7970,study region chahannur lake an inland lake of the inner mongolia plateau is located in the typical agro pastoral ecotone china study focus change of lake area is highly sensitive to climate change and human activities but the internal driving mechanism so far remains unclear in this study the spatiotemporal distribution of chahannur lake over the past 30 years was accurately extracted using the ndvi data and the corresponding driver analysis was conducted new hydrological insights for the region before 2000 chahannur lake was always remaining watery state throughout the year and the maximum area reached 90 km2 however after 2000 it became a seasonal lake with a long term dry state during the observed period the recovery of water body had only occurred in two stages both of which belonged to historically heavy rain years and the maximum lake area was only 40 km2 although the climate has tended to be warm and humid after 2000 it cannot completely reverse the lake s drying additionally the irrigated arable increased by 392 km2 in 2000 2017 and the increased arable consumed substantial groundwater for meeting agricultural demands which consequently caused rapid shrinkage of the lake notably the increase of ndvi is widely distributed in irrigated arable with high water consuming crops overall groundwater over exploitation and strong water consumption from crops have jointly led to the drying of chahannur lake keywords ndvi irrigation lake drying chahannur lake water resources exploitation 1 introduction lakes are not only important water resources in arid and semi arid regions but also are sensitive indicators of climate and environmental changes yang et al 2019 peng et al 2015 guo et al 2003 the formation and disappearance expansion and shrinkage of lakes and the evolutionary process of their ecology are caused by a combination of global and regional geography and climate change petrov and normatov 2010 the area and water tables of lakes can objectively reflect the water balance process in the semi arid inland basin thereby maintaining the stability of regional ecosystems klein et al 2014 arkian et al 2016 however at present wetland degradation and lake shrinkage have become prominent challenges in the semi arid areas of china and have threatened regional ecological security seriously chahannur lake is a typical inland saline lake located in the semi arid agro pastoral ecotone of china with serious land degradation and wind erosion which are the last line of defense against the southward invasion of otindag sandy land in beijing tianjin hebei region coupled with unreasonable human mining activities the lake s water body has dried up many times liu 2008 mentioned that before 1996 no water saving irrigation measures were adopted and traditional flood irrigation was mainly employed since the 1950 s the area of other lakes in the chahannur basin has been shrinking gradually and most permanent lakes have become seasonal ones although irrigation can balance the shortcoming of crops due to the lack of water and low yield it wastes water resources and deteriorates ecological environments rakhmatullaev et al 2013 chaudhari et al 2018 hillel et al 2015 additionally it is one of the cardinal wetlands serving as an ecological barrier for beijing tianjin hebei region ecological problems such as biodiversity reduction sandstorms and land salinization caused by lake shrinkage have attracted the attention of the government and other relevant departments wang et al 2004 husar et al 2001 therefore this study aims to reveal the area change of chahannur lake explore its influencing factors and provide a reference basis for the stable development of water resource utilization in the basin at present the most effective and popular method for lake area extraction involves the selection of different water body indexes and thresholds using remote sensing images through analyzing their change trends and exploring the natural and anthropogenic driving forces tan et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 jing et al 2018 kim et al 2012 in the 1990s guirguis et al 1996 used multi temporal false color synthetic images as a data source combined with principal component analysis to detect areal changes in the brullus lake in egypt over the past ten years the results showed that the area of the lake was shrinking at an average rate of 8 6 km2 per year under the influence of human reclamation as an important water source in central asia the aral sea has shrunk by 6 19 104 km2 between 1960 and 2018 wang et al 2020 many studies have argued that the reductions in the lake area were mainly affected by the reduction in precipitation and the increase in agricultural irrigation bai et al 2011a 2011b shadkam et al 2016 wine et al 2019 instead the water area around the aral sea increases obviously with upstream runoff a decrease in water withdrawal and an increase in agricultural drainage chen et al 2014 2016 2017 deng and chen 2017 as one of the three most concentrated regions of lakes in china inner mongolia is experiencing sharp reductions in the lake area ma et al 2010 the exposed saline alkali land after wetland degradation has become the main source of sand and sandstorms khazaei et al 2019 wine and laronne 2020 paerl et al 2011 changes in plateau lakes from the 1970 s to the 2000 s were extracted with multi temporal landsat images along with the driving forces studied by the authors namely precipitation was the leading factor for the changes in lakes in inner mongolia however in the local cultivated area the continuous development of irrigated agriculture is a dominant factor in lake degradation tao et al 2015 according to the above studies we can summarize that in plateau regions with minimal human interference and the climate s warming and wetting the lake area showed an increasing trend however in areas with dense crop cultivation such as plains the main driving force of lake reduction was the contradiction between water supply and consumption which was caused by different degrees of exploitation from human activities zhang et al 2017 chahannur is an important part of the bashang plateau wetland group and only a few systematic studies have been conducted there lakes with an area of more than 1 km2 in the bashang plateau from 1984 to 2015 were examined the number of lakes decreased by 127 and the total area shrunk by 174 19 km2 in the past 30 years gao 2019 although this study compensates for the lack of time series continuity and quantitative analysis it did not analyze the changes in irrigation crops and vegetation coverage in the basin therefore this study selected the chahannur basin located on the edge of the inner mongolia plateau as the research object updated the time series to 2019 and determined the stage when it became a seasonal lake finally combining climate factors especially the yearly patterns of different precipitation intensities and human activities dominated by the change in irrigated cultivated land we analyzed the main driving forces of the changes in different stages this study provides a reference for reducing the regional ecological risk and making it a solid ecological barrier for beijing and tianjin 2 material and method 2 1 study area chahannur lake is a typical inland lake in semi arid area with an irregular shape which is approximately 17 km long from southwest to northeast and 5 5 km wide from northwest to southeast two thirds of the lake is in shangdu county and one third in shangyi county the chahannur basin is located at 41 00 42 10 n and 113 10 114 30 e and belongs to the transition zone from the inner mongolia plateau to the northern hebei mountain the total area is approximately 7314 km2 and it covers parts of shangdu county huade county xinghe county chahaerqian banner xianghuang banner in inner mongolia and kangbao county shangyi county and zhangbei county in hebei province fig 1 the terrain of the chahannur basin is low in the center and high around with an average altitude of 1419 74 m it is also a source of sandstorms and vegetable supply in beijing and tianjin the climate is influenced by siberian and the annual average temperature and precipitation are 4 69 and lower than 400 mm respectively however the annual water surface evaporation is 1735 7 mm which is 4 75 times larger than the precipitation level sun et al 2014 the river system dried up and the lake water was mainly supplied by precipitation and surface runoff according to the observation data from the shangdu hydrological station the measured runoff from 1956 to 2016 was 2 64 million m3 and the annual average runoff depth was approximately 5 mm drought events were very serious wang and long 2006 and apart from natural rainfall recharge irrigation became a prevailing measure to replenish the water required by crops to increase yield taking the kangbao area in the northeast of chahannur as a case due to the large scale planting of vegetables in this area well irrigation is in a saturated state which eventually led to the decline of shrub survival rate from about 40 in 2004 to almost zero in 2008 li et al 2009 2 2 data meteorological data were obtained from the national meteorological science data center https data cma cn including the precipitation temperature wind speed net radiation flux and sensible heat flux into the soil from january 1980 to december 2019 table 1 the original data were integrated with penman monteith to obtain the reference evapotranspiration et0 and the rainfall patterns and temporal variation trends were obtained using mathematical methods the avhrr ndvi dataset with a resolution of 0 01 for 1 day was obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration http www class noaa gov nsaa products welcome after radiometric and geographic calibrations the cloud free images covering the study area were selected as the metadata for the chahannur lake area extraction during 1991 1999 the mod13q1 ndvi dataset was obtained from https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov search and the lake area changes from 2000 to 2019 were extracted after the mrt and clipped pml v2 evapotranspiration dataset which is obtained from google earth engine with a resolution of 500 m for 8 d zhang et al 2019 census data including areas of cropland statistics agriculture yield cropland irrigation areas gdp number of pumped wells and changes in groundwater were also obtained these datasets were used to analyze the impact of human activities on the lake area 2 3 method 2 3 1 extraction of the water surface using remote sensing data the ndvi is calculated by near infrared nir and infrared bands using the following formula tucker 1979 1 ndvi nir r nir r under normal circumstances it can reflect the information of vegetation coverage but with increasing incident energy of water absorption the ndvi values of water are usually negative therefore based on this difference we can distinguish the water bodies and non water pixels in ndvi images hereher 2015 yu et al 2020 basofi et al 2019 given the difference of spatial scale between the avhrr ndvi and modis ndvi data the extraction results need verification owing to the discontinuity of temporal and spatial resolutions of landsat data and the interference of clouds 53 landsat images were screened using 99 landsat images downloaded from 1991 to 2019 fig 2a after the comparison with the extraction results from the corresponding date of avhrr and modis the fitness was found to be high with a correlation of 0 94 fig 2b combined with its spatial distribution results fig 3 landsat can identify the ponding area of the surrounding depressions and small rivers in the valleys after rainfall which affects the extraction accuracy of the area of chahannur lake additionally it has been difficult to realize a change in the lake area on a continuous scale for many years in contrast the modis based results not only detect the interannual and seasonal changes in the lake area over a long time but also eliminate the errors of temporary small puddles and rivers caused by heavy rain thus a more effective expression for lake areas greater than 1 km2 could be obtained taking 1991 as the baseline we calculated the decline rates of lake area in 2003 2010 and 2017 compared with 1991 were 60 55 and 98 respectively 2 3 2 climate wetness index the wetness index is a drought assessment index based on the natural water balance it reflects the balance between the main input precipitation and output evapotranspiration of natural water according to the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration it is a drought and flood evaluation index in the sense of climate and is given as follows 2 c w i p e t 0 where et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm d 1 p is precipitation in addition to climate anthropogenic activities lead to changes in the area of chahannur lake these factors include the agriculture yield changes in gdp irrigated area wells and changes in the depth of the groundwater table these unreasonable anthropogenic activities in the basin may have caused an imbalance in water resources and ecosystems enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model estarfm ndvi data with high spatiotemporal resolution from 2000 to 2017 were initially obtained by the estarfm model and the ndvi time series curve of the crop growth period in the basin was then reconstructed using the hants filter we then extracted the distribution of irrigated cropland and crops from 2000 to 2017 chen et al 2021 and analyzed regional water use in conjunction with groundwater level data from regional observation wells table 2 2 3 3 trend analysis approach we calculated the interannual variation trend of ndvi in each grid by the mann kendall test which is a non parametric statistical method for analyzing the changing trend of elements with time series the advantage of this method is that the data don t need to ensure the normal distribution and affected outliers it is convenient to calculate and has a wide range of applications stoimenova 2010 suppose there are n samples x 1 x 2 x n the statistics of m k test for time series x are as follows 3 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where sgn is a symbolic function which is defined as follows 4 sgn θ 1 θ 0 0 θ 0 1 θ 0 n 10 s is approximately normal distribution its average value is 0 and the variance v s is 5 v s n n 1 2 n 5 18 6 z s 1 v s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v s s 0 for the given confidence level α if z z 1 α 2 it has an obvious trend change in time series data z 0 indicates that the sequence shows an increasing trend and z 0 indicates that the sequence shows a decreasing trend the 95 confidence is used as the minimum standard to judge whether there is a significant trend change z 1 96 2 3 4 granger causality tests and convergent cross mapping to determine the causal relationship between climate change and human activities and lake area analyses were carried out using gc and ccm tests considering the seasonal variation in the lake area chose the monthly scale climatic factors which include precipitation temperature and climatic wetness indices however the temporal resolution of irrigated land agricultural production gdp and groundwater are annual so we chose monthly et corresponding to irrigated land as an anthropogenic factor granger causality tests gc explain that the change of a variable is affected by the past behavior of itself and other variables granger 1969 when the two variables have a lag relationship in time series we can statistically investigate whether the relationship is unilateral or mutual fornarelli et al 2013 consider two random processes x t and y t assuming that they are jointly stationary and that each process has an autoregressive representation then it is completed by the constrained f test and the formula is as follows 7 y t i 1 m α i x t i i 1 m β i y t i μ 1 t 8 h 0 α 1 α 2 α m 0 h 0 is the original hypothesis of the gc test if h 0 α 1 α 2 α m 0 x does not the granger cause y if h 0 α 1 α 2 α m 0 x does the granger cause y additionally the gc test has lag characteristics akaike info criterion aic and schwaiz criterion sc were used to evaluate the optimal lag order and the optimal lag order corresponds to the minimum value of aic and sc the precondition of gc tests is that the cause must occur before the result for some without logical relationship variables is full of limitations to obtain the causal relationship between variables with weak coupling sugihara et al 2012 proposed a method called convergent cross mapping ccm to analyze the causal relationship between variables of nonlinear systems with weak to medium coupling strength it judged the causal relationship by whether the historical information can accurately estimate the degree of the trigger vatable according to the embedding theorem of takens 1981 construct the attractor manifold m x and m y of time series x and y with lagged variables tani et al 2020 where satisfied the 9 x t x t x t τ x t 2 τ x t e 1 τ 10 y t y t y t τ y t 2 τ y t e 1 τ where the e is the embedding dimension of x t and y t and the range is 1 e 1 τ t l more ccm algorithms can be obtained in the redm package of r bartsev et al 2021 clark et al 2015 ye et al 2015 3 results 3 1 regional ecological environment 3 1 1 change in the chahannur lake area we extracted the area of chahannur lake in the growing season of the crop april to october using remote sensing data since 1991 the trend is shown in fig 4 where water existed until 2000 the maximum water surface area reached as much as 90 km2 between 1994 and 1995 after which the lake area decreased rapidly at a rate of 0 013 km2 a and turned into a seasonal lake in 2000 the largest area of the lake decreased from 76 23 km2 in 1991 17 44 km2 in 2000 the area of chahannur lake fluctuated widely but there were no obvious changes in trends only a certain extent of water surface was recovered in the summer of rainy years the maximum area of water surface reached 30 km2 from 2003 to 2004 but it dried for the subsequent 7 years from 2010 2014 precipitation showed an increasing trend again simultaneously the lake surface also began to recover up to nearly 40 km2 since 2015 chahannur lake dried for the second time and go on until nowadays 3 1 2 change of vegetation index in the basin in the last 20 years the average and maximum values of the vegetation index both showed an increasing trend and this has been more significant since 2009 fig 5a the vegetation declined gradually and the average and maximum values decreased from 0 29 and 0 48 in 2000 0 23 and 0 32 in 2009 respectively subsequently it gradually recovered from 2009 to 2019 and became stable after 2018 according to previous studies zhang et al 2017 su et al 2018 precipitation has a positive effect on ndvi changes precipitation in the study area decreased significantly from 2000 to 2008 which inhibited the increase in vegetation cover while it increased continuously after 2008 which promoted an increase in ndvi the spatial distribution of the ndvi change trend in the study area was divided into five types by using the mann kendall trend test these included an extremely significant decrease significant decrease insignificant change a significant increase and an extremely significant increase since 2000 the spatial distribution including the extremely significant increase in vegetation has been consistent with the emergence of irrigated cultivated land the higher altitude areas in the northwest show obvious vegetation degradation but vegetation in the southeast increases significantly fig 5b this indicates that the expansion of irrigation activities significantly improves the biomass of irrigated farmland in the basin and drives the average vegetation coverage however irrigation and other human activities cause a decline in the groundwater table and the water in the high lying areas cannot supplement the needs for vegetation growth over time the natural grassland showed a trend of degradation which further shows that human activities have a greater effect on the vegetation coverage in this area 3 2 change of climate factors and their impact on the lake area 3 2 1 meteorological factors we chose the annual average meteorological variables including precipitation temperature and climate wetness index to analyze the relationship between meteorological factors and the lake area based on the data from the meteorological stations around chahannur lake over the past 40 years overall the climate change shows a trend of warming and humidification the precipitation in the five counties showed a stable increasing trend except for shangdu county fig 6a1 b1 c1 d1 e1 f1 the average increase rate was only 0 824 mm a but became 9 55 mm a in the last 10 years the maximum precipitation in 2018 and the minimum precipitation in 2009 were 451 mm and 237 mm respectively the increases in the annual average temperature at the six stations averaged 0 042 c a which is consistent with climate warming fig 6a2 b2 c2 d2 e2 and f2 the wetness index p et0 showed a consistent increase of 0 07 a in recent years in shangdu and xinghe fig 6a3 b3 except for the kangbao station fig 6c3 which remained unchanged the p et0 of other stations fig 6d3 e3 and f3 showed an increasing trend indicating that the climate in the region has entirely become wetter since 2005 and is beneficial to the increases in runoff and lake surface area 3 2 2 change in rainfall patterns the rainfall was divided into three types after further analysis according to the standard of the china meteorological administration light rain daily precipitation 10 mm moderate rain 10 mm daily precipitation 25 mm and heavy rain 25 mm daily precipitation 50 mm we found that the light rain in the study area has almost no change at all except for a slight decrease in the last 10 years the change rates of light rain in the shangdu and shangyi both were 0 03 mm a which are more significant than those at other stations fig 7a d g j m p the changes in moderate rain are opposite to those of light rain all the stations showed an increasing trend for nearly ten years fig 7b e h n except for shangyi fig 7k and kangbao fig 7q decreased from 2016 the change in heavy rain was not obvious but shangyi county near chahannur lake had a gradient ascent in the last 10 years with the temperature rise the climate wetness index has made the basin relatively warm and humid compared to that during 1980 2009 the results also indicate that climate change in the basin positively influences the increase in the lake area 3 2 3 influence of climatic factors climate change is a key factor in the increase and decrease of lake areas only when excluding human activities many studies dan 2019 bai 2016 wang et al 2022 have argued that the lake groups in inner mongolia have shrunk due to the integrated roles of decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature conversely the lake area can recover with increasing precipitation and climate wetness index by analyzing the changes of the lake area precipitation and frequency of heavy rain we found that the degree of the lake drying in the second disappearance period 2015 2019 of the lake surface was much greater than that in the first 2006 2009 fig 8 however the precipitation showed an insignificant decreasing trend over the past 40 years and the precipitation in the second disappearance period was higher than that in the first it is even beneficial as it increases the water surface therefore we included the causes of the differences between the two disappearance periods as the continuous increase in irrigated farmland leads to serious surface and underground water scarcity lacking runoff and groundwater recharge in rivers and lakes the water body did not recover even though the precipitation increased significantly the deterioration of the ecological environment caused by the destruction of the surface environment is irreversible therefore human activities need to be considered as influencing factors for further analyses 3 3 impacts of human activities on the lake area 3 3 1 temporal and spatial variation of agricultural land cover in the basin the temporal and spatial distributions of irrigated cultivated land from 2000 to 2017 were extracted by cart classification and the spatial distribution is shown in fig 9 the high terrain in the north of the basin makes it difficult to extract groundwater and there are few irrigated lands the rain fed land is also significantly reduced owing to the lack of sufficient water supply leaving only the irrigated land dominated by sunflowers sugar beets and potatoes in the gully area the irrigation land in the southeast is densely distributed which is the breeding and planting area of vegetables sunflowers sugar beets and potatoes the distribution of irrigated land is concentrated close to the central part of chahannur lake owing to adequate water extraction statistics show that irrigated land has increased gradually and rain fed land has decreased every year in 2000 the rain fed farmland in the chahannur lake basin was 263 83 103 ha and only 152 91 103 ha of land comprised the irrigated farmland which was mainly distributed around chahannur lake since the implementation of the grain for green project of china in 1999 the planting structure in this area has been readjusted and its pillar industry has gradually changed from dry farming to an irrigation based vegetable industry the total area of cropland increased from 352 12 103 ha in 2000 397 12 103 ha in 2008 with the continuous development of the vegetable basket project in the bashang plateau area of hebei province the planting scale of vegetables has gradually expanded vegetable planting bases were established by considering daqinggou and qijia towns of shangyi county as examples cultivated land was constantly being reclaimed by local farmers and irrigation devices were installed although agricultural production was developing it destroyed the water resources sustainability of the basin the final irrigated land increased to 254 24 103 ha and the rain fed land was reduced to 142 88 103 ha by 2017 the total area of cultivated land in the basin was 334 93 103 ha indicating a decrease of 62 19 103 ha compared to the 2008 level the area of irrigated cultivated land was distributed throughout the basin and it was reduced to 192 09 103 ha while only some grain products such as wheat naked oats and flax were planted in the rain fed land which remained unchanged at 142 84 103 ha chen et al 2021 additionally the primary industry and yield of major crops in the basin increased by 245 and 402 respectively from 2000 to 2018 fig 10 3 3 2 change in groundwater in the basin the middle and lower areas are the most important agricultural production regions in the chahannur basin owing to the dry climate and lack of rain irrigation has become the main agricultural activity to increase crop yield water resources are a massive extraction and unreasonable use has inevitably led to a serious decline in groundwater according to the investigation results of the geological survey bureau the annual average total water resources of the chahannur basin was 153 10 108 million m3 including 39 68 102 million m3 of surface water resources 127 72 102 million m3 of groundwater resources and 66 55 102 million m3 of exploitable groundwater resources table 3 however the changes in surface water groundwater and total resources decreased by 72 24 and 33 respectively from the second water resource assessment in 1995 2000 to the third one in 2001 2016 the results of the water resources bulletin of inner mongolia also showed that the total water supply in 2019 was 79 93 million m3 which increased by 20 00 million m3 compared to 2000 subsequently we divided the total water supply by water derived as groundwater supply wherein 75 87 million m3 accounted for 94 9 and the recycled supply after sewage treatment 40 60 million m3 accounted for 5 1 according to the ways of water consumption the agricultural water uses were 62 24 million m3 which accounted for 80 4 of the total water consumption the domestic water was 9 80 million m3 which accounted for 12 2 of the total water consumption the industrial and urban ecological water usages were 4 24 million m3 and 1 65 million m3 which accounted for 5 3 and 2 1 respectively through the statistical analysis the degree of water resource exploitation and utilization was approximately 90 the ecological fragility and arid climate have restricted the economic development of the basin to develop irrigated agriculture and improve land use efficiency drilling wells have become a popular agricultural method in the basin since 2000 considering inner mongolia and hebei province as examples by coordinating and calculating the datum of the statistical yearbook of the aforementioned two provinces we confirmed that there were 5162 wells in the inner mongolia part of the basin there was an increase in 1966 compared with the year 2000 among which 4159 wells were in shangdu county 871 in xinghe county 127 in huade county and 5 in chayouqian banner the number of wells in the northern hebei mountainous area increased from 888 in 2000 3150 in 2017 which was an increase of 254 this phenomenon led to the large scale exploitation of water resources and the continuous decline in water levels in the basin in 2000 the buried depth of groundwater in the basin was generally shallow and only a few scattered groundwater table depths exceeded 5 m additionally numerous groundwater over exploitation areas have not appeared and the average buried depth of groundwater was 3 74 m the groundwater table depth around chahannur lake is less than 3 m which is close to nature as the irrigated area increased the amount of groundwater exploitation increased in 2018 the groundwater was 12 67 m with an average drop of 8 93 m from 2000 fig 11 the aforementioned buried depth data of the groundwater area were obtained from the geological survey bureau 3 4 analysis of gc and ccm causality tests in conducting the granger test the adf unit root test is first required for all time series of each influence factor and the null hypothesis of the existence of a unit root p 0 05 is rejected for all tests so all time series are smooth time series then the appropriate lag order for each pair of causality tests was determined as a way to improve the fit the final results are shown in table 4 the p value of precipitation and cwi does not granger cause area is less than 0 05 which means the precipitation and cwi is the granger cause of lake area the result of temperature explained that it does not the cause of lake area the p value of et does not granger cause area is smaller than the test for lake area on et therefore et is considered to be a factor of the lake area results of all factor tests found that seasonal climatic factors have a greater impact on the lake area than inter annual variation thus both climatic factors and et correspond to monthly variations in the lake area the convergent cross mapping should first determine the optimal embedding dimension e the optimal embedding dimension e of the climatic factor time series chosen is 10 and the embedding dimension of the human activity et is 3 the results show that precipitation and temperature are the causes of lake area while the climate wetness index belongs to the normalized sample and has a different order of magnitude from the lake area leading to the error of ccm analysis results in addition fig 12d shows that et is the cause of lake area the combined gc and ccm causality tests demonstrate that the lake area is most influenced by precipitation but with the intensification of human activities surface and groundwater are continuously exploited for agricultural irrigation and precipitation increases but is not sufficient to recharge runoff and surface water and the lake area gradually shrinks or even difficult to recover 4 discussion chahannur lake an inland lake in the agro pastoral ecotone of china is an important water resource although previous studies have analyzed lake changes in arid and semi arid regions those have seldom detected the period when it became a seasonal lake additionally current domestic and foreign scholars have evaluated the evolution trend and driving factors of the lake area and water level in different regions zhang et al 2017 jing et al 2019 international studies about lake research mostly focus on the analysis of climate change thakuri et al 2016 and the impacting factors of human activities are not comprehensively considered in terms of the time series it is difficult to obtain long term continuous series of remote sensing image data therefore most studies used intermittent remote sensing data to analyze the dynamic changes in different lake areas and there was a lack of continuous monitoring cai et al 2016 this study qualitatively analyzes the impact of driving forces including climate and anthropogenic factors on changes in the lake more quantitative works were required in the future especially regarding the effects of different rain on the temporary water surface increase and multi year scale change the establishment of the model can not only quantify the contribution rate of influencing factors to lake change but also analyze the internal relationship of each influencing factor jepsen et al 2013 we found the inflow source and amount of the lake subtracted its expenditure and waste and established a suitable model for water balance in the study area quinton et al 2009 cheng et al 2017 depicted that heavy rainfall will produce a certain amount of recharge under arid and semi arid conditions by using observation data this is similar to the results of our results wherein the increase in the water area was related to runoff which was produced by increases in the climate wetness index and heavy rain however the actual runoff change in the basin did not achieve the expected results and the lake area gradually shrank the climate in this basin has been warm and humid in the past 40 years which was conducive to increasing the area of the lake however the lake has been shrinking to a seasonal lake which is mainly influenced by human activities additionally most of the traditional rain fed agriculture in the chahannur lake basin has been replaced by irrigated agriculture implying that the demand for water resources is bound to increase sharply in most arid areas the counties pursue crop yield making irrigated land a popular agricultural method and planting some high water consuming crops to ensure their products and export rakhmatullaev et al 2010 2011 li and tao 2009 conducted a detailed study on the vegetable industry and water resources in the bashang plateau and believed that the development of the vegetable industry caused not only a serious drop in the groundwater table and continued shrinkage of surface water but also the subsequent desertification of the area therefore it is necessary to adjust the planting structure based on water saving irrigation due to the lack of hydrological stations in chahannur lake basin and inability to obtain observation data such as runoff and water table this study lacks quantitative analysis therefore the paper performed the gc and ccm to improve the robustness of methodology and results gc test can play a powerful role in pure random or linear systems with satisfied separability and gaussian distribution fornarelli et al 2013 bressler and seth 2011 however when two variables are affected by a common factor at the same time how to distinguish the causality and correlation of the two variables is limited sugihara et al 2012 ccm with convergence characteristics cannot substitute gc but a supplement for it that is the larger causal variable sample is the smaller the ccm estimation error will be ma et al 2014 its advantages are distinguishing the time lag of causal influence eliminating the impact of confounding factors and making up short term order clear et al 2015 however one of the defects of ccm is that when reason x has a strong impact on result although x and y are single causalities ccm often mistakenly considered that there is a bilateral causality so we concluded that ccm cannot distinguish between bilateral causality and strong single causality ye et al 2015 results of ccm detected the precipitation temperature cwi and et and lake area are mutually causal but the former has a greater impact among them precipitation played an increasingly important role in the recovery of lakes especially in the semi arid inland lake with precipitation as the main input source zhou et al 2019 nevertheless with the mismatched spatial distribution of land and water resources and high intensity human activities water scarcity crisis has occurred in arid and semi arid areas chen et al 2018 this phenomenon also reflected the interannual fluctuation of lake area was affected by precipitation whereas the shrinkage of lakes was dominated by increasing water consumption of land surface wang et al 2022 chahannur lake basin is one of the most essential habitats for species such as migratory waterfowl in arid and semi arid areas and decreases in lake volume lead to reductions in species diversity intensified desertification and serious ecological crisis ramsar 2008 owing to a lack of water supply the natural vegetation showed continuous degradation which accelerated the process of land desertification however chahannur lake basin is an ecological barrier and vegetable supply source for beijing and balancing the transformation of ecological value and economic value is a serious question additionally the situation of water resource utilization in the bashang area was evaluated by researchers the statistics showed that the groundwater table depth in the bashang area gradually dropped from 3 to 15 17 m during 1990 s 2005 land surface water also drastically reduced during the same period the number of lakes decreased by 205 the area decreased by 99 88 km2 and the water storage capacity of lakes decreased by 119 million m3 han 2011 based on the above discussions the standardization of agricultural irrigation projects the institutionalization of well drilling water projects and the reasonable arrangement of water fees should be implemented by the government 5 conclusions based on remote sensing data we revealed the temporal and spatial changes in the area of chahannur lake from 1991 to 2019 r2 reached 0 94 by the verification of 53 landsat extracted results during the same period we then analyzed the driving forces of the lake area shrinkage by natural factors including the annual precipitation average annual temperature climate wetness index and anthropogenic activities dominated by irrigated land agricultural yield gdp groundwater table depth and et the conclusions are as follows the area of the chahannur lake water surface decreased from 76 23 km2 in 1991 4 06 km2 in 2019 and became a seasonal lake in 2000 the degree of drying up in the second disappearance period of the lake surface was much greater than that in the first disappearance period the natural vegetation has been replaced by artificial vegetation the spatial distribution of the ndvi change trend showed that the increase in regional vegetation mainly occurred in irrigated areas while northern mountainous areas showed obvious vegetation degradation the climate tends to be warm and humid throughout the entire basin over the past 40 years irrigated land increased annually and the number of groundwater wells increased by 2 55 the average groundwater table depth decreased by 8 93 m in nearly 20 years the results of the granger causality test and ccm showed that both precipitation and et are main factors of the increase of the lake area but the increase of precipitation did not lead to an increase of lake area therefore the reduction in groundwater caused by irrigation pumping is a more dominant factor than precipitation credit authorship contribution statement xiaolu chen conceptualization investigation calculation writing original draft preparation

7970,study region chahannur lake an inland lake of the inner mongolia plateau is located in the typical agro pastoral ecotone china study focus change of lake area is highly sensitive to climate change and human activities but the internal driving mechanism so far remains unclear in this study the spatiotemporal distribution of chahannur lake over the past 30 years was accurately extracted using the ndvi data and the corresponding driver analysis was conducted new hydrological insights for the region before 2000 chahannur lake was always remaining watery state throughout the year and the maximum area reached 90 km2 however after 2000 it became a seasonal lake with a long term dry state during the observed period the recovery of water body had only occurred in two stages both of which belonged to historically heavy rain years and the maximum lake area was only 40 km2 although the climate has tended to be warm and humid after 2000 it cannot completely reverse the lake s drying additionally the irrigated arable increased by 392 km2 in 2000 2017 and the increased arable consumed substantial groundwater for meeting agricultural demands which consequently caused rapid shrinkage of the lake notably the increase of ndvi is widely distributed in irrigated arable with high water consuming crops overall groundwater over exploitation and strong water consumption from crops have jointly led to the drying of chahannur lake keywords ndvi irrigation lake drying chahannur lake water resources exploitation 1 introduction lakes are not only important water resources in arid and semi arid regions but also are sensitive indicators of climate and environmental changes yang et al 2019 peng et al 2015 guo et al 2003 the formation and disappearance expansion and shrinkage of lakes and the evolutionary process of their ecology are caused by a combination of global and regional geography and climate change petrov and normatov 2010 the area and water tables of lakes can objectively reflect the water balance process in the semi arid inland basin thereby maintaining the stability of regional ecosystems klein et al 2014 arkian et al 2016 however at present wetland degradation and lake shrinkage have become prominent challenges in the semi arid areas of china and have threatened regional ecological security seriously chahannur lake is a typical inland saline lake located in the semi arid agro pastoral ecotone of china with serious land degradation and wind erosion which are the last line of defense against the southward invasion of otindag sandy land in beijing tianjin hebei region coupled with unreasonable human mining activities the lake s water body has dried up many times liu 2008 mentioned that before 1996 no water saving irrigation measures were adopted and traditional flood irrigation was mainly employed since the 1950 s the area of other lakes in the chahannur basin has been shrinking gradually and most permanent lakes have become seasonal ones although irrigation can balance the shortcoming of crops due to the lack of water and low yield it wastes water resources and deteriorates ecological environments rakhmatullaev et al 2013 chaudhari et al 2018 hillel et al 2015 additionally it is one of the cardinal wetlands serving as an ecological barrier for beijing tianjin hebei region ecological problems such as biodiversity reduction sandstorms and land salinization caused by lake shrinkage have attracted the attention of the government and other relevant departments wang et al 2004 husar et al 2001 therefore this study aims to reveal the area change of chahannur lake explore its influencing factors and provide a reference basis for the stable development of water resource utilization in the basin at present the most effective and popular method for lake area extraction involves the selection of different water body indexes and thresholds using remote sensing images through analyzing their change trends and exploring the natural and anthropogenic driving forces tan et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 jing et al 2018 kim et al 2012 in the 1990s guirguis et al 1996 used multi temporal false color synthetic images as a data source combined with principal component analysis to detect areal changes in the brullus lake in egypt over the past ten years the results showed that the area of the lake was shrinking at an average rate of 8 6 km2 per year under the influence of human reclamation as an important water source in central asia the aral sea has shrunk by 6 19 104 km2 between 1960 and 2018 wang et al 2020 many studies have argued that the reductions in the lake area were mainly affected by the reduction in precipitation and the increase in agricultural irrigation bai et al 2011a 2011b shadkam et al 2016 wine et al 2019 instead the water area around the aral sea increases obviously with upstream runoff a decrease in water withdrawal and an increase in agricultural drainage chen et al 2014 2016 2017 deng and chen 2017 as one of the three most concentrated regions of lakes in china inner mongolia is experiencing sharp reductions in the lake area ma et al 2010 the exposed saline alkali land after wetland degradation has become the main source of sand and sandstorms khazaei et al 2019 wine and laronne 2020 paerl et al 2011 changes in plateau lakes from the 1970 s to the 2000 s were extracted with multi temporal landsat images along with the driving forces studied by the authors namely precipitation was the leading factor for the changes in lakes in inner mongolia however in the local cultivated area the continuous development of irrigated agriculture is a dominant factor in lake degradation tao et al 2015 according to the above studies we can summarize that in plateau regions with minimal human interference and the climate s warming and wetting the lake area showed an increasing trend however in areas with dense crop cultivation such as plains the main driving force of lake reduction was the contradiction between water supply and consumption which was caused by different degrees of exploitation from human activities zhang et al 2017 chahannur is an important part of the bashang plateau wetland group and only a few systematic studies have been conducted there lakes with an area of more than 1 km2 in the bashang plateau from 1984 to 2015 were examined the number of lakes decreased by 127 and the total area shrunk by 174 19 km2 in the past 30 years gao 2019 although this study compensates for the lack of time series continuity and quantitative analysis it did not analyze the changes in irrigation crops and vegetation coverage in the basin therefore this study selected the chahannur basin located on the edge of the inner mongolia plateau as the research object updated the time series to 2019 and determined the stage when it became a seasonal lake finally combining climate factors especially the yearly patterns of different precipitation intensities and human activities dominated by the change in irrigated cultivated land we analyzed the main driving forces of the changes in different stages this study provides a reference for reducing the regional ecological risk and making it a solid ecological barrier for beijing and tianjin 2 material and method 2 1 study area chahannur lake is a typical inland lake in semi arid area with an irregular shape which is approximately 17 km long from southwest to northeast and 5 5 km wide from northwest to southeast two thirds of the lake is in shangdu county and one third in shangyi county the chahannur basin is located at 41 00 42 10 n and 113 10 114 30 e and belongs to the transition zone from the inner mongolia plateau to the northern hebei mountain the total area is approximately 7314 km2 and it covers parts of shangdu county huade county xinghe county chahaerqian banner xianghuang banner in inner mongolia and kangbao county shangyi county and zhangbei county in hebei province fig 1 the terrain of the chahannur basin is low in the center and high around with an average altitude of 1419 74 m it is also a source of sandstorms and vegetable supply in beijing and tianjin the climate is influenced by siberian and the annual average temperature and precipitation are 4 69 and lower than 400 mm respectively however the annual water surface evaporation is 1735 7 mm which is 4 75 times larger than the precipitation level sun et al 2014 the river system dried up and the lake water was mainly supplied by precipitation and surface runoff according to the observation data from the shangdu hydrological station the measured runoff from 1956 to 2016 was 2 64 million m3 and the annual average runoff depth was approximately 5 mm drought events were very serious wang and long 2006 and apart from natural rainfall recharge irrigation became a prevailing measure to replenish the water required by crops to increase yield taking the kangbao area in the northeast of chahannur as a case due to the large scale planting of vegetables in this area well irrigation is in a saturated state which eventually led to the decline of shrub survival rate from about 40 in 2004 to almost zero in 2008 li et al 2009 2 2 data meteorological data were obtained from the national meteorological science data center https data cma cn including the precipitation temperature wind speed net radiation flux and sensible heat flux into the soil from january 1980 to december 2019 table 1 the original data were integrated with penman monteith to obtain the reference evapotranspiration et0 and the rainfall patterns and temporal variation trends were obtained using mathematical methods the avhrr ndvi dataset with a resolution of 0 01 for 1 day was obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration http www class noaa gov nsaa products welcome after radiometric and geographic calibrations the cloud free images covering the study area were selected as the metadata for the chahannur lake area extraction during 1991 1999 the mod13q1 ndvi dataset was obtained from https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov search and the lake area changes from 2000 to 2019 were extracted after the mrt and clipped pml v2 evapotranspiration dataset which is obtained from google earth engine with a resolution of 500 m for 8 d zhang et al 2019 census data including areas of cropland statistics agriculture yield cropland irrigation areas gdp number of pumped wells and changes in groundwater were also obtained these datasets were used to analyze the impact of human activities on the lake area 2 3 method 2 3 1 extraction of the water surface using remote sensing data the ndvi is calculated by near infrared nir and infrared bands using the following formula tucker 1979 1 ndvi nir r nir r under normal circumstances it can reflect the information of vegetation coverage but with increasing incident energy of water absorption the ndvi values of water are usually negative therefore based on this difference we can distinguish the water bodies and non water pixels in ndvi images hereher 2015 yu et al 2020 basofi et al 2019 given the difference of spatial scale between the avhrr ndvi and modis ndvi data the extraction results need verification owing to the discontinuity of temporal and spatial resolutions of landsat data and the interference of clouds 53 landsat images were screened using 99 landsat images downloaded from 1991 to 2019 fig 2a after the comparison with the extraction results from the corresponding date of avhrr and modis the fitness was found to be high with a correlation of 0 94 fig 2b combined with its spatial distribution results fig 3 landsat can identify the ponding area of the surrounding depressions and small rivers in the valleys after rainfall which affects the extraction accuracy of the area of chahannur lake additionally it has been difficult to realize a change in the lake area on a continuous scale for many years in contrast the modis based results not only detect the interannual and seasonal changes in the lake area over a long time but also eliminate the errors of temporary small puddles and rivers caused by heavy rain thus a more effective expression for lake areas greater than 1 km2 could be obtained taking 1991 as the baseline we calculated the decline rates of lake area in 2003 2010 and 2017 compared with 1991 were 60 55 and 98 respectively 2 3 2 climate wetness index the wetness index is a drought assessment index based on the natural water balance it reflects the balance between the main input precipitation and output evapotranspiration of natural water according to the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration it is a drought and flood evaluation index in the sense of climate and is given as follows 2 c w i p e t 0 where et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm d 1 p is precipitation in addition to climate anthropogenic activities lead to changes in the area of chahannur lake these factors include the agriculture yield changes in gdp irrigated area wells and changes in the depth of the groundwater table these unreasonable anthropogenic activities in the basin may have caused an imbalance in water resources and ecosystems enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model estarfm ndvi data with high spatiotemporal resolution from 2000 to 2017 were initially obtained by the estarfm model and the ndvi time series curve of the crop growth period in the basin was then reconstructed using the hants filter we then extracted the distribution of irrigated cropland and crops from 2000 to 2017 chen et al 2021 and analyzed regional water use in conjunction with groundwater level data from regional observation wells table 2 2 3 3 trend analysis approach we calculated the interannual variation trend of ndvi in each grid by the mann kendall test which is a non parametric statistical method for analyzing the changing trend of elements with time series the advantage of this method is that the data don t need to ensure the normal distribution and affected outliers it is convenient to calculate and has a wide range of applications stoimenova 2010 suppose there are n samples x 1 x 2 x n the statistics of m k test for time series x are as follows 3 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where sgn is a symbolic function which is defined as follows 4 sgn θ 1 θ 0 0 θ 0 1 θ 0 n 10 s is approximately normal distribution its average value is 0 and the variance v s is 5 v s n n 1 2 n 5 18 6 z s 1 v s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v s s 0 for the given confidence level α if z z 1 α 2 it has an obvious trend change in time series data z 0 indicates that the sequence shows an increasing trend and z 0 indicates that the sequence shows a decreasing trend the 95 confidence is used as the minimum standard to judge whether there is a significant trend change z 1 96 2 3 4 granger causality tests and convergent cross mapping to determine the causal relationship between climate change and human activities and lake area analyses were carried out using gc and ccm tests considering the seasonal variation in the lake area chose the monthly scale climatic factors which include precipitation temperature and climatic wetness indices however the temporal resolution of irrigated land agricultural production gdp and groundwater are annual so we chose monthly et corresponding to irrigated land as an anthropogenic factor granger causality tests gc explain that the change of a variable is affected by the past behavior of itself and other variables granger 1969 when the two variables have a lag relationship in time series we can statistically investigate whether the relationship is unilateral or mutual fornarelli et al 2013 consider two random processes x t and y t assuming that they are jointly stationary and that each process has an autoregressive representation then it is completed by the constrained f test and the formula is as follows 7 y t i 1 m α i x t i i 1 m β i y t i μ 1 t 8 h 0 α 1 α 2 α m 0 h 0 is the original hypothesis of the gc test if h 0 α 1 α 2 α m 0 x does not the granger cause y if h 0 α 1 α 2 α m 0 x does the granger cause y additionally the gc test has lag characteristics akaike info criterion aic and schwaiz criterion sc were used to evaluate the optimal lag order and the optimal lag order corresponds to the minimum value of aic and sc the precondition of gc tests is that the cause must occur before the result for some without logical relationship variables is full of limitations to obtain the causal relationship between variables with weak coupling sugihara et al 2012 proposed a method called convergent cross mapping ccm to analyze the causal relationship between variables of nonlinear systems with weak to medium coupling strength it judged the causal relationship by whether the historical information can accurately estimate the degree of the trigger vatable according to the embedding theorem of takens

results 3 1 regional ecological environment 3 1 1 change in the chahannur lake area we extracted the area of chahannur lake in the growing season of the crop april to october using remote sensing data since 1991 the trend is shown in fig 4 where water existed until 2000 the maximum water surface area reached as much as 90 km2 between 1994 and 1995 after which the lake area decreased rapidly at a rate of 0 013 km2 a and turned into a seasonal lake in 2000 the largest area of the lake decreased from 76 23 km2 in 1991 17 44 km2 in 2000 the area of chahannur lake fluctuated widely but there were no obvious changes in trends only a certain extent of water surface was recovered in the summer of rainy years the maximum area of water surface reached 30 km2 from 2003 to 2004 but it dried for the subsequent 7 years from 2010 2014 precipitation showed an increasing trend again simultaneously the lake surface also began to recover up to nearly 40 km2 since 2015 chahannur lake dried for the second time and go on until nowadays 3 1 2 change of vegetation index in the basin in the last 20 years the average and maximum values of the vegetation index both showed an increasing trend and this has been more significant since 2009 fig 5a the vegetation declined gradually and the average and maximum values decreased from 0 29 and 0 48 in 2000 0 23 and 0 32 in 2009 respectively subsequently it gradually recovered from 2009 to 2019 and became stable after 2018 according to previous studies zhang et al 2017 su et al 2018 precipitation has a positive effect on ndvi changes precipitation in the study area decreased significantly from 2000 to 2008 which inhibited the increase in vegetation cover while it increased continuously after 2008 which promoted an increase in ndvi the spatial distribution of the ndvi change trend in the study area was divided into five types by using the mann kendall trend test these included an extremely significant decrease significant decrease insignificant change a significant increase and an extremely significant increase since 2000 the spatial distribution including the extremely significant increase in vegetation has been consistent with the emergence of irrigated cultivated land the higher altitude areas in the northwest show obvious vegetation degradation but vegetation in the southeast increases significantly fig 5b this indicates that the expansion of irrigation activities significantly improves the biomass of irrigated farmland in the basin and drives the average vegetation coverage however irrigation and other human activities cause a decline in the groundwater table and the water in the high lying areas cannot supplement the needs for vegetation growth over time the natural grassland showed a trend of degradation which further shows that human activities have a greater effect on the vegetation coverage in this area 3 2 change of climate factors and their impact on the lake area 3 2 1 meteorological factors we chose the annual average meteorological variables including precipitation temperature and climate wetness index to analyze the relationship between meteorological factors and the lake area based on the data from the meteorological stations around chahannur lake over the past 40 years overall the climate change shows a trend of warming and humidification the precipitation in the five counties showed a stable increasing trend except for shangdu county fig 6a1 b1 c1 d1 e1 f1 the average increase rate was only 0 824 mm a but became 9 55 mm a in the last 10 years the maximum precipitation in 2018 and the minimum precipitation in 2009 were 451 mm and 237 mm respectively the increases in the annual average temperature at the six stations averaged 0 042 c a which is consistent with climate warming fig 6a2 b2 c2 d2 e2 and f2 the wetness index p et0 showed a consistent increase of 0 07 a in recent years in shangdu and xinghe fig 6a3 b3 except for the kangbao station fig 6c3 which remained unchanged the p et0 of other stations fig 6d3 e3 and f3 showed an increasing trend indicating that the climate in the region has entirely become wetter since 2005 and is beneficial to the increases in runoff and lake surface area 3 2 2 change in rainfall patterns the rainfall was divided into three types after further analysis according to the standard of the china meteorological administration light rain daily precipitation 10 mm moderate rain 10 mm daily precipitation 25 mm and heavy rain 25 mm daily precipitation 50 mm we found that the light rain in the study area has almost no change at all except for a slight decrease in the last 10 years the change rates of light rain in the shangdu and shangyi both were 0 03 mm a which are more significant than those at other stations fig 7a d g j m p the changes in moderate rain are opposite to those of light rain all the stations showed an increasing trend for nearly ten years fig 7b e h n except for shangyi fig 7k and kangbao fig 7q decreased from 2016 the change in heavy rain was not obvious but shangyi county near chahannur lake had a gradient ascent in the last 10 years with the temperature rise the climate wetness index has made the basin relatively warm and humid compared to that during 1980 2009 the results also indicate that climate change in the basin positively influences the increase in the lake area 3 2 3 influence of climatic factors climate change is a key factor in the increase and decrease of lake areas only when excluding human activities many studies dan 2019 bai 2016 wang et al 2022 have argued that the lake groups in inner mongolia have shrunk due to the integrated roles of decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature conversely the lake area can recover with increasing precipitation and climate wetness index by analyzing the changes of the lake area precipitation and frequency of heavy rain we found that the degree of the lake drying in the second disappearance period 2015 2019 of the lake surface was much greater than that in the first 2006 2009 fig 8 however the precipitation showed an insignificant decreasing trend over the past 40 years and the precipitation in the second disappearance period was higher than that in the first it is even beneficial as it increases the water surface therefore we included the causes of the differences between the two disappearance periods as the continuous increase in irrigated farmland leads to serious surface and underground water scarcity lacking runoff and groundwater recharge in rivers and lakes the water body did not recover even though the precipitation increased significantly the deterioration of the ecological environment caused by the destruction of the surface environment is irreversible therefore human activities need to be considered as influencing factors for further analyses 3 3 impacts of human activities on the lake area 3 3 1 temporal and spatial variation of agricultural land cover in the basin the temporal and spatial distributions of irrigated cultivated land from 2000 to 2017 were extracted by cart classification and the spatial distribution is shown in fig 9 the high terrain in the north of the basin makes it difficult to extract groundwater and there are few irrigated lands the rain fed land is also significantly reduced owing to the lack of sufficient water supply leaving only the irrigated land dominated by sunflowers sugar beets and potatoes in the gully area the irrigation land in the southeast is densely distributed which is the breeding and planting area of vegetables sunflowers sugar beets and potatoes the distribution of irrigated land is concentrated close to the central part of chahannur lake owing to adequate water extraction statistics show that irrigated land has increased gradually and rain fed land has decreased every year in 2000 the rain fed farmland in the chahannur lake basin was 263 83 103 ha and only 152 91 103 ha of land comprised the irrigated farmland which was mainly distributed around chahannur lake since the implementation of the grain for green project of china in 1999 the planting structure in this area has been readjusted and its pillar industry has gradually changed from dry farming to an irrigation based vegetable industry the total area of cropland increased from 352 12 103 ha in 2000 397 12 103 ha in 2008 with the continuous development of the vegetable basket project in the bashang plateau area of hebei province the planting scale of vegetables has gradually expanded vegetable planting bases were established by considering daqinggou and qijia towns of shangyi county as examples cultivated land was constantly being reclaimed by local farmers and irrigation devices were installed although agricultural production was developing it destroyed the water resources sustainability of the basin the final irrigated land increased to 254 24 103 ha and the rain fed land was reduced to 142 88 103 ha by 2017 the total area of cultivated land in the basin was 334 93 103 ha indicating a decrease of 62 19 103 ha compared to the 2008 level the area of irrigated cultivated land was distributed throughout the basin and it was reduced to 192 09 103 ha while only some grain products such as wheat naked oats and flax were planted in the rain fed land which remained unchanged at 142 84 103 ha chen et al 2021 additionally the primary industry and yield of major crops in the basin increased by 245 and 402 respectively from 2000 to 2018 fig 10 3 3 2 change in groundwater in the basin the middle and lower areas are the most important agricultural production regions in the chahannur basin owing to the dry climate and lack of rain irrigation has become the main agricultural activity to increase crop yield water resources are a massive extraction and unreasonable use has inevitably led to a serious decline in groundwater according to the investigation results of the geological survey bureau the annual average total water resources of the chahannur basin was 153 10 108 million m3 including 39 68 102 million m3 of surface water resources 127 72 102 million m3 of groundwater resources and 66 55 102 million m3 of exploitable groundwater resources table 3 however the changes in surface water groundwater and total resources decreased by 72 24 and 33 respectively from the second water resource assessment in 1995 2000 to the third one in 2001 2016 the results of the water resources bulletin of inner mongolia also showed that the total water supply in 2019 was 79 93 million m3 which increased by 20 00 million m3 compared to 2000 subsequently we divided the total water supply by water derived as groundwater supply wherein 75 87 million m3 accounted for 94 9 and the recycled supply after sewage treatment 40 60 million m3 accounted for 5 1 according to the ways of water consumption the agricultural water uses were 62 24 million m3 which accounted for 80 4 of the total water consumption the domestic water was 9 80 million m3 which accounted for 12 2 of the total water consumption the industrial and urban ecological water usages were 4 24 million m3 and 1 65 million m3 which accounted for 5 3 and 2 1 respectively through the statistical analysis the degree of water resource exploitation and utilization was approximately 90 the ecological fragility and arid climate have restricted the economic development of the basin to develop irrigated agriculture and improve land use efficiency drilling wells have become a popular agricultural method in the basin since 2000 considering inner mongolia and hebei province as examples by coordinating and calculating the datum of the statistical yearbook of the aforementioned two provinces we confirmed that there were 5162 wells in the inner mongolia part of the basin there was an increase in 1966 compared with the year 2000 among which 4159 wells were in shangdu county 871 in xinghe county 127 in huade county and 5 in chayouqian banner the number of wells in the northern hebei mountainous area increased from 888 in 2000 3150 in 2017 which was an increase of 254 this phenomenon led to the large scale exploitation of water resources and the continuous decline in water levels in the basin in 2000 the buried depth of groundwater in the basin was generally shallow and only a few scattered groundwater table depths exceeded 5 m additionally numerous groundwater over exploitation areas have not appeared and the average buried depth of groundwater was 3 74 m the groundwater table depth around chahannur lake is less than 3 m which is close to nature as the irrigated area increased the amount of groundwater exploitation increased in 2018 the groundwater was 12 67 m with an average drop of 8 93 m from 2000 fig 11 the aforementioned buried depth data of the groundwater area were obtained from the geological survey bureau 3 4 analysis of gc and ccm causality tests in conducting the granger test the adf unit root test is first required for all time series of each influence factor and the null hypothesis of the existence of a unit root p 0 05 is rejected for all tests so all time series are smooth time series then the appropriate lag order for each pair of causality tests was determined as a way to improve the fit the final results are shown in table 4 the p value of precipitation and cwi does not granger cause area is less than 0 05 which means the precipitation and cwi is the granger cause of lake area the result of temperature explained that it does not the cause of lake area the p value of et does not granger cause area is smaller than the test for lake area on et therefore et is considered to be a factor of the lake area results of all factor tests found that seasonal climatic factors have a greater impact on the lake area than inter annual variation thus both climatic factors and et correspond to monthly variations in the lake area the convergent cross mapping should first determine the optimal embedding dimension e the optimal embedding dimension e of the climatic factor time series chosen is 10 and the embedding dimension of the human activity et is 3 the results show that precipitation and temperature are the causes of lake area while the climate wetness index belongs to the normalized sample and has a different order of magnitude from the lake area leading to the error of ccm analysis results in addition fig 12d shows that et is the cause of lake area the combined gc and ccm causality tests demonstrate that the lake area is most influenced by precipitation but with the intensification of human activities surface and groundwater are continuously exploited for agricultural irrigation and precipitation increases but is not sufficient to recharge runoff and surface water and the lake area gradually shrinks or even difficult to recover 4 discussion chahannur lake an inland lake in the agro pastoral ecotone of china is an important water resource although previous studies have analyzed lake changes in arid and semi arid regions those have seldom detected the period when it became a seasonal lake additionally current domestic and foreign scholars have evaluated the evolution trend and driving factors of the lake area and water level in different regions zhang et al 2017 jing et al 2019 international studies about lake research mostly focus on the analysis of climate change thakuri et al 2016 and the impacting factors of human activities are not comprehensively considered in terms of the time series it is difficult to obtain long term continuous series of remote sensing image data therefore most studies used intermittent remote sensing data to analyze the dynamic changes in different lake areas and there was a lack of continuous monitoring cai et al 2016 this study qualitatively analyzes the impact of driving forces including climate and anthropogenic factors on changes in the lake more quantitative works were required in the future especially regarding the effects of different rain on the temporary water surface increase and multi year scale change the establishment of the model can not only quantify the contribution rate of influencing factors to lake change but also analyze the internal relationship of each influencing factor jepsen et al 2013 we found the inflow source and amount of the lake subtracted its expenditure and waste and established a suitable model for water balance in the study area quinton et al 2009 cheng et al 2017 depicted that heavy rainfall will produce a certain amount of recharge under arid and semi arid conditions by using observation data this is similar to the results of our results wherein the increase in the water area was related to runoff which was produced by increases in the climate wetness index and heavy rain however the actual runoff change in the basin did not achieve the expected results and the lake area gradually shrank the climate in this basin has been warm and humid in the past 40 years which was conducive to increasing the area of the lake however the lake has been shrinking to a seasonal lake which is mainly influenced by human activities additionally most of the traditional rain fed agriculture in the chahannur lake basin has been replaced by irrigated agriculture implying that the demand for water resources is bound to increase sharply in most arid areas the counties pursue crop yield making irrigated land a popular agricultural method and planting some high water consuming crops to ensure their products and export rakhmatullaev et al 2010 2011 li and tao 2009 conducted a detailed study on the vegetable industry and water resources in the bashang plateau and believed that the development of the vegetable industry caused not only a serious drop in the groundwater table and continued shrinkage of surface water but also the subsequent desertification of the area therefore it is necessary to adjust the planting structure based on water saving irrigation due to the lack of hydrological stations in chahannur lake basin and inability to obtain observation data such as runoff and water table this study lacks quantitative analysis therefore the paper performed the gc and ccm to improve the robustness of methodology and results gc test can play a powerful role in pure random or linear systems with satisfied separability and gaussian distribution fornarelli et al 2013 bressler and seth 2011 however when two variables are affected by a common factor at the same time how to distinguish the causality and correlation of the two variables is limited sugihara et al 2012 ccm with convergence characteristics cannot substitute gc but a supplement for it that is the larger causal variable sample is the smaller the ccm estimation error will be ma et al 2014 its advantages are distinguishing the time lag of causal influence eliminating the impact of confounding factors and making up short term order clear et al 2015 however one of the defects of ccm is that when reason x has a strong impact on result although x and y are single causalities ccm often mistakenly considered that there is a bilateral causality so we concluded that ccm cannot distinguish between bilateral causality and strong single causality ye et al 2015 results of ccm detected the precipitation temperature cwi and et and lake area are mutually causal but the former has a greater impact among them precipitation played an increasingly important role in the recovery of lakes especially in the semi arid inland lake with precipitation as the main input source zhou et al 2019 nevertheless with the mismatched spatial distribution of land and water resources and high intensity human activities water scarcity crisis has occurred in arid and semi arid areas chen et al 2018 this phenomenon also reflected the interannual fluctuation of lake area was affected by precipitation whereas the shrinkage of lakes was dominated by increasing water consumption of land surface wang et al 2022 chahannur lake basin is one of the most essential habitats for species such as migratory waterfowl in arid and semi arid areas and decreases in lake volume lead to reductions in species diversity intensified desertification and serious ecological crisis ramsar 2008 owing to a lack of water supply the natural vegetation showed continuous degradation which accelerated the process of land desertification however chahannur lake basin is an ecological barrier and vegetable supply source for beijing and balancing the transformation of ecological value and economic value is a serious question additionally the situation of water resource utilization in the bashang area was evaluated by researchers the statistics showed that the groundwater table depth in the bashang area gradually dropped from 3 to 15 17 m during 1990 s 2005 land surface water also drastically reduced during the same period the number of lakes decreased by 205 the area decreased by 99 88 km2 and the water storage capacity of lakes decreased by 119 million m3 han 2011 based on the above discussions the standardization of agricultural irrigation projects the institutionalization of well drilling water projects and the reasonable arrangement of water fees should be implemented by the government 5 conclusions based on remote sensing data we revealed the temporal and spatial changes in the area of chahannur lake from 1991 to 2019 r2 reached 0 94 by the verification of 53 landsat extracted results during the same period we then analyzed the driving forces of the lake area shrinkage by natural factors including the annual precipitation average annual temperature climate wetness index and anthropogenic activities dominated by irrigated land agricultural yield gdp groundwater table depth and et the conclusions are as follows the area of the chahannur lake water surface decreased from 76 23 km2 in 1991 4 06 km2 in 2019 and became a seasonal lake in 2000 the degree of drying up in the second disappearance period of the lake surface was much greater than that in the first disappearance period the natural vegetation has been replaced by artificial vegetation the spatial distribution of the ndvi change trend showed that the increase in regional vegetation mainly occurred in irrigated areas while northern mountainous areas showed obvious vegetation degradation the climate tends to be warm and humid throughout the entire basin over the past 40 years irrigated land increased annually and the number of groundwater wells increased by 2 55 the average groundwater table depth decreased by 8 93 m in nearly 20 years the results of the granger causality test and ccm showed that both precipitation and et are main factors of the increase of the lake area but the increase of precipitation did not lead to an increase of lake area therefore the reduction in groundwater caused by irrigation pumping is a more dominant factor than precipitation credit authorship contribution statement xiaolu chen conceptualization investigation calculation writing original draft preparation

7971,flooding increases in recent years in particular for coastal communities facing sea level rise have brought renewed attention to real time street scale flood forecasting such flood models using conventional physics based modeling approaches are often unrealistic for real time decision support use cases due to their long model runtime machine learning offers an alternative strategy whereby a surrogate model can be trained to mimic relationships present within the physics based model and after training can run in seconds rather than hours this study used the random forest rf algorithm to emulate a 1d 2d physics based model simulating surface water depths in an urban coastal watershed in norfolk virginia environmental features from a selected set of pluvial and tidal flood events and topographic information of the roadway were the input variables to train the surrogate model results show the potential for the surrogate model to predict flood extent and depth for both pluvial and tidal flood events furthermore the surrogate model can differentiate between flooding locations dominated by pluvial or tidal flooding or impacted by both flooding mechanisms flood reports from the mobile app waze were used for model validation and show 90 agreement with flooding locations from the surrogate model finally feature importance methods were investigated to interpret the performance of the rf models and understand the contribution of different physical features to localized flooding keywords coastal flooding machine learning surrogate modeling flood modeling data availability the script for random forest model and corresponding inputs and outputs are available on hydroshare zahura 2021 1 introduction the projected global increase in sea level rise slr and heavy rainfall threatens to increase the frequency and severity of coastal flooding worldwide church et al 2013 usgcrp 2017 while most past studies estimating the impacts of slr focused on rarely occurring extreme events hallegatte et al 2013 hinkel et al 2014 hsiang et al 2017 the impacts of seemingly less threatening high tide flooding have been highlighted in recent studies high tide flooding also known as nuisance flooding has increased 5 to 10 fold since 1960 and will continue to increase with slr projections dahl et al 2017 moftakhari et al 2015 sweet et al 2018 usgcrp 2017 although short duration nuisance flooding is less destructive on a per event basis it can disrupt the transportation systems multiple times annually jacobs et al 2018 and negatively impacts the local economy hino et al 2019 in coastal cities high tide levels compromise the sewer system by inundating the outlets and often flowing backward to inland areas sadler et al 2020 shen et al 2019 the joint occurrence of rainfall and high tide can worsen the impact of nuisance flooding events lian et al 2015 shen et al 2019 therefore real time flood forecasting at the street scale is needed for early flood warning systems and flood risk management henonin et al 2013 the use of physics based 1d 2d dual drainage models is a traditional approach for simulating the depth and extent of surface flooding in urban areas kourtis et al 2017 these models simulate flow through sewer river systems and overland flow by coupling 1d and 2d hydrodynamic models fan et al 2017 lin et al 2006 seyoum et al 2012 many software packages such as hec ras 2d mike flood sobek deltares 2018 or tuflow bmt wbm 2016 are commercially available to facilitate 1d 2d flood simulation in urban scenarios although this approach can simulate realistic urban flooding with high resolution and accuracy the associated computational time can limit the application for early flood warning systems lhomme et al 2006 tanaka et al 2011 while the advancement in graphical processing unit gpu based parallel computing has sped up the execution of these 2d shallow water equation models for flood simulation high resolution real time flood forecasting is still challenging guo et al 2020 to enable real time flood forecasting recent studies have used response surface surrogates or metamodels box and wilson 1951 razavi et al 2012 simpson et al 2001 zhang et al 2018 where machine learning ml acts as a surrogate to emulate complex high fidelity physics based models berkhahn et al 2019 contreras et al 2020 these models are similar to the digital twin approach which is popular in manufacturing systems and building information modeling lu et al 2019 schleich et al 2017 and is beginning to be applied in water resources bartos and kerkez 2021 inan et al 2021 in this approach a database is generated with several explanatory variables and simulation outputs from a physics based model to train the surrogate model the surrogate model learns from the input output relationship rather than simulating complex physical processes to emulate the physics based model generated outputs after training the surrogate model is validated on independent data and then can make predictions on provided new input data with predictions made in seconds rather than the hours required by the original physics based model berkhahn et al 2019 zahura et al 2020 response surface surrogate models for real time flood forecasting applications have been used by several studies to predict flood depths volume and velocity bass and bedient 2018 bermúdez et al 2019 2018 chang et al 2010 contreras et al 2020 jhong et al 2017 liu and pender 2015 löwe et al 2021 most past studies have explored the ability of surrogate models in approximating pluvial and fluvial flood events or extreme typhoon events however the past studies have not emphasized relatively frequent nuisance flooding events due to high tide and rainfall in an urban coastal environment only two studies used tidal data as inputs for pluvial flood prediction bermúdez et al 2019 zahura et al 2020 none of the past studies investigated the potential of ml surrogates to predict flooding due to high tide or the combined occurrence of rainfall and high tide in coastal cities given that tidal flooding has increased in us coastal cities with cumulative impacts surpassing the impacts of rare extreme events moftakhari et al 2018 a real time flood forecasting model predicting not only flooding from extreme events but also nuisance flooding in coastal cities is urgently needed additionally most of the prior studies ignored topographic data in training the surrogate models some past studies used reference points to make flood predictions followed by interpolation based on the topology only studies by löwe et al 2021 and zahura et al 2020 used topographic information from urban settings in model training and found them essential in emulating pluvial flood depths the capability of the ml surrogates in approximating different flood dynamics based on topography is yet to be investigated to address the existing knowledge gaps this study builds on the work done by zahura et al 2020 to create a response surface surrogate model that emulates pluvial and tidal flooding simulated by a coupled 1d 2d hydrodynamic model tuflow calibrated and validated for the coastal city norfolk virginia usa an ml algorithm random forest rf was trained using two types of input features i roadway topography and ii environmental information for selected flood events while the output was tuflow simulated hourly water depths on the roadways in the study domain the rf surrogate s performance in predicting both pluvial and tidal flooding was evaluated for two different training approaches i training with only pluvial and no tidal events and ii training with both pluvial and tidal events these two training approaches were compared to evaluate the value of including tidal flooding explicitly within the training data sixteen rainfall dominant and eight tide dominant events were used for this purpose the surrogate models were tested on four rainfall and two high tide dominant events independent of the training events the physics based and surrogate models were validated using crowdsourced flood reports from the mobile app waze to build trust in the model predicted flooding the surrogate model s potential to differentiate between tidal dominate and rainfall dominate flooding while making predictions was also investigated as were approaches for gaining insight and interpretability of the rf model output overall this study advances the potential for creating surrogate ml flood models for real time street scale decision support that can capture combined pluvial and tidal flooding in coastal urban environments 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the city of norfolk virginia fig 1 located along the us east coast is one of the most vulnerable coastal cities to slr fears 2012 this coastal city and the surrounding hampton roads region are experiencing two times faster local slr than the global slr due to land subsidence and ocean circulation dynamics atkinson et al 2013 the frequency of nuisance flooding in norfolk has increased by 325 since 1960 burgos et al 2018 this increased flood frequency threatens the city which is home to 244 000 people and vital for the us economy and national security the city of norfolk is actively adapting coastal resilience strategies to become resilient to extreme events 2 2 environmental data the surrogate model required environmental data such as rainfall and tide level observations as inputs to predict water depths on streets based on characteristics of the given events these data were collected from hampton roads sanitation district hrsd and u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa stations from jan 1 2016 to dec 31 2018 ten hrsd rainfall stations were used to collect 15 minute rainfall observations daily rainfall and hourly tide level observations referenced to the north american vertical datum navd88 were collected from noaa s norfolk international airport noaa 2018a and sewells point station noaa 2018b respectively 2 3 topographic and roadway data topographic data were required as model input to distinguish between the topographic characteristics of the roadways causing flooding and validate the models with crowdsourced data from the u s geological survey usgs a digital elevation model dem with 1 m resolution usgs 2016 and lidar light detection and ranging point cloud data usgs 2013 for norfolk were collected a shapefile of norfolk street centerlines was collected through the city s official website city of norfolk gis bureau 2018 2 4 crowdsourced street scale flood data crowdsourced flood reports were collected from two sources the city of norfolk s system to track organize record and map storm sep 2010 dec 2019 and waze aug 2017 dec 2019 the city uses storm to record the impacts from storms including the coordinates of flooded locations reported by the city workers at a daily timescale waze owned by google is a gps navigation app that provides real time traffic updates and allows riders to report live updates on the street condition such as accidents flooded streets etc the exact time and coordinates of reported flooding were collected from waze the four locations with maximum reported flooding were identified using both storm and waze reports fig 1 flood reports around these locations mainly occurred during high tide s1 in fig 1 during both high tide and rainfall s2 in fig 1 and during rainfall events s3 and s4 in fig 1 as waze provided more extensive and diverse flood data with exact reporting time than storm it was used for model validation 2 5 simulated street scale flood depth data a 1d 2d dual drainage model tuflow built for a large area in norfolk by shen et al 2019 was used to simulate street level flood depth and generate output to train the surrogate model tuflow links 1d pipe flow solved using estry to 2d surface flow solved using 2d shallow water equations the urban flood model covered an area of 56 4 km2 in norfolk the pluvial flooding inside this area was generated internally as no rainfall generated flow from the surrounding basins entered the study domain the tide level at the outlet was considered the same as sewells point station which is the closest tide gauge to the study area this model required rainfall and tide level to simulate detailed surface flooding maps for every hour of the event at a spatial resolution of 5 m which was used to build the surrogate model 3 methodology 3 1 model data preprocessing four environmental and three topographic features were generated from the raw environmental and topographic data respectively table 1 the 15 min interval rainfall data from hrsd were aggregated to produce three rainfall features hourly rainfall to describe the rainfall during the hour of interest cumulative rainfall in the last 2 hr and cumulative rainfall in the last 72 h to describe antecedent soil moisture conditions or exceedance of stormwater system capacity from the past occurrences of rainfall due to the spatial variability of rainfall among stations rainfall features were interpolated across the study domain using inverse distance weighted interpolation as tide level is one of the dominant factors for flooding in coastal cities hourly tide level was used as an input feature the three topographic features derived from 1 m dem were elevation topographic wetness index twi and depth to water dtw elevation was used to describe the variation of street elevations within the study domain twi explains the likelihood of an area accumulating surface runoff based on local topography with higher twi indicating a higher tendency for runoff accumulation twi is defined as 1 twi ln α tan β where α contributing area per unit contour length and tan β local slope beven and kirkby 1979 dtw measures the soil moisture condition murphy et al 2007 for i a pixel on the landscape as 2 dtw dz i dx i a x c where dz i dx i sum of slopes across the least slope path from i to the closest pixel of waterbodies a 1 or 2 based on whether the pixel boundary is crossed parallelly or diagonally by the path and x c pixel resolution the lower value of dtw indicates the pixel on the landscape is closer to waterbodies in terms of both vertical and horizontal distance therefore wetter soil the input file for the surrogate model was prepared by extracting the input features for the streets within the study domain regarding the restriction of vehicular movement on a road during flood events we assumed that the deepest flood depth along a street would be sufficient for road closure decisions therefore the street centerline shapefile for norfolk was divided into segments with 50 m length due to lack of road width data we assumed the roads consisted of two lanes each 3 6 m wide the average lane width in the us us department of transportation 2014 the arcgis software system esri 2020 was implemented to prepare a shapefile of street segments where each segment was 50 m long and 7 2 m wide this shapefile was used to extract the mean and maximum of the input features and tuflow simulated hourly water depths respectively at each segment the information on pump stations operational at the underpasses in norfolk was unavailable to be incorporated in the tuflow model therefore the street segments representing underpasses were excluded from the analysis resulting in 16 914 segments to develop the surrogate model 3 2 training and testing data the rf surrogate models were developed using training data containing only rainfall events rf p and both rainfall and high tide events rf p t the daily rainfall data and higher high tide data collected from noaa were used to select the top 20 daily rainfall events table 2a and the top 10 high tide events table 2b these events were divided into training and testing with an 80 20 split agranoff et al 2006 with 16 rainfall events in training for rf p and 16 rainfall and 8 tide events in training for rf p t the number of hours for the rainfall and tidal training events were 375 and 282 respectively in our previous study we found that oversampling the minority class with flood depths 0 3 m and maintaining a one to one ratio between minority and majority depth 0 3 m groups improved predictive performance zahura et al 2020 using a 1 1 ratio between these groups resulted in training samples with 12 227 103 rows and 7 columns and 21 754 398 rows and 7 columns for rf p and rf p t respectively the predictive capability of both models was tested on four rainfall and two tide events test events were chosen based on the availability of waze data the chosen rainfall events for testing had a wide variety of storm events while testing high tide events were selected to represent tide events with considerable and minor occurrence of rainfall 3 3 ml algorithm rf regressor rf was used in this study because it is faster to tune and train than the other ml methods and preprocessing inputs to improve predictive accuracy is generally not needed ahmad et al 2017 the rf regressor used in this study is an ensemble ml algorithm that uses many decorrelated regression trees to make predictions breiman 2001 breiman et al 1984 tree based approaches tend to overfit to the training data random forest solves this problem by creating a collection of multiple trees where each tree learns from randomly chosen samples and input features and predictions are made by averaging the predictions from each tree additionally the overfitting problem can be solved by not using fully grown trees in the forest or pruning the trees this can be done by controlling the maximum depth of trees and the minimum number of samples required for splitting in addition to making predictions rf also provides an overall interpretation of feature importance known as gini importance by measuring the total decrease in mean squared error by each feature the rf regression was performed using sklearn ensemble randomforestregressor from python scikit learn module pedregosa et al 2011 scikit learn developers 2018 the rf regressor was optimized by tuning hyperparameters number of trees n estimators number of input features at each split max features and the maximum depth of a tree max depth the function gridsearchcv in the scikit learn module can find the optimal values of model hyperparameters by iterating all combinations of predefined hyperparameter values using k fold cross validation using the training data this function was applied to tune n estimators max features and max depth table 3 with 4 fold cross validation and the best values were 50 5 and none respectively however with max depth none there was minimal improvement in the average accuracy from cross validation for n estimators above 30 fig 2 a similarly with n estimators 30 increasing max depth beyond 40 caused little improvement in accuracy fig 2 b as the best values of max depth and n estimators did not improve model performance significantly and increased run time by consuming up to 97 computer memory 40 and 30 were set as the parameter values respectively a sample weight of 2 was assigned for samples with water depths 0 2 m to maximize the predictive performance while fitting the rf models 3 4 model evaluation the surrogate models accuracy and bias towards overprediction or underprediction in emulating tuflow simulated time series water depths on streets during the flood events were evaluated using root mean squared error rmse and mean error me for each street segment as 3 r m s e s m y t u f l o w s h y r f s h 2 n 4 me s m y tuflow s h y rf s h n where ytuflow and yrf were tuflow simulated and rf predicted water depth respectively on a street segment s during an hour h n represented the total number of hours with rainfall 0 mm or tide level 0 8 m from navd or tuflow simulated flood depths above 0 1 m during the events according to noaa a tide level above 0 845 m from navd is the threshold for minor flooding in norfolk sweet et al 2018 and flooding can occur below this threshold burgos et al 2018 therefore a tide level of 0 8 m above navd was used to identify flood depth relevant to tidal flooding the spatial performance of the surrogate models in mapping the maximum inundation extent and magnitude was evaluated for threshold depths 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m the inundation extent was defined with a wet dry threshold of 0 1 m bermúdez et al 2019 shen et al 2019 limiting high velocity water depth on streets shand et al 2011 thresholds of 0 2 and 0 3 m were used to identify different flood intensities as the air inlet height of passenger vehicles ranges within 0 25 0 35 m a street becomes impassable at 0 3 m of water depth ausroads 2008 yin et al 2016 also 0 3 m water depth can wash away cars and should be closed to ensure safety noaa national weather service 2018 therefore replicating the extent of such streets was important three performance metrics precision recall and f1 scores were used to evaluate rf s potential in emulating spatial flood patterns recall representing the percentage of tuflow simulated flooded streets emulated correctly by rf is calculated as 5 recall rf predicted true flooded streets total tuflow simulated flooded streets precision represents the percentage of correct rf predicted flooded streets and calculated as 6 precision rf predicted true flooded streets total rf predicted flooded streets both precision and recall values range between 0 and 1 lower recall and precision indicate underprediction and overprediction of flooding respectively compared to tuflow simulations higher values of these metrics are important for prompt action in hazardous locations and avoiding unnecessary actions in less threatening areas f1 score the harmonic mean of precision and recall is calculated as 7 f 1 score 2 precision recall precision recall the f1 score can reach a maximum value of 1 when both recall and precision are 1 indicating rf predicted and tuflow simulated inundation extents matched perfectly the sklearn metrics module in python scikit learn developers 2018 was used to calculate the performance measures 3 5 crowdsourced data processing and model validation flood reports from waze were used to validate the location and time of flood occurrences during the six test events waze data provide binary yes or no values rather than the flood depth to identify the flooded locations surrounding waze flood reports the viewshed tool on arcgis was implemented this tool determines locations on a raster surface visible from the observer location which is the location of waze reports in this study lidar point cloud data for norfolk were utilized to produce a dem raster the lidar point cloud data contain tree canopy heights over streets resulting in a higher elevation in the lidar derived dem than the street elevation and interfered with viewshed analysis at these locations elevation from lidar derived dem was substituted with street elevation from bare earth dem to obtain continuous viewshed street segments with 50 area covered by viewshed were used to extract the maximum water depth from tuflow and rf during the flood events the performance of the models was analyzed using hit rate h which describes the proportion of waze reported flood locations identified with 0 10 m of water depth by the models defined as 8 h hits hits misses where hits and misses indicated a flood report from waze with 0 10 m and 0 10 m of water depth respectively within its viewshed from the flood models the time difference between waze reports and peak flood depths was also evaluated 4 results and discussion 4 1 approximating flood depth comparison between tuflow simulated and rf p and rf p t predicted water depths on the four highest reported flooded streets during the pluvial and tidal test events are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively the rmses between tuflow simulated and surrogate model predicted water depths at the four locations and across the study domain are listed in table 4 as flooding on s1 is mostly tide driven the intensity of tuflow simulated flooding on this segment was low during the pluvial events which both surrogate models emulated at s2 and s3 the average difference between the tuflow simulated and rf p predicted peaks on aug 11 2018 and may 6 2018 events were 0 041 and 0 057 m respectively on oct 29 2017 event no flooding was simulated on s2 and s3 the may 28 2018 event had two separate rainfall peaks resulting in two flood peaks simulated by tuflow the first peak was overpredicted on s2 by 0 069 m by rf p and s3 by 0 10 and 0 065 m by rf p and rf p t respectively at s4 as the surrogate models drained out the accumulated water earlier than tuflow this segment had rmse higher than the 90th percentile for the pluvial events however the surrogate models predicted the peak time precisely and the predicted peak depths were close to the tuflow simulated peak and above 0 3 m to cause road closure decision during the pluvial events the predicted time series water depths by rf p and rf p t on the four segments were close and the differences between peak values ranged within 0 0 059 m on nov 8 2017 event tuflow simulation showed increasing flood depths on s1 and s3 during the astronomical high tide periods which receded during low tide rf p underpredicted the first and overpredicted the second peak on both s1 and s2 the differences between maximum depths were 0 23 and 0 13 m on s1 and s2 respectively rf p t predicted the peak depth and time of flooding on both segments accurately with rmse 0 046 and 0 025 m for s1 and s2 respectively as s3 and s4 are prone to rainfall driven flooding no flooding was simulated on these segments while rf p overpredicted the depth on s4 rf p t emulated no flooding on this street on sep 9 2018 event rf p overpredicted the peak depths on s1 with rmse 0 121 m rf p t prediction on s1 showed better agreement with tuflow simulation compared to rf p however rf p t predicted peaks occurred an hour earlier than the tuflow simulated peak resulting in an rmse 0 084 m higher than 90th percentile rmse 0 05 m as s4 experiences rainfall driven flooding two flood peaks with depth 0 1 m appeared in the tuflow simulation during hours with rainfall rather than the high tide period rf p could not identify the separate flood peaks during the rainfall period and predicted water depth ranging within 0 09 0 3 m throughout the day rf p t emulated the two flood peaks on s4 during the rainfall period however the peaks were overpredicted by 0 13 and 0 11 m although rf p predicted the presence of tidal flooding the estimated water depths showed a high deviation from tuflow simulated values on the contrary rf p t predicted flood depths with low errors for both pluvial and tidal events also it differentiated between the locations driven by pluvial and tidal flooding and accurately predicted the time of occurrence the capability of the surrogate models to predict water depths across the street segments was measured using segment wise rmse represented as histograms in fig 5 during aug 11 2018 event with the maximum daily rainfall among the testing events the average and 90th percentile rmse from rf p were the highest among the pluvial events among 16 914 segments 65 and 31 had rmse 0 05 and within 0 05 0 10 m respectively and only 4 had rmse 0 10 m 88 of the segments had rmse 0 05 m on may 6 2018 event with 3 falling above rmse 0 10 m the rest of the two pluvial events had 96 and 1 of the segments with rmses 0 050 and 0 10 m respectively for rf p t having high tide events in training increased rmses during the pluvial events except for aug 11 2018 event however the increase in average and 90th percentile rmses was less than 0 005 and 0 006 m respectively indicating the inclusion of tide events did not significantly affect the performance of rf p t the predictive ability of rf p was worse for the tidal events compared to the pluvial events the 90th percentile rmse on sep 9 2018 0 09 m was higher than aug 11 2018 0 078 m event and on nov 8 2017 event was higher than rmses during the other three pluvial events rf p t showed a significant decrease in rmses during the tidal events on average 92 and 1 segments had rmse 0 05 and 0 10 m respectively from rf p t predictions fig 6 shows the me between the simulated and predicted flooding on each road segment during pluvial and tidal flood events negative values of me indicate the mean water depths were overpredicted whereas positive values indicate underprediction me values for rf p during pluvial events were closer to zero with 1 3 and 2 of segments having me 0 025 and me 0 025 m respectively using rf p t the bias in prediction increased however only 3 and 4 2 of segments had me 0 025 and me 0 025 m respectively rf p showed more bias toward overprediction of mean depth with me 0 025 m for 35 of streets for tidal flood events while 14 5 of the segments had me 0 025 m using rf p t this bias in tidal flood prediction was reduced to me 0 025 m at 5 road segments and me 0 025 m at 9 segments although tide level was one of the input features for rf p there were high discrepancies between predicted and simulated water depth on tidal events while rf p t maintained similar rmses like rf p during pluvial events it improved predictions during high tide events therefore rf p t could serve as a unified flood prediction model as it emulated tuflow simulated flooding with low rmses on most of the segments for both types of flood events 4 2 flood extent mapping the recall precision and f1 scores evaluating the maximum extent of flooding from rf p and rf p t during the flood events for thresholds 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m are listed in table 5 during the pluvial events for threshold 0 1 m defining flood boundary recall scores ranged within 0 83 0 96 indicating rf p emulated above 83 of the flood locations from tuflow simulation precision scores ranged within 0 72 0 92 indicating more than 72 of the predicted flood locations were correct for the pluvial events while precision scores remained consistently high throughout all the threshold values recall values dropped with an increased threshold rf p correctly predicted 55 87 and 50 85 of the flooded streets for 0 2 and 0 3 m thresholds respectively like rmses introducing tidal events in training for rf p t caused minimal alteration in recall and precision scores and the decrease in f1 scores was at most 0 04 for the tidal events with a threshold 0 1 m rf p predicted the extent of flooding less accurately than the pluvial events as reflected by the performance scores for thresholds 0 2 and 0 3 m f1 scores dropped below 0 58 for both tidal events suggesting rf p s poor predictive performance in emulating tidal flooding with high tide events in training for rf p t f1 improved up to 0 80 and 0 84 for events on nov 8 2017 and sep 9 2018 respectively on the nov 8 2017 and sep 9 2018 events rf p t correctly emulated 67 and 93 of the tuflow simulated flood extent and 71 and 78 of the roads unsafe to passenger vehicles respectively this suggested that using tide level as an input feature to develop surrogate flood models in an urban coastal environment was insufficient to correctly emulate the extent of tidal flooding or combined pluvial and tidal flooding training events should have representation from different flood types 4 3 validation using crowdsourced flood report fig 7 and fig 8 demonstrate the rainfall tide level and time of waze reports and the maximum water depth during the events within the viewshed of the waze reports respectively table 6 lists the h values quantifying the agreement between waze reports and flooding from tuflow and rf p t a maximum of 58 flood locations was reported on aug 11 2018 and 93 and 96 6 of the reports had maximum water depth ranging within 0 1 1 m inside viewshed according to tuflow and rf p t respectively the lowest h was found for tuflow on sep 9 2018 event by investigating the streets with base map imagery in arcmap and tuflow simulated water depth it was found that two reports had water depth 0 1 m within viewshed however creating segments with 7 2 m width did not cover the actual road width and missed the corners of the roads where flooding happened decreasing h similarly 1 1 and 3 flood reports on nov 8 2017 may 6 and aug 11 2018 respectively had water depths 0 10 m within viewshed which were missed due to the geometric bias reducing h overall 87 5 and 90 4 of the waze flood reports were associated with water depth 0 10 m from tuflow and rf p t respectively while this agreement validated both models it also suggested that rf p t could predict flood depth on the four highest reported flood locations and other user reported locations across the study domain the minor mismatch between waze and flood models could be resulting from the uncertainty regarding crowdsourced data reliability boutsis et al 2016 as experts do not generate these reports the perception of a flood would widely vary among the users the distance between 95 of the flood reports and the location of maximum flood depth ranged within 0 150 m reports located 150 m from the maximum flood depth had 0 10 m of water depth within 0 47 m on streets fig 9 demonstrates the difference between the time of the waze reports and the peak depths 68 of flood reports appeared within 1 h of the peak depth for all the test events as indicated by the boxplots the reports appearing 3 4 h from the peak depth on oct 29 2017 nov 8 2017 and aug 11 2018 had 0 10 m of water depth during or within 1 h of the reports the may 28 2018 event had two peak rainfalls generating two flood peaks although the maximum flood depth was simulated during the second peak flood reports appeared during the first peak fig 7 with depths ranging between 0 08 and 0 23 m therefore the time difference was calculated between the first peak and the flood reports for this event overall 17 28 and 55 of the reports appeared before during and after the time of peak flood depth respectively 4 4 feature importance rf generated gini importance measures the global importance of each feature for the whole dataset saarela and jauhiainen 2021 among the seven input features rf p found twi to be the most important in predicting street flooding followed by elv and hr 72 fig 10 td hr was the least important feature in rf p which could be due to the lack of representation of tidal flood events in training however rf p t computed importance of td hr dropped by 0 008 and was the least important feature despite tidal flood incidents improving flood prediction the importance of hr 72 increased by 0 10 and was the most important feature calculated by rf p t while the importance of twi dropped while rainfall and tide are the commonly known features for flooding in coastal cities rh and td hr were unimportant according to rf this deviation of feature importance from physical expectations could be due to the bias in gini importance towards variables varying in scale which are artificially preferred during splitting strobl et al 2007 also gini importance fails to find the true predictors when the relationship between predictors and response is weak archer and kimes 2008 correlations between training features and water depths varied between 0 30 and 0 43 rf p t indicating a weak predictor response relationship twi had the highest correlation coefficient 0 452 and 0 436 for rf p and rf p t respectively the second most correlated feature was hr 72 which experienced an increase in correlation coefficient from 0 349 rf p to 0 432 rf p t suggesting that correlation between the features and response might have influenced the global feature importance from rf an alternative approach for determining variable importance for rf is local interpretable model agnostic explanations lime ribeiro et al 2016 we applied lime for s1 and s3 during hours 17 00 and 9 00 for the aug 11 2018 and sep 9 2018 events respectively fig 11 for the aug 11 2018 event elv and rh were the top two features contributing positively towards flood prediction for both segments twi was important for both segments but contributed negatively to s1 and positively for s3 this may be because high twi for s3 caused runoff accumulation during rainfall whereas s1 had low twi and was impacted more by tidal flooding for the event on sep 9 2018 elv and td hr contributed positively to the tuflow simulated 0 499 m depth of water while all the other features had a negative effect in all four examples elv was the most important feature in explaining flood depth prediction while hr 72 was consistently one of the least important features while rh hr 2 and td hr were the least important features according to gini importance they played a crucial role in flood prediction according to the local analysis which is what one might expect given the physical understanding of flood generation therefore we suggest there is more value in analyzing variable importance locally using an approach like lime than global approaches like gini for flood applications 4 5 computational cost the comparison between the computational cost for tuflow and rf is listed in table 7 the computational time for tuflow model execution on cpus would be 120 hr per event morsy et al 2018 tuflow heavily parallelized compute hpc engine allowed simulation on two gpus and reduced execution time to 4 5 6 hr per event training time for rf p trained with 16 events containing 375 hr was 30 min which increased to 56 min for rf p t due to increased training samples 627 hr however the average time predicting each event was 4 5 and 4 2 s for rf p and rf p t respectively thus rf p t could make predictions 3800 times faster than tuflow with reasonable flood depth and extent prediction errors 5 conclusion this study resulted in rf surrogate models for real time street scale forecasting of both pluvial and tidal flooding using the coastal city of norfolk va as a study region responses from a physics based model tuflow were approximated by learning from inputs containing topographic variables for roadways and environmental variables for flood events and the corresponding target variable tuflow simulated water depths two surrogate models were trained with i only pluvial rf p and ii both pluvial and tidal rf p t flood events comparison between these approaches showed that training on pluvial events with the tide as an input inadequately predicted the depth and extent of inundation during high tide or combined rainfall and high tide occurrence in coastal cities the representation of both pluvial and tidal flood events in training significantly improved the predictive performance on test events by predicting 67 95 of the tuflow simulated flood extent with average rmses of water depth ranging within 0 029 0 054 m the predictive capability of the surrogate model for locations not in training was not explored in this study to apply this model in a different urban area may require retraining using corresponding topographic data and physics based model outputs future work should explore the transferability of this ml modeling approach to other urban areas analyzing the locations of waze flood reports showed that 87 5 and 90 4 of the reports had 0 10 m water depth within the reporter s visibility from tuflow simulated and rf p t predicted flooding respectively the distance between the reports and simulated flooding ranged within 0 150 m 68 of the reports were within 1 hr from the time of peak depth the agreement between time and location of flood reports with tuflow simulated and rf p t predicted flooding served as validation for both models the high agreement between the models and the flood reports suggested that the surrogate model could identify problematic flood spots on the roadway network in both space and time to support real time decisions for the locations with disagreement between flood reports and modeled results further work is needed to determine if this was due to errors in the crowdsourced data or errors with the model s predictive skill if the latter it would be interesting and worth determining if the error is in the physics based model itself or the ml surrogate model the rf algorithm can facilitate real time street flood forecasting due to its short runtime while maintaining an acceptable loss of accuracy compared to the high fidelity physics based model tuflow rf p t required 56 mins for training and 4 2 s on average for predicting each test event increasing the computational speed by a factor of 3800 compared to tuflow additionally rf provides global feature importance for the whole dataset which was analyzed to understand the contribution of input features in flood prediction the least important features from rf p t were surprisingly found to be hourly rainfall and tide level which are the main physical drivers of flooding in a coastal city analyzing local feature importance using lime revealed that these two features were significant in flood depth estimation with either positive or negative contribution levels based on the type of flood events thus while the global feature importance provides insight into the rf model s general behavior it can be biased towards the training data and affected by the correlation between inputs and target variable therefore to interpret any black box rf model for flood prediction or to perform feature selection the local contribution of features should be investigated in future studies credit authorship contribution statement faria

7971,flooding increases in recent years in particular for coastal communities facing sea level rise have brought renewed attention to real time street scale flood forecasting such flood models using conventional physics based modeling approaches are often unrealistic for real time decision support use cases due to their long model runtime machine learning offers an alternative strategy whereby a surrogate model can be trained to mimic relationships present within the physics based model and after training can run in seconds rather than hours this study used the random forest rf algorithm to emulate a 1d 2d physics based model simulating surface water depths in an urban coastal watershed in norfolk virginia environmental features from a selected set of pluvial and tidal flood events and topographic information of the roadway were the input variables to train the surrogate model results show the potential for the surrogate model to predict flood extent and depth for both pluvial and tidal flood events furthermore the surrogate model can differentiate between flooding locations dominated by pluvial or tidal flooding or impacted by both flooding mechanisms flood reports from the mobile app waze were used for model validation and show 90 agreement with flooding locations from the surrogate model finally feature importance methods were investigated to interpret the performance of the rf models and understand the contribution of different physical features to localized flooding keywords coastal flooding machine learning surrogate modeling flood modeling data availability the script for random forest model and corresponding inputs and outputs are available on hydroshare zahura 2021 1 introduction the projected global increase in sea level rise slr and heavy rainfall threatens to increase the frequency and severity of coastal flooding worldwide church et al 2013 usgcrp 2017 while most past studies estimating the impacts of slr focused on rarely occurring extreme events hallegatte et al 2013 hinkel et al 2014 hsiang et al 2017 the impacts of seemingly less threatening high tide flooding have been highlighted in recent studies high tide flooding also known as nuisance flooding has increased 5 to 10 fold since 1960 and will continue to increase with slr projections dahl et al 2017 moftakhari et al 2015 sweet et al 2018 usgcrp 2017 although short duration nuisance flooding is less destructive on a per event basis it can disrupt the transportation systems multiple times annually jacobs et al 2018 and negatively impacts the local economy hino et al 2019 in coastal cities high tide levels compromise the sewer system by inundating the outlets and often flowing backward to inland areas sadler et al 2020 shen et al 2019 the joint occurrence of rainfall and high tide can worsen the impact of nuisance flooding events lian et al 2015 shen et al 2019 therefore real time flood forecasting at the street scale is needed for early flood warning systems and flood risk management henonin et al 2013 the use of physics based 1d 2d dual drainage models is a traditional approach for simulating the depth and extent of surface flooding in urban areas kourtis et al 2017 these models simulate flow through sewer river systems and overland flow by coupling 1d and 2d hydrodynamic models fan et al 2017 lin et al 2006 seyoum et al 2012 many software packages such as hec ras 2d mike flood sobek deltares 2018 or tuflow bmt wbm 2016 are commercially available to facilitate 1d 2d flood simulation in urban scenarios although this approach can simulate realistic urban flooding with high resolution and accuracy the associated computational time can limit the application for early flood warning systems lhomme et al 2006 tanaka et al 2011 while the advancement in graphical processing unit gpu based parallel computing has sped up the execution of these 2d shallow water equation models for flood simulation high resolution real time flood forecasting is still challenging guo et al 2020 to enable real time flood forecasting recent studies have used response surface surrogates or metamodels box and wilson 1951 razavi et al 2012 simpson et al 2001 zhang et al 2018 where machine learning ml acts as a surrogate to emulate complex high fidelity physics based models berkhahn et al 2019 contreras et al 2020 these models are similar to the digital twin approach which is popular in manufacturing systems and building information modeling lu et al 2019 schleich et al 2017 and is beginning to be applied in water resources bartos and kerkez 2021 inan et al 2021 in this approach a database is generated with several explanatory variables and simulation outputs from a physics based model to train the surrogate model the surrogate model learns from the input output relationship rather than simulating complex physical processes to emulate the physics based model generated outputs after training the surrogate model is validated on independent data and then can make predictions on provided new input data with predictions made in seconds rather than the hours required by the original physics based model berkhahn et al 2019 zahura et al 2020 response surface surrogate models for real time flood forecasting applications have been used by several studies to predict flood depths volume and velocity bass and bedient 2018 bermúdez et al 2019 2018 chang et al 2010 contreras et al 2020 jhong et al 2017 liu and pender 2015 löwe et al 2021 most past studies have explored the ability of surrogate models in approximating pluvial and fluvial flood events or extreme typhoon events however the past studies have not emphasized relatively frequent nuisance flooding events due to high tide and rainfall in an urban coastal environment only two studies used tidal data as inputs for pluvial flood prediction bermúdez et al 2019 zahura et al 2020 none of the past studies investigated the potential of ml surrogates to predict flooding due to high tide or the combined occurrence of rainfall and high tide in coastal cities given that tidal flooding has increased in us coastal cities with cumulative impacts surpassing the impacts of rare extreme events moftakhari et al 2018 a real time flood forecasting model predicting not only flooding from extreme events but also nuisance flooding in coastal cities is urgently needed additionally most of the prior studies ignored topographic data in training the surrogate models some past studies used reference points to make flood predictions followed by interpolation based on the topology only studies by löwe et al 2021 and zahura et al 2020 used topographic information from urban settings in model training and found them essential in emulating pluvial flood depths the capability of the ml surrogates in approximating different flood dynamics based on topography is yet to be investigated to address the existing knowledge gaps this study builds on the work done by zahura et al 2020 to create a response surface surrogate model that emulates pluvial and tidal flooding simulated by a coupled 1d 2d hydrodynamic model tuflow calibrated and validated for the coastal city norfolk virginia usa an ml algorithm random forest rf was trained using two types of input features i roadway topography and ii environmental information for selected flood events while the output was tuflow simulated hourly water depths on the roadways in the study domain the rf surrogate s performance in predicting both pluvial and tidal flooding was evaluated for two different training approaches i training with only pluvial and no tidal events and ii training with both pluvial and tidal events these two training approaches were compared to evaluate the value of including tidal flooding explicitly within the training data sixteen rainfall dominant and eight tide dominant events were used for this purpose the surrogate models were tested on four rainfall and two high tide dominant events independent of the training events the physics based and surrogate models were validated using crowdsourced flood reports from the mobile app waze to build trust in the model predicted flooding the surrogate model s potential to differentiate between tidal dominate and rainfall dominate flooding while making predictions was also investigated as were approaches for gaining insight and interpretability of the rf model output overall this study advances the potential for creating surrogate ml flood models for real time street scale decision support that can capture combined pluvial and tidal flooding in coastal urban environments 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the city of norfolk virginia fig 1 located along the us east coast is one of the most vulnerable coastal cities to slr fears 2012 this coastal city and the surrounding hampton roads region are experiencing two times faster local slr than the global slr due to land subsidence and ocean circulation dynamics atkinson et al 2013 the frequency of nuisance flooding in norfolk has increased by 325 since 1960 burgos et al 2018 this increased flood frequency threatens the city which is home to 244 000 people and vital for the us economy and national security the city of norfolk is actively adapting coastal resilience strategies to become resilient to extreme events 2 2 environmental data the surrogate model required environmental data such as rainfall and tide level observations as inputs to predict water depths on streets based on characteristics of the given events these data were collected from hampton roads sanitation district hrsd and u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa stations from jan 1 2016 to dec 31 2018 ten hrsd rainfall stations were used to collect 15 minute rainfall observations daily rainfall and hourly tide level observations referenced to the north american vertical datum navd88 were collected from noaa s norfolk international airport noaa 2018a and sewells point station noaa 2018b respectively 2 3 topographic and roadway data topographic data were required as model input to distinguish between the topographic characteristics of the roadways causing flooding and validate the models with crowdsourced data from the u s geological survey usgs a digital elevation model dem with 1 m resolution usgs 2016 and lidar light detection and ranging point cloud data usgs 2013 for norfolk were collected a shapefile of norfolk street centerlines was collected through the city s official website city of norfolk gis bureau 2018 2 4 crowdsourced street scale flood data crowdsourced flood reports were collected from two sources the city of norfolk s system to track organize record and map storm sep 2010 dec 2019 and waze aug 2017 dec 2019 the city uses storm to record the impacts from storms including the coordinates of flooded locations reported by the city workers at a daily timescale waze owned by google is a gps navigation app that provides real time traffic updates and allows riders to report live updates on the street condition such as accidents flooded streets etc the exact time and coordinates of reported flooding were collected from waze the four locations with maximum reported flooding were identified using both storm and waze reports fig 1 flood reports around these locations mainly occurred during high tide s1 in fig 1 during both high tide and rainfall s2 in fig 1 and during rainfall events s3 and s4 in fig 1 as waze provided more extensive and diverse flood data with exact reporting time than storm it was used for model validation 2 5 simulated street scale flood depth data a 1d 2d dual drainage model tuflow built for a large area in norfolk by shen et al 2019 was used to simulate street level flood depth and generate output to train the surrogate model tuflow links 1d pipe flow solved using estry to 2d surface flow solved using 2d shallow water equations the urban flood model covered an area of 56 4 km2 in norfolk the pluvial flooding inside this area was generated internally as no rainfall generated flow from the surrounding basins entered the study domain the tide level at the outlet was considered the same as sewells point station which is the closest tide gauge to the study area this model required rainfall and tide level to simulate detailed surface flooding maps for every hour of the event at a spatial resolution of 5 m which was used to build the surrogate model 3 methodology 3 1 model data preprocessing four environmental and three topographic features were generated from the raw environmental and topographic data respectively table 1 the 15 min interval rainfall data from hrsd were aggregated to produce three rainfall features hourly rainfall to describe the rainfall during the hour of interest cumulative rainfall in the last 2 hr and cumulative rainfall in the last 72 h to describe antecedent soil moisture conditions or exceedance of stormwater system capacity from the past occurrences of rainfall due to the spatial variability of rainfall among stations rainfall features were interpolated across the study domain using inverse distance weighted interpolation as tide level is one of the dominant factors for flooding in coastal cities hourly tide level was used as an input feature the three topographic features derived from 1 m dem were elevation topographic wetness index twi and depth to water dtw elevation was used to describe the variation of street elevations within the study domain twi explains the likelihood of an area accumulating surface runoff based on local topography with higher twi indicating a higher tendency for runoff accumulation twi is defined as 1 twi ln α tan β where α contributing area per unit contour length and tan β local slope beven and kirkby 1979 dtw measures the soil moisture condition murphy et al 2007 for i a pixel on the landscape as 2 dtw dz i dx i a x c where dz i dx i sum of slopes across the least slope path from i to the closest pixel of waterbodies a 1 or 2 based on whether the pixel boundary is crossed parallelly or diagonally by the path and x c pixel resolution the lower value of dtw indicates the pixel on the landscape is closer to waterbodies in terms of both vertical and horizontal distance therefore wetter soil the input file for the surrogate model was prepared by extracting the input features for the streets within the study domain regarding the restriction of vehicular movement on a road during flood events we assumed that the deepest flood depth along a street would be sufficient for road closure decisions therefore the street centerline shapefile for norfolk was divided into segments with 50 m length due to lack of road width data we assumed the roads consisted of two lanes each 3 6 m wide the average lane width in the us us department of transportation 2014 the arcgis software system esri 2020 was implemented to prepare a shapefile of street segments where each segment was 50 m long and 7 2 m wide this shapefile was used to extract the mean and maximum of the input features and tuflow simulated hourly water depths respectively at each segment the information on pump stations operational at the underpasses in norfolk was unavailable to be incorporated in the tuflow model therefore the street segments representing underpasses were excluded from the analysis resulting in 16 914 segments to develop the surrogate model 3 2 training and testing data the rf surrogate models were developed using training data containing only rainfall events rf p and both rainfall and high tide events rf p t the daily rainfall data and higher high tide data collected from noaa were used to select the top 20 daily rainfall events table 2a and the top 10 high tide events table 2b these events were divided into training and testing with an 80 20 split agranoff et al 2006 with 16 rainfall events in training for rf p and 16 rainfall and 8 tide events in training for rf p t the number of hours for the rainfall and tidal training events were 375 and 282 respectively in our previous study we found that oversampling the minority class with flood depths 0 3 m and maintaining a one to one ratio between minority and majority depth 0 3 m groups improved predictive performance zahura et al 2020 using a 1 1 ratio between these groups resulted in training samples with 12 227 103 rows and 7 columns and 21 754 398 rows and 7 columns for rf p and rf p t respectively the predictive capability of both models was tested on four rainfall and two tide events test events were chosen based on the availability of waze data the chosen rainfall events for testing had a wide variety of storm events while testing high tide events were selected to represent tide events with considerable and minor occurrence of rainfall 3 3 ml algorithm rf regressor rf was used in this study because it is faster to tune and train than the other ml methods and preprocessing inputs to improve predictive accuracy is generally not needed ahmad et al 2017 the rf regressor used in this study is an ensemble ml algorithm that uses many decorrelated regression trees to make predictions breiman 2001 breiman et al 1984 tree based approaches tend to overfit to the training data random forest solves this problem by creating a collection of multiple trees where each tree learns from randomly chosen samples and input features and predictions are made by averaging the predictions from each tree additionally the overfitting problem can be solved by not using fully grown trees in the forest or pruning the trees this can be done by controlling the maximum depth of trees and the minimum number of samples required for splitting in addition to making predictions rf also provides an overall interpretation of feature importance known as gini importance by measuring the total decrease in mean squared error by each feature the rf regression was performed using sklearn ensemble randomforestregressor from python scikit learn module pedregosa et al 2011 scikit learn developers 2018 the rf regressor was optimized by tuning hyperparameters number of trees n estimators number of input features at each split max features and the maximum depth of a tree max depth the function gridsearchcv in the scikit learn module can find the optimal values of model hyperparameters by iterating all combinations of predefined hyperparameter values using k fold cross validation using the training data this function was applied to tune n estimators max features and max depth table 3 with 4 fold cross validation and the best values were 50 5 and none respectively however with max depth none there was minimal improvement in the average accuracy from cross validation for n estimators above 30 fig 2 a similarly with n estimators 30 increasing max depth beyond 40 caused little improvement in accuracy fig 2 b as the best values of max depth and n estimators did not improve model performance significantly and increased run time by consuming up to 97 computer memory 40 and 30 were set as the parameter values respectively a sample weight of 2 was assigned for samples with water depths 0 2 m to maximize the predictive performance while fitting the rf models 3 4 model evaluation the surrogate models accuracy and bias towards overprediction or underprediction in emulating tuflow simulated time series water depths on streets during the flood events were evaluated using root mean squared error rmse and mean error me for each street segment as 3 r m s e s m y t u f l o w s h y r f s h 2 n 4 me s m y tuflow s h y rf s h n where ytuflow and yrf were tuflow simulated and rf predicted water depth respectively on a street segment s during an hour h n represented the total number of hours with rainfall 0 mm or tide level 0 8 m from navd or tuflow simulated flood depths above 0 1 m during the events according to noaa a tide level above 0 845 m from navd is the threshold for minor flooding in norfolk sweet et al 2018 and flooding can occur below this threshold burgos et al 2018 therefore a tide level of 0 8 m above navd was used to identify flood depth relevant to tidal flooding the spatial performance of the surrogate models in mapping the maximum inundation extent and magnitude was evaluated for threshold depths 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m the inundation extent was defined with a wet dry threshold of 0 1 m bermúdez et al 2019 shen et al 2019 limiting high velocity water depth on streets shand et al 2011 thresholds of 0 2 and 0 3 m were used to identify different flood intensities as the air inlet height of passenger vehicles ranges within 0 25 0 35 m a street becomes impassable at 0 3 m of water depth ausroads 2008 yin et al 2016 also 0 3 m water depth can wash away cars and should be closed to ensure safety noaa national weather service 2018 therefore replicating the extent of such streets was important three performance metrics precision recall and f1 scores were used to evaluate rf s potential in emulating spatial flood patterns recall representing the percentage of tuflow simulated flooded streets emulated correctly by rf is calculated as 5 recall rf predicted true flooded streets total tuflow simulated flooded streets precision represents the percentage of correct rf predicted flooded streets and calculated as 6 precision rf predicted true flooded streets total rf predicted flooded streets both precision and recall values range between 0 and 1 lower recall and precision indicate underprediction and overprediction of flooding respectively compared to tuflow simulations higher values of these metrics are important for prompt action in hazardous locations and avoiding unnecessary actions in less threatening areas f1 score the harmonic mean of precision and recall is calculated as 7 f 1 score 2 precision recall precision recall the f1 score can reach a maximum value of 1 when both recall and precision are 1 indicating rf predicted and tuflow simulated inundation extents matched perfectly the sklearn metrics module in python scikit learn developers 2018 was used to calculate the performance measures 3 5 crowdsourced data processing and model validation flood reports from waze were used to validate the location and time of flood occurrences during the six test events waze data provide binary yes or no values rather than the flood depth to identify the flooded locations surrounding waze flood reports the viewshed tool on arcgis was implemented this tool determines locations on a raster surface visible from the observer location which is the location of waze reports in this study lidar point cloud data for norfolk were utilized to produce a dem raster the lidar point cloud data contain tree canopy heights over streets resulting in a higher elevation in the lidar derived dem than the street elevation and interfered with viewshed analysis at these locations elevation from lidar derived dem was substituted with street elevation from bare earth dem to obtain continuous viewshed street segments with 50 area covered by viewshed were used to extract the maximum water depth from tuflow and rf during the flood events the performance of the models was analyzed using hit rate h which describes the proportion of waze reported flood locations identified with 0 10 m of water depth by the models defined as 8 h hits hits misses where hits and misses indicated a flood report from waze with 0 10 m and 0 10 m of water depth respectively within its viewshed from the flood models the time difference between waze reports and peak flood depths was also evaluated 4 results and discussion 4 1 approximating flood depth comparison between tuflow simulated and rf p and rf p t predicted water depths on the four highest reported flooded streets during the pluvial and tidal test events are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively the rmses between tuflow simulated and surrogate model predicted water depths at the four locations and across the study domain are listed in table 4 as flooding on s1 is mostly tide driven the intensity of tuflow simulated flooding on this segment was low during the pluvial events which both surrogate models emulated at s2 and s3 the average difference between the tuflow simulated and rf p predicted peaks on aug 11 2018 and may 6 2018 events were 0 041 and 0 057 m respectively on oct 29 2017 event no flooding was simulated on s2 and s3 the may 28 2018 event had two separate rainfall peaks resulting in two flood peaks simulated by tuflow the first peak was overpredicted on s2 by 0 069 m by rf p and s3 by 0 10 and 0 065 m by rf p and rf p t respectively at s4 as the surrogate models drained out the accumulated water earlier than tuflow this segment had rmse higher than the 90th percentile for the pluvial events however the surrogate models predicted the peak time precisely and the predicted peak depths were close to the tuflow simulated peak and above 0 3 m to cause road closure decision during the pluvial events the predicted time series water depths by rf p and rf p t on the four segments were close and the differences between peak values ranged within 0 0 059 m on nov 8 2017 event tuflow simulation showed increasing flood depths on s1 and s3 during the astronomical high tide periods which receded during low tide rf p underpredicted the first and overpredicted the second peak on both s1 and s2 the differences between maximum depths were 0 23 and 0 13 m on s1 and s2 respectively rf p t predicted the peak depth and time of flooding on both segments accurately with rmse 0 046 and 0 025 m for s1 and s2 respectively as s3 and s4 are prone to rainfall driven flooding no flooding was simulated on these segments while rf p overpredicted the depth on s4 rf p t emulated no flooding on this street on sep 9 2018 event rf p overpredicted the peak depths on s1 with rmse 0 121 m rf p t prediction on s1 showed better agreement with tuflow simulation compared to rf p however rf p t predicted peaks occurred an hour earlier than the tuflow simulated peak resulting in an rmse 0 084 m higher than 90th percentile rmse 0 05 m as s4 experiences rainfall driven flooding two flood peaks with depth 0 1 m appeared in the tuflow simulation during hours with rainfall rather than the high tide period rf p could not identify the separate flood peaks during the rainfall period and predicted water depth ranging within 0 09 0 3 m throughout the day rf p t emulated the two flood peaks on s4 during the rainfall period however the peaks were overpredicted by 0 13 and 0 11 m although rf p predicted the presence of tidal flooding the estimated water depths showed a high deviation from tuflow simulated values on the contrary rf p t predicted flood depths with low errors for both pluvial and tidal events also it differentiated between the locations driven by pluvial and tidal flooding and accurately predicted the time of occurrence the capability of the surrogate models to predict water depths across the street segments was measured using segment wise rmse represented as histograms in fig 5 during aug 11 2018 event with the maximum daily rainfall among the testing events the average and 90th percentile rmse from rf p were the highest among the pluvial events among 16 914 segments 65 and 31 had rmse 0 05 and within 0 05 0 10 m respectively and only 4 had rmse 0 10 m 88 of the segments had rmse 0 05 m on may 6 2018 event with 3 falling above rmse 0 10 m the rest of the two pluvial events had 96 and 1 of the segments with rmses 0 050 and 0 10 m respectively for rf p t having high tide events in training increased rmses during the pluvial events except for aug 11 2018 event however the increase in average and 90th percentile rmses was less than 0 005 and 0 006 m respectively indicating the inclusion of tide events did not significantly affect the performance of rf p t the predictive ability of rf p was worse for the tidal events compared to the pluvial events the 90th percentile rmse on sep 9 2018 0 09 m was higher than aug 11 2018 0 078 m event and on nov 8 2017 event was higher than rmses during the other three pluvial events rf p t showed a significant decrease in rmses during the tidal events on average 92 and 1 segments had rmse 0 05 and 0 10 m respectively from rf p t predictions fig 6 shows the me between the simulated and predicted flooding on each road segment during pluvial and tidal flood events negative values of me indicate the mean water depths were overpredicted whereas positive values indicate underprediction me values for rf p during pluvial events were closer to zero with 1 3 and 2 of segments having me 0 025 and me 0 025 m respectively using rf p t the bias in prediction increased however only 3 and 4 2 of segments had me 0 025 and me 0 025 m respectively rf p showed more bias toward overprediction of mean depth with me 0 025 m for 35 of streets for tidal flood events while 14 5 of the segments had me 0 025 m using rf p t this bias in tidal flood prediction was reduced to me 0 025 m at 5 road segments and me 0 025 m at 9 segments although tide level was one of the input features for rf p there were high discrepancies between predicted and simulated water depth on tidal events while rf p t maintained similar rmses like rf p during pluvial events it improved predictions during high tide events therefore rf p t could serve as a unified flood prediction model as it emulated tuflow simulated flooding with low rmses on most of the segments for both types of flood events 4 2 flood extent mapping the recall precision and f1 scores evaluating the maximum extent of flooding from rf p and rf p t during the flood events for thresholds 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 m are listed in table 5 during the pluvial events for threshold 0 1 m defining flood boundary recall scores ranged within 0 83 0 96 indicating rf p emulated above 83 of the flood locations from tuflow simulation precision scores ranged within 0 72 0 92 indicating more than 72 of the predicted flood locations were correct for the pluvial events while precision scores remained consistently high throughout all the threshold values recall values dropped with an increased threshold rf p correctly predicted 55 87 and 50 85 of the flooded streets for 0 2 and 0 3 m thresholds respectively like rmses introducing tidal events in training for rf p t caused minimal alteration in recall and precision scores and the decrease in f1 scores was at most 0 04 for the tidal events with a threshold 0 1 m rf p predicted the extent of flooding less accurately than the pluvial events as reflected by the performance scores for thresholds 0 2 and 0 3 m f1 scores dropped below 0 58 for both tidal events suggesting rf p s poor predictive performance in emulating tidal flooding with high tide events in training for rf p t f1 improved up to 0 80 and 0 84 for events on nov 8 2017 and sep 9 2018 respectively on the nov 8 2017 and sep 9 2018 events rf p t correctly emulated 67 and 93 of the tuflow simulated flood extent and 71 and 78 of the roads unsafe to passenger vehicles respectively this suggested that using tide level as an input feature to develop surrogate flood models in an urban coastal environment was insufficient to correctly emulate the extent of tidal flooding or combined pluvial and tidal flooding training events should have representation from different flood types 4 3 validation using crowdsourced flood report fig 7 and fig 8 demonstrate the rainfall tide level and time of waze reports and the maximum water depth during the events within the viewshed of the waze reports respectively table 6 lists the h values quantifying the agreement between waze reports and flooding from tuflow and rf p t a maximum of 58 flood locations was reported on aug 11 2018 and 93 and 96 6 of the reports had maximum water depth ranging within 0 1 1 m inside viewshed according to tuflow and rf p t respectively the lowest h was found for tuflow on sep 9 2018 event by investigating the streets with base map imagery in arcmap and tuflow simulated water depth it was found that two reports had water depth 0 1 m within viewshed however creating segments with 7 2 m width did not cover the actual road width and missed the corners of the roads where flooding happened decreasing h similarly 1 1 and 3 flood reports on nov 8 2017 may 6 and aug 11 2018 respectively had water depths 0 10 m within viewshed which were missed due to the geometric bias reducing h overall 87 5 and 90 4 of the waze flood reports were associated with water depth 0 10 m from tuflow and rf p t respectively while this agreement validated both models it also suggested that rf p t could predict flood depth on the four highest reported flood locations and other user reported locations across the study domain the minor mismatch between waze and flood models could be resulting from the uncertainty regarding crowdsourced data reliability boutsis et al 2016 as experts do not generate these reports the perception of a flood would widely vary among the users the distance between 95 of the flood reports and the location of maximum flood depth ranged within 0 150 m reports located 150 m from the maximum flood depth had 0 10 m of water depth within 0 47 m on streets fig 9 demonstrates the difference between the time of the waze reports and the peak depths 68 of flood reports appeared within 1 h of the peak depth for all the test events as indicated by the boxplots the reports appearing 3 4 h from the peak depth on oct 29 2017 nov 8 2017 and aug 11 2018 had 0 10 m of water depth during or within 1 h of the reports the may 28 2018 event had two peak rainfalls generating two flood peaks although the maximum flood depth was simulated during the second peak flood reports appeared during the first peak fig 7 with depths ranging between 0 08 and 0 23 m therefore the time difference was calculated between the first peak and the flood reports for this event overall 17 28 and 55 of the reports appeared before during and after the time of peak flood depth respectively 4 4 feature importance rf generated gini importance measures the global importance of each feature for the whole dataset saarela and jauhiainen 2021 among the seven input features rf p found twi to be the most important in predicting street flooding followed by elv and hr 72 fig 10 td hr was the least important feature in rf p which could be due to the lack of representation of tidal flood events in training however rf p t computed importance of td hr dropped by 0 008 and was the least important feature despite tidal flood incidents improving flood prediction the importance of hr 72 increased by 0 10 and was the most important feature calculated by rf p t while the importance of twi dropped while rainfall and tide are the commonly known features for flooding in coastal cities rh and td hr were unimportant according to rf this deviation of feature importance from physical expectations could be due to the bias in gini importance towards variables varying in scale which are artificially preferred during splitting strobl et al 2007 also gini importance fails to find the true predictors when the relationship between predictors and response is weak archer and kimes 2008 correlations between training features and water depths varied between 0 30 and 0 43 rf p t indicating a weak predictor response relationship twi had the highest correlation coefficient 0 452 and 0 436 for rf p and rf p t respectively the second most correlated feature was hr 72 which experienced an increase in correlation coefficient from 0 349 rf p to 0 432 rf p t suggesting that correlation between the features and response might have influenced the global feature importance from rf an alternative approach for determining variable importance for rf is local interpretable model agnostic explanations lime ribeiro et al 2016 we applied lime for s1 and s3 during hours 17 00 and 9 00 for the aug 11 2018 and sep 9 2018 events respectively fig 11 for the aug 11 2018 event elv and rh were the top two features contributing positively towards flood prediction for both segments twi was important for both segments but contributed negatively to s1 and positively for s3 this may be because high twi for s3 caused runoff accumulation during rainfall whereas s1 had low twi and was impacted more by tidal flooding for the event on sep 9 2018 elv and td hr contributed positively to the tuflow simulated 0 499 m depth of water while all the other features had a negative effect in all four examples elv was the most important feature in explaining flood depth prediction while hr 72 was consistently one of the least important features while rh hr 2 and td hr were the least important features according to gini importance they played a crucial role in flood prediction according to the local analysis which is what one might expect given the physical understanding of flood generation therefore we suggest there is more value in analyzing variable importance locally using an approach like lime than global approaches like gini for flood applications 4 5 computational cost the comparison between the computational cost for tuflow and rf is listed in table 7 the computational time for tuflow model execution on cpus would be 120 hr per event morsy et al 2018 tuflow heavily parallelized compute hpc engine allowed simulation on two gpus and reduced execution time to 4 5 6 hr per event training time for rf p trained with 16 events containing 375 hr was 30 min which increased to 56 min for rf p t due to increased training samples 627 hr however the average time predicting each event was 4 5 and 4 2 s for rf p and rf p t respectively thus rf p t could make predictions 3800 times faster than tuflow with reasonable flood depth and extent prediction errors 5 conclusion this study resulted in rf surrogate models for real time street scale forecasting of both pluvial and tidal flooding using the coastal city of norfolk va as a study region responses from a physics based model tuflow were approximated by learning from inputs containing topographic variables for roadways and environmental variables for flood events and the corresponding target variable tuflow simulated water depths two surrogate models were trained with i only pluvial rf p and ii both pluvial and tidal rf p t flood events comparison between these approaches showed that training on pluvial events with the tide as an input inadequately predicted the depth and extent of inundation during high tide or combined rainfall and high tide occurrence in coastal cities the representation of both pluvial and tidal flood events in training significantly improved the predictive performance on test events by predicting 67 95 of the tuflow simulated flood extent with average rmses of water depth ranging within 0 029 0 054 m the predictive capability of the surrogate model for locations not in training was not explored in this study to apply this model in a different urban area may require retraining using corresponding topographic data and physics based model outputs future work should explore the transferability of this ml modeling approach to other urban areas analyzing the locations of waze flood reports showed that 87 5 and 90 4 of the reports had 0 10 m water depth within the reporter s visibility from tuflow simulated and rf p t predicted flooding respectively the distance between the reports and simulated flooding ranged within 0 150 m 68 of the reports were within 1 hr from the time of peak depth the agreement between time and location of flood reports with tuflow simulated and rf p t predicted flooding served as validation for both models the high agreement between the models and the flood reports suggested that the surrogate model could identify problematic flood spots on the roadway network in both space and time to support real time decisions for the locations with disagreement between flood reports and modeled results further work is needed to determine if this was due to errors in the crowdsourced data or errors with the model s predictive skill if the latter it would be interesting and worth determining if the error is in the physics based model itself or the ml surrogate model the rf algorithm can facilitate real time street flood forecasting due to its short runtime while maintaining an acceptable loss of accuracy compared to the high fidelity physics based model tuflow rf p t required 56 mins for training and 4 2 s on average for predicting each test event increasing the computational speed by a factor of 3800 compared to tuflow additionally rf provides global feature importance for the whole dataset which was analyzed to understand the contribution of input features in flood prediction the least important features from rf p t were surprisingly found to be hourly rainfall and tide level which are the main physical drivers of flooding in a coastal city analyzing local feature importance using lime revealed that these two features were significant in flood depth estimation with either positive or negative contribution levels based on the type of flood events thus while the global feature importance provides insight into the rf model s general behavior it can be biased towards the training data and affected by the correlation between inputs and target variable therefore to interpret any black box rf model for flood prediction or to perform feature selection the local contribution of features should be investigated in future studies credit authorship contribution statement faria

7972,study region combined sewer overflows cso of 671 functional urban areas fuas throughout the european union uk eu28 representing almost half of the eu28 population study focus cso loads can be quantified at the local scale through measurements or with calibrated hydrological models however they are difficult to quantify at a large scale e g regional or national due to a lack of data and the models used at local scale cannot be applied in the absence of knowledge of the combined sewer cs network this paper presents a 6 parameter lumped hydrological model to simulate a cs network and its overflows using population and rainfall data of 671 eu28 fuas new hydrological insights for the region when properly calibrated the model can predict the cso hydrographs as well as aggregated cso descriptors of a catchment with known impervious surface area connected to a cs with a reasonable reliability when model calibration is not possible using default values of the parameters enables a first approximation estimate of csos accurate within one order of magnitude which can be used to support scenario analysis for regional and continental cso management at the eu28 scale the estimated

combined sewers cs are a widespread reality in europe and elsewhere zabel et al 2001 pistocchi et al 2019 they are usually designed to collect the dry weather flow dwf and stormwater runoff and convey a certain amount of the combined wastewater flow dwf runoff to a wastewater treatment plant wwtp dwf is generally considered the combination of sanitary flow infiltration water and industrial wastewater discharged to urban sewers when the flow exceeds the maximum conveyance capacity of the network the surplus is discharged through combined sewer overflows csos into the environment the adverse impact exerted by csos on the receiving water bodies can be traced back to dwf pollutant loads substances transported by surface runoff and remobilization of in sewer sediments and sewer biofilm gromaire et al 2001 müller et al 2020 the volume frequency and duration of the overflows depend on the frequency and intensity of rainfalls on the design of the sewer system e g the amount of internal storage and on the acceptable flow at the wwtp zabel et al 2001 current studies suggest that urban runoff will increase due to urbanization and the intensification of the hydrological cycle due to climate change potentially increasing wastewater spills through csos meehl and tebaldi 2004 barceló and sabater 2010 keupers and willems 2013 balistrocchi and grossi 2020 infrastructure aging also enhances anthropogenic pressures and impacts dirckx et al 2011 rombouts et al 2013 bar zeev et al 2021 therefore csos are one of the main current and future challenges in urban wastewater management and the understanding of cso impacts is key to their mitigation joshi et al 2021 montserrat et al 2015 the urban waste water directive uwwtd european commission 1991 and the water framework directive european commission 2000 have motivated cso monitoring campaigns throughout europe see et al 2021 quantification of cso impacts and occurrence at the national scale can be found for the baltic sea bollmann et al 2019 uk environmental agency 2020 germany nickel and fuchs 2019 austria clara et al 2012 slovakia sztruhár et al 2002 and the netherlands liefting and de man 2017 and most of the other available data are local studies at the city scale see references in appendix c therefore scientific knowledge to support large scale quantitative policy analysis is lacking and the understanding of the magnitude of the problem at the european scale is still rather limited due to the absence of data no specific criteria and guidelines exist at the european level zabel et al 2001 most member states have regulated csos but requirements are heterogeneous and not always effectively enforced across the europe pistocchi et al 2019 in light of this the aim of this contribution is to present a hydrological model able to provide a preliminary estimation of cso loads at the catchment scale the model was applied to perform a screening level assessment of cso loads at the european union eu including former member state uk hereinafter eu28 level this work is organized in four parts 1 hydrological model development 2 model verification comparison of the modeled results with literature ones for specific catchments served by a cs 42 case studies with known cso volumes were collected covering uk germany the netherlands spain poland italy austria and france 3 sensitivity analysis of the model 4 application of the model at the eu28 scale considering the 671 eu28 functional urban areas fuas that represent the main urban agglomerations see pistocchi and dorati 2018 a fua consists of a densely inhabited city and of a surrounding area commuting zone whose labor market is highly integrated with the city dijkstra et al 2019 based on the results of our estimates we draw suggestions to improve the management of csos in the context of the eu legislation on urban wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrological model we make use of a lumped hydrological model describing a unit e g 1 m2 or 1 ha of impervious urban area served by a combined sewer system building on the simple model presented in pistocchi and dorati 2018 the model consists of a cascade of three linear reservoirs the linear reservoir is a concept widely used in similar studies e g van daal rombouts et al 2016 buytaert et al 2004 sun and bertrand krajewski 2013 the catchment surface the in sewer storage the network and the storage capacity at the head of the wastewater treatment plant hereinafter the storage tank or simply tank in sewer processes are neglected and we assume complete mixing of dwf and runoff the network and the tank are characterized by a reservoir constant k x t 1 and maximum storage volume w x mm where x 1 2 for the network and storage tank respectively before reaching the network a portion of rainfall is retained in the storage provided by the catchment surface e g ponds streets that is the upstream reservoir considered in our study whose maximum storage capacity is w 0 mm and the surface constant is k 0 the constant k x is defined in the following paragraphs the model considers as input a discrete time series of rainfall p t representing a sequence of rainfall mm at discrete intervals of constant time length δt in our case the available rainfall time series has a time step δt 3 h but the proposed hydrological model uses the dimensionless time t ranging from 0 to 1 instead of δt thus t 1 when δt 3 h rainfall s t retained on the surface within each time step is modeled as per the conceptual eq 1 1 s t min w 0 p t s t 1 if p t 0 s t 1 e k 0 t if p t 0 where w 0 is the maximum storage volume that can be retained on the catchment surface and t 1 the exponential term expresses the exponential decrease in the retained rainfall over the time the default value of the surface reservoir constant is set to the empirical value k 0 0 3 t 1 a value of k 0 0 1 t 1 affects cso aggregated estimations typically by 1 with few cases below 10 i e within the accuracy of our estimates see results section we considered that the reservoir fills when p t 0 without losing water infiltration and evaporation and it empties when p t 0 the emptying process is generally due to infiltration and evaporation the description of these dynamics in an urban context using an explicit model entails additional assumptions and model calibration in this study we decide to account for both phenomena empirically and implicitly through the reservoir depletion constant k 0 the rainfall that reaches the network r t mm per time step can be expressed by p t minus the rainfall that is retained on the surface 2 r t max 0 p t where δ w 0 s t 1 is the available storage capacity when δ 0 a portion of the rainfall can be retained while when δ 0 the storage capacity of the surface is full and no additional water can be stored in eq 1 the maximum value of s t 1 is w 0 thus δ cannot go below 0 s t 1 can be calculated as per eq 1 when the sewer network does not have a buffering capacity before the overflows the overflow volume e t mm from the network during one time step may be modeled as pistocchi and dorati 2018 3 e t max 0 r t q dwf k 1 w 1 where q dwf flow mm per time step is the dry weather flow in the sewer network k 1 w 1 is the maximum conveyance of the network whose exceedance triggers the overflow w 1 includes volumes of storage

overflows q dwf can be estimated from the population discharging in the sewer network assuming a representative per capita contribution q dwf when the network is modeled by a linear reservoir with

b c e d t where e a t e b t e c t e d t are defined in appendix b and a b c can be 0 or 1 this model can be implemented at the time step of the rainfall time series the combined sewer cs model parameters are the rate constant surface storage k 0 set at 0 3 t 1 the catchment storage w 0 mm the network dilution rate d n related to the maximum conveyance to the tank the network storage w 1 mm the tank dilution rate d t related to the maximum conveyance to the wwtp and the tank storage w 2 mm the reservoir constant k 2 can be calculated as q dwf d t w 2 as described above and k 1 q dwf d n w 1 the input data are the q dwf and population density or alternatively q dwf the linearity of the model makes it applicable to a unit catchment area and the results can then be proportionally extrapolated to a catchment of a given area by simple multiplication assuming no scale dependency of the parameters while the calculation is referred to the model time step we are interested in aggregated output such as the annual average cso volume v cso and the annual duration d of csos moreover we are interested in quantifying the pollution conveyed by csos as this is the blend of dwf and runoff it is important to estimate the relative importance of the two the content of dwf in cso can be estimated as pistocchi and dorati 2018 7 dwf content q dwf q dwf r t where r t can be calculated from eq 2 the model described above was benchmarked against the well known swmm model epa 2021 by comparing our model with a reference swmm model simulation the latter regarded a catchment served by a combined sewer network vaihingen germany with a buffer tank upstream of a wwtp assumed to represent the entire storage volume of the network the catchment had an impervious surface of 321 9 ha with a runoff coefficient of 54 and the tank volume was set to w 2 1 82 mm the dwf of the catchment was 41 25 l s and the maximum discharge before an overflow from the tank was 330 l s the swmm model was forced with a time series of precipitation from a real measurement station in germany lubw baden wuerttemberg 30 minute station data station no 62038 station vaihinmgen a d enz we set w 0 0 mm in order to neglect the effect of the surface storage and we considered as input to our model the precipitation during the year 2017 multiplied by the runoff coefficient the tank dilution rate was fixed at d t 8 while w 1 0 because all the storage is concentrated in the tank the network dilution ratio d n was calibrated to well reproduce the cso annual volume and the spill duration as discussed below the modeled cso from the tank is v cso 0 55 mm3 over 1 year while our model predicted v cso 0 53 mm3 after calibrating d n to a value of 17 to reproduce the benchmark data well the overflow duration was 191 5 h in our model and 174 5 h from the known time series fig 2 compares our model and the benchmark in terms of cso event volumes as well as a few representative hydrographs it shows how in spite of an overestimation of peak flows and underestimation of recession duration suggesting an overall underestimation of the system s flood buffering capacity the proposed hydrological model can mimic the number and volume of overflow events once appropriately calibrated in particular fig 2a shows an acceptable agreement between the spilled volumes per event of the two models but a clear worsening for small events when the cso spilled volume per event is below 4500 m3 the small events contribute to 10 of the annual spilled cso volume the cso volume of small events significantly depends on local design of the network and hydraulic parameters which cannot be captured by our simple hydrological model causing a discrepancy of predictions compared to the benchmark for smaller events fig 2b shows a portion of the hydrographs the retention effects of the network are actually not considered thus the resulting peaks and volumes represent a worst case scenario overall the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient is 0 87 slightly improving to 0 89 if the events below 4500 m3 are excluded 2 2 model verification the model was compared with literature data in order to check its accuracy we carried out a literature review to collect data of cso volumes durations and other useful metrics for representative urban catchments in the eu28 additional data not available in the public domain were collected by the authors from public and environmental national authorities a total of 42 cases were collected covering uk germany the netherlands spain poland italy austria and france distributed as shown in fig 3 the cso volume over a certain period of time typically the yearly value was known in 32 cases the spill duration in 11 cases and the rainfall volume triggering a cso p tr mm in 3 cases the collected case studies were also used as reference material to support the selection of the default values appendix 3 contains the collected case studies and the related model parameters for each urban area for which we retrieved information on csos we simulated overflows with the model taking into account the rainfall time series for the fua where the catchment was located the model parameters were adjusted to reflect the local characteristics as described in the references dwf dilution rates and storage capacities when dwf was not available it was estimated from total population connected to the cs network divided by the total impervious surfaces connected to the cs network based on the default qdwf 200 l day per capita see appendix e and table 1 for further details when some or all of the other parameters could not be estimated case specifically we considered the default values listed in tab 1 2 2 1 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed testing different values of w 0 w 2 and d t for six different catchments in order to explore how these hydrological parameters affect the results the maximum values of w 0 w 2 and d t were chosen based on the 42 case studies collected in appendix c for w 0 we assumed that an upper value could correspond to the surface storage allowed by an extensive greening of urban surfaces in line with quaranta et al 2021 we consider greening of 35 of the impervious surface with a 30 cm thick soil of effective porosity equal to 10 this corresponds to w 0 0 35 300 0 1 10 mm also in line with casal campos et al 2015 30 mm was tested only for the sensitivity analysis we considered an upper limit of w 2 10 mm i e w 1 w 2 15 mm in line with the highest values found in literature case study in utrecht the maximum d t value was 23 llopart mascaró et al 2015 and it is generally around 4 based on these considerations we selected for parameters w 0 and w 2 the values 0 1 mm 1 mm 5 mm 10 mm for w 0 we also explored the effects of a value up to 30 mm for d t the values 2 4 10 15 and 20 were chosen 2 3 application to the eu28 context in order to estimate cso loads at the eu28 scale the model was applied to 671 functional urban areas fuas that are the main urban agglomerations in the eu28 home to 320 090 394 inhabitants and covering 4 166 177 ha of impervious surface as described in pistocchi and dorati 2018 for each fua we used the population and impervious surface area hence population density and 3 hourly rainfall time series as described in pistocchi and dorati 2018 the population density in each fua was calculated with the hrl luisa combination corresponding to density data calculated with the population estimated from luisa lavalle et al 2015 and the impervious surface from hrl copernicus 2015 we considered the hrl luisa combination because the data for all the 671 fuas are known the reliability of satellite data is discussed in appendix d as described above we refer the calculation to an impervious unit area connected to a combined sewer cs within the fua the results are scaled to the whole fua through multiplication by the total impervious surface in the fua served by the cs the impervious surface served by a cs is estimated by multiplying the total impervious surface of the fua by the share of population served by cs cs assuming the values shown in pistocchi et al 2019 mostly based on the national average for each fua country in principle the model parameters can be calibrated for any combined sewer network with available overflow monitoring data provided that the inputs impervious area extent population of the combined sewer catchment and rainfall are representative however overflow data are not accessible for an analysis at the eu28 scale therefore we modeled overflows for all fuas in the eu28 using default values for the parameters chosen based on engineering practice and the literature e g zabel et al 2001 sun and bertrand krajewski 2013 morgan et al 2017 pistocchi et al 2019 rizzo et al 2020 as in table 1 by way of exception for germany and austria we assumed d n 30 based on expert judgment and data collected in appendix 3 moreover in the case of the netherlands the sewer discharge is typically conveyed from a storage volume to the wwtp by pumping and the pumping capacity is typically 0 7 mm h in addition to the dwf independent of the used storage volume the storage settling tank is not in line between the system and the wwtp in order to reflect this configuration in the model both the storage settling tank and the sewer network storage were combined in w 2 with unrestricted flow from w 1 to w 2 therefore we used a very high dilution rate of the network d n 10 000 in order to ensure that no overflow occurs from the network we then set w 1 1 5 mm and w 2 8 8 mm for all the other countries the default values of w 1 and w 2 are used the model output is a time series of overflow volumes and the respective dwf content with the same time step as the input rainfall however for our eu28 application we computed an aggregated model output for each fua including annual average volume of cso its dwf content and annual average duration of the spills the first indicator is key to represent the overall discharge of pollutants from combined sewers the second is required to characterize the pollution and the share of wastewater generated in the fua that does not undergo treatment before discharge the duration of spills is an unambiguous metric of the occurrence of short duration pollution events affecting the receiving water bodies 3 results 3 1 model verification a comparison of predicted annual cso volumes with those reported for the case studies listed in table 1 of appendix c is shown in fig 4 the absolute error is defined as 8 error x p x k n x kn where x p is the predicted result and x kn the known one for each case study the mean absolute error mae is then calculated the error on the estimated overflow volume v cso over the study period of each case typically 1 year ranges between 79 and 197 and the mae is 54 with no apparent relation between errors and catchment and cso output data table 2 shows the minimum and maximum reported and predicted values thus the extreme cases to which higher errors are associated the rainfall value that triggers the overflow p tr is also predicted within a factor 2 fig 4c d e for instance in the case of ecully the model usually indicates overflows when a rainfall event exceeds 15 mm but with few events already at 9 mm while the trigger rainfall event is reported to be 10 mm pers comm of jean luc bertrand krajewski the simulated p tr is 3 mm versus the detected one of 7 mm for torrelavega andrés doménech et al 2010 and 4 mm versus 7 mm for berlin matzinger et al 2009 these estimates are obtained using the default values and could be improved by locally calibrating cs parameters which is not an objective of this study our model estimates an average annual v cso 73 mm y for the dutch fuas weighted average with the fua impervious surface while government data estimates 46 mm y liefting and de man 2017 for the german case fuchs 2019 estimates 69 2 mm3 y of dwf discharged by csos corresponding to 1 4 of the total produced dwf referred to 35 million connected inhabitants to the cs 79 million x 45 where 45 is the cs share our model estimates 1 8 of discharged dwf and a cso annual volume of 37 mm3 y referred to 27 6 million of inhabitant the 94 main german fuas by a linear extrapolation 37 mm3 y correspond to 46 9 mm3 y for 35 million inhabitant which differs by 32 from 69 mm3 y the estimation of the cso volume does not depend on the volume itself but rather on the catchment characteristics the duration is predicted well within the range 50 200 h and the accuracy of the estimation reduces for more extreme events larger and smaller durations to improve the prediction for each catchment local design data would be necessary to better calibrate the model but these data are generally not available at the large scale nevertheless the results shown in fig 4 indicate that the predicted overflows can be regarded as a first approximation of the reported overflows the proposed hydrological model can be therefore used for a screening level assessment of cso loads at the eu28 level as it reflects the variability of the response of cso to the rainfall regime catchment and network characteristics covered by the representative test cases 3 2 sensitivity analysis in order to estimate how the above mentioned outputs are affected by the model parameters a sensitivity analysis was carried out for the surface storage w 0 tank storage w 2 and tank dilution rate d t w 1 was not tested because the hydrological model mostly depends on the value of w 1 w 2 rather than on the specific value of w 1 and w 2 this allowed to change the parameter w 2 and to take in mind that any combination of w 1 and w 2 such that their sum is equal to w 2 does not significantly affect the results for example results did not appreciably change when w 2 10 mm and w 1 5 mm or w 2 3 mm and w 1 12 mm for the innsbruck catchment the catchment with the highest value of annual rainfall p among the investigated ones table 3 the calculated annual cso volume is 357 mm y with w 2 3 mm and w 1 12 mm and 353 mm y with w 2 10 mm and w 1 5 mm the same for the other fuas where the differences are few percentage points the only cases where the model outputs depend on the specific values of w 1 and w 2 are for very high network dilution rates i e when d n 30 thus for the dutch case d n 10 000 as discussed above therefore local values for w 1 and w 2 were considered for the netherlands as discussed above we ran the model for six different combinations of rainfall time series and population density corresponding to catchments among those considered in the validation stage representative of the different geographic contexts of eu28 for each catchment we took the population density reported in the literature and the rainfall time series of the fua where the catchment is located table 3 we kept all parameters to their initial values and made one at a time among w 0 w 2 and d t vary over the respective ranges described above the results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 5 the surface storage capacity w 0 apparently affects the annual cso volume and spill duration while w 2 tank storage capacity affects it to a lesser extent the tank dilution rate d t reduces the annual cso especially when d t 8 that means that higher values do not affect appreciably the results and may only implicate higher costs retrofitting of the network at w 0 30 mm and 10 mm the dilution rate of the tank does not affect appreciably the results when considering the dwf content in the csos the tank storage w 2 does not significantly contribute while the dilution rate of the tank shows the highest benefits at d t 8 from the above mentioned results two key points can be derived 1 an increase in the surface storage w 0 exhibits more significant effects than a w 2 increase 2 a tank dilution rate above d t 8 yields practically no incremental benefits on cso reduction furthermore d t is limited by the fact that it is not possible to flush the wwtp with excessively diluted wastewater in order not to disrupt the activated sludge process the catchment with the highest cso volume among the six investigated in this section is innsbruck because the value of annual rainfall is the highest one while the catchments with the least duration are located in lodz and in comacchio which have the highest population density i e the highest dwf when the dwf is higher for a fixed network and tank dilution rate the conveyance of the network is higher and reduces the overflow frequency 3 3 application of the hydrological model to the eu28 scale with the default parameters discussed in table 1 we produced an estimate of the annual cso volume for each of the 671 fuas for a unit impervious surface catchment connected to a cs the volume of cso for the fua is then obtained multiplying this unit area cso volume by the impervious surface area of each fua and by the share of cs attributed to the fua usually extrapolating national average cs shares the resulting cso volume is v cso 5739 mm3 y the dwf content in cso is v dwf 460 mm3 y or 1 97 of the discharged dwf from 320 million people living in the 671 fuas the average spill duration per year is 95 h per fua with the smallest value 25 h in a spanish fuas and the highest ones in germany uk and austria typically 100 h probably associated to the higher d n used value with the highest value of 256 h in germany table 4 summarizes the results per eu member state uk 4 discussion the annual cso volume its dwf content and its duration can be predicted as a first approximation with the proposed hydrological model when the latter is parameterized on the basis of local catchment characteristics in a screening level assessment of cso loads at the eu28 level using default parameters that reflect the available evidence we estimated an annual cso volume across 671 fuas totaling 5739 mm3 y and conveying a content of dwf of 460 mm3 y representing 1 97 of the total dwf generated in the fua our approach suffers from uncertainties that can be only reduced through a more realistic representation of the catchments which requires data usually not available at the large scale as a first example we parameterized the impervious surface based on satellite imagery as the conveyance of the combined sewer network is a multiple of dwf by default estimated from total connected population divided by the total impervious surface our model calculation is likely to overestimate cso volumes in all cases where the connected impervious surface to the cs is significantly smaller than the total impervious area served by the cs we also tend to overestimate overflows where significant network storage capacity is available in excess of the default value we consider w 1 5 mm these two aspects can arguably account for the factor 2 errors found when comparing our predictions with documented literature case studies another factor affecting the total volume of cso at the regional scale is the share of combined sewers compared to separate sewers the uncertainty in the absolute value of cso volumes and duration is arguably less important when aiming at a comparison of policy scenarios at the eu scale in this case the model can be used to quantify the change in volumes and duration of overflows following from certain policies and measures with regard to v dwf we expect the concentration of pollutants in the overflow to be well approximated by c c 1 dwf c 2 runoff dwf runoff with dwf dry weather flow c 1 concentration in dwf c 2 concentration in runoff for certain contaminants e g pesticides metals polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon c 1 is considered to be close to 0 and c 2 is dominant on the contrary for other contaminants c 2 is practically 0 if we set c 2 0 the dwf content in cso dwf dwf runoff is a proxy for the concentration of such contaminants a reason why the dwf content in cso is computed as an indicator when it comes to contaminants mainly borne by runoff c 2 dominant on c 1 the event mean concentration is usually highly variable hence runoff volume was used as a proxy for pollution load furthermore we did not consider the release of in sewer pools of pollutants due to resuspension or erosion of sewer sediments and biofilm gasperi et al 2010 therefore it is expected that by applying c1 as a proxy for raw wastewater and c2 as a proxy for runoff entering sewer systems the total pollution load in csos is underestimated the amount of the underestimation depends on the specific pollutant considered for dissolved compounds that do not absorb to the sewer sediment or biofilm like several pharamceuticals and pesticides the underestimation will be negligible while for strongly sorbing compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs or metals the contribution of in sewer pools can be much higher gasperi et al 2010 the model also did not consider the state of the receiving water e g the amounts of dwf as percentage of the receiving water flow or volume we used a default dwf value of 200 l s per person in line with the recommendations of the uk ministry of housing local government s technical committee on storm overflows and the disposal of storm sewage 1970 by using a larger value of dwf per inhabitant the total amount of cso would reduce since the conveyance capacity of the simulated cs would increase so that our estimates can be considered precautionary i e they overestimate the cso volumes appendix e supplementary material demonstrates the effect of dwf and population density in more detail the sensitivity analysis we have presented shows how in order to reduce csos an increase in the surface storage w 0 is more effective than an analogous w 2 increase highlighting the fact that surface management strategies e g disconnection to cs or retention measures by urban greening are more effective than increasing the storage capacity of the network of the same amount surface storage is best implemented through urban greening measures as it can generate additional environmental and social benefits however implementing extensive greening in urban areas poses challenges that need to be properly addressed quaranta et al 2022 5 conclusions the knowledge of cso volumes and duration suffers from severe gaps at regional and eu scale and there are limited possibilities for the quantitative analysis of policies at this level here we have presented a first attempt at modeling csos at the european scale cso volumes and dwf contents were quantified by implementing a hydrological model which has proven to be reasonably realistic against independent evidence measurements or more detailed studies when properly parameterized we used the model with default parameter values for the appraisal of the scale of the problem at the eu28 scale a higher accuracy and finer detail can be arguably achieved only through specific studies at the local scale particularly when it comes to finding optimal trade off between surface water quality improvement and costs of measures mitigation can entail green solutions but in many cases also disconnecting impervious surfaces besides increasing network capacity through infrastructure retrofitting grey solutions or better management e g real time control solutions cost effective management of cso requires solutions tailored to the specific conditions in each urban area case specific optimal strategies may be better accommodated in appropriately designed management plans at the urban scale addressing together multiple objectives including urban development climate change adaptation biodiversity support and pollution control and potentially mobilizing investments from a variety of actors within this context measures such as urban greening may bring several additional benefits while helping prevent runoff and have potentially higher benefits to costs ratio compared to their grey alternatives optimization of the existing infrastructure including real time control may also significantly reduce csos the model presented here may be used to support an assessment of cso mitigation strategies with related benefits and costs at the regional scale before delving into specific

7972,study region combined sewer overflows cso of 671 functional urban areas fuas throughout the european union uk eu28 representing almost half of the eu28 population study focus cso loads can be quantified at the local scale through measurements or with calibrated hydrological models however they are difficult to quantify at a large scale e g regional or national due to a lack of data and the models used at local scale cannot be applied in the absence of knowledge of the combined sewer cs network this paper presents a 6 parameter lumped hydrological model to simulate a cs network and its overflows using population and rainfall data of 671 eu28 fuas new hydrological insights for the region when properly calibrated the model can predict the cso hydrographs as well as aggregated cso descriptors of a catchment with known impervious surface area connected to a cs with a reasonable reliability when model calibration is not possible using default values of the parameters enables a

combined sewers cs are a widespread reality in europe and elsewhere zabel et al 2001 pistocchi et al 2019 they are usually designed to collect the dry weather flow dwf and stormwater runoff and convey a certain amount of the combined wastewater flow dwf runoff to a wastewater treatment plant wwtp dwf is generally considered the combination of sanitary flow infiltration water and industrial wastewater discharged to urban sewers when the flow exceeds the maximum conveyance capacity of the network the surplus is discharged through combined sewer overflows csos into the environment the adverse impact exerted by csos on the receiving water bodies can be traced back to dwf pollutant loads substances transported by surface runoff and remobilization of in sewer sediments and sewer biofilm gromaire et al 2001 müller et al 2020 the volume frequency and duration of the overflows depend on the frequency and intensity of rainfalls on the design of the sewer system e g the amount of internal storage and on the acceptable flow at the wwtp zabel et al 2001 current studies suggest that urban runoff will increase due to urbanization and the intensification of the hydrological cycle due to climate change potentially increasing wastewater spills through csos meehl and tebaldi 2004 barceló and sabater 2010 keupers and willems 2013 balistrocchi and grossi 2020 infrastructure aging also enhances anthropogenic pressures and impacts dirckx et al 2011 rombouts et al 2013 bar zeev et al 2021 therefore csos are one of the main current and future challenges in urban wastewater management and the understanding of cso impacts is key to their mitigation joshi et al 2021 montserrat et al 2015 the urban waste water directive uwwtd european commission 1991 and the water framework directive european commission 2000 have motivated cso monitoring campaigns throughout europe see et al 2021 quantification of cso impacts and occurrence at the national scale can be found for the baltic sea bollmann et al 2019 uk environmental agency 2020 germany nickel and fuchs 2019 austria clara et al 2012 slovakia sztruhár et al 2002 and the netherlands liefting and de man 2017 and most of the other available data are local studies at the city scale see references in appendix c therefore scientific knowledge to support large scale quantitative policy analysis is lacking and the understanding of the magnitude of the problem at the european scale is still rather limited due to the absence of data no specific criteria and guidelines exist at the european level zabel et al 2001 most member states have regulated csos but requirements are heterogeneous and not always effectively enforced across the europe pistocchi et al 2019 in light of this the aim of this contribution is to present a hydrological model able to provide a preliminary estimation of cso loads at the catchment scale the model was applied to perform a screening level assessment of cso loads at the european union eu including former member state uk hereinafter eu28 level this work is organized in four parts 1 hydrological model development 2 model verification comparison of the modeled results with literature ones for specific catchments served by a cs 42 case studies with known cso volumes were collected covering uk germany the netherlands spain poland italy austria and france 3 sensitivity analysis of the model 4 application of the model at the eu28 scale considering the 671 eu28 functional urban areas fuas that represent the main urban agglomerations see pistocchi and dorati 2018 a fua consists of a densely inhabited city and of a surrounding area commuting zone whose labor market is highly integrated with the city dijkstra et al 2019 based on the results of our estimates we draw suggestions to improve the management of csos in the context of the eu legislation on urban wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrological model we make use of a lumped hydrological model describing a unit e g 1 m2 or 1 ha of impervious urban area served by a combined sewer system building on the simple model presented in pistocchi and dorati 2018 the model consists of a cascade of three linear reservoirs the linear reservoir is a concept widely used in similar studies e g van daal rombouts et al 2016 buytaert et al 2004 sun and bertrand krajewski 2013 the catchment surface the in sewer storage the network and the storage capacity at the head of the wastewater treatment plant hereinafter the storage tank or simply tank in sewer processes are neglected and we assume complete mixing of dwf and runoff the network and the tank are characterized by a reservoir constant k x t 1 and maximum storage volume w x mm where x 1 2 for the network and storage tank respectively before reaching the network a portion of rainfall is retained in the storage provided by the catchment surface e g ponds streets that is the upstream reservoir considered in our study whose maximum storage capacity is w 0 mm and the surface constant is k 0 the constant k x is defined in the following paragraphs the model considers as input a discrete time series of rainfall p t representing a sequence of rainfall mm at discrete intervals of constant time length δt in our case the available rainfall time series has a time step δt 3 h but the proposed hydrological model uses the dimensionless time t ranging from 0 to 1 instead of δt thus t 1 when δt 3 h rainfall s t retained on the surface within each time step is modeled as per the conceptual eq 1 1 s t min w 0 p t s t 1 if p t 0 s t 1 e k 0 t if p t 0 where w 0 is the maximum storage volume that can be retained on the catchment surface and t 1 the exponential term expresses the exponential decrease in the retained rainfall over the time the default value of the surface reservoir constant is set to the empirical value k 0 0 3 t 1 a value of k 0 0 1 t 1 affects cso aggregated estimations typically by 1 with few cases below 10 i e within the accuracy of our estimates see results section we considered that the reservoir fills when p t 0 without losing water infiltration and evaporation and it empties when p t 0 the emptying process is generally due to infiltration and evaporation the description of these dynamics in an urban context using an explicit model entails additional assumptions and model calibration in this study we decide to account for both phenomena empirically and implicitly through the reservoir depletion constant k 0 the rainfall that reaches the network r t mm per time step can be expressed by p t minus the rainfall that is retained on the surface 2 r t max 0 p t where δ w 0 s t 1 is the available storage capacity when δ 0 a portion of the rainfall can be retained while when δ 0 the storage capacity of the surface is full and no additional water can be stored in eq 1 the maximum value of s t 1 is w 0 thus δ cannot go below 0 s t 1 can be calculated as per eq 1 when the sewer network does not have a buffering capacity before the overflows the overflow volume e t mm from the network during one time step may be modeled as pistocchi and dorati 2018 3 e t max 0 r t q dwf k 1 w 1 where q dwf flow mm per time step is the dry weather flow in the sewer network k 1 w 1 is the maximum conveyance of the network whose exceedance triggers the overflow w 1 includes volumes of storage

to a wwtp through an equalization tank modeled as a linear reservoir with a constant k 2 and constrained by a maximum capacity w 2 whose exceedance triggers another overflow this overflow is shown to be given by the following equation that means that depending on the situation the overflow volume can be one among e a t e b t e c t e d t see appendix b for details 6 e t a e a t b e b t c e c t 1 a b c e d t where e a t e b t e c t e d t are defined in appendix b and a b c can be 0 or 1 this model can be implemented at the time step of the rainfall time series the combined sewer cs model parameters are the rate constant surface storage k 0 set at 0 3 t 1 the catchment storage w 0 mm the network dilution rate d n related to the maximum conveyance to the tank the network storage w 1 mm the tank dilution rate d t related to the maximum conveyance to the wwtp and the tank storage w 2 mm the reservoir constant k 2 can be calculated as q dwf d t w 2 as described above and k 1 q dwf d n w 1 the input data are the q dwf and population density or alternatively q dwf the linearity of the model makes it applicable to a unit catchment area and the results can then be proportionally extrapolated to a catchment of a given area by simple multiplication assuming no scale dependency of the parameters while the calculation is referred to the model time step we are interested in aggregated output such as the annual average cso volume v cso and the annual duration d of csos moreover we are interested in quantifying the pollution conveyed by csos as this is the blend of dwf and runoff it is important to estimate the relative importance of the two the content of dwf in cso can be estimated as pistocchi and dorati 2018 7 dwf content q dwf q dwf r t where r t can be calculated from eq 2 the model described above was benchmarked against the well known swmm model epa 2021 by comparing our model with a reference swmm model simulation the latter regarded a catchment served by a combined sewer network vaihingen germany with a buffer tank upstream of a wwtp assumed to represent the entire storage volume of the network the catchment had an impervious surface of 321 9 ha with a runoff coefficient of 54 and the tank volume was set to w 2 1 82 mm the dwf of the catchment was 41 25 l s and the maximum discharge before an overflow from the tank was 330 l s the swmm model was forced with a time series of precipitation from a real measurement station in germany lubw baden wuerttemberg 30 minute station data station no 62038 station vaihinmgen a d enz we set w 0 0 mm in order to neglect the effect of the surface storage and we considered as input to our model the precipitation during the year 2017 multiplied by the runoff coefficient the tank dilution rate was fixed at d t 8 while w 1 0 because all the storage is concentrated in the tank the network dilution ratio d n was calibrated to well reproduce the cso annual volume and the spill duration as discussed below the modeled cso from the tank is v cso 0 55 mm3 over 1 year while our model predicted v cso 0 53 mm3 after calibrating d n to a value of 17 to reproduce the benchmark data well the overflow duration was 191 5 h in our model and 174 5 h from the known time series fig 2 compares our model and the benchmark in terms of cso event volumes as well as a few representative hydrographs it shows how in spite of an overestimation of peak flows and underestimation of recession duration suggesting an overall underestimation of the system s flood buffering capacity the proposed hydrological model can mimic the number and volume of overflow events once appropriately calibrated in particular fig 2a shows an acceptable agreement between the spilled volumes per event of the two models but a clear worsening for small events when the cso spilled volume per event is below 4500 m3 the small events contribute to 10 of the annual spilled cso volume the cso volume of small events significantly depends on local design of the network and hydraulic parameters which cannot be captured by our simple hydrological model causing a discrepancy of predictions compared to the benchmark for smaller events fig 2b shows a portion of the hydrographs the retention effects of the network are actually not considered thus the resulting peaks and volumes represent a worst case scenario overall the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient is 0 87 slightly improving to 0 89 if the events below 4500 m3 are excluded 2 2 model verification the model was compared with literature data in order to check its accuracy we carried out a literature review to collect data of cso volumes durations and other useful metrics for representative urban catchments in the eu28 additional data not available in the public domain were collected by the authors from public and environmental national authorities a total of 42 cases were collected covering uk germany the netherlands spain poland italy austria and france distributed as shown in fig 3 the cso volume over a certain period of time typically the yearly value was known in 32 cases the spill duration in 11 cases and the rainfall volume triggering a cso p tr mm in 3 cases the collected case studies were also used as reference material to support the selection of the default values appendix 3 contains the collected case studies and the related model parameters for each urban area for which we retrieved information on csos we simulated overflows with the model taking into account the rainfall time series for the fua where the catchment was located the model parameters were adjusted to reflect the local characteristics as described in the references dwf dilution rates and storage capacities when dwf was not available it was estimated from total population connected to the cs network divided by the total impervious surfaces connected to the cs network based on the default qdwf 200 l day per capita see appendix e and table 1 for further details when some or all of the other parameters could not be estimated case specifically we considered the default values listed in tab 1 2 2 1 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed testing different values of w 0 w 2 and d t for six different catchments in order to explore how these hydrological parameters affect the results the maximum values of w 0 w 2 and d t were chosen based on the 42 case studies collected in appendix c for w 0 we assumed that an upper value could correspond to the surface storage allowed by an extensive greening of urban surfaces in line with quaranta et al 2021 we consider greening of 35 of the impervious surface with a 30 cm thick soil of effective porosity equal to 10 this corresponds to w 0 0 35 300 0 1 10 mm also in line with casal campos et al 2015 30 mm was tested only for the sensitivity analysis we considered an upper limit of w 2 10 mm i e w 1 w 2 15 mm in line with the highest values found in literature case study in utrecht the maximum d t value was 23 llopart mascaró et al 2015 and it is generally around 4 based on these considerations we selected for parameters w 0 and w 2 the values 0 1 mm 1 mm 5 mm 10 mm for w 0 we also explored the effects of a value up to 30 mm for d t the values 2 4 10 15 and 20 were chosen 2 3 application to the eu28 context in order to estimate cso loads at the eu28 scale the model was applied to 671 functional urban areas fuas that are the main urban agglomerations in the eu28 home to 320 090 394 inhabitants and covering 4 166 177 ha of impervious surface as described in pistocchi and dorati 2018 for each fua we used the population and impervious surface area hence population density and 3 hourly rainfall time series as described in pistocchi and dorati 2018 the population density in each fua was calculated with the hrl luisa combination corresponding to density data calculated with the population estimated from luisa lavalle et al 2015 and the impervious surface from hrl copernicus 2015 we considered the hrl luisa combination because the data for all the 671 fuas are known the reliability of satellite data is discussed in appendix d as described above we refer the calculation to an impervious unit area connected to a combined sewer cs within the fua the results are scaled to the whole fua through multiplication by the total impervious surface in the fua served by the cs the impervious surface served by a cs is estimated by multiplying the total impervious surface of the fua by the share of population served by cs cs assuming the values shown in pistocchi et al 2019 mostly based on the national average for each fua country in principle the model parameters can be calibrated for any combined sewer network with available overflow monitoring data provided that the inputs impervious area extent population of the combined sewer catchment and rainfall are representative however overflow data are not accessible for an analysis at the eu28 scale therefore we modeled overflows for all fuas in the eu28 using default values for the parameters chosen based on engineering practice and the literature e g zabel et al 2001 sun and bertrand krajewski 2013 morgan et al 2017 pistocchi et al 2019 rizzo et al 2020 as in table 1 by way of exception for germany and austria we assumed d n 30 based on expert judgment and data collected in appendix 3 moreover in the case of the netherlands the sewer discharge is typically conveyed from a storage volume to the wwtp by pumping and the pumping capacity is typically 0 7 mm h in addition to the dwf independent of the used storage volume the storage settling tank is not in line between the system and the wwtp in order to reflect this configuration in the model both the storage settling tank and the sewer network storage were combined in w 2 with unrestricted flow from w 1 to w 2 therefore we used a very high dilution rate of the network d n 10 000 in order to ensure that no overflow occurs from the network we then set w 1 1 5 mm and w 2 8 8 mm for all the other countries the default values of w 1 and w 2 are used the model output is a time series of overflow volumes and the respective dwf content with the same time step as the input rainfall however for our eu28 application we computed an aggregated model output for each fua including annual average volume of cso its dwf content and annual average duration of the spills the first indicator is key to represent the overall discharge of pollutants from combined sewers the second is required to characterize the pollution and the share of wastewater generated in the fua that does not undergo treatment before discharge the duration of spills is an unambiguous metric of the occurrence of short duration pollution events affecting the receiving water bodies 3 results 3 1 model verification a comparison of predicted annual cso volumes with those reported for the case studies listed in table 1 of appendix c is shown in fig 4 the absolute error is defined as 8 error x p x k n x kn where x p is the predicted result and x kn the known one for each case study the mean absolute error mae is then calculated the error on the estimated overflow volume v cso over the study period of each case typically 1 year ranges between 79 and 197 and the mae is 54 with no apparent relation between errors and catchment and cso output data table 2 shows the minimum and maximum reported and predicted values thus the extreme cases to which higher errors are associated the rainfall value that triggers the overflow p tr is also predicted within a factor 2 fig 4c d e for instance in the case of ecully the model usually indicates overflows when a rainfall event exceeds 15 mm but with few events already at 9 mm while the trigger rainfall event is reported to be 10 mm pers comm of jean luc bertrand krajewski the simulated p tr is 3 mm versus the detected one of 7 mm for torrelavega andrés doménech et al 2010 and 4 mm versus 7 mm for berlin matzinger et al 2009 these estimates are obtained using the default values and could be improved by locally calibrating cs parameters which is not an objective of this study our model estimates an average annual v cso 73 mm y for the dutch fuas weighted average with the fua impervious surface while government data estimates 46 mm y liefting and de man 2017 for the german case fuchs 2019 estimates 69 2 mm3 y of dwf discharged by csos corresponding to 1 4 of the total produced dwf referred to 35 million connected inhabitants to the cs 79 million x 45 where 45 is the cs share our model estimates 1 8 of discharged dwf and a cso annual volume of 37 mm3 y referred to 27 6 million of inhabitant the 94 main german fuas by a linear extrapolation 37 mm3 y correspond to 46 9 mm3 y for 35 million inhabitant which differs by 32 from 69 mm3 y the estimation of the cso volume does not depend on the volume itself but rather on the catchment characteristics the duration is predicted well within the range 50 200 h and the accuracy of the estimation reduces for more extreme events larger and smaller durations to improve the prediction for each catchment local design data would be necessary to better calibrate the model but these data are generally not available at the large scale nevertheless the results shown in fig 4 indicate that the predicted overflows can be regarded as a first approximation of the reported overflows the proposed hydrological model can be therefore used for a screening level assessment of cso loads at the eu28 level as it reflects the variability of the response of cso to the rainfall regime catchment and network characteristics covered by the representative test cases 3 2 sensitivity analysis in order to estimate how the above mentioned outputs are affected by the model parameters a sensitivity analysis was carried out for the surface storage w 0 tank storage w 2 and tank dilution rate d t w 1 was not tested because the hydrological model mostly depends on the value of w 1 w 2 rather than on the specific value of w 1 and w 2 this allowed to change the parameter w 2 and to take in mind that any combination of w 1 and w 2 such that their sum is equal to w 2 does not significantly affect the results for example results did not appreciably change when w 2 10 mm and w 1 5 mm or w 2 3 mm and w 1 12 mm for the innsbruck catchment the catchment with the highest value of annual rainfall p among the investigated ones table 3 the calculated annual cso volume is 357 mm y with w 2 3 mm and w 1 12 mm and 353 mm y with w 2 10 mm and w 1 5 mm the same for the other fuas where the differences are few percentage points the only cases where the model outputs depend on the specific values of w 1 and w 2 are for very high network dilution rates i e when d n 30 thus for the dutch case d n 10 000 as discussed above therefore local values for w 1 and w 2 were considered for the netherlands as discussed above we ran the model for six different combinations of rainfall time series and population density corresponding to catchments among those considered in the validation stage representative of the different geographic contexts of eu28 for each catchment we took the population density reported in the literature and the rainfall time series of the fua where the catchment is located table 3 we kept all parameters to their initial values and made one at a time among w 0 w 2 and d t vary over the respective ranges described above the results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 5 the surface storage capacity w 0 apparently affects the annual cso volume and spill duration while w 2 tank storage capacity affects it to a lesser extent the tank dilution rate d t reduces the annual cso especially when d t 8 that means that higher values do not affect appreciably the results and may only implicate higher costs retrofitting of the network at w 0 30 mm and 10 mm the dilution rate of the tank does not affect appreciably the results when considering the dwf content in the csos the tank storage w 2 does not significantly contribute while the dilution rate of the tank shows the highest benefits at d t 8 from the above mentioned results two key points can be derived 1 an increase in the surface storage w 0 exhibits more significant effects than a w 2 increase 2 a tank dilution rate above d t 8 yields practically no incremental benefits on cso reduction furthermore d t is limited by the fact that it is not possible to flush the wwtp with excessively diluted wastewater in order not to disrupt the activated sludge process the catchment with the highest cso volume among the six investigated in this section is innsbruck because the value of annual rainfall is the highest one while the catchments with the least duration are located in lodz and in comacchio which have the highest population density i e the highest dwf when the dwf is higher for a fixed network and tank dilution rate the conveyance of the network is higher and reduces the overflow frequency 3 3 application of the hydrological model to the eu28 scale with the default parameters discussed in table 1 we produced an estimate of the annual cso volume for each of the 671 fuas for a unit impervious surface catchment connected to a cs the volume of cso for the fua is then obtained multiplying this unit area cso volume by the impervious surface area of each fua and by the share of cs attributed to the fua usually extrapolating national average cs shares the resulting cso volume is v cso 5739 mm3 y the dwf content in cso is v dwf 460 mm3 y or 1 97 of the discharged dwf from 320 million people living in the 671 fuas the average spill duration per year is 95 h per fua with the smallest value 25 h in a spanish fuas and the highest ones in germany uk and austria typically 100 h probably associated to the higher d n used value with the highest value of 256 h in germany table 4 summarizes the results per eu member state uk 4 discussion the annual cso volume its dwf content and its duration can be predicted as a first approximation with the proposed hydrological model when the latter is parameterized on the basis of local catchment characteristics in a screening level assessment of cso loads at the eu28 level using default parameters that reflect the available evidence we estimated an annual cso volume across 671 fuas totaling 5739 mm3 y and conveying a content of dwf of 460 mm3 y representing 1 97 of the total dwf generated in the fua our approach suffers from uncertainties that can be only reduced through a more realistic representation of the catchments which requires data usually not available at the large scale as a first example we parameterized the impervious surface based on satellite imagery as the conveyance of the combined sewer network is a multiple of dwf by default estimated from total connected population divided by the total impervious surface our model calculation is likely to overestimate cso volumes in all cases where the connected impervious surface to the cs is significantly smaller than the total impervious area served by the cs we also tend to overestimate overflows where significant network storage capacity is available in excess of the default value we consider w 1 5 mm these two aspects can arguably account for the factor 2 errors found when comparing our predictions with documented literature case studies another factor affecting the total volume of cso at the regional scale is the share of combined sewers compared to separate sewers the uncertainty in the absolute value of cso volumes and duration is arguably less important when aiming at a comparison of policy scenarios at the eu scale in this case the model can be used to quantify the change in volumes and duration of overflows following from certain policies and measures with regard to v dwf we expect the concentration of pollutants in the overflow to be well approximated by c c 1 dwf c 2 runoff dwf runoff with dwf dry weather flow c 1 concentration in dwf c 2 concentration in runoff for certain contaminants e g pesticides metals polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon c 1 is considered to be close to 0 and c 2 is dominant on the contrary for other contaminants c 2 is practically 0 if we set c 2 0 the dwf content in cso dwf dwf runoff is a proxy for the concentration of such contaminants a reason why the dwf content in cso is computed as an indicator when it comes to contaminants mainly borne by runoff c 2 dominant on c 1 the event mean concentration is usually highly variable hence runoff volume was used as a proxy for pollution load furthermore we did not consider the release of in sewer pools of pollutants due to resuspension or erosion of sewer sediments and biofilm gasperi et al 2010 therefore it is expected that by applying c1 as a proxy for raw wastewater and c2 as a proxy for runoff entering sewer systems the total pollution load in csos is underestimated the amount of the underestimation depends on the specific pollutant considered for dissolved compounds that do not absorb to the sewer sediment or biofilm like several pharamceuticals and pesticides the underestimation will be negligible while for strongly sorbing compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs or metals the contribution of in sewer pools can be much higher gasperi et al 2010 the model also did not consider the state of the receiving water e g the amounts of dwf as percentage of the receiving water flow or volume we used a default dwf value of 200 l s per person in line with the recommendations of the uk ministry of housing local government s technical committee on storm overflows and the disposal of storm sewage 1970 by using a larger value of dwf per inhabitant the total amount of cso would reduce since the conveyance capacity of the simulated cs would increase so that our estimates can be considered precautionary i e they overestimate the cso volumes appendix e supplementary material demonstrates the effect of dwf and population density in more detail the sensitivity analysis we have presented shows how in order to reduce csos an increase in the surface storage w 0 is more effective than an analogous w 2 increase highlighting the fact that surface management strategies e g disconnection to cs or retention measures by urban greening are more effective than increasing the storage capacity of the network of the same amount surface storage is best implemented through urban greening measures as it can generate additional environmental and social benefits however implementing extensive greening in urban areas poses challenges that need to be properly addressed quaranta et al 2022 5 conclusions the knowledge of cso volumes and duration suffers from severe gaps at regional and eu scale and there are limited possibilities for the quantitative analysis of policies at this level here we have presented a first attempt at modeling csos at the european scale cso volumes and dwf contents were quantified by implementing a hydrological model which has proven to be reasonably realistic against independent evidence measurements or more detailed studies when properly parameterized we used the model with default parameter values for the appraisal of the scale of the problem at the eu28 scale a higher accuracy and finer detail can be arguably achieved only through specific studies at the local scale particularly when it comes to finding optimal trade off between surface water quality improvement and costs of measures mitigation can entail green solutions but in many cases also disconnecting impervious surfaces besides increasing network capacity through infrastructure retrofitting grey solutions or better management e g real time control solutions cost effective management of cso requires solutions tailored to the specific conditions in each urban area case specific optimal strategies may be better accommodated in appropriately designed management plans at the urban scale addressing together multiple objectives including urban development climate change adaptation biodiversity support and pollution control and potentially mobilizing investments from a variety of actors within this context measures such as urban greening may bring several additional benefits while helping prevent runoff and have potentially higher benefits to costs ratio compared to their grey alternatives optimization of the existing infrastructure including real time control may also significantly reduce csos the model presented here may be used to support an assessment of cso mitigation strategies with related benefits and costs at the regional scale before delving into specific

7973,study region carbonate karstified aquifers represent one of the most important groundwater reservoirs for both drinking purposes and environmental preservation currently the recharge discharge equilibrium in these aquifers is at risk of depletion from withdrawal increases and global change effects based on these factors detailed analyses of recharge distribution over the last 20 years 2001 2020 both in terms of rainfall and snow melting contributions have been carried out for the gran sasso regional aquifer central italy study focus using the same input data water budgets at different time scales were calculated using the turc thornthwaite and aplis methods in addition simplified future scenarios considering the real risk of climate change effects have been implemented by applying an increase in temperature and a shortage of snow coverage periods new hydrological insights the obtained aquifer recharge values are similar and a significant contribution to recharge from snowmelt has also been highlighted the measured spring discharge values are higher with respect to the calculated recharge especially in drought periods underlining the resilience of groundwater resources in the gran sasso aquifer these values are also confirmed by the different responses of spring discharge to recharge variations a significant decrease in recharge and consequently in baseflow discharge is conceivable for future scenarios revealing that immediate optimization measures are required to correct groundwater resources management and to avoid potential emergency conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords recharge assessment renewable resources karst aquifers central italy groundwater budget 1 introduction groundwater resources represent the main source of freshwater for human uses and for drinking purposes in particular chen 2017 hartmann et al 2014 while at the same time they play a fundamental role in maintaining a healthy environment which includes surface water bodies and the biosphere as a whole hartmann et al 2021 martín arias et al 2020 high permeability and significant storativity coupled with relevant precipitation rates are responsible for the consistent amount of renewable and long term resources stored in aquifers bakalowicz 2005 kaufmann 2016 among hydrogeological systems fractured and karstified carbonate rocks have a main role in hosting groundwater both in terms of diffuse and concentrated infiltration and of spring discharge with infiltration rates close to the precipitation amount both in humid and arid conditions berthelin et al 2020 such karst aquifer outcrops cover more than 20 of european territory and their springs supply water to several large cities and their citizens chen 2017 stevanović 2019 in addition the european and mediterranean karst aquifers are frequently concentrated in mountain ridges and peaks where they receive relevant to their elevation the highest rate of precipitation including snow contribution persistent on soil for several months all these characteristics coupled with peculiar groundwater dual flow by karst conduits and by fracture network increase the relevance for evaluating groundwater resource amounts withdrawal management and effective recharge rates over time in light of the effects of the normal seasonal and yearly variations of precipitation inputs hartmann et al 2021 for all these reasons fractured and karstified aquifers must be considered strategic to appropriately developing human society and maintaining environmental quality at the global level but especially at the mediterranean scale the recharge discharge equilibrium in groundwater systems threatened by human withdrawals since at least the last century is now under additional risk of depletion due to climate change which undoubtedly modifies the recharge and discharge mechanisms as demonstrated by several recent studies xanke and liesch 2022 chen et al 2018 hartmann et al 2014 2017 intergovernmental panel on climate change 2019 kundzewicz et al 2008 this is notably relevant for karst aquifers which are particularly susceptible to climate change impacts taylor and greene 2008 consequently the balance between natural renewable resources and human needs for drinking and civil purposes has to be rediscussed and where necessary adapted to ensure the maintenance of appropriate water resource amounts and of ecosystem survival for future generations this is necessary to achieve sustainable management of karst groundwater resources faced with reduced recharge and increased groundwater use therefore water planners require improved and specifically adapted tools for the management of karst water resources based on this framework the karma project granted under the prima call horizon 2020 programme of the european union prima 2018 achieves substantial progress in the hydrogeological understanding and sustainable management of karst water resources across several scales from hydrogeological basin to catchment of a single spring to obtain valuable information notably for stakeholders on recharge groundwater vulnerability and groundwater dependent ecosystems for the entire mediterranean area ollivier et al 2020 our research group concentrated on central italy where most groundwater resources are hosted by large fractured and partially karstified aquifers reaching the extent of approximately one thousand of km2 receiving rainfall amounts higher than 1000 mm year with a mean infiltration of approximately 700 mm year and corresponding to the major ridges of the territory which are frequently located at elevations higher than 2000 m asl the paradigmatic example of such aquifers is the gran sasso mountain which includes the highest peak of central italy approximately 3000 m asl and the lowest latitude european glacier known as calderone grunewald and scheithauer 2010 pecci et al 2008 tallini et al 2013 and which is expected to disappear in a few years in this paper we present the results of an updated water balance evaluation for the gran sasso aquifer and its springs with the double aim a to distribute the recharge rate to small recharge areas instead of considering a mean value and to evaluate the infiltration distribution with altitude and snow cover and b to verify the potential trend of recharge during the last twenty years the obtained results have practical applications on the one hand to provide updated information to drinking water companies and local authorities and to improve water management in order to optimize the use of available water resources at the aquifer scale and on the other hand to offer an example of possible impacts of climate change effects on groundwater resources to be extended in similar contexts in italy and at the mediterranean scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrogeological setting the gran sasso aquifer has been studied in detail over the last 25 years adinolfi falcone et al 2008 2012 amoruso et al 2011 2013 2014 barbieri et al 2005 boni et al 1986 de luca et al 2016 farroni et al 1999 ferracuti et al 2006 and its mean infiltration rate has been evaluated to be approximately 700 mm year the gran sasso hydrostructure is defined as a calcareous karstic aquifer system with a total extension of approximately 1000 km2 and it can be considered the most representative karst aquifer of the central southern apennines fig 1 at a glance the gran sasso hydrogeological system as described in amoruso et al 2013 is characterised by meso cenozoic carbonate units that host the aquifer bounded along the northern side by terrigenous units miocene flysch representing the regional aquiclude and along the southern side by quaternary continental deposits regional aquitard the gran sasso massif is characterized by the typical karst features of the central apennines where active plio quaternary tectonics have caused the recent ﬁlling of intramontane plains and river valleys by clastic and alluvial deposits cavinato and de celles 1999 the deposition of alluvial sediments precluded karst system evolution in the saturated zone causing the development of mature karst features in recharge areas that are not reflected in discharge areas barbieri et al 2005 at the massif core an endorheic basin with a tectonic karst origin called campo imperatore mean elevation 1650 m a s l acts as a preferential recharge area of the gran sasso aquifer and is fed by high rainfall and snowfall rates tallini et al 2013 the gran sasso karst aquifer hosts a unique regional wide groundwater table with a mean hydraulic gradient of 5 20 amoruso et al 2013 the aquifer has a total discharge ranging from 18 m3 s to 25 m3 s from its springs including a highway tunnel drainage tapped for drinking water on both sides the spring discharge influenced by the recharge rate is showing during last five years some lowering testified by the drinking supply companies tapping the springs the peculiarity of the gran sasso aquifer is also due to the high percentage of spring withdrawals for drinking purposes and its position inside the gran sasso and laga mts national park testifying to the dual need of providing for the human population without compromising the environment and the ecosystems however the very distinctive characteristic of the gran sasso aquifer is its groundwater drainage by two parallel tunnels drilled approximately 50 years ago to realize a highway which intercepts approximately 1 5 m3 s of groundwater close to 1000 m asl modifying the natural setting of the aquifer and inducing the discharge reduction of some springs adinolfi falcone et al 2008 amoruso et al 2013 celico et al 2005 the tunnels are still active and represent an unusual potential source of contamination to groundwater because they are tapped immediately beneath the road by lateral drainages at the aquifer core this unique interference is compounded by the presence within the highway tunnels of the noteworthy underground laboratories of the nuclear physics national institute these conditions cause the temporary suspension of the european rule for drinking water safeguard zones european commission 2000 2007 in tapping tunnel drainages throughout the aquifer approximately 25 of its renewable resources are tapped for drinking purposes mainly from springs including highway tunnel drainage and limited by well withdrawals 2 2 water balance calculation and parameter estimation the evaluation of the gran sasso rainfall has been carried out by considering two annual gradients for the northern and southern slopes of the massif scozzafava and tallini 2001 the gradients were calculated by linear correlation of altitude and climatic parameter data rainfall temperature snow acquired by 21 gran sasso thermorain gauges over a period of 20 years 2001 2020 the campotosto and assergi gauges respectively p1 and p2 in fig 1 table 1 have been considered as reference data for both northern and southern slopes the gradients were then applied from the selected gauges identifying rainfall distribution values over the entire aquifer for each year in addition the average rainfall values were derived from data from the entire monitoring period 2001 2020 by applying the two calculated gradients annual maps of rainfall distribution and isohyets were created from 2001 to 2020 and for the average year fig 2a using arcgis 10 3 software with a 100 100 m pixel raster the adopted reference system of coordinates is wgs 1984 utm zone 33 n the analysed area extends approximately 1034 km2 the elevation map was derived by the digital elevation model dem fig 2b an estimation of the temperature gradient and the related isotherm maps have also been computed by linear correlation among all existing gauges and applying the obtained gradient with respect to the castel del monte gauge selected as reference starting point p3 in fig 1 table 1 through the analysis of data the net infiltration and consequently the gran sasso water budget were computed using three different approaches the turc 1954 thornthwaite thornthwaite and mather 1957 and aplis andreo et al 2008 methods to verify the reliability of the three methods for recharge assessment the turc method tur for the estimation of real evapotranspiration etr at the yearly scale turc 1954 has been applied to assess the net inflow values the effective infiltration of the gran sasso aquifer has also been calculated at the monthly scale for the solar year starting in january by applying the thornthwaite method thr and modified to discriminate between runoff and net infiltration by applying the soil curve numbers dilshad and peel 1994 for different recharge areas inside the aquifer the maximum water storage in the soil adopted as the field capacity value has been associated with each curve number as described by scozzafava and tallini 2001 by this method the role of unsaturated soil in influencing the etr has also been considered it is noteworthy that most of the recharge area has negligible or very limited soil thickness due to direct rock outcrops which frequently occur in karst regions the modified thornthwaite method has been applied to obtain the different parameters useful to determine the infiltration value such as etp etr and field capacity and to assess the monthly water budget consequently the annual rainfall gradient ga calculated as previously discussed has been considered as a starting point to derive the monthly rainfall gradients gm by 1 1 g m i rm i ra i ga where i 1 12 month gm is the unknown variable rm is the monthly rainfall and ra is the annual rainfall scozzafava and tallini 2001 in other words monthly rainfall gradients have been obtained considering the ratio between monthly rainfall and total rainfall of each gauge both the above described methods are based on the hydrological budget equation expressed by incoming and outgoing volumes 2 2 i p etr r the runoff parameter r according to scozzafava and tallini 2001 has been considered to be approximately 0 3 of the total rainfall the negligible role of runoff in carbonate fractured and karstified aquifers of central italy has been well known and consolidated for a long time boni et al 1986 in addition to the described methodologies based on climatic parameters the aplis method apr has been applied to directly estimate the mean annual recharge of carbonate aquifers expressed as a percentage of precipitation andreo et al 2008 a combination of geological geographic and morphologic variables such as altitude a slope p lithology l infiltration landforms i soil types s and a correction factor fh dependent on hydrogeologic behaviour is used for the evaluation in addition to input parameters such as average annual rainfall and its spatial distribution see fig 2a to obtain a map of the average recharge rate available information is transformed into dimensionless values from 1 to 10 by a ranking system and subsequently used in the following eq 3 3 r a p 3x l 2x i s 0 9 fℎ where the weight of each parameter is intended to represent its relevance to the recharge rate the lithology l has a triple influence as those of altitude a slope p and soil type s while areas of preferential infiltration i are twice as important the obtained annual recharge rate was grouped into five recharge classes in addition apr allows us to obtain maps of the spatial distribution of recharge by the superimposition of the following gis information layers slope dem map in fig 2b based on a 20 20 m cell and a lithological hydrogeological map different scores have been assigned to each lithology based mainly on their fracturing and karstification the lithology score ranges from 10 to 2 assigned to the aquifer and to the aquiclude respectively even the area of campo imperatore defined as a preferential recharge area has been identified with the maximum score areas of preferential infiltration were downloaded from the geomorphological map of pai a regional management tool https autoritabacini regione abruzzo it index php carta geomorfologica pai the soil map was derived from the geoportal of the abruzzo region the main geometric reference from which the land use limits were taken was represented by the 1997 aima digital orthophoto scale 1 10000 and landsat tm5 satellite images 30 30 m pixels the last calculated parameter is the recharge correction factor fh which depends on the hydrogeological characteristics of the rock outcrops and is expressed as a percentage of precipitation a combinatory procedure has been applied to produce a single calculation algorithm that enables the determination of the recharge percentage resulting from apr application among 100 100 m rasters for the whole domain the isohyet map fig 2a has been overlapped with the aplis map to obtain the infiltration and recharge rate of the aquifer the gran sasso aquifer water budget and recharge rate depend not only on rainfall but also on seasonal snow cover and related snowmelt contributions to infiltration fazzini and bisci 1999 to calculate the snowmelt fraction a monthly gradient was applied through a linear correlation between the altitude and the monthly snowfall sum for the 1960 1990 period where available p1 and p4 in fig 1 and table 1 in other words a literature snow gradient fazzini and bisci 1999 has been applied considering the real data measured at the two reference stations p1 and p4 and consequently deriving the snow thickness value at higher and lower elevations by this way a snow coverage function of the elevation has been obtained for each snowing month november to april with related snow thickness increasing with elevation the obtained monthly gradients were then used to identify the fraction of recharge due to snow for the 2010 2020 period when snow data from campo imperatore p4 in fig 1 and table 1 were available in this case snow evaluation was based on the hydrological year starting since november until april of the following solar year due to the absence of real snowfall data for the 2001 2009 period the snowmelt contribution was estimated for this period as 15 of the recharge applying a precautionary rate with respect to the 20 obtained from real data during the 2010 20 period this additional recharge contribution has been applied to the infiltration calculated by all three methods tur etr apr for each observation year and on average equally spreading the snow recharge during the three snow melting months of march april and may 2 3 main spring discharge data analyses to compare the water balance calculated through the different methods and to evaluate the springs response to aquifer recharge variations discharge data for the main springs have been collected and analysed discharge data for the monitoring period 2001 2020 have been provided mostly by water suppliers and the regional environmental agency and then coupled with data obtained during previous research projects adinolfi falcone et al 2012 amoruso et al 2011 information on spring discharge has been collected at different time scales from hourly to seasonal scales depending on the purposes of monitoring most of the spring data are unfortunately not continuous for the analysed period missing information has been derived starting from the known discharge measures and estimated as the average of the available data in case of missing discharge data for the whole year the spring discharge has been assumed from the correlation line equation obtained comparing real known spring discharge with the expected discharge obtained from the tur water balance calculation by this way a reasonable discharge value has been assigned to the years with missing data of single springs the acquired data were checked and validated the real mean discharges calculated for the 2001 2020 period for each spring are summarized in table 2 and consider each observation solar year 3 results the calculated gradients of both rainfall and temperature have been applied to the whole domain the computed annual rainfall gradients are 30 mm 100 m for the southern slope and 42 mm 100 m for the northern slope the obtained temperature gradient was 0 59 c 100 m the benchmark for snow monitoring was the campo imperatore gauge s4 in fig 1 and table 1 and the applied monthly gradients corresponded to 3 8 cm 100 m for november 4 2 cm 100 m for december 6 7 cm 100 m for january 3 3 cm 100 m for february 2 4 cm 100 m for march and 4 9 cm 100 m in april consequently snow coverage on the aquifer and its thickness have been obtained in each 100 100 cell for the entire period with real data 2010 2020 the snow fall has been converted in equivalent mm of rain 1 cm of snow 1 mm of rain considering a negligible contribution to runoff 0 3 of total rainfall the net infiltration was calculated using the three previously mentioned methods details are included in the supplementary file tables s1 s3 3 1 turc method tur the average annual recharge calculated over the 20 year period using the turc method tur is 19 9 m3 s including a contribution due to snowmelt of 3 2 m3 s the average etr value is approximately 444 mm y while the average infiltration value from rainfall corresponds to 508 mm y which is integrated with 98 mm y due to snowmelt the year 2007 shows the lowest recharge of 11 5 m3 s 10 m3 s from rainfall and 1 5 m3 s from snowmelt while 2013 has the highest recharge of 30 7 m3 s 26 m3 s from rainfall and 4 7 m3 s from snowmelt fig 3 shows the calculated recharge including the snowmelt component differently calculated for 2001 2009 15 of recharge and 2010 2020 from real data 3 2 thornthwaite method thr using the thornthwaite method thr the calculated average annual recharge results in approximately 18 5 m3 s including a contribution from snowmelt of 3 2 m3 s the average value of etr is approximately 491 mm y while the corresponding infiltration value is 558 mm y 2006 was the driest year with a recharge of 9 8 m3 s of which 8 5 m3 s was from rainfall and 1 3 m3 s was from snowmelt while 2013 had the highest recharge of 27 2 m3 s 22 6 m3 s was from rainfall and 4 7 m3 s was from snowmelt the main results are summarized in fig 4 3 3 aplis method apr through the aplis method apr the gran sasso aquifer recharge rates are predominantly moderate with an effective infiltration percentage of 51 6 of the total rainfall the gran sasso massif according to apr is characterized by a preferential recharge area the campo imperatore basin with an infiltration rate of 76 7 fig 5 the concentrated infiltration phenomena are due to the combination of different relevant parameters such as the carbonate complex outcrop fracture density scarce vegetation cover and limited soil thickness however in limited areas near the boundaries the presence of low permeability deposits reduces recharge to low 20 40 and very low 20 levels fig 5 allogenic contributions are considered negligible according with a very limited contribution by runoff 0 3 of total rainfall the aquifer recharge through direct infiltration was calculated by overlaying the obtained recharge rate map with the rainfall map obtained for each year the average recharge rate is 19 4 m3 s 3 2 m3 s from snowmelt and 16 2 m3 s from rainfall and the equivalent average infiltration value is 594 mm y 496 mm y from rainfall and 98 mm y from snowmelt for tur 2007 is characterized by a minimum recharge rate of 13 7 m3 s 11 9 m3 s from rainfall and 1 8 m3 s from snowmelt while for tur and thr 2013 is characterized by the highest recharge rate of 21 3 m3 s including recharge due to snowmelt of 4 7 m3 s fig 6 3 4 main spring discharge data to verify the consistency of the estimated recharge values a comparison with the discharge data of the main springs fig 1 and table 2 of the same 2000 2020 period was carried out the capo pescara spring the largest spring located in the south eastern corner of the aquifer has not been included because it is fed by both the sirente and gran sasso aquifers with a prevailing contribution from the sirente aquifer scozzafava and tallini 2001 petitta and tallini 2002 as shown in fig 1 a groundwater seepage from the sirente aquifer towards the capo pescara spring s9 is certified recent studies stoch et al 2016 suggest that capo pescara discharge is fed prominently from the sirente aquifer with a minority contribution from gran sasso aquifer due to the impossibility to quantitatively assess the gran sasso aliquot of the discharge its contribution to the water budget has been neglected accepting an underestimation of the total discharge of the gran sasso aquifer the total long term mean discharge of the aquifer corresponds to 20 4 m3 s the springs of the tirino valley s7 and s8 including minor streambed springs are characterized by a consistent and constant discharge over time accounting for approximately 60 of the total gran sasso spring discharge 4 discussion 4 1 recharge evaluation comparison the reliability and representativity of the different applied methodologies can be assessed by comparing the results obtained through the three approaches both in terms of recharge values and their distribution in the study area the analysis was conducted on both rainfall recharge values and total recharge rainfall snowmelt results the calculated mean rainfall recharge and related standard deviation sd are 16 7 4 2 m3 s for tur 15 3 3 9 m3 s for thr and 16 2 2 4 m3 s for apr showing a difference among mean values lower than calculated standard deviations 1 5 m3 s in addition for tur and apr 1 sd includes 75 of the calculated values while for thr it includes 70 of the values highlighting the adequate representativity and accuracy of the adopted methods the same analysis carried out on total recharge values rainfall snowmelt for the 2010 2020 period shows mean sd values of 21 3 5 2 m3 s 19 3 5 1 m3 s and 20 6 3 4 m3 s for tur thr and apr respectively differences among mean values are confirmed to be lower than calculated standard deviations and the mean 1 sd includes 73 of obtained results for tur and apr and 64 for thr the comparability of the adopted approaches has been tested by matching results among different methods in detail the comparison between rainfall recharge values shows an r2 of 0 74 comparing thr and apr and an r2 of 0 83 comparing thr and tur while the tur apr correlation line indicates the highest r2 of 0 94 probably due to the same annual scale basis looking at total recharge values 2010 2020 monitoring period the obtained r2 values are 0 92 between tur and thr 0 97 between tur and apr and 0 89 between thr and apr the increase in correlation considering the total recharge including the snow effect supports the hypothesis of significant contributions from snow to recharge at the same time the correlation increase also indirectly testifies to the representativity of the approach adopted for snow recharge estimation by all methods a higher recharge value was recorded in 2013 while the driest years were recognized in the two year periods 2006 07 and 2011 12 in addition a common decreasing trend in recharge values has been identified from 2014 to 2020 with the only exception recorded in 2018 where measured rainfall values were higher as in other areas of central italy lancia et al 2020 sappa et al 2019 the analyses of the values obtained through apr highlight that recharge distribution is strongly dependent on the elevation belt despite lithology and infiltration landforms having weights of 3 and 2 respectively in the aplis formula the medium low altitude belts unlike the tur and thr results seem to be strongly influenced by recharge variations especially in drought years conversely the high altitude belts guarantee even with different weights the highest recharge rates confirming the results of the tur and thr recharge distribution analyses the role of high elevation areas in aquifer recharge processes becomes even more important considering the influence of snow coverage and consequent melting as mentioned in the previous paragraphs the contribution of snow melting to the water balance has been calculated using real data only for recent years 2010 2020 when it was found that 60 of snow recharge comes from altitudes higher than 1400 m a s l while the remaining 40 arrives from elevations ranging between 600 m and 1400 m a s l 4 2 total spring discharge and computed recharge analysis to verify the reliability of the recharge values obtained with the application of different methods the real total spring discharge tsd and the recharge values gathered from the three methods tur thr apr were compared to assess tsd all major springs were considered see fig 1 and paragraph 3 4 covering close to 100 of the total aquifer discharge fig 7 shows the comparison between the annual values of recharge obtained by the three applied methods and the measured discharge of the aquifer in principle recharge represents the annual renewable resources in an aquifer while discharge is expected to fit only partially with recharge values due to the storage parameter in the hydrological budget nevertheless karst aquifers usually show a fast response to recharge inputs and consequently for this case study a high correlation between recharge and discharge values at the annual scale is expected in fact tur and tsd values are well correlated r2 0 86 fig 7l showing a slight overestimation of tur with respect to tsd for the rainy years when tur 22 5 m3 s and a slight underestimation for drought years a similar match r2 0 85 was obtained by tsd and recharge calculated with thr fig 7c in this case a general underestimation of thr with respect to tsd was observed which was more evident in the driest years the comparison between apr and tsd shows the best alignment with respect to the xy line fig 7r but with a lower correlation r2 0 81 confirming a slight underestimation trend of apr with respect to tsd the three comparisons in fig 7 highlight that aquifer discharge is higher than the calculated stored recharge of the same year the reason for this finding can be attributed to different causes an underestimation of aquifer recharge due to the adopted procedure for rainfall and snow contributions could be one cause we cannot exclude this possibility but this condition is more clearly evident for years with a low recharge rate and the applied methods for recharge assessment are the same for all years an overestimation of aquifer discharge due to input to springs from different hydrogeological basins could be another cause we exclude this possibility due to several studies based on hydrochemistry and isotope data indicating that no external recharge areas can affect the gran sasso spring discharge a third possibility the most reliable in our opinion is the so called memory effect which is able to modulate the response of the springs to meteoric recharge fiorillo and doglioni 2010 frequently occurring in regional karst aquifers in other words during years having a limited recharge rate the spring discharge is sustained not only by the corresponding recharge input which is directly connected with the karst system but also by a significant and persistent base flow which is due to the circulation in the secondary fracture network and matrix porosity enhancing the role of the aquifer storage capacity this memory effect would be more evident including in the tsd the contribution from capo pescara spring s9 we initially discarded going deeper into the recharge discharge comparison process the annual mean discharge referred to each of the considered main springs belonging to the gran sasso aquifer has been compared with the total recharge calculated with tur the analyses of the trend over time of tur and single spring discharge allowed classification into three groups depending on the observed correlation specifically the five main springs show a significant correlation with respect to tur r2 0 45 three are characterized by a limited match with an r2 ranging between 0 25 and 0 45 while five seem to be unrelated to recharge variation r2 0 25 as stated in section 2 3 the strong heterogeneity in real spring discharge available data sometimes incomplete for the considered period surely affects the obtained correlation values in addition the analyses of annual recharge discharge correlation clearly highlight the different responses of springs pointing out immediate or time delayed responses with respect to computed recharge variations at the annual scale the discharge of springs located on the northern side of the gran sasso massif s1 to s6 in fig 1 shows a fast response to annual recharge variations tur a clear example is represented by the rio arno spring s2 in fig 1 fed by the top level of the aquifer tallini et al 2014 in fact as shown in fig 8 the annual rio arno spring discharge blue dots follows the variation observed for tur orange bars years characterized by high recharge rates are reflected on high spring discharge values and vice versa as confirmed by an r2 of 0 54 in contrast springs monitored on the southern side s7 s13 in fig 1 reflect the variation in aquifer recharge with some delay in fact the southern drainage discharge of the highway tunnel s10 in fig 1 seems to follow the effect of the variations in aquifer recharge with a year delay fig 9a reflecting the effect of a rainy or dry year by an increase or decrease in annual discharge one year later consequently in comparing tur and discharge data the r2 significantly increases from a value of 0 30 to a value of 0 56 applying spring discharge values to the previous year calculated recharge the delay is more evident at the tirino river s9 in fig 1 whereby the annual tur value shows its effects with approximately a two year delay fig 9b the comparison between spring discharge and tur highlights that no correlation r2 0 01 is obtained comparing data without applying any delay in spring response while r2 increases to 0 44 when comparing discharge values to recharge from two years prior these results are consistent with the conceptual regional model of groundwater flow petitta and tallini 2002 tallini et al 2013 2014 where tirino river springs s9 in fig 1 are supplied by the regional aquifer and are characterized by a steady state regime considering the hydrogeological features of this spring the observed delay recorded in its disdose response to variations in aquifer recharge is in agreement with the hypothesis as mentioned above of the memory effect the memory effect is widely used to assess the response of groundwater in karst systems massei et al 2006 mayaud et al 2019 meeks and hunkeler 2015 delbart et al 2016 schuler et al 2020 it is related to the storage capacity of an aquifer chiaudani et al 2019 fiorillo et al 2015 garﬁas soliz et al 2010 and is particularly high in systems in which the base flow component is prevalent pulido bosch et al 1995 as for the tirino river spring fig 9b 4 3 observed decrease in recharge and possible simplified future scenarios the results obtained from the calculated water budget of the last 20 years 2001 2020 show an average recharge of 606 mm y for tur 558 mm y for thr and 594 mm y for apr including approximately 17 due to the contribution of snowmelt previous studies have also estimated the average net infiltration feeding the gran sasso aquifer using both direct boni et al 1986 and indirect methods scozzafava and tallini 2001 boni et al 1986 estimated an effective infiltration of approximately 700 mm y assuming that the annual spring discharge is equivalent to aquifer recharge in contrast the values obtained by scozzafava and tallini 2001 using the modified thornthwaite method estimated a recharge value of 506 mm y representing approximately 53 of the average annual rainfall 945 mm y snow contribution is not included in their budget analysis in our study the long term 2000 2020 calculated average recharge on monthly basis thr corresponds to 462 mm y which is approximately 48 of the average annual rainfall 955 mm y considering the comparable values of rainfall recorded in the study period 1 difference with respect to scozzafava and tallini 2001 monthly analysis a reduction of approximately 9 of recharge value has been inferred during the last 20 years this finding suggests an increase in the etr component on water balance during the last twenty years probably due to an increase in temperature as a possible effect of incoming climate change as stated in recent research papers and reports hartmann et al 2017 for carbonate rock aquifers simulated that for the end of the century 2080 2099 in european mountain regions a decrease in annual precipitation of approximately 14 an increase in temperature of 4 9 c and an increase in high rainfall events of 8 are expected the occurrence of the abovementioned conditions results in a decrease of 28 of infiltration with respect to the average current values of 500 mm y the last intergovernmental panel on climate change report includes future scenarios on climate change effects in detail for the mediterranean area in the next 30 years an increase in the temperature of approximately 1 5 3 c is predicted coupled with a decrease in rainfall and a shortening of the snow season that would start 2 4 weeks later and end 5 weeks earlier than the 1992 2012 average these changes would obviously also imply some change in the recharge of the studied aquifer and in its water budget applying a simplified scenario based on the ipcc report intergovernmental panel on climate change 2021 it is possible to assume a present and future modification of the recharge rate involving the gran sasso aquifer therefore a simple modified scenario has been applied to tur and thr for the period 2010 2020 and for 2020 one of the driest periods recorded in the last 20 years the aim of these simulations is to verify whether the observed reduction in recharge is in line with expected climate scenarios we do not intend to preview the real future spring discharge of the aquifer but only verify the consistency of observed changes and potential climate scenarios specifically the simulated scenario data include a rise in temperature of 1 5 c conservative condition and a shortening of the snow season which starts three weeks later late november and ends five weeks earlier late march in a conservative approach to the ipcc scenario no change in average rainfall was applied comparisons of the real and modified scenarios named ipcc tur and ipcc thr are summarized in tables 3 and 4 both the ipcc tur and ipcc thr show an increase in etr with a corresponding decrease in infiltration values in detail for the simulated scenario of the 2010 2020 monitoring period the ipcc tur shows an increase in etr of approximately 5 and a similar consequent decrease in infiltration the ipcc thr shows an increase in etr of 11 and a decrease in infiltration to 13 in line with hartmann et al s 2017 calculation moreover the future scenario indicates that the snowfall component would decrease by more than 50 strongly influencing the total recharge which would decrease by 14 in ipcc tur and by 22 in ipcc thr this is due to the shortening of the snow season which erases the contributions of snow recharge at least in november and april the differences in recharge for this future scenario are higher in ipcc thr than in ipcc tur this is most likely due to the monthly increase in temperature which strongly influences the etr and infiltration estimation in both the cold and warm seasons for the driest conditions applied to real 2020 data the ipcc tur scenario shows an increase in etr of approximately 10 while infiltration decreases by approximately 11 the ipcc thr scenario highlights an increase in etr of approximately 3 and a decrease in infiltration and recharge of approximately 8 in both cases the snow recharge decreases by 40 in this scenario there are no significant changes when applying either method revealing a limited sensitivity of recharge value estimation by different methods in extreme conditions such as drought periods the application of the ipcc scenarios at the two different time periods when adopting the most conservative conditions limited changes in temperature no changes in rainfall confirms the outlook of a strong reduction in recharge due to snowmelt coupled with a smaller but significant decrease in total recharge especially in the 2010 2020 scenario the variations obtained from the last decade analyses 2010 2020 highlight the potential sensitivity of the gran sasso aquifer to climate variations both on going and potentially incoming in the future this aspect focuses on a possible decrease in groundwater resource availability which leads to a comprehensive review of resource management both in terms of drinking and other purposes 5 conclusion recharge evaluation in carbonate fractured and karstified aquifers is usually applied to wide hydrogeological basins or to single spring catchments with reference to mean values of effective infiltration nevertheless climate change effects and more widespread global changes including human pressures such as withdrawals are modifying the water budget of aquifers affecting the total amount of renewable groundwater resources while for single spring catchments an updated evaluation of these resources is not difficult by hydrograph decomposition and or tracer tests at a larger aquifer scale the shift to a distributed water budget analysis is mandatory to obtain representative values of effective recharge with time in this study an accurate analysis has been performed recalculating the precipitation distributed with elevation by 100 100 m cells on a total area of more than 1000 km2 at annual and monthly scales the last twenty years 2001 2020 have been considered separating rainfall and snowmelt contributions to recharge to limit the influence of the water budget method three separate analyses were carried out from the same input data at the annual scale the turc formula was applied tur while at the monthly scale the thornthwaite method was selected thr a third method based on geological parameters aplis apr was adopted to ensure independence from empirical formulas the obtained results offer several insights and perspectives for the future management of groundwater resources as summarized below aquifer recharges calculated by the three different methods are similar when assessing for the reliability of the results yearly mean infiltration ranges from 558 thr to 606 mm y tur with a method incidence lower than 10 apr results in 594 mm y the snowmelt contribution to recharge seems to be significant reaching 98 mm y and is heavily dependent on the snow coverage distribution with space elevation and its persistence with time the lowest snowmelt recharge accounted for 1 0 m3 s approximately 30 mm y in 2020 while the maximum input for 2010 resulted in 5 3 m3 s approximately 160 mm y recharge variability during the twenty years 2001 2020 considered is noteworthy ranging from a maximum higher than 800 mm y 2013 to minimum values of approximately 300 mm y 2006 2007 and 2020 this high variability of infiltration 100 with years confirms the need to assess the annual water budget instead of assuming mean recharge values to improve water resource management and to promote the adaptation of withdrawals to the natural oscillation of aquifer recharge recharge is obviously dependent on the ridge elevation but it has been clarified that the influence of high elevation areas increases during drought periods conversely these areas have a limited impact in rainy years when low elevation carbonate outcrops are able to contribute as much as the high elevation areas to the infiltration process comparing calculated recharge with real spring discharge allows us to underline the resilience of the groundwater resources in the studied aquifer in fact discharge values are usually slightly higher than yearly calculated recharge for all methods the overflow observed at springs with respect to calculated recharge is relevant for years affected by drought or at least low average infiltration years testifying to a possible memory effect of the carbonate aquifer evident at the base flow springs this response confirms the aquifer hydrodynamic conditions which favour a fracture network groundwater flow with respect to fast flow due to karst features predominantly observed in high elevation springs and or during high recharge periods the natural resilience of groundwater flow is confirmed by the correlation of calculated recharge with delayed discharge at the south eastern boundaries of the regional aquifer the major springs fed by baseflow show a recharge discharge correlation with a one to two year delay in response such baseflow discharge allows the aquifer to compensate for a period of drought with a limited recharge rate but at the same time the aquifer risks recording a delayed extreme shortage in discharge conditions after a low recharge period these findings which offer an updated evaluation of both recharge amount and recharge discharge mechanisms have been used to build simple future scenarios considering the potential risk of climate change effects on the infiltration values and have obtained the following two main results a conservative scenario based on limited expected changes 1 5 c and no rainfall depletion highlights a significant reduction in rainfall recharge with negative effects on discharge 5 to 13 for an average year based on 2010 2020 data and similar depletion for a drought year using 2020 data consequently a decreasing trend in infiltration is possible which most likely has been ongoing for the last twenty years when looking at the calculated infiltration for 2001 2020 which is lower than reference values based on 20th century data a dramatic shortage in recharge due to snow cover reduction and snowmelt contribution is more than a possibility built scenarios show more than 50 in snow recharge for average periods and approximately 40 for driest years when snow infiltration is still limited deeply affecting the expected total discharge of the aquifer reaching 14 22 with respect to actual conditions in summary this study reveals that the renewable rate of groundwater resources even under favourable hydrodynamic conditions with high resilience of baseflow discharge is expected to significantly decrease in the future under conservative scenarios without changes in rainfall temperature increases and the consequent reduction in the contribution of snow to aquifer recharge are significant pressures representing an elevated challenge for renewable groundwater resources and related human uses in regional carbonate fractured aquifers located in the main ridges such as the gran sasso mountains the awareness of such a concrete risk requires immediate optimization measures reflecting on the importance of water management in reducing vulnerability to climate change practically withdrawals from wells would be modulated within seasons and years in addition following the worst scenario and only if necessary to preserve the environmental value of the territory included in a national park also spring withdrawals would be limited at least in drought periods it is time to disprove the legend of endless water resources knowledge of recharge discharge conditions can prevent potential emergency conditions and the resulting relevant and unjustified expenses required to cope with future expected reductions in

7973,study region carbonate karstified aquifers represent one of the most important groundwater reservoirs for both drinking purposes and environmental preservation currently the recharge discharge equilibrium in these aquifers is at risk of depletion from withdrawal increases and global change effects based on these factors detailed analyses of recharge distribution over the last 20 years 2001 2020 both in terms of rainfall and snow melting contributions have been carried out for the gran sasso regional aquifer central italy study focus using the same input data water budgets at different time scales were calculated using the turc thornthwaite and aplis methods in addition simplified future scenarios considering the real risk of climate change effects have been implemented by applying an increase in temperature and a shortage of snow coverage periods new hydrological insights the obtained aquifer recharge values are similar and a significant contribution to recharge from snowmelt has also been highlighted the measured spring discharge values are higher with respect to the calculated recharge especially in drought periods underlining the resilience of groundwater resources in the gran sasso aquifer these values are also confirmed by the different responses of spring discharge to recharge variations a significant decrease in recharge and consequently in baseflow discharge

amount of renewable and long term resources stored in aquifers bakalowicz 2005 kaufmann 2016 among hydrogeological systems fractured and karstified carbonate rocks have a main role in hosting groundwater both in terms of diffuse and concentrated infiltration and of spring discharge with infiltration rates close to the precipitation amount both in humid and arid conditions berthelin et al 2020 such karst aquifer outcrops cover more than 20 of european territory and their springs supply water to several large cities and their citizens chen 2017 stevanović 2019 in addition the european and mediterranean karst aquifers are frequently concentrated in mountain ridges and peaks where they receive relevant to their elevation the highest rate of precipitation including snow contribution persistent on soil for several months all these characteristics coupled with peculiar groundwater dual flow by karst conduits and by fracture network increase the relevance for evaluating groundwater resource amounts withdrawal management and effective recharge rates over time in light of the effects of the normal seasonal and yearly variations of precipitation inputs hartmann et al 2021 for all these reasons fractured and karstified aquifers must be considered strategic to appropriately developing human society and maintaining environmental quality at the global level but especially at the mediterranean scale the recharge discharge equilibrium in groundwater systems threatened by human withdrawals since at least the last century is now under additional risk of depletion due to climate change which undoubtedly modifies the recharge and discharge mechanisms as demonstrated by several recent studies xanke and liesch 2022 chen et al 2018 hartmann et al 2014 2017 intergovernmental panel on climate change 2019 kundzewicz et al 2008 this is notably relevant for karst aquifers which are particularly susceptible to climate change impacts taylor and greene 2008 consequently the balance between natural renewable resources and human needs for drinking and civil purposes has to be rediscussed and where necessary adapted to ensure the maintenance of appropriate water resource amounts and of ecosystem survival for future generations this is necessary to achieve sustainable management of karst groundwater resources faced with reduced recharge and increased groundwater use therefore water planners require improved and specifically adapted tools for the management of karst water resources based on this framework the karma project granted under the prima call horizon 2020 programme of the european union prima 2018 achieves substantial progress in the hydrogeological understanding and sustainable management of karst water resources across several scales from hydrogeological basin to catchment of a single spring to obtain valuable information notably for stakeholders on recharge groundwater vulnerability and groundwater dependent ecosystems for the entire mediterranean area ollivier et al 2020 our research group concentrated on central italy where most groundwater resources are hosted by large fractured and partially karstified aquifers reaching the extent of approximately one thousand of km2 receiving rainfall amounts higher than 1000 mm year with a mean infiltration of approximately 700 mm year and corresponding to the major ridges of the territory which are frequently located at elevations higher than 2000 m asl the paradigmatic example of such aquifers is the gran sasso mountain which includes the highest peak of central italy approximately 3000 m asl and the lowest latitude european glacier known as calderone grunewald and scheithauer 2010 pecci et al 2008 tallini et al 2013 and which is expected to disappear in a few years in this paper we present the results of an updated water balance evaluation for the gran sasso aquifer and its springs with the double aim a to distribute the recharge rate to small recharge areas instead of considering a mean value and to evaluate the infiltration distribution with altitude and snow cover and b to verify the potential trend of recharge during the last twenty years the obtained results have practical applications on the one hand to provide updated information to drinking water companies and local authorities and to improve water management in order to optimize the use of available water resources at the aquifer scale and on the other hand to offer an example of possible impacts of climate change effects on groundwater resources to be extended in similar contexts in italy and at the mediterranean scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrogeological setting the gran sasso aquifer has been studied in detail over the last 25 years adinolfi falcone et al 2008 2012 amoruso et al 2011 2013 2014 barbieri et al 2005 boni et al 1986 de luca et al 2016 farroni et al 1999 ferracuti et al 2006 and its mean infiltration rate has been evaluated to be approximately 700 mm year the gran sasso hydrostructure is defined as a calcareous karstic aquifer system with a total extension of approximately 1000 km2 and it can be considered the most representative karst aquifer of the central southern apennines fig 1 at a glance the gran sasso hydrogeological system as described in amoruso et al 2013 is characterised by meso cenozoic carbonate units that host the aquifer bounded along the northern side by terrigenous units miocene flysch representing the regional aquiclude and along the southern side by quaternary continental deposits regional aquitard the gran sasso massif is characterized by the typical karst features of the central apennines where active plio quaternary tectonics have caused the recent ﬁlling of intramontane plains and river valleys by clastic and alluvial deposits cavinato and de celles 1999 the deposition of alluvial sediments precluded karst system evolution in the saturated zone causing the development of mature karst features in recharge areas that are not reflected in discharge areas barbieri et al 2005 at the massif core an endorheic basin with a tectonic karst origin called campo imperatore mean elevation 1650 m a s l acts as a preferential recharge area of the gran sasso aquifer and is fed by high rainfall and snowfall rates tallini et al 2013 the gran sasso karst aquifer hosts a unique regional wide groundwater table with a mean hydraulic gradient of 5 20 amoruso et al 2013 the aquifer has a total discharge ranging from 18 m3 s to 25 m3 s from its springs including a highway tunnel drainage tapped for drinking water on both sides the spring discharge influenced by the recharge rate is showing during last five years some lowering testified by the drinking supply companies tapping the springs the peculiarity of the gran sasso aquifer is also due to the high percentage of spring withdrawals for drinking purposes and its position inside the gran sasso and laga mts national park testifying to the dual need of providing for the human population without compromising the environment and the ecosystems however the very distinctive characteristic of the gran sasso aquifer is its groundwater drainage by two parallel tunnels drilled approximately 50 years ago to realize a highway which intercepts approximately 1 5 m3 s of groundwater close to 1000 m asl modifying the natural setting of the aquifer and inducing the discharge reduction of some springs adinolfi falcone et al 2008 amoruso et al 2013 celico et al 2005 the tunnels are still active and represent an unusual potential source of contamination to groundwater because they are tapped immediately beneath the road by lateral drainages at the aquifer core this unique interference is compounded by the presence within the highway tunnels of the noteworthy underground laboratories of the nuclear physics national institute these conditions cause the temporary suspension of the european rule for drinking water safeguard zones european commission 2000 2007 in tapping tunnel drainages throughout the aquifer approximately 25 of its renewable resources are tapped for drinking purposes mainly from springs including highway tunnel drainage and limited by well withdrawals 2 2 water balance calculation and parameter estimation the evaluation of the gran sasso rainfall has been carried out by considering two annual gradients for the northern and southern slopes of the massif scozzafava and tallini 2001 the gradients were calculated by linear correlation of altitude and climatic parameter data rainfall temperature snow acquired by 21 gran sasso thermorain gauges over a period of 20 years 2001 2020 the campotosto and assergi gauges respectively p1 and p2 in fig 1 table 1 have been considered as reference data for both northern and southern slopes the gradients were then applied from the selected gauges identifying rainfall distribution values over the entire aquifer for each year in addition the average rainfall values were derived from data from the entire monitoring period 2001 2020 by applying the two calculated gradients annual maps of rainfall distribution and isohyets were created from 2001 to 2020 and for the average year fig 2a using arcgis 10 3 software with a 100 100 m pixel raster the adopted reference system of coordinates is wgs 1984 utm zone 33 n the analysed area extends approximately 1034 km2 the elevation map was derived by the digital elevation model dem fig 2b an estimation of the temperature gradient and the related isotherm maps have also been computed by linear correlation among all existing gauges and applying the obtained gradient with respect to the castel del monte gauge selected as reference starting point p3 in fig 1 table 1 through the analysis of data the net infiltration and consequently the gran sasso water budget were computed using three different approaches the turc 1954 thornthwaite thornthwaite and mather 1957 and aplis andreo et al 2008 methods to verify the reliability of the three methods for recharge assessment the turc method tur for the estimation of real evapotranspiration etr at the yearly scale turc 1954 has been applied to assess the net inflow values the effective infiltration of the gran sasso aquifer has also been calculated at the monthly scale for the solar year starting in january by applying the thornthwaite method thr and modified to discriminate between runoff and net infiltration by applying the soil curve numbers dilshad and peel 1994 for different recharge areas inside the aquifer the maximum water storage in the soil adopted as the field capacity value has been associated with each curve number as described by scozzafava and tallini 2001 by this method the role of unsaturated soil in influencing the etr has also been considered it is noteworthy that most of the recharge area has negligible or very limited soil thickness due to direct rock outcrops which frequently occur in karst regions the modified thornthwaite method has been applied to obtain the different parameters useful to determine the infiltration value such as etp etr and field capacity and to assess the monthly water budget consequently the annual rainfall gradient ga calculated as previously discussed has been considered as a starting point to derive the monthly rainfall gradients gm by 1 1 g m i rm i ra i ga where i 1 12 month gm is the unknown variable rm is the monthly rainfall and ra is the annual rainfall scozzafava and tallini 2001 in other words monthly rainfall gradients have been obtained considering the ratio between monthly rainfall and total rainfall of each gauge both the above described methods are based on the hydrological budget equation expressed by incoming and outgoing volumes 2 2 i p etr r the runoff parameter r according to scozzafava and tallini 2001 has been considered to be approximately 0 3 of the total rainfall the negligible role of runoff in carbonate fractured and karstified aquifers of central italy has been well known and consolidated for a long time boni et al 1986 in addition to the described methodologies based on climatic parameters the aplis method apr has been applied to directly estimate the mean annual recharge of carbonate aquifers expressed as a percentage of precipitation andreo et al 2008 a combination of geological geographic and morphologic variables such as altitude a slope p lithology l infiltration landforms i soil types s and a correction factor fh dependent on hydrogeologic behaviour is used for the evaluation in addition to input parameters such as average annual rainfall and its spatial distribution see fig 2a to obtain a map of the average recharge rate available information is transformed into dimensionless values from 1 to 10 by a ranking system and subsequently used in the following eq 3 3 r a p 3x l 2x i s 0 9 fℎ where the weight of each parameter is intended to represent its relevance to the recharge rate the lithology l has a triple influence as those of altitude a slope p and soil type s while areas of preferential infiltration i are twice as important the obtained annual recharge rate was grouped into five recharge classes in addition apr allows us to obtain maps of the spatial distribution of recharge by the superimposition of the following gis information layers slope dem map in fig 2b based on a 20 20 m cell and a lithological hydrogeological map different scores have been assigned to each lithology based mainly on their fracturing and karstification the lithology score ranges from 10 to 2 assigned to the aquifer and to the aquiclude respectively even the area of campo imperatore defined as a preferential recharge area has been identified with the maximum score areas of preferential infiltration were downloaded from the geomorphological map of pai a regional management tool https autoritabacini regione abruzzo it index php carta geomorfologica pai the soil map was derived from the geoportal of the abruzzo region the main geometric reference from which the land use limits were taken was represented by the 1997 aima digital orthophoto scale 1 10000 and landsat tm5 satellite images 30 30 m pixels the last calculated parameter is the recharge correction factor fh which depends on the hydrogeological characteristics of the rock outcrops and is expressed as a percentage of precipitation a combinatory procedure has been applied to produce a single calculation algorithm that enables the determination of the recharge percentage resulting from apr application among 100 100 m rasters for the whole domain the isohyet map fig 2a has been overlapped with the aplis map to obtain the infiltration and recharge rate of the aquifer the gran sasso aquifer water budget and recharge rate depend not only on rainfall but also on seasonal snow cover and related snowmelt contributions to infiltration fazzini and bisci 1999 to calculate the snowmelt fraction a monthly gradient was applied through a linear correlation between the altitude and the monthly snowfall sum for the 1960 1990 period where available p1 and p4 in fig 1 and table 1 in other words a literature snow gradient fazzini and bisci 1999 has been applied considering the real data measured at the two reference stations p1 and p4 and consequently deriving the snow thickness value at higher and lower elevations by this way a snow coverage function of the elevation has been obtained for each snowing month november to april with related snow thickness increasing with elevation the obtained monthly gradients were then used to identify the fraction of recharge due to snow for the 2010 2020 period when snow data from campo imperatore p4 in fig 1 and table 1 were available in this case snow evaluation was based on the hydrological year starting since november until april of the following solar year due to the absence of real snowfall data for the 2001 2009 period the snowmelt contribution was estimated for this period as 15 of the recharge applying a precautionary rate with respect to the 20 obtained from real data during the 2010 20 period this additional recharge contribution has been applied to the infiltration calculated by all three methods tur etr apr for each observation year and on average equally spreading the snow recharge during the three snow melting months of march april and may 2 3 main spring discharge data analyses to compare the water balance calculated through the different methods and to evaluate the springs response to aquifer recharge variations discharge data for the main springs have been collected and analysed discharge data for the monitoring period 2001 2020 have been provided mostly by water suppliers and the regional environmental agency and then coupled with data obtained during previous research projects adinolfi falcone et al 2012 amoruso et al 2011 information on spring discharge has been collected at different time scales from hourly to seasonal scales depending on the purposes of monitoring most of the spring data are unfortunately not continuous for the analysed period missing information has been derived starting from the known discharge measures and estimated as the average of the available data in case of missing discharge data for the whole year the spring discharge has been assumed from the correlation line equation obtained comparing real known spring discharge with the expected discharge obtained from the tur water balance calculation by this way a reasonable discharge value has been assigned to the years with missing data of single springs the acquired data were checked and validated the real mean discharges calculated for the 2001 2020 period for each spring are summarized in table 2 and consider each observation solar year 3 results the calculated gradients of both rainfall and temperature have been applied to the whole domain the computed annual rainfall gradients are 30 mm 100 m for the southern slope and 42 mm 100 m for the northern slope the obtained temperature gradient was 0 59 c 100 m the benchmark for snow monitoring was the campo imperatore gauge s4 in fig 1 and table 1 and the applied monthly gradients corresponded to 3 8 cm 100 m for november 4 2 cm 100 m for december 6 7 cm 100 m for january 3 3 cm 100 m for february 2 4 cm 100 m for march and 4 9 cm 100 m in april consequently snow coverage on the aquifer and its thickness have been obtained in each 100 100 cell for the entire period with real data 2010 2020 the snow fall has been converted in equivalent mm of rain 1 cm of snow 1 mm of rain considering a negligible contribution to runoff 0 3 of total rainfall the net infiltration was calculated using the three previously mentioned methods details are included in the supplementary file tables s1 s3 3 1 turc method tur the average annual recharge calculated over the 20 year period using the turc method tur is 19 9 m3 s including a contribution due to snowmelt of 3 2 m3 s the average etr value is approximately 444 mm y while the average infiltration value from rainfall corresponds to 508 mm y which is integrated with 98 mm y due to snowmelt the year 2007 shows the lowest recharge of 11 5 m3 s 10 m3 s from rainfall and 1 5 m3 s from snowmelt while 2013 has the highest recharge of 30 7 m3 s 26 m3 s from rainfall and 4 7 m3 s from snowmelt fig 3 shows the calculated recharge including the snowmelt component differently calculated for 2001 2009 15 of recharge and 2010 2020 from real data 3 2 thornthwaite method thr using the thornthwaite method thr the calculated average annual recharge results in approximately 18 5 m3 s including a contribution from snowmelt of 3 2 m3 s the average value of etr is approximately 491 mm y while the corresponding infiltration value is 558 mm y 2006 was the driest year with a recharge of 9 8 m3 s of which 8 5 m3 s was from rainfall and 1 3 m3 s was from snowmelt while 2013 had the highest recharge of 27 2 m3 s 22 6 m3 s was from rainfall and 4 7 m3 s was from snowmelt the main results are summarized in fig 4 3 3 aplis method apr through the aplis method apr the gran sasso aquifer recharge rates are predominantly moderate with an effective infiltration percentage of 51 6 of the total rainfall the gran sasso massif according to apr is characterized by a preferential recharge area the campo imperatore basin with an infiltration rate of 76 7 fig 5 the concentrated infiltration phenomena are due to the combination of different relevant parameters such as the carbonate complex outcrop fracture density scarce vegetation cover and limited soil thickness however in limited areas near the boundaries the presence of low permeability deposits reduces recharge to low 20 40 and very low 20 levels fig 5 allogenic contributions are considered negligible according with a very limited contribution by runoff 0 3 of total rainfall the aquifer recharge through direct infiltration was calculated by overlaying the obtained recharge rate map with the rainfall map obtained for each year the average recharge rate is 19 4 m3 s 3 2 m3 s from snowmelt and 16 2 m3 s from rainfall and the equivalent average infiltration value is 594 mm y 496 mm y from rainfall and 98 mm y from snowmelt for tur 2007 is characterized by a minimum recharge rate of 13 7 m3 s 11 9 m3 s from rainfall and 1 8 m3 s from snowmelt while for tur and thr 2013 is characterized by the highest recharge rate of 21 3 m3 s including recharge due to snowmelt of 4 7 m3 s fig 6 3 4 main spring discharge data to verify the consistency of the estimated recharge values a comparison with the discharge data of the main springs fig 1 and table 2 of the same 2000 2020 period was carried out the capo pescara spring the largest spring located in the south eastern corner of the aquifer has not been included because it is fed by both the sirente and gran sasso aquifers with a prevailing contribution from the sirente aquifer scozzafava and tallini 2001 petitta and tallini 2002 as shown in fig 1 a groundwater seepage from the sirente aquifer towards the capo pescara spring s9 is certified recent studies stoch et al 2016 suggest that capo pescara discharge is fed prominently from the sirente aquifer with a minority contribution from gran sasso aquifer due to the impossibility to quantitatively assess the gran sasso aliquot of the discharge its contribution to the water budget has been neglected accepting an underestimation of the total discharge of the gran sasso aquifer the total long term mean discharge of the aquifer corresponds to 20 4 m3 s the springs of the tirino valley s7 and s8 including minor streambed springs are characterized by a consistent and constant discharge over time accounting for approximately 60 of the total gran sasso spring discharge 4 discussion 4 1 recharge evaluation comparison the reliability and representativity of the different applied methodologies can be assessed by comparing the results obtained through the three approaches both in terms of recharge values and their distribution in the study area the analysis was conducted on both rainfall recharge values and total recharge rainfall snowmelt results the calculated mean rainfall recharge and related standard deviation sd are 16 7 4 2 m3 s for tur 15 3 3 9 m3 s for thr and 16 2 2 4 m3 s for apr showing a difference among mean values lower than calculated standard deviations 1 5 m3 s in addition for tur and apr 1 sd includes 75 of the calculated values while for thr it includes 70 of the values highlighting the adequate representativity and accuracy of the adopted methods the same analysis carried out on total recharge values rainfall snowmelt for the 2010 2020 period shows mean sd values of 21 3 5 2 m3 s 19 3 5 1 m3 s and 20 6 3 4 m3 s for tur thr and apr respectively differences among mean values are confirmed to be lower than calculated standard deviations and the mean 1 sd includes 73 of obtained results for tur and apr and 64 for thr the comparability of the adopted approaches has been tested by matching results among different methods in detail the comparison between rainfall recharge values shows an r2 of 0 74 comparing thr and apr and an r2 of 0 83 comparing thr and tur while the tur apr correlation line indicates the highest r2 of 0 94 probably due to the same annual scale basis looking at total recharge values 2010 2020 monitoring period the obtained r2 values are 0 92 between tur and thr 0 97 between tur and apr and 0 89 between thr and apr the increase in correlation considering the total recharge including the snow effect supports the hypothesis of significant contributions from snow to recharge at the same time the correlation increase also indirectly testifies to the representativity of the approach adopted for snow recharge estimation by all methods a higher recharge value was recorded in 2013 while the driest years were recognized in the two year periods 2006 07 and 2011 12 in addition a common decreasing trend in recharge values has been identified from 2014 to 2020 with the only exception recorded in 2018 where measured rainfall values were higher as in other areas of central italy lancia et al 2020 sappa et al 2019 the analyses of the values obtained through apr highlight that recharge distribution is strongly dependent on the elevation belt despite lithology and infiltration landforms having weights of 3 and 2 respectively in the aplis formula the medium low altitude belts unlike the tur and thr results seem to be strongly influenced by recharge variations especially in drought years conversely the high altitude belts guarantee even with different weights the highest recharge rates confirming the results of the tur and thr recharge distribution analyses the role of high elevation areas in aquifer recharge processes becomes even more important considering the influence of snow coverage and consequent melting as mentioned in the previous paragraphs the contribution of snow melting to the water balance has been calculated using real data only for recent years 2010 2020 when it was found that 60 of snow recharge comes from altitudes higher than 1400 m a s l while the remaining 40 arrives from elevations ranging between 600 m and 1400 m a s l 4 2 total spring discharge and computed recharge analysis to verify the reliability of the recharge values obtained with the application of different methods the real total spring discharge tsd and the recharge values gathered from the three methods tur thr apr were compared to assess tsd all major springs were considered see fig 1 and paragraph 3 4 covering close to 100 of the total aquifer discharge fig 7 shows the comparison between the annual values of recharge obtained by the three applied methods and the measured discharge of the aquifer in principle recharge represents the annual renewable resources in an aquifer while discharge is expected to fit only partially with recharge values due to the storage parameter in the hydrological budget nevertheless karst aquifers usually show a fast response to recharge inputs and consequently for this case study a high correlation between recharge and discharge values at the annual scale is expected in fact tur and tsd values are well correlated r2 0 86 fig 7l showing a slight overestimation of tur with respect to tsd for the rainy years when tur 22 5 m3 s and a slight underestimation for drought years a similar match r2 0 85 was obtained by tsd and recharge calculated with thr fig 7c in this case a general underestimation of thr with respect to tsd was observed which was more evident in the driest years the comparison between apr and tsd shows the best alignment with respect to the xy line fig 7r but with a lower correlation r2 0 81 confirming a slight underestimation trend of apr with respect to tsd the three comparisons in fig 7 highlight that aquifer discharge is higher than the calculated stored recharge of the same year the reason for this finding can be attributed to different causes an underestimation of aquifer recharge due to the adopted procedure for rainfall and snow contributions could be one cause we cannot exclude this possibility but this condition is more clearly evident for years with a low recharge rate and the applied methods for recharge assessment are the same for all years an overestimation of aquifer discharge due to input to springs from different hydrogeological basins could be another cause we exclude this possibility due to several studies based on hydrochemistry and isotope data indicating that no external recharge areas can affect the gran sasso spring discharge a third possibility the most reliable in our opinion is the so called memory effect which is able to modulate the response of the springs to meteoric recharge fiorillo and doglioni 2010 frequently occurring in regional karst aquifers in other words during years having a limited recharge rate the spring discharge is sustained not only by the corresponding recharge input which is directly connected with the karst system but also by a significant and persistent base flow which is due to the circulation in the secondary fracture network and matrix porosity enhancing the role of the aquifer storage capacity this memory effect would be more evident including in the tsd the contribution from capo pescara spring s9 we initially discarded going deeper into the recharge discharge comparison process the annual mean discharge referred to each of the considered main springs belonging to the gran sasso aquifer has been compared with the total recharge calculated with tur the analyses of the trend over time of tur and single spring discharge allowed classification into three groups depending on the observed correlation specifically the five main springs show a significant correlation with respect to tur r2 0 45 three are characterized by a limited match with an r2 ranging between 0 25 and 0 45 while five seem to be unrelated to recharge variation r2 0 25 as stated in section 2 3 the strong heterogeneity in real spring discharge available data sometimes incomplete for the considered period surely affects the obtained correlation values in addition the analyses of annual recharge discharge correlation clearly highlight the different responses of springs pointing out immediate or time delayed responses with respect to computed recharge variations at the annual scale the discharge of springs located on the northern side of the gran sasso massif s1 to s6 in fig 1 shows a fast response to annual recharge variations tur a clear example is represented by the rio arno spring s2 in fig 1 fed by the top level of the aquifer tallini et al 2014 in fact as shown in fig 8 the annual rio arno spring discharge blue dots follows the variation observed for tur orange bars years characterized by high recharge rates are reflected on high spring discharge values and vice versa as confirmed by an r2 of 0 54 in contrast springs monitored on the southern side s7 s13 in fig 1 reflect the variation in aquifer recharge with some delay in fact the southern drainage discharge of the highway tunnel s10 in fig 1 seems to follow the effect of the variations in aquifer recharge with a year delay fig 9a reflecting the effect of a rainy or dry year by an increase or decrease in annual discharge one year later consequently in comparing tur and discharge data the r2 significantly increases from a value of 0 30 to a value of 0 56 applying spring discharge values to the previous year calculated recharge the delay is more evident at the tirino river s9 in fig 1 whereby the annual tur value shows its effects with approximately a two year delay fig 9b the comparison between spring discharge and tur highlights that no correlation r2 0 01 is obtained comparing data without applying any delay in spring response while r2 increases to 0 44 when comparing discharge values to recharge from two years prior these results are consistent with the conceptual regional model of groundwater flow petitta and tallini 2002 tallini et al 2013 2014 where tirino river springs s9 in fig 1 are supplied by the regional aquifer and are characterized by a steady state regime considering the hydrogeological features of this spring the observed delay recorded in its disdose response to variations in aquifer recharge is in agreement with the hypothesis as mentioned above of the memory effect the memory effect is widely used to assess the response of groundwater in karst systems massei et al 2006 mayaud et al 2019 meeks and hunkeler 2015 delbart et al 2016 schuler et al 2020 it is related to the storage capacity of an aquifer chiaudani et al 2019 fiorillo et al 2015 garﬁas soliz et al 2010 and is particularly high in systems in which the base flow component is prevalent pulido bosch et al 1995 as for the tirino river spring fig 9b 4 3 observed decrease in recharge and possible simplified future scenarios the results obtained from the calculated water budget of the last 20 years 2001 2020 show an average recharge of 606 mm y for tur 558 mm y for thr and 594 mm y for apr including approximately 17 due to the contribution of snowmelt previous studies have also estimated the average net infiltration feeding the gran sasso aquifer using both direct boni et al 1986 and indirect methods scozzafava and tallini 2001 boni et al 1986 estimated an effective infiltration of approximately 700 mm y assuming that the annual spring discharge is equivalent to aquifer recharge in contrast the values obtained by scozzafava and tallini 2001 using the modified thornthwaite method estimated a recharge value of 506 mm y representing approximately 53 of the average annual rainfall 945 mm y snow contribution is not included in their budget analysis in our study the long term 2000 2020 calculated average recharge on monthly basis thr corresponds to 462 mm y which is approximately 48 of the average annual rainfall 955 mm y considering the comparable values of rainfall recorded in the study period 1 difference with respect to scozzafava and tallini 2001 monthly analysis a reduction of approximately 9 of recharge value has been inferred during the last 20 years this finding suggests an increase in the etr component on water balance during the last twenty years probably due to an increase in temperature as a possible effect of incoming climate change as stated in recent research papers and reports hartmann et al 2017 for carbonate rock aquifers simulated that for the end of the century 2080 2099 in european mountain regions a decrease in annual precipitation of approximately 14 an increase in temperature of 4 9 c and an increase in high rainfall events of 8 are expected the occurrence of the abovementioned conditions results in a decrease of 28 of infiltration with respect to the average current values of 500 mm y the last intergovernmental panel on climate change report includes future scenarios on climate change effects in detail for the mediterranean area in the next 30 years an increase in the temperature of approximately 1 5 3 c is predicted coupled with a decrease in rainfall and a shortening of the snow season that would start 2 4 weeks later and end 5 weeks earlier than the 1992 2012 average these changes would obviously also imply some change in the recharge of the studied aquifer and in its water budget applying a simplified scenario based on the ipcc report intergovernmental panel on climate change 2021 it is possible to assume a present and future modification of the recharge rate involving the gran sasso aquifer therefore a simple modified scenario has been applied to tur and thr for the period 2010 2020 and for 2020 one of the driest periods recorded in the last 20 years the aim of these simulations is to verify whether the observed reduction in recharge is in line with expected climate scenarios we do not intend to preview the real future spring discharge of the aquifer but only verify the consistency of observed changes and potential climate scenarios specifically the simulated scenario data include a rise in temperature of 1 5 c conservative condition and a shortening of the snow season which starts three weeks later late november and ends five weeks earlier late march in a conservative approach to the ipcc scenario no change in average rainfall was applied comparisons of the real and modified scenarios named ipcc tur and ipcc thr are summarized in tables 3 and 4 both the ipcc tur and ipcc thr show an increase in etr with a corresponding decrease in infiltration values in detail for the simulated scenario of the 2010 2020 monitoring period the ipcc tur shows an increase in etr of approximately 5 and a similar consequent decrease in infiltration the ipcc thr shows an increase in etr of 11 and a decrease in infiltration to 13 in line with hartmann et al s 2017 calculation moreover the future scenario indicates that the snowfall component would decrease by more than 50 strongly influencing the total recharge which would decrease by 14 in ipcc tur and by 22 in ipcc thr this is due to the shortening of the snow season which erases the contributions of snow recharge at least in november and april the differences in recharge for this future scenario are higher in ipcc thr than in ipcc tur this is most likely due to the monthly increase in temperature which strongly influences the etr and infiltration estimation in both the cold and warm seasons for the driest conditions applied to real 2020 data the ipcc tur scenario shows an increase in etr of approximately 10 while infiltration decreases by approximately 11 the ipcc thr scenario highlights an increase in etr of approximately 3 and a decrease in infiltration and recharge of approximately 8 in both cases the snow recharge decreases by 40 in this scenario there are no significant changes when applying either method revealing a limited sensitivity of recharge value estimation by different methods in extreme conditions such as drought periods the application of the ipcc scenarios at the two different time periods when adopting the most conservative conditions limited changes in temperature no changes in rainfall confirms the outlook of a strong reduction in recharge due to snowmelt coupled with a smaller but significant decrease in total recharge especially in the 2010 2020 scenario the variations obtained from the last decade analyses 2010 2020 highlight the potential sensitivity of the gran sasso aquifer to climate variations both on going and potentially incoming in the future this aspect focuses on a possible decrease in groundwater resource availability which leads to a comprehensive review of resource management both in terms of drinking and other purposes 5 conclusion recharge evaluation in carbonate fractured and karstified aquifers is usually applied to wide hydrogeological basins or to single spring catchments with reference to mean values of effective infiltration nevertheless climate change effects and more widespread global changes including human pressures such as withdrawals are modifying the water budget of aquifers affecting the total amount of renewable groundwater resources while for single spring catchments an updated evaluation of these resources is not difficult by hydrograph decomposition and or tracer tests at a larger aquifer scale the shift to a distributed water budget analysis is mandatory to obtain representative values of effective recharge with time in this study an accurate analysis has been performed recalculating the precipitation distributed with elevation by 100 100 m cells on a total area of more than 1000 km2 at annual and monthly scales the last twenty years 2001 2020 have been considered separating rainfall and snowmelt contributions to recharge to limit the influence of the water budget method three separate analyses were carried out from the same input data at the annual scale the turc formula was applied tur while at the monthly scale the thornthwaite method was selected thr a third method based on geological parameters aplis apr was adopted to ensure independence from empirical formulas the obtained results offer several insights and perspectives for the future management of groundwater resources as summarized below aquifer recharges calculated by the three different methods are similar when assessing for the reliability of the results yearly mean infiltration ranges from 558 thr to 606 mm y tur with a method incidence lower than 10 apr results in 594 mm y the snowmelt contribution to recharge seems to be significant reaching 98 mm y and is heavily dependent on the snow coverage distribution with space elevation and its persistence with time the lowest snowmelt recharge accounted for 1 0 m3 s approximately 30 mm y in 2020 while the maximum input for 2010 resulted in 5 3 m3 s approximately 160 mm y recharge variability during the twenty years 2001 2020 considered is noteworthy ranging from a maximum higher than 800 mm y 2013 to minimum values of approximately 300 mm y 2006 2007 and 2020 this high variability of infiltration 100 with years confirms the need to assess the annual water budget instead of assuming mean recharge values to improve water resource management and to promote the adaptation of withdrawals to the natural oscillation of aquifer recharge recharge is obviously dependent on the ridge elevation but it has been clarified that the influence of high elevation areas increases during drought periods conversely these areas have a limited impact in rainy years when low elevation carbonate outcrops are able to contribute as much as the high elevation areas to the infiltration process comparing calculated recharge with real spring discharge allows us to underline the resilience of the groundwater resources in the studied aquifer in fact discharge values are usually slightly higher than yearly calculated recharge for all methods the overflow observed at springs with respect to calculated recharge is relevant for years affected by drought or at least low average infiltration years testifying to a possible memory effect of the carbonate aquifer evident at the base flow springs this response confirms the aquifer hydrodynamic conditions which favour a fracture network groundwater flow with respect to fast flow due to karst features predominantly observed in high elevation springs and or during high recharge periods the natural resilience of groundwater flow is confirmed by the correlation of calculated recharge with delayed discharge at the south eastern boundaries of the regional aquifer the major springs fed by baseflow show a recharge discharge correlation with a one to two year delay in response such baseflow discharge allows the aquifer to compensate for a period of drought with a limited recharge rate but at the same time the aquifer risks recording a delayed extreme shortage in discharge conditions after a low recharge period these findings which offer an updated evaluation of both recharge amount and recharge discharge mechanisms have been used to build simple future scenarios considering the potential risk of climate change effects on the infiltration values and have obtained the following two main results a conservative scenario based on limited expected changes 1 5 c and no rainfall depletion highlights a significant reduction in rainfall recharge with negative effects on discharge 5 to 13 for an average year based on 2010 2020 data and similar depletion for a drought year using 2020 data consequently a decreasing trend in infiltration is possible which most likely has been ongoing for the last twenty years when looking at the calculated infiltration for 2001 2020 which is lower than reference values based on 20th century data a dramatic shortage in recharge due to snow cover reduction and snowmelt contribution is more than a possibility built scenarios show more than 50 in snow recharge for average periods and approximately 40 for driest years when snow infiltration is still limited deeply affecting the expected total discharge of the aquifer reaching 14 22 with respect to actual conditions in summary this study reveals that the renewable rate of groundwater resources even under favourable hydrodynamic conditions with high resilience of baseflow discharge is expected to significantly decrease in the future under conservative scenarios without changes in rainfall temperature increases and the consequent reduction in the contribution of snow to aquifer recharge are significant pressures representing an elevated challenge for renewable groundwater resources and related human uses in regional carbonate fractured aquifers located in the main ridges such as the gran sasso mountains the awareness of such a concrete risk requires immediate optimization measures reflecting on the importance of water management in reducing vulnerability to climate change practically withdrawals from wells would be modulated within seasons and years in addition following the worst scenario and only if necessary to preserve the environmental value of the territory included in a national park also spring withdrawals would be limited at least in drought periods it is time to disprove the legend of endless water resources knowledge of recharge discharge conditions can prevent potential emergency conditions and the resulting relevant and unjustified expenses required to cope with future expected reductions in

7974,study region west africa with a focus between 5 w and 5 e study focus the effects of changing climate and co2 concentration rcp8 5 between 2000 and 2100 on the west african monsoon are examined using the upscale high resolution 25 km global climate model ensembles for present and future climate combined with the jules land surface model new hydrological insights future climate is predicted to have an enhanced summertime saharan heat low changing large scale circulation causing monsoon rainfall generally to increase the monsoon progresses further inland and occurs later in the year upscale rainfall projections indicate that the eastern sahel becomes wetter 12 2 but the western sahel drier 13 5 future evapotranspiration is reduced across most of west africa due to the co2 fertilisation effect causing lower transpiration potential groundwater recharge soil drainage at the bottom of a 3 m deep soil column is predicted to increase from 0 to 16 of rainfall under present climate to 1 20 in the future doubling from 5 to 10 in northern ghana and the eastern sahel potential recharge increases largely due to increased soil hydraulic conductivity caused by higher soil moisture resulting from increased rainfall and reduced transpiration other factors have only a minor influence on the water balance and potential recharge including rainfall intensity and land use type a predicted increase in future potential groundwater recharge is significant as development of groundwater resources is seen as a key means to meet growing water demand in west africa keywords west african monsoon soil water balance co2 fertilisation land use change water resources 1 introduction the west african summer monsoon is caused by the saharan heat low setting up a southwest to northeast air flow from the coast to the sahel which brings moist air from the atlantic to provide rainfall from june to september each year meynadier et al 2010a 2010b marsham et al 2013 the coastal region sees a bimodal monsoon the monsoon is vital for the population of the region with the rainfall providing the seasonal influx to terrestrial water resources to support drinking water sources agricultural production and economic development coulibaly et al 2018 naabil et al 2017 ascott et al 2020 there is a substantial body of research demonstrating that characteristics of the monsoon have already changed over recent decades most of the west african rain is from mesoscale convective systems and taylor et al 2017 used satellite observations to show an increased frequency of extreme storms in the sahel between 1982 and 2016 due to an increased south north temperature gradient previously panthou et al 2014 used rain gauge data from a network of 43 stations to show sahelian rainfall has an increasing fraction of extreme rainfall defined as occurring 2 5 times per year on average at any station more recently panthou et al 2018 used a large set of daily rain gauge data 1950 onwards with 5 min rain observations from the amma catch niger observatory since 1990 to find increased mean intensity of rainy days and higher frequency of heavy rainfall in the sahel a new era of extremes since 2000 and a stronger increase in extreme rain in east sahel than in the west moreover dardel et al 2014 used the gimms 3g ndvi dataset between 1981 and 2011 and found statistically significant increases in rainfall over almost all the sahel with long term field observations showing re greening in places odoulami and akinsanola 2018 examined west african monsoon daily rainfall trends measured by gpcp and trmm during 1998 2013 finding reduced rainfall in the region of guinea and increased rainfall in the sahel bichet and diedhiou 2018 using the chirps dataset at 0 05 resolution over 1981 2014 found that the west african sahel has become wetter principally from the number of wet days 10 days compared to the normal over the entire sahel band along with an increase in intensity over the central part 3 mm day they also found that although dry spells are also becoming more frequent these are on average shorter by 30 over the entire sahel band so do not represent a reduction in rainfall and that precipitation intensity in the west senegal has decreased by around 3 mm day sacre regis et al 2020 used chirps data over 1986 2015 finding increased precipitation and more wet days in the west and central sahel various researchers have also explored how the west african monsoon is likely to change under future climate projections using both regional and global climate models global modelling studies have generally found that rainfall over west africa increases in the east with some models projecting decreases over the west maynard et al 2002 for example used the meteo france climate model arpege climate at a resolution of 312 km to predict the impact of increasing greenhouse gases and aerosols on precipitable water water vapour recycling moisture convergence and precipitation efficiency they reported an enhanced monsoon precipitation at the end of the twenty first century and changes in the position and strength of the african easterly jet and the hadley and walker circulations kamga et al 2005 compared the national center for atmospheric research ncar coupled atmosphere ocean climate system model csm simulation at 312 km resolution to long term observations and to the national centers for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis finding increases in west africa summer jja temperatures of 1 5 2 5 c between 1951 and 1980 and the late 21st century also they predicted that the sahel would likely be wetter in the late 21st century with increased atmospheric moisture stronger meridional winds from the gulf of guinea and a slightly stronger aej roehrig et al 2013 used results from the 5th climate model intercomparison project cmip5 resolutions between 0 25 and 2 8 to examine future rainfall in the sahel they found that the sahara has greater warming than land to the south and a good model consensus on reduced future precipitation in the western sahel 15 5w and increased precipitation in the east 0 30 e the gross projected patterns in west african precipitation change are similar for regional climate models rcms as for global climate models sylla et al 2015 used results from ensembles of earth system models esms and regional climate models rcms at 25 km resolution run for historical and future periods rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 to study high intensity daily precipitation events for west africa their findings showed a good match between model rainfall estimates and rainfall statistics derived from trmm and gpcp for present conditions and predicted a delay in monsoon onset in the future combined with more intense rainfall events due to stronger moisture convergence particularly in rcp8 5 and more so over the sahel than further south diallo et al 2016 modelled the future monsoon with the regional climate model regcm4 at 50 km resolution for 1970 2100 with driving data generated by hadgem2 es and mpi esm gcm global climate models under the rcp8 5 greenhouse gas concentration pathway they found changes to the african and tropical easterly jets a changing water budget with more extreme rainfall and again a drier west but a wetter east sahel todzo et al 2019 used outputs from cordex africa an ensemble of 18 high resolution 50 km regional climate projections rcp8 5 over 2006 2099 to find an intensification of the hydrological cycle in west africa they found that temperatures are expected to rise faster here than the global average rate leading to more intense but less frequent rainfall with longer dry spells at the finest spatial resolution kendon et al 2019 carried out climate change experiments with the cp4 a convection permitting high resolution 4 5 km model for the first time over the africa wide domain and projected greater future increases in extreme 3 hourly precipitation compared to a convection parameterised 25 km model but also future increases in dry spell length during the wet season over western and central africa berthou et al 2019 used results from cp4 a for the period 1997 2006 to improve simulations of the monsoon resulting in increased moisture convergence in the sahel more short lasting intense rainfall events mesoscale convective systems mcss better representation of wet and dry spells daily and sub daily and an improved diurnal cycle of rainfall which impacts the diurnal monsoon winds fitzpatrick et al 2020 used results from cp4 a rcp8 5 until 2100 and predicted a 28 increase of extreme rain rate mcss in the sahel mostly due to greater total water columns using clausius clapeyron scaling but with regional heterogeneity modulated by increased vertical wind shear when planning adaptation measures it is crucial to assess precipitation change in the context of present day variability a methodology for this is presented in gaetani et al 2020 which used 29 state of the art climate models 0 5 resolution 50 km to estimate the time of emergence toe of precipitation changes in west africa they found a clear difference between west and east sahel and a reduced occurrence of wet days likely to emerge before 2036 and a possible drier climate during 2028 2052 in the west but a wetter climate in the east with an increased occurrence of very wet days likely to emerge before 2054 increased rainfall does not necessarily lead to reduced irrigation demand sylla et al 2018 applied a 23 member ensemble of rcps 50 km resolution to assess hydrological changes for west africa under 2 c and 1 5 c global warming they found increased irrigation demand but reduced water availability in 10 major river basins in the area limiting sustainable agriculture in the 2 c scenario however impacts reduced by up to 50 in the 1 5 c scenario any changes in future climate encompassing variables such rainfall temperature and vapour pressure deficit will impact vegetation functioning moreover the concurrent changes in atmospheric co2 concentration will also play an important role in plant physiological behaviour the effects of elevated co2 concentrations on plant transpiration and water use efficiency have been known for many decades and have mainly been studied empirically using a number of laboratory in situ and remote sensing techniques as summarised in kirschbaum and mcmillan 2018 the general consensus is that photosynthesis will increase under elevated co2 concentrations while the concurrent reduction in stomatal opening in most plants will cause a reduction in transpiration xu et al 2016 the strength of this reduction will depend on climatic factors and soil water availability the projected changes in transpiration will affect rain forming processes for example mengis et al 2015 performed experiments with an intermediate complexity earth system climate model uvic escm 3 6 resolution for a range of model imposed transpiration sensitivities to co2 and found that by 2100 under a high emission scenario changing the sensitivity of transpiration to co2 caused a range of changes to the simulated terrestrial precipitation of 10 to 27 their study emphasises the importance of an improved assessment of the dynamics of environmental impact on vegetation to better predict future changes of the terrestrial hydrological and carbon cycles any future changes in rainfall amount and timing during the monsoon have implications in terms of the west african terrestrial water balance and hence for water and food security much of the region is underlain by low storage and low productive aquifers which are more susceptible to short term decreases in groundwater recharge resulting from lower rainfall than elsewhere in the continent adelana and macdonald 2008 bianchi et al 2020 changes in rainfall intensity cuthbert et al 2019 and land use change favreau et al 2009 may also affect groundwater recharge the frequently dispersed communities also often rely on small reservoirs uneca 2015 which have limited capacity and depend on more regular rainfall driven inflows in semi arid regions krol et al 2011 in terms of food production agriculture is predominantly rainfed sultan and gaetani 2016 and is highly dependent on seasonal rainfall cooper and coe 2011 this type of agriculture is the mainstay of rural livelihoods in this region and the primary source of food for the urban centres the study presented here represents a novel analysis of hydrological variability in west africa 17 w to 15 e 4 21 n using an ensemble of high resolution 25 km climate simulations upscale see section 2 1 this resolution is higher than that used in most other studies mentioned above apart from that used in the convection permitting studies previous work has shown that low resolution global coupled models represent the variability in precipitation poorly in this region because of biases in sea surface temperatures sst dunning et al 2017 and crude topography jung and kunstmann 2007 upscale in contrast captures the variability well dunning et al 2017 black et al 2021 this paper furthermore extends previous work on precipitation change e g roehrig et al 2013 by considering the full water balance at the land surface by using the upscale near surface atmospheric variables to drive the jules land surface model also the physiological impacts of climate change via increases in co2 concentration on vegetation functioning are explicitly considered along with the implications for the terrestrial water balance this effect has been little explored for west africa within the west african geographical domain we focus on a central region which includes burkina faso and ghana 5 w to 5 e where rainfall patterns and vegetation and soil are fairly constant laterally across a series of zones these zones provide a north south transect through the savanna and sahel climate zones fig 1 first we discuss the key atmospheric variables relating to the large scale circulation during the west african summer monsoon obtained from upscale for current and future climates next the resulting present and future rainfall their daily intensity and the spatial and temporal patterns of the monsoon are presented and discussed as well as the effects on the terrestrial water balance with emphasis on the partitioning of precipitation water between evapotranspiration surface runoff potential recharge soil drainage flux at the bottom of a 3 m deep soil column we use potential here because in reality some of this drainage flux may become interflow and hence will not recharge the aquifers and soil moisture storage finally the influence of vegetation cover on the present to future changes in the water balance as well as the physiological response of the vegetation to increasing co2 concentrations are analysed and discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 upscale current and future climate data in this study data were taken from the upscale uk on prace weather resolving simulations of climate for global environmental risk mizielinski et al 2014 project high resolution 25 km ensemble of climate simulations these simulations are based upon the hadgem3 global atmosphere 3 ga3 and global land 3 gl3 configurations of the uk meteorological office unified model um and the joint uk land environment simulator jules respectively as documented in walters et al 2011 the upscale simulations were forced with ostia ssts and current atmospheric co2 concentration 5 241 10 4 kg kg for present climate 5 ensemble members covering 27 years between 1985 and 2011 and with ostia ssts plus the anticipated sst change from 1990 2010 to 2090 2110 in the hadgem2 earth system run under the ipcc representative concentration pathway 8 5 climate change scenario and increased co2 concentration 1 4217 10 3 kg kg for future climate 3 ensemble members also for 27 years each co2 concentration was kept constant during each 27 year run the ensembles provide large datasets of simulated current and future climate for statistical studies the land surface is prescribed a global emissivity of 0 97 while the albedo is set by the jules land surface model the global high resolution and large number of ensemble members of upscale are expected to capture the details of the spatiotemporal distribution of atmospheric variables and large scale circulation in our case to allow for reliable simulation of the changes in the west african monsoon and terrestrial water balance under a changing climate the upscale outputs comprise a range of atmospheric outputs at different model levels in our results section we present the near surface data values for the potential evapotranspiration pet were not available from upscale and were calculated using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 for our study 2 2 off line distributed jules runs driven with upscale climate data the daily atmospheric variables from upscale were used to drive the jules land surface model best et al 2011 clark et al 2011 walters et al 2011 version 4 1 that was provided with data on vegetation cover and soil texture see fig 2 to produce model estimates of the terrestrial water balance and energy balance in west africa the driving variables are rainfall p mean air temperature diurnal air temperature range downwelling short and longwave radiation specific humidity surface pressure and wind speed jules was run across west africa in distributed fashion with 91 72 individual grid boxes between 17 w and 15 e longitude 17 w to 15 e and 4 and 21 n latitude 4 21 n the land surface model runs also allow us to study the response of plants to the changing climate and co2 concentration which will affect the water balance as well as model sensitivities with regards to vegetation type and coverage as explained below for jules the upscale daily data were disaggregated into hourly time steps for each day the total rainfall is restricted to one event of duration τ 6 h for convective rain which is placed at random in the day provided there is a dry period of at least τ hrs before the end of the day for especially extreme rainfall greater than 350 mm day τ is increased air temperature is given a diurnal cycle set by the daily mean and diurnal temperature range with the maximum temperature occurring at 0 15 of a day 3 h and 36 min after local noon the downwelling radiation values are also given diurnal cycles with longwave depending on the air temperature following stefan boltzmann s law assuming black body radiation while shortwave depends on the angle of the sun above the horizon daily specific humidity is kept constant throughout the day except if the relative humidity reaches 100 with saturated vapour pressure calculated from the hourly air temperature in which case the humidity is limited to this value during these hours and hence is not conserved both pressure and wind are kept constant throughout the day in concordance with the upscale runs atmospheric co2 was also set to 5 241 10 4 kg kg for present climate and 1 4217 10 3 kg kg for future climate although we also conducted jules runs driven with future climate data while atmospheric co2 was kept at present levels see section 2 3 jules has a prescribed vegetation seasonal cycle based on a monthly climatology of leaf area index see clark et al 2011 there are 4 soil layers with thicknesses starting at the surface of 0 1 0 25 0 65 and 2 0 m i e a soil profile of 3 m depth each gridbox is composed of nine tiles with six of those vegetated for each plant functional type a vegetation fractional coverage needs to be provided as well as values for the plant parameters see clark et al 2011 for each gridbox the soil texture information provided by the soil map marthews et al 2014 describes the soil data used in jules see also fig 2 has been used to calculate values for key soil parameters such as those relating to soil water flow the so called soil hydraulic parameters i e saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat and the field capacity referred to as critical point as jules uses a value of 33 kpa to set this point and wilting point two key soil moisture values on the water retention curve jules was configured by selecting the brooks and corey 1964 from here on referred to as bc soil hydraulic model with any excess water being pushed up if a soil layer becomes saturated as described in section 2 1 the upscale runs included jules to simulate the interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere however the gl3 configuration used during the upscale project invoked the van genuchten vg soil hydraulic scheme van genuchten 1980 which has been reported to cause jules to produce very low values for infiltration and potential recharge for certain soil types and conditions this is because there is a discrepancy in the shape of the water retention curves at the wet end between the bc and vg equations this discrepancy causes unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity at medium to high soil moisture contents to be underestimated when the vg parameters are approximated from the bc specific soil parameters as is currently standard practice among jules users and was also the case for gl3 while this concerns standard conversions between the shape parameters of both hydraulic approaches these are known to provide suboptimal parameter estimates near saturation hence for our off line study jules was run with the bc soil hydraulic scheme to obtain more realistic values for potential groundwater recharge we conducted some preliminary tests with the jules model where we compared hydrological flux outputs with either the vg or the bc hydraulic scheme invoked we found that with the bc scheme less runoff and more potential recharge was produced in fact with the vg scheme switched on hardly any drainage was produced the amounts of potential recharge simulated based on the jules bc runs were comparable to those found in the literature for the geographical areas under consideration this was the main reason for choosing bc over vg in our jules model runs the jules terrestrial water balance outputs comprised the sum of direct evaporation from the soil e s and transpiration from the plants t evaporation from the canopy interception e c throughfall thro p e c surface runoff r potential groundwater recharge drainage from soil base at 3 m d near surface soil moisture content 0 0 1 m ξ 0 0 1 m and total profile soil moisture content 0 3 m ξ 0 3 m the sum of e c e s and t will be referred to as evapotranspiration et jules includes a process based photosynthesis scheme enabling it to represent the bio physical response of vegetated surfaces to climate change a full description of the scheme including the mechanism by which it accounts for variation in co2 is given in clark et al 2011 the following section summarises the key processes the leaf level stomatal conductance g s is coupled to the rate of photosynthesis via the co2 diffusion equation 1 a g s c c c i 1 6 where c c and c i are the leaf surface and internal concentrations of co2 respectively jules represents photosynthesis as the minimum of three regimes i rubisco limited rate ii light limited rate and iii rate of transport of photosynthetic products each regime is affected by environmental conditions collatz et al 1991 leaf photosynthesis a is then derived by scaling maximum possible photosynthesis a p with a metric of available root zone soil moisture content β 2 a a p β the three limiting rates of photosynthesis and the co2 diffusion equation include a number of plant specific parameters in order to account for these variations jules categorises vegetation cover as a combination of five plant functional types pfts broad leaf trees needle leaf trees c3 grass c4 grass and shrubs 2 3 jules model sensitivity runs a number of model perturbations were conducted to explore the effects of co2 fertilisation and blanket land use change 2 3 1 effects of co2 fertilisation in addition to the runs described in section 2 2 jules was also run with the driving data from the 3 ensemble members with future climate but in this case with present climate co2 concentrations these runs helped explore the separate effects of changes in meteorology and co2 increase to assess the vegetation s response to co2 fertilisation on the west african water balance in particular the partitioning of soil moisture to plants via root water uptake and then transpiration and to potential groundwater recharge 2 3 2 effects of land use change to examine the controls on the water balance exerted by vegetation type jules was run with the entire land area covered with a single vegetation type as represented by different pfts either broadleaf trees or c4 grass the latter to represent crops such as maize and sorghum using just one of the present climate ensemble members with present co2 concentrations these runs were to provide a general picture of the effects of deforestation transition from trees to mixed vegetation and intensification of agriculture transition from the actual mixed vegetation to crops on the terrestrial water balance 2 4 presentation and statistical exploration of model outputs to examine the change in the meteorological conditions of west africa maps were plotted of the changes from present to future climate in the multi year mean summer jjas upscale temperature and atmospheric variables relating to large scale circulation the spatial changes in the monsoon are presented by plotting the absolute increases in the multi year mean rainfall and the amount of intense rain p high p 16 mm day was chosen as a representative value next the changes in the water balance predicted by jules were examined by plotting the absolute increases in the multi year mean water balance components in each case t tests were used to determine where the changes are 95 statistically significant for the differences between climate values for two sets of model runs whether directly from upscale or from the jules outputs driven by upscale 3 t run 1 run 2 σ run 1 2 n run 1 σ run 2 2 n run 2 here σ is the standard deviation and n the number of years that are available for a particular run or sets of runs when comparing the future and present climate model runs n run 1 and n run 2 are 81 3 27 years and 135 5 27 years respectively whereas when comparing the future climate runs with future or present co2 n run 1 n run 2 81 and when comparing the results from different vegetation coverage both equal 27 i e one present climate ensemble only is used to drive jules the differences between runs are 95 significant if t 2 or t 2 the change in seasonality of the water balance between the present and future climate is also examined by focussing on the region delineated by 5 w to 5 e and 4 21 n to provide a zonally averaged transect through the savanna and sahel climate zones this transect is used to present the multi year mean changes in temperature and large scale circulation and absolute increases in rainfall and water budgets by latitude and month to examine the progression of the monsoon and determine its spatial and temporal changes this central region is further divided into four sub regions that are largely composed of southern ghana 7 9 n northern ghana 9 11 n southern burkina faso 11 13 n and northern burkina faso 13 15 n although the results for these sub regions also contain data for other countries e g benin togo mali etc we refer to them via the names mentioned above the water balance components and their statistics were calculated within these sub regions and within two sub regions on either side west sahel ws 15 5 w 10 15 n and east sahel es 5 15 e 10 15 n fig 1 shows the locations of the sub regions finally to examine in more detail the range of summer jjas monthly p values and the dependence of et r and d on monthly p the northern ghana and southern burkina faso sub regions were selected as there is limited variation in rainfall patterns and vegetation and soil the modelled p and relevant water balance output values from each grid box in these regions for each summer month in all years were divided into 20 bins of equal numbers of grid box months according to rainfall amount hence the bins range from the 5 driest months to the 5 wettest months to accurately represent the rainfall distribution in each bin the means and standard deviations were calculated for the rainfall and other variables then et e c thro r and d all expressed as percentage of monthly rain were plotted against monthly p for present and future climates and future climate with present co2 concentrations see section 2 3 for more detail 3 results and discussion 3

mean summer jjas near surface meteorological conditions from present 1985 2011 to future 2085 2111 predict air temperature increases of 4 9 c with the greatest increases over the sahara fig 3a a zone of decreased atmospheric air pressures fig 3d we find increased air pressures in the coastal zones with predicted increases in the meridional gradients over the sahel here defined as 10 15 n the enhanced saharan heat low perturbs large scale summer circulation under future climate with increased monsoon winds the model runs also indicate zonal winds are increased particularly over the sahara while the meridional winds are increased across much of west africa particularly over the eastern sahel but reduced over the western sahel fig 3e f these findings fit with those of cook and vizy 2015 who used three reanalyses of 1 5 resolution era interim ncep 2 and merra and two observational datasets of 0 5 cru and ghcn for 1979 2012 to show that the sahara temperature has increased 2 4 times faster than the tropical mean strengthening the summertime heat low and african easterly jet while weakening the wintertime anticyclone and low level harmattan winds near surface specific atmospheric humidity fig 3b is also projected to increase consistent with higher temperatures and stronger monsoon winds carrying more moisture originating from the gulf of guinea for future climates net shortwave radiation fig 3g is reduced over most of the sahel indicating that cloud coverage has increased surface albedo was kept constant between present and future however net shortwave radiation has increased in parts of the west between 10 and 12 n and in the coastal region around the gulf of guinea which has increased winds from the north bringing in drier air masses with fewer clouds this is also apparent from the reductions in rainfall for future climate conditions see fig 4a net longwave radiation fig 3h is increased over most of the area except for a small area in the west coinciding with the area of increased net shortwave radiation future longwave radiation will be increased as a result of the higher air temperatures causing increased values of downwelling radiation from the atmosphere and clouds based on stefan boltzmann s law l ε a σ t a 4 with ε a the atmospheric emissivity and σ the stefan boltzmann constant note however that the increase in downwelling longwave radiation will be countered in part by increased upwelling longwave radiation from the land surface caused by reductions in total actual et see fig 4c atmospheric emissivity and hence net longwave radiation also depends on cloud cover type of clouds air temperature and humidity so the changes in these variables will have moderated the extent of the increase in net longwave radiation although we are not presenting a figure of cloud cover fig 4a showing the changes in precipitation between present and future climate implies that changes in cloud cover will be variable across the region total net radiation i e net shortwave plus net longwave radiation is generally increased fig 3i as the increase in net longwave radiation is greater than the decrease in net shortwave radiation values for pet see section 2 1 for details on its calculation are also predicted to increase under future climates only positive changes are shown in fig 3c largely as a result of increased temperatures fig 3a and net radiation fig 3i increased pet means atmospheric water demand will be greater in the future but present to future changes in actual et see fig 4c and table 1 will be modulated by changes in the availability of soil water and by changes in atmospheric co2 concentration via the co2 fertilisation effect both affect t via root water uptake and plant physiological feedbacks that dictate the degree of stomatal opening future annual p fig 4a is increased in the central southwest and northeast regions of west africa 12 2 in east sahel 6 9 in northern ghana and 8 9 in southern burkina faso sub regions table 1 but reduced in the south and west 13 5 in west sahel a pattern consistent with the change in summer large scale circulation due to the enhanced heat low see fig 3d f kamga et al 2005 found that increased atmospheric moisture and stronger meridional winds would lead to a wetter sahel in the late 21st century our findings show a wetter eastern sahel but a drier western sahel the change in the spatial pattern of rainfall presented in fig 4a is similar to the multi model cmip5 mean described by roehrig et al 2013 and diallo et al 2016 and also to the predictions of gaetani et al 2020 the increases in p high fig 4b are greater than those for total p over large areas and heavy rain is even increased for many areas in the south where the total is reduced showing that rainfall becomes more intense under future climatic conditions table 2 shows that in the future p high is a greater fraction of the total p in all six sub regions with increases ranging between 4 and 11 row 1 in table 2 compared to the present climate sylla et al 2015 and fitzpatrick et al 2020 also predict more intense rainfall events due to stronger moisture convergence in the future total et which includes interception evaporation as well as the sum of e s and t what jules calls the evaporation from the soil compartment is predicted to decrease across large areas in the west and south of west africa fig 4c despite the increased p and pet values fig 3c under future climate conditions et is projected to decrease considerably for west sahel by nearly 20 and somewhat for northern and southern ghana whereas it increases between 2 and 6 for the other regions within all six sub regions et p is reduced by 1 7 see table 2 e s t see fig 4d is reduced over large areas whereas e c fig 4e is generally slightly increased due to the greater rainfall and increased pet but not in the eastern sahel where rainfall is reduced the decreased evaporation from the soil compartment is most likely mainly due to reduced t as this is generally the largest component in et the near surface soil moisture contents ξ 0 0 1 m fig 4f are reduced over most of west africa and in most sub regions table 1 row 3 in particular for the west sahel where rainfall is decreased also in the future e s t which is predominantly composed of t is reduced despite the higher ξ 0 3 m values fig 4i and table 1 indicating that reduced t is not caused by increased plant water stress as this would occur if soil moisture contents were reduced rather reduced transpiration in the future is caused by the concurrent climatic feedbacks relating to physical variables as well as increased co2 concentration affecting photosynthesis and lowering stomatal conductance see e g kirschbaum and mcmillan 2018 surface runoff r and potential groundwater recharge d fig 4g h overall show modest to relatively large increases note that these changes are not statistically significant over the northern parts of the west african domain the projected changes in r vary between a decrease of 10 west sahel to an increase of 40 s burkina faso mainly because of the larger amount of rain falling during heavy events see table 2 this causes increased r particularly where surfaces are bare or sparsely vegetated interestingly d is predicted to increase in all regions apart from northern burkina faso where the model simulates d 0 for present climate and for some regions quite dramatically e g northern ghana 145 south burkina faso 333 and east sahel 110 this is largely related to an increase in ξ 0 3 m fig 4i that goes up by between 2 5 and 14 for future climate conditions table 1 as a result of increased p et values demonstrating a shift in the water stored in the soil between present and future climate mainly as a result of reduced root water uptake increased values of ξ 0 3 m cause soil hydraulic conductivity to increase which in turn increases potential groundwater recharge however values of r p barely change in most sub regions by about 2 5 maximally for potential recharge in southern ghana row 3 table 2 in contrast future d p increases considerably under future climate conditions bold numbers in table 2 whereas under the present climate conditions d takes up anywhere between 0 and 16 of total rainfall in the future this is 1 20 with a doubling from 5 to 10 in northern ghana and east sahel part of the shift in water balance is caused by a greater proportion of the increased rainfall passing through the canopy as throughfall thro see also fig 6a b rather than evaporating from there ec and reaching the soil surface where it then either runs off or infiltrates into the soil the values of ec p are slightly reduced over burkina faso and east sahel in table 2 note that et is also inhibited during rain due to reduced solar radiation and increased humidity which allows more of the water to infiltrate the soil future rainfall amounts show moderate changes of between 13 5 west sahel and 12 2 east sahel in table 1 3 1 2 present to future changes effects of plant physiological response and vegetation cover for improved understanding of the future changes in water balance the separate effects of the physical meteorological driving variables and the plant physiological response to increased co2 were examined by using the jules runs with future climate but with co2 concentrations kept at present levels see section 2 3 the results are presented in fig 5 and tables 1 and 2 also the influence of vegetation cover on the terrestrial water balance was considered see tables 3 and 4 with just the changes in meteorology the climate effect fig 5 left plots total et changes fig 5d are largely resulting from the changes in p as illustrated by a very similar spatial patterns of rainfall increase fig 4a changes in ξ 0 3 m fig 5g also roughly reflect the rainfall pattern while r and d fig 5a j show increases well inland between 9 and 13 n where the greatest increases in heavy rainfall 16 mm day occur fig 4b whereas regions to the west and south have reduced potential recharge in south burkina faso and east sahel et does not increase as much as rainfall leading to increased ξ 0 3 m between 1 and 4 table 1 and to slightly increased r p values compared to present climate 0 4 and d 0 7 table 2 the increases in ξ 0 3 m and d despite the increased pet see fig 3c are driven by increased rainfall with just the increase in co2 for future climatic conditions the co2 effect fig 5 middle e s t and hence total et fig 5e is reduced across west africa which confirms that reduced total et is largely due to the vegetation co2 response ξ 0 3 m r and d fig 5h b k are increased across west africa because less water is removed from the soil by plant roots as stomatal opening and therefore transpiration is reduced these observations hold in all sub regions tables 1 and 2 with d p further increased by between 3 and 5 of the total rainfall comparing mixed vegetation to uniform c4 grass representing crops such as sorghum and maize the land cover effect water balance differences are subtle with slight increases in total et across most of west africa fig 5f and mostly small reductions in ξ 0 3 m r and d fig 5i c l the exception is the sahara where soil moisture reductions are large under the previously bare ground and the soil moisture changes are generally more significant evaporation is increased by 1 2 in the sub regions reducing ξ 0 3 m content by 2 5 though ξ 0 0 1 m is increased apart from northern ghana by between 5 and 29 table 3 r is reduced by 1 when expressed as fraction of the rainfall and potential recharge by 1 table 4 when the land cover is changed from mixed vegetation to c4 grass the changes and the absolute values of the flux partitioning in table 4 correspond well with those shown in table 2 for present conditions even though only one present climate ensemble member was used to produce the results in table 4 this indicates the robustness of the individual upscale ensemble members these changes show greater water uptake by the c4 grass representing crops going from mixed vegetation to uniform broadleaf trees results in little change in total et in the central sub regions despite the increase in e c and ξ 0 3 m by 2 4 slightly increased r and only slight changes in d 3 1 3 spatiotemporal dependencies of the water balance fluxes on rainfall amount and frequency the dependence of the water balance flux partitioning on rainfall amount and frequency is examined more closely by taking values for each individual summer month for each grid square in the sub regions of northern ghana and southern burkina faso and arranging these by amount of rainfall fig 6a b shows that thro increases from 80 of p in the driest summer months to 96 in the wettest months this indicates that proportionally less water evaporates from the canopy during the wettest months as is also apparent from the decrease in e c lowest line in these plots the fractions allocated to thro only depend on the amount of rain with the same relationship for present and future climate so allocation to thro is predicted to increase slightly in the future as rainfall increases with an increase in monthly rainfall the fraction of et goes from an average of 100 of the monthly rainfall or more for individual gridcells with the additional water coming from the water already stored in the soil to only 20 30 partly due to the suppression of et during rainfall and during conditions of high relative humidity contributions of monthly rainfall to r and d are near zero in the driest months but can be greater than 25 and 45 of the rainfall respectively in the wettest months fig 6c f from present blue lines in fig 6 to future meteorological conditions red lines for present co2 and black lines for future co2 both the mean values and the standard deviations of the highest monthly rainfall values increase rainfall ranges also shown at the top of fig 6c d this is important since vellinga et al 2016 found that most inter annual variability is from changes in organised heavy rainfall events if co2 concentration remains unchanged red lines the higher temperatures and resulting pet lead to greater et although because of the increase in the highest monthly rainfalls et represents a smaller portion of the rain when going from present to future meteorology at present co2 concentrations red lines the fraction allocated to r fig 6c d is slightly increased in low rainfall months but reduced in high rainfall months while the contribution to d fig 6e f is slightly reduced in low rainfall months but increased in high rainfall months although the changes are small compared to the increase in et fraction at future co2 combined with future meteorological conditions black lines the fraction of monthly rainfall allocated to d is generally increased and the ratio r p slightly increased as t and hence overall et is reduced due to the plant response to increased co2 causing stomata to close it is expected that high rainfall leads to increased d because of higher ξ 0 3 m fig 4i fig 6e f shows that this effect is amplified by greater allocation of p to d during high rainfall months under future climate and increased co2 conditions this is even more evident with high rainfall months associated with significantly greater allocation to d than in present climate when co2 is held at present levels however the allocation to d under future meteorological conditions is similar to that under present conditions unless p 350 mm month 1 this suggests that the main driver of increased allocation of p to d is decreased t and hence reduced extraction of moisture from the soil column any effect of intensification of rainfall between present and future climate on e c is not evident fig 6a b only the total amount of rain the importance of reduced t for increased d is not highlighted by many studies on the impact of climate change on groundwater resources with intensification of rainfall considered the primary driver taylor et al 2013 however it should be noted that the jules model does not incorporate the process of focussed recharge in areas where surface runoff concentrates a process which is likely to become more important for groundwater recharge with rainfall intensification jasechko and taylor 2015 cuthbert et al 2019 comparing the sub regions of northern ghana fig 6 left column and southern burkina faso fig 6 right column the dependencies on monthly rainfall climate and co2 concentration are similar but overall the allocation to et is greater and the allocations to r and d less in the hotter climate of burkina faso table 2 shows the overall mean allocations in these sub regions similarly the effects of land cover on the dependency of the monthly water balance components on monthly rainfall are examined in fig 7 by using the jules runs with uniform vegetation one of the present climate upscale ensemble members with present co2 uniform broadleaf tree cover leads to slightly increased proportions of monthly rainfall allocated to e c due to the taller canopy which increases turbulence and higher leaf area index reduced et especially in southern burkina faso and slightly greater r and d values than for the mixed vegetation coverage northern ghana a simulated land use change to uniform c4 grass cover also gives slightly increased e c though not as much as for the trees but increased et and slightly lower d compared to the mixed coverage though again these are only minor effects at high monthly rainfall amounts the et p ratios converge tables 3 and 4 show the overall mean changes in these sub regions 3 1 4 present to future changes seasonal variations and shifts analysis of seasonality focusses on the region delineated by 5 w to 5 e and 4 21 n air temperatures are increased throughout the year from present to future climate with enhanced meridional gradients in temperature and surface pressure from late spring to early autumn fig 8a and d many of the variables in fig 8 show a northwards progression during spring to give the greatest increases over the north in the summer followed by a southward retreat in the autumn for humidity pet and wind there are reduced values of net shortwave radiation implying greater cloud cover for most of the year and latitudes but increases during the summer months for the southern half implying less cloud net longwave radiation has increased over the entire domain in particular during autumn and winter whereas total net radiation is increased particularly in late spring total rainfall is slightly increased in late spring reduced in early summer then increased in late summer and autumn fig 9a in the south rainfall is reduced over most of the year then increased in autumn while heavy rain fig 9b is reduced in june and july between 5 and 7 n but increased particularly in august and september between 9 and 12 n the pattern of temporal and spatial changes shows that the monsoon occurs later in summer and moves northwards in the future climate ibrahim et al 2014 used simulated rainfall data produced by five regional climate models under the a1b scenario over two periods 1971 2000 as reference period and 2021 2050 as projection period and found that the rainy season onset is projected by all models to be delayed by one week on average sylla et al 2015 also predict a delay in the monsoon onset values of e s t see fig 9d mainly the result of decreased transpiration is generally reduced in the future climate except in the north in late spring and late summer while changes in e c fig 9e follow the changes in total rainfall as expected r fig 9g is reduced in the south 4 9 n from march to october but increased between 9 and 12 n in august and september d fig 9h is reduced between 4 and 8 n from june to november but increased between 9 and 13 n from august to october ξ 0 0 1 m fig 9f is generally reduced throughout the year while ξ 0 3 m fig 9i is generally greater particularly between 9 and 13 n from october to june but less in the south 4 7 n from june to november 4 conclusions analysis of outputs from the global high resolution climate model upscale has shown significant changes for the future monsoon in the west africa region with higher temperatures over land particularly in the sahara increased atmospheric humidity and increased cloud cover leading to greater net radiation this results in an enhanced saharan heat low in summer with greater south north temperature and pressure gradients in west africa and an altered large scale circulation pattern greater overall rainfall is predicted within the region due to higher atmospheric humidity and stronger monsoon winds with the summer wind direction coming more from the north over the western sahel leading to reduced rainfall but more from the south over the eastern sahel leading to increased rainfall the monsoon is predicted to move further to the north and both its onset and end will occur later in the summer for future climates the higher air temperatures and increased humidity under future climatic conditions lead to more intense rain for large parts of west africa in particular the central and north eastern parts jules runs driven with the upscale atmospheric output show that for the north eastern parts of west africa increased future rainfall results in increased evapotranspiration surface runoff soil moisture content and potential recharge however with regards to the partitioning of the rainfall received the fraction of total evapotranspiration et including interception evaporation ec is reduced as rainfall increases partly due to the suppression of all evaporation and an increasing fraction going to throughfall this results in greater fractions of the rainfall going to surface runoff and infiltrating into the soil layers resulting in increased potential recharge sensitivity experiments in which atmospheric co2 is kept at present levels while the other atmospheric conditions are representative of future climates suggest that the primary driver of projected increased potential recharge is reduced transpiration with the increase in rainfall a secondary factor changing vegetation type does appear to have a strong effect on potential recharge while the results appear robust we acknowledge that differences in model structure and hydraulic parameter selection can affect water balance flux partitioning see also sorensen et al 2014 and weihermüller et al 2021 however we are currently conducting local level runs with models such as the swap model van dam et al 2008 to study the water balance in this region in more detail and our findings broadly confirm the results of this paper furthermore the large scale jules setup assumes uniform diffuse movement of water through the subsurface and does not allow the accumulation of water within topographic depressions which facilitates focussed groundwater recharge focussed recharge is also likely to increase in line with predicted surface runoff although predominantly due to increases in projected rainfall taylor et al 2013 cuthbert et al 2019 potential increases in groundwater recharge are important as the greater development of groundwater resources is considered as a

7974,study region west africa with a focus between 5 w and 5 e study focus the effects of changing climate and co2 concentration rcp8 5 between 2000 and 2100 on the west african monsoon are examined using the upscale high resolution 25 km global climate model ensembles for present and future climate combined with the jules land surface model new hydrological insights future climate is predicted to have an enhanced summertime saharan heat low changing large scale circulation causing monsoon rainfall generally to increase the monsoon progresses further inland and occurs later in the year upscale rainfall projections indicate that the eastern sahel becomes wetter 12 2 but the western sahel drier 13 5 future evapotranspiration is reduced across most of west africa due to the co2 fertilisation effect causing lower transpiration potential groundwater recharge soil drainage at the bottom of a 3 m deep soil column is predicted to increase from 0 to 16 of rainfall under present climate to 1 20 in the future doubling from 5 to 10 in northern ghana and the eastern sahel potential recharge increases largely due to increased soil hydraulic conductivity caused by higher soil moisture resulting from increased rainfall and reduced transpiration other factors have only a minor influence on the water balance and potential recharge including rainfall intensity and land use type a predicted increase in future potential groundwater recharge is significant as development of groundwater resources is seen as a key means to meet growing water demand in west africa keywords west african monsoon soil water balance co2 fertilisation land use change water resources 1 introduction the west african summer monsoon is caused by the saharan heat low setting up a southwest to northeast air flow from the coast to the sahel which brings moist air from the atlantic to provide rainfall from june to september each year meynadier et al 2010a 2010b marsham et al 2013 the coastal region sees a bimodal monsoon the monsoon is vital for the population of the region with the rainfall providing the seasonal influx to terrestrial water resources to support drinking water sources agricultural production and economic development coulibaly et al 2018 naabil et al 2017 ascott et al 2020 there is a substantial body of research demonstrating that characteristics of the monsoon have already changed over recent decades most of the west african rain is from mesoscale convective systems and taylor et al 2017 used satellite observations to show an increased frequency of extreme storms in the sahel between 1982 and 2016 due to an increased south north temperature gradient previously panthou et al 2014 used rain gauge data from a network of 43 stations to show sahelian rainfall has an increasing fraction of extreme rainfall defined as occurring 2 5 times per year on average at any station more recently panthou et al 2018 used a large set of daily rain gauge data 1950 onwards with 5 min rain observations from the amma catch niger observatory since 1990 to find increased mean intensity of rainy days and higher frequency of heavy rainfall in the sahel a new era of extremes since 2000 and a stronger increase in extreme rain in east sahel than in the west moreover dardel et al 2014 used the gimms 3g ndvi dataset between 1981 and 2011 and found statistically significant increases in rainfall over almost all the sahel with long term field observations showing re greening in places odoulami and akinsanola 2018 examined west african monsoon daily rainfall trends measured by gpcp and trmm during 1998 2013 finding reduced rainfall in the region of guinea and increased rainfall in the sahel bichet and diedhiou 2018 using the chirps dataset at 0 05 resolution over 1981 2014 found that the west african sahel has become wetter principally from the number of wet days 10 days compared to the normal over the entire sahel band along with an increase in intensity over the central part 3 mm day they also found that although dry spells are also becoming more frequent these are on average shorter by 30 over the entire sahel band so do not represent a reduction in rainfall and that precipitation intensity in the west senegal has decreased by around 3 mm day sacre regis et al 2020 used chirps data over 1986 2015 finding increased precipitation and more wet days in the west and central sahel various researchers have also explored how the west african monsoon is likely to change under future climate projections using both regional and global climate models global modelling studies have generally found that rainfall over west africa increases in the east with some models projecting decreases over the west maynard et al 2002 for example used the meteo france climate model arpege climate at a resolution of 312 km to predict the impact of increasing greenhouse gases and aerosols on precipitable water water vapour recycling moisture convergence and precipitation efficiency they reported an enhanced monsoon precipitation at the end of the twenty first century and changes in the position and strength of the african easterly jet and the hadley and walker circulations kamga et al 2005 compared the national center for atmospheric research ncar coupled atmosphere ocean climate system model csm simulation at 312 km resolution to long term observations and to the national centers for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis finding increases in west africa summer jja temperatures of 1 5 2 5 c between 1951 and 1980 and the late 21st century also they predicted that the sahel would likely be wetter in the late 21st century with increased atmospheric moisture stronger meridional winds from the gulf of guinea and a slightly stronger aej roehrig et al 2013 used results from the 5th climate model intercomparison project cmip5 resolutions between 0 25 and 2 8 to examine future rainfall in the sahel they found that the sahara has greater warming than land to the south and a good model consensus on reduced future precipitation in the western sahel 15 5w and increased precipitation in the east 0 30 e the gross projected patterns in west african precipitation change are similar for regional climate models rcms as for global climate models sylla et al 2015 used results from ensembles of earth system models esms and regional climate models rcms at 25 km resolution run for historical and future periods rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 to study high intensity daily precipitation events for west africa their findings showed a good match between model rainfall estimates and rainfall statistics derived from trmm and gpcp for present conditions and predicted a delay in monsoon onset in the future combined with more intense rainfall events due to stronger moisture convergence particularly in rcp8 5 and more so over the sahel than further south diallo et al 2016 modelled the future monsoon with the regional climate model regcm4 at 50 km resolution for 1970 2100 with driving data generated by hadgem2 es and mpi esm gcm global climate models under the rcp8 5 greenhouse gas concentration pathway they found changes to the african and tropical easterly jets a changing water budget with more extreme rainfall and again a drier west but a wetter east sahel todzo et al 2019 used outputs from cordex africa an ensemble of 18 high resolution 50 km regional climate projections rcp8 5 over 2006 2099 to find an intensification of the hydrological cycle in west africa they found that temperatures are expected to rise faster here than the global average rate leading to more intense but less frequent rainfall with longer dry spells at the finest spatial resolution kendon et al 2019 carried out climate change experiments with the cp4 a convection permitting high resolution 4 5 km model for the first time over the africa wide domain and projected greater future increases in extreme 3 hourly precipitation compared to a convection parameterised 25 km model but also future increases in dry spell length during the wet season over western and central africa berthou et al 2019 used results from cp4 a for the period 1997 2006 to improve simulations of the monsoon resulting in increased moisture convergence in the sahel more short lasting intense rainfall events mesoscale convective systems mcss better representation of wet and dry spells daily and sub daily and an improved diurnal cycle of rainfall which impacts the diurnal monsoon winds fitzpatrick et al 2020 used results from cp4 a rcp8 5 until 2100 and predicted a 28 increase of extreme rain rate mcss in the sahel mostly due to greater total water columns using clausius clapeyron scaling but with regional heterogeneity modulated by increased vertical wind shear when planning adaptation measures it is crucial to assess precipitation change in the context of present day variability a methodology for this is presented in gaetani et al 2020 which used 29 state of the art climate models 0 5 resolution 50 km to estimate the time of emergence toe of precipitation changes in west africa they found a clear difference between west and east sahel and a reduced occurrence of wet days likely to emerge before 2036 and a possible drier climate during 2028 2052 in the west but a wetter climate in the east with an increased occurrence of very wet days likely to emerge before 2054 increased rainfall does not necessarily lead to reduced irrigation demand sylla et al 2018 applied a 23 member ensemble of rcps 50 km resolution to assess hydrological changes for west africa under 2 c and 1 5 c global warming they found increased irrigation demand but reduced water availability in 10 major river basins in the area limiting sustainable agriculture in the 2 c scenario however impacts reduced by up to 50 in the 1 5 c scenario any changes in future climate encompassing variables such rainfall temperature and vapour pressure deficit will impact vegetation functioning moreover the concurrent changes in atmospheric co2 concentration will also play an important role in plant physiological behaviour the effects of elevated co2 concentrations on plant transpiration and water use efficiency have been known for many decades and have mainly been studied empirically using a number of laboratory in situ and remote sensing techniques as summarised in kirschbaum and mcmillan 2018 the general consensus is that photosynthesis will increase under elevated co2 concentrations while the concurrent reduction in stomatal opening in most plants will cause a reduction in transpiration xu et al 2016 the strength of this reduction will depend on climatic factors and soil water availability the projected changes in transpiration will affect rain forming processes for example mengis et al 2015 performed experiments with an intermediate complexity earth system climate model uvic escm 3 6 resolution for a range of model imposed transpiration sensitivities to co2 and found that by 2100 under a high emission scenario changing the sensitivity of transpiration to co2 caused a range of changes to the simulated terrestrial precipitation of 10 to 27 their study emphasises the importance of an improved assessment of the dynamics of environmental impact on vegetation to better predict future changes of the terrestrial hydrological and carbon cycles any future changes in rainfall amount and timing during the monsoon have implications in terms of the west african terrestrial water balance and hence for water and food security much of the region is underlain by low storage and low productive aquifers which are more susceptible to short term decreases in groundwater recharge resulting from lower rainfall than elsewhere in the continent adelana and macdonald 2008 bianchi et al 2020 changes in rainfall intensity cuthbert et al 2019 and land use change favreau et al 2009 may also affect groundwater recharge the frequently dispersed communities also often rely on small reservoirs uneca 2015 which have limited capacity and depend on more regular rainfall driven inflows in semi arid regions krol et al 2011 in terms of food production agriculture is predominantly rainfed sultan and gaetani 2016 and is highly dependent on seasonal rainfall cooper and coe 2011 this type of agriculture is the mainstay of rural livelihoods in this region and the primary source of food for the urban centres the study presented here represents a novel analysis of hydrological variability in west africa 17 w to 15 e 4 21 n using an ensemble of high resolution 25 km climate simulations upscale see section 2 1 this resolution is higher than that used in most other studies mentioned above apart from that used in the convection permitting studies previous work has shown that low resolution global coupled models represent the variability in precipitation poorly in this region because of biases in sea surface temperatures sst dunning et al 2017 and crude topography jung and kunstmann 2007 upscale in contrast captures the variability well dunning et al 2017 black et al 2021 this paper furthermore extends previous work on precipitation change e g roehrig et al 2013 by considering the full water balance at the land surface by using the upscale near surface atmospheric variables to drive the jules land surface model also the physiological impacts of climate change via increases in co2 concentration on vegetation functioning are explicitly considered along with the implications for the terrestrial water balance this effect has been little explored for west africa within the west african geographical domain we focus on a central region which includes burkina faso and ghana 5 w to 5 e where rainfall patterns and vegetation and soil are fairly constant laterally across a series of zones these zones provide a north south transect through the savanna and sahel climate zones fig 1 first we discuss the key atmospheric variables relating to the large scale circulation during the west african summer monsoon obtained from upscale for current and future climates next the resulting present and future rainfall their daily intensity and the spatial and temporal patterns of the monsoon are presented and discussed as well as the effects on the terrestrial water balance with emphasis on the partitioning of precipitation water between evapotranspiration surface runoff potential recharge soil drainage flux at the bottom of a 3 m deep soil column we use potential here because in reality some of this drainage flux may become interflow and hence will not recharge the aquifers and soil moisture storage finally the influence of vegetation cover on the present to future changes in the water balance as well as the physiological response of the vegetation to increasing co2 concentrations are analysed and discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 upscale current and future climate data in this study data were taken from the upscale uk on prace weather resolving simulations of climate for global environmental risk mizielinski et al 2014 project high resolution 25 km ensemble of climate simulations these simulations are based upon the hadgem3 global atmosphere 3 ga3 and global land 3 gl3 configurations of the uk meteorological office unified model um and the joint uk land environment simulator jules respectively as documented in walters et al 2011 the upscale simulations were forced with ostia ssts and current atmospheric co2 concentration 5 241 10 4 kg kg for present climate 5 ensemble members covering 27 years between 1985 and 2011 and with ostia ssts plus the anticipated sst change from 1990 2010 to 2090 2110 in the hadgem2 earth system run under the ipcc representative concentration pathway 8 5 climate change scenario and increased co2 concentration 1 4217 10 3 kg kg for future climate 3 ensemble members also for 27 years each co2 concentration was kept constant during each 27 year run the ensembles provide large datasets of simulated current and future climate for statistical studies the land surface is prescribed a global emissivity of 0 97 while the albedo is set by the jules land surface model the global high resolution and large number of ensemble members of upscale are expected to capture the details of the spatiotemporal distribution of atmospheric variables and large scale circulation in our case to allow for reliable simulation of the changes in the west african monsoon and terrestrial water balance under a changing climate the upscale outputs comprise a range of atmospheric outputs at different model levels in our results section we present the near surface data values for the potential evapotranspiration pet were not available from upscale and were calculated using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 for our study 2 2 off line distributed jules runs driven with upscale climate data the daily atmospheric variables from upscale were used to drive the jules land surface model best et al 2011 clark et al 2011 walters et al 2011 version 4 1 that was provided with data on vegetation cover and soil texture see fig 2 to produce model estimates of the terrestrial water balance and energy balance in west africa the driving variables are rainfall p mean air temperature diurnal air temperature range downwelling short and longwave radiation specific humidity surface pressure and wind speed jules was run across west africa in distributed fashion with 91 72 individual grid boxes between 17 w and 15 e longitude 17 w to 15 e and 4 and 21 n latitude 4 21 n the land surface model runs also allow us to study the response of plants to the changing climate and co2 concentration which will affect the water balance as well as model sensitivities with regards to vegetation type and coverage as explained below for jules the upscale daily data were disaggregated into hourly time steps for each day the total rainfall is restricted to one event of duration τ 6 h for convective rain which is placed at random in the day provided there is a dry period of at least τ hrs before the end of the day for especially extreme rainfall greater than 350 mm day τ is increased air temperature is given a diurnal cycle set by the daily mean and diurnal temperature range with the maximum temperature occurring at 0 15 of a day 3 h and 36 min after local noon the downwelling radiation values are also given diurnal cycles with longwave depending on the air temperature following stefan boltzmann s law assuming black body radiation while shortwave depends on the angle of the sun above the horizon daily specific humidity is kept constant throughout the day except if the relative humidity reaches 100 with saturated vapour pressure calculated from the hourly air temperature in which case the humidity is limited to this value during these hours and hence is not conserved both pressure and wind are kept constant throughout the day in concordance with the upscale runs atmospheric co2 was also set to 5 241 10 4 kg kg for present climate and 1 4217 10 3 kg kg for future climate although we also conducted jules runs driven with future climate data while atmospheric co2 was kept at present levels see section 2 3 jules has a prescribed vegetation seasonal cycle based on a monthly climatology of leaf area index see clark et al 2011 there are 4 soil layers with thicknesses starting at the surface of 0 1 0 25 0 65 and 2 0 m i e a soil profile of 3 m depth each gridbox is composed of nine tiles with six of those vegetated for each plant functional type a vegetation fractional coverage needs to be provided as well as values for the plant parameters see clark et al 2011 for each gridbox the soil texture information provided by the soil map marthews et al 2014 describes the soil data used in jules see also fig 2 has been used to calculate values for key soil parameters such as those relating to soil water flow the so called soil hydraulic parameters i e saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat and the field capacity referred to as critical point as jules uses a value of 33 kpa to set this point and wilting point two key soil moisture values on the water retention curve jules was configured by selecting the brooks and corey 1964 from here on referred to as bc soil hydraulic model with any excess water being pushed up if a soil layer becomes saturated as described in section 2 1 the upscale runs included jules to simulate the interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere however the gl3 configuration used during the upscale project invoked the van genuchten vg soil hydraulic scheme van genuchten 1980 which has been reported to cause jules to produce very low values for infiltration and potential recharge for certain soil types and conditions this is because there is a discrepancy in the shape of the water retention curves at the wet end between the bc and vg equations this discrepancy causes unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity at medium to high soil moisture contents to be underestimated when the vg parameters are approximated from the bc specific soil parameters as is currently standard practice among jules users and was also the case for gl3 while this concerns standard conversions between the shape parameters of both hydraulic approaches these are known to provide suboptimal parameter estimates near saturation hence for our off line study jules was run with the bc soil hydraulic scheme to obtain more realistic values for potential groundwater recharge we conducted some preliminary tests with the jules model where we compared hydrological flux outputs with either the vg or the bc hydraulic scheme invoked we found that with the bc scheme less runoff and more potential recharge was produced in fact with the vg scheme switched on hardly any drainage was produced the amounts of potential recharge simulated based on the jules bc runs were comparable to those found in the literature for the geographical areas under consideration this was the main reason for choosing bc over vg in our jules model runs the jules terrestrial water balance outputs comprised the sum of direct evaporation from the soil e s and transpiration from the plants t evaporation from the canopy interception e c throughfall thro p e c surface runoff r potential groundwater recharge drainage from soil base at 3 m d near surface soil moisture content 0 0 1 m ξ 0 0 1 m and total profile soil moisture content 0 3 m ξ 0 3 m the sum of e c e s and t will be referred to as evapotranspiration et jules includes a process based photosynthesis scheme enabling it to represent the bio physical response of vegetated surfaces to climate change a full description of the scheme including the mechanism by which it accounts for variation in co2 is given in clark et al 2011 the following section summarises the key processes the leaf level stomatal conductance g s is coupled to the rate of photosynthesis via the co2 diffusion equation 1 a g s c c c i 1 6 where c c and c i are the leaf surface and internal concentrations of co2 respectively jules represents photosynthesis as the minimum of three regimes i rubisco limited rate ii light limited rate and iii rate of transport of photosynthetic products each regime is affected by environmental conditions collatz et al 1991 leaf photosynthesis a is then derived by scaling maximum possible photosynthesis a p with a metric of available root zone soil moisture content β 2 a a p β the three limiting rates of photosynthesis and the co2 diffusion equation include a number of plant specific parameters in order to account for these variations jules categorises vegetation cover as a combination of five plant functional types pfts broad leaf trees needle leaf trees c3 grass c4 grass and shrubs 2 3 jules model sensitivity runs a number of model perturbations were conducted to explore the effects of co2 fertilisation and blanket land use change 2 3 1 effects of co2 fertilisation in addition to the runs described in section 2 2 jules was also run with the driving data from the 3 ensemble members with future climate but in this case with present climate co2 concentrations these runs helped explore the separate effects of changes in meteorology and co2 increase to assess the vegetation s response to co2 fertilisation on the west african water balance in particular the partitioning of soil moisture to plants via root water uptake and then transpiration and to potential groundwater recharge 2 3 2 effects of land use change to examine the controls on the water balance exerted by vegetation type jules was run with the entire land area covered with a single vegetation type as represented by different pfts either broadleaf trees or c4 grass the latter to represent crops such as maize and sorghum using just one of the present climate ensemble members with present co2 concentrations these runs were to provide a general picture of the effects of deforestation transition from trees to mixed vegetation and intensification of agriculture transition from the actual mixed vegetation to crops on the terrestrial water balance 2 4 presentation and statistical exploration of model outputs to examine the change in the meteorological conditions of west africa maps were plotted of the changes from present to future climate in the multi year mean summer jjas upscale temperature and atmospheric variables relating to large scale circulation the spatial changes in the monsoon are presented by plotting the absolute increases in the multi year mean rainfall and the amount of intense rain p high p 16 mm day was chosen as a representative value next the changes in the water balance predicted by jules were examined by plotting the absolute increases in the multi year mean water balance components in each case t tests were used to determine where the changes are 95 statistically significant for the differences between climate values for two sets of model runs whether directly from upscale or from the jules outputs driven by upscale 3 t run 1 run 2 σ run 1 2 n run 1 σ run 2 2 n run 2 here σ is the standard deviation and n the number of years that are available for a particular run or sets of runs when comparing the future and present climate model runs n run 1 and n run 2 are 81 3 27 years and 135 5 27 years respectively whereas when comparing the future climate runs with future or present co2 n run 1 n run 2 81 and when comparing the results from different vegetation coverage both equal 27 i e one present climate ensemble only is used to drive jules the differences between runs are 95 significant if t 2 or t 2 the change in seasonality of the water balance between the present and future climate is also examined by focussing on the region delineated by 5 w to 5 e and 4 21 n to provide a zonally averaged transect through the savanna and sahel climate zones this transect is used to present the multi year mean changes in temperature and large scale circulation and absolute increases in rainfall and water budgets by latitude and month to examine the progression of the monsoon and determine its spatial and temporal changes this central region is further divided into four sub regions that are largely composed of southern ghana 7 9 n northern ghana 9 11 n southern burkina faso 11 13 n and northern burkina faso 13 15 n although the results for these sub regions also contain data for other countries e g benin togo mali etc we refer to them via the names mentioned above the water balance components and their statistics were calculated within these sub regions and within two sub regions on either side west sahel ws 15 5 w 10 15 n and east sahel es 5 15 e 10 15 n fig 1 shows the locations of the sub regions finally to examine in more detail the range of summer jjas monthly p values and the dependence of et r and d on monthly p the northern ghana and southern burkina faso sub regions were selected as there is limited variation in rainfall patterns and vegetation and soil the modelled p and relevant water balance output values from each grid box in these regions for each summer month in all years were divided into 20 bins of equal numbers of grid box months according to rainfall amount hence the bins range from the 5 driest months to the 5 wettest months to accurately represent the rainfall distribution in each bin the means and standard deviations were calculated for the rainfall and other variables then et e c thro r and d all expressed as percentage of monthly rain were plotted against monthly p for present and future climates and future climate with present co2 concentrations see section 2 3 for more detail 3 results and discussion 3 1 upscale ensemble outputs and jules water balance outputs driven with upscale data 3 1 1 present to future changes spatial distributions across the entire west african domain the upscale multi year mean summer jjas near surface meteorological conditions from present 1985 2011 to future 2085 2111 predict air temperature increases of 4 9 c with the greatest increases over the sahara fig 3a a zone of decreased atmospheric air pressures fig 3d we find increased air pressures in the coastal zones with predicted increases in the meridional gradients over the sahel here defined as 10 15 n the enhanced saharan heat low perturbs large scale summer circulation under future climate with increased monsoon winds the model runs also indicate zonal winds are increased particularly over the sahara while the meridional winds are increased across much of west africa particularly over the eastern sahel but reduced over the western sahel fig 3e f these findings fit with those of cook and vizy 2015 who used three reanalyses of 1 5 resolution era interim ncep 2 and merra and two observational datasets of 0 5 cru and ghcn for 1979 2012 to show that the sahara temperature has increased 2 4 times faster than the tropical mean strengthening the summertime heat low and african easterly jet while weakening the wintertime anticyclone and low level harmattan winds near surface specific atmospheric humidity fig 3b is also projected to increase consistent with higher temperatures and stronger monsoon winds carrying more moisture originating from the gulf of guinea for future climates net shortwave radiation fig 3g is reduced over most of the sahel indicating that cloud coverage has increased surface albedo was kept constant between present and future however net shortwave radiation has increased in parts of the west between 10 and 12 n and in the coastal region around the gulf of guinea which has increased winds from the north bringing in drier air masses with fewer clouds this is also apparent from the reductions in rainfall for future climate conditions see fig 4a net longwave radiation fig 3h is increased over most of the area except for a small area in the west coinciding with the area of increased net shortwave radiation future longwave radiation will be increased as a result of the higher air temperatures causing increased values of downwelling radiation from the atmosphere and clouds based on stefan boltzmann s law l ε a σ t a 4 with ε a the atmospheric emissivity and σ the stefan boltzmann constant note however that the increase in downwelling longwave radiation will be countered in part by increased upwelling longwave radiation from the land surface caused by reductions in total actual et see fig 4c atmospheric emissivity and hence net longwave radiation also depends on cloud cover type of clouds air temperature and humidity so the changes in these variables will have moderated the extent of the increase in net longwave radiation although we are not presenting a figure of cloud cover fig 4a showing the changes in precipitation between present and future climate implies that changes in cloud cover will be variable across the region total net radiation i e net shortwave plus net longwave radiation is generally increased fig 3i as the increase in net longwave radiation is greater than the decrease in net shortwave radiation values for pet see section 2 1 for details on its calculation are also predicted to increase under future climates only positive changes are shown in fig 3c largely as a result of increased temperatures fig 3a and net radiation fig 3i increased pet means atmospheric water demand will be greater in the future but present to future changes in actual et see fig 4c and table 1 will be modulated by changes in the availability of soil water and by changes in atmospheric co2 concentration via the co2 fertilisation effect both affect t via root water uptake and plant physiological feedbacks that dictate the degree of stomatal opening future annual p fig 4a is increased in the central southwest and northeast regions of west africa 12 2 in east sahel 6 9 in northern ghana and 8 9 in southern burkina faso sub regions table 1 but reduced in the south and west 13 5 in west sahel a pattern consistent with the change in summer large scale circulation due to the enhanced heat low see fig 3d f kamga et al 2005 found that increased atmospheric moisture and stronger meridional winds would lead to a wetter sahel in the late 21st century our findings show a wetter eastern sahel but a drier western sahel the change in the spatial pattern of rainfall presented in fig 4a is similar to the multi model cmip5 mean described by roehrig et al 2013 and diallo et al 2016 and also to the predictions of gaetani et al 2020 the increases in p high fig 4b are greater than those for total p over large areas and heavy rain is even increased for many areas in the south where the total is reduced showing that rainfall becomes more intense under future climatic conditions table 2 shows that in the future p high is a greater fraction of the total p in all six sub regions with increases ranging between 4 and 11 row 1 in table 2 compared to the present climate sylla et al 2015 and fitzpatrick et al 2020 also predict more intense rainfall events due to stronger moisture convergence in the future total et which includes interception evaporation as well as the sum of e s and t what jules calls the evaporation from the soil compartment is predicted to decrease across large areas in the west and south of west africa fig 4c despite the increased p and pet values fig 3c under future climate conditions et is projected to decrease considerably for west sahel by nearly 20 and somewhat for northern and southern ghana whereas it increases between 2 and 6 for the other regions within all six sub regions et p is reduced by 1 7 see table 2 e s t see fig 4d is reduced over large areas whereas e c fig 4e is generally slightly increased due to the greater rainfall and increased pet but not in the eastern sahel where rainfall is reduced the decreased evaporation from the soil compartment is most likely mainly due to reduced t as this is generally the largest component in et the near surface soil moisture contents ξ 0 0 1 m fig 4f are reduced over most of west africa and in most sub regions table 1 row 3 in particular for the west sahel where rainfall is decreased also in the future e s t which is predominantly composed of t is reduced despite the higher ξ 0 3 m values fig 4i and table 1 indicating that reduced t is not caused by increased plant water stress as this would occur if soil moisture contents were reduced rather reduced transpiration in the future is caused by the concurrent climatic feedbacks relating to physical variables as well as increased co2 concentration affecting photosynthesis and lowering stomatal conductance see e g kirschbaum and mcmillan 2018 surface runoff r and potential groundwater recharge d fig 4g h overall show modest to relatively large increases note that these changes are not statistically significant over the northern parts of the west african domain the projected changes in r vary between a decrease of 10 west sahel to an increase of 40 s burkina faso mainly because of the larger amount of rain falling during heavy events see table 2 this causes increased r particularly where surfaces are bare or sparsely vegetated interestingly d is predicted to increase in all regions apart from northern burkina faso where the model simulates d 0 for present climate and for some regions quite dramatically e g northern ghana 145 south burkina faso 333 and east sahel 110 this is largely related to an increase in ξ 0 3 m fig 4i that goes up by between 2 5 and 14 for future climate conditions table 1 as a result of increased p et values demonstrating a shift in the water stored in the soil between present and future climate mainly as a result of reduced root water uptake increased values of ξ 0 3 m cause soil hydraulic conductivity to increase which in turn increases potential groundwater recharge however values of r p barely change in most sub regions by about 2 5 maximally for potential recharge in southern ghana row 3 table 2 in contrast future d p increases considerably under future climate conditions bold numbers in table 2 whereas under the present climate conditions d takes up anywhere between 0 and 16 of total rainfall in the future this is 1 20 with a doubling from 5 to 10 in northern ghana and east sahel part of the shift in water balance is caused by a greater proportion of the increased rainfall passing through the canopy as throughfall thro see also fig 6a b rather than evaporating from there ec and reaching the soil surface where it then either runs off or infiltrates into the soil the values of ec p are slightly reduced over burkina faso and east sahel in table 2 note that et is also inhibited during rain due to reduced solar radiation and increased humidity which allows more of the water to infiltrate the soil future rainfall amounts show moderate changes of between 13 5 west sahel and 12 2 east sahel in table 1 3 1 2 present to future changes effects of plant physiological response and vegetation cover for improved understanding of the future changes in water balance the separate effects of the physical meteorological driving variables and the plant physiological response to increased co2 were examined by using the jules runs with future climate but with co2 concentrations kept at present levels see section 2 3 the results are presented in fig 5 and tables 1 and 2 also the influence of vegetation cover on the terrestrial water balance was considered see tables 3 and 4 with just the changes in meteorology the climate effect fig 5 left plots total et changes fig 5d are largely resulting from the changes in p as illustrated by a very similar spatial patterns of rainfall increase fig 4a changes in ξ 0 3 m fig 5g also roughly reflect the rainfall pattern while r and d fig 5a j show increases well inland between 9 and 13 n where the greatest increases in heavy rainfall 16 mm day occur fig 4b whereas regions to the west and south have reduced potential recharge in south burkina faso and east sahel et does not increase as much as rainfall leading to increased ξ 0 3 m between 1 and 4 table 1 and to slightly increased r p values compared to present climate 0 4 and d 0 7 table 2 the increases in ξ 0 3 m and d despite the increased pet see fig 3c are driven by increased rainfall with just the increase in co2 for future climatic conditions the co2 effect fig 5 middle e s t and hence total et fig 5e is reduced across west africa which confirms that reduced total et is largely due to the vegetation co2 response ξ 0 3 m r and d fig 5h b k are increased across west africa because less water is removed from the soil by plant roots as stomatal opening and therefore transpiration is reduced these observations hold in all sub regions tables 1 and 2 with d p further increased by between 3 and 5 of the total rainfall comparing mixed vegetation to uniform c4 grass representing crops such as sorghum and maize the land cover effect water balance differences are subtle with slight increases in total et across most of west africa fig 5f and mostly small reductions in ξ 0 3 m r and d fig 5i c l the exception is the sahara where soil moisture reductions are large under the previously bare ground and the soil moisture changes are generally more significant evaporation is increased by 1 2 in the sub regions reducing ξ 0 3 m content by 2 5 though ξ 0 0 1 m is increased apart from northern ghana by between 5 and 29 table 3 r is reduced by 1 when expressed as fraction of the rainfall and potential recharge by 1 table 4 when the land cover is changed from mixed vegetation to c4 grass the changes and the absolute values of the flux partitioning in table 4 correspond well with those shown in table 2 for present conditions even though only one present climate ensemble member was used to produce the results in table 4 this indicates the robustness of the individual upscale ensemble members these changes show greater water uptake by the c4 grass representing crops going from mixed vegetation to uniform broadleaf trees results in little change in total et in the central sub regions despite the increase in e c and ξ 0 3 m by 2 4 slightly increased r and only slight changes in d 3 1 3 spatiotemporal dependencies of the water balance fluxes on rainfall amount and frequency the dependence of the water balance flux partitioning on rainfall amount and frequency is examined more closely by taking values for each individual summer month for each grid square in the sub regions of northern ghana and southern burkina faso and arranging these by amount of rainfall fig 6a b shows that thro increases from 80 of p in the driest summer months to 96 in the wettest months this indicates that proportionally less water evaporates from the canopy during the wettest months as is also apparent from the decrease in e c lowest line in these plots the fractions allocated to thro only depend on the amount of rain with the same relationship for present and future climate so allocation to thro is predicted to increase slightly in the future as rainfall increases with an increase in monthly rainfall the fraction of et goes from an average of 100 of the monthly rainfall or more for individual gridcells with the additional water coming from the water already stored in the soil to only 20 30 partly due to the suppression of et during rainfall and during conditions of high relative humidity contributions of monthly rainfall to r and d are near zero in the driest months but can be greater than 25 and 45 of the rainfall respectively in the wettest months fig 6c f from present blue lines in fig 6 to future meteorological conditions red lines for present co2 and black lines for future co2 both the mean values and the standard deviations of the highest monthly rainfall values increase rainfall ranges also shown at the top of fig 6c d this is important since vellinga et al 2016 found that most inter annual variability is from changes in organised heavy rainfall events if co2 concentration remains unchanged red lines the higher temperatures and resulting pet lead to greater et although because of the increase in the highest monthly rainfalls et represents a smaller portion of the rain when going from present to future meteorology at present co2 concentrations red lines the fraction allocated to r fig 6c d is slightly increased in low rainfall months but reduced in high rainfall months while the contribution to d fig 6e f is slightly reduced in low rainfall months but increased in high rainfall months although the changes are small compared to the increase in et fraction at future co2 combined with future meteorological conditions black lines the fraction of monthly rainfall allocated to d is generally increased and the ratio r p slightly increased as t and hence overall et is reduced due to the plant response to increased co2 causing stomata to close it is expected that high rainfall leads to increased d because of higher ξ 0 3 m fig 4i fig 6e f shows that this effect is amplified by greater allocation of p to d during high rainfall months under future climate and increased co2 conditions this is even more evident with high rainfall months associated with significantly greater allocation to d than in present climate when co2 is held at present levels however the allocation to d under future meteorological conditions is similar to that under present conditions unless p 350 mm month 1 this suggests that the main driver of increased allocation of p to d is decreased t and hence reduced extraction of moisture from the soil column any effect of intensification of rainfall between present and future climate on e c is not evident fig 6a b only the total amount of rain the importance of reduced t for increased d is not highlighted by many studies on the impact of climate change on groundwater resources with intensification of rainfall considered the primary driver taylor et al 2013 however it should be noted that the jules model does not incorporate the process of focussed recharge in areas where surface runoff concentrates a process which is likely to become more important for groundwater recharge with rainfall intensification jasechko and taylor 2015 cuthbert et al 2019 comparing the sub regions of northern ghana fig 6 left column and southern burkina faso fig 6 right column the dependencies on monthly rainfall climate and co2 concentration are similar but overall the allocation to et is greater and the allocations to r and d less in the hotter climate of burkina faso table 2 shows the overall mean allocations in these sub regions similarly the effects of land cover on the dependency of the monthly water balance components on monthly rainfall are examined in fig 7 by using the jules runs with uniform vegetation one of the present climate upscale ensemble members with present co2 uniform broadleaf tree cover leads to slightly increased proportions of monthly rainfall allocated to e c due to the taller canopy which increases turbulence and higher leaf area index reduced et especially in southern burkina faso and slightly greater r and d values than for the mixed vegetation coverage northern ghana a simulated land use change to uniform c4 grass cover also gives slightly increased e c though not as much as for the trees but increased et and slightly lower d compared to the mixed coverage though again these are only minor effects at high monthly rainfall amounts the et p ratios converge tables 3 and 4 show the overall mean changes in these sub regions 3 1 4 present to future changes seasonal variations and shifts analysis of seasonality focusses on the region delineated by 5 w to 5 e and 4 21 n air temperatures are increased throughout the year from present to future climate with enhanced meridional gradients in temperature and surface pressure from late spring to early autumn fig 8a and d many of the variables in fig 8 show a northwards progression during spring to give the greatest increases over the north in the summer followed by a southward retreat in the autumn for humidity pet and wind there are reduced values of net shortwave radiation implying greater cloud cover for most of the year and latitudes but increases during the summer months for the southern half implying less cloud net longwave radiation has increased over the entire domain in particular during autumn and winter whereas total net radiation is increased particularly in late spring total rainfall is slightly increased in late spring reduced in early summer then increased in late summer and autumn fig 9a in the south rainfall is reduced over most of the year then increased in autumn while heavy rain fig 9b is reduced in june and july between 5 and 7 n but increased particularly in august and september between 9 and 12 n the pattern of temporal and spatial changes shows that the monsoon occurs later in summer and moves northwards in the future climate ibrahim et al 2014 used simulated rainfall data produced by five regional climate models under the a1b scenario over two periods 1971 2000 as reference period and 2021 2050 as projection period and found that the rainy season onset is projected by all models to be delayed by one week on average sylla et al 2015 also predict a delay in the monsoon onset values of e s t see fig 9d mainly the result of decreased transpiration is generally reduced in the future climate except in the north in late spring and late summer while changes in e c fig 9e follow the changes in total rainfall as expected r fig 9g is reduced in the south 4 9 n from march to october but increased between 9 and 12 n in august and september d fig 9h is reduced between 4 and 8 n from june to november but increased between 9 and 13 n from august to october ξ 0 0 1 m fig 9f is generally reduced throughout the year while ξ 0 3 m fig 9i is generally greater particularly between 9 and 13 n from october to june but less in the south 4 7 n from june to november 4 conclusions analysis of outputs from the global high resolution climate model upscale has shown significant changes for the future monsoon in the west africa region with higher temperatures over land particularly in the sahara increased atmospheric humidity and increased cloud cover leading to greater net radiation this results in an enhanced saharan heat low in summer with greater south north temperature and pressure gradients in west africa and an altered large scale circulation pattern greater overall rainfall is predicted within the region due to higher atmospheric humidity and stronger monsoon winds with the summer wind direction coming more from the north over the western sahel leading to reduced rainfall but more from the south over the eastern sahel leading to increased rainfall the monsoon is predicted to move further to the north and both its onset and end will occur later in the summer for future climates the higher air temperatures and increased humidity under future climatic conditions lead to more intense rain for large parts of west africa in particular the central and north eastern parts jules runs driven with the upscale atmospheric output show that for the north eastern parts of west africa increased future rainfall results in increased evapotranspiration surface runoff soil moisture content and potential recharge however with regards to the partitioning of the rainfall received the fraction of total evapotranspiration et including interception evaporation ec is reduced as rainfall increases partly due to the suppression of all evaporation and an increasing fraction going to throughfall this results in greater fractions of the rainfall going to surface runoff and infiltrating into the soil layers resulting in increased potential recharge sensitivity experiments in which atmospheric co2 is kept at present levels while the other atmospheric conditions are representative of future climates suggest that the primary driver of projected increased potential recharge is reduced transpiration with the increase in rainfall a secondary factor changing vegetation type does appear to have a strong effect on potential recharge while the results appear robust we acknowledge that differences in model structure and hydraulic parameter selection can affect water balance flux partitioning see also sorensen et al 2014 and weihermüller et al 2021 however we are currently conducting local level runs with models such as the swap model van dam et al 2008 to study the water balance in this region in more detail and our findings broadly confirm the results of this paper furthermore the large scale jules setup assumes uniform diffuse movement of water through the subsurface and does not allow the accumulation of water within topographic depressions which facilitates focussed groundwater recharge focussed recharge is also likely to increase in line with predicted surface runoff although predominantly due to increases in projected rainfall taylor et al 2013 cuthbert et al 2019 potential increases in groundwater recharge are important as the greater development of groundwater resources is considered as a
