21390,in this study the weathervane performance of floating offshore wind turbines fowts moored by single point mooring spm system is assessed through a series of experiments and numerically simulating time series history two types of scaled fowt models a semi submersible and a spar are designed and manufactured based on froude s scaling law the 1 200 scaled models are experimented in a circulating water tank at osaka prefecture university osaka japan under only wind and wind current conditions a time series numerical simulation technique modeling wind current and mooring loads is developed damping coefficients are determined from the experiments and used in the simulation the equation of motion is set up and solved numerically using runge kutta gill method a good agreement was found between experimental and numerical simulation results further the influence of slow drift motion of fowt resulting from the weathervane is clarified by comparing the numerical simulation results with and without damping force it was found that accurate predictions were possible by considering the slow drift damping of fowt than the numerical simulation without damping although the effect of damping is found to be nominal it can be concluded that estimation of slow drift damping is needed for accurate prediction of weathervane phenomenon 1 introduction floating offshore wind turbines fowts are attracting attention worldwide as a promising alternative to generate clean energy and reduce carbon footprint in japan various projects about the fowts are underway including the fukushima floating wind farm demonstration project ishihara 2015 funded by the ministry of economy trade and industry of japan wind turbines normally weathervane using the yaw control system inside the nacelle however the yaw control system is found to be one of the major reasons for the failure of wind turbines pfaffel et al 2017 a vane anemometer failure or power failure due to a storm or lightning make it difficult to control the yaw direction stability this may result in overspinning of blades leading to structural failure and loss of public property especially in the case of fowts when the yaw control system breaks down it becomes all the more difficult to repair at sea and if the failure is severe the wind turbine needs to be towed back to docks and this in turn increases maintenance costs a new idea is devised by some of the present authors in a previous study to address this and eliminate the yaw control system for fowts with the use of a single point mooring spm system nihei et al 2018 spm system consists of a buoy with a rotation mechanism such as a bearing and a connection the fowt is attached to the buoy moored to the seabed through the connection which allows the floater to rotate around the buoy by introducing spm system it becomes possible for fowts to follow the wind direction by using wind force alone and as a result the yaw control system can be eliminated the rotation mechanism acts at the bottom of the tower improving the top heaviness and leads to easier installation in addition there is an advantage that the buoy and fowt can be attached and detached easily when the fowt needs to be towed back to docks on the other hand it poses technical challenges related to operation in the real sea area under environmental loads especially the ocean current greatly affects the stability and weathervane performance of spm fowts various researches have been conducted over the recent years related to weathervaning and yaw stability of spm fowts yaw stability is depended on combination of wind wave and current loads murai et al 2014 conducted an experimental study on wind following response of single point mooring type offshore wind turbine iijima et al 2015 compared weathervane performance of two types of fowt systems moored to spm in wind only conditions kusanagi et al 2018 found out about the slewing phenomenon of multiple floaters attached to spm when acted upon by wind all the above researches concentrated on wind as the primary load while addressing weathervane performance srinivasamurthy et al 2019 made a preliminary attempt at understanding the weathervane and stability of spm fowts due to wind current coexistence through eigenvalue analysis further experiments were carried out by hollyhead et al 2017 investigating the current induced motion of a lifeboat at a single point mooring the results showed that the dominant translational motion of the model lifeboat is sway and the rotational motion is yaw with double pendulum like fishtailing behavior aranha et al 2001 addressed the stability of a weathervane ship tanker in wave and current action the equilibrium of the ship tanker free to rotate around a vertical axis was verified using wave drift damping formula weathervane control studies of offloading operation between a fpso and a connected tanker conducted by kim et al 2016 2017 showed weathervaning control enables each vessel to be oriented towards the direction of the mean environmental force induced by wind wave and ocean current so as to improve the operational safety miyazaki and tannuri 2012 also proposed a general approach for dp weathervane control based on wave and current estimation however the weathervaning control is not the target for spm fowts but the resultant direction and orientation needs to be evaluated for optimum solution of single point moorings to offshore wind turbines the yaw motion analysis of fpso turret dynamic study under wave drift forces on regular wave conditions was conducted by sanchez mondragon et al 2018 this knowledge can also be utilized while designing spm fowts for evaluating yaw stability conditions spm fowts are multifaceted and mooring line response is a vital component of design for operation at sea stanisic et al 2018 conducted study on long term distribution of a catenary type mooring line response of a large weathervaning vessel in a tropical cyclone environment dynamic behavior of a single point moored submersible fish cage under currents was investigated by decew et al 2010 they concluded that the distribution of current throughout the water column plays an important role in the steady state response of the structure schellin 2003 analyzed the mooring load of two single point moored tanker ships in a steady current and comparative simulated time histories of the mooring load were analyzed ye and ji 2019 discussed the dynamic response of a spar type direct drive wind turbine subjected to current wave and wind interactions the misalignment of the sea current and wind wave direction was examined with the help of time history simulation newman 1993 studied the low frequency oscillatory motions of floating bodies for wave field and confirmed the wave drift damping faltinsen and sortland 1987 discussed the damping coefficients for slow drift oscillations of a moored ship in irregular waves from the above discussions we can understand that there are limited experimental studies on spm fowts under wind current coexisting field and physical phenomenon needs to be evaluated also most studies related to damping addresses the high frequency wave component in the case spm fowts it is therefore desired to simulate and understand the slow drifting motion of fowt resulting from weathervane phenomenon in this paper slow drift damping is clarified under the interaction of wind and current systematically two types of fowts spar type and semi submersible type are considered and weathervane performance in the wind current coexisting field is addressed further added mass and damping coefficients are determined by fluid resistance test and forced oscillation yaw test a numerical simulation technique is developed using runge kutta gill method and compared with the experimental results the basic framework of this study is to understand the mechanisms by scaled model experimentation and numerical simulations 2 scaled model of fowts in this section the detail of scaled models of fowts used in experiments are explained the 5 mw wind turbine are scaled down to 1 200 scale the scaled models are designed and manufactured based on froude scaling law in this study scaling of geometrical dimensions and shape as well as dynamic properties including rated thrust of the fowt is carried out 2 1 wind turbine scaled model the wind turbine model refers to the 5 mw wind turbine designed by nrel jonkman et al 2009 fig 1 shows the scaled model of the wind turbine this model is made of urethane and frp fibre reinforced plastic table 1 shows the principal particulars of the wind turbine scaled model wind turbine has three blades and they rotate during experiment the aerodynamic characteristics of naca4412 are targeted while crafting the blades 2 2 spar type model fig 2 shows the scaled model of spar type the spar type scaled model is designed considering the stability and constructability natural period for wave period etc this scaled model consists of combination of several acrylic columns the spar type has a middle column and a ballast column the middle column plays a role in raising the center of buoyancy and lowering the draft for application in intermediate water depth the ballast column plays a role in lowering the center of gravity improving the stability of the fowt the spar type floater is attached to the buoy with bearing on the top through the rigid bar the buoy is moored by tension leg mooring therefore the spar type floater can rotate around the buoy the distance from the spar type floater to buoy is 10 0 cm table 2 shows the principal particular of spar type the scaled model weighs about 800 g which corresponds to about 6400 tons in real scale and the draft of scaled model corresponds to 100 m in real scale 2 3 semi submersible type model fig 3 shows the scaled model of semi submersible type this model is designed and manufactured based on the model proposed by osaka university iijima et al 2015 this scaled model consists of three columns and a lower hull the columns play a role in improving the stability of this model and lower hull provides integrity in fixing these three columns and lowering the center of gravity two columns of semi submersible type are connected to the buoy with bearing on the top through a rigid yoke structure the buoy is moored by tension leg mooring then semi submersible type floater can rotate around the buoy the distance from the column housing the wind turbine to the buoy is 512 3 mm table 3 shows the principal particular of semi submersible floater the scaled model weighs about 1 7 kg which corresponds to about 13 600 tons in real scale 3 numerical simulation in this section numerical simulation methodology is explained the simulation considers the 3 dof motions in the horizontal plane the spm fowt system is considered as a combination of two rigid bodies of a fowt with a connecting bar and a mooring buoy the two rigid bodies are assumed to be connected by a bearing with friction also this simulation considers wind current and mooring as external forces 3 1 equation of motion the equation of motion is introduced as two rigid bodies fowt with a connecting bar and a mooring buoy fig 4 shows the coordinate systems of this model the mooring buoy is expressed in an absolute coordinate system in an inertial frame as in fig 4 a fowt is attached to the center of mooring buoy and the yawing motion of the fowt is considered in a non inertial frame as shown in fig 4 b in fig 4 a g b x b y b is the buoy center and ψ b is the yaw angle of the mooring buoy in fig 4 b g t is the center of gravity of the fowt with connecting bar and ψ t is the yaw angle of fowt the mooring buoy motion of equation in surge sway and yaw directions can be written as 1 m b d 2 x b d t 2 t x f b c x f t b r cos ψ t f t b ψ sin ψ t 2 m b d 2 y b d t 2 t y f b c y f t b r sin ψ t f t b ψ cos ψ t 3 i b d 2 ψ b d t 2 t m m t b where m b and i b are the mass and the moment of inertia of the mooring buoy t x t y are the forces in the x and y directions and t m is the yaw moment acting on the buoy due to mooring f b c x and f b c y are the forces in the x and y directions acting on the buoy due to current f t b r and f t b ψ are respectively the axial and tangential internal force between the mooring buoy and the fowt m t b is the moment caused due to friction of the bearing on the mooring buoy the equation of motion for the fowt with connecting bar in axial force equilibrium and tangential moment equilibrium directions can be written as 4 f t w r f t c r f t b r m t d 2 x b d t 2 cos ψ t m t d 2 y b d t 2 sin ψ t 0 5 i t i t a d 2 ψ t d t 2 b d ψ t d t f t w ψ l 2 f t c ψ l 3 m w m t b m t d 2 x b d t 2 l 1 sin ψ t m t d 2 y b d t 2 l 1 cos ψ t where m t is the mass of the fowt with connecting bar i t and i t a are the moment of inertia and additional moment of inertia of the fowt with connecting bar b is the slow drift damping coefficient of the fowt f t w r f t w ψ are the forces in the axial and tangential directions and m w is the yaw moment acting on the fowt due to wind f t c r and f t c ψ are axial and tangential current force acting on the sub structure body part below the free water surface of the fowt l 1 is the distance between g b and g t l 2 is the distance between g b and the point of action of wind force l 3 is the distance between g b and the point of action of current force it can be seen that the coordinate system of the floating body is in non inertial frame and moves with the mooring buoy in other words when the mooring buoy moves with acceleration inertial force is applied to the floating wind turbine therefore the inertial force of mooring buoy is taken into consideration in this equation of motion the fourth and fifth terms on the left side of eq 4 and the fifth and sixth terms on the right side of eq 5 are the inertial terms associated with the acceleration motion of the mooring buoy 3 2 modeling of wind force the wind load on the wind turbine varies by the angle of attack of the wind in this study the wind load measured by a dynamometer is applied to the simulation the wind loads f t w r n f t w ψ n and m z n m see fig 5 at wind speed of 2 2 m s are measured for different inflow angles with change interval of 15 figs 6 and 7 show the measured wind thrust loads and moment respectively the point between measurement points is interpolated by spline where c d w is drag coefficient ρ a kg m3 is air density v w is wind speed of 2 2 m s a w m2 is projected area of wind turbine assuming that c d w ρ a and a w are constant wind load f w at relative wind speed v w is given as 7 f w f w v w 2 v w 2 the yaw moment m z on the wind turbine is also given as follows 8 m z m z v w 2 v w 2 the relative wind speed v w and inflow relative angle θ w considering the movement of mooring buoy and fowt is given as follows 9 v w v w r v w ψ v w 0 cos φ w ψ t u cos ψ t v sin ψ t v w 0 sin φ w ψ t u sin ψ t v cos ψ t r t l 2 10 θ w tan 1 v w ψ v w r where v w 0 is absolute wind speed u v are the linear velocities in x and y directions of the mooring buoy as defined in fig 4 a and r t is the angular velocity of the fowt as defined in fig 4 b therefore wind force is given as 11 f t w r f w sin θ w f t w ψ f w cos θ w 3 3 modeling of current force in this study current force is assumed as follows 12 f c 1 2 c d ρ w v c 2 a c where c d is drag coefficient ρ w kg m3 is water density v c is relative current speed a c m2 is projected area under the water the relative current speed v c and inflow relative angle θ c considering the movement of buoy and fowt is given as follows 13 v c v c r v c ψ v c 0 cos φ c ψ t u cos ψ t v sin ψ t v c 0 sin φ c ψ t u sin ψ t v cos ψ t r t l 3 14 θ c tan 1 v c ψ v c r 15 f t c r f c sin θ c f t c ψ f c cos θ c 3 4 modeling of mooring force in the experiment the buoy is moored by four cables and anchor the mooring force acted by i th mooring t i n is assumed as 16 t i k δ where k n m is the mooring coefficient and δ is displacement of i th mooring point of the buoy when the i th mooring point moves from initial mooring position x i y i to the position x i y i x i y i is given as 17 x i y i cos ψ b sin ψ b sin ψ b cos ψ b x i y i x b y b therefore the angle α i the mooring force t x i and t y i the moment t m i is given as follows 18 α i tan 1 y i y i x i x i 19 t x i t i cos α i t y i t i sin α i 20 t m i t i l i sin α i ψ b where l i is the distance between center of buoy and i th mooring point t x t y and t m can be calculated as the sum of the four moorings 21 t x y i 1 4 t x i y i t m i 1 4 t m i 3 5 modeling of bearing in the experiment a bearing is used as the rotation mechanism between the mooring buoy and fowt with connecting bar when the tangential internal force f t b ψ acts the friction moment of the bearing m t b is generated 22 m t b μ p d 2 where μ is the coefficient of friction d m is the nominal bearing inner diameter p is the resultant load acting on the bearing estimated as per eq 23 23 p f t b r 2 f t b ψ 2 when the axial internal force f t b r acts on the fowt the axial force of the same magnitude is generated as an internal force on the buoy when the yaw moment of the wind turbine m z act the tangential force f t b ψ is generated as an internal force 24 f t b ψ m z l 2 4 circulating water tank test 4 1 circulating water tank in this section the outline of the water tank tests using the 1 200 scaled model in wind and current coexisting field are explained a circulating water tank and a wind blower is set to generate current and wind figs 8 and 9 show the circulating water tank and wind blower used in the experiment the length breadth and depth of circulating water tank is respectively 4 5 1 5 and 1 0 m the circulating water channel is driven by a 4 bladed axial flow impeller and can achieve a working maximum velocity of 2 3 m s the wind blower consists of six fans and a control panel 4 2 experimental conditions of the forced oscillation yaw test in this study two tests i fluid resistance test and ii forced oscillation yaw test are carried out firstly in still water and then in current condition the purpose of these tests is to determine the loads on the floating model i e to obtain the added moment of inertia and damping coefficients and clarify the water load on the floating body a 1 200 scale floating model is used for experiments fig 10 shows the coordinate system of the test and the definitions of f x f y and m z measured when the floating model is subjected to forced yawing motion two kinds of fluid resistance test one by changing the yaw angle of the floating body and another by varying the current flow are conducted in the first test the current flow of 0 12 m s is kept constant and floating model angle ψ is changed by an interval of 15 further varying current flow test was performed with constant yaw angle of ψ 180 and flow rate of current is varied from 0 036 m s to 0 39 m s yaw angle for forced oscillation test in still water and in tidal current ψ was given by the following equation 25 ψ a sin 2 π t t b a sin ω t b where a rad is the amplitude of the yaw oscillation t s is the time period t s is the elapsed time b rad is the center of yawing and ω s is the angular frequency table 4 shows the conditions of the forced oscillation yaw test performed on the semi submersible type floating body and the spar type floating body 4 3 weathervaning experiment the experiment is conducted by changing the current speed and initial yaw angle wind and current are setup opposite to each other during experiment table 5 shows the conditions of the experiments the wind speed is fixed at 2 2 m s and it corresponds to the rated thrust value in real scale based on the froude scaling law this wind speed is obtained based on the experimental result of the scaled wind turbine model current speed of 3 69 cm s correspond to 1 0 knot in real scale fig 11 shows the initial yaw angle of fowts after the scale model is placed at each initial yaw angle wind and current are turned on and the weathervane performance is observed yaw angle of 180 is the final point where the downwind type fowt stabilize following the wind the measuring items used in the experiment are motion capture camera and tracker fig 12 shows the a motion capture camera and b tracker by irradiating light and measuring the reflection light from tracker with two cameras the 6 dof data can be obtained therefore it is possible to obtain time series data of motion 4 4 conditions of the numerical simulation table 6 shows the conditions of the numerical simulation runge kutta gill method is adopted in the simulation as the time history calculation method and the time step is 0 05 sec 5 experimental and simulation result 5 1 fluid resistance test the results of fluid resistance test when the flow velocity is changed with the yaw angle of floating body ψ set to 180 are shown in fig 13 for both semi submersible and spar type models the drag coefficient of the floating model is plotted with the varying current flow it can be seen that the drag coefficient of the semi submersible type and spar type floating bodies are almost constant about 1 15 and 1 05 respectively next fig 14 shows the change of the drag coefficient of the semi submersible type floating body when the yaw angle is changed since the shape of the spar type floating body is point symmetric the drag coefficient is assumed to be constant at all yaw angles and this test was not performed from fig 14 we can observe that the drag coefficient changes significantly when the yaw angle changes this is thought to be due to the shape of the lower hull below the water surface for the semi submersible type floating body at various yaw angle positions 5 2 forced oscillation yaw test still water condition hashimoto et al 2019 discussed the analysis methodology to obtain added moment of inertia and damping coefficient from the forced oscillation yaw test in this paper similar methodology is used and analysis of the water load in the forced oscillation yaw test is carried out the analysis technique is briefly shown here for the case of semi submersible type floating body the experiment condition is time period of 10 s and the amplitude of yaw oscillation 80 deg as an example the equation of motion in the yaw direction when the floating body oscillates can be expressed as follows 26 i i a ψ b ψ f y l c ψ m z where i kg m2 is the moment of inertia of the floating body i a kg m2 is the added moment of inertia b kg m2 s is the slow drift damping force coefficient and f y n is the drag force in y direction which is proportional to the square of the flow velocity the directional component l m is the distance from the center of rotation to the point of impact of the drag force and c kg m2 s2 is the restoring coefficient the left hand side of equation 26 is summarized as the inertia damping drag and restoring terms however in this study c is zero because only the motion in the yaw direction is considered also in still water the velocity v a m s of the fluid acting on the floating body is 27 v a l ψ the drag force f y on the floating body is expressed by the following equation using the water density ρ kg m3 and the wetted projected area of the floater s m2 28 f y 1 2 ρ s c d v a v a by subtracting this drag term obtained by the above calculation from the experiment result it becomes an equation consisting of only the inertia and the damping force terms equation 26 can be expressed as follows 29 i i a a ω 2 sin ω t b a ω cos ω t m z where m z is the resultant moment obtained by subtracting the yaw moment due to drag force from measured m z for convenience the obtained m z is converted into a periodic function by dft discrete fourier transform as shown in fig 15 and can be expressed as shown in equation 30 30 m z m sin ω t ε from equations 29 and 30 the added moment of inertia i a and damping force coefficient b can be obtained by the following equations 31 i a m a ω 2 cos ε i 32 b m a ω sin ε fig 16 shows the comparison of m z calculated using the obtained added moment of inertia and damping force coefficient with the measured m z during experiment and it is clear that they agree well therefore it can be said that the added moment of inertia and damping force coefficient can be obtained by the above analysis method using the above method we obtained the added moment of inertia and damping coefficients of semi submersible and spar type floating bodies from forced yawing test results table 7 summarizes the coefficients used to obtain them it is noted here that c d 1 36 is used for the semi submersible type floating body corresponding to yaw angle of 90 see fig 14 the calculated added moment of inertia of the semi submersible type and the spar type are shown in figs 17 and 18 respectively from fig 17 it can be seen that the added moment of inertia of the semi submersible type floating body is a constant value of about 0 2 0 24 kg m2 in addition fig 18 shows that the added moment of inertia of the spar type floating body fluctuates slightly but is in the range of approximately 0 004 0 006 kg m2 in both cases the sum of the moment of inertia and the added moment of inertia is almost constant and it can be assumed that the value of the added moment of inertia is constant next figs 19 22 show the damping force coefficient of the semi submersible type and the spar type floating bodies for varying amplitudes and angular frequencies tested damping coefficient variation with the angular frequency figs 20 and 22 is shown for turning amplitude of 90 figs 19 and 20 show that the damping force coefficient of the semi submersible type floating body is proportional to the amplitude and angular frequency figs 21 and 22 show that the damping force coefficient of the spar type floating body is proportional to the angular frequency but not to the amplitude an approximate expression was derived using the obtained damping force coefficient determined by the amplitude and angular frequency and the value was used in the numerical simulation 5 3 forced oscillation yaw test current condition the method of analysing the water load in the current condition is explained below fig 23 shows the coordinate system of the floating body in current therefore the relative flow velocity v a and the inflow angle ϕ ca are 35 v a v a x 2 v a y 2 36 φ c a tan 1 v a y v a x then the drag force received by the floating body due to current is as follows 37 f c 1 2 ρ v a 2 s c d therefore the hydrodynamic load f y in the y direction is as follows 38 f y f c sin φ c a using the drag term obtained from above the added moment of inertia and the damping force coefficient obtained in the forced oscillation yaw test in still water the load due to water was calculated fig 24 shows the comparison between experimental and calculated values of m z in the current condition from fig 24 the water load can be reproduced even in the current condition and it can be said that the damping force coefficient is not greatly affected by current 5 4 only wind condition results figs 25 and 26 show the experimental and simulation result of the semi submersible type and the spar type the fowt start rotating around the mooring buoy at initial angle of 0 and aligns itself with the wind direction to final position at around 180 the green line shows the calculation result without damping force and red line shows the calculation result with damping force it is noted that the damping force here is due to the slow drift motion of the fowt about the single point mooring and therefore the numerical simulation with damping investigates the effect of slow drift damping condition both of the models can follow the wind direction finely and it can be said that the models attain stability comparing the experimental results of semi submersible and spar it can be seen that semi submersible model aligns with the wind direction around 25 s fig 25 black line and spar model aligns with the wind direction around 8 s fig 26 black line it can be concluded that the spar model follows the wind faster than semi submersible model in the case of semi submersible model simulation with damping red line aligns with the wind direction around 23 s and seen to be closer to experimental result black line the path of aligning with wind direction from 0 to 23 s is predicted well by simulation with damping force when compared with the experiment result simulation without damping green line is found to have slow oscillation motion about the final position 180 and aligns completely with wind around 45 s of the simulation also if we consider the overshoot angle it is about 190 and 183 for the simulation result without and with damping respectively in the case of spar model from fig 26 the overshoot angle of about 200 and 185 can be observed for simulation without and with damping force respectively from these discussions it can be said that the simulation with damping force shows better result than the simulation without damping it can also be seen that simulation result with damping force can predict the experiment result well therefore the damping force affects the yaw motion of the fowt and to predict the yawing of the fowt accurately the slow drift damping force needs to be considered however in both of the simulation fowt follow the wind direction a little faster than the experiment this can be because the damping force becomes larger due to the wave generated by the wind or the model of the friction force may not express the real phenomena well 5 5 wind current coexisting condition results in this section wind current coexisting condition is considered figs 27 and 28 show the experimental and simulation results of spar type and semi submersible type in the wind current coexisting condition current speed is 3 69 cm s the green line shows the calculation result without damping force and red line shows the calculation result with damping force it can be observed that both of the models can follow the wind direction well in wind current condition semi submersible and spar models align with the wind direction around 40 s and 10 s respectively comparing the simulation results with and without damping force the simulation result with damping force shows better result than the result without damping even in current condition the path of fowt which is aligning with the wind direction can be predicted well using simulation with damping especially the simulation result with damping fig 28 red line of spar model matches finely when compared with the experiment result fig 28 black line 6 conclusion in this study weathervane performance of two types of fowts moored by spm system in the wind current coexisting field is understood by scaled model experiments and numerical simulation the experiment is conducted using 1 200 scaled models of spar and semi submersible type based on froude s scaling law and the numerical simulation program is developed assuming the spm fowts modelled as two rigid bodies the influence of slow drift damping on weathervaning is confirmed by comparing the simulation results with and without using damping coefficients following specific conclusions can be derived it is found from fluid resistance test that the drag coefficient of semi submersible type floating body changes significantly depending on the yaw angle position of the floater this is due to the shape of the lower hull below the water surface for the semi submersible type floating body at various yaw angle positions and this is an important parameter to understand weathervane phenomenon the water load due to the weathervane is evaluated from forced oscillation yaw test both in still water and current conditions an example case of the methodology is shown for the semi submersible model and is validated by comparing the experiment and calculation results it is also confirmed that the water load can be reproduced even in current condition added moment of inertia and damping force coefficient of spar and semi submersible floating bodies is estimated for varying amplitudes and angular frequencies in forced oscillation test it is found that the added moment of inertia is approximately constant for both the models with regards to the damping force coefficient both the models behave differently the damping force coefficient of the semi submersible floater is proportional to both amplitude and angular frequency whereas the damping force coefficient of the spar floater is proportional only to the angular frequency of oscillation but not to the amplitude it is found from the result of the experiment and simulation the fowts follows the wind direction and performs weathervane both in only wind and wind current conditions simulation result with damping force can predict the weathervane phenomenon accurately than the simulation result without damping for both spar and semi submersible models therefore it can be concluded that slow drift damping force evaluation is necessary for understanding the weathervane phenomenon of spm fowts credit authorship

fowts are attracting attention worldwide as a promising alternative to generate clean energy and reduce carbon footprint in japan various projects about the fowts are underway including the fukushima

2018 spm system consists of a buoy with a rotation mechanism such as a bearing and a connection the fowt is attached to the buoy moored to the seabed through the connection which allows the floater to rotate around the buoy by introducing spm system it becomes possible for fowts to follow the wind direction by using wind force alone and as a result the yaw control system can be eliminated the rotation mechanism acts at the bottom of the tower improving the top heaviness and leads to easier installation in addition there is an advantage that the buoy and fowt can be attached and detached easily when the fowt needs to be towed back to docks on the other hand it poses technical challenges related to operation in the real sea area under environmental loads especially the ocean current greatly affects the stability and weathervane performance of spm fowts various researches have been conducted over the recent years related to weathervaning and yaw stability of spm fowts yaw stability is depended on combination of wind wave and current loads murai et al 2014 conducted an experimental study on wind following response of single point mooring type offshore wind turbine iijima et al 2015 compared weathervane performance of two types of fowt systems moored to spm in wind only conditions kusanagi et al 2018 found out about the slewing phenomenon of multiple floaters attached to spm when acted upon by wind all the above researches concentrated on wind as the primary load while addressing weathervane performance srinivasamurthy et al 2019 made a preliminary attempt at understanding the weathervane and stability of spm fowts due to wind current coexistence through eigenvalue analysis further experiments were carried out by hollyhead et al 2017 investigating the current induced motion of a lifeboat at a single point mooring the results showed that the dominant translational motion of the model lifeboat is sway and the rotational motion is yaw with double pendulum like fishtailing behavior aranha et al 2001 addressed the stability of a weathervane ship tanker in wave and current action the equilibrium of the ship tanker free to rotate around a vertical axis was verified using wave drift damping formula weathervane control studies of offloading operation between a fpso and a connected tanker conducted by kim et al 2016 2017 showed weathervaning control enables each vessel to be oriented towards the direction of the mean environmental force induced by wind wave and ocean current so as to improve the operational safety miyazaki and tannuri 2012 also proposed a general approach for dp weathervane control based on wave and current estimation however the weathervaning control is not the target for spm fowts but the resultant direction and orientation needs to be evaluated for optimum solution of single point moorings to offshore wind turbines the yaw motion analysis of fpso turret dynamic study under wave drift forces on regular wave conditions was conducted by sanchez mondragon et al 2018 this knowledge can also be utilized while designing spm fowts for evaluating yaw stability conditions spm fowts are multifaceted and mooring line response is a vital component of design for operation at sea stanisic et al 2018 conducted study on long term distribution of a catenary type mooring line response of a large weathervaning vessel in a tropical cyclone environment dynamic behavior of a single point moored submersible fish cage under currents was investigated by decew et al 2010 they concluded that the distribution of current throughout the water column plays an important role in the steady state response of the structure schellin 2003 analyzed the mooring load of two single point moored tanker ships in a steady current and comparative simulated time histories of the mooring load were analyzed ye and ji 2019 discussed the dynamic response of a spar type direct drive wind turbine subjected to current wave and wind interactions the misalignment of the sea current and wind wave direction was examined with the help of time history simulation newman 1993 studied the low frequency oscillatory motions of floating bodies for wave field and confirmed the wave drift damping faltinsen and sortland 1987 discussed the damping coefficients for slow drift oscillations of a moored ship in irregular waves from the above discussions we can understand that there are limited experimental studies on spm fowts under wind current coexisting field and physical phenomenon needs to be evaluated also most studies related to damping addresses the high frequency wave component in the case spm fowts it is therefore desired to simulate and understand the slow drifting motion of fowt resulting from weathervane phenomenon in this paper slow drift damping is clarified under the interaction of wind and current systematically two types of fowts spar type and semi submersible type are considered and weathervane performance in the wind current coexisting field is addressed further added mass and damping coefficients are determined by fluid resistance test and forced oscillation yaw test a numerical simulation technique is developed using runge kutta gill method and compared with the experimental results the basic framework of this study is to understand the mechanisms by scaled model experimentation and numerical simulations 2 scaled model of fowts in this section the detail of scaled models of fowts used in experiments are explained the 5 mw wind turbine are scaled down to 1 200 scale the scaled models are designed and manufactured based on froude scaling law in this study scaling of geometrical dimensions and shape as well as dynamic properties including rated thrust of the fowt is carried out 2 1 wind turbine scaled model the wind turbine model refers to the 5 mw wind turbine designed by nrel jonkman et al 2009 fig 1 shows the scaled model of the wind turbine this model is made of urethane and frp fibre reinforced plastic table 1 shows the principal particulars of the wind turbine scaled model wind turbine has three blades and they rotate during experiment the aerodynamic characteristics of naca4412 are targeted while crafting the blades 2 2 spar type model fig 2 shows the scaled model of spar type the spar type scaled model is designed considering the stability and constructability natural period for wave period etc this scaled model consists of combination of several acrylic columns the spar type has a middle column and a ballast column the middle column plays a role in raising the center of buoyancy and lowering the draft for application in intermediate water depth the ballast column plays a role in lowering the center of gravity improving the stability of the fowt the spar type floater is attached to the buoy with bearing on the top through the rigid bar the buoy is moored by tension leg mooring therefore the spar type floater can rotate around the buoy the distance from the spar type floater to buoy is 10 0 cm table 2 shows the principal particular of spar type the scaled model weighs about 800 g which corresponds to about 6400 tons in real scale and the draft of scaled model corresponds to 100 m in real scale 2 3 semi submersible type model fig 3 shows the scaled model of semi submersible type this model is designed and manufactured based on the model proposed by osaka university iijima et al 2015 this scaled model consists of three columns and a lower hull the columns play a role in improving the stability of this model and lower hull provides integrity in fixing these three columns and lowering the center of gravity two columns of semi submersible type are connected to the buoy with bearing on the top through a rigid yoke structure the buoy is moored by tension leg mooring then semi submersible type floater can rotate around the buoy the distance from the column housing the wind turbine to the buoy is 512 3 mm table 3 shows the principal particular of semi submersible floater the scaled model weighs about 1 7 kg which corresponds to about 13 600 tons in real scale 3 numerical simulation in this section numerical simulation methodology is explained the simulation considers the 3 dof motions in the horizontal plane the spm fowt system is considered as a combination of two rigid bodies of a fowt with a connecting bar and a mooring buoy the two rigid bodies are assumed to be connected by a bearing with friction also this simulation considers wind current and mooring as external forces 3 1 equation of motion the equation of motion is introduced as two rigid bodies fowt with a connecting bar and a mooring buoy fig 4 shows the coordinate systems of this model the mooring buoy is expressed in an absolute coordinate system in an inertial frame as in fig 4 a fowt is attached to the center of mooring buoy and the yawing motion of the fowt is considered in a non inertial frame as shown in fig 4 b in fig 4 a g b x b y b is the buoy center and ψ b is the yaw angle of the mooring buoy in fig 4 b g t is the center of gravity of the fowt with connecting bar and ψ t is the yaw angle of fowt the mooring buoy motion of equation in surge sway and yaw directions can be written as 1 m b d 2 x b d t 2 t x f b c x f t b r cos ψ t f t b ψ sin ψ t 2 m b d 2 y b d t 2 t y f b c y f t b r sin ψ t f t b ψ cos ψ t 3 i b d 2 ψ b d t 2 t m m t b where m b and i b are the mass and the moment of inertia of the mooring buoy t x t y are the forces in the x and y directions and t m is the yaw moment acting on the buoy due to mooring f b c x and f b c y are the forces in the x and y directions acting on the buoy due to current f t b r and f t b ψ are respectively the axial and tangential internal force between the mooring buoy and the fowt m t b is the moment caused due to friction of the bearing on the mooring buoy the equation of motion for the fowt with connecting bar in axial force equilibrium and tangential moment equilibrium directions can be written as 4 f t w r f t c r f t b r m t d 2 x b d t 2 cos ψ t m t d 2 y b d t 2 sin ψ t 0 5 i t i t a d 2 ψ t d t 2 b d ψ t d t f t w ψ l 2 f t c ψ l 3 m w m t b m t d 2 x b d t 2 l 1 sin ψ t m t d 2 y b d t 2 l 1 cos ψ t where m t is the mass of the fowt with connecting bar i t and i t a are the moment of inertia and additional moment of inertia of the fowt with connecting bar b is the slow drift damping coefficient of the fowt f t w r f t w ψ are the forces in the axial and tangential directions and m w is the yaw moment acting on the fowt due to wind f t c r and f t c ψ are axial and tangential current force acting on the sub structure body part below the free water surface of the fowt l 1 is the distance between g b and g t l 2 is the distance between g b and the point of action of wind force l 3 is the distance between g b and the point of action of current force it can be seen that the coordinate system of the floating body is in non inertial frame and moves with the mooring buoy in other words when the mooring buoy moves with acceleration inertial force is applied to the floating wind turbine therefore the inertial force of mooring buoy is taken into consideration in this equation of motion the fourth and fifth terms on the left side of eq 4 and the fifth and sixth terms on the right side of eq 5 are the inertial terms associated with the acceleration motion of the mooring buoy 3 2 modeling of wind force the wind load on the wind turbine varies by the angle of attack of the wind in this study the wind load measured by a dynamometer is applied to the simulation the wind loads f t w r n f t w ψ n and m z n m see fig 5 at wind speed of 2 2 m s are measured for different inflow angles with change interval of 15 figs 6 and 7 show the measured wind thrust loads and moment respectively the point between measurement points is interpolated by spline where c d w is drag coefficient ρ a kg m3 is air density v w is wind speed of 2 2 m s a w m2 is projected area of wind turbine assuming that c d w ρ a and a w are constant wind load f w at relative wind speed v w is given as 7 f w f w v w 2 v w 2 the yaw moment m z on the wind turbine is also given as follows 8 m z m z v w 2 v w 2 the relative wind speed v w and inflow relative angle θ w considering the movement of mooring buoy and fowt is given as follows 9 v w v w r v w ψ v w 0 cos φ w ψ t u cos ψ t v sin ψ t v w 0 sin φ w ψ t u sin ψ t v cos ψ t r t l 2 10 θ w tan 1 v w ψ v w r where v w 0 is absolute wind speed u v are the linear velocities in x and y directions of the mooring buoy as defined in fig 4 a and r t is the angular velocity of the fowt as defined in fig 4 b therefore wind force is given as 11 f t w r f w sin θ w f t w ψ f w cos θ w 3 3 modeling of current force in this study current force is assumed as follows 12 f c 1 2 c d ρ w v c 2 a c where c d is drag coefficient ρ w kg m3 is water density v c is relative current speed a c m2 is projected area under the water the relative current speed v c and inflow relative angle θ c considering the movement of buoy and fowt is given as follows 13 v c v c r v c ψ v c 0 cos φ c ψ t u cos ψ t v sin ψ t v c 0 sin φ c ψ t u sin ψ t v cos ψ t r t l 3 14 θ c tan 1 v c ψ v c r 15 f t c r f c sin θ c f t c ψ f c cos θ c 3 4 modeling of mooring force in the experiment the buoy is moored by four cables and anchor the mooring force acted by i th mooring t i n is assumed as 16 t i k δ where k n m is the mooring coefficient and δ is displacement of i th mooring point of the buoy when the i th mooring point moves from initial mooring position x i y i to the position x i y i x i y i is given as 17 x i y i cos ψ b sin ψ b sin ψ b cos ψ b x i y i x b y b therefore the angle α i the mooring force t x i and t y i the moment t m i is given as follows 18 α i tan 1 y i y i x i x i 19 t x i t i cos α i t y i t i sin α i 20 t m i t i l i sin α i ψ b where l i is the distance between center of buoy and i th mooring point t x t y and t m can be calculated as the sum of the four moorings 21 t x y i 1 4 t x i y i t m i 1 4 t m i 3 5 modeling of bearing in the experiment a bearing is used as the rotation mechanism between the mooring buoy and fowt with connecting bar when the tangential internal force f t b ψ acts the friction moment of the bearing m t b is generated 22 m t b μ p d 2 where μ is the coefficient of friction d m is the nominal bearing inner diameter p is the resultant load acting on the bearing estimated as per eq 23 23 p f t b r 2 f t b ψ 2 when the axial internal force f t b r acts on the fowt the axial force of the same magnitude is generated as an internal force on the buoy when the yaw moment of the wind turbine m z act the tangential force f t b ψ is generated as an internal force 24 f t b ψ m z l 2 4 circulating water tank test 4 1 circulating water tank in this section the outline of the water tank tests using the 1 200 scaled model in wind and current coexisting field are explained a circulating water tank and a wind blower is set to generate current and wind figs 8 and 9 show the circulating water tank and wind blower used in the experiment the length breadth and depth of circulating water tank is respectively 4 5 1 5 and 1 0 m the circulating water channel is driven by a 4 bladed axial flow impeller and can achieve a working maximum velocity of 2 3 m s the wind blower consists of six fans and a control panel 4 2 experimental conditions of the forced oscillation yaw test in this study two tests i fluid resistance test and ii forced oscillation yaw test are carried out firstly in still water and then in current condition the purpose of these tests is to determine the loads on the floating model i e to obtain the added moment of inertia and damping coefficients and clarify the water load on the floating body a 1 200 scale floating model is used for experiments fig 10 shows the coordinate system of the test and the definitions of f x f y and m z measured when the floating model is subjected to forced yawing motion two kinds of fluid resistance test one by changing the yaw angle of the floating body and another by varying the current flow are conducted in the first test the current flow of 0 12 m s is kept constant and floating model angle ψ is changed by an interval of 15 further varying current flow test was performed with constant yaw angle of ψ 180 and flow rate of current is varied from 0 036 m s to 0 39 m s yaw angle for forced oscillation test in still water and in tidal current ψ was given by the following equation 25 ψ a sin 2 π t t b a sin ω t b where a rad is the amplitude of the yaw oscillation t s is the time period t s is the elapsed time b rad is the center of yawing and ω s is the angular frequency table 4 shows the conditions of the forced oscillation yaw test performed on the semi submersible type floating body and the spar type floating body 4 3 weathervaning experiment the experiment is conducted by changing the current speed and initial yaw angle wind and current are setup opposite to each other during experiment table 5 shows the conditions of the experiments the wind speed is fixed at 2 2 m s and it corresponds to the rated thrust value in real scale based on the froude scaling law this wind speed is obtained based on the experimental result of the scaled wind turbine model current speed of 3 69 cm s correspond to 1 0 knot in real scale fig 11 shows the initial yaw angle of fowts after the scale model is placed at each initial yaw angle wind and current are turned on and the weathervane performance is observed yaw angle of 180 is the final point where the downwind type fowt stabilize following the wind the measuring items used in the experiment are motion capture camera and tracker fig 12 shows the a motion capture camera and b tracker by irradiating light and measuring the reflection light from tracker with two cameras the 6 dof data can be obtained therefore it is possible to obtain time series data of motion 4 4 conditions of the numerical simulation table 6 shows the conditions of the numerical simulation runge kutta gill method is adopted in the simulation as the time history calculation method and the time step is 0 05 sec 5 experimental and simulation result 5 1 fluid resistance test the results of fluid resistance test when the flow velocity is changed with the yaw angle of floating body ψ set to 180 are shown in fig 13 for both semi submersible and spar type models the drag coefficient of the floating model is plotted with the varying current flow it can be seen that the drag coefficient of the semi submersible type and spar type floating bodies are almost constant about 1 15 and 1 05 respectively next fig 14 shows the change of the drag coefficient of the semi submersible type floating body when the yaw angle is changed since the shape of the spar type floating body is point symmetric the drag coefficient is assumed to be constant at all yaw angles and this test was not performed from fig 14 we can observe that the drag coefficient changes significantly when the yaw angle changes this is thought to be due to the shape of the lower hull below the water surface for the semi submersible type floating body at various yaw angle positions 5 2 forced oscillation yaw test still water condition hashimoto et al 2019 discussed the analysis methodology to obtain added moment of inertia and damping coefficient from the forced oscillation yaw test in this paper similar methodology is used and analysis of the water load in the forced oscillation yaw test is carried out the analysis technique is briefly shown here for the case of semi submersible type floating body the experiment condition is time period of 10 s and the amplitude of yaw oscillation 80 deg as an example the equation of motion in the yaw direction when the floating body oscillates can be expressed as follows 26 i i a ψ b ψ f y l c ψ m z where i kg m2 is the moment of inertia of the floating body i a kg m2 is the added moment of inertia b kg m2 s is the slow drift damping force coefficient and f y n is the drag force in y direction which is proportional to the square of the flow velocity the directional component l m is the distance from the center of rotation to the point of impact of the drag force and c kg m2 s2 is the restoring coefficient the left hand side of equation 26 is summarized as the inertia damping drag and restoring terms however in this study c is zero because only the motion in the yaw direction is considered also in still water the velocity v a m s of the fluid acting on the floating body is 27 v a l ψ the drag force f y on the floating body is expressed by the following equation using the water density ρ kg m3 and the wetted projected area of the floater s m2 28 f y 1 2 ρ s c d v a v a by subtracting this drag term obtained by the above calculation from the experiment result it becomes an equation consisting of only the inertia and the damping force terms equation 26 can be expressed as follows 29 i i a a ω 2 sin ω t b a ω cos ω t m z where m z is the resultant moment obtained by subtracting the yaw moment due to drag force from measured m z for convenience the obtained m z is converted into a periodic function by dft discrete fourier transform as shown in fig 15 and can be expressed as shown in equation 30 30 m z m sin ω t ε from equations 29 and 30 the added moment of inertia i a and damping force coefficient b can be obtained by the following equations 31 i a m a ω 2 cos ε i 32 b m a ω sin ε fig 16 shows the comparison of m z calculated using the obtained added moment of inertia and damping force coefficient with the measured m z during experiment and it is clear that they agree well therefore it can be said that the added moment of inertia and damping force coefficient can be obtained by the above analysis method using the above method we obtained the added moment of inertia and damping coefficients of semi submersible and spar type floating bodies from forced yawing test results table 7 summarizes the coefficients used to obtain them it is noted here that c d 1 36 is used for the semi submersible type floating body corresponding to yaw angle of 90 see fig 14 the calculated added moment of inertia of the semi submersible type and the spar type are shown in figs 17 and 18 respectively from fig 17 it can be seen that the added moment of inertia of the semi submersible type floating body is a constant value of about 0 2 0 24 kg m2 in addition fig 18 shows that the added moment of inertia of the spar type floating body fluctuates slightly but is in the range of approximately 0 004 0 006 kg m2 in both cases the sum of the moment of inertia and the added moment of inertia is almost constant and it can be assumed that the value of the added moment of inertia is constant next figs 19 22 show the damping force coefficient of the semi submersible type and the spar type floating bodies for varying amplitudes and angular frequencies tested damping coefficient variation with the angular frequency figs 20 and 22 is shown for turning amplitude of 90 figs 19 and 20 show that the damping force coefficient of the semi submersible type floating body is proportional to the amplitude and angular frequency figs 21 and 22 show that the damping force coefficient of the spar type floating body is proportional to the angular frequency but not to the amplitude an approximate expression was derived using the obtained damping force coefficient determined by the amplitude and angular frequency and the value was used in the numerical simulation 5 3 forced oscillation yaw test current condition the method of analysing the water load in the current condition is explained below fig 23 shows the coordinate system of the floating body in current therefore the relative flow velocity v a and the inflow angle ϕ ca are 35 v a v a x 2 v a y 2 36 φ c a tan 1 v a y v a x then the drag force received by the floating body due to current is as follows 37 f c 1 2 ρ v a 2 s c d therefore the hydrodynamic load f y in the y direction is as follows 38 f y f c sin φ c a using the drag term obtained from above the added moment of inertia and the damping force coefficient obtained in the forced oscillation yaw test in still water the load due to water was calculated fig 24 shows the comparison between experimental and calculated values of m z in the current condition from fig 24 the water load can be reproduced even in the current condition and it can be said that the damping force coefficient is not greatly affected by current 5 4 only wind condition results figs 25 and 26 show the experimental and simulation result of the semi submersible type and the spar type the fowt start rotating around the mooring buoy at initial angle of 0 and aligns itself with the wind direction to final position at around 180 the green line shows the calculation result without damping force and red line shows the calculation result with damping force it is noted that the damping force here is due to the slow drift motion of the fowt about the single point mooring and therefore the numerical simulation with damping investigates the effect of slow drift damping condition both of the models can follow the wind direction finely and it can be said that the models attain stability comparing the experimental results of semi submersible and spar it can be seen that semi submersible model aligns with the wind direction around 25 s fig 25 black line and spar model aligns with the wind direction around 8 s fig 26 black line it can be concluded that the spar model follows the wind faster than semi submersible model in the case of semi submersible model simulation with damping red line aligns with the wind direction around 23 s and seen to be closer to experimental result black line the path of aligning with wind direction from 0 to 23 s is predicted well by simulation with damping force when compared with the experiment result simulation without damping green line is found to have slow oscillation motion about the final position 180 and aligns completely with wind around 45 s of the simulation also if we consider the overshoot angle it is about 190 and 183 for the simulation result without and with damping respectively in the case of spar model from fig 26 the overshoot angle of about 200 and 185 can be observed for simulation without and with damping force respectively from these discussions it can be said that the simulation with damping force shows better result than the simulation without damping it can also be seen that simulation result with damping force can predict the experiment result well therefore the damping force affects the yaw motion of the fowt and to predict the yawing of the fowt accurately the slow drift damping force needs to be considered however in both of the simulation fowt follow the wind direction a little faster than the experiment this can be because the damping force becomes larger due to the wave generated by the wind or the model of the friction force may not express the real phenomena well 5 5 wind current coexisting condition results in this section wind current coexisting condition is considered figs 27 and 28 show the experimental and simulation results of spar type and semi submersible type in the wind current coexisting condition current speed is 3 69 cm s the green line shows the calculation result without damping force and red line shows the calculation result with damping force it can be observed that both of the models can follow the wind direction well in wind current condition semi submersible and spar models align with the wind direction around 40 s and 10 s respectively comparing the simulation results with and without damping force the simulation result with damping force shows better result than the result without damping even in current condition the path of fowt which is aligning with the wind direction can be predicted well using simulation with damping especially the simulation result with damping fig 28 red line of spar model matches finely when compared with the experiment result fig 28 black line 6 conclusion in this study weathervane performance of two types of fowts moored by spm system in the wind current coexisting field is understood by scaled model experiments and numerical simulation the experiment is conducted using 1 200 scaled models of spar and semi submersible type based on froude s scaling law and the numerical simulation program is developed assuming the spm fowts modelled as two rigid bodies the influence of slow drift damping on weathervaning is confirmed by comparing the simulation results with and without using damping coefficients following specific conclusions can be derived it is found from fluid resistance test that the drag coefficient of semi submersible type floating body changes significantly depending on the yaw angle position of the floater this is due to the shape of the lower hull below the water surface for the semi submersible type floating body at various yaw angle positions and this is an important parameter to understand weathervane phenomenon the water load due to the weathervane is evaluated from forced oscillation yaw test both in still water and current conditions an example case of the methodology is shown for the semi submersible model and is validated by comparing the experiment and calculation results it is also confirmed that the water load can be reproduced even in current condition added moment of inertia and damping force coefficient of spar and semi submersible floating bodies is estimated for varying amplitudes and angular frequencies in forced oscillation test it is found that the added moment of inertia is approximately constant for both the models with regards to the damping force coefficient both the models behave differently the damping force coefficient of the semi submersible floater is proportional to both amplitude and angular frequency whereas the damping force coefficient of the spar floater is proportional only to the angular frequency of oscillation but not to the amplitude it is found from the result of the experiment and simulation the fowts follows the wind direction and performs weathervane both in only wind and wind current conditions simulation result with damping force can predict the weathervane phenomenon accurately than the simulation result without damping for both spar and semi submersible models therefore it can be concluded that slow drift damping force evaluation is necessary for understanding the weathervane phenomenon of spm fowts credit authorship

21391,autonomous marine systems may switch between various operational modes with different levels of autonomy loa due to a rapidly changing environment and the complex nature of tasks the dynamic autonomy brings an additional layer of complexity to ensuring safe marine operations but this functionality is not sufficiently considered in current risk analysis methods hence this paper proposes an

technological developments in software and hardware have led to a rapid increase in autonomous functionality in several systems and applications examples include transportations systems such as autonomous cars ships and trains and systems for research in harsh remote environments for reducing human exposure fan et al 2020 ramos et al 2019a a desired outcome of autonomy is the development of systems that operate in a more cost effective and safe manner autonomy means that the system has the ability of integrated sensing perceiving analysing communicating planning decision making and acting to achieve the goals assigned by human operators through designed human machine interface utne et al 2017a autonomous systems may have different levels of autonomy loa and there are different classifications of loas in this paper we adopt the definition from ludvigsen and sørensen 2016 and utne et al 2017b which classifies autonomous operations into four levels i automatic operation remote operation ii management by consent iii semi autonomous or management by exception and iv highly autonomous autonomous marine systems may switch between various operational modes with different loa due to rapidly changing environment or complex nature of tasks this means that the operation for example may start in a lower level of autonomy e g remote control mode by a human operator evolves into a higher level of autonomy e g semi autonomous mode with the operator then acting as a supervisor and later return to a lower level again in a subsequent moment due to operational requirements and changing external conditions for instance dynamic loa is expected for underwater vehicles ludvigsen and sørensen 2016 schjølberg and utne 2015 sørensen and ludvigsen 2015 and autonomous ships ramos et al 2019b wu et al 2020 the changes in loa resulted from switching between operational modes may take place in a very short period of time e g minutes and under severe sea conditions the development process of autonomous marine systems must consider the risks involved in its operation to ensure safety for humans minimal negative impact on the environment and asset integrity utne et al 2017b for autonomous ships expected to come into operation within a few years the efforts have been on identifying high level hazards originating from both design and operation burmeister et al 2014 heikkilä et al 2017 rødseth and burmeister 2015 wróbel et al 2016 for underwater vehicles risk and reliabilities analyses have so far primarily focused on technical failures harris et al 2016 hinz et al 2010 thieme et al 2015 xiang et al 2017 xinqian et al 2009 xu et al 2013 in addition to human failures to a limited extent ho et al 2011 thieme and utne 2017 yet dynamic autonomy brings an additional layer of complexity to the systems and operations especially regarding the interactions among human operators software hardware interaction associated hazards may lead to accidents if not well recognized and controlled still no risk analysis method has thus far considered how dynamic autonomy as a functionality can be handled in the hazard identification process the objective of this paper is to bridge this gap by proposing an approach to identifying hazards and safety requirements for safe operational mode transitions traditional hazard identification methods such as hazard identification hazid checklists and accident investigation reports are often a basis for identifying what can go wrong which is the first step in risk analysis rausand 2011 the systems theoretic process analysis stpa is a relatively new hazard analysis technique based on the causality model called the systems theoretic accident model and processes stamp leveson 2011 it defines safety as a control problem which makes it desirable for complex systems the stpa has been applied to identify and analyse hazards in several different domains including autonomous ships valdez banda et al 2019 wróbel et al 2018b and dynamic positioning dp systems on maritime vessels rokseth et al 2017 2018 yet to this moment system dependencies resulting from shifts in loa has not been addressed this paper proposes an approach that uses the stpa as a foundation and further expands it for autonomous functionality with a particular focus on dynamic loa resulted from mode shifting in operation the proposed approach can contribute to the safe design of autonomous marine systems such as underwater vehicles the paper is structured as follows the approach is described in section 2 in section 3 the application of the approach is illustrated with a case study for the net inspection with a remotely operated vehicle rov of a fish cage in aquaculture which is followed by a discussion of the results in section 4 section 5 concludes the work 2 methodology in stpa there are three basic constructs 1 safety constraints 2 hierarchical control structures and 3 process models the safety constraints specify system conditions or behaviours that need to be satisfied to prevent hazards leveson and thomas 2018 the safety constraints should be reinforced through the behaviour of the system by an effective control system the hierarchical control structure is a system model that is composed of feedback control loops leveson and thomas 2018 the process model represents internal beliefs of the controller s concerning the process being controlled as well as other relevant aspects of the system or the environment the process model thus reflects how the controller s perceive the system variables and their current states the relationship between the variables and the way the process can change the states stpa analysis aims to determine how the safety constraints can be violated or insufficiently enforced to eliminate mitigate and control the emergence of hazards that may develop into accidents for a system that has operational modes with different loas smooth and safe transitions are critical for successful commission in other words operators must be able to take over control when needed one merit of stpa is that it investigates dysfunctional controller interactions as a cause for flawed process execution a regular stpa however does not provide explicit guidance to analysis of possible failures during operational transitions and associated shifts between different loa these failures are the focus of the proposed approach as shown in fig 1 a color coding is used in the figure where there are standard procedures are marked as gray and added procedures are marked white a detailed description of its phases and steps is provided in the following 2 1 phase 1 define the purpose of the analysis in a standard stpa the first part of the analysis comprises step 1 1 identify losses i e something of value to stakeholders step 1 2 identify system level hazards and to identify system level safety constraints the following additional steps are proposed to be integrated into phase 1 to aid in establishing control structures considering different responsibilities and process models i e human operator and system controller s internal beliefs used to make decisions step 1 3 identify operational modes and corresponding loas the human machine interactions and cooperation are expressed by various loas with each level specify a different degree to which an operation is in between fully manual performance and fully autonomous conditions vagia et al 2016 the definition of loa are subject to applications and should be selected to satisfy the system s own needs in this paper we use the following four loas defined by ludvigsen and sørensen 2016 and utne et al 2017b for marine systems 1 loa 1 automatic operation remote control the human operator directs and controls all high level mission planning the environmental conditions and sensor data are presented to the operator through a human machine interface hmi 2 loa 2 management by consent the system automatically makes recommendations for missions or actions related to specific functions the system can perform some tasks independently of human control when previously delegated by the human 3 loa 3 semi autonomous operation management by exception the system automatically executes mission related functions the human may override or change parameters and cancel or redirect actions with defined timelines the operator s attention is only brought to exceptions for certain decisions 4 highly autonomous operation the system automatically executes missions or process related functions in an unstructured environment with the ability to plan and replan the mission the system is independent and intelligent in this paper an operational mode refers to a functional configuration of a system inside an operational mode the system can perform specific operational scenarios and so activate the corresponding functions faisandier 2013 the loa is fixed or consistent for each operational mode for various operational modes integrated into one marine system the loas can vary across a continuum of intermediate levels between manual operation and fully autonomous step 1 4 describe tasks involving different operational modes this step should focus on how an operation may be performed from the beginning to the end the description does not need to be comprehensive but to include how the controllers i e both human operator and system controller may adapt operational modes to foreseen various circumstance the aim is to have an initial illustration of how dynamic the operation can be 2 2 phase 2 model the control structures the standard stpa is functionality oriented for each function one control structure rather than a physical component diagram can be prepared at a high level and zoomed in with more details if necessary the control structure is a system model that is composed of feedback control loops leveson and thomas 2018 the first three standard steps in this phase include modeling control structure assign ing responsibilities including process models and deriving feedback a repetition loop is added to analyse all the operational modes in the same manner the control structures can help designers to understand the dynamic controller interactions associated with the shifting of loas to perceive comprehend project and decide to complete the mission 2 3 phase 3 identify unsafe control actions stpa defines an unsafe control action uca as a control action that in a particular context and worst case environment will lead to a hazard leveson and thomas 2018 the standard stpa procedure prescribes identifying ucas for each operational mode step 3 1 in fig 1 in addition to the ucas we define unsafe transition control actions utca those can be identified through the following three additional steps step 3 2 identify operational modes transitions a state transition diagram std is used to analyse possible transitions between operational modes std was originally proposed by david harel 1987 and is commonly applied in computer science to provide an abstract description of system behaviours the main idea of applying std is to demonstrate the possible transition among various operational modes with different loa each transition can be investigated while analysing unsafe control action from either operator or autonomous system s controller or both the std is an intuitive method and perceived well represents the states of the system after shifts between finite operational modes fig 2 presents a simplified std for possible transitions between two operational modes states the nodes denote the modes states and the arrows denote transitions the transition happens when triggering events occur in state a and guard conditions are satisfied harel 1987 step 3 3 identify triggering events in general the triggering events can be internal stimuli or external stimuli internal stimuli are events that occur within the autonomous system while external stimuli are events in the surrounding operational environment the external and internal stimuli can be described in connection with the following four types of triggering events as adapted from friedenthal et al 2014 a change event that happens when some condition has been satisfied a timeout event that initiates after the specified amount of time elapses a call event that indicates an operation has been requested by e g a human operator and a completion event that takes place when everything that needs to be done in the current mode is completed examples of triggering events under each category are further described in detail in the case study section 3 3 step 3 4 identify unsafe transition control actions utcas a transition control action is an action that is either provided by a human operator or the autonomous system s controller upon transitions between modes there are four ways a control action can be unsafe leveson 2011 which also apply to unsafe transition control actions not providing transition control action providing a transition control action e g provides a wrong transition providing a transition control action too early too late or out of order the transition control action lasts too long or is stopped too soon the unsafe transition control actions are defined based on the transition diagram triggering events responsibilities and process models of the controllers 2 4 phase 4 identify loss scenarios once the unsafe transition control actions are identified the next step is to identify loss scenarios and refine safety constraints if necessary two types of loss scenarios should be considered 1 the scenarios that lead to a utca and 2 scenarios in which the transitions are improperly executed or not executed the first type may involve failures related to the controller an inadequate control algorithm an unsafe control input and an insufficient process model leveson 2011 the scenarios concerning an improper or no execution of a transition type 2 involve a control path which transfers transition control action to the controlled process these scenarios might include i a transition control action not executed ii a transition control action improperly executed and iii the controlled process does not respond or responds incorrectly though transition control actions received leveson and thomas 2018 3 case study a case study has been performed to test the feasibility of the proposed approach the case study focuses on preventing fish escape from fish cages for aquaculture in rov operations fish escape in aquaculture has severe environmental effects and the authorities continuously put much effort to avoid escapes and mitigate the impact of escapes holen et al 2019 norwegian ministry of trade industry and fisheries 2017 according to the statistics for fish escape from 2010 to 2016 in sea based aquaculture operations most fish escapes 72 are due to holes in the net føre and thorvaldsen 2017 the mandatory net inspection after aquaculture operations is one of the primary measures to reduce the risk of fish escape yang et al 2020 the aim is to discover the holes caused by operations and to initiate necessary recovery actions as early as possible rovs are prevalent in aquaculture operations such as net inspections but also generally to increase operation regularity reduce exposure of the workers to the harsh environment and increase the weather window for operations e g delousing net cleaning rovs have tethers that limit their manoeuvrability and increase the risk of entanglement nevertheless they have a transparent and shared control process i e the human controller shares control with an autonomous controller which increases their potential for use in specific applications and environments for instance the shared control provides advantages when handling flexible structures demanding environments with currents and large waves and changing geometry in an undetermined pattern the potential losses for such operations are primarily the loss of life due to human overboard the loss of fish and damage to property the rovs currently adopted in the industry mainly have low loa i e they are remote controlled by an operator rov operation could benefit from more autonomous functionalities to increase inspection quality and effectiveness and reduce operator fatigue bjelland et al 2015 industrial sperre rov technology 2017 and research schjølberg and utne 2015 sintef ocean 2016 efforts have been focusing on developing higher level autonomous rov systems christ and wernli 2014 the proposed approach is applied to an observation class rov provided by a vendor with extensive offshore rov operating experience in the oil and gas industry it engages in developing autonomous functionalities for aquaculture operations the rov is used for net inspection inside the fish cage fig 3 the steps described in the previous section are applied to this operation in the following 3 1 phase 1 define the purpose of the analysis step 1 1 identify losses the main concerning loss in rov net inspection in this case study is the loss of fish which will result in loss of profits loss of reputation and biological degradation of the wild fish stocks step 1 2 identify system level hazards and constraints we primarily focus on the loss of fish due to i failures of the rov to detect existing holes in the net and ii damage to the net caused by the rov itself during operation the scope of the analysis is limited to two system levels hazards h 1 rov is unable to successfully complete the inspection incl holes not detected h 2 rov collides with net structure or tangles with the net additional system level hazards such as the rov leak of hydraulic oil the high voltage electrical hazard frame integrity lost and water leakage into rovs are not considered in this case study table 1 describes the safety constraints that the system conditions or behaviours need to satisfy to prevent hazards and ultimately prevent losses the rov system comprises the rov the handling system the surface control system and all associated equipment the following four rov operational modes are considered in this case study manual control mode mcm station keeping mode skm and relative station keeping mode rskm and net pen tracking mode ntm the rov should be capable of operating in multiple levels of autonomy to ensure operational performance manual control mode loa 1 in this mode the rov operator has direct control of each thruster via operation control e g joysticks or control console the rov operator has visual feedback on display from cameras and data from sensors e g depth sensor compass to steer the rov by sending control forces to the thrusters the steering also includes a heading and depth control system that automatically keeps a given reference heading and depth provided by the operator the raw data from the sensors are filtered to remove noises such as inputs to the control system the desired rpm revolutions per minute is allocated to each thruster accordingly from both the operator s and controller s input the operator is provided with a rough heading and depth indication and the visual feedback to control the rov the control of the position and heading of the rov to compensate for rov dynamics and environmental disturbances i e wind waves and current demands considerable effort from the operator moreover preventing entanglement is dependent on the skill and experience of the rov operator the manual control mode is representative of loa 1 station keeping mode and relative station keeping mode loa 2 the rov is equipped with a dynamic positioning dp system to keep the position and orientation within certain excursion limits sørensen 2012 for the rov to hold its position and move along with the net it depends on data fusion between various navigation sensors the motion control system compensates for environmental disturbance and rov dynamics the navigation system is responsible for estimating the position velocity heading depth and altitude of an rov in a given reference system the navigation sensors need to make the system observable and controllable chen 1998 which may contain a compass a pressure gauge and an ultrashort short or long baseline network consisting of acoustic positioning systems apss doppler velocity log dvl gyroscopes and accelerometers dukan 2014 the rov senses any variation from the desired position determines what thrust vector is required and sends instructions to maintain the position and orientation in this operational mode the rov operator has the authority to take over control and control the thrusters directly in this case the operation switches modes from loa2 to loa1 relative station keeping is similar to station keeping but instead of maintaining a constant position and heading the rov will maintain a constant distance and relative heading to the net the initiation of relative station keeping requires the rov to be close and pointing towards the net pen net pen tracking mode loa 3 the net pen tracking is a desired semi autonomous operation functionality loa 3 within aquaculture currently under research duda et al 2015 rundtop and frank 2016 in this mode the rov follows the shape of the net to perform the inspection autonomously nonetheless obtaining the relative position of the net pen is challenging as the net pen deforms by current induced drag forces which makes it an undetermined shape lader et al 2008 for instance a current velocity of 0 5 m s may lead to a 20 volume reduction in an exposed net pen lader et al 2008 in this mode dvl may function as a net relative sensor to provide net pen relative velocities range and heading when the rov is directed towards the net pen the desired velocities of the rov can then be generated as the rov moves along the varying net pen using the relative net pen measurements the guidance system of the rov produces the desired reference velocity aiming to keep the rov with a fixed net pen relative range and heading and keeping a plan for traversing the whole net pen using the navigation system and the dynamics of the rov note that the guidance system does not require prior knowledge of the whole net pen in the net pen tracking mode the rov operator is a supervisor having the authority to intervene in case of an emergency or change of mission plan this can be achieved by overriding i e switch to station keeping mode or relative station keeping mode or directly control the thrusters using joysticks i e switch to manual control mode in this mode the operator provides a mission i e an inspection of the whole net cage with the rov containing specific safe navigation rules in the presence of moving or static obstacles as an input to path re planning a set of waypoints are established according to the mission plan the weather the operation among other factors a smooth feasible trajectory is generated so that the rov can follow the raw data from the sensors including images from the camera are processed into the navigation system to give the relative net pen position position measurement velocity and heading estimates based on relative net pen position and position measurement a map is generated during operation to enhance the operator s operation monitoring an example of such a representation of a fish cage is a 3d occupancy grid map hornung et al 2013 which is sent to the graphical user interface gui step 1 4 describe tasks involving different operational mode net inspection task to initiate the net inspection task the operator launches the rov into the fish cage the mission is to traverse and inspect the entire fish cage the rov is initially set to manual control mode and manually manoeuvred to the side of the net the operator configures the rov for the preferred relative distance and heading to the net as well as the desired velocity once the rov is in position the operator activates the net pen tracking mode the net inspection process is initiated and the rov operator supervises the operation and handles the rov tether in case a hole is detected by the rov the relative station keeping mode is automatically activated and an alarm is sent to the gui to bring rov operator s attention to the detected hole the hole is examined and logged and the rov operator reactivates the net pen tracking mode to continue the inspection if the rov is tangled in the ropes inside the cage the station keeping mode is activated and at the same time the rov operator is informed the operator turns the rov to manual mode to untangle itself if the rov is tangled in the net the rov operator is informed and the thrusters are automatically turned off a further investigation of the situation will then be needed to decide how to proceed when obstacles are detected on the planned path i e the produced desired trajectory safe navigation rules are applied and the rov operator is informed if the operator disagrees with the rule in certain situations the rov is switched to manual control mode and the operator takes over to manoeuvre it to a safe location and net pen tracking mode is reactivated fig 4 illustrates the main tasks performed during the net inspection and the operation modes involved 3 2 phase 2 model the control structures fig 5 summarizes results from steps 2 1 2 5 in phase 2 step 2 1 model control structure step 2 2 assign responsibilities step 2 3 derive feedbacks step 2 4 repeat for each operational mode step 2 5 identify differences among modes the control structures focus on two controllers the human operator and rov controller rov controllers need to collaborate to complete a mission by switching between operational modes at different loas upon different operational contexts the lists of responsibilities specify the tasks each agent needs to accomplish for the safety constrains to be enforced due to limited space fig 5 presents partial examples of assigned responsibilities at each operational mode for net inspection function and collision avoidance with their corresponding process models and feedback note that the relative station keeping is not demonstrated separately due to its similarity with the station keeping mode and net pen tracking mode the steps 2 1 2 5 are combined in one figure for the convenience of comparison among different operational modes 3 3 phase 3 identify unsafe control actions step 3 2 identify operational mode transitions the functional transitions between the four operational modes and shutdown mode are shown in fig 6 step 3 3 identify triggering events the triggering events for the rov operational mode transition can be divided into two categories external stimuli and internal stimuli as defined in section 2 3 the triggering events are summarized in fig 7 and exemplified in table 2 external stimuli when an rov is on a mission the human operator is an external stimulus who has the highest authority the operator can always activate a transition of operational mode following a call event e g a request from an rov operator another type of external stimulus is the change event which covers the detection of interest e g detect a hole in the net a change in environmental features and a detection of environmental objects the operational environment is critical to an rov operation and environmental interactions and consequent changes in environmental features should be anticipated however as pointed by dogramadzi et al 2014 the existing hazard identification methods do not encourage the safety analysis to consider different types of environmental interactions as an input to ensure safe robot operations changes in the environmental features are often associated with a change in sea conditions e g sea state a strong wind strong current and tides poor visibility due to fog or rain salinity the detection of environmental obstacles includes the detection of objects and agents obstacles are related to obstructions to vehicle movements such as fixed structures surface floating obstructions e g ships buoys anchor chains objects suspended in the water column e g fishing lines loose netting and bottom obstructions e g subsurface structures wrecks christ and wernli sr 2014 on the other hand agents are the objects purposefully moving in the environment four categories of agents are suggested to capture the full range of behavioural patterns that any agent may exhibit and need to be perceived by the robot dogramadzi et al 2014 they could be unintelligent automatic systems autonomous systems other robots animals and humans internal stimuli internal stimuli take place within the rov which can cover timeout events change events and completion events timeout events may fire the transition when other awaited events do not occur within the specified time interval the change events mainly originate from deviations of rov performance such as deviations in functional performance technical failures and software failures an additional triggering event or completion event could also automatically initiate the transition from working mode to shutdown mode the rov operator and rov controller share the control and generate control actions following their responsibilities and update their process models based on feedback table 3 presents the responsibilities and process models that would enable a successful transition by a collaboration between the rov operator and rov controller the process model is described by the status of process variables that would lead to a successful transition note that table 3 explicitly describes the operator s responsibility of supervising the mission in cases where the operator s attention must be directed to one aspect of the operation e g collision avoidance nonetheless in addition to the ones identified in table 3 the operator is responsible for the supervision of operations at all times and maintaining a situational awareness concerning the rov mission and surrounding variables table 4 presents the utcas for both the rov operator and rov controller for transition actions the utcas are identified by considering the contexts for transition responsibilities and process models described in table 3 3 4 phase 4 identify loss scenarios the next step is to identify scenarios and causal factors for each uca so that related safety constraints for safe transitions can be further detailed and refined in table 5 table 6 table 7 table 8 some causal scenarios causal factors and related safety constraints for selected ucas are presented 4 discussion 4 1 findings from the case study the rov used in the case study is a representative autonomous marine system that has frequent operational mode transitions due to complex operating contexts inside of a confined area i e inside of a fish cage the rov operator and rov controller must collaborate closely to avoid tether entanglement damage to the net structure as well as inspect report and temporarily block the holes if necessary in the net in time the dynamic autonomy brought by shifting between various operational modes that have different loas adds an additional layer of complexity to ensure safe operation however this functionality has not been well addressed in current hazard identification methods as commented on by hollnagel 2005 co agency specifically needs to be emphasized with a sound underlying model of the processes in this study we proposed an approach based on stpa and a simplified state transition diagram in which a more explicit model of operational mode transitions is provided the proposed method contributes to clearly communicating the shift of responsibilities by specifying i how the allocation of the responsibility between human operators and the rov controller changes under each operational mode ii what updated process model of the operator and the controller are to ensure a successful transition the proposed approach makes it more visible as to what changes occur in the system when the operating mode is changed the clarification of responsibilities under various situations can prepare the rov operator better during the operation for example in ntm the rov needs to make decisions by itself to switch to rskm or skm and bring the rov operator s attention to deal with the situation the rov operator is required to observe the deviations of functional performance and react promptly to take over i e switch to mcm or assist in switching mode when the rov entangles with the net and fails to turn off its thrusters the rov operator must detect the emergency as soon as possible and manually shut down the rov another example is the situation that the turbidity is too high that the camera optics are significantly degraded if the rov does not switch to skm automatically the operator should manually activate the skm in time before the rov goes too far in the detection the holes in the net might be missed the refined safety constraints based on the proposed approach also contribute to successfully completing a commission when there are dynamic control structures within one system some refined safety constraints from the case study especially emphasized the ensuring of safe transitions examples are as follows the proposed collision avoidance path must be displayed in gui to the rov operator the rov operator must be notified when the operational mode switches when the camera loses signals and does not respond to the rov operator for a certain amount of time the rov must be shut down and floated to the surface the rov operator should be informed when objects enter dangerous zones regardless of an evaluated no collision risk by the rov controller training must be provided to the rov operator to help become familiar with the capabilities of the system in various operational modes and another separate operator should be assigned for tether management the refined safety constraints are more concrete and can be input to improve system design and operational procedures when the higher level autonomy is integrated into the system the smooth transition faces the challenges of human action hazards such as skill degradation loss of engagement workload spikes a lack of predictability associated with autonomous systems and their overall complexity endsley 2019 the human action hazards in terms utcas for rov operators causal scenarios and the causal factors behind need to be well considered while refining safety constraints for example it is clear from the results that the object avoidance functionality is not available in the skm and rskm modes without knowing the limitation rov operator may come to select the rskm when an object is approaching on a collision course i e how ntm rskm uca operator 4 in table 8 may occur in the case study the proposed approach focuses on mode transitions and as such does not cover all aspects of the rov however the analysis can be extended using standard stpa to analyse each operational mode and identify corresponding unsafe control actions and scenarios when the rov is operated under such a mode to limit the scope of this study the above mentioned analysis is not included in the case study 4 2 limitations and possibilities of proposed approach for autonomous operations investigating hazard identification for autonomous marine systems and operations in general can rapidly transform into a considerable effort nonetheless it is a critical topic to be investigated the proposed approach offers possibilities of application beyond the rov case study presented in this paper for a large part of possible applications of autonomy autonomous systems with a loa as high as fully autonomous in which no human would be necessary or supervision tasks or remote control is not expected in the near future in this sense these systems also have shared control many of them may also have possibilities of changing loas during the operations an example is autonomous ships which are also expected to have dynamic loa for instance when unmooring out of a harbour with heavy traffic the ship can be controlled by operators working onshore remote control and change the loa to a higher level when reaching deep water with low traffic ramos et al 2019b moreover in case of a possible collision scenario the operator may take over control of the ship switching the loa back to the remote control indeed ramos et al 2020 states that the strong reliance on human system interaction shared control and dynamic loa present a challenge for risk assessments for autonomous ships the proposed approach allows for identifying triggering events for modes transition this is particularly relevant for analysis of marine systems which operate in a dynamic and complex environment the existing hazard identification methods do not consider different types of environmental interaction systematically and sufficiently dogramadzi et al 2014 the anticipation of possible environmental interactions is critical for a safe autonomous marine operation particularly when the systems are moving toward the direction of being fully autonomous the proposed method systematically identifies triggering events for transitions by dividing the events into external stimuli and internal stimuli events and further into change event timeout event call event and completion event the results can serve as a basis to define triggering events in the design phase for other types of autonomous marine systems such as autonomous ships as well it is worth noting that in some situations simultaneous triggering events can create decision dilemmas for example when the rov detects a suspected hole in the net the rov controller automatically switches to relative station keeping mode so that the hole can be logged and a further investigation can be carried out if at the same time an agent is detected moving towards the rov the collision avoidance function is expected to be activated automatically as well under such a context the best strategy might be to send a notification to the rov operator and let the operator take over control to avoid a collision and then move back to a location to log information on the hole if the hole is too big that fish start to escape as an emergency procedure the rov should temporarily block the hole to mitigate fish escape until a remedy is implemented e g send divers to repair in such an emergent situation the collision risk from moving the agent might be neglected the identification of such decision dilemmas and the definition of corresponding strategies are critical to a robust and safe design of autonomous systems the use of the proposed approach can shed light on identifying such dilemmas through defined external and internal stimuli events or conditions this issue is not within the scope of this study but will be researched in further work furthermore this study does not include the effects due to the interaction of external stimuli and internal stimuli e g a stronger current and control system crash broader scenarios considering the possible interactions should be established in the later stage of stpa the literature presents stpa as a valuable method for hazard identification of autonomous and remotely controlled ships operation wróbel et al 2018a b and the applicability to other autonomous marine systems needs to be tested in further work the different characteristics operating environment sensing motion and reaction capabilities may bring new insights into the method to this moment stpa applications have not explicitly explored the hazards arising from control modes transition the approach presented in this paper which needs to be validated for other autonomous systems can be an initial step towards the consideration of the important feature of control mode transition in stpa 5 conclusion this paper addresses the challenge of analysing the risk of autonomous marine systems focusing on the first step of risk analysis namely hazard identification autonomous systems may switch between different modes of operation and levels of autonomy which increases the complexity in particular with respect to interactions between the human operator supervisor software hardware and the environmental conditions these interactions impact risk but are challenging to identify and analyse this aspect has not been paid enough attention in risk and safety studies of autonomous marine systems the proposed approach in the paper uses stpa as a foundation but explicitly includes dynamic control hierarchies representing the different loa and focuses on identifying unsafe transition control actions scenarios and causal factors the proposed approach is exemplified for an rov but is expected to be relevant for other autonomous marine systems such as autonomous ships the results from the case study indicate that clarification of allocated responsibilities and updated process model of the operator and the controller are critical factors to ensure a safe operation the defined safety constraints as a result focus specially on how to ensure the responsibilities and updated process models to be communicated clearly among controllers the proposed classification of triggering events shed light on the systematic identification of possible environmental interactions to improve the design of autonomous marine systems further work includes applying and testing the proposed method in a wide selection of domains to further improve and develop a systematic approach to identify the triggering events and conditions for modes transition as input to eliminating hazards that

21391,autonomous marine systems may switch between various operational modes with different levels of autonomy loa due to a rapidly changing environment and the complex nature of tasks the dynamic autonomy brings an additional layer of complexity to ensuring safe marine operations but this functionality is not sufficiently considered in current risk analysis methods hence this paper proposes an approach to hazard identification based on the system theoretic process analysis stpa that includes unsafe transitions between different loa in systems a case study of a remotely operated vehicle rov with four operational modes with different loas is used to illustrate the approach the results show that the proposed approach contributes to 1 communicating a shift of responsibilities among human

technological developments in software and hardware have led to a rapid increase in autonomous functionality in several systems and applications examples include transportations systems such as autonomous cars ships and trains and systems for research in harsh remote environments for reducing human exposure fan et al 2020 ramos et al 2019a a desired outcome of autonomy is the development of systems that operate in a more cost effective and safe manner autonomy means that the system has the ability of integrated sensing perceiving analysing communicating planning decision making and acting to achieve the goals assigned by human operators through designed human machine interface utne et al 2017a autonomous systems may have different levels of autonomy loa and there are different classifications of loas in this paper we adopt the definition from ludvigsen and sørensen 2016 and utne et al 2017b which classifies autonomous operations into four levels i automatic operation remote operation ii management by consent iii semi autonomous or management by exception and iv highly autonomous autonomous marine systems may switch between various operational modes with different loa due to rapidly changing environment or complex nature of tasks this means that the operation for example may start in a lower level of autonomy e g remote control mode by a human operator evolves into a higher level of autonomy e g semi autonomous mode with the operator then acting as a supervisor and later return to a lower level again in a subsequent moment due to operational requirements and changing external conditions for instance dynamic loa is expected for underwater vehicles ludvigsen and sørensen 2016 schjølberg and utne 2015 sørensen and ludvigsen 2015 and autonomous ships ramos et al 2019b wu et al 2020 the changes in loa resulted from switching between operational modes may take place in a very short period of time e g minutes and under severe sea conditions the development process of autonomous marine systems must consider the risks involved in its operation to ensure safety for humans minimal negative impact on the environment and asset integrity utne et al 2017b for autonomous ships expected to come into operation within a few years the efforts have been on identifying high level hazards originating from both design and operation burmeister et al 2014 heikkilä et al 2017 rødseth and burmeister 2015 wróbel et al 2016 for underwater vehicles risk and reliabilities analyses have so far primarily focused on technical failures harris et al 2016 hinz et al 2010 thieme et al 2015 xiang et al 2017 xinqian et al 2009 xu et al 2013 in addition to human failures to a limited extent ho et al 2011 thieme and utne 2017 yet dynamic autonomy brings an additional layer of complexity to the systems and operations especially regarding the interactions among human operators software hardware interaction associated hazards may lead to accidents if not well recognized and controlled still no risk analysis method has thus far considered how dynamic autonomy as a functionality can be handled in the hazard identification process the objective of this paper is to bridge this gap by proposing an approach to identifying hazards and safety requirements for safe operational mode transitions traditional hazard identification methods such as hazard identification hazid checklists and accident investigation reports are often a basis for identifying what can go wrong which is the first step in risk analysis rausand 2011 the systems theoretic process analysis stpa is a relatively new hazard analysis technique based on the causality model called the systems theoretic accident model and processes stamp leveson 2011 it defines safety as a control problem which makes it desirable for complex systems the stpa has been applied to identify and analyse hazards in several different domains including autonomous ships valdez banda et al 2019 wróbel et al 2018b and dynamic positioning dp systems on maritime vessels rokseth et al 2017 2018 yet to this moment system dependencies resulting from shifts in loa has not been addressed this paper proposes an approach that uses the stpa as a foundation and further expands it for autonomous functionality with a particular focus on dynamic loa resulted from mode shifting in operation the proposed approach can contribute to the safe design of autonomous marine systems such as underwater vehicles the paper is structured as follows the approach is described in section 2 in section 3 the application of the approach is illustrated with a case study for the net inspection with a remotely operated vehicle rov of a fish cage in aquaculture which is followed by a discussion of the results in section 4 section 5 concludes the work 2 methodology in stpa there are three basic constructs 1 safety constraints 2 hierarchical control structures and 3 process models the safety constraints specify system conditions or behaviours that need to be satisfied to prevent hazards leveson and thomas 2018 the safety constraints should be reinforced through the behaviour of the system by an effective control system the hierarchical control structure is a system model that is composed of feedback control loops leveson and thomas 2018 the process model represents internal beliefs of the controller s concerning the process being controlled as well as other relevant aspects of the system or the environment the process model thus reflects how the controller s perceive the system variables and their current states the relationship between the variables and the way the process can change the states stpa analysis aims to determine how the safety constraints can be violated or insufficiently enforced to eliminate mitigate and control the emergence of hazards that may develop into accidents for a system that has operational modes with different loas smooth and safe transitions are critical for successful commission in other words operators must be able to take over control when needed one merit of stpa is that it investigates dysfunctional controller interactions as a cause for flawed process execution a regular stpa however does not provide explicit guidance to analysis of possible failures during operational transitions and associated shifts between different loa these failures are the focus of the proposed approach as shown in fig 1 a color coding is used in the figure where there are standard procedures are marked as gray and added procedures are marked white a detailed description of its phases and steps is provided in the following 2 1 phase 1 define the purpose of the analysis in a standard stpa the first part of the analysis comprises step 1 1 identify losses i e something of value to stakeholders step 1 2 identify system level hazards and to identify system level safety constraints the following additional steps are proposed to be integrated into phase 1 to aid in establishing control structures considering different responsibilities and process models i e human operator and system controller s internal beliefs used to make decisions step 1 3 identify operational modes and corresponding loas the human machine interactions and cooperation are expressed by various loas with each level specify a different degree to which an operation is in between fully manual performance and fully autonomous conditions vagia et al 2016 the definition of loa are subject to applications and should be selected to satisfy the system s own needs in this paper we use the following four loas defined by ludvigsen and sørensen 2016 and utne et al 2017b for marine systems 1 loa 1 automatic operation remote control the human operator directs and controls all high level mission planning the environmental conditions and sensor data are presented to the operator through a human machine interface hmi 2 loa 2 management by consent the system automatically makes recommendations for missions or actions related to specific functions the system can perform some tasks independently of human control when previously delegated by the human 3 loa 3 semi autonomous operation management by exception the system automatically executes mission related functions the human may override or change parameters and cancel or redirect actions with defined timelines the operator s attention is only brought to exceptions for certain decisions 4 highly autonomous operation the system automatically executes missions or process related functions in an unstructured environment with the ability to plan and replan the mission the system is independent and intelligent in this paper an operational mode refers to a functional configuration of a system inside an operational mode the system can perform specific operational scenarios and so activate the corresponding functions faisandier 2013 the loa is fixed or consistent for each operational mode for various operational modes integrated into one marine system the loas can vary across a continuum of intermediate levels between manual operation and fully autonomous step 1 4 describe tasks involving different operational modes this step should focus on how an operation may be performed from the beginning to the end the description does not need to be comprehensive but to include how the controllers i e both human operator and system controller may adapt operational modes to foreseen various circumstance the aim is to have an initial illustration of how dynamic the operation can be 2 2 phase 2 model the control structures the standard stpa is functionality oriented for each function one control structure rather than a physical component diagram can be prepared at a high level and zoomed in with more details if necessary the control structure is a system model that is composed of feedback control loops leveson and thomas 2018 the first three standard steps in this phase include modeling control structure assign ing responsibilities including process models and deriving feedback a repetition loop is added to analyse all the operational modes in the same manner the control structures can help designers to understand the dynamic controller interactions associated with the shifting of loas to perceive comprehend project and decide to complete the mission 2 3 phase 3 identify unsafe control actions stpa defines an unsafe control action uca as a control action that in a particular context and worst case environment will lead to a hazard leveson and thomas 2018 the standard stpa procedure prescribes identifying ucas for each operational mode step 3 1 in fig 1 in addition to the ucas we define unsafe transition control actions utca those can be identified through the following three additional steps step 3 2 identify operational modes transitions a state transition diagram std is used to analyse possible transitions between operational modes std was originally proposed by david harel 1987 and is commonly applied in computer science to provide an abstract description of system behaviours the main idea of applying std is to demonstrate the possible transition among various operational modes with different loa each transition can be investigated while analysing unsafe control action from either operator or autonomous system s controller or both the std is an intuitive method and perceived well represents the states of the system after shifts between finite operational modes fig 2 presents a simplified std for possible transitions between two operational modes states the nodes denote the modes states and the arrows denote transitions the transition happens when triggering events occur in state a and guard conditions are satisfied harel 1987 step 3 3 identify triggering events in general the triggering events can be internal stimuli or external stimuli internal stimuli are events that occur within the autonomous system while external stimuli are events in the surrounding operational environment the external and internal stimuli can be described in connection with the following four types of triggering events as adapted from friedenthal et al 2014 a change event that happens when some condition has been satisfied a timeout event that initiates after the specified amount of time elapses a call event that indicates an operation has been requested by e g a human operator and a completion event that takes place when everything that needs to be done in the current mode is completed examples of triggering events under each category are further described in detail in the case study section 3 3 step 3 4 identify unsafe transition control actions utcas a transition control action is an action that is either provided by a human operator or the autonomous system s controller upon transitions between modes there are four ways a control action can be unsafe leveson 2011 which also apply to unsafe transition control actions not providing transition control action providing a transition control action e g provides a wrong transition providing a transition control action too early too late or out of order the transition control action lasts too long or is stopped too soon the unsafe transition control actions are defined based on the transition diagram triggering events responsibilities and process models of the controllers 2 4 phase 4 identify loss scenarios once the unsafe transition control actions are identified the next step is to identify loss scenarios and refine safety constraints if necessary two types of loss scenarios should be considered 1 the scenarios that lead to a utca and 2 scenarios in which the transitions are improperly executed or not executed the first type may involve failures related to the controller an inadequate control algorithm an unsafe control input and an insufficient process model leveson 2011 the scenarios concerning an improper or no execution of a transition type 2 involve a control path which transfers transition control action to the controlled process these scenarios might include i a transition control action not executed ii a transition control action improperly executed and iii the controlled process does not respond or responds incorrectly though transition control actions received leveson and thomas 2018 3 case study a case study has been performed to test the feasibility of the proposed approach the case study focuses on preventing fish escape from fish cages for aquaculture in rov operations fish escape in aquaculture has severe environmental effects and the authorities continuously put much effort to avoid escapes and mitigate the impact of escapes holen et al 2019 norwegian ministry of trade industry and fisheries 2017 according to the statistics for fish escape from 2010 to 2016 in sea based aquaculture operations most fish escapes 72 are due to holes in the net føre and thorvaldsen 2017 the mandatory net inspection after aquaculture operations is one of the primary measures to reduce the risk of fish escape yang et al 2020 the aim is to discover the holes caused by operations and to initiate necessary recovery actions as early as possible rovs are prevalent in aquaculture operations such as net inspections but also generally to increase operation regularity reduce exposure of the workers to the harsh environment and increase the weather window for operations e g delousing net cleaning rovs have tethers that limit their manoeuvrability and increase the risk of entanglement nevertheless they have a transparent and shared control process i e the human controller shares control with an autonomous controller which increases their potential for use in specific applications and environments for instance the shared control provides advantages when handling flexible structures demanding environments with currents and large waves and changing geometry in an undetermined pattern the potential losses for such operations are primarily the loss of life due to human overboard the loss of fish and damage to property the rovs currently adopted in the industry mainly have low loa i e they are remote controlled by an operator rov operation could benefit from more autonomous functionalities to increase inspection quality and effectiveness and reduce operator fatigue bjelland et al 2015 industrial sperre rov technology 2017 and research schjølberg and utne 2015 sintef ocean 2016 efforts have been focusing on developing higher level autonomous rov systems christ and wernli 2014 the proposed approach is applied to an observation class rov provided by a vendor with extensive offshore rov operating experience in the oil and gas industry it engages in developing autonomous functionalities for aquaculture operations the rov is used for net inspection inside the fish cage fig 3 the steps described in the previous section are applied to this operation in the following 3 1 phase 1 define the purpose of the analysis step 1 1 identify losses the main concerning loss in rov net inspection in this case study is the loss of fish which will result in loss of profits loss of reputation and biological degradation of the wild fish stocks step 1 2 identify system level hazards and constraints we primarily focus on the loss of fish due to i failures of the rov to detect existing holes in the net and ii damage to the net caused by the rov itself during operation the scope of the analysis is limited to two system levels hazards h 1 rov is unable to successfully complete the inspection incl holes not detected h 2 rov collides with net structure or tangles with the net additional system level hazards such as the rov leak of hydraulic oil the high voltage electrical hazard frame integrity lost and water leakage into rovs are not considered in this case study table 1 describes the safety constraints that the system conditions or behaviours need to satisfy to prevent hazards and ultimately prevent losses the rov system comprises the rov the handling system the surface control system and all associated equipment the following four rov operational modes are considered in this case study manual control mode mcm station keeping mode skm and relative station keeping mode rskm and net pen tracking mode ntm the rov should be capable of operating in multiple levels of autonomy to ensure operational performance manual control mode loa 1 in this mode the rov operator has direct control of each thruster via operation control e g joysticks or control console the rov operator has visual feedback on display from cameras and data from sensors e g depth sensor compass to steer the rov by sending control forces to the thrusters the steering also includes a heading and depth control system that automatically keeps a given reference heading and depth provided by the operator the raw data from the sensors are filtered to remove noises such as inputs to the control system the desired rpm revolutions per minute is allocated to each thruster accordingly from both the operator s and controller s input the operator is provided with a rough heading and depth indication and the visual feedback to control the rov the control of the position and heading of the rov to compensate for rov dynamics and environmental disturbances i e wind waves and current demands considerable effort from the operator moreover preventing entanglement is dependent on the skill and experience of the rov operator the manual control mode is representative of loa 1 station keeping mode and relative station keeping mode loa 2 the rov is equipped with a dynamic positioning dp system to keep the position and orientation within certain excursion limits sørensen 2012 for the rov to hold its position and move along with the net it depends on data fusion between various navigation sensors the motion control system compensates for environmental disturbance and rov dynamics the navigation system is responsible for estimating the position velocity heading depth and altitude of an rov in a given reference system the navigation sensors need to make the system observable and controllable chen 1998 which may contain a compass a pressure gauge and an ultrashort short or long baseline network consisting of acoustic positioning systems apss doppler velocity log dvl gyroscopes and accelerometers dukan 2014 the rov senses any variation from the desired position determines what thrust vector is required and sends instructions to maintain the position and orientation in this operational mode the rov operator has the authority to take over control and control the thrusters directly in this case the operation switches modes from loa2 to loa1 relative station keeping is similar to station keeping but instead of maintaining a constant position and heading the rov will maintain a constant distance and relative heading to the net the initiation of relative station keeping requires the rov to be close and pointing towards the net pen net pen tracking mode loa 3 the net pen tracking is a desired semi autonomous operation functionality loa 3 within aquaculture currently under research duda et al 2015 rundtop and frank 2016 in this mode the rov follows the shape of the net to perform the inspection autonomously nonetheless obtaining the relative position of the net pen is challenging as the net pen deforms by current induced drag forces which makes it an undetermined shape lader et al 2008 for instance a current velocity of 0 5 m s may lead to a 20 volume reduction in an exposed net pen lader et al 2008 in this mode dvl may function as a net relative sensor to provide net pen relative velocities range and heading when the rov is directed towards the net pen the desired velocities of the rov can then be generated as the rov moves along the varying net pen using the relative net pen measurements the guidance system of the rov produces the desired reference velocity aiming to keep the rov with a fixed net pen relative range and heading and keeping a plan for traversing the whole net pen using the navigation system and the dynamics of the rov note that the guidance system does not require prior knowledge of the whole net pen in the net pen tracking mode the rov operator is a supervisor having the authority to intervene in case of an emergency or change of mission plan this can be achieved by overriding i e switch to station keeping mode or relative station keeping mode or directly control the thrusters using joysticks i e switch to manual control mode in this mode the operator provides a mission i e an inspection of the whole net cage with the rov containing specific safe navigation rules in the presence of moving or static obstacles as an input to path re planning a set of waypoints are established according to the mission plan the weather the operation among other factors a smooth feasible trajectory is generated so that the rov can follow the raw data from the sensors including images from the camera are processed into the navigation system to give the relative net pen position position measurement velocity and heading estimates based on relative net pen position and position measurement a map is generated during operation to enhance the operator s operation monitoring an example of such a representation of a fish cage is a 3d occupancy grid map hornung et al 2013 which is sent to the graphical user interface gui step 1 4 describe tasks involving different operational mode net inspection task to initiate the net inspection task the operator launches the rov into the fish cage the mission is to traverse and inspect the entire fish cage the rov is initially set to manual control mode and manually manoeuvred to the side of the net the operator configures the rov for the preferred relative distance and heading to the net as well as the desired velocity once the rov is in position the operator activates the net pen tracking mode the net inspection process is initiated and the rov operator supervises the operation and handles the rov tether in case a hole is detected by the rov the relative station keeping mode is automatically activated and an alarm is sent to the gui to bring rov operator s attention to the detected hole the hole is examined and logged and the rov operator reactivates the net pen tracking mode to continue the inspection if the rov is tangled in the ropes inside the cage the station keeping mode is activated and at the same time the rov operator is informed the operator turns the rov to manual mode to untangle itself if the rov is tangled in the net the rov operator is informed and the thrusters are automatically turned off a further investigation of the situation will then be needed to decide how to proceed when obstacles are detected on the planned path i e the produced desired trajectory safe navigation rules are applied and the rov operator is informed if the operator disagrees with the rule in certain situations the rov is switched to manual control mode and the operator takes over to manoeuvre it to a safe location and net pen tracking mode is reactivated fig 4 illustrates the main tasks performed during the net inspection and the operation modes involved 3 2 phase 2 model the control structures fig 5 summarizes results from steps 2 1 2 5 in phase 2 step 2 1 model control structure step 2 2 assign responsibilities step 2 3 derive feedbacks step 2 4 repeat for each operational mode step 2 5 identify differences among modes the control structures focus on two controllers the human operator and rov controller rov controllers need to collaborate to complete a mission by switching between operational modes at different loas upon different operational contexts the lists of responsibilities specify the tasks each agent needs to accomplish for the safety constrains to be enforced due to limited space fig 5 presents partial examples of assigned responsibilities at each operational mode for net inspection function and collision avoidance with their corresponding process models and feedback note that the relative station keeping is not demonstrated separately due to its similarity with the station keeping mode and net pen tracking mode the steps 2 1 2 5 are combined in one figure for the convenience of comparison among different operational modes 3 3 phase 3 identify unsafe control actions step 3 2 identify operational mode transitions the functional transitions between the four operational modes and shutdown mode are shown in fig 6 step 3 3 identify triggering events the triggering events for the rov operational mode transition can be divided into two categories external stimuli and internal stimuli as defined in section 2 3 the triggering events are summarized in fig 7 and exemplified in table 2 external stimuli when an rov is on a mission the human operator is an external stimulus who has the highest authority the operator can always activate a transition of operational mode following a call event e g a request from an rov operator another type of external stimulus is the change event which covers the detection of interest e g detect a hole in the net a change in environmental features and a detection of environmental objects the operational environment is critical to an rov operation and environmental interactions and consequent changes in environmental features should be anticipated however as pointed by dogramadzi et al 2014 the existing hazard identification methods do not encourage the safety analysis to consider different types of environmental interactions as an input to ensure safe robot operations changes in the environmental features are often associated with a change in sea conditions e g sea state a strong wind strong current and tides poor visibility due to fog or rain salinity the detection of environmental obstacles includes the detection of objects and agents obstacles are related to obstructions to vehicle movements such as fixed structures surface floating obstructions e g ships buoys anchor chains objects suspended in the water column e g fishing lines loose netting and bottom obstructions e g subsurface structures wrecks christ and wernli sr 2014 on the other hand agents are the objects purposefully moving in the environment four categories of agents are suggested to capture the full range of behavioural patterns that any agent may exhibit and need to be perceived by the robot dogramadzi et al 2014 they could be unintelligent automatic systems autonomous systems other robots animals and humans internal stimuli internal stimuli take place within the rov which can cover timeout events change events and completion events timeout events may fire the transition when other awaited events do not occur within the specified time interval the change events mainly originate from deviations of rov performance such as deviations in functional performance technical failures and software failures an additional triggering event or completion event could also automatically initiate the transition from working mode to shutdown mode the rov operator and rov controller share the control and generate control actions following their responsibilities and update their process models based on feedback table 3 presents the responsibilities and process models that would enable a successful transition by a collaboration between the rov operator and rov controller the process model is described by the status of process variables that would lead to a successful transition note that table 3 explicitly describes the operator s responsibility of supervising the mission in cases where the operator s attention must be directed to one aspect of the operation e g collision avoidance nonetheless in addition to the ones identified in table 3 the operator is responsible for the supervision of operations at all times and maintaining a situational awareness concerning the rov mission and surrounding variables table 4 presents the utcas for both the rov operator and rov controller for transition actions the utcas are identified by considering the contexts for transition responsibilities and process models described in table 3 3 4 phase 4 identify loss scenarios the next step is to identify scenarios and causal factors for each uca so that related safety constraints for safe transitions can be further detailed and refined in table 5 table 6 table 7 table 8 some causal scenarios causal factors and related safety constraints for selected ucas are presented 4 discussion 4 1 findings from the case study the rov used in the case study is a representative autonomous marine system that has frequent operational mode transitions due to complex operating contexts inside of a confined area i e inside of a fish cage the rov operator and rov controller must collaborate closely to avoid tether entanglement damage to the net structure as well as inspect report and temporarily block the holes if necessary in the net in time the dynamic autonomy brought by shifting between various operational modes that have different loas adds an additional layer of complexity to ensure safe operation however this functionality has not been well addressed in current hazard identification methods as commented on by hollnagel 2005 co agency specifically needs to be emphasized with a sound underlying model of the processes in this study we proposed an approach based on stpa and a simplified state transition diagram in which a more explicit model of operational mode transitions is provided the proposed method contributes to clearly communicating the shift of responsibilities by specifying i how the allocation of the responsibility between human operators and the rov controller changes under each operational mode ii what updated process model of the operator and the controller are to ensure a successful transition the proposed approach makes it more visible as to what changes occur in the system when the operating mode is changed the clarification of responsibilities under various situations can prepare the rov operator better during the operation for example in ntm the rov needs to make decisions by itself to switch to rskm or skm and bring the rov operator s attention to deal with the situation the rov operator is required to observe the deviations of functional performance and react promptly to take over i e switch to mcm or assist in switching mode when the rov entangles with the net and fails to turn off its thrusters the rov operator must detect the emergency as soon as possible and manually shut down the rov another example is the situation that the turbidity is too high that the camera optics are significantly degraded if the rov does not switch to skm automatically the operator should manually activate the skm in time before the rov goes too far in the detection the holes in the net might be missed the refined safety constraints based on the proposed approach also contribute to successfully completing a commission when there are dynamic control structures within one system some refined safety constraints from the case study especially emphasized the ensuring of safe transitions examples are as follows the proposed collision avoidance path must be displayed in gui to the rov operator the rov operator must be notified when the operational mode switches when the camera loses signals and does not respond to the rov operator for a certain amount of time the rov must be shut down and floated to the surface the rov operator should be informed when objects enter dangerous zones regardless of an evaluated no collision risk by the rov controller training must be provided to the rov operator to help become familiar with the capabilities of the system in various operational modes and another separate operator should be assigned for tether management the refined safety constraints are more concrete and can be input to improve system design and operational procedures when the higher level autonomy is integrated into the system the smooth transition faces the challenges of human action hazards such as skill degradation loss of engagement workload spikes a lack of predictability associated with autonomous systems and their overall complexity endsley 2019 the human action hazards in terms utcas for rov operators causal scenarios and the causal factors behind need to be well considered while refining safety constraints for example it is clear from the results that the object avoidance functionality is not available in the skm and rskm modes without knowing the limitation rov operator may come to select the rskm when an object is approaching on a collision course i e how ntm rskm uca operator 4 in table 8 may occur in the case study the proposed approach focuses on mode transitions and as such does not cover all aspects of the rov however the analysis can be extended using standard stpa to analyse each operational mode and identify corresponding unsafe control actions and scenarios when the rov is operated under such a mode to limit the scope of this study the above mentioned analysis is not included in the case study 4 2 limitations and possibilities of proposed approach for autonomous operations investigating hazard identification for autonomous marine systems and operations in general can rapidly transform into a considerable effort nonetheless it is a critical topic to be investigated the proposed approach offers possibilities of application beyond the rov case study presented in this paper for a large part of possible applications of autonomy autonomous systems with a loa as high as fully autonomous in which no human would be necessary or supervision tasks or remote control is not expected in the near future in this sense these systems also have shared control many of them may also have possibilities of changing loas during the operations an example is autonomous ships which are also expected to have dynamic loa for instance when unmooring out of a harbour with heavy traffic the ship can be controlled by operators working onshore remote control and change the loa to a higher level when reaching deep water with low traffic ramos et al 2019b moreover in case of a possible collision scenario the operator may take over control of the ship switching the loa back to the remote control indeed ramos et al 2020 states that the strong reliance on human system interaction shared control and dynamic loa present a challenge for risk assessments for autonomous ships the proposed approach allows for identifying triggering events for modes transition this is particularly relevant for analysis of marine systems which operate in a dynamic and complex environment the existing hazard identification methods do not consider different types of environmental interaction systematically and sufficiently dogramadzi et al 2014 the anticipation of possible environmental interactions is critical for a safe autonomous marine operation particularly when the systems are moving toward the direction of being fully autonomous the proposed method systematically identifies triggering events for transitions by dividing the events into external stimuli and internal stimuli events and further into change event timeout event call event and completion event the results can serve as a basis to define triggering events in the design phase for other types of autonomous marine systems such as autonomous ships as well it is worth noting that in some situations simultaneous triggering events can create decision dilemmas for example when the rov detects a suspected hole in the net the rov controller automatically switches to relative station keeping mode so that the hole can be logged and a further investigation can be carried out if at the same time an agent is detected moving towards the rov the collision avoidance function is expected to be activated automatically as well under such a context the best strategy might be to send a notification to the rov operator and let the operator take over control to avoid a collision and then move back to a location to log information on the hole if the hole is too big that fish start to escape as an emergency procedure the rov should temporarily block the hole to mitigate fish escape until a remedy is implemented e g send divers to repair in such an emergent situation the collision risk from moving the agent might be neglected the identification of such decision dilemmas and the definition of corresponding strategies are critical to a robust and safe design of autonomous systems the use of the proposed approach can shed light on identifying such dilemmas through defined external and internal stimuli events or conditions this issue is not within the scope of this study but will be researched in further work furthermore this study does not include the effects due to the interaction of external stimuli and internal stimuli e g a stronger current and control system crash broader scenarios considering the possible interactions should be established in the later stage of stpa the literature presents stpa as a valuable method for hazard identification of autonomous and remotely controlled ships operation wróbel et al 2018a b and the applicability to other autonomous marine systems needs to be tested in further work the different characteristics operating environment sensing motion and reaction capabilities may bring new insights into the method to this moment stpa applications have not explicitly explored the hazards arising from control modes transition the approach presented in this paper which needs to be validated for other autonomous systems can be an initial step towards the consideration of the important feature of control mode transition in stpa 5 conclusion this paper addresses the challenge of analysing the risk of autonomous marine systems focusing on the first step of risk analysis namely hazard identification autonomous systems may switch between different modes of operation and levels of autonomy which increases the complexity in particular with respect to interactions between the human operator supervisor software hardware and the environmental conditions these interactions impact risk but are challenging to identify and analyse this aspect has not been paid enough attention in risk and safety studies of autonomous marine systems the proposed approach in the paper uses stpa as a foundation but explicitly includes dynamic control hierarchies representing the different loa and focuses on identifying unsafe transition control actions scenarios and causal factors the proposed approach is exemplified for an rov but is expected to be relevant for other autonomous marine systems such as autonomous ships the results from the case study indicate that clarification of allocated responsibilities and updated process model of the operator and the controller are critical factors to ensure a safe operation the defined safety constraints as a result focus specially on how to ensure the responsibilities and updated process models to be communicated clearly among controllers the proposed classification of triggering events shed light on the systematic identification of possible environmental interactions to improve the design of autonomous marine systems further work includes applying and testing the proposed method in a wide selection of domains to further improve and develop a systematic approach to identify the triggering events and conditions for modes transition as input to eliminating hazards that

21392,undulating propulsion is promising solution for underwater vehicles used in subsea security systems especially due to its low noise better energetic efficiency low water turbulence and living animals mimicry the design of the biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicle bauv for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr built in the sabuvis project is presented in the paper the shape of the vehicle hull was inspired by living fish key aspects of the design and construction of bauv needed to achieve tasks required to be performed by the robot are described two research questions are stated in the paper how big drag forces act on a biomimetic underwater vehicle and how mechanical design influences the noise level generated by the vehicle to answer these questions vehicle forward velocity hull drag added mass and generated noise were investigated forces acting on the bauv hull while being pulled forward and sideways were measured noise generated by the vehicle was also measured for two types of propulsors drives in order to select those with the lower sound pressure level quantitative results of drag and noise obtained in the research are important for designers of mechanical structures of useful full scale biomimetic underwater robots and their control subsystems keywords biomimetic robotic fish underwater robot noise measurements drag measurements 1 introduction aquatic animals provide a primary source of inspiration for the design of underwater robotic devices built in accordance with biological locomotion principles taking into consideration robotics literature fish are aquatic creatures that inspire a large number of scientist and engineers to build fish like underwater vehicles unfortunately modern technology is still unable to imitate the full features of fish locomotion developed during a long period of evolution this locomotion is very complex lauder and tangorra 2015 fish swim using interaction forces between their bodies undulations and the surrounding water the thrust is generated by two distinct propulsion modes bcf body and or caudal fin undulatory propulsion and mpf median and or paired fin oscillatory propulsion the bcf mode is further divided into five distinct types of fish locomotion anguilliform subcarangiform carangiform tuniform and ostraciiform based on the length the fish body that undulates during motion sfakiotakis et al 1999 many references to propulsion modes can be found in the review articles salazar et al 2018 scaradozzi et al 2017 sfakiotakis et al 1999 lauder and tangorra 2015 however came to the conclusion that the division of fish swimming methods into two categories bcf or mpf is completely artificial and it is important to note that most species use their bodies and fins at the same time while swimming an analysis of the literature of the subject confirms that the benefits of using a bio inspired propulsion system in a harsh marine environment are driving a growing interest of the scientific research and industrial community the rest of the paper has been organized as follows section 2 gives an overview of related works in section 3 a new design of fish like vehicle and its implementation are discussed section 4 is devoted to estimation of the vehicle hull drag using experimental research some aspects concerning noise study of applied motors integrated with planetary gearboxes are presented in section 5 finally the last section concludes the paper with the future direction of research 2 review of previous work over the last three decades much effort has been devoted to the design of biomimetic underwater vehicles the transfer of fish biological capabilities to engineered devices is a real challenge fish like biomimetic vehicles are practically useful but they do not represent complex behaviour characteristic of a real fish most of them implement only a few of the features of fish locomotion such as high propulsive efficiency and impeccable manoeuvrability sfakiotakis et al 1999 moreover low underwater acoustic noise is always a useful feature these advantages are very beneficial for potential applications such as aquatic life form observation oceanic supervision undersea environmental monitoring intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr mine detection military activities and so on in the case of underwater vehicles a bio inspired propulsion system provides better swimming performance at low speeds and quieter operation than traditional screw propellers fish 2013 to properly design a fish like underwater vehicle it is necessary to understand the interaction between the submerged moving vehicle and the surrounding incompressible and dense fluid when the fish moves its body and fins are in relation to the surrounding fluid the fluid is moved and reaction forces arise the main momentum transfer mechanisms are via drag lift and acceleration reaction forces the swimming drag consists of three components namely viscous or friction drag form drag and vortex shedding or induced drag sfakiotakis et al 1999 friction drag arises as a result of the viscosity of water in areas of flow with large velocity gradients form drag is caused by the distortion of flow around the fish s body and depends on its shape while induced drag depends largely on the shape of the fins the form and induced drag are collectively referred to as pressure drag the robotic fish hull is used to store onboard devices like drives batteries sensors and computers the hull must have a hydrodynamic shape in order to minimize drag force along the longitudinal axis of the vehicle reducing the drag of the hull is required to improve the endurance necessary in long distance underwater travel in order to achieve better energy utilization it is necessary to optimize the hull based on the correct drag estimation barrett et al 1999 the high vehicle hull transverse drag as well as the drag moment in the robot vertical axis on the other hand is beneficial as it helps to minimize unwanted oscillations and stabilizes the robot path anderson 2006 several papers can be found that deal with robotic fish hull drag estimation chan et al 2007 hyakudome et al 2011 mcletchie 2003 using experimental and numerical techniques the hull drag must be overcome by the thrust generated by the oscillating tail and fins estimation of this thrust may be a real challenge for the big vehicles cfd analysis may be one of the solutions in this case but robot fins must be modelled as rigid parts due to limitations of the simulation costa et al 2018b with small scale fish like robots or just their propulsion systems single fins the experimental setup can be fairly easily arranged in the small water tunnel costa et al 2018a the thrust generated by the oscillating tail and fins is then measured with different velocities of the surrounding water and the rigidity of fins is not required as in cfd analysis low et al 2010 an underwater robot is one of the most important pieces of ocean equipment and especially its stealth zhou 2016 low underwater acoustic noise is one of the basic requirements for bio inspired vehicles acoustic methods have been proved to be the most effective means for underwater target detection nie et al 2014 piskur and szymak 2017 the acoustic stealth of a submerged object has been an area of interest for many years sources of noise of a submarine are divided into propeller noise hydrodynamic noise and mechanical structure noise liu et al 2019 zhou 2016 hydrodynamic flow noise for small underwater vehicles is minimal if speed travel is less than 0 5 m s ferguson et al 2010 the paper tsukioka et al 2002 presents results of mechanical noise reduction in auv urashima in which reduction gear was changed from spur gear to helical one most research work concerning the study of underwater biomimetic vehicles is carried out for small sized vehicles the sizes of models described in the literature are up to tens of centimetres in length and with masses up to a few kilograms vehicles presented in the literature are usually small models built to study different aspects of biomimetic underwater robots like new propulsion mechanisms and fins materials mignano et al 2019 raj and thakur 2016 manoeuvrability li et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 control xie and du 2019 acoustic communication shatara and tan 2010 thrust mignano et al 2019 drag and added mass chan and kang 2011 gibouin et al 2018 the studied vehicles are not equipped with devices to make them useful for underwater work or little data about the equipment is given these papers provide valuable information about the above mentioned aspects of biomimetic vehicle operation however apart from the scientific interest paid to underwater biomimetic robotics the applicative issues also deserve attention thus the contribution of the paper is i the presentation of the biomimetic underwater vehicle designed built and equipped to execute isr tasks ii the measurement of the vehicle s velocity drag force and added mass iii the quantitative study of noise generated by the vehicle for two different types of installed drives the presented research is carried out for the fully functional vehicle able to work in outdoor water regions like lakes and seas 3 design and implementation of fish like vehicle the essential assumptions of bauv design were to i implement undulating propulsion which would act as silently as possible ii fit all the equipment necessary to perform isr tasks maintaining fish like shape of the hull iii keep the dimensions and weight as small as possible iv ensure that the vehicle would be able to dive down up to 40m the bauv hull design was inspired by the shape of a carp fish body mainly because it is laterally flattened and has a high ridge these shape features are desirable due to the convenience of the internal equipment arrangement the possibility to maintain big enough metacentric height and maintain the vehicle static stability are also important as the bauv was based on the carp its motion type can be characterized as subcarangiform but taking into consideration the length of the undulating part of the vehicle in comparison to the total length of the bauv it can be classified as carangiform because the length of its tail is almost one third of the total length of the vehicle in order to design the bauv hull external shape similar to a living fish a real carp body was scanned using romer omega r scan 3d scanner the obtained cloud of points was then imported into cad software and a digital 3d model of the fish body was generated fig 1 then the model of fish s body was scaled up to fulfil the requirements for the vehicle all the robot internal equipment such as drives drivetrains batteries power supply subsystem control computers and sensors were enclosed in the scaled up external fish like shape the majority of the hull elements are made out of pom polyoxymethylene some parts of the hull are aluminium to help with the internal heat dissipation and withstand excessive wear additional internal walls are added to reinforce the hull in the areas where large lateral surfaces are and in consequence higher stress due to water pressure occurs the entire hull was divided into 5 major sections section a the head section b the middle body section c the rear body section d the first tail segment section e the second tail segment additionally all major sections except section e were divided into three elements along the vehicle s longitudinal plane of symmetry in order to simplify the manufacturing process assembly of the internal devices and maintenance services thus each section of the hull and the first section of the tail is composed of the middle part and two symmetrical lids screwed on both sides of it all sections are connected in series with one another using screws located inside the hull there are o rings sealings placed between the lids and the middle part of each section as well as between sections two additional small lids are mounted to the first section s lids in places where pectoral fin shafts stick out of the hull these small lids cover pectoral fins drivetrains both the pectoral fins consist of a front rigid part and a rear elastic ending similarly each lid of section b is composed of two parts the bigger one is made of pom and the smaller one located in the lower part of the bigger one is made of aluminium which helps dissipate heat from the bauv interior additionally these aluminium lids cover battery compartment thus replacing robot batteries does not require removing the bigger lids of section b the last robot hull section second section of the tail is composed of two symmetrical hollow parts filled with buoyancy foam to achieve the proper trim of the vehicle an elastic caudal fin is mounted at the end of section e the bauv buoyancy is adjusted to be slightly positive by means of additional leaden weights distributed inside cavities in the streamlined beam attached underneath the hull this beam with additional weights is attached to the hull by an electromagnet and can be dropped in emergency situations causing the vehicle to emerge views of the bauv with its equipment are presented in fig 2 whereas the main parameters of the vehicle are presented in table 1 list of the vehicle s main equipment is presented in table 2 the bauv tail is driven by two maxon ec i servomotors whose oscillatory movements are properly synchronized to generate the undulating motion of the tail the first tail servomotor with an integrated planetary gearbox and encoder is located perpendicular to the vehicle s longitudinal axis inside section c and drives section d the first tail segment through additional belt transmission the second tail servomotor with an integrated planetary gearbox and encoder is placed parallel to the vehicle s longitudinal axis inside section d and drives section e the second tail segment through an additional bevel gear wires of the second servomotor are conducted through the hollow shaft of the first tail segment into section c where the tail servomotors controllers are placed each pectoral fin of the vehicle is driven by an independent maxon ec i servomotor with an integrated planetary gearbox and encoder through an additional belt transmission the pectoral fins servomotors controllers are located inside section a the bauv is also equipped with a cylindrical ballast tank whose inner volume can be precisely controlled by means of a moving piston lead screw belt transmission and servomotor with an integrated planetary gearbox and encoder all the components form the so called variable buoyancy system vbs which is located in the upper part of section b and is connected with a water inlet on the hull wall using an elastic hose the vbs drive controller is placed in section b all the servomotors controllers are daisy chained and connected to the common can bus which is used to exchange data with the robot control system located in section a an extra dc motor with a worm gear and custom made controller is used to erect or fold a movable mast on which the video camcorder and antennas are mounted the mast can be either folded or erected no in between position is possible while swimming the vehicle drives are executing motion according to the following formulas angular

pectoral fins mean value of oscillation a b is the speed of piston moving inside the cylinder of the vbs all the above parameters are controlled according to so called fish like motion patterns which are different for various robot tasks a more detailed description of motion of similar bauv can be found in the authors previous work morawski et al 2018 the vehicle control system is based on two pci104 computers the first one is responsible for low level control data acquisition from sensors and sensory data pre processing the second computer is responsible for high level control which guides the vehicle to autonomously move along the pre programmed path avoiding collisions with stationary obstacles in robot sensory system two types of sensors are used sensors responsible for providing navigational information and the robot s state belong to the first group the second type sensors are the ones used in mission execution sensors which provide navigational data and bauv state information are doppler velocity log dvl mounted on the bottom side of section b and pointing towards the seafloor measures the vehicle s velocity relative to ground paddle wheel log pwl mounted on the bottom side of section a measures the vehicle s velocity relative to surrounding water fibre optic gyro fog with integrated inertial measurement unit imu and global navigation satellite system gnss receiver mounted inside section b close to the vehicle s centre of gravity provides information about the vehicle s position latitude longitude attitude when gnss signal is available orientation euler angles linear accelerations and angular rates in 3 axes absolute pressure sensor mounted in section a measures hydrostatic pressure and indirectly the vehicle s depth three leak sensors mounted at the inner bottom part of sections a b and c provide information about potential hull leaks battery management system integrated with battery packs measures the state of charge voltage current drawn from each battery and estimates time to system shutdown due to low battery voltage mission specific sensors are high resolution camcorder mounted on the erectable mast which is capable of registering either underwater or above surface video images depending on the position of the mast mechanical scanning sonar mounted in front of the vehicle used to register images of underwater infrastructure as well as detect obstacles on the bauv s path side scan sonar with two transducers mounted on both sides of the lower part of section b used to register images of the seafloor communication with the vehicle is carried out using one of three wireless channels a 2 4 ghz radio link or 868mhz radio modem when the vehicle is emerged and an acoustic modem underwater the communication subsystem dynamically switches the channel based on the quality of the signal to achieve the highest possible data rate communication with the bauv can be also established using tether but this feature was added only for testing purposes in the swimming pool tether is detachable from the vehicle by means of a watertight junction located on the upper side of section b antennas for radio communication are mounted on top of the erectable mast whereas the acoustic modem s spherical transceiver is placed on top of section b near two sockets for battery charging and tether connection the view of the bauv during tests in the baltic sea is presented in fig 3 4 study of the drag in order to estimate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the bauv the authors measured the drag coefficient of the hull and added the mass of neighbouring water when the vehicle was pulled with constant force along a straight line in the swimming pool in those tests the tail undulation and pectoral fins oscillations were turned off in order to measure the hull drag only the test stand utilizing a six axis force and moments sensor hoisting winch driven by a brushless direct current motor with an incremental encoder and planetary gearhead motor controller stainless steel frame system of pulleys and steel string was constructed for this purpose in the arrangement presented in fig 4 the winding drum with a 2 mm thick steel string was attached to the output shaft of the planetary gearhead integrated with the bldc maxon ec i40 100w motor powered by a dedicated maxon epos 50 5 bldc motor controller the reduction ratio of the gearhead was 1 21 the motor was attached to the one side of the ft axia 80 force sensor with range of 200 n the other side of the force sensor was attached to the base of the hoisting winch which was fixed to the side of the swimming pool the motor controller was connected to the laptop computer via usb interface in order to set motion parameters and register the actual moving speed of the motor the force sensor was also connected to the computer via the ethernet connection thus the forces were measured in real time the force sensor measured forces in three axes of the cartesian reference frame additionally the sensor measured moments of forces around those axes the free end of the steel string was attached to the bauv through a pulley the pulley was attached to the stainless steel frame submerged in the pool and immobilized at the bottom by additional weights the bauv was submerged at the same depth approximately 1m as the pulley in the experiment the bauv was pulled horizontally with a constant force achieved by the winch motor which was powered in constant current constant torque mode by the motor controller the speed of the bauv was calculated based on measurements of motor speed and geometry of the pulley system the friction force of the pulley was estimated in the laboratory with the same arrangement of the test stand as in the swimming pool using the experimental setup presented above the vehicle s motion along the pulling direction can be described by equation 4 1 derived from second newton s law with quadratic drag force this mathematical model is used by researchers to describe the one dimensional motion of the hull of a fish robot chan et al 2007 chan and kang 2011 4 1 m r d v t d t f e 0 5 c d ρ a v t 2 where m r inertia of all the

tanh c d ρ a 2 f f e m r t bauv maximum velocity is v m 2 f e c d ρ a a time offset value t 0 should be added in equation 4 4 because in the experiment the starting moment of bauv was not synchronized

5 best fits the experimental data using the least squares method then using 4 2 added mass m a was calculated in equation 4 1 the drag was modelled by a single drag coefficient c d which includes all the drag components along the pulling direction in the experiment the bauv was pulled forward with four set values of the motor current i 1 a 1 2 a 1 5 a 2 a which in consequence gave four values of the motor torque the motor current was stabilized by the motor controller with the pi algorithm current controller parameters were tuned beforehand thus a constant stabilized pulling force was achieved which was measured by the force sensor bauv speed and pulling force measurements were repeated three times for a given set current of the motor selected averaged results are presented in table 3 the bauv velocities obtained from expression 4 5 with t 0 0 for data presented in table 3 are shown in fig 5 the range of maximal vehicle velocities obtained in the experiment is typical for the bauv during mission execution thus calculated c d and m a values are practically useful in estimation of motion parameters by odometric navigation subsystem of the vehicle graphs presented in fig 6 depict measured speeds of the bauv with fitted curves for three repetitions of the second trial second row of table 3 there can be seen oscillations of bauv measured velocity around its maximal value which can be caused by the tension of the pulling string when the pulling force is almost equal to drag force estimated parameters and curve fitting index for the data presented in fig 6 are given in table 4 a similar experimental setup was used to measure speed changes when the vehicle was pulled sideways in this case the bauv cross section was a 0 572 m 2 the experiment showed that with similar effective forces acting on the hull as in the forward pulling direction the vehicle velocities are from 19 to 21 of those obtained for forward pulling direction which corresponds to the change in the vehicle s cross section drag coefficients are four to five times higher for effective pulling force f e 8 6 n the vehicle s maximal velocity was 0 124 m s the drag coefficient was 1 94 and added mass was 181 3 k g 5 noise study to drive the biomimetic propulsion system tail pectoral fins and vbs bldc maxon motors ec i series integrated with planetary gearboxes were used to check the influence of vehicle design on the generated noise two types of gearboxes were used standard and with reduced backlash the noise was measured for the vehicle being held in place in a laboratory pool of the size of 5 1 2 6 1 m3 length x width x depth the hydrophone was located in front of the vehicle at a distance of 1 3 m and depth of 0 4 m the vehicle was submerged at the same depth as the hydrophone to measure the noise generated by the vehicle hti 96 min hydrophone was used the gain of the hydrophone is k d b 169 7 d b with reference gain k r e f 1 v μ p a thus after recalculation the gain is k 3 27 m v p a to register sound pressure level spl crio 9024 system with n9215 voltage input module and a custom built software application were used spl signal after removal of the dc component registered for the vehicle equipped with standard gearboxes and with tail motion only is presented in fig 7 during this measurement the tail was working with the following parameters a t 1 0 38 r a d ϕ t 1 0 94 r a d a t 2 1 03 r a d ϕ t 2 4 52 r a d and f t 0 8 h z for the presented example rms value of spl equals to p r m s 2 2 10 6 μ p a what is p d b 127 d b with reference pressure equal to 1 μ p a the peaks of the signal which occur five times per second result from mechanical scanning sonar operation additional peaks taking place every 1 25 s correspond to the tail s oscillation frequency which is 0 8 hz and result from the gearbox backlash the graph of obtained spl after replacement of standard gearboxes with the ones with reduced backlash and the same motion parameters is shown in fig 8 in this case rms value of spl is lowered to p r m s 1 3 10 6 μ p a that is p d b 122 d b noise measurements for tail pectoral fins and vbs working separately were carried out in the experiment motion parameters and spl measured before and after the replacement of standard gearboxes with ones with reduced backlash are presented in table 5 the mean value of background noise was 119 0 db comparison of noise generated by variable buoyancy system with standard and reduced backlash gearboxes is presented below fig 9 and fig 10 the measurement shows significant noise reduction especially in the frequency range from 1 to 4 khz 6 conclusions in this paper the design of fully functional biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicle built for performing intelligence surveillance reconnaissance was presented the vehicle can also be used as a member of a cooperative system of multiple similar fish like robots or the leader for a system of less equipped fish like robots bauv sensors control units drives batteries required to execute a mission determine the vehicle s dimensions all the vehicle equipment is enclosed in the fish like hull to provide maximal similarity to a real life fish one of the important features which influences the effectiveness of the undulating propulsion is the shape of the hull of the underwater vehicle so the robot s hull was developed based on bioinspiration by the application of a scaled up shape of carp fish body which should result in a low drag force for such a real structure experimental studies of selected parameters were carried out when it comes to control of the vehicle during its operation parameters of its dynamic model are used vehicle velocity in time for constant pulling force was registered in the research measured terminal velocities together with pulling forces allowed for calculating drag coefficients for two directions of pulling of the vehicle forward and sideways assuming drag force to be proportional to the velocity squared based on analytical solution added masses were found out due to limited accuracy of measuring speed in vertical direction drag coefficients and added masses were calculated for forward and sideways pulling directions only this issue is going to be addressed in future work the results show that added mass and drag coefficient decrease with increasing vehicle velocity obtained the drag coefficient c d values from 0 45 to 0 61 are smaller than those from the literature 0 70 0 75 chan et al 2007 chan and kang 2011 it proves that proposed implementation of real fish shape in the design of the bauv gives good results a more thorough investigation is required since to solve motion differential equation following other researchers approach the drag coefficient and added mass values were assumed to be independent of the vehicle motion parameters added masses obtained in the experiment 46 8 kg 85 0 kg are much higher than those in the reference literature chan et al 2007 chan and kang 2011 but since they depend on the size shape and motion parameters of the vehicle cannot be compared directly to address this subject more research is required the authors plan further experiments with the use of higher accuracy speed measurement system in the experiment the bauv biomimetic propulsion was turned off to measure dynamic parameters of the hull only the thrust generated by biomimetic propulsion and its influence on the vehicle dynamic will be addressed in the future work for isr tasks for which the vehicle is designed low acoustic profile is required thus the presented research includes measurements of noise generated by the vehicle to assess the influence of the mechanical structure on the noise level two types of drives were checked the first with standard and the second with reduced backlash gearboxes the generated noise was reduced by 7 db in average 9 db for variable buoyancy system drives 8 db for the tail drives 5 db for the pectoral fins the mechanical scanning sonar installed in front of the vehicle generates significant peaks in the acoustic signals but it is not essential to mission execution thus when the low noise mode of operation is required the sonar should be turned off in specific situations most of the biomimetic vehicles described in the subject literature are small scaled physical models designed to execute laboratory tests thus obtained results of noise and drag cannot be applied to full scale vehicles the research presented in the paper is executed for a fully functional vehicle and therefore the results can be used as input parameters for autonomous control system during mission execution the results are an essential contribution to the established parameters of a dynamic model of a functional vehicle for linear motion and they allow finding i vehicle response to a change of thrust force ii how much time is required to change vehicle speed by defined amount iii maximum velocity for a given thrust iv required mechanical power to operate at a given speed quantitative results of drag and noise obtained in the research may be useful for designers of mechanical structures of full scale biomimetic underwater robots and their control subsystems based on the above summary the future work will include measurements of the vehicle s hull drag coefficient and added mass in the vertical direction comparison of the measured drag coefficients and added masses with the results of cfd analysis the study of the influence of the buv s hull oscillations on the drag coefficients and added masses while the vehicle is propelled by the tail and pectoral fins funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or

21392,undulating propulsion is promising solution for underwater vehicles used in subsea security systems especially due to its low noise better energetic efficiency low water turbulence and living animals mimicry the design of the biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicle bauv for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr built in the sabuvis project is presented in the paper the shape of the vehicle hull was inspired by living fish key aspects of the design and construction of bauv needed to achieve tasks required to be performed by the robot are described two research questions are stated in the paper how big drag forces act on a biomimetic underwater vehicle and how mechanical design influences the noise level generated by the vehicle to answer these questions vehicle forward velocity hull drag added mass and generated noise were investigated forces acting on the bauv hull while being pulled forward and sideways were measured noise generated by the vehicle was also

mechanical structures of useful full scale biomimetic underwater robots and their control subsystems keywords biomimetic robotic fish underwater robot noise measurements drag measurements 1 introduction aquatic animals provide a primary source of inspiration for the design of underwater robotic devices built in accordance with biological locomotion principles taking into consideration robotics literature fish are aquatic creatures that inspire a large number of scientist and engineers to build fish like underwater vehicles unfortunately modern technology is still unable to imitate the full features of fish locomotion developed during a long period of evolution this locomotion is very complex lauder and tangorra 2015 fish swim using interaction forces between their bodies undulations and the surrounding water the thrust is generated by two distinct propulsion modes bcf body and or caudal fin undulatory propulsion and mpf median and or paired fin oscillatory propulsion the bcf mode is further divided into five distinct types of fish locomotion anguilliform subcarangiform carangiform tuniform and ostraciiform based on the length the fish body that undulates during motion sfakiotakis et al 1999 many references to propulsion modes can be found in the review articles salazar et al 2018 scaradozzi et al 2017 sfakiotakis et al 1999 lauder and tangorra 2015 however came to the conclusion that the division of fish swimming methods into two categories bcf or mpf is completely artificial and it is important to note that most species use their bodies and fins at the same time while swimming an analysis of the literature of the subject confirms that the benefits of using a bio inspired propulsion system in a harsh marine environment are driving a growing interest of the scientific research and industrial community the rest of the paper has been organized as follows section 2 gives an overview of related works in section 3 a new design of fish like vehicle and its implementation are discussed section 4 is devoted to estimation of the vehicle hull drag using experimental research some aspects concerning noise study of applied motors integrated with planetary gearboxes are presented in section 5 finally the last section concludes the paper with the future direction of research 2 review of previous work over the last three decades much effort has been devoted to the design of biomimetic underwater vehicles the transfer of fish biological capabilities to engineered devices is a real challenge fish like biomimetic vehicles are practically useful but they do not represent complex behaviour characteristic of a real fish most of them implement only a few of the features of fish locomotion such as high propulsive efficiency and impeccable manoeuvrability sfakiotakis et al 1999 moreover low underwater acoustic noise is always a useful feature these advantages are very beneficial for potential applications such as aquatic life form observation oceanic supervision undersea environmental monitoring intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr mine detection military activities and so on in the case of underwater vehicles a bio inspired propulsion system provides better swimming performance at low speeds and quieter operation than traditional screw propellers fish 2013 to properly design a fish like underwater vehicle it is necessary to understand the interaction between the submerged moving vehicle and the surrounding incompressible and dense fluid when the fish moves its body and fins are in relation to the surrounding fluid the fluid is moved and reaction forces arise the main momentum transfer mechanisms are via drag lift and acceleration reaction forces the swimming drag consists of three components namely viscous or friction drag form drag and vortex shedding or induced drag sfakiotakis et al 1999 friction drag arises as a result of the viscosity of water in areas of flow with large velocity gradients form drag is caused by the distortion of flow around the fish s body and depends on its shape while induced drag depends largely on the shape of the fins the form and induced drag are collectively referred to as pressure drag the robotic fish hull is used to store onboard devices like drives batteries sensors and computers the hull must have a hydrodynamic shape in order to minimize drag force along the longitudinal axis of the vehicle reducing the drag of the hull is required to improve the endurance necessary in long distance underwater travel in order to achieve better energy utilization it is necessary to optimize the hull based on the correct drag estimation barrett et al 1999 the high vehicle hull transverse drag as well as the drag moment in the robot vertical axis on the other hand is beneficial as it helps to minimize unwanted oscillations and stabilizes the robot path anderson 2006 several papers can be found that deal with robotic fish hull drag estimation chan et al 2007 hyakudome et al 2011 mcletchie 2003 using experimental and numerical techniques the hull drag must be overcome by the thrust generated by the oscillating tail and fins estimation of this thrust may be a real challenge for the big vehicles cfd analysis may be one of the solutions in this case but robot fins must be modelled as rigid parts due to limitations of the simulation costa et al 2018b with small scale fish like robots or just their propulsion systems single fins the experimental setup can be fairly easily arranged in the small water tunnel costa et al 2018a the thrust generated by the oscillating tail and fins is then measured with different velocities of the surrounding water and the rigidity of fins is not required as in cfd analysis low et al 2010 an underwater robot is one of the most important pieces of ocean equipment and especially its stealth zhou 2016 low underwater acoustic noise is one of the basic requirements for bio inspired vehicles acoustic methods have been proved to be the most effective means for underwater target detection nie et al 2014 piskur and szymak 2017 the acoustic stealth of a submerged object has been an area of interest for many years sources of noise of a submarine are divided into propeller noise hydrodynamic noise and mechanical structure noise liu et al 2019 zhou 2016 hydrodynamic flow noise for small underwater vehicles is minimal if speed travel is less than 0 5 m s ferguson et al 2010 the paper tsukioka et al 2002 presents results of mechanical noise reduction in auv urashima in which reduction gear was changed from spur gear to helical one most research work concerning the study of underwater biomimetic vehicles is carried out for small sized vehicles the sizes of models described in the literature are up to tens of centimetres in length and with masses up to a few kilograms vehicles presented in the literature are usually small models built to study different aspects of biomimetic underwater robots like new propulsion mechanisms and fins materials mignano et al 2019 raj and thakur 2016 manoeuvrability li et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 control xie and du 2019 acoustic communication shatara and tan 2010 thrust mignano et al 2019 drag and added mass chan and kang 2011 gibouin et al 2018 the studied vehicles are not equipped with devices to make them useful for underwater work or little data about the equipment is given these papers provide valuable information about the above mentioned aspects of biomimetic vehicle operation however apart from the scientific interest paid to underwater biomimetic robotics the applicative issues also deserve attention thus the contribution of the paper is i the presentation of the biomimetic underwater vehicle designed built and equipped to execute isr tasks ii the measurement of the vehicle s velocity drag force and added mass iii the quantitative study of noise generated by the vehicle for two different types of installed drives the presented research is carried out for the fully functional vehicle able to work in outdoor water regions like lakes and seas 3 design and implementation of fish like vehicle the essential assumptions of bauv design were to i implement undulating propulsion which would act as silently as possible ii fit all the equipment necessary to perform isr tasks maintaining fish like shape of the hull iii keep the dimensions and weight as small as possible iv ensure that the vehicle would be able to dive down up to 40m the bauv hull design was inspired by the shape of a carp fish body mainly because it is laterally flattened and has a high ridge these shape features are desirable due to the convenience of the internal equipment arrangement the possibility to maintain big enough metacentric height and maintain the vehicle static stability are also important as the bauv was based on the carp its motion type can be characterized as subcarangiform but taking into consideration the length of the undulating part of the vehicle in comparison to the total length of the bauv it can be classified as carangiform because the length of its tail is almost one third of the total length of the vehicle in order to design the bauv hull external shape similar to a living fish a real carp body was scanned using romer omega r scan 3d scanner the obtained cloud of points was then imported into cad software and a digital 3d model of the fish body was generated fig 1 then the model of fish s body was scaled up to fulfil the requirements for the vehicle all the robot internal equipment such as drives drivetrains batteries power supply subsystem control computers and sensors were enclosed in the scaled up external fish like shape the majority of the hull elements are made out of pom polyoxymethylene some parts of the hull are aluminium to help with the internal heat dissipation and withstand excessive wear additional internal walls are added to reinforce the hull in the areas where large lateral surfaces are and in consequence higher stress due to water pressure occurs the entire hull was divided into 5 major sections section a the head section b the middle body section c the rear body section d the first tail segment section e the second tail segment additionally all major sections except section e were divided into three elements along the vehicle s longitudinal plane of symmetry in order to simplify the manufacturing process assembly of the internal devices and maintenance services thus each section of the hull and the first section of the tail is composed of the middle part and two symmetrical lids screwed on both sides of it all sections are connected in series with one another using screws located inside the hull there are o rings sealings placed between the lids and the middle part of each section as well as between sections two additional small lids are mounted to the first section s lids in places where pectoral fin shafts stick out of the hull these small lids cover pectoral fins drivetrains both the pectoral fins consist of a front rigid part and a rear elastic ending similarly each lid of section b is composed of two parts the bigger one is made of pom and the smaller one located in the lower part of the bigger one is made of aluminium which helps dissipate heat from the bauv interior additionally these aluminium lids cover battery compartment thus replacing robot batteries does not require removing the bigger lids of section b the last robot hull section second section of the tail is composed of two symmetrical hollow parts filled with buoyancy foam to achieve the proper trim of the vehicle an elastic caudal fin is mounted at the end of section e the bauv buoyancy is adjusted to be slightly positive by means of additional leaden weights distributed inside cavities in the streamlined beam attached underneath the hull this beam with additional weights is attached to the hull by an electromagnet and can be dropped in emergency situations causing the vehicle to emerge views of the bauv with its equipment are presented in fig 2 whereas the main parameters of the vehicle are presented in table 1 list of the vehicle s main equipment is presented in table 2 the bauv tail is driven by two maxon ec i servomotors whose oscillatory movements are properly synchronized to generate the undulating motion of the tail the first tail servomotor with an integrated planetary gearbox and encoder is located perpendicular to the vehicle s longitudinal axis inside section c and drives section d the first tail segment through additional belt transmission the second tail servomotor with an integrated planetary gearbox and encoder is placed parallel to the vehicle s longitudinal axis inside section d and drives section e the second tail segment through an additional bevel gear wires of the second servomotor are conducted through the hollow shaft of the first tail segment into section c where the tail servomotors controllers are placed each pectoral fin of the vehicle is driven by an independent maxon ec i servomotor with an integrated planetary gearbox and encoder through an additional belt transmission the pectoral fins servomotors controllers are located inside section a the bauv is also equipped with a cylindrical ballast tank whose inner volume can be precisely controlled by means of a moving piston lead screw belt transmission and servomotor with an integrated planetary gearbox and encoder all the components form the so called variable buoyancy system vbs which is located in the upper part of section b and is connected with a water inlet on the hull wall using an elastic hose the vbs drive controller is placed in section b all the servomotors controllers are daisy chained and connected to the common can bus which is used to exchange data with the robot control system located in section a an extra dc motor with a worm gear and custom made controller is used to erect or fold a movable mast on which the video camcorder and antennas are mounted the mast can be either folded or erected no in between position is possible while swimming the vehicle drives are executing motion according to the following formulas angular

pectoral fins mean value of oscillation a b is the speed of piston moving inside the cylinder of the vbs all the above parameters are controlled according to so called fish like motion patterns which are different for various robot tasks a more detailed description of motion of similar bauv can be found in the authors previous work morawski et al 2018 the vehicle control system is based on two pci104 computers the first one is responsible for low level control data acquisition from sensors and sensory data pre processing the second computer is responsible for high level control which guides the vehicle to autonomously move along the pre programmed path avoiding collisions with stationary obstacles in robot sensory system two types of sensors are used sensors responsible for providing navigational information and the robot s state belong to the first group the second type sensors are the ones used in mission execution sensors which provide navigational data and bauv state

the bottom side of section a measures the vehicle s velocity relative to surrounding water fibre optic gyro fog with integrated inertial measurement unit imu and global navigation satellite system

euler angles linear accelerations and angular rates in 3 axes absolute pressure sensor mounted in section a measures hydrostatic pressure and indirectly the vehicle s depth three leak sensors mounted at the inner bottom part of sections a b and c provide information about potential hull leaks battery management system integrated with battery packs measures the state of charge voltage current drawn from each battery and estimates time to system shutdown due to low battery voltage mission specific sensors are high resolution camcorder mounted on the erectable mast which is capable of registering either underwater or above surface video images depending on the position of the mast mechanical scanning sonar mounted in front of the vehicle used to register images of underwater infrastructure as well as detect obstacles on the bauv s path side scan sonar with two transducers mounted on both sides of the lower part of section b used to register images of the seafloor communication with the vehicle is carried out using one of three wireless channels a 2 4 ghz radio link or 868mhz radio modem when the vehicle is emerged and an acoustic modem underwater the communication subsystem dynamically switches the channel based on the quality of the signal to achieve the highest possible data rate communication with the bauv can be also established using tether but this feature was added only for testing purposes in the swimming pool tether is detachable from the vehicle by means of a watertight junction located on the upper side of section b antennas for radio communication are mounted on top of the erectable mast whereas the acoustic modem s spherical transceiver is placed on top of section b near two sockets for battery charging and tether connection the view of the bauv during tests in the baltic sea is presented in fig 3 4 study of the drag in order to estimate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the bauv the authors measured the drag coefficient of the hull and added the mass of neighbouring water when the vehicle was pulled with constant force along a straight line in the swimming pool in those tests the tail undulation and pectoral fins oscillations were turned off in order to measure the hull drag only the test stand utilizing a six axis force and moments sensor hoisting winch driven by a brushless direct current motor with an incremental encoder and planetary gearhead motor controller stainless steel frame system of pulleys and steel string was constructed for this purpose in the arrangement presented in fig 4 the winding drum with a 2 mm thick steel string was attached to the output shaft of the planetary gearhead integrated with the bldc maxon ec i40 100w motor powered by a dedicated maxon epos 50 5 bldc motor controller the reduction ratio of the gearhead was 1 21 the motor was attached to the one side of the ft axia 80 force sensor with range of 200 n the other side of the force sensor was attached to the base of the hoisting winch which was fixed to the side of the swimming pool the motor controller was connected to the laptop computer via usb interface in order to set motion parameters and register the actual moving speed of the motor the force sensor was also connected to the computer via the ethernet connection thus the forces were measured in real time the force sensor measured forces in three axes of the cartesian reference frame additionally the sensor measured moments of forces around those axes the free end of the steel string was attached to the bauv through a pulley the pulley was attached to the stainless steel frame submerged in the pool and immobilized at the bottom by additional weights the bauv was submerged at the same depth approximately 1m as the pulley in the experiment the bauv was pulled horizontally with a constant force achieved by the winch motor which was powered in constant current constant torque mode by the motor controller the speed of the bauv was calculated based on measurements of motor speed and geometry of the pulley system the friction force of the pulley was estimated in the laboratory with the same arrangement of the test stand as in the swimming pool using the experimental setup presented above the vehicle s motion along the pulling direction can be described by equation 4 1 derived from second newton s law with quadratic drag force this mathematical

tanh c d ρ a 2 f f e m r t bauv maximum velocity is v m 2 f e c d ρ a a time offset value t 0 should be added in equation 4 4 because in the experiment the starting moment of bauv was not synchronized

5 best fits the experimental data using the least squares method then using 4 2 added mass m a was calculated in equation 4 1 the drag was modelled by a single drag coefficient c d which includes all the drag components along the pulling direction in the experiment the bauv was pulled forward with four set values of the motor current i 1 a 1 2 a 1 5 a 2 a which in consequence gave four values of the motor torque the motor current was stabilized by the motor controller with the pi algorithm current controller parameters were tuned beforehand thus a constant stabilized pulling force was achieved which was measured by the force sensor bauv speed and pulling force measurements were repeated three times for a given set current of the motor selected averaged results are presented in table 3 the bauv velocities obtained from expression 4 5 with t 0 0 for data presented in table 3 are shown in fig 5 the range of maximal vehicle velocities obtained in the experiment is typical for the bauv during mission execution thus calculated c d and m a values are practically useful in estimation of motion parameters by odometric navigation subsystem of the vehicle graphs presented in fig 6 depict measured speeds of the bauv with fitted curves for three repetitions of the second trial second row of table 3 there can be seen oscillations of bauv measured velocity around its maximal value which can be caused by the tension of the pulling string when the pulling force is almost equal to drag force estimated parameters and curve fitting index for the data presented in fig 6 are given in table 4 a similar experimental setup was used to measure speed changes when the vehicle was pulled sideways in this case the bauv cross section was a 0 572 m 2 the experiment showed that with similar effective forces acting on the hull as in the forward pulling direction the vehicle velocities are from 19 to 21 of those obtained for forward pulling direction which corresponds to the change in the vehicle s cross section drag coefficients are four to five times higher for effective pulling force f e 8 6 n the vehicle s maximal velocity was 0 124 m s the drag coefficient was 1 94 and added mass was 181 3 k g 5 noise study to drive the biomimetic propulsion system tail pectoral fins and vbs bldc maxon motors ec i series integrated with planetary gearboxes were used to check the influence of vehicle design on the generated noise two types of gearboxes were used standard and with reduced backlash the noise was measured for the vehicle being held in place in a laboratory pool of the size of 5 1 2 6 1 m3 length x width x depth the hydrophone was located in front of the vehicle at a distance of 1 3 m and depth of 0 4 m the vehicle was submerged at the same depth as the hydrophone to measure the noise generated by the vehicle hti 96 min hydrophone was used the gain of the hydrophone is k d b 169 7 d b with reference gain k r e f 1 v μ p a thus after recalculation the gain is k 3 27 m v p a to register sound pressure level spl crio 9024 system with n9215 voltage input module and a custom built software application were used spl signal after removal of the dc component registered for the vehicle equipped with standard gearboxes and with tail motion only is presented in fig 7 during this measurement the tail was working with the following parameters a t 1 0 38 r a d ϕ t 1 0 94 r a d a t 2 1 03 r a d ϕ t 2 4 52 r a d and f t 0 8 h z for the presented example rms value of spl equals to p r m s 2 2 10 6 μ p a what is p d b 127 d b with reference pressure equal to 1 μ p a the peaks of the signal which occur five times per second result from mechanical scanning sonar operation additional peaks taking place every 1 25 s correspond to the tail s oscillation frequency which is 0 8 hz and result from the gearbox backlash the graph of obtained spl after replacement of standard gearboxes with the ones with reduced backlash and the same motion parameters is shown in fig 8 in this case rms value of spl is lowered to p r m s 1 3 10 6 μ p a that is p d b 122 d b noise measurements for tail pectoral fins and vbs working separately were carried out in the experiment motion parameters and spl measured before and after the replacement of standard gearboxes with ones with reduced backlash are presented in table 5 the mean value of background noise was 119 0 db comparison of noise generated by variable buoyancy system with standard and reduced backlash gearboxes is presented below fig 9 and fig 10 the measurement shows significant noise reduction especially in the frequency range from 1 to 4 khz 6 conclusions in this paper the design of fully functional biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicle built for performing intelligence surveillance reconnaissance was presented the vehicle can also be used as a member of a cooperative system of multiple similar fish like robots or the leader for a system of less equipped fish like robots bauv sensors control units drives batteries required to execute a mission determine the vehicle s dimensions all the vehicle equipment is enclosed in the fish like hull to provide maximal similarity to a real life fish one of the important features which influences the effectiveness of the undulating propulsion is the shape of the hull of the underwater vehicle so the robot s hull was developed based on bioinspiration by the application of a scaled up shape of carp fish body which should result in a low drag force for such a real structure experimental studies of selected parameters were carried out when it comes to control of the vehicle during its operation parameters of its dynamic model are used vehicle velocity in time for constant pulling force was registered in the research measured terminal velocities together with pulling forces allowed for calculating drag coefficients for two directions of pulling of the vehicle forward and sideways assuming drag force to be proportional to the velocity squared based on analytical solution added masses were found out due to limited accuracy of measuring speed in vertical direction drag coefficients and added masses were calculated for forward and sideways pulling directions only this issue is going to be addressed in future work the results show that added mass and drag coefficient decrease with increasing vehicle velocity obtained the drag coefficient c d values from 0 45 to 0 61 are smaller than those from the literature 0 70 0 75 chan et al 2007 chan and kang 2011 it proves that proposed implementation of real fish shape in the design of the bauv gives good results a more thorough investigation is required since to solve motion differential equation following other researchers approach the drag coefficient and added mass values were assumed to be independent of the vehicle motion parameters added masses obtained in the experiment 46 8 kg 85 0 kg are much higher than those in the reference literature chan et al 2007 chan and kang 2011 but since they depend on the size shape and motion parameters of the vehicle cannot be compared directly to address this subject more research is required the authors plan further experiments with the use of higher accuracy speed measurement system in the experiment the bauv biomimetic propulsion was turned off to measure dynamic parameters of the hull only the thrust generated by biomimetic propulsion and its influence on the vehicle dynamic will be addressed in the future work for isr tasks for which the vehicle is designed low acoustic profile is required thus the presented research includes measurements of noise generated by the vehicle to assess the influence of the mechanical structure on the noise level two types of drives were checked the first with standard and the second with reduced backlash gearboxes the generated noise was reduced by 7 db in average 9 db for variable buoyancy system drives 8 db for the tail drives 5 db for the pectoral fins the mechanical scanning sonar installed in front of the vehicle generates significant peaks in the acoustic signals but it is not essential to mission execution thus when the low noise mode of operation is required the sonar should be turned off in specific situations most of the biomimetic vehicles described in the subject literature are small scaled physical models designed to execute laboratory tests thus obtained results of noise and drag cannot be applied to full scale vehicles the research presented in the paper is executed for a fully functional vehicle and therefore the results can be used as input parameters for autonomous control system during mission execution the results are an essential contribution to the established parameters of a dynamic model of a functional vehicle for linear motion and they allow finding i vehicle response to a change of thrust force ii how much time is required to change vehicle speed by defined amount iii maximum velocity for a given thrust iv required mechanical power to operate at a given speed quantitative results of drag and noise obtained in the research may be useful for designers of mechanical structures of full scale biomimetic underwater robots and their control subsystems based on the above summary the future work will include measurements of the vehicle s hull drag coefficient and added mass in the vertical direction comparison of the measured drag coefficients and added masses with the results of cfd analysis the study of the influence of the buv s hull oscillations on the drag coefficients and added masses while the vehicle is propelled by the tail and pectoral fins funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or

21393,a slug flow a series of liquid slug separated by a gas pocket is a flow pattern that often occurs in a multiphase oil and gas riser system dynamic and structural responses of a riser can be increased by time varying forces of the slug flow in this paper a methodology has been developed for the evaluation of the effects of slug flow on the dynamic and structural responses of different types of risers a global dynamic analysis is carried out to calculate the dynamic responses of a riser induced by the slug flow and environmental loads idealized regular slug flow are considered as a time dependent variation of internal fluid flow according to results of multiphase flow simulations local stress and fatigue damage of risers are estimated using an in house program which considered the hysteresis effects of a flexible riser the verifications of the numerical model and slug modeling method are carried out prior to the parametric study parametric studies are performed in order to quantitatively identify the design conditions that are most affected by the slug flow the riser system connected to a moored vessel in deep water is considered for the parametric study different riser materials riser configurations production stages flow rates and environmental conditions are considered study results demonstrate that the dynamic effects due to slug flow are significant for a flexible lazy wave riser middle production stage and mild sea states while the maximum value of dynamic loads is slightly changed even with considerable slug flow range of fluctuation standard deviation of bending curvature is substantially increased under mild sea states with high probability of occurrence this means that a main impact of the slug flow is the increased fatigue damage of a riser structure the fatigue damage with and without slug flow has been estimated in order to investigate the fatigue contribution of the slug flow keywords riser slug flow global dynamic analysis fatigue damage parametric study 1 introduction risers are a principal device for the offshore oil and gas production systems a main objective of the riser is to transport produced fluid from subsea wells to an offshore platform as shown in fig 1 a different riser configuration is installed in accordance with site specific environmental conditions and characteristics of a platform dnv gl 2018 offshore risers are exposed to different loads which should be predicted properly in order to determine design loads and dynamic responses the loads can be categorized into four groups as follow dnv gl 2018 pressure loads functional loads environmental loads accidental loads environmental loads such as wave current and floater motions are generally main parameters to be taken into account in the riser design in case of compliant type risers slug flow may cause substantial dynamic load effects slug flow a series of liquid slug separated by a gas pocket is a flow pattern that often occurs in the multiphase riser system as illustrated in fig 2 the dynamic loads of slug flow include contributions from weight and pressure variations centrifugal and coriolis forces a main impact of slug is the increased fatigue damage of a riser with high curvature area gundersen et al 2012 international standards and specifications recommend that the possible effects of slug flow should be considered in the design of deepwater compliant risers iso 2006 however there is no practical guidance or methodology to assess the effects of slug flow there is also little information on the quantitative effect of the slug flow on the dynamic and structural responses of risers a great deal of study has been carried out on the dynamic and structural analysis of the riser tahar and kim 2003 for example developed a computer program for hull mooring riser coupled dynamic analysis of a turret moored vessel in waves winds and currents the numerical results were compared with wave basin experiments and the overall comparisons for vessel motions and mooring riser tensions were reasonable kim and kim 2015 conducted study on dynamic behaviors of conventional steel catenary risers and lazy wave steel catenary risers for an offshore platform in deepwater they investigated the dynamic and structural responses of two riser configurations using a fully coupled analysis in case of a flexible riser the mechanical behavior is a highly nonlinear problem due to multi layered cross section much research into the dynamic and structural analysis of the flexible riser has been carried out using analytical numerical and experimental methods sævik 2011 yoo et al 2017 kim et al 2018 most of the previous studies have mainly considered external loads caused by environmental loads recently several researches have been made on the effect of internal flow fylling et al 1988 carried out a quasi static analysis for the calculation of loads from internal fluid flow an approximate solution was developed for a slug flow which travels through a flexible pipe at constant speed fylling et al 1995 analyzed the dynamics of pipe with a simple dynamic model of prescribed slug flow the mass matrix was updated according to the slug position at every time step and forces induced by the slug flow were added to the dynamic equilibrium equation gundersen et al 2012 developed an analysis methodology to determine the remnant fatigue life of flexible risers subjected to simple slug flow and wave loads they demonstrated that the fatigue life of a flexible riser is decreased due to the effects of slug flow ortega et al 2017 developed two coupled in house codes to identify and quantify the effects of slug flow and regular wave loads on the dynamic responses of a flexible riser onuoha et al 2018 presented an improvised coupling technique for stress impact and dynamic response studies of a flowline riser system exposed to cyclic loadings resulting from severe slug flow the study involved partial coupling of transient multiphase flow simulator olga and structural finite element code abaqus from the above literature review results many studies have treated the dynamic and structural analysis of risers due to environmental loads regarding the effects of slug flow several studies have focused on the numerical methods to consider the slug flow in the riser dynamic analysis it has also been investigated how the dynamic and structural responses of the riser are affected by the slug flow under limited conditions however little literature has treated how the effect differs quantitatively depending on the characteristics of risers and the slug flow in this paper a procedure to analyze the dynamic and structural response of the riser is established in consideration of environmental load and slug flow through a series of parametric studies the effects of slug flow on risers are quantitatively compared to find out what conditions the slug flow is the most affective to accurately evaluate the effects of slug flow a fully coupled global dynamic analysis of vessel mooring riser system is required considering not only slug flow but also wave wind and current in this study a methodology has been developed for an evaluation of the effects of slug flow on the dynamic responses and fatigue damages of risers a coupled time domain analysis program is used to calculate the dynamic responses of a riser induced by slug induced loads and environmental loads cyclic regular slug flows are assumed in the analysis as a time dependent variation of internal fluid density a multiphase flow simulation program is used to calculate the precise slug parameters for subsea production conditions local stress and fatigue damage of risers are estimated using an in house code developed to consider the hysteresis effects of a flexible riser a series of parametric studies are performed in order to identify what conditions the effect of slug flow becomes significant the following parameters are taken into account riser types steel and flexible types riser configurations catenary and lazy wave production stages flow rates early middle late stages environment mild and extremes sea states a riser system connected to a moored vessel in deep water is considered for the quantitative evaluation the dynamic responses and resultant fatigue damages for critical conditions are calculated for two cases with and without slug flow the contribution of the slug flow is identified by the comparison of the two 2 analysis methodology and mathematical models 2 1 description of

calculation conditions 3 1 description of vessel mooring riser system the global dynamic analysis model in this study consists of a vessel mooring lines and a riser the vessel is a ship shaped floating production storage and offloading fpso moored in 1829 m water depth by semi taut lines with a turret one production riser for each case is assumed for a study purpose the specifications of vessel mooring riser system are obtained from the previous study by kim and kim 2015 the main particulars and loading condition data of the fpso are given in table 1 the discretized hull panel model is presented in fig 9 the mooring system consists of twelve chain polyester rope chain lines in three bundles of four lines the angle between bundles is 90 deg and the angle between lines in each bundle is 5 deg four different riser types are considered in order to compare dynamic and structural behaviors the specifications of mooring and riser are summarized in table 2 and table 3 the static configurations of the risers are presented in fig 10 and each type shows almost the same results regardless of the riser material fig 11 shows the modeling of the fpso mooring riser system for the global dynamic analysis 3 2 description of environmental conditions the environmental conditions of the gulf of mexico are considered for the parametric study table 4 presents the summary of environmental data iso 2005 irregular wave sea states and wind speeds are calculated by jonswap with gamma of 2 4 and npd spectrum wind speeds of 1 h average values and constant current speeds are assumed in the simulation as shown in fig 12 the incident heading angles of wave wind and current are 180 150 and 145 deg respectively the sea states for the fatigue damage estimation as presented in table 5 cheng and cao 2013 h s t p v w and v c in the table are significant wave height peak wave period 1 h average wind speed and constant current speed respectively the spectral characteristics of wave and wind are the same as those for the parametric study collinear all heading angles 180 deg and non collinear fig 12 heading combinations are considered for the calculation 3 3 description of hydrocarbon production the multiphase flow simulation is performed in order to obtain the characteristics of slug flow normal black oil is considered as internal fluid of the riser the hydrocarbon fluid compositions and production rates are summarized in table 6 and table 7 table 8 presents the thermal material properties of risers for the estimation of heat transfer between riser and seawater 4 results and discussion 4 1 verification of numerical model verifications of numerical models and local stress calculation are carried out prior to the parametric study on the effects of slug flow for the verification numerical simulations are performed for the same calculation conditions as the published literatures and results are compared kim and kim 2015 skeie et al 2012 the global dynamic analysis of the vessel mooring riser system has been carried out for 100 year return period environmental condition used in the reference literature the same specifications of the fpso mooring lines and riser as the reference are used the comparison results of the stress responses for the steel lazy wave riser are shown in fig 13 and fig 14 the solid lines and symbols are the results of the present study and reference literature respectively the two results are almost similar and the slight difference is thought to be due to the effect of random seeds of the irregular environmental loads and minor modeling parameters an in house numerical code has been developed to evaluate the local stress of tensile armor of flexible riser hysteresis curves for the 6 inch flexible riser considered in the reference literature are calculated for the verification of the in house code an axial force of 1000 kn and a friction coefficient of 0 2 are considered for the analysis as described in the reference as shown in fig 15 the hysteresis curve of the present study show a good agreement with that of the reference as the results of verification it can be confirmed that reasonable results can be obtained through the numerical models of this paper 4 2 verification of on slug modeling in this paper the slug flow in the risers are idealized as the regular slug flow for the global dynamic analysis the constant period and amplitude of the mass flow rate are assumed as the average value of long term irregular slug flow by the flow simulation the verification of slug modeling method is carried out to confirm that the regular slug modeling is suitable for the quantitative evaluation of the effects of slug flow the flexible lazy wave riser is considered in the verification work three representative flow cases from the multiphase flow simulations are considered in the study the fatigue damages with different slug modeling methods are compared fig 16 shows the original mass flow rates at sag bend of the flexible lazy wave riser and two types of modeling results the green dotted line is time series of original mass flow rate calculated from the flow simulation and the blue solid line is the reference modelling considering the period and amplitude of the individual slug flow which is expected to have nearly the same effect as the original mass flow the red solid line is the result of the modeling that is regularized using the average value of the entire duration in accordance with the method described in section 2 2 case 1 has the highest mass flow rate and has almost regular flow characteristics in contrast case 3 has the lowest mass flow rate and high irregular characteristics case 2 has intermediate characteristics between case 1 and case 3 as shown in fig 17 the spectral density of the reference modeling is almost identical to the result of the original flow rate in case of regular slug modeling the spectral density responses are concentrated at specific peak frequencies fig 18 and fig 19 show the comparison results of the local stress response and the annual fatigue damage of the inner tensile armor at sag bend for different modeling methods only the dynamic and structural responses of the riser due to the slug flow are calculated not including environmental loads the annual fatigue damages are estimated using s n curve for base material of high strength steel sousa et al 2012 more detailed description about parameters for the fatigue damage calculation is presented in the following section 4 8 differences of the annual fatigue damage between the reference and regular slug modeling are not significant for all three cases from the results of the study the regular slug modeling seems to be a suitable method for the efficient evaluation of the slug effects it should be noted that the use of regular slug modelling may not be appropriated if the characteristics of internal flow vary significantly due to the changes in well production or various subsea operations 4 3 calculation conditions for parametric study parametric studies are performed for comparison of the effects of slug flow cases of the parametric studies are presented in table 9 as an initial screening the global dynamic analysis is carried out for all riser types with an arbitrary slug flow according to the results riser types showing considerable slug are selected and then detailed parametric studies are performed for various production stages and environmental conditions 4 4 motion responses of vessel the motion responses of the fpso are calculated by the global dynamic analysis in time domain fig 20 shows some part of motion time traces of the fpso the steel catenary riser scr and steel lazy wave riser slwr without slug flow are considered in the example the motion responses show a typical tendency for a ship shaped vessel in case of the horizontal motions such as surge sway and yaw low frequency responses appear due to wave drift wind and current forces since the first order wave exciting forces are dominant factors of the vertical motions the response shows wave frequency responses it is found that the riser type has an insignificant effect on the motion responses of the fpso the riser induced forces are much smaller than environment and mooring induced forces the motion responses are therefore almost identical for all parametric studies 4 5 results of initial screening analysis the effects of slug flow with respect to different riser types are initially compared for an arbitrary slug flow as shown in fig 21 the characteristics of slug flow used in the initial screening analysis are presented in table 10 the dynamic responses of the risers considering the arbitrary slug flow are compared to the results with internal flow velocity of 0 m s table 11 shows the comparison results of effective tension and bending curvature along riser arc length the max response indicates the maximum value during simulation and the std dev response indicates the maximum value of standard deviations along the riser response differences are not significant for the maximum values the main reason is that the maximum results are greatly influenced by the identical vessel induced loads the slug flow has also little effect on the catenary shaped riser in case of the lazy wave configuration standard deviations of bending curvatures increase more than three times due to the slug flow this difference is due to the static configurations of each riser shape the maximum static curvatures for the catenary and lazy wave shape are 0 002 and 0 008 rad m respectively a high curvature produces greater centrifugal forces from the internal slug flow and the lazy wave configuration is more sensitive to the slug flow thus detailed parametric studies are performed for the steel lazy wave riser slwr and the flexible lazy wave riser flwr fig 22 presents standard deviation values for the bending curvature of the steel lazy wave riser the effects due to slug flow are most pronounced in zones of high curvature e g hog bend sag bend and touch down area the change of centrifugal force due to the slug flow in high curvature zones is dominant factor to increase the variation of bending curvature responses from the results the high curvature zone especially the sag bend needs to be focused in detailed parametric studies 4 6 results of multiphase flow simulation the characteristics of slug flow are calculated by the multiphase flow simulation during 10 h based on the initial screening steel and flexible lazy wave risers are considered in the simulation mass flow rates at sag bend of the steel lazy wave riser are presented in fig 23 it is noted that fluctuations of the flow rates are high frequency components with a period less than 120 s low frequency components are not considered in the detailed parametric studies because a severe slug with long period would be mitigated for the stable topside production in case of the early stage with high production rate the internal flow shows constant tendency due to high flow velocity the mass flow rates are fluctuated periodically in the middle and late stages as the production rates decrease idealized regular mass flow rates are needed for the application to the global dynamic analysis the mass flow rates for each production stage are idealized as shown in fig 24 the effects of the slug flow are expected to be well maintained because peak frequencies of the original and idealized flow are in good agreement as shown in fig 25 because the idealized flow has regular flow rate and period spectral densities of the idealized flow are more concentrated table 12 presents the summarized characteristics of slug flow applied to the detailed parametric studies the slug flow of the middle stage has higher flow velocity and longer slug length these results are due to the fact that the production rate of middle stage is almost twice that of the late stage the difference in heat transfer and roughness between the steel and flexible riser makes the composition of the multiphase flow different and the flow characteristics are slightly different 4 7 results of detailed parametric study the results of detailed parametric studies are described in this section the effective tension and bending curvature acting on the riser are calculated by the global dynamic analysis the dynamic responses considering specific slug flow are compared to the results with equivalent steady flow fig 26 and fig 27 show standard deviations of the effective tension and bending curvature for the flexible lazy wave riser the 1 year return period environmental condition and slug flow of the middle stage are applied to this calculation while the effective tension responses with the slug flow are almost similar to those of the steady flow case the bending curvature responses are significantly increased by slug effects especially in high curvature zones the responses of effective tension are greatly affected by environmental loads and weight variations of the entire lower rise section which are almost the same regardless of the internal flow characteristics the fluctuation standard deviation of the bending curvature is increased by the slug flow because it is affected by the local weight distribution and the centrifugal force of the internal slug flow fig 28 depicts spectral density of the bending curvature responses at sag bend the peak frequency of the wave spectrum and the slug frequency are 0 10 hz and 0 04 hz respectively the maximum value of response spectrum is calculated at 0 04 hz for the slug flow case it is evident that slug flow has significant impacts on the responses of bending curvature fig 29 shows time traces of bending curvature at sag bend under various environmental conditions the flexible lazy wave riser with slug flow of the middle stage is considered in these calculations it is found that slug flow dominates the dynamic response of bending curvature under mild sea state for the steady flow case under the mild sea state the response fluctuation is almost negligible due to small environmental loads and motion isolation effects the slug flow generates a relatively large dynamic force which increases the response fluctuation in the mild environment as the environmental conditions become severer the slug flow induced force is similar but the environmental loads increase in the case of 100 year return period condition the responses for the steady and slug flow show negligible difference the summarized results of parametric studies are presented in table 13 and table 14 the standard deviations of bending curvature at sag bend are directly compared with regard to the internal flow the main parameters of the studies are production stages flow rates and environmental conditions as presented in table 9 according to the results the flexible lazy wave riser is more sensitive to the slug flow because the bending stiffness of the flexible riser is much smaller than that of the steel riser the response differences of the flexible riser are calculated larger under similar conditions as shown in table 13 and fig 30 the differences between the results are influenced by the production stage the flow rates that vary depending on the production stage make the characteristics of slug flow different the faster flow velocity and longer slug length of the middle production stage generate larger slug induced dynamic loads as a result the effects of slug flow for the middle stage are higher than those for the late stage it means that adequate estimation of slugging parameters is required over the expected service life the results regarding the environmental conditions indicate that the slug flow under mild sea state has more substantial impacts on the riser loads as shown in table 14 and fig 31 since the effects of slug flow are much greater in the mild condition with high probability of occurrence the slug flow can be expected to have a significant influence on the fatigue damage of a riser structure 4 8 results of fatigue damage calculation the results of parametric studies demonstrate that the dynamic effects due to slug flow are significant for flexible riser lazy wave configuration and mild environmental conditions the range of fluctuation standard deviation of bending curvature increases substantially under mild sea state this means that a principal impact of the slug flow on the riser is the increase in fatigue damage the fatigue damage with and without slug flow are estimated for the steel and flexible lazy wave riser the calculation conditions for the fatigue damage estimation are presented in table 15 the rainflow counting method is used for the damage estimation dnv d curve for welds in pipelines and s n curve for base material of high strength steel are used for the steel and flexible lazy wave riser respectively dnv gl 2017 sousa et al 2012 the stress concentration factor of 1 25 is considered for the steel lazy wave riser the mean stress correction is included in the fatigue damage calculation of the flexible lazy wave riser the thickness effect is not taken into account because the thickness values of risers are smaller than the reference thickness the environmental conditions are summarized in table 5 all 280 load cases are considered for the global dynamic analysis in time domain the stress time series are derived for the dynamic responses during 3 h simulation two specific points are considered to investigate the effects of slug flow on the fatigue damage as shown in fig 32 the outermost radial position and inner tensile armor are selected for the steel lazy wave riser and flexible lazy wave riser respectively in case of the flexible lazy wave riser curvature stress hysteresis curves are considered for the calculation of the local stress of inner tensile armor the hysteresis curve depends on material specifications and the internal and external pressure of the riser fig 33 shows the hysteresis curves at the sag bend location for the internal pressure of the middle production stage the local stress responses are calculated using these hysteresis curve as shown in fig 34 examples of stress histogram for the steady and slug flow condition are presented in fig 35 the middle production stage and collinear environmental heading combination are assumed in the examples the environmental condition no 3 and no 12 represent mild and harsh conditions respectively it is noted that the number of cycles are displayed only up to 600 cycles in fig 35 when the internal flow is steady under the mild environmental condition the maximum stress range is less than 1 0 mpa for both riser types considering the slug flow the maximum stress range of the steel and flexible lazy wave riser are 3 5 and 7 8 mpa respectively in case of the harsh environmental condition the increase rate of the maximum stress range due to slug flow is lower than the mild environmental condition the effects of slug flow on the fatigue damage become more significant for the mild sea state and the flexible lazy wave riser these results show a good agreement with those predicted in the detailed parametric studies the annual fatigue damages for the 14 environmental conditions are presented in fig 36 the estimation results show a similar trend between the steel and flexible lazy wave riser in case of the mild sea states environmental conditions of lower number the fatigue damages vary greatly depending on whether the slug flow is included or not it means that the slug induced fatigue damages are much greater than environmental loads induced damages for the mild sea states the effects of slug flow are not significant for the harsh sea states because of large environmental loads in the absence of slug flow the environment induced fatigue damages for the mild sea states are negligible thus the damages are calculated to be smaller than those for the harsh sea states even if the probability of occurrence for the mild sea state is high since the fluctuations of stress due to the slug flow are significant in the mild sea states the fatigue damages with slug flow are larger than those for the harsh sea states because of their high probability of occurrence the summarized annual fatigue damage with and without slug flow are presented in table 16 a factor of safety of 10 is considered for the calculation of fatigue life it is noted that the slug flow is not considered in the early production stage according to the results of multiphase flow analysis the estimation results show significant fatigue contributions of slug flow the fatigue damage with slug flow case 2 is much greater than that with steady flow case 1 especially for the flexible lazy wave riser in case of the flexible riser the fatigue damage increases by about 1000 times if it includes the slug flow the effects of slug flow on the fatigue are sensitive to the slug flow characteristics for each production stage this is because the stress range is different as the velocity and length of slug flow are changed it means that appropriate estimation of the slugging parameters is required taking into account the riser types and the production flow characteristics the fatigue lives in this study are evaluated longer than normal service life of risers even considering the slug flow however the effects of slug flow should be sufficiently taken into account in the riser design where there is not enough margin for the fatigue life because the fatigue damage can be significantly increased due to the slug flow 5 conclusions in this study the effects of slug flow on the dynamic responses and fatigue damage of risers were estimated by using the global dynamic analysis the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave loads of the fpso were computed by the hydrodynamic analysis the characteristics of slug flow for each riser and production stage were obtained from the multiphase flow simulation parametric studies were performed considering different calculation conditions in order to investigate the effects of slug flow the fatigue damages with and without slug flow were compared for the estimation of the fatigue contribution of slug flow from the results of studies the following conclusions can be drawn the dynamic loads induced by slug flow consist of weight variations centrifugal and coriolis forces the effective tension and the maximum bending curvature responses are almost unaffected by the slug induced loads the standard deviations response fluctuations of bending curvature are significantly increased by the slug flow the verifications of the numerical model and slug modeling method have been carried out prior to the parametric study the numerical simulation model for the global dynamic analysis and in house code for the local stress calculation of the flexible riser are verified by comparing the results with reference literatures according to the verification result of the slug modeling method the regular slug modeling seems to be a suitable method for the estimation of the effects of slug flow the results of the parametric studies demonstrate that the effects of slug flow are most pronounced in areas along the lazy wave riser with high curvature zones e g hog and sag bend and touch down area the most critical production stage is a middle stage where the flow rate is half of the maximum value the slug flow has more substantial impact on a flexible riser due to its lower value of bending stiffness since the environmental loads are small the effects of slug flow under mild sea states dominate the dynamic responses of riser according to the results of the parametric studies the variations of bending curvature are increased by the slug flow especially under mild sea states with high probability of occurrence it means that a main impact of the slug flow is the increased fatigue damage of a riser structure the fatigue damages with and without slug flow have been estimated in order to investigate the fatigue contributions of slug flow the stress ranges for the mild sea states are greatly increased by the slug flow the dynamic responses and fatigue damage of risers are sensitive to the characteristics of riser system and slug flow the standard deviations of bending curvature and stress range are different as the velocity and length of slug flow are changed this means that appropriate estimation of slugging parameters is required over the expected service life through the above study results the slug flow inside the riser definitely affects the fatigue life of the riser the effect of slug flow at the sag bend position of the flexible lazy wave riser is found significant at the design stage of the riser the need for further evaluation of the slug effects may be low if the fatigue life at sag bend without the slug flow is sufficiently longer than the normal service life the effects of slug flow should be taken into account in the riser design where there is not enough margin for fatigue life of the riser for the risers covered in this paper the fatigue damage increases from 100 to 1000 times due to the slug induced load credit authorship contribution statement hyeonsu jeong conceptualization methodology software

21393,a slug flow a series of liquid slug separated by a gas pocket is a flow pattern that often occurs in a multiphase oil and gas riser system dynamic and structural responses of a riser can be increased by time varying forces of the slug flow in this paper a methodology has been developed for the evaluation of the effects of slug flow on the dynamic and structural responses of different types of risers a global dynamic analysis is carried out to calculate the dynamic responses of a riser induced by the slug flow and environmental loads idealized regular slug flow are considered as a time dependent variation of internal fluid flow according to results of multiphase flow simulations local stress and fatigue damage of risers are estimated using an in house program which considered the hysteresis effects of a flexible riser the verifications of the numerical model and slug modeling method are carried out prior to the parametric study parametric studies are performed in order to quantitatively identify the design conditions that are most affected by the slug flow the riser system connected to a moored vessel in deep water is considered for the parametric study different riser materials riser configurations production stages flow rates and environmental conditions are considered study results demonstrate that the dynamic effects due to slug flow are significant for a flexible lazy wave riser middle production stage and mild sea states while the maximum value of dynamic loads is slightly changed even with considerable slug flow range of fluctuation standard deviation of bending curvature is substantially increased under mild sea states with high probability of occurrence this means that a main impact of the slug flow is the increased fatigue damage of a riser structure the fatigue damage with and without slug flow has been estimated in order to investigate the fatigue contribution of the slug flow keywords riser slug flow global dynamic analysis fatigue damage parametric study 1 introduction risers are a principal device for the offshore oil and gas production systems a main objective of the riser is to transport produced fluid from subsea wells to an offshore platform as shown in fig 1 a different riser configuration is installed in accordance with site specific environmental conditions and characteristics of a platform dnv gl 2018 offshore risers are exposed to different loads which should be predicted properly in order to determine design loads and dynamic responses the loads can be categorized into four groups as follow dnv gl 2018 pressure loads functional loads environmental loads accidental loads environmental loads such as wave current and floater motions are generally main parameters to be taken into account in the riser design in case of compliant type risers slug flow may cause substantial dynamic load effects slug flow a series of liquid slug separated by a gas pocket is a flow pattern that often occurs in the multiphase riser system as illustrated in fig 2 the dynamic loads of slug flow include contributions from weight and pressure variations centrifugal and coriolis forces a main impact of slug is the increased fatigue damage of a riser with high curvature area gundersen et al 2012 international standards and specifications recommend that the possible effects of slug flow should be considered in the design of deepwater compliant risers iso 2006 however there is no practical guidance or methodology to assess the effects of slug flow there is also little information on the quantitative effect of the slug flow on the dynamic and structural responses of risers a great deal of study has been carried out on the dynamic and structural analysis of the riser tahar and kim 2003 for example developed a computer program for hull mooring riser coupled dynamic analysis of a turret moored vessel in waves winds and currents the numerical results were compared with wave basin experiments and the overall comparisons for vessel motions and mooring riser tensions were reasonable kim and kim 2015 conducted study on dynamic behaviors of conventional steel catenary risers and lazy wave steel catenary risers for an offshore platform in deepwater they investigated the dynamic and structural responses of two riser configurations using a fully coupled analysis in case of a flexible riser the mechanical behavior is a highly nonlinear problem due to multi layered cross section much research into the dynamic and structural analysis of the flexible riser has been carried out using analytical numerical and experimental methods sævik 2011 yoo et al 2017 kim et al 2018 most of the previous studies have mainly considered external loads caused by environmental loads recently several researches have been made on the effect of internal flow fylling et al 1988 carried out a quasi static analysis for the calculation of loads from internal fluid flow an approximate solution was developed for a slug flow which travels through a flexible pipe at constant speed fylling et al 1995 analyzed the dynamics of pipe with a simple dynamic model of prescribed slug flow the mass matrix was updated according to the slug position at every time step and forces induced by the slug flow were added to the dynamic equilibrium equation gundersen et al 2012 developed an analysis methodology to determine the remnant fatigue life of flexible risers subjected to simple slug flow and wave loads they demonstrated that the fatigue life of a flexible riser is decreased due to the effects of slug flow ortega et al 2017 developed two coupled in house codes to identify and quantify the effects of slug flow and regular wave loads on the dynamic responses of a flexible riser onuoha et al 2018 presented an improvised coupling technique for stress impact and dynamic response studies of a flowline riser system exposed to cyclic loadings resulting from severe slug flow the study involved partial coupling of transient multiphase flow simulator olga and structural finite element code abaqus from the above literature review results many studies have treated the dynamic and structural analysis of risers due to environmental loads regarding the effects of slug flow several studies have focused on the numerical methods to consider the slug flow in the riser dynamic analysis it has also been investigated how the dynamic and structural responses of the riser are affected by the slug flow under limited conditions however little literature has treated how the effect differs quantitatively depending on the characteristics of risers and the slug flow in this paper a procedure to analyze the dynamic and structural response of the riser is established in consideration of environmental load and slug flow through a series of parametric studies the effects of slug flow on risers are quantitatively compared to find out what conditions the slug flow is the most affective to accurately evaluate the effects of slug flow a fully coupled global dynamic analysis of vessel mooring riser system is required considering not only slug flow but also wave wind and current in this study a methodology has been developed for an evaluation of the effects of slug flow on the dynamic responses and fatigue damages of risers a coupled time domain analysis program is used to calculate the dynamic responses of a riser induced by slug induced loads and environmental loads cyclic regular slug flows are assumed in the analysis as a time dependent variation of internal fluid density a multiphase flow simulation program is used to calculate the precise slug parameters for subsea production conditions local stress and fatigue damage of risers are estimated using an in house code

considered for the idealization of slug flow hydrocarbon composition and production rate of subsea well remain constant the characteristics of the internal flow show a similar trend over the entire duration of the simulation main parameters for slug modeling are the mass flow rate and the slug length as shown in fig 5 a comparison of the conceptual mass flow rate between the original and the idealized regular slug is shown in fig 6 the regular mass flow rate of slug and between slugs are average values of the original slug flow as eqs 9 and 10 the regular duration of slug and between

carefully taken into account dnv gl 2017 in this study a numerical code has been developed for the local stress calculation of tensile armor based on nugteren 2015 and larsen et al 2017 the following stress components are accounted for the calculation of local stress axis symmetric stress due to effective tension and pressure friction stress due to stick slip behavior local bending stress of helix element the geometry of tensile armor for the flexible riser is shown in fig 7 the total local stress of tensile armor can be summarized in eq 20 24 with the assumption of constant loading characteristics the local stress is calculated using in house code according to the procedure shown in fig 8 the first step is to calculate the axis symmetric stress and the contact pressure using the calculation results of the global dynamic analysis the hysteresis curve is obtained using the riser specifications and the contact pressure and then the friction and local bending stress are

calculation conditions 3 1 description of vessel mooring riser system the global dynamic analysis model in this study consists of a vessel mooring lines and a riser the vessel is a ship shaped floating production storage and offloading fpso moored in 1829 m water depth by semi taut lines with a turret one production riser for each case is assumed for a study purpose the specifications of vessel mooring riser system are obtained from the previous study by kim and kim 2015 the main particulars and loading condition data of the fpso are given in table 1 the discretized hull panel model is presented in fig 9 the mooring system consists of twelve chain polyester rope chain lines in three bundles of four lines the angle between bundles is 90 deg and the angle between lines in each bundle is 5 deg four different riser types are considered in order to compare dynamic and structural behaviors the specifications of mooring and riser are summarized in table 2 and table 3 the static configurations of the risers are presented in fig 10 and each type shows almost the same results regardless of the riser material fig 11 shows the modeling of the fpso mooring riser system for the global dynamic analysis 3 2 description of environmental conditions the environmental conditions of the gulf of mexico are considered for the parametric study table 4 presents the summary of environmental data iso 2005 irregular wave sea states and wind speeds are calculated by jonswap with gamma of 2 4 and npd spectrum wind speeds of 1 h average values and constant current speeds are assumed in the simulation as shown in fig 12 the incident heading angles of wave wind and current are 180 150 and 145 deg respectively the sea states for the fatigue damage estimation as presented in table 5 cheng and cao 2013 h s t p v w and v c in the table are significant wave height peak wave period 1 h average wind speed and constant current speed respectively the spectral characteristics of wave and wind are the same as those for the parametric study collinear all heading angles 180 deg and non collinear fig 12 heading combinations are considered for the calculation 3 3 description of hydrocarbon production the multiphase flow simulation is performed in order to obtain the characteristics of slug flow normal black oil is considered as internal fluid of the riser the hydrocarbon fluid compositions and production rates are summarized in table 6 and table 7 table 8 presents the thermal material properties of risers for the estimation of heat transfer between riser and seawater 4 results and discussion 4 1 verification of numerical model verifications of numerical models and local stress calculation are carried out prior to the parametric study on the effects of slug flow for the verification numerical simulations are performed for the same calculation conditions as the published literatures and results are compared kim and kim 2015 skeie et al 2012 the global dynamic analysis of the vessel mooring riser system has been carried out for 100 year return period environmental condition used in the reference literature the same specifications of the fpso mooring lines and riser as the reference are used the comparison results of the stress responses for the steel lazy wave riser are shown in fig 13 and fig 14 the solid lines and symbols are the results of the present study and reference literature respectively the two results are almost similar and the slight difference is thought to be due to the effect of random seeds of the irregular environmental loads and minor modeling parameters an in house numerical code has been developed to evaluate the local stress of tensile armor of flexible riser hysteresis curves for the 6 inch flexible riser considered in the reference literature are calculated for the verification of the in house code an axial force of 1000 kn and a friction coefficient of 0 2 are considered for the analysis as described in the reference as shown in fig 15 the hysteresis curve of the present study show a good agreement with that of the reference as the results of verification it can be confirmed that reasonable results can be obtained through the numerical models of this paper 4 2 verification of on slug modeling in this paper the slug flow in the risers are idealized as the regular slug flow for the global dynamic analysis the constant period and amplitude of the mass flow rate are assumed as the average value of long term irregular slug flow by the flow simulation the verification of slug modeling method is carried out to confirm that the regular slug modeling is suitable for the quantitative evaluation of the effects of slug flow the flexible lazy wave riser is considered in the verification work three representative flow cases from the multiphase flow simulations are considered in the study the fatigue damages with different slug modeling methods are compared fig 16 shows the original mass flow rates at sag bend of the flexible lazy wave riser and two types of modeling results the green dotted line is time series of original mass flow rate calculated from the flow simulation and the blue solid line is the reference modelling considering the period and amplitude of the individual slug flow which is expected to have nearly the same effect as the original mass flow the red solid line is the result of the modeling that is regularized using the average value of the entire duration in accordance with the method described in section 2 2 case 1 has the highest mass flow rate and has almost regular flow characteristics in contrast case 3 has the lowest mass flow rate and high irregular characteristics case 2 has intermediate characteristics between case 1 and case 3 as shown in fig 17 the spectral density of the reference modeling is almost identical to the result of the original flow rate in case of regular slug modeling the spectral density responses are concentrated at specific peak frequencies fig 18 and fig 19 show the comparison results of the local stress response and the annual fatigue damage of the inner tensile armor at sag bend for different modeling methods only the dynamic and structural responses of the riser due to the slug flow are calculated not including environmental loads the annual fatigue damages are estimated using s n curve for base material of high strength steel sousa et al 2012 more detailed description about parameters for the fatigue damage calculation is presented in the following section 4 8 differences of the annual fatigue damage between the reference and regular slug modeling are not significant for all three cases from the results of the study the regular slug modeling seems to be a suitable method for the efficient evaluation of the slug effects it should be noted that the use of regular slug modelling may not be appropriated if the characteristics of internal flow vary significantly due to the changes in well production or various subsea operations 4 3 calculation conditions for parametric study parametric studies are performed for comparison of the effects of slug flow cases of the parametric studies are presented in table 9 as an initial screening the global dynamic analysis is carried out for all riser types with an arbitrary slug flow according to the results riser types showing considerable slug are selected and then detailed parametric studies are performed for various production stages and environmental conditions 4 4 motion responses of vessel the motion responses of the fpso are calculated by the global dynamic analysis in time domain fig 20 shows some part of motion time traces of the fpso the steel catenary riser scr and steel lazy wave riser slwr without slug flow are considered in the example the motion responses show a typical tendency for a ship shaped vessel in case of the horizontal motions such as surge sway and yaw low frequency responses appear due to wave drift wind and current forces since the first order wave exciting forces are dominant factors of the vertical motions the response shows wave frequency responses it is found that the riser type has an insignificant effect on the motion responses of the fpso the riser induced forces are much smaller than environment and mooring induced forces the motion responses are therefore almost identical for all parametric studies 4 5 results of initial screening analysis the effects of slug flow with respect to different riser types are initially compared for an arbitrary slug flow as shown in fig 21 the characteristics of slug flow used in the initial screening analysis are presented in table 10 the dynamic responses of the risers considering the arbitrary slug flow are compared to the results with internal flow velocity of 0 m s table 11 shows the comparison results of effective tension and bending curvature along riser arc length the max response indicates the maximum value during simulation and the std dev response indicates the maximum value of standard deviations along the riser response differences are not significant for the maximum values the main reason is that the maximum results are greatly influenced by the identical vessel induced loads the slug flow has also little effect on the catenary shaped riser in case of the lazy wave configuration standard deviations of bending curvatures increase more than three times due to the slug flow this difference is due to the static configurations of each riser shape the maximum static curvatures for the catenary and lazy wave shape are 0 002 and 0 008 rad m respectively a high curvature produces greater centrifugal forces from the internal slug flow and the lazy wave configuration is more sensitive to the slug flow thus detailed parametric studies are performed for the steel lazy wave riser slwr and the flexible lazy wave riser flwr fig 22 presents standard deviation values for the bending curvature of the steel lazy wave riser the effects due to slug flow are most pronounced in zones of high curvature e g hog bend sag bend and touch down area the change of centrifugal force due to the slug flow in high curvature zones is dominant factor to increase the variation of bending curvature responses from the results the high curvature zone especially the sag bend needs to be focused in detailed parametric studies 4 6 results of multiphase flow simulation the characteristics of slug flow are calculated by the multiphase flow simulation during 10 h based on the initial screening steel and flexible lazy wave risers are considered in the simulation mass flow rates at sag bend of the steel lazy wave riser are presented in fig 23 it is noted that fluctuations of the flow rates are high frequency components with a period less than 120 s low frequency components are not considered in the detailed parametric studies because a severe slug with long period would be mitigated for the stable topside production in case of the early stage with high production rate the internal flow shows constant tendency due to high flow velocity the mass flow rates are fluctuated periodically in the middle and late stages as the production rates decrease idealized regular mass flow rates are needed for the application to the global dynamic analysis the mass flow rates for each production stage are idealized as shown in fig 24 the effects of the slug flow are expected to be well maintained because peak frequencies of the original and idealized flow are in good agreement as shown in fig 25 because the idealized flow has regular flow rate and period spectral densities of the idealized flow are more concentrated table 12 presents the summarized characteristics of slug flow applied to the detailed parametric studies the slug flow of the middle stage has higher flow velocity and longer slug length these results are due to the fact that the production rate of middle stage is almost twice that of the late stage the difference in heat transfer and roughness between the steel and flexible riser makes the composition of the multiphase flow different and the flow characteristics are slightly different 4 7 results of detailed parametric study the results of detailed parametric studies are described in this section the effective tension and bending curvature acting on the riser are calculated by the global dynamic analysis the dynamic responses considering specific slug flow are compared to the results with equivalent steady flow fig 26 and fig 27 show standard deviations of the effective tension and bending curvature for the flexible lazy wave riser the 1 year return period environmental condition and slug flow of the middle stage are applied to this calculation while the effective tension responses with the slug flow are almost similar to those of the steady flow case the bending curvature responses are significantly increased by slug effects especially in high curvature zones the responses of effective tension are greatly affected by environmental loads and weight variations of the entire lower rise section which are almost the same regardless of the internal flow characteristics the fluctuation standard deviation of the bending curvature is increased by the slug flow because it is affected by the local weight distribution and the centrifugal force of the internal slug flow fig 28 depicts spectral density of the bending curvature responses at sag bend the peak frequency of the wave spectrum and the slug frequency are 0 10 hz and 0 04 hz respectively the maximum value of response spectrum is calculated at 0 04 hz for the slug flow case it is evident that slug flow has significant impacts on the responses of bending curvature fig 29 shows time traces of bending curvature at sag bend under various environmental conditions the flexible lazy wave riser with slug flow of the middle stage is considered in these calculations it is found that slug flow dominates the dynamic response of bending curvature under mild sea state for the steady flow case under the mild sea state the response fluctuation is almost negligible due to small environmental loads and motion isolation effects the slug flow generates a relatively large dynamic force which increases the response fluctuation in the mild environment as the environmental conditions become severer the slug flow induced force is similar but the environmental loads increase in the case of 100 year return period condition the responses for the steady and slug flow show negligible difference the summarized results of parametric studies are presented in table 13 and table 14 the standard deviations of bending curvature at sag bend are directly compared with regard to the internal flow the main parameters of the studies are production stages flow rates and environmental conditions as presented in table 9 according to the results the flexible lazy wave riser is more sensitive to the slug flow because the bending stiffness of the flexible riser is much smaller than that of the steel riser the response differences of the flexible riser are calculated larger under similar conditions as shown in table 13 and fig 30 the differences between the results are influenced by the production stage the flow rates that vary depending on the production stage make the characteristics of slug flow different the faster flow velocity and longer slug length of the middle production stage generate larger slug induced dynamic loads as a result the effects of slug flow for the middle stage are higher than those for the late stage it means that adequate estimation of slugging parameters is required over the expected service life the results regarding the environmental conditions indicate that the slug flow under mild sea state has more substantial impacts on the riser loads as shown in table 14 and fig 31 since the effects of slug flow are much greater in the mild condition with high probability of occurrence the slug flow can be expected to have a significant influence on the fatigue damage of a riser structure 4 8 results of fatigue damage calculation the results of parametric studies demonstrate that the dynamic effects due to slug flow are significant for flexible riser lazy wave configuration and mild environmental conditions the range of fluctuation standard deviation of bending curvature increases substantially under mild sea state this means that a principal impact of the slug flow on the riser is the increase in fatigue damage the fatigue damage with and without slug flow are estimated for the steel and flexible lazy wave riser the calculation conditions for the fatigue damage estimation are presented in table 15 the rainflow counting method is used for the damage estimation dnv d curve for welds in pipelines and s n curve for base material of high strength steel are used for the steel and flexible lazy wave riser respectively dnv gl 2017 sousa et al 2012 the stress concentration factor of 1 25 is considered for the steel lazy wave riser the mean stress correction is included in the fatigue damage calculation of the flexible lazy wave riser the thickness effect is not taken into account because the thickness values of risers are smaller than the reference thickness the environmental conditions are summarized in table 5 all 280 load cases are considered for the global dynamic analysis in time domain the stress time series are derived for the dynamic responses during 3 h simulation two specific points are considered to investigate the effects of slug flow on the fatigue damage as shown in fig 32 the outermost radial position and inner tensile armor are selected for the steel lazy wave riser and flexible lazy wave riser respectively in case of the flexible lazy wave riser curvature stress hysteresis curves are considered for the calculation of the local stress of inner tensile armor the hysteresis curve depends on material specifications and the internal and external pressure of the riser fig 33 shows the hysteresis curves at the sag bend location for the internal pressure of the middle production stage the local stress responses are calculated using these hysteresis curve as shown in fig 34 examples of stress histogram for the steady and slug flow condition are presented in fig 35 the middle production stage and collinear environmental heading combination are assumed in the examples the environmental condition no 3 and no 12 represent mild and harsh conditions respectively it is noted that the number of cycles are displayed only up to 600 cycles in fig 35 when the internal flow is steady under the mild environmental condition the maximum stress range is less than 1 0 mpa for both riser types considering the slug flow the maximum stress range of the steel and flexible lazy wave riser are 3 5 and 7 8 mpa respectively in case of the harsh environmental condition the increase rate of the maximum stress range due to slug flow is lower than the mild environmental condition the effects of slug flow on the fatigue damage become more significant for the mild sea state and the flexible lazy wave riser these results show a good agreement with those predicted in the detailed parametric studies the annual fatigue damages for the 14 environmental conditions are presented in fig 36 the estimation results show a similar trend between the steel and flexible lazy wave riser in case of the mild sea states environmental conditions of lower number the fatigue damages vary greatly depending on whether the slug flow is included or not it means that the slug induced fatigue damages are much greater than environmental loads induced damages for the mild sea states the effects of slug flow are not significant for the harsh sea states because of large environmental loads in the absence of slug flow the environment induced fatigue damages for the mild sea states are negligible thus the damages are calculated to be smaller than those for the harsh sea states even if the probability of occurrence for the mild sea state is high since the fluctuations of stress due to the slug flow are significant in the mild sea states the fatigue damages with slug flow are larger than those for the harsh sea states because of their high probability of occurrence the summarized annual fatigue damage with and without slug flow are presented in table 16 a factor of safety of 10 is considered for the calculation of fatigue life it is noted that the slug flow is not considered in the early production stage according to the results of multiphase flow analysis the estimation results show significant fatigue contributions of slug flow the fatigue damage with slug flow case 2 is much greater than that with steady flow case 1 especially for the flexible lazy wave riser in case of the flexible riser the fatigue damage increases by about 1000 times if it includes the slug flow the effects of slug flow on the fatigue are sensitive to the slug flow characteristics for each production stage this is because the stress range is different as the velocity and length of slug flow are changed it means that appropriate estimation of the slugging parameters is required taking into account the riser types and the production flow characteristics the fatigue lives in this study are evaluated longer than normal service life of risers even considering the slug flow however the effects of slug flow should be sufficiently taken into account in the riser design where there is not enough margin for the fatigue life because the fatigue damage can be significantly increased due to the slug flow 5 conclusions in this study the effects of slug flow on the dynamic responses and fatigue damage of risers were estimated by using the global dynamic analysis the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave loads of the fpso were computed by the hydrodynamic analysis the characteristics of slug flow for each riser and production stage were obtained from the multiphase flow simulation parametric studies were performed considering different calculation conditions in order to investigate the effects of slug flow the fatigue damages with and without slug flow were compared for the estimation of the fatigue contribution of slug flow from the results of studies the following conclusions can be drawn the dynamic loads induced by slug flow consist of weight variations centrifugal and coriolis forces the effective tension and the maximum bending curvature responses are almost unaffected by the slug induced loads the standard deviations response fluctuations of bending curvature are significantly increased by the slug flow the verifications of the numerical model and slug modeling method have been carried out prior to the parametric study the numerical simulation model for the global dynamic analysis and in house code for the local stress calculation of the flexible riser are verified by comparing the results with reference literatures according to the verification result of the slug modeling method the regular slug modeling seems to be a suitable method for the estimation of the effects of slug flow the results of the parametric studies demonstrate that the effects of slug flow are most pronounced in areas along the lazy wave riser with high curvature zones e g hog and sag bend and touch down area the most critical production stage is a middle stage where the flow rate is half of the maximum value the slug flow has more substantial impact on a flexible riser due to its lower value of bending stiffness since the environmental loads are small the effects of slug flow under mild sea states dominate the dynamic responses of riser according to the results of the parametric studies the variations of bending curvature are increased by the slug flow especially under mild sea states with high probability of occurrence it means that a main impact of the slug flow is the increased fatigue damage of a riser structure the fatigue damages with and without slug flow have been estimated in order to investigate the fatigue contributions of slug flow the stress ranges for the mild sea states are greatly increased by the slug flow the dynamic responses and fatigue damage of risers are sensitive to the characteristics of riser system and slug flow the standard deviations of bending curvature and stress range are different as the velocity and length of slug flow are changed this means that appropriate estimation of slugging parameters is required over the expected service life through the above study results the slug flow inside the riser definitely affects the fatigue life of the riser the effect of slug flow at the sag bend position of the flexible lazy wave riser is found significant at the design stage of the riser the need for further evaluation of the slug effects may be low if the fatigue life at sag bend without the slug flow is sufficiently longer than the normal service life the effects of slug flow should be taken into account in the riser design where there is not enough margin for fatigue life of the riser for the risers covered in this paper the fatigue damage increases from 100 to 1000 times due to the slug induced load credit authorship contribution statement hyeonsu jeong conceptualization methodology software

varying from 1d to 5d at re 500 1000 1500 and 2000 spherical and flat end structure shapes are also investigated for the blind tee section firstly flow simulations in a straight pipe are performed and the numerical results are compared with the analytical solutions then the computed velocity profiles are used as the inlet velocity for the simulations of blind tee pipes flow characteristics both inside and downstream the blind tee section are numerically studied by analyzing the streamlines pressure contours and velocity profiles the results reveal that a higher inlet velocity and a blind tee length no more than 3d can achieve a better mixing condition for the fluid flow in blind tee pipes while stagnant flows are more prone to occur towards the end of the blind tee section at low velocities with the length longer than 3d leading to potential fluid deposition in blind tee pipes keywords laminar flow blind tee pipe flow mixing three dimensional simulation 1 introduction process piping systems in the offshore oil gas platforms and subsea production systems do not always have a straight pipe geometry the configurations of these pipelines are usually zigzag or snake like in order to provide a good layout flexibility in the limited space therefore the pipe fittings and joints such as elbows blind tees t junctions and y junctions are commonly adopted in these piping systems the fluid flow at the connections or joint parts of the pipelines behaves differently from the flow of fluid in a straight pipe as reported by humphrey et al 1985 soleimani 1999 and vasava 2007 this is especially true for the common multiphase flows encountered in the oil and gas industry since the phase separation deposition and flow mixing often occur at the bends and junctions the flow characteristics inside these connections need to be studied in order to allow for an appropriate flow engineering design first the potential for deposits inside the pipe joints should be checked as these may affect the internal flow patterns of the pipelines second it should be investigated whether the flow especially multiphase flow is well mixed when passing through the pipe fittings so that the measurements can be successfully implemented with relevant sensors e g particle concentration sensors according to the open literature many experimental analytical and numerical studies have been carried out to investigate single phase flows inside straight pipes curved pipes 90 elbows and t junctions at first velocity profiles and other characteristics of the laminar flow in straight pipes were solved according to the basic fluid equations hornbeck 1964 friedmann et al 1968 with the aid of measuring equipment and numerical simulation laufer 1954 and eggels et al 1994 analyzed the turbulent structures of fully developed pipe flow then the complicated flow patterns at bends and joints of the pipelines attracted more and more attention of the researchers the secondary motions of both the laminar and turbulent flows in 180 curved pipes were calculated and analyzed by patankar et al 1983 and shirayama and kuwahara 1987 jarrahi et al 2011 and kim et al 2014 studied the characteristics and mixing of the swirling flow induced by 90 elbow pipes for t junctions costa et al 2006 and beneš et al 2013 revealed the influences of the junction edge and cross section geometry on the pipe flow in addition various investigations have been performed to study the flow patterns inside subsea pipelines and solve the problems induced by multiphase flows for the offshore oil and gas productions such as the slug flows corrosions erosions and flow depositions reported by li et al 2018 pouraria et al 2016b holmedal et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 and wang et al 2015 with the aid of multiphase test facilities oil gas and oil water flows in vertical horizontal and hilly terrain pipelines were measured and new flow patterns were identified by abduvayt et al 2004 and akhiyarov et al 2010 pouraria et al 2016a developed a numerical model for the oil water flow in a subsea pipeline and successfully predicted the internal flow structures under different working conditions peng et al 2013 and liu et al 2015 discussed the flow characteristics of oil and gas products with solid particles in 90 elbow and t junction pipes baker et al 2007 and zhao et al 2017 measured the gas liquid flow at t junctions and elbows and proposed new strategies to control the relevant flow patterns and phase distributions among different geometric configurations of the offshore and subsea pipelines blind tees are the one common feature in the technologies of multiphase flow meters most of these meters available on the market require an upstream blind tee in order to achieve a specified metrology brister 2013 pinguet et al 2014a and the blind tee is also an ideal location for the sampling of multiphase flow in subsea pipelines pinguet et al 2014b in addition blind tees are usually used instead of standard elbows in industrial practice to reduce particle erosions in piping systems chen et al 2006 pouraria et al 2017 and duarte et al 2020 carried out numerical studies to access the relative erosions in blind tees and indicated that the erosion rate was significantly affected by the pipe diameter flow velocity and mass loading of the fluid therefore analyzing flow characteristics in blind tee pipes is important for evaluating the pressure loss mixing conditions particle erosions and depositions in multiphase flow metering a typical blind tee pipe is shown in fig 1 however detailed flow physics inside blind tee pipes has not yet been thoroughly investigated in the open literature to the authors knowledge only ong et al 2017 studied some configurations of blind tees at re 1000 there are many factors that may affect the flow characteristics inside blind tee pipes in multiphase flow metering a dispersed flow pattern is frequently observed the feature of this flow pattern is that it has a strong correlation with the primary phase i e oil or gas thus as the first step of the research on blind tee pipes this paper will focus on the single primary phase to analyze the basic flow characteristics in blind tees the main objective of the present study is to make a more general and in depth understanding of the physics associated with single phase flow in blind tee pipes with different configurations and a wide range of working conditions that have not been revealed in the previous studies the results and findings are expected to provide inspirations for relevant research on multiphase flows in blind tees such as the sand wax depositions flow corrosions erosions and the oil water gas water mixing conditions in this study the flow characteristics in blind tee pipes will be investigated under different lengths and end structure shapes of the blind tee section using three dimensional computational fluid dynamics cfd method although the mixing of flow in process systems is generally turbulent laminar flow problems do exist in some pipelines of oil and gas industry such as the specific pipe flow of waxy crude oil heavy oil and water in oil emulsions nazar et al 2005 keleşoğlu et al 2012 guo et al 2018 therefore in this paper the fluid mixing conditions in the blind tee pipes will be analyzed at reynolds numbers ranging from 500 to 2000 all of which are in laminar flow regime based on detailed flow patterns and pressure distributions along the pipes the effects of the blind tee length end structure shape and inlet velocity on the flow characteristics in blind tee pipes will be identified and a critical length of the blind tee section will be determined in order to avoid fluid deposition in the blind tees it could provide a useful engineering tool for understanding the flow physics in blind tee pipes and can be used to estimate the mixing conditions induced by the blind tees 2 methodology since there is no available flow data for blind tee pipes this study will firstly simulate the three dimensional flow in a straight pipe and verify the numerical results against the analytical solutions given in cengel and cimbala 2014 subsequently the pipe flow with the verified incoming velocity profile will be set at the inlet of the blind tee pipes with blind tee lengths varying from 1d to 5d here d is the pipe diameter the corresponding flow characteristics will be studied in the blind tee pipes with two different end structure shapes i e spherical end and flat end at re 500 1000 1500 and 2000 2 1 numerical method the objective of the present numerical simulation is to solve the three dimensional incompressible navier stokes equations for the single phase laminar flow of a newtonian fluid since the working fluid in this paper is incompressible the density of the fluid does not change with the time and spatial position therefore the governing equations include the continuity and momentum equations which can be written as 1 u 0 2 u t u u 1 ρ p ν δ u where ρ and ν respectively represent the density and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid u represents the velocity vector of the fluid flow and p is the static pressure the commercial cfd software ansys cfx which is widely used for a variety of flows in the ocean engineering has been adopted for the numerical simulations in the present study it employs a pressure based coupled solver using time implicit algorithm and applies a three dimensional element based finite volume method for the solution of navier stokes equations raw 1985 a high resolution advection scheme is used for the spatial discretization and a second order backward euler approach is employed for the transient terms ansys cfx solver guide 2012 2 2 computational model the computational domains boundaries and geometrical parameters for the straight pipe and the blind tee pipes are shown in fig 2 the corresponding boundary conditions are specified as follows a inlet according to the classical formula given in cengel and cimbala 2014 the fully developed velocity profile for the laminar pipe flow can be analytically described as 3 u z r 2 u z a v g 1 r 2 r 2 where u z a v g is the average inlet flow velocity r is the radius of the pipe and r is the radial distance from the pipe center in order to reduce the time consumption of the numerical simulations and avoid using very large computational domains the analytical velocity profile obtained by eq 3 is set as the inlet boundary condition there are five different reynolds numbers re u z a v g d ν investigated in this paper where d 1 m and ν 0 001 m2 s thus for the flow simulation at each reynolds number the velocity profile is computed with the corresponding average inlet velocity u z a v g e g u z a v g 1 m s for the case of re 1000 the pressure boundary condition is also set at the inlet with zero normal gradient b outlet for the outlet the velocity boundary condition is set as zero normal gradient and the pressure boundary condition is set to be zero c wall on the internal walls of the pipe i e the solid walls of the computational domain a non slip boundary condition is prescribed and the pressure boundary condition is set as zero normal gradient in order to make sure the final steady solutions are obtained for the flow analysis in blind tee pipes the total simulation times at re 500 1000 1500 and 2000 in the present work are set as 40s 20s 14s and 10s respectively which are over twice the amount of time required to achieve stabilized solutions when the rms residuals stay lower than 10 5 and the residuals of mass conservation are not more than 10 3 the numerical simulations are considered to have converged 3 validation of cfd method in order to validate the accuracy of the cfd method used in the present study three dimensional numerical simulations have been performed to compute the flow in a straight pipe with the pipe diameter d 1 m and the pipe length l 10 d at re 500 1000 1500 and 2000 the corresponding average inlet velocities for these computational flow conditions are u z a v g 0 5 m s 1 m s 1 5 m s and 2 m s respectively the grid and time step convergence studies are presented in this section and the numerical results of the flow velocity profiles are verified against the analytical solutions a grid convergence study is carried out with m e s h 1 5544 elements m e s h 2 11 718 elements m e s h 3 20992 elements and m e s h 4 42 840 elements at different reynolds numbers as well as the maximum courant number m c n 0 1 all the computational meshes were generated using ansys icem cfd with multi block structured grids the predicted cross sectional velocity profiles u z of these meshes at re 1000 are shown in fig 3 a with respect to the dimensionless radial position r d from 0 5 to 0 5 at the location of z 5 d it is observed that the numerical results change greatly with the increase of the grid number when the mesh is less than 20 992 elements compared to the results obtained by mesh 3 the maximum deviations of the velocity profiles in mesh 1 and mesh 2 are 3 19 and 2 31 respectively moreover the averaged velocity deviations across the section are 1 34 and 0 99 respectively when the grid number increases to more than 20 992 elements the maximum difference between the computational velocity profiles in mesh 3 and mesh 4 decreases to 0 92 and the corresponding average difference across the whole section decreases to only 0 41 therefore according to the comparison it can be found that mesh 3 with 20 992 elements provides sufficient numerical accuracy for the straight pipe case subsequently a time step convergence study has been performed for mesh 3 20 992 elements with three different maximum courant numbers i e m c n 0 1 0 3 and 1 the result of the time step convergence study is given in fig 3 b which appears that the maximum courant number m c n 0 3 is found to be sufficiently accurate for the present numerical simulation for the validation of these computational results the analytical solutions are employed to make a comparison with the corresponding numerical velocity profiles obtained by mesh 3 with m c n 0 3 the comparisons as shown in fig 4 are performed for all the reynolds numbers analyzed in this paper it can be found that the predicted velocity profiles are in good agreement with the analytical solutions at different reynolds numbers which proves that the mesh with 20 992 elements mesh 3 using the maximum courant number m c n 0 3 achieves sufficient accuracy for the numerical simulations of laminar pipe flow in the present study 4 results and discussions the flow prediction for the straight pipe case discussed in section 3 presents an approach to achieve a fully developed laminar pipe flow which can be utilized for simulating the flow physics in blind tee pipes the fully developed velocity profiles obtained from the straight pipe case are set as the inlet velocity profiles for the blind tee pipes at re 500 1000 1500 and 2000 respectively numerical simulations of the three dimensional flows in blind tee pipes with five different blind tee lengths i e b t l 1d 2d 3d 4d and 5d and two different end structure shapes i e spherical end and flat end are performed in the present study the main objective is to investigate numerically how the increments of the blind tee length and the flow velocity affect the fluid mixing inside the blind tee pipes and analyze the effects of the spherical and flat end shapes on the pipe flow for the convenience of the discussion all the computational cases of the blind tee pipes in this paper are named with the blind tee length i e btl1 to btl5 respectively represent b t l 1d to 5d the end structure shape of the blind tee section i e s and f respectively represent the spherical end and the flat end and the corresponding reynolds number thus case btl3 s re1000 represents the numerical simulation of the blind tee pipe with b t l 3d and a spherical end at re 1000 4 1 grid resolution test grid resolution tests have been performed for all the computational cases here case btl3 s re1000 is provided as an instance for the comparison of the numerical results obtained using three different grid resolutions with the maximum courant number m c n 0 3 mesh 1 mesh 2 and mesh 3 for the whole blind tee pipe contain 67 476 elements 143 324 elements and 285 653 elements respectively and the grid numbers specifically for the blind tee section are 12 224 25 760 and 52 736 respectively fig 5 a shows the major locations where the velocity profiles are extracted for the flow analysis of blind tee pipes and the grid details of the blind tee section are presented in fig 5 b and c as shown in fig 6 the cross sectional velocity profiles at the locations of z 15d and y 20d in the symmetrical plane i e the y o z plane and the flow patterns inside the blind tee section are employed to make a qualitative and quantitative comparison for the grid resolution test it is clearly seen that both the velocity profiles and the flow details in the numerical results of mesh 2 with 143 324 elements and mesh 3 with 285 653 elements are very close to each other according to fig 6 a the maximum difference between the results of mesh 2 and mesh 3 is 1 52 and the average difference is only 0 78 even at the location downstream the blind tee i e y 20d when the grid resolution decreases to mesh 1 with 67 476 elements both the maximum and average differences in the velocity profiles greatly increase to more than 5 compared to the results of mesh 2 in addition both the flow details obtained with mesh 2 and mesh 3 in fig 6 b indicate that there are two main flow vortices inside the blind tee section in case btl3 s re1000 where the distributions of the velocity contours and vectors agree well with each other however only one main vortex can be observed in this region in the result of mesh 1 the velocity distribution and vortex location of which are quite different from that of mesh 2 and mesh 3 therefore mesh 2 with 143 324 elements is considered to have sufficient grid resolution which also achieves a good agreement with the analytical solution of the fully developed laminar pipe flow at the entrance of the blind tee section 4 2 effect of blind tee length in order to figure out the effect of the blind tee length on the flow physics in blind tee pipes three dimensional laminar flow simulations at different reynolds numbers have been carried out for the blind tee pipes with b t l 1d to 5d fig 7 shows the streamlines on the symmetrical plane for case btl3 s re1000 and the corresponding cross sectional velocity profiles at the selected locations i e z 15d y 2d y 5d y 10d and y 20d as presented in fig 5 are also displayed together with the velocity profile at the inlet the analytical solution it is clearly seen that the fully developed laminar incoming flow which is obtained and verified in the straight pipe case extends towards the blind tee section until z 15d then flow circulations and vortices are generated due to the existence of the blind tee section and the 90 bend as a consequence the cross sectional velocity profiles at y 2d to 10d do not exhibit a parabolic shape which is quite different from the velocity profile at z 15d as shown in fig 7 b it also gives some insight into the mixing process of the fluid flow downstream the blind tee section at y 2d dramatical changes of the cross sectional velocities are induced by the flow circulations and vortices it reports a significant influence of the blind tee section on the downstream flow pattern which promotes the mixing of the fully developed incoming flow then the distribution of the velocity profile becomes more and more uniform in the range of y 5d to 10d it proves a fully mixing process of the pipe flow and provides a good choice for the sampling locations of relevant flow meters finally the cross sectional velocity profile gradually got back to a parabolic shape along the pipe as shown at y 20d three dimensional streamlines in the blind tee pipes with b t l 1d to 5d at re 1000 are given in fig 8 a e which are colored by the dimensionless velocity u u z a v g ranging for 0 to 2 here u is the magnitude of the flow velocity by plotting the three dimensional streamlines the behavior of how the fluid is flowing inside the investigated pipes especially the blind tee section can be observed more clearly it shows that all the streams coming from the inlet keep a straight line when arriving at the entrance of the blind tee section some of the fluid directly flows towards the outlet by a 90 turning and the rest of the fluid flows towards the blind tee section since the end of the blind tee section is blanked off the fluid is trapped in this part as a result when the fluid hits the blanked off end it flows back and generates flow circulations and vortices not only in the blind tee section but also in the downstream main pipe it is observed that the flow circulations inside the blind tee sections are of different sizes which are influenced by the blind tee length the sizes of flow circulations in blind tees shown in fig 8 are determined as follows firstly the three dimensional streamlines are used to observe the basic structures of flow circulations in the blind tee section then the swirling strength and velocity profile on the cross section are extracted and analyzed in every distance along the flow direction since these parameters will greatly decrease at the edge of a vortex finally an approximate size can be estimated in order to provide a more intuitive understanding of the sizes and patterns of flow circulations in the blind tee section in case btl1 s re1000 and case btl2 s re1000 the approximate sizes of the flow circulations in the blind tee section are 1d and 2d respectively it reveals that for the blind tee pipes with b t l 1d and 2d there is only one flow circulation existing in the blind tee section the size of which equals to the corresponding blind tee length when the btl increases to 3d a second flow circulation begins to appear in the blind tee section for case btl3 s re1000 the approximate size of the first flow circulation is around 2 5d in this particular blind tee pipe meanwhile a vague shape of the second flow circulation is formed with a size around 0 5d as shown in fig 8 c even though it is influenced and involved by the first circulation as the btl continues to increase two flow circulations can be clearly seen in the blind tee pipe with b t l 4d the first circulation has a size around 2 5d and the size of the second one is about 1 5d the second flow circulation with a lower velocity can be taken as a stagnant flow circulation since the fluid exchange between this circulation and the flow in the main pipe is observed to be limited fig 8 e shows that there are three flow circulations existing in the blind tee pipe with b t l 5d the first two circulations still have a size around 2 5d and 1 5d respectively and the third one shows up with an approximate size of 1d however the velocity of the third flow circulation is quite low indicating that the fluid flow there becomes almost fully stagnant generally for the flow condition of re 1000 it can be concluded that the fluid which is trapped inside the blind tee section with b t l 3d only forms one flow circulation while for b t l 3d more than one flow circulation is generated it appears that the maximum capability of the fluid to create the first flow circulation inside the blind tee section is limited to a size around 2 5d the maximum size of the next flow circulation is about 1 5d which is smaller than that of the first one it reveals that the flow becomes weaker when it travels towards the end of the blind tee section which is physically sound pressure contours for the five computational cases of blind tee pipes are shown in fig 9 the dimensionless pressure which is defined as 2 p ρ u z a v g 2 is employed for the comparison it can be clearly seen that the pressure in the blind tee section increases with the increase of the blind tee length implying that stagnant fluid with lower velocity is more prone to occur in the blind tee pipe with a longer blind tee section this observation is consistent with the flow characteristics reported by the streamlines in fig 8 for the mixing condition of the flow downstream the blind tee section fig 10 displays the velocity contours and vectors on the sections of y 2d 5d and 10d it can be seen that the strength of the swirling flow in the downstream main pipe also depends on the blind tee length in case btl1 s re1000 there is only one main swirling flow existing in the downstream pipe when the length of the blind tee section increases two flow vortices appear in the blind tee pipes with b t l 2d to 5d see fig 10 b e the corresponding velocity distributions at y 5d and 10d are observed to be more uniform than that of the case with b t l 1d it indicates that compared to the one swirling flow generated by the blind tee section with 1d length the two flow vortices created by a longer blind tee section promote a better mixing of the fluid inside the blind tee pipes however when the btl is longer than 3d the unevenness of the velocity distributions at y 5d and 10d turns to be greater since the strength of the flow vortices becomes weaker in the blind tee pipes with b t l 4d and 5d by summarizing the aforementioned findings for re 1000 analyzed in this section the blind tee pipes with btl in the range of 2d to 3d can achieve a better mixing condition of the laminar pipe flow by generating flow circulations and vortices with proper sizes numbers and strength in both the blind tee section and the downstream pipe for b t l 3d flow circulations with lower velocity are generated which may lead to stagnant fluid and potential depositions i e bad fluid mixing condition towards the blind tee end while for b t l 2d only one main swirling flow is not enough for the fully mixing of the laminar pipe flow 4 3 effect of blind tee end structure shape two different end structure shapes of the blind tee section i e spherical end and flat end have been investigated in the present study as a comparison for the blind tee pipes with spherical end in fig 8 three dimensional streamlines for the blind tee pipes with flat end at re 1000 are given in fig 11 in the flat end cases it also can be found that only one main flow circulation occurs in the blind tee section when b t l 1d and 2d as the btl increases a second flow circulation forms in case btl3 f re1000 and case btl4 f re1000 and a third circulation is observed in case btl5 f re1000 for the pipes with the same btl the numbers and approximate sizes of the flow circulations in the flat blind tee section appear to be consistent with that of the spherical blind tee section however different from the spherical end flow vortices with very small sizes are induced by the rectangular junction of the flat end and the cylindrical wall as marked with dash circles in fig 11 a and b these small vortices can be also treated as stagnant flow since the corresponding velocities are quite low they will increase the deposition possibility of multiphase flows at the end of the blind tee section especially for blind tee pipes with b t l 3d with the increase of the blind tee length the small vortices are gradually merged in the second or third flow circulation as presented in fig 11 c e in order to analysis the effect of different end structure shapes on the fluid flow downstream the blind tee section a comparison has been made for blind tee pipes with b t l 1d to 5d in fig 12 it shows the trends of how the average velocities on different downstream sections i e y 2d 5d and 10d change with the increase of the btl in the two end structure shapes according to the comparison it can be seen that the trends of the average velocities in the blind tee pipes with flat end are consistent with that of the pipes with spherical end it indicates that for both the flat and spherical end shapes the major flow characteristics downstream the blind tee section remain unchanged according to the details of the comparison the velocities at y 2d in the spherical end cases are greater than that of the corresponding cases with flat end the velocity differences between the two end shapes become smaller at y 5d and 10d it reveals that the influence of the end structure shape mainly affects the flow near the blind tee section which is gradually reduced and disappears along the downstream pipe meanwhile when the b t l 5d flow velocities in different end structures are almost the same it means that there is insignificant effect of the end structure shape on the internal flow of blind tee pipes when the blind tee section is long enough to sum up for the particular end structure shapes analyzed in the present study the major flow characteristics both inside and downstream the blind tee section stay the same the end structure shape only affects the flow details close to the blind tee section for b t l 3d small flow vortices are generated at the flat end leading to more stagnant fluid in the blind tee section when b t l 3d the influences of different end shapes become weaker which almost disappears in the blind tee pipe with b t l 5d 4 4 effect of flow velocity in this section the effect of the flow velocity in blind tee pipes will be analyzed using the dimensionless reynolds numbers numerical simulations have been carried out at four different reynolds numbers in laminar flow regime i e re 500 1000 1500 and 2000 and the corresponding average velocities of the inlet flow are u z avg 0 5 m s 1 m s 1 5 m s and 2 m s respectively according to section 4 2 the blind tee pipe with b t l 5d provides the most flow information of the circulations in the blind tee section which is a good choice for analyzing the flow characteristics under different reynolds numbers therefore in this section the cfd cases with b t l 5d are investigated in order to figure out the effect of flow velocity on the internal flow of blind tee pipes streamlines in the blind tee pipe with b t l 5d at the four reynolds numbers are shown in fig 13 it can be clearly seen that for the same blind tee pipe the flow pattern inside the blind tee section varies with the reynolds number including the sizes and numbers of the flow circulations at the condition of re 500 there are three flow circulations existing in the blind tee section see fig 13 a it is observed that the approximate sizes of the first two circulations are respectively 2 2d and 1 3d for the third circulation although it has a size around 1 5d the velocity there is quite low leading to a fully stagnant flow at the end of the blind tee section with the increase of the flow velocity the first two circulations in the 5d blind tee section become larger with a higher velocity as shown in fig 13 b d as a consequence the third flow circulation turns to be smaller and gradually disappeared together with the influence of the stagnant flow at the blind tee end when the flow velocity increases to re 2000 only two flow circulations can be observed in the blind tee section the sizes of which reach up to around 3d and 2d respectively it reveals that the incoming flow with a higher inlet velocity can reduce the potential of stagnant flow in the blind tee section and achieve a better mixing condition inside the blind tee pipe in general for the blind tee pipe with b t l 5d it can be concluded that the fluid trapped inside the blind tee section can form three flow circulations when re 1500 while when re 2000 only two flow circulations are generated it also appears that the maximum capability of the laminar flow to create the first flow circulation inside the blind tee section is limited to a size around 3d the maximum size of the first circulation varies from 2 2d to 3d when the reynolds number changes in the range of 500 2000 it suggests that the length of the blind tee section should be no more than 3d which could effectively avoid the potential flow deposition at the end of the blind tee section induced by the second or third flow circulation pressure contours for the blind tee pipe with b t l 5d at different reynolds numbers are displayed in fig 14 from the comparison of the pressure contours in the four cases it can be seen that the dimensionless pressure in the blind tee section decreases with the increase of the flow velocity it means that fewer stagnant fluid occurs in the blind tee section with a higher inlet flow velocity which is consistent with the flow characteristics revealed by the streamlines in fig 13 in order to analyze the effect of inlet velocity on the flow pattern downstream the blind tee section cross sectional velocity profiles at the selected locations i e z 15d y 2d y 5d y 10d and y 20d on the symmetrical plane of the blind tee pipe are compared at re 500 1000 1500 and 2000 in fig 15 the dimensionless cross sectional velocity which is defined as the ratio of the cross sectional velocity to the average inlet velocity u z a v g is employed for the comparison it can be clearly seen that the velocity profiles at the entrance of the blind tee section i e z 15d are the same at different reynolds numbers which follow the flow features of laminar flow and achieve a good agreement with the analytical solution according to the flow comparison downstream the blind tee section the unevenness of the velocity profile at y 2d becomes more and more severe with the increase of the reynolds number which promotes a better mixing condition of the fluid flow when re 500 the velocities are almost the same in the central part of y 5d it indicates that the mixing process of the downstream flow is finished around this location then as the fluid flows towards the downstream the velocity profile gradually changes into a parabolic shape at y 10d and 20d due to the influence of the viscosity it also can be observed that when the flow velocity increases the location where the mixing process is finished moves towards the downstream for re 1000 it appears to be y 10d for re 1500 it is in the range of y 15d to 20d while for re 2000 the fluid mixing still continues at 20d which is the outlet of the computational domain this observation is physically sound since a higher reynolds number implies a greater influence of the inertial force in the fluid thus the mixing process of the incoming flow with a higher inlet velocity needs a longer distance downstream the blind tee section by summarizing the findings for the four reynolds numbers analyzed in this paper the incoming laminar flow will generate 1 to 3 flow circulations in the blind tee section with b t l 5d a higher flow velocity and a blind tee length no more than 3d can achieve a better mixing condition for the fluid flow in blind tee pipes by increasing the strength of the first circulation and reducing the potential influence of stagnant flow in the blind tee section on the contrary a lower flow velocity with a longer btl will greatly increase the possibility of fluid deposition at the blind tee end however a longer distance of the downstream pipe is required for the fully mixing of the fluid flow with a higher reynolds number 5 conclusions laminar flows in blind tee pipes with the blind tee length varying from 1d to 5d at re 500 1000 1500 and 2000 have been investigated using three dimensional numerical simulations the main objective of the present research is to study the effects of the blind tee length the end structure shape of the blind tee section and the velocity of the incoming flow on the fluid mixing condition in blind tee pipes the flow characteristics are discussed by investigating the streamlines pressure contours and velocity profiles in the blind tees it is found that in the laminar flow regime the incoming fluid will form 1 to 3 flow circulations in the blind tee section with b t l 5d where the second and third flow circulations with low velocity have limited the fluid exchange with the flow in the main pipe with the increase of the blind tee length and the decrease of the inlet velocity more flow circulations are generated with a smaller size lower velocity and weaker strength leading to stagnant flow more prone to occur towards the blind tee end the maximum capability of the laminar flow to create the first flow circulation inside the blind tee section is limited to a size around 3d besides for the spherical and flat end structure shapes analyzed in this paper the major flow characteristics both inside and downstream the blind tee section remain unchanged the end structure shape only affects the flow details close to the blind tee section with b t l 3d the laminar flow characteristics reported in the present study reveal that a higher flow velocity and a blind tee length no more than 3d can achieve a better mixing condition for the fluid flow in blind tee pipes while blind tee pipes with b t l 3d at a low inlet velocity are more likely to increase the possibility of stagnant flow and the potential of fluid deposition at the blind tee end meanwhile a longer distance of the downstream pipe is required for the fully mixing of the fluid flow with a higher reynolds number for future research experimental data are required before a conclusion regarding the validity of this numerical approach can be given in the meantime this method would be a useful engineering tool for understanding the flow physics in blind tee pipes and can be used to estimate the mixing conditions downstream the blind tee section credit

21394,blind tee pipes are often employed in process piping systems used in offshore and subsea oil and gas industry the objective of the present study is to investigate the effects of blind tee length end structure shape and flow velocity on the mixing condition inside blind tee pipes three dimensional numerical simulations are performed for the laminar flows in the pipes with blind tee length varying from 1d to 5d at re 500 1000 1500 and 2000 spherical and flat end structure shapes are also investigated for the blind tee section firstly flow simulations in a straight pipe are performed and the numerical results are compared with the analytical solutions then the computed velocity profiles are used as the inlet velocity for the simulations of blind tee pipes flow characteristics both inside and downstream the blind tee section are numerically studied by analyzing the streamlines pressure contours and velocity profiles the results reveal that a higher inlet velocity and a blind tee length no more than 3d can achieve a better mixing condition for the fluid flow in blind tee pipes while stagnant flows are more prone to occur towards the end of the blind tee section at low velocities with the length longer than 3d leading to potential fluid deposition in blind tee pipes keywords laminar flow blind tee pipe flow mixing three dimensional simulation 1 introduction process piping systems in the offshore oil gas platforms and subsea production systems do not always have a straight pipe geometry the configurations of these pipelines are usually zigzag or snake like in order to provide a good layout flexibility in the limited space therefore the pipe fittings and joints such as elbows blind tees t junctions and y junctions are commonly adopted in these piping systems the fluid flow at the connections or joint parts of the pipelines behaves differently from the flow of fluid in a straight pipe as reported by humphrey et al 1985 soleimani 1999 and vasava 2007 this is especially true for the common multiphase flows encountered in the oil and gas industry since the phase separation deposition and flow mixing often occur at the bends and junctions the flow characteristics inside these connections need to be studied in order to allow for an appropriate flow engineering design first the potential for deposits inside the pipe joints should be checked as these may affect the internal flow patterns of the pipelines second it should be investigated whether the flow especially multiphase flow is well mixed when passing through the pipe fittings so that the measurements can be successfully implemented with relevant sensors e g particle concentration sensors according to the open literature many experimental analytical and numerical studies have been carried out to investigate single phase flows inside straight pipes curved pipes 90 elbows and t junctions at first velocity profiles and other characteristics of the laminar flow in straight pipes were solved according to the basic fluid equations hornbeck 1964 friedmann et al 1968 with the aid of measuring equipment and numerical simulation laufer 1954 and eggels et al 1994 analyzed the turbulent structures of fully developed pipe flow then the complicated flow patterns at bends and joints of the pipelines attracted more and more attention of the researchers the secondary motions of both the laminar and turbulent flows in 180 curved pipes were calculated and analyzed by patankar et al 1983 and shirayama and kuwahara 1987 jarrahi et al 2011 and kim et al 2014 studied the characteristics and mixing of the swirling flow induced by 90 elbow pipes for t junctions costa et al 2006 and beneš et al 2013 revealed the influences of the junction edge and cross section geometry on the pipe flow in addition various investigations have been performed to study the flow patterns inside subsea pipelines and solve the problems induced by multiphase flows for the offshore oil and gas productions such as the slug flows corrosions erosions and flow depositions reported by li et al 2018 pouraria et al 2016b holmedal et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 and wang et al 2015 with the aid of multiphase test facilities oil gas and oil water flows in vertical horizontal and hilly terrain pipelines were measured and new flow patterns were identified by abduvayt et al 2004 and akhiyarov et al 2010 pouraria et al 2016a developed a numerical model for the oil water flow in a subsea pipeline and successfully predicted the internal flow structures under different working conditions peng et al 2013 and liu et al 2015 discussed the flow characteristics of oil and gas products with solid particles in 90 elbow and t junction pipes baker et al 2007 and zhao et al 2017 measured the gas liquid flow at t junctions and elbows and proposed new strategies to control the relevant flow patterns and phase distributions among different geometric configurations of the offshore and subsea pipelines blind tees are the one common feature in the technologies of multiphase flow meters most of these meters available on the market require an upstream blind tee in order to achieve a specified metrology brister 2013 pinguet et al 2014a and the blind tee is also an ideal location for the sampling of multiphase flow in subsea pipelines pinguet et al 2014b in addition blind tees are usually used instead of standard elbows in industrial practice to reduce particle erosions in piping systems chen et al 2006 pouraria et al 2017 and duarte et al 2020 carried out numerical studies to access the relative erosions in blind tees and indicated that the erosion rate was significantly affected by the pipe diameter flow velocity and mass loading of the fluid therefore analyzing flow characteristics in blind tee pipes is important for evaluating the pressure loss mixing conditions particle erosions and depositions in multiphase flow metering a typical blind tee pipe is shown in fig 1 however detailed flow physics inside blind tee pipes has not yet been thoroughly investigated in the open literature to the authors knowledge only ong et al 2017 studied some configurations of blind tees at re 1000 there are many factors that may affect the flow characteristics inside blind tee pipes in multiphase flow metering a dispersed flow pattern is frequently observed the feature of this flow pattern is that it has a strong correlation with the primary phase i e oil or gas thus as the first step of the research on blind tee pipes this paper will focus on the single primary phase to analyze the basic flow characteristics in blind tees the main objective of the present study is to make a more general and in depth understanding of the physics associated with single phase flow in blind tee pipes with different configurations and a wide range of working conditions that have not been revealed in the previous studies the results and findings are expected to provide inspirations for relevant research on multiphase flows in blind tees such as the sand wax depositions flow corrosions erosions and the oil water gas water mixing conditions in this study the flow characteristics in blind tee pipes will be investigated under different lengths and end structure shapes of the blind tee section using three dimensional computational fluid dynamics cfd method although the mixing of flow in process systems is generally turbulent laminar flow problems do exist in some pipelines of oil and gas industry such as the specific pipe flow of waxy crude oil heavy oil and water in oil emulsions nazar et al 2005 keleşoğlu et al 2012 guo et al 2018 therefore in this paper the fluid mixing conditions in the blind tee pipes will be analyzed at reynolds numbers ranging from 500 to 2000 all of which are in laminar flow regime based on detailed flow patterns and pressure distributions along the pipes the effects of the blind tee length end structure shape and inlet velocity on the flow characteristics in blind tee pipes will be identified and a critical length of the blind tee section will be determined in order to avoid fluid deposition in the blind tees it could provide a useful engineering tool for understanding the flow physics in blind tee pipes and can be used to estimate the mixing conditions induced by the blind tees 2 methodology since there is no available flow data for blind tee pipes this study will firstly simulate the three dimensional flow in a straight pipe and verify the numerical results against the analytical solutions given in cengel and cimbala 2014 subsequently the pipe flow with the verified incoming velocity profile will be set at the inlet of the blind tee pipes with blind tee lengths varying from 1d to 5d here d is the pipe diameter the corresponding flow characteristics will be studied in the blind tee pipes with two different end structure shapes i e spherical end and flat end at re 500 1000 1500 and 2000 2 1 numerical method the objective of the present numerical simulation is to solve the three dimensional incompressible navier stokes equations for the single phase laminar flow of a newtonian fluid since the working fluid in this paper is incompressible the density of the fluid does not change with the time and spatial position therefore the governing equations include the continuity and momentum equations which can be written as 1 u 0 2 u t u u 1 ρ p ν δ u where ρ and ν respectively represent the density and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid u represents the velocity vector of the fluid flow and p is the static pressure the commercial cfd software ansys cfx which is widely used for a variety of flows in the ocean engineering has been adopted for the numerical simulations in the present study it employs a pressure based coupled solver using time implicit algorithm and applies a three dimensional element based finite volume method for the solution of navier stokes equations raw 1985 a high resolution advection scheme is used for the spatial discretization and a second order backward euler approach is employed for the transient terms ansys cfx solver guide 2012 2 2 computational model the computational domains boundaries and geometrical parameters for the straight pipe and the blind tee pipes are shown in fig 2 the corresponding boundary conditions are specified as follows a inlet according to the classical formula given in cengel and cimbala 2014 the fully developed velocity profile for the laminar pipe flow can be analytically described as 3 u z r 2 u z a v g 1 r 2 r 2 where u z a v g is the average inlet flow velocity r is the radius of the pipe and r is the radial distance from the pipe center in order to reduce the time consumption of the numerical simulations and avoid using very large computational domains the analytical velocity profile obtained by eq 3 is set as the inlet boundary condition there are five different reynolds numbers re u z a v g d ν investigated in this paper where d 1 m and ν 0 001 m2 s thus for the flow simulation at each reynolds number the velocity profile is computed with the corresponding average inlet velocity u z a v g e g u z a v g 1 m s for the case of re 1000 the pressure boundary condition is also set at the inlet with zero normal gradient b outlet for the outlet the velocity boundary condition is set as zero normal gradient and the pressure boundary condition is set to be zero c wall on the internal walls of the pipe i e the solid walls of the computational domain a non slip boundary condition is prescribed and the pressure boundary condition is set as zero normal gradient in order to make sure the final steady solutions are obtained for the flow analysis in blind tee pipes the total simulation times at re 500 1000 1500 and 2000 in the present work are set as 40s 20s 14s and 10s respectively which are over twice the amount of time required to achieve stabilized solutions when the rms residuals stay lower than 10 5 and the residuals of mass conservation are not more than 10 3 the numerical simulations are considered to have converged 3 validation of cfd method in order to validate the accuracy of the cfd method used in the present study three dimensional numerical simulations have been performed to compute the flow in a straight pipe with the pipe diameter d 1 m and the pipe length l 10 d at re 500 1000 1500 and 2000 the corresponding average inlet velocities for these computational flow conditions are u z a v g 0 5 m s 1 m s 1 5 m s and 2 m s respectively the grid and time step convergence studies are presented in this section and the numerical results of the flow velocity profiles are verified against the analytical solutions a grid convergence study is carried out with m e s h 1 5544 elements m e s h 2 11 718 elements m e s h 3 20992 elements and m e s h 4 42 840 elements at different reynolds numbers as well as the maximum courant number m c n 0 1 all the computational meshes were generated using ansys icem cfd with multi block structured grids the predicted cross sectional velocity profiles u z of these meshes at re 1000 are shown in fig 3 a with respect to the dimensionless radial position r d from 0 5 to 0 5 at the location of z 5 d it is observed that the numerical results change greatly with the increase of the grid number when the mesh is less than 20 992 elements compared to the results obtained by mesh 3 the maximum deviations of the velocity profiles in mesh 1 and mesh 2 are 3 19 and 2 31 respectively moreover the averaged velocity deviations across the section are 1 34 and 0 99 respectively when the grid number increases to more than 20 992 elements the maximum difference between the computational velocity profiles in mesh 3 and mesh 4 decreases to 0 92 and the corresponding average difference across the whole section decreases to only 0 41 therefore according to the comparison it can be found that mesh 3 with 20 992 elements provides sufficient numerical accuracy for the straight pipe case subsequently a time step convergence study has been performed for mesh 3 20 992 elements with three different maximum courant numbers i e m c n 0 1 0 3 and 1 the result of the time step convergence study is given in fig 3 b which appears that the maximum courant number m c n 0 3 is found to be sufficiently accurate for the present numerical simulation for the validation of these computational results the analytical solutions are employed to make a comparison with the corresponding numerical velocity profiles obtained by mesh 3 with m c n 0 3 the comparisons as shown in fig 4 are performed for all the reynolds numbers analyzed in this paper it can be found that the predicted velocity profiles are in good agreement with the analytical solutions at different reynolds numbers which proves that the mesh with 20 992 elements mesh 3 using the maximum courant number m c n 0 3 achieves sufficient accuracy for the numerical simulations of laminar pipe flow in the present study 4 results and discussions the flow prediction for the straight pipe case discussed in section 3 presents an approach to achieve a fully developed laminar pipe flow which can be utilized for simulating the flow physics in blind tee pipes the fully developed velocity profiles obtained from the straight pipe case are set as the inlet velocity profiles for the blind tee pipes at re 500 1000 1500 and 2000 respectively numerical simulations of the three dimensional flows in blind tee pipes with five different blind tee lengths i e b t l 1d 2d 3d 4d and 5d and two different end structure shapes i e spherical end and flat end are performed in the present study the main objective is to investigate numerically how the increments of the blind tee length and the flow velocity affect the fluid mixing inside the blind tee pipes and analyze the effects of the spherical and flat end shapes on the pipe flow for the convenience of the discussion all the computational cases of the blind tee pipes in this paper are named with the blind tee length i e btl1 to btl5 respectively represent b t l 1d to 5d the end structure shape of the blind tee section i e s and f respectively represent the spherical end and the flat end and the corresponding reynolds number thus case btl3 s re1000 represents the numerical simulation of the blind tee pipe with b t l 3d and a spherical end at re 1000 4 1 grid resolution test grid resolution tests have been performed for all the computational cases here case btl3 s re1000 is provided as an instance for the comparison of the numerical results obtained using three different grid resolutions with the maximum courant number m c n 0 3 mesh 1 mesh 2 and mesh 3 for the whole blind tee pipe contain 67 476 elements 143 324 elements and 285 653 elements respectively and the grid numbers specifically for the blind tee section are 12 224 25 760 and 52 736 respectively fig 5 a shows the major locations where the velocity profiles are extracted for the flow analysis of blind tee pipes and the grid details of the blind tee section are presented in fig 5 b and c as shown in fig 6 the cross sectional velocity profiles at the locations of z 15d and y 20d in the symmetrical plane i e the y o z plane and the flow patterns inside the blind tee section are employed to make a qualitative and quantitative comparison for the grid resolution test it is clearly seen that both the velocity profiles and the flow details in the numerical results of mesh 2 with 143 324 elements and mesh 3 with 285 653 elements are very close to each other according to fig 6 a the maximum difference between the results of mesh 2 and mesh 3 is 1 52 and the average difference is only 0 78 even at the location downstream the blind tee i e y 20d when the grid resolution decreases to mesh 1 with 67 476 elements both the maximum and average differences in the velocity profiles greatly increase to more than 5 compared to the results of mesh 2 in addition both the flow details obtained with mesh 2 and mesh 3 in fig 6 b indicate that there are two main flow vortices inside the blind tee section in case btl3 s re1000 where the distributions of the velocity contours and vectors agree well with each other however only one main vortex can be observed in this region in the result of mesh 1 the velocity distribution and vortex location of which are quite different from that of mesh 2 and mesh 3 therefore mesh 2 with 143 324 elements is considered to have sufficient grid resolution which also achieves a good agreement with the analytical solution of the fully developed laminar pipe flow at the entrance of the blind tee section 4 2 effect of blind tee length in order to figure out the effect of the blind tee length on the flow physics in blind tee pipes three dimensional laminar flow simulations at different reynolds numbers have been carried out for the blind tee pipes with b t l 1d to 5d fig 7 shows the streamlines on the symmetrical plane for case btl3 s re1000 and the corresponding cross sectional velocity profiles at the selected locations i e z 15d y 2d y 5d y 10d and y 20d as presented in fig 5 are also displayed together with the velocity profile at the inlet the analytical solution it is clearly seen that the fully developed laminar incoming flow which is obtained and verified in the straight pipe case extends towards the blind tee section until z 15d then flow circulations and vortices are generated due to the existence of the blind tee section and the 90 bend as a consequence the cross sectional velocity profiles at y 2d to 10d do not exhibit a parabolic shape which is quite different from the velocity profile at z 15d as shown in fig 7 b it also gives some insight into the mixing process of the fluid flow downstream the blind tee section at y 2d dramatical changes of the cross sectional velocities are induced by the flow circulations and vortices it reports a significant influence of the blind tee section on the downstream flow pattern which promotes the mixing of the fully developed incoming flow then the distribution of the velocity profile becomes more and more uniform in the range of y 5d to 10d it proves a fully mixing process of the pipe flow and provides a good choice for the sampling locations of relevant flow meters finally the cross sectional velocity profile gradually got back to a parabolic shape along the pipe as shown at y 20d three dimensional streamlines in the blind tee pipes with b t l 1d to 5d at re 1000 are given in fig 8 a e which are colored by the dimensionless velocity u u z a v g ranging for 0 to 2 here u is the magnitude of the flow velocity by plotting the three dimensional streamlines the behavior of how the fluid is flowing inside the investigated pipes especially the blind tee section can be observed more clearly it shows that all the streams coming from the inlet keep a straight line when arriving at the entrance of the blind tee section some of the fluid directly flows towards the outlet by a 90 turning and the rest of the fluid flows towards the blind tee section since the end of the blind tee section is blanked off the fluid is trapped in this part as a result when the fluid hits the blanked off end it flows back and generates flow circulations and vortices not only in the blind tee section but also in the downstream main pipe it is observed that the flow circulations inside the blind tee sections are of different sizes which are influenced by the blind tee length the sizes of flow circulations in blind tees shown in fig 8 are determined as follows firstly the three dimensional streamlines are used to observe the basic structures of flow circulations in the blind tee section then the swirling strength and velocity profile on the cross section are extracted and analyzed in every distance along the flow direction since these parameters will greatly decrease at the edge of a vortex finally an approximate size can be estimated in order to provide a more intuitive understanding of the sizes and patterns of flow circulations in the blind tee section in case btl1 s re1000 and case btl2 s re1000 the approximate sizes of the flow circulations in the blind tee section are 1d and 2d respectively it reveals that for the blind tee pipes with b t l 1d and 2d there is only one flow circulation existing in the blind tee section the size of which equals to the corresponding blind tee length when the btl increases to 3d a second flow circulation begins to appear in the blind tee section for case btl3 s re1000 the approximate size of the first flow circulation is around 2 5d in this particular blind tee pipe meanwhile a vague shape of the second flow circulation is formed with a size around 0 5d as shown in fig 8 c even though it is influenced and involved by the first circulation as the btl continues to increase two flow circulations can be clearly seen in the blind tee pipe with b t l 4d the first circulation has a size around 2 5d and the size of the second one is about 1 5d the second flow circulation with a lower velocity can be taken as a stagnant flow circulation since the fluid exchange between this circulation and the flow in the main pipe is observed to be limited fig 8 e shows that there are three flow circulations existing in the blind tee pipe with b t l 5d the first two circulations still have a size around 2 5d and 1 5d respectively and the third one shows up with an approximate size of 1d however the velocity of the third flow circulation is quite low indicating that the fluid flow there becomes almost fully stagnant generally for the flow condition of re 1000 it can be concluded that the fluid which is trapped inside the blind tee section with b t l 3d only forms one flow circulation while for b t l 3d more than one flow circulation is generated it appears that the maximum capability of the fluid to create the first flow circulation inside the blind tee section is limited to a size around 2 5d the maximum size of the next flow circulation is about 1 5d which is smaller than that of the first one it reveals that the flow becomes weaker when it travels towards the end of the blind tee section which is physically sound pressure contours for the five computational cases of blind tee pipes are shown in fig 9 the dimensionless pressure which is defined as 2 p ρ u z a v g 2 is employed for the comparison it can be clearly seen that the pressure in the blind tee section increases with the increase of the blind tee length implying that stagnant fluid with lower velocity is more prone to occur in the blind tee pipe with a longer blind tee section this observation is consistent with the flow characteristics reported by the streamlines in fig 8 for the mixing condition of the flow downstream the blind tee section fig 10 displays the velocity contours and vectors on the sections of y 2d 5d and 10d it can be seen that the strength of the swirling flow in the downstream main pipe also depends on the blind tee length in case btl1 s re1000 there is only one main swirling flow existing in the downstream pipe when the length of the blind tee section increases two flow vortices appear in the blind tee pipes with b t l 2d to 5d see fig 10 b e the corresponding velocity distributions at y 5d and 10d are observed to be more uniform than that of the case with b t l 1d it indicates that compared to the one swirling flow generated by the blind tee section with 1d length the two flow vortices created by a longer blind tee section promote a better mixing of the fluid inside the blind tee pipes however when the btl is longer than 3d the unevenness of the velocity distributions at y 5d and 10d turns to be greater since the strength of the flow vortices becomes weaker in the blind tee pipes with b t l 4d and 5d by summarizing the aforementioned findings for re 1000 analyzed in this section the blind tee pipes with btl in the range of 2d to 3d can achieve a better mixing condition of the laminar pipe flow by generating flow circulations and vortices with proper sizes numbers and strength in both the blind tee section and the downstream pipe for b t l 3d flow circulations with lower velocity are generated which may lead to stagnant fluid and potential depositions i e bad fluid mixing condition towards the blind tee end while for b t l 2d only one main swirling flow is not enough for the fully mixing of the laminar pipe flow 4 3 effect of blind tee end structure shape two different end structure shapes of the blind tee section i e spherical end and flat end have been investigated in the present study as a comparison for the blind tee pipes with spherical end in fig 8 three dimensional streamlines for the blind tee pipes with flat end at re 1000 are given in fig 11 in the flat end cases it also can be found that only one main flow circulation occurs in the blind tee section when b t l 1d and 2d as the btl increases a second flow circulation forms in case btl3 f re1000 and case btl4 f re1000 and a third circulation is observed in case btl5 f re1000 for the pipes with the same btl the numbers and approximate sizes of the flow circulations in the flat blind tee section appear to be consistent with that of the spherical blind tee section however different from the spherical end flow vortices with very small sizes are induced by the rectangular junction of the flat end and the cylindrical wall as marked with dash circles in fig 11 a and b these small vortices can be also treated as stagnant flow since the corresponding velocities are quite low they will increase the deposition possibility of multiphase flows at the end of the blind tee section especially for blind tee pipes with b t l 3d with the increase of the blind tee length the small vortices are gradually merged in the second or third flow circulation as presented in fig 11 c e in order to analysis the effect of different end structure shapes on the fluid flow downstream the blind tee section a comparison has been made for blind tee pipes with b t l 1d to 5d in fig 12 it shows the trends of how the average velocities on different downstream sections i e y 2d 5d and 10d change with the increase of the btl in the two end structure shapes according to the comparison it can be seen that the trends of the average velocities in the blind tee pipes with flat end are consistent with that of the pipes with spherical end it indicates that for both the flat and spherical end shapes the major flow characteristics downstream the blind tee section remain unchanged according to the details of the comparison the velocities at y 2d in the spherical end cases are greater than that of the corresponding cases with flat end the velocity differences between the two end shapes become smaller at y 5d and 10d it reveals that the influence of the end structure shape mainly affects the flow near the blind tee section which is gradually reduced and disappears along the downstream pipe meanwhile when the b t l 5d flow velocities in different end structures are almost the same it means that there is insignificant effect of the end structure shape on the internal flow of blind tee pipes when the blind tee section is long enough to sum up for the particular end structure shapes analyzed in the present study the major flow characteristics both inside and downstream the blind tee section stay the same the end structure shape only affects the flow details close to the blind tee section for b t l 3d small flow vortices are generated at the flat end leading to more stagnant fluid in the blind tee section when b t l 3d the influences of different end shapes become weaker which almost disappears in the blind tee pipe with b t l 5d 4 4 effect of flow velocity in this section the effect of the flow velocity in blind tee pipes will be analyzed using the dimensionless reynolds numbers numerical simulations have been carried out at four different reynolds numbers in laminar flow regime i e re 500 1000 1500 and 2000 and the corresponding average velocities of the inlet flow are u z avg 0 5 m s 1 m s 1 5 m s and 2 m s respectively according to section 4 2 the blind tee pipe with b t l 5d provides the most flow information of the circulations in the blind tee section which is a good choice for analyzing the flow characteristics under different reynolds numbers therefore in this section the cfd cases with b t l 5d are investigated in order to figure out the effect of flow velocity on the internal flow of blind tee pipes streamlines in the blind tee pipe with b t l 5d at the four reynolds numbers are shown in fig 13 it can be clearly seen that for the same blind tee pipe the flow pattern inside the blind tee section varies with the reynolds number including the sizes and numbers of the flow circulations at the condition of re 500 there are three flow circulations existing in the blind tee section see fig 13 a it is observed that the approximate sizes of the first two circulations are respectively 2 2d and 1 3d for the third circulation although it has a size around 1 5d the velocity there is quite low leading to a fully stagnant flow at the end of the blind tee section with the increase of the flow velocity the first two circulations in the 5d blind tee section become larger with a higher velocity as shown in fig 13 b d as a consequence the third flow circulation turns to be smaller and gradually disappeared together with the influence of the stagnant flow at the blind tee end when the flow velocity increases to re 2000 only two flow circulations can be observed in the blind tee section the sizes of which reach up to around 3d and 2d respectively it reveals that the incoming flow with a higher inlet velocity can reduce the potential of stagnant flow in the blind tee section and achieve a better mixing condition inside the blind tee pipe in general for the blind tee pipe with b t l 5d it can be concluded that the fluid trapped inside the blind tee section can form three flow circulations when re 1500 while when re 2000 only two flow circulations are generated it also appears that the maximum capability of the laminar flow to create the first flow circulation inside the blind tee section is limited to a size around 3d the maximum size of the first circulation varies from 2 2d to 3d when the reynolds number changes in the range of 500 2000 it suggests that the length of the blind tee section should be no more than 3d which could effectively avoid the potential flow deposition at the end of the blind tee section induced by the second or third flow circulation pressure contours for the blind tee pipe with b t l 5d at different reynolds numbers are displayed in fig 14 from the comparison of the pressure contours in the four cases it can be seen that the dimensionless pressure in the blind tee section decreases with the increase of the flow velocity it means that fewer stagnant fluid occurs in the blind tee section with a higher inlet flow velocity which is consistent with the flow characteristics revealed by the streamlines in fig 13 in order to analyze the effect of inlet velocity on the flow pattern downstream the blind tee section cross sectional velocity profiles at the selected locations i e z 15d y 2d y 5d y 10d and y 20d on the symmetrical plane of the blind tee pipe are compared at re 500 1000 1500 and 2000 in fig 15 the dimensionless cross sectional velocity which is defined as the ratio of the cross sectional velocity to the average inlet velocity u z a v g is employed for the comparison it can be clearly seen that the velocity profiles at the entrance of the blind tee section i e z 15d are the same at different reynolds numbers which follow the flow features of laminar flow and achieve a good agreement with the analytical solution according to the flow comparison downstream the blind tee section the unevenness of the velocity profile at y 2d becomes more and more severe with the increase of the reynolds number which promotes a better mixing condition of the fluid flow when re 500 the velocities are almost the same in the central part of y 5d it indicates that the mixing process of the downstream flow is finished around this location then as the fluid flows towards the downstream the velocity profile gradually changes into a parabolic shape at y 10d and 20d due to the influence of the viscosity it also can be observed that when the flow velocity increases the location where the mixing process is finished moves towards the downstream for re 1000 it appears to be y 10d for re 1500 it is in the range of y 15d to 20d while for re 2000 the fluid mixing still continues at 20d which is the outlet of the computational domain this observation is physically sound since a higher reynolds number implies a greater influence of the inertial force in the fluid thus the mixing process of the incoming flow with a higher inlet velocity needs a longer distance downstream the blind tee section by summarizing the findings for the four reynolds numbers analyzed in this paper the incoming laminar flow will generate 1 to 3 flow circulations in the blind tee section with b t l 5d a higher flow velocity and a blind tee length no more than 3d can achieve a better mixing condition for the fluid flow in blind tee pipes by increasing the strength of the first circulation and reducing the potential influence of stagnant flow in the blind tee section on the contrary a lower flow velocity with a longer btl will greatly increase the possibility of fluid deposition at the blind tee end however a longer distance of the downstream pipe is required for the fully mixing of the fluid flow with a higher reynolds number 5 conclusions laminar flows in blind tee pipes with the blind tee length varying from 1d to 5d at re 500 1000 1500 and 2000 have been investigated using three dimensional numerical simulations the main objective of the present research is to study the effects of the blind tee length the end structure shape of the blind tee section and the velocity of the incoming flow on the fluid mixing condition in blind tee pipes the flow characteristics are discussed by investigating the streamlines pressure contours and velocity profiles in the blind tees it is found that in the laminar flow regime the incoming fluid will form 1 to 3 flow circulations in the blind tee section with b t l 5d where the second and third flow circulations with low velocity have limited the fluid exchange with the flow in the main pipe with the increase of the blind tee length and the decrease of the inlet velocity more flow circulations are generated with a smaller size lower velocity and weaker strength leading to stagnant flow more prone to occur towards the blind tee end the maximum capability of the laminar flow to create the first flow circulation inside the blind tee section is limited to a size around 3d besides for the spherical and flat end structure shapes analyzed in this paper the major flow characteristics both inside and downstream the blind tee section remain unchanged the end structure shape only affects the flow details close to the blind tee section with b t l 3d the laminar flow characteristics reported in the present study reveal that a higher flow velocity and a blind tee length no more than 3d can achieve a better mixing condition for the fluid flow in blind tee pipes while blind tee pipes with b t l 3d at a low inlet velocity are more likely to increase the possibility of stagnant flow and the potential of fluid deposition at the blind tee end meanwhile a longer distance of the downstream pipe is required for the fully mixing of the fluid flow with a higher reynolds number for future research experimental data are required before a conclusion regarding the validity of this numerical approach can be given in the meantime this method would be a useful engineering tool for understanding the flow physics in blind tee pipes and can be used to estimate the mixing conditions downstream the blind tee section credit
