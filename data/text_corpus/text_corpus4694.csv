human beings to explore the underwater regions conventional propeller propulsion system for underwater vehicles shows the drawbacks of high hydro acoustic noise and vibration serious flow induced erosion and low efficiency when the rotational speed of impeller increases to a certain extent nwaoha et al 2017 the underwater vehicles equipped with waterjet propulsion system have some distinct advantages such as excellent maneuverability little cavitation and low noise operation etc cai and zhou 2012 korde 2004 as shown in widely studied and used in shipping field oh et al 2003 park et al 2005a 2005b gao et al 2008 recently a novel high pressure waterjet propulsion system was proposed and applied to underwater vehicles huang et al 2009 shi zhaocun et al 2013 yang et al 2007 low pressure water was sucked in and pressurized to become high pressure water stream by the water positive displacement piston pump and then the high pressure water was converted into high speed waterjet via nozzles to generate reaction thrust for underwater vehicles the recent researches about high pressure waterjet propulsion mainly forced on the thrust performances shi zhaocun et al 2013 studied the influence of nozzle geometry parameters on the thrust performance through simulations and experiments the thrust performances of conical nozzle cylindrical nozzle and optimized streamlined nozzle were compared with each other and the streamlined nozzle was considered to possess the best performance yang et al 2014 jian et al 2016 presented a numerical investigation into four different nozzles

rate were analyzed through computational fluid dynamics zhang et al 2017 studied the thrust performance of high pressure waterjet propulsion through simulation and experiments taking into consideration the effect of cavitation maneuverability is a critical characteristic for underwater vehicles utilizing multiply additional thrusters is a good method to maneuvering the direction of underwater vehicles new adaptive hybrid propulsion combining with waterjet propulsion vector propulsion and glide propulsion together was proposed which effectively improved the flexibility and precise location capability of underwater vehicles zheng et al 2010 four servomotors were adopted to control the directions of four water jet propellers which actuated the underwater vehicles to realize the forward backward rotating floating and sinking motions guo et al 2010 2012 lin and guo 2012 and li et al 2015 compared with screw propellers undulatory and oscillatory propulsion with lower environmental disturbance can also achieve high efficiency and maneuverability clark et al 2008 inspired from the propulsion of cephalopods and jellyfish pulsatile vortex ring generator was used to produce waterjet and driven underwater vehicles demont and gosline 1988a b c mohseni 2006 and krieg et al 2005 2008 used pulsatile vortex ring generators on a torpedo shaped underwater vehicle to provide the precise low speed maneuvering necessary at a work site in combination with the low drag characteristics which allows for high speed long distance travel by placing four pulsatile vortex ring generators near the corners of the vehicle very precise control of the vehicle can be obtained indeed orientating the thrust direction is another important approach to maneuvering the underwater vehicles especially for waterjet propulsion system which is very different from a conventional fin maneuvered auv le page et al 2000a b a very low thrust from a zero speed state is enough to maneuver the vehicle this is a noneligible parameter for docking purposes shallow water maneuverability etc cavallo et al 2004 investigated a new concept autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with vectored thrusters which is capable to orientate both the propeller and the stabilizing tail fins through three degrees of freedom spherical parallel mechanism lazic and ristanovic 2007 used two linear hydraulic servo actuators to establish a tvcs each servo actuator was controlled by a two stage electrohydraulic servo valve the position feedback was provided by measuring the actual thrust vector direction by the angular transducers mounted in the axes of the gimbal s universal joint instead of measuring the displacements of the servo actuators the thrust vector direction was the result of the motions of both servo actuators and a linear model of the servo system was developed and simulated since the vectored thruster system was highly nonlinear a fuzzy sliding mode controller had been developed for control purposes le page and holappa 2010a b a novel adaptive control law for the end effector tracking problem of underwater vehicle manipulator systems uvmss was presented antonelli et al 2004 by use of the high pressure waterjet propulsion system equipped with a vectored thrust system the maneuverability of underwater vehicles could be effectively improved xin et al 2013 liu et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 combining the high pressure waterjet propulsion system with tvcs and applying it on underwater vehicles has been rarely mentioned in literature in this paper the maneuvering performance of underwater vehicles equipped with high pressure waterjet propulsion system and tvcs was researched the tvcs was a 3rps parallel manipulator which mainly consisted of three water hydraulic cylinders and each cylinder was controlled through a proportional directional valve the deflection angle of the nozzle and waterjet was the resultant motions of the three water cylinders instead of rudders and sterns the sailing trajectory of this underwater vehicle can be controlled by adjusting the waterjet direction and thrust vector even at low speed conditions the maneuverability of this underwater vehicle especially in low speed conditions was obviously improved in comparison with conventional propellers the thrust performance of high pressure waterjet propulsion was studied and the force analysis and dynamics of the underwater vehicle were theoretically researched moreover a 3rps parallel manipulator was built and the position feedback was achieved by measuring the displacements of the cylinders in addition the relationship between the thrust direction and the displacements of the three water cylinders was established through the procedure of solving an inverse kinematics problem besides the motion transformation function of the valve controlled cylinder system was derived and the simulink model was built accordingly due to the asymmetric characteristic of the valve controlled cylinder system the fuzzy pid controller strategy was adopted and its performance was researched in comparison with the conventional pid controller and null controller especially the parameters were specified and the sailing trajectory was obtained and analyzed the maneuverability of underwater vehicles equipped with high pressure water jet propulsion and tvcs was evaluated 2 underwater vehicle the high pressure waterjet propulsion system mainly consists of an inlet port a water positive displacement piston pump and a nozzle as shown in fig 1 the water positive displacement piston pump firstly sucks in low pressure water through the inlet hose and then pressurizes the water to become high pressure stream when the stream with high pressure energy is delivered to the nozzle through the high pressure hose a high speed water jet forms and sprays out of the nozzle with the sprays of the high speed water jet the reaction thrust generates and the vehicles are driven forward since the pressure energy of the working medium is delivered through the flexible high pressure hose the connection between the nozzle and the water hydraulic piston pump is very flexible this flexible characteristic is beneficial to applying the tvcs to adjusting the water jet angle conveniently the direction of underwater vehicles can be controlled by the tvcs instead of rudders and sterns so the maneuverability of underwater vehicles is effectively improved by use of high pressure waterjet propulsion system equipped with a tvcs xin et al 2013 liu et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 the thrust f n is the reaction force created by the high speed water jet leaving from the nozzle according to the momentum conservation equation the thrust can be expressed as 1 f n m out v out m in v in a out p out d a out a in p in d a in where m and v represent the mass flow rate and velocity of water jet respectively p is pressure and a represents the cross section area the subscript

a out 2 δ p ρ out where the flow coefficient c d can be written as 4 c d m out a out 2 ρ out δ p neglecting the influences of inlet velocity v in and the inlet pressure p in the thrust can be given by 5 f n 1 2 c d 2 δ p a out in order to analyze the force characteristic of underwater vehicle equipped with tvcs a three dimensional cartesian coordinate system b xbybzb is built as shown in fig 2 its origin coincides with the buoyant center b the xb axis coincides with the geometry center axis of the underwater vehicles the yb axis is vertical upwards and the zb axis is perpendicular to the paper n is the center point of the nozzle outlet which is considered as the force generation point in addition the direction of the reaction force is controlled by the tvcs the deflection angle can be adjusted at the range of 30 30 on the plane of b xbyb and b xbzb α is the angle between the thrust vector f n and the plane of b xbzb β is the angle between xb axis and the projection of f n on the plane of b xbzb α and β are the two tilt angles that take responsibilities for adjusting the pitch and yaw motions respectively generally the reaction force f n can be decomposed into three components along the coordinate axis 6 f x f n cos α cos β f y f n sin α f z f n cos α sin β at the same time the force moments with respect to the coordinate axis of b xbybzb can be expressed 7 m x 0 m y f z nb m z f y nb where nb is the vector from the nozzle center n to the buoyant center b in addition the hydrodynamic model of the underwater vehicles can be further derived according to the momentum theorem and the moment of momentum theorem hu et al 2015 8 d q d t ω q f d κ d t ω k v b q m where f and m respectively denote the resultants of all external force and force moment acted on the

center to the buoyant center v b is the velocity of buoyant center j b i x i y i z is the inertia moment of underwater vehicle with respect to the coordinate axis b xbybzb the maneuverability of horizontal motion is attributed to the yaw angle which is controlled through deflecting the nozzle angle on horizontal plane that is α 0 the dynamic equation can be simplified on horizontal plane hu

sideslip angle and angular speed c my β b and c my ω y represent the rotation derivative of yaw moment with respect to the sideslip angle and angular speed moreover the values of parameters are listed in table 1 3 the thrust vector control system the navigation trajectory of underwater vehicle is governed by the tvcs in terms of the structure the tvcs is essentially a 3rps parallel manipulator as shown in fig 3 this parallel mechanism mainly consists of a mobile plate a fixed base plate and three water hydraulic cylinder systems the motion transmission of this parallel mechanism is realized through the three sets of revolute joints spherical joints and prismatic joints the working process of this tvcs is shown in fig 4 the objective deflection angle of the nozzle is as the inputs and then the necessary displacement of each cylinder is derived through inverse kinematic the position of water cylinders are controlled by the water proportional directional valves according to the results of inverse kinematic consequently the specified deflection angle is obtained the extension and retraction motions of the three water cylinders make the mobile plate have different deflection angles so the direction of reaction force and the azimuth of underwater vehicle are regulated accordingly in order to accomplish the inverse kinematic analysis and establish the relationship between the nozzle deflection angle and the positions of the three water cylinders a fixed and a moved three dimension cartesian coordinate system are established namely oa xayaza and on xnynzn as shown in fig 5 the origin of the fixed coordinate system oa xayaza coincides with the fixed base plate geometric center and the x axis coincides with the center axis of the underwater vehicle the moved coordinate system locates on the mobile plate assuming the radius of the top mobile plate is r and the spherical joints on the mobile plate are noted by n 1 n 2 and n 3 therefore the coordinate of the spherical joints in the moving coordinate system can be expressed 11 p n csn n 1 n 2 n 3 0 0 0 r r 2 r 2 0 3 r 2 3 r 2 similarly assuming the radius of the fixed base plates is r and the revolute joints on the base plate are noted by a 1 a 2 and a 3 their locations in the fixed coordinate system can be given by matrix 12 p a csa a 1 a 2 a 3 0 0 0 r r 2 r 2 0 3 r 2 3 r 2 as mentioned above α and β are the two tilt angles which determine the pitch and yaw of the underwater vehicle respectively the transformation matrix from the moving coordinate to the fix coordinate could be given by 13 c a n cos β cos α cos β sin α sin β sin α cos α 0 sin β cos α sin β sin α cos β the transformation matrix c a n is the result of two subsequent principal rotations the first is about zn axis by α and the second is about yn axis by β therefore the coordinates of spherical joints n 1 n 2 and n 3 could be described in the fix coordinate system and the coordinate of o n in the fix coordinate system is 0 0 h then the displacement variation of each water cylinder can be derived as 14 δ l c a n p n csn p a csa l o where l o is the original length vector of the cylinder δ l is the displacement variation of the cylinders in addition the force exerted on the each actuator cylinder can be derived according to space force system 15 t f l 1 f l 2 f l 3 0 where t is vector thrust force generated by the high pressure water jet propulsion f l1 f l2 and f l3 are the vector force exerted on the actuator cylinders assigning values to r r and h with 200 mm 100 mm and 400 mm the displacement of each cylinder with respect to the tilt angle α and β are derived and depicted in fig 6 it is clear that the plotting is symmetrical about the plane of β 0 rad and the displacement of cylinder 1 mainly relates to the tilt angle α the position of cylinder 2 and 3 mainly relates to the tilt angle β due to the specific location and orientation of the coordinate systems supposing the thrust force is 9000 n the load distribution of each actuator cylinder with respect to the nozzle deflection angle is shown in fig 7 the negative force is point to stress and the positive force represents tension it clearly shows that the cylinders do not always sustain stress and the cylinders would sustain tension under some conditions to make the tvcs reach to force balance like the displacement plotting of cylinders the force plotting is also symmetrical about the plane of β 0 rad and the force of cylinder 1 mainly relates to the tilt angle α the force of cylinder 2 and 3 mainly relates to the tilt angle β 4 water valve control water cylinder model in terms of control system the tvcs is a water proportional directional valve controlled asymmetric water cylinder system the schematic diagram is shown in fig 8 and the asymmetric characteristic of the cylinder makes its extension motion performance different from that of its retraction movement in order to implement such control and evaluate its performance a reliable yet simple dynamic model for cylinder motion is necessary then the load pressure p l and load flow q l is simplified and redefined as follow dan et al 2010 dong et al 2010 song et al 2015 16 p l f a 1 p 1 n p 2 q l q 1 n q 2 1 n 2 where p 1 and p 2 are the working pressure of piston chamber and rod chamber respectively q 1 and q 2 represent the flow rate within the piston side and rode side a 1 and a 2 represent the effective working areas of the piston side and rod side and n is the area ratio of the chambers which is determined as n a 2 a 1 according to the orifice flow equation the volume flow of piston chamber and rod chamber are obtained when the cylinder extends out y 0 and x v 0 17 q 1 c d w x v 2 p s p 1 ρ q 2 c d w x v 2 p 2 ρ where c d is the

leakage coefficient of the water cylinder assuming the initial volume of the piston chamber and rod chamber is v 10 v 20 v t 2 and neglecting the displacement of the rod the load flow equation can be obtained 21 q l q 1 n q 2 1 n 2 a 1 d y d t v t 2 1 n 2 β c d p l d t c tc p l c tc0 p s where c tc0 n 2 n 2 1 n 2 1 n 3 1 c ic and c tc n 1 n 3 1 c ic c ec n 2 1 at the same time the force

the proportional valve is 2m23bnsw produced by waterhydraulic co ltd the type of amplifier is wandfluh p02 whose maximum output current is 1 15 a and the corresponding maximum spool displacement is 4

displacement gain coefficient k sv 3 28 10 4 m a the valve nature frequency ω v 16 rad s the valve damping ratio δ v 0 6 the proportional amplifier is a voltage current converter with higher output impedance and wider frequency bandwidth it can be simplified as a proportional element 27 i s u s k a 0 2 a v the water hydraulic cylinder is designed and manufactured by ourselves as shown in fig 9 a built in magnetostrictive displacement transducer tdm lpa1 150m1c3 wo with the measuring range of 0 150 mm is integrated in the cylinder rod to detect the displacement the displacement transducer mainly consists of a magnetic ring and a measure rod the magnetic ring is mounted on the cylinder rod the measure rod is fixed on the cylinder and it passes through the magnetic ring and sticks in the cylinder rod consequently when the cylinder rod moves the measurement signal generates with the variation of the superposed magnetic field between the magnetic ring and the measurement rod the current output is at the range of 4 20 ma and it could be converted as voltage output at the range of 1 5 v by use of a fixed resistance of 250 ω consequently the feedback coefficient of the displacement transducer is calibrated as follow 28 k f u s y s 25 v m therefore the block diagram for the proportional valve controlled water cylinder system can be drawn as shown in fig 10 considering the asymmetric characteristic of water actuator cylinder the performance of extension motion is different from that of retraction movement the mathematic model of the valve controlled cylinder system at the process of extension and retraction is respectively established in order to analyze the performance of the system more precisely the mathematic models are invoked dynamically in simulation according to the position deviation the simulink model is shown in fig 11 and the parameter values of the model are listed in table 2 due to the asymmetric characteristic of the water cylinder the extension motion is different from the retraction motion that makes the control more difficult the conventional pid controller is not suitable for the variable system because the control parameters cannot be adjusted online as a result combining the conventional pid algorithm and fuzzy logic using fuzzy inference to tune the pid controller parameters online according to the deviation and gradient of output and input is an effective method to improving the control performance cai et al 2013 the schematic diagram of fuzzy pid controller is as shown in fig 12 the fuzzy inference system is a two input three output system that is created through the simulink fuzzy logic toolbox the deviation and gradient of the difference between actual and objective displacement are chosen as the input variables for the fuzzy inference the discourse universe of the input variables are both adjusted into the intervals 6 6 through scaling factors and the triangle membership function is adopted the discourse universe of the output variables are also rated in the intervals 6 6 and the triangle membership function is adopted as well the fuzzy inference output variables are then adjusted by scaling factors and finally as the variations of pid parameters δkp δki and δkd so as to dynamically tune the pid parameters online according to the characteristic of pid controller the fuzzy logic rules are chosen and listed in tables 3 5 consequently the fuzzy pid control logarithm is then expressed as cai et al 2013 29 y t k p0 δ k p e t k i0 δ k i 0 t e t d t k d0 δ k d d e t d t according to the mathematic model of the valve controlled cylinder system the parameters of conventional pid controller are determined as k p 5 5 k i 0 1 and k d 0 29 simultaneous the initial pid parameters for the fuzzy pid controller are accordingly determined as k p0 5 k i0 0 07 and k d0 0 29 the scaling factors of the input variables are 0 6 and 0 1 respectively and the scaling factors of the output variables are 0 7 0 01 and 0 005 respectively 5 discussion according to the simulink model for the proportional directional valve system the bode diagram is obtained as shown in fig 13 the gain margin is 14 1 db and the phase margin is 72 3 deg the break frequency ω c is 3 84 rad s and the phase crossover frequency ω x is 16 rad s this bode diagram demonstrates that the control system has a good stability performance at the same time the responses of the system with conventional pid controller and fuzzy pid controller as well as without anything controller to step reference input are respectively shown in fig 14 the comparisons among the responses indicate that the conventional pid controller and fuzzy pid controller could effectively improve the performance of valve controlled cylinder system the system rise time is about 1 s with pid and fuzzy pid controller and it is about 3 s without controller it clear shows that the system response is much faster with an appropriate controller in addition when a random force disturbance generates the system response with controller can still maintain stable on the contrary the system without controller would have steady state error and the original state would be broken in other word the system with controller is more stable moreover the system with fuzzy pid controller could effectively suppress the overshoot and shows better stability in order to analyze the performance of the valve controlled cylinder system the objective pitch angle α and yaw angle β of underwater vehicle are given as sinusoidal signal the frequency is 0 5 hz and the amplitude is 30 and there has a phase difference of 180 between each other as shown in fig 15 then the objective displacement of each cylinder is obtained based on eq 14 and depicted in fig 16 18 fig 16 shows the objective displacement and the actual displacement of cylinder a1n1 the cylinder a1n1 would make oscillatory movement with the maximum extension displacement 45 mm and the maximum retraction displacement 75 mm in addition it clearly indicates that the valve controlled cylinder system without controller has a bad performance and the system cannot precisely track the objective input the system with a fuzzy pid controller has the best performance and the displacement output of this cylinder can well track the objective input similarly fig 17 shows the objective displacement and the actual displacement of cylinder a2n2 the cylinder a2n2 also makes reciprocating motion and the maximum extension displacement is 30 mm the maximum retraction displacement is 30 mm the valve controlled cylinder system without controller has a bad performance and the system cannot precisely track the objective input the system with a fuzzy pid controller has better performance than that with conventional pid controller or null controller as for cylinder a3n3 the motion is different from cylinder a2n2 and cylinder a3n3 there have two peaks with the input angle changing and the motion stroke is shorter as shown in fig 18 this phenomenon is attributed to the specific locations and orientations of the coordinate systems the maximum extension displacement is 15 mm the maximum retraction displacement is 15 mm the system with a fuzzy pid controller has better performance than that with a conventional pid controller and it has better stability performance in suppressing random disturbances in general the control parameters of pid controller are fixed and the control parameters of fuzzy pid controller can change real time according to the working conditions consequently the fuzzy pid controller has better adaptability and stability the fuzzy pid controller is better suitable to the asymmetry system and complex ocean environment after giving the pitch angle and yaw angle and obtaining the cylinder displacement the actual motion of cylinder is controlled through the proportional directional valve with a fuzzy pid controller system consequently the trajectory of underwater vehicles is controlled specified the objective yaw angle as 30 π 6 rad and given three different reaction thrusts 9000 500 and 50n the trajectories of the underwater vehicle can be derived according to eq 10 hu et al 2015 as shown in figs 19 21 when the thrust is set as 9000 n and the velocity reaches to 42 kn the underwater vehicle would complete the first circle movement in 20 s and the turning diameter is 78 m because the tvcs will take some time to reach the objective yaw angle from the initial state there would have an adjusting track the time spending in the second circle is 11s which is smaller than that of the first circle the ratio of adjusting time to circle time is 0 81 when the thrust is set as 500 n and the velocity reaches to 10 kn the underwater vehicle would complete the first circle movement in 67 s and the turning diameter is 78 m the time spending in second circle is 47 s and the ratio of adjusting time to circle time is 0 42 when the thrust is set as 50 n and the velocity reaches to 3 2 kn the underwater vehicle would complete the first circle movement in 202 s and the turning diameter is still 78 m the time spending in second circle is 148 s and the ratio of adjusting time to circle time is 0 36 in theory it can make an in situ turn if the nozzle direction turns 90 deg compared the sailing track parameters of underwater vehicle driven by different thrust as shown in table 6 the result shows that the turning diameter is always 78 m that is independent with the thrust and sailing speed however the adjustment distance and the period of circle motion are influenced by the thrust and speed the faster the speed is the shorter time the underwater vehicles will spend to complete the turning circle motion but the ratio of adjusting time is higher and the adjusting distance is longer consequently the underwater vehicle utilizing the high pressure water jet propulsion with tvcs has a good maneuverability at both high speed and low speed conditions 6 conclusion the combination of vector thrust control method and high pressure waterjet propulsion technology is very helpful for the improvement of the maneuverability of underwater vehicles especially at low speed conditions in this paper a high pressure waterjet propulsion system equipped with a vectored thrust system was proposed and applied to underwater vehicles instead of rudders and sterns the sailing trajectory was controlled by adjusting the angle of nozzle deflection and the waterjet direction through the tvcs which was a 3rps mechanism implemented through three water hydraulic cylinders controlled by three proportional directional valves the thrust direction was associated with the relative position among the three water hydraulic cylinders and the relationship between the thrust direction and the displacements of the three water cylinders was established through the procedure of solving an inverse kinematics problem the position feedback was provided by measuring the displacements of the cylinders in fact the 3rps mechanism was a valve controlled cylinder system which has asymmetry characteristics consequently the fuzzy pid control strategy was chosen and its performance was studied the results indicated that the system with fuzzy pid controller could effectively track the objective displacement of cylinders and supply a suitable nozzle deflection angle in terms of maneuverability the sailing trajectory was obtained through specifying the parameters the results showed that the turning diameter was 78 m that was independent with the thrust and sailing speed however the adjustment distance and the period of circle motion were associated with the thrust and speed the faster the speed was the shorter time the underwater vehicles spend to completing the turning circle motion but the ratio of adjusting time was higher and the adjusting distance was longer in conclusion the underwater vehicle utilizing the high pressure water jet propulsion with tvcs had a good maneuverability at both high speed and low speed conditions acknowledgments this work was support by the fundamental research funds for central universities hust jctd2016202 and we gratefully acknowledge guo xing for his help

underwater vehicles new adaptive hybrid propulsion combining with waterjet propulsion vector propulsion and glide propulsion together was proposed which effectively improved the flexibility and precise location capability of underwater vehicles zheng et al 2010 four servomotors were adopted to control the directions of four water jet propellers which actuated the underwater vehicles to realize the forward backward rotating floating and sinking motions guo et al 2010 2012 lin and guo 2012 and li et al 2015 compared with screw propellers undulatory and oscillatory propulsion with

hydraulic servo actuators to establish a tvcs each servo actuator was controlled by a two stage electrohydraulic servo valve the position feedback was provided by measuring the actual thrust vector direction by the angular transducers mounted in the axes of the gimbal s universal joint instead of measuring the displacements of the servo actuators the thrust vector direction was the result of the motions of both servo actuators and a linear model of the servo system was developed and simulated since the vectored thruster system was highly nonlinear a fuzzy sliding mode controller had been developed for control purposes le page and holappa 2010a b a novel adaptive control law for the end effector tracking problem of underwater vehicle manipulator systems uvmss was presented antonelli et

2015 zhao et al 2016 combining the high pressure waterjet propulsion system with tvcs and applying it on underwater vehicles has been rarely mentioned in literature in this paper the maneuvering performance of underwater vehicles equipped with high pressure waterjet propulsion system and tvcs was researched the tvcs was a 3rps parallel manipulator which mainly consisted of three water hydraulic cylinders and each cylinder was controlled through a proportional directional valve the deflection angle of the nozzle and waterjet was the resultant motions of the three water cylinders instead of rudders and sterns the sailing trajectory of this underwater vehicle can be controlled by adjusting the waterjet direction and thrust vector even at low speed conditions the maneuverability of this underwater vehicle especially in low speed conditions was obviously improved in comparison with conventional propellers the thrust performance of high pressure waterjet propulsion was studied and the force analysis and dynamics of the underwater vehicle were theoretically researched moreover a 3rps parallel manipulator was built and the position feedback was achieved by measuring the displacements of the cylinders in addition the relationship between the thrust direction and the displacements of the three water cylinders was established through the procedure of solving an inverse

the valve controlled cylinder system the fuzzy pid controller strategy was adopted and its performance was researched in comparison with the conventional pid controller and null controller especially the parameters were specified and the sailing trajectory was obtained and analyzed the maneuverability of underwater vehicles equipped with high pressure water jet propulsion and tvcs was evaluated 2 underwater vehicle the high pressure waterjet propulsion system mainly consists of an inlet port a water positive displacement piston pump and a nozzle as shown in fig 1 the water positive displacement piston pump firstly sucks in low pressure water through the inlet hose and then pressurizes the water to become high pressure stream when the stream with high pressure energy is delivered to the nozzle through the high pressure hose a high speed water jet forms and sprays out of the nozzle with the sprays of the high speed water jet the reaction thrust generates and the vehicles are driven forward since the pressure energy of the working medium is delivered through the flexible high pressure hose the connection between the nozzle and the water hydraulic piston pump is very flexible this flexible characteristic is beneficial to applying the tvcs to adjusting the water jet angle conveniently the direction of underwater vehicles can be controlled by the tvcs instead of rudders and sterns so the maneuverability of underwater vehicles is effectively improved by use of high pressure waterjet propulsion system equipped with a tvcs xin et al 2013 liu et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 the thrust f n is the reaction force created by the high speed water jet leaving from the nozzle according to the momentum conservation equation the thrust can be expressed as 1 f n m out v

5 f n 1 2 c d 2 δ p a out in order to analyze the force characteristic of underwater vehicle equipped with tvcs a three dimensional cartesian coordinate system b xbybzb is built as shown in fig 2 its origin coincides with the buoyant center b the xb axis coincides with the geometry center axis of the underwater vehicles the yb axis is vertical upwards and the zb axis is perpendicular to the paper n is the center point of the nozzle outlet which is considered as the force generation point in addition the direction of the reaction force is controlled by the tvcs the deflection angle can be adjusted at the range of 30 30 on the plane of b xbyb and b xbzb α is the angle between the thrust vector f n and the plane of b xbzb β is the angle between xb axis and the projection of f n on the plane of b xbzb α and β are the two tilt angles that take responsibilities for adjusting the pitch and yaw motions respectively generally the reaction force f n can be decomposed into three components along the coordinate axis 6 f x f n cos α cos β f y f n sin α f z f n cos α sin β at the same time the force moments with respect to the coordinate axis of b xbybzb can be expressed 7 m x 0 m y f z nb m z f y nb where nb is the vector from the nozzle center n to the buoyant center b in addition the hydrodynamic model of the underwater vehicles can be further derived according to the momentum

sideslip angle and angular speed c my β b and c my ω y represent the rotation derivative of yaw moment with respect to the sideslip angle and angular speed moreover the values of parameters are listed in table 1 3 the thrust vector control system the navigation trajectory of underwater vehicle is governed by the tvcs in terms of the structure the tvcs is essentially a 3rps parallel manipulator as shown in fig 3 this parallel mechanism mainly consists of a mobile plate a fixed base plate and three water hydraulic cylinder systems the motion transmission of this parallel mechanism is realized through the three sets of revolute joints spherical joints and prismatic joints the working process of this tvcs is shown in fig 4 the objective deflection angle of the nozzle is as the inputs and then the necessary displacement of each cylinder is derived through inverse kinematic the position of water cylinders are controlled by the water proportional directional valves according to the results of inverse kinematic consequently the specified deflection angle is obtained the extension and retraction motions of the three water cylinders make the mobile plate have different deflection angles so the direction of reaction force and the azimuth of underwater vehicle are regulated accordingly in order to accomplish the inverse kinematic analysis and establish the relationship between the nozzle deflection angle and the positions of the three water cylinders a fixed and a moved three dimension cartesian coordinate system are established namely oa xayaza and on xnynzn as shown in fig 5 the origin of the fixed coordinate system oa xayaza coincides with the fixed base plate geometric center and the x axis coincides with the center axis of the underwater vehicle the moved coordinate system locates on the mobile plate assuming the radius of the top mobile plate is r and the spherical joints on the mobile plate are noted by n 1 n 2 and n 3 therefore the coordinate of the spherical joints in the moving coordinate system can be expressed 11 p n csn n 1 n 2 n 3 0 0 0 r r 2 r 2 0 3 r 2 3 r 2 similarly assuming the radius of the fixed base plates is r and the revolute joints on the base plate are noted by a 1 a 2 and a 3 their locations in the fixed coordinate system can be given by matrix 12 p a csa a 1 a 2 a 3 0 0 0 r r 2 r 2 0 3 r 2 3 r 2 as mentioned above α and β are the two tilt angles which determine the pitch and yaw of the underwater vehicle respectively the transformation matrix from the moving coordinate to the fix coordinate could be given by 13 c a n cos β cos α cos β sin α sin β sin α cos α 0 sin β cos α sin β sin α cos β the transformation matrix c a n is the result of two subsequent principal rotations the first is about zn axis by α and the second is about yn axis by β therefore the coordinates of spherical joints n 1 n 2 and n 3 could be described in the fix coordinate system and the coordinate of o n in the fix coordinate system is 0 0 h then the displacement variation of each water cylinder can be derived as 14 δ l c a n p n csn p a csa l o where l o is the original length vector of the cylinder δ l is the displacement variation of the cylinders in addition the force exerted on the each actuator cylinder can be derived according to space force system 15 t f l 1 f l 2 f l 3 0 where t is vector thrust force generated by the high pressure water jet propulsion f l1 f l2 and f l3 are the vector force exerted on the actuator cylinders assigning values to r r and h with 200 mm 100 mm and 400 mm the displacement of each cylinder with respect to the tilt angle α and β are derived and depicted in fig 6 it is clear that the plotting is symmetrical about the plane of β 0 rad and the displacement of cylinder 1 mainly relates to the tilt angle α the position of cylinder 2 and 3 mainly relates to the tilt angle β due to the specific location and orientation of the coordinate systems supposing the thrust force is 9000 n the load distribution of each actuator cylinder with respect to the nozzle deflection angle is shown in fig 7 the negative force is point to stress and the positive force represents tension it clearly shows that the cylinders do not always sustain stress and the cylinders would sustain tension under some conditions to make the tvcs reach to force balance like the displacement plotting of cylinders the force plotting is also symmetrical about the plane of β 0 rad and the force of cylinder 1 mainly relates to the tilt angle α the force of cylinder 2 and 3 mainly relates to the tilt angle β 4 water valve control water cylinder model in terms of control system the tvcs is a water proportional directional valve controlled asymmetric water cylinder system the schematic diagram is shown in fig 8 and the asymmetric characteristic of the cylinder makes its extension motion performance different from that of its retraction movement in order to implement such control and evaluate its performance a reliable yet simple dynamic model for cylinder motion is necessary then the load pressure p l and load flow q l is simplified and redefined as follow dan et al 2010 dong et al 2010 song et al 2015 16 p l f a 1 p 1 n p 2 q l q 1 n q 2 1 n 2 where p 1 and p 2 are the working pressure of piston chamber and rod chamber respectively q 1 and q 2 represent the flow rate within the

obtained 21 q l q 1 n q 2 1 n 2 a 1 d y d t v t 2 1 n 2 β c d p l d t c tc p l c tc0 p s where c tc0 n 2 n 2 1 n 2 1 n 3 1 c ic and c tc n 1 n 3 1 c ic c ec n 2 1 at the same time the force

the proportional valve is 2m23bnsw produced by waterhydraulic co ltd the type of amplifier is wandfluh p02 whose maximum output current is 1 15 a and the corresponding maximum spool displacement is 4

displacement gain coefficient k sv 3 28 10 4 m a the valve nature frequency ω v 16 rad s the valve damping ratio δ v 0 6 the proportional amplifier is a voltage current converter with higher output impedance and wider frequency bandwidth it can be simplified as a proportional element 27 i s u s k a 0 2 a v the water hydraulic cylinder is designed and manufactured by ourselves as shown in fig 9 a built in magnetostrictive displacement transducer tdm lpa1 150m1c3 wo with the measuring range of 0 150 mm is integrated in the cylinder rod to detect the displacement the displacement transducer mainly consists of a magnetic ring and a measure rod the magnetic ring is mounted on the cylinder rod the measure rod is fixed on the cylinder and it passes through the magnetic ring and sticks in the cylinder rod consequently when the cylinder rod moves the measurement signal generates with the variation of the superposed magnetic field between the magnetic ring and the measurement rod the current output is at the range of 4 20 ma and it could be converted as voltage output at the range of 1 5 v by use of a fixed resistance of 250 ω consequently the feedback coefficient of the displacement transducer is calibrated as follow 28 k f u s y s 25 v m therefore the block diagram for the proportional valve controlled water cylinder system can be drawn as shown in fig 10 considering the asymmetric characteristic of water actuator cylinder the performance of extension motion is different from that of retraction movement the mathematic model of the valve controlled cylinder system at the process of extension and retraction is respectively established in order to analyze the performance of the system more precisely the mathematic models are invoked dynamically in simulation according to the position deviation the simulink model is shown in fig 11 and the parameter values of the model are listed in table 2 due to the asymmetric characteristic of the water cylinder the extension motion is different from the retraction motion that makes the control more difficult the conventional pid controller is not suitable for the variable system because the control parameters cannot be adjusted online as a result combining the conventional pid algorithm and fuzzy logic using fuzzy inference to tune the pid controller parameters online according to the deviation and gradient of output and input is an effective method to improving the control performance cai et al 2013 the schematic diagram of fuzzy pid controller is as shown in fig 12 the fuzzy inference system is a two input three output system that is created through the simulink fuzzy logic toolbox the deviation and gradient of the difference between actual and objective displacement are chosen as the input variables for the fuzzy inference the discourse universe of the input variables are both adjusted into the intervals 6 6 through scaling factors and the triangle membership function is adopted the discourse universe of the output variables are also rated in the intervals 6 6 and the triangle membership function is adopted as well the fuzzy inference output variables are then adjusted by scaling factors and finally as the variations of pid parameters δkp δki and δkd so as to dynamically tune the pid parameters online according to the characteristic of pid controller the fuzzy logic rules are chosen and listed in tables 3 5 consequently the fuzzy pid control logarithm is then expressed as cai et al 2013 29 y t k p0 δ k p e t k i0 δ k i 0 t e t d t k d0 δ k d d e t d t according to the mathematic model of the valve controlled cylinder system the parameters of conventional pid controller are determined as k p 5 5 k i 0 1 and k d 0 29 simultaneous the initial pid parameters for the fuzzy pid controller are accordingly determined as k p0 5 k i0 0 07 and k d0 0 29 the scaling factors of the input variables are 0 6 and 0 1 respectively and the scaling factors of the output variables are 0 7 0 01 and 0 005 respectively 5 discussion according to the simulink model for the proportional directional valve system the bode diagram is obtained as shown in fig 13 the gain margin is 14 1 db and the phase margin is 72 3 deg the break frequency ω c is 3 84 rad s and the phase crossover frequency ω x is 16 rad s this bode diagram demonstrates that the control system has a good stability performance at the same time the responses of the system with conventional pid controller and fuzzy pid controller as well as without anything controller to step reference input are respectively shown in fig 14 the comparisons among the responses indicate that the conventional pid controller and fuzzy pid controller could effectively improve the performance of valve controlled cylinder system the system rise time is about 1 s with pid and fuzzy pid controller and it is about 3 s without controller it clear shows that the system response is much faster with an appropriate controller in addition when a random force disturbance generates the system response with controller can still maintain stable on the contrary the system without controller would have steady state error and the original state would be broken in other word the system with controller is more stable moreover the system with fuzzy pid controller could effectively suppress the overshoot and shows better stability in order to analyze the performance of the valve controlled cylinder system the objective pitch angle α and yaw angle β of underwater vehicle are given as sinusoidal signal the frequency is 0 5 hz and the amplitude is 30 and there has a phase difference of 180 between each other as shown in fig 15 then the objective displacement of each cylinder is obtained based on eq 14 and depicted in fig 16 18 fig 16 shows the objective displacement and the actual displacement of cylinder a1n1 the cylinder a1n1 would make oscillatory movement with the maximum extension displacement 45 mm and the maximum retraction displacement 75 mm in addition it clearly indicates that the valve controlled cylinder system without controller has a bad performance and the system cannot precisely track the objective input the system with a fuzzy pid controller has the best performance and the displacement output of this cylinder can well track the objective input similarly fig 17 shows the objective displacement and the actual displacement of cylinder a2n2 the cylinder a2n2 also makes reciprocating motion and the maximum extension displacement is 30 mm the maximum retraction displacement is 30 mm the valve controlled cylinder system without controller has a bad performance and the system cannot precisely track the objective input the system with a fuzzy pid controller has better performance than that with conventional pid controller or null controller as for cylinder a3n3 the motion is different from cylinder a2n2 and cylinder a3n3 there have two peaks with the input angle changing and the motion stroke is shorter as shown in fig 18 this phenomenon is attributed to the specific locations and orientations of the coordinate systems the maximum extension displacement is 15 mm the maximum retraction displacement is 15 mm the system with a fuzzy pid controller has better performance than that with a conventional pid controller and it has better stability performance in suppressing random disturbances in general the control parameters of pid controller are fixed and the control parameters of fuzzy pid controller can change real time according to the working conditions consequently the fuzzy pid controller has better adaptability and stability the fuzzy pid controller is better suitable to the asymmetry system and complex ocean environment after giving the pitch angle and yaw angle and obtaining the cylinder displacement the actual motion of cylinder is controlled through the proportional directional valve with a fuzzy pid controller system consequently the trajectory of underwater vehicles is controlled specified the objective yaw angle as 30 π 6 rad and given three different reaction thrusts 9000 500 and 50n the trajectories of the underwater vehicle can be derived according to eq 10 hu et al 2015 as shown in figs 19 21 when the thrust is set as 9000 n and the velocity reaches to 42 kn the underwater vehicle would complete the first circle movement in 20 s and the turning diameter is 78 m because the tvcs will take some time to reach the objective yaw angle from the initial state there would have an adjusting track the time spending in the second circle is 11s which is smaller than that of the first circle the ratio of adjusting time to circle time is 0 81 when the thrust is set as 500 n and the velocity reaches to 10 kn the underwater vehicle would complete the first circle movement in 67 s and the turning diameter is 78 m the time spending in second circle is 47 s and the ratio of adjusting time to circle time is 0 42 when the thrust is set as 50 n and the velocity reaches to 3 2 kn the underwater vehicle would complete the first circle movement in 202 s and the turning diameter is still 78 m the time spending in second circle is 148 s and the ratio of adjusting time to circle time is 0 36 in theory it can make an in situ turn if the nozzle direction turns 90 deg compared the sailing track parameters of underwater vehicle driven by different thrust as shown in table 6 the result shows that the turning diameter is always 78 m that is independent with the thrust and sailing speed however the adjustment distance and the period of circle motion are influenced by the thrust and speed the faster the speed is the shorter time the underwater vehicles will spend to complete the turning circle motion but the ratio of adjusting time is higher and the adjusting distance is longer consequently the underwater vehicle utilizing the high pressure water jet propulsion with tvcs has a good maneuverability at both high speed and low speed conditions 6 conclusion the combination of vector thrust control method and high pressure waterjet propulsion technology is very helpful for the improvement of the maneuverability of underwater vehicles especially at low speed conditions in this paper a high pressure waterjet propulsion system equipped with a vectored thrust system was proposed and applied to underwater vehicles instead of rudders and sterns the sailing trajectory was controlled by adjusting the angle of nozzle deflection and the waterjet direction through the tvcs which was a 3rps mechanism implemented through three water hydraulic cylinders controlled by three proportional directional valves the thrust direction was associated with the relative position among the three water hydraulic cylinders and the relationship between the thrust direction and the displacements of the three water cylinders was established through the procedure of solving an inverse kinematics problem the position feedback was provided by measuring the displacements of the cylinders in fact the 3rps mechanism was a valve controlled cylinder system which has asymmetry characteristics consequently the fuzzy pid control strategy was chosen and its performance was studied the results indicated that the system with fuzzy pid controller could effectively track the objective displacement of cylinders and supply a suitable nozzle deflection angle in terms of maneuverability the sailing trajectory was obtained through specifying the parameters the results showed that the turning diameter was 78 m that was independent with the thrust and sailing speed however the adjustment distance and the period of circle motion were associated with the thrust and speed the faster the speed was the shorter time the underwater vehicles spend to completing the turning circle motion but the ratio of adjusting time was higher and the adjusting distance was longer in conclusion the underwater vehicle utilizing the high pressure water jet propulsion with tvcs had a good maneuverability at both high speed and low speed conditions acknowledgments this work was support by the fundamental research

drilling rigs deployed in offshore engineering often penetrate over 10 m in soft soils to provide enough bearing capacity for the upper structures inevitably inducing large soil movements and in turn non negligible soil loads on the adjacent piles mirza et al 1988 thus it is necessary for the pile design to evaluate the effects of the additional loading caused by spudcan penetration especially for a spudcan pile clearance less than one spudcan diameter in the soil soils sname 2002 which is often met for deep water operations a direct analysis of the spudcan pile interaction can be conducted in cel analysis which includes both the spudcan and the adjacent pile in a 3d model and the obtained pile shaft bending moments and soil flow contours prove to be convincing when compared with available centrifuge model tests arslan and wong 2014 tho et al 2013 wang and lan 2016 xie 2009 however the critical condition should be a combination of the spudcan penetration induced loads and the environmental effects which needs a series of analyzing parameters the all in model may also be time consuming and not efficient when different working conditions are considered on the other hand the decoupled analyzing method divides the spudcan penetration effects into two steps the large soil displacements induced by spudcan penetration and in turn the pile response due to the soil loads an accurate simulation of the soil displacement is thus a necessity in a decoupled spudcan pile interaction analysis but it is rarely seen in the literature to get a convincing soil displacement profile

place assumption lyons and wilson 1985 an acceptable result of the penetration resistance may be obtained but it cannot meet the demand for soil displacement calculation therefore large deformation finite element ldfe methods should be considered to get an accurate soil displacement profile ldfe methods have been successfully applied to the simulation of the spudcan penetration process and may be helpful in soil displacement calculation researchers have done extensive works based on the commercial fe software package abaqus by the cel qiu and grabe 2012 tho et al 2013 mesh to mesh ragni et al 2016 tian et al 2014 and ale adaptive meshing li et al 2015 techniques among the available numerical simulation of free field spudcan penetration attention has been mainly paid to the prediction of penetration resistance and the risk of punch through only li et al 2015 adopted the ale technique in abaqus to simulate the soil displacements in one of xie s centrifuge model tests and the predicted results at the final penetration depth agree well with the test results however the ale technique in abaqus does not change the topology of the mesh during the calculation which makes it difficult to account for large deformation of the soils in addition only one large deformation material can be considered in the ale analysis in abaqus adding further restraints to its application the cel technique may be an effective way to give more accurate and flexible simulation of soil deformation during spudcan penetration it is characterized by the ability to simulate the deformation of layered soils which gives more flexibility to the simulation tho et al 2015 adopted the cel method in the first step to calculate the soil displacement profiles when analyzing a centrifuge model test of perfectly fixed head pile only subjected to spudcan penetration xie 2009 however the calculated soil displacement profiles seem to be diverging when compared with measured results and in turn lead to overestimated bending moments the gap may be a result of unrealistic model settings in this paper the cel method is improved for accurate soil displacement calculation with firstly an additional python code to aid the analysis and then material parameters adjusted to be consistent with the next step as for the second step there are two ways may be used to transform the soil displacements into the soil loads acting on the pile shaft the offset p y method and the passive pile analyzing method the former considers the soil loading effects by shifting the conventional soil springs according to the soil displacements and then adds the loads from the environment and the upper structure to the pile head mirza et al 1988 the latter however predicts the pile response using the passive pile analyzing method by which the response of piles or retaining walls influenced by lateral soil movements have been extensively explored in the simulation of excavation embankment or pile driving with adjacent structures goh et al 1997 leung et al 2013 poulos 1994 when the pile is subjected to a combination of spudcan penetration and pile head loads it is a necessity to make clear how to determine the corresponding pile responses according to the above analyses this paper is organized as follows first a procedure to analyze the lateral responses of piles subjected to a combination of spudcan penetration and pile head loads is presented the post processing of the cel technique is discussed for the first stage of the procedure then compared with a centrifuge model test key parameters in the numerical simulation are investigated to give accurate results of the induced soil displacements during spudcan penetration finally a 1 g model test is conducted and analyzed by the procedure in the second stage the simulated results are considered in two ways and the corresponding bending moment profiles are compared with the model test respectively to prove the feasibility of the aforementioned process to consider the effects of spudcan penetration on the adjacent laterally loaded piles 2 analysis procedure the procedure is based on the conventional two stage method proposed by poulos and chen 1997 to analyze passive piles in which the soil displacement profile is firstly estimated or calculated and then input into the equation of an elastic foundation beam in the second step to facilitate the analysis of the combined loaded piles considering both spudcan penetration and pile head loads the two stage procedure needs to be improved as followings a ldfe method is first be utilized to yield accurate soil displacement profiles and then a proper method to analyze the piles combining both active and passive behaviors is discussed to generate the corresponding responses of piles subjected to a combination of spudcan penetration and pile head loads 2 1 soil displacement calculation considering large soil deformation occurring during spudcan penetration the ldfe methods may be adopted to simulate the process with adequate accuracy here the cel method is selected because it has been extensively adopted in spudcan penetration simulation hossain et al 2011 qiu and grabe 2012 the cel technique in abaqus lies within the ale ldfe methods based on the operator split in computational mechanics with firstly an explicit lagrangian phase and then an eulerian convection phase wang et al 2015 during calculation the mesh is fixed with material flowing in it by which mesh distortion can be avoided however after a cel calculation of spudcan penetration a post processing python code needs to be written to get the absolute soil displacement profiles for that the material and the mesh separate with each other at every incremental calculation to track a certain material particle its displacement during every incremental calculation needs to be extracted from the output database and given that in the abaqus cel calculation only the velocity is output the displacement will be obtained by node velocity integration pucker and grabe 2012 in the paper an appropriate output interval is set to 100 output data sets per step with some incremental calculations neglected but leading to efficiency and adequate accuracy for that the material particle may not locate itself exactly on the mesh node the particle should first be spotted to find the element containing it throughout the whole analyzing domain and then the velocity of the particle can be interpolated based on the spatial coordinates in this paper considering that spudcan penetration is an axisymmetrical problem where every material particle just moves within a certain plane of symmetry and for that the projected element face are all rectangles the element containing the particle can be determined by eq 1 1 a min x x c 2 y y c 2 1 2 where x y is the current coordinate of the target point and x c y c is the center of gravity of the element after finding the element the velocity of the particle can be obtained by the bilinear interpolation function eq 2 2 v a v j v i v i b a v k v m v j v i v m v i where i j k m are the counter clock numbering of a face of the eulerian octahedral element v i v j v k v m are the corresponding node velocities of the i j k m node v is the velocity of the target point a x x i x j x i and b y y j y k y j the interpolated velocity can be seen as the average velocity during the interval and the displacement of the target point can be obtained by integration of time the corresponding flow chart of the python code is given in fig 1 combined with the flow chart soil displacement profiles can be calculated as follows 1 establish the cel free field spudcan penetration model and set the load and boundary conditions 2 set the model penetration rate and the output frequency and submit the job in abaqus 4 after abaqus calculation run the script in fig 1 to calculate soil displacement profiles based on the output database file the cel technique can include different materials in its large deformation area and can provide better simulation compared with the mesh to mesh and the adaptive ale technique in abaqus for its free simulation of deformation the effectiveness of the cel technique to obtain accurate soil displacement will be examined later by simulation of two model tests 2 2 pile response after soil lateral displacement calculation an appropriate method should be used to predict the response of piles subjected to spudcan penetration induced soil displacements and the pile head load for step 2 of the procedure at present two possible ways may be adopted for the purpose the offset p y curve method an active pile analyzing method raised by mirza et al 1988 and the conventional passive pile analyzing method poulos 1994 the above two methods can both be combined with the fdm finite difference method in pile response calculation and a brief introduction of the procedure involved is outlined as follows the lateral soil pressure can be obtained by eq 3 the beam horizontal flexural equation is expressed as eq 4 based on the foundation beam theory 3 p z k s y z k s y s z y p z 4 e p i p d 4 y p z d z 4 p z where y s z is the calculated soil displacement y p z is the pile shaft lateral deflection y z is the pile soil relative displacement p z is the lateral soil pressure and k s is the subgrade reaction modulus at a certain depth kn m3 combining the above two equations eq 5 can be obtained to determine the pile lateral deflection 5 d 4 y p z d z 4 4 λ 4 y p z y s z 0 where λ k s 4 e p i p 4 is the flexibility index because of the changing soil properties along depth the differential form eq 5 cannot be directly used to calculate pile responses instead it should be transformed into a difference form where pile needs to be discretized into n segments with an uniform length of δ and 2 extra virtual nodes are added to the head and tip of the pile respectively the node numbering is described in fig 2 then goes the n 1 order equation set 6 with n 5 variables combining the another 4 boundary conditions the pile responses are yielded and the boundary conditions can be given based on known bending moment shear force deflection and rotation angle eqs 7 9 at the tip or head of the pile 6 y p i 2 4 y p i 1 6 4 λ i δ 4 y p i 4 y p i 1 y p i 2 4 λ i δ 4 y s i where 3 i n 3 7 m i e p i y p i 1 2 y p i y p i 1 p δ 2 8 v i e p i y p i 2 2 y p i 1 2 y p i 1 y p i 2 p 2 δ 3 9 θ i y p i 1 y p i 1 2 δ where m i is the bending moment v i is the shear force and θ is the rotation angle however in order to consider the non linear stress strain responses of the soils an iterative procedure was found to give better performance when compared to the incremental integration and should be conducted to consider the softening of soil during the calculation in the calculation the new subgrade reaction modulus k s is obtained after a series of fdm calculation based on the new pile deflection y p and initial soil displacement y s if the difference between y p and y s exceeds the allowing error 0 5 k s instead of the original subgrade reaction modulus k s is substituted into eq 6 to carry out another series of calculation fig 3 in this way the pile shaft deflections can be solved with considering the non linear soil stress strain response in the following sections the active and passive methods based on api p y curves are adopted to analyze the responses of piles in two loading conditions a pile singly loaded by spudcan penetration and a pile subjected to a combination of the spudcan penetration and a lateral load on the pile head by comparison with the model test results the applicability of the two analyzing methods can be examined 3 numerical simulation of a centrifuge model test 3 1 brief description of the model test xie 2009 conducted a 100 g spudcan pile interaction centrifuge model test in clay where the pile is perfectly fixed head and only subjected to spudcan penetration during the test the spudcan advanced downwards to a final penetration depth of 15 m at an average displacement speed of over 1 2 mm s with the pile bending moment distributions monitored throughout the process malaysia kaolin clay with a specific gravity of 2 60 a liquid limit of 80 and a plastic limit of 35 was adopted in the test the kaolin clay slurry consolidated in 100 g in flight to reach a degree of consolidation of as high as 99 and its effective unit weight was taken as 6 kn m3 four t bar tests were conducted in flight and a best fitting of the variation of undrained shear strength with depth is given in eq 10 10 s u 2 1 5 z where s u is the undrained shear strength z is the depth below the seabed the to your a sand was air pluviated into the container and the dry density was 1 579 g cm3 in the model tests its effective unit weight was taken as 9 kn m3 other details of the test configuration are given in fig 4 the penetration depth in the test means the position of lower elevation of the largest diameter the steel pipe pile used in the test was 27 m long with an outer diameter of 1 26 m and a wall thickness of 0 038 m the soil movement was measured using the piv technique in an equivalent half model test where the soil movement at the pile position can be extracted 3 2 numerical model definition and key parameters the cel technique is then utilized to simulate the 0 25d spudcan diameter clearance condition and the calculated soil displacement profiles at different penetration depths will be obtained using a post processing code fig 5 gives the numerical model a quarter of the cylindrical soil domain is modeled to reduce calculation cost considering the axisymmetry of the test a fine mesh of 0 03d within the center 1 5d of the domain and a coarse mesh of 0 1d are established at the outer part besides other dimension settings of the soils and the spudcan completely established according to the test an additional 10 m high void area is set to allow for soil upheaval 8 noded brick element ec3d8r in abaqus is used to model the soil domain and 4 noded solid element c3d4 to model the spudcan respectively the interaction between the spudcan and clay was assumed to be frictionless in the tangential direction and allowed to separate at zero contact pressure in the normal direction lateral velocities are set as zero on the side boundaries and the vertical degree of freedom is restrained for the bottom boundary during numerical simulation the spudcan will advance at a speed of 0 2 m s which is proved to guarantee a pseudo static penetration process qiu and grabe 2012 to be consistent with step 2 where api p y data are adopted to obtain the pile response a necessary parameter ε 50 is considered in material settings as suggested by matlock 1970 ε 50 the axial strain at half of the yield stress should be considered according to the value of the latter and it is also suggested that ε 50 range from 0 5 to 2 for soft and stiff clay with undrained shear strength ranging from 12 to 96 kpa for very soft soils the value of ε 50 can be 6 two typical stress strain curves representing very soft clays with an ε 50 equal to 6 and stiff clays with an ε 50 of 1 are given by li et al 2015 in fig 6 considering that the undrained shear strength is only 2 kpa at the surface of the analyzing domain and increases linearly with the depth the clay at the seabed is established as the solid line representing the very soft soil and the bottom clay is set according to the dash line for a stiff soil in fig 6 the stress strain curves of the clay are then transformed into tabular material property parameters according to the multi stage isotropic hardening elasto plastic models obeying the mises yield criterion the model parameters include yield stress q the corresponding plastic strain ε elastic modulus e and the poisson ratio μ q ε can be directly derived from evenly distributed points on the curves fig 6 e is determined by the assumption that the materials initially yield at an axial strain of 0 25 ten subsequent yield stresses are input with corresponding strains for a better simulation of the curves before the final yield strength determined according to the curves abaqus will make auto interpolation for the intermediate soils also μ for the clay is taken as 0 49 to consider undrained condition an elastic perfectly plastic constitutive model obeying the mohr coulomb yield criterion is adopted to depict the stress strain relationship of the sand according to xie s research 2009 the elastic modulus e the poisson ratio μ and the internal friction angle θ are taken as 77mpa 0 3 and 32 respectively measured soil lateral movement profiles at different spudcan penetration depths are compared with simulated results in fig 7 the centrifuge model test results are represented by symbols and the results calculated by the cel method are drawn by solid lines the calculated results here agree well with the centrifuge model test however tho et al 2015 adopted the cel technique to analyze the model test and the results are dissimilar to the measured results especially in deep penetration depths fig 8 tho et al 2015 simply adopted a tresca constitutive model to depict clay behaviors with the elastic modulus of clay set as 150 times the undrained shear strength compared with the results predicted by tho et al 2015 the differences can be attributed to different soil model parameters especially the soil modulus 3 3 pile response calculation xie s centrifuge model test simulated a perfectly fixed pile head condition only applied with spudcan induced soil loads the pile shaft bending moments were measured during spudcan penetration according to the test results the bending moment and shear force at the pile tip are zero like a floating pile thus four boundary conditions can be given as follows and combined with the equation set 6 the pile response can be solved combined with equations 11 14 11 y p 3 0 12 y p 4 y p 2 0 13 y p n 4 2 y p n 3 y p n 2 0 14 y p n 5 2 y p n 4 2 y p n 2 y p n 1 0 it should be noted that the offset p y method cannot be applied to the perfect passive pile condition i e a pile singly loaded with the spudcan penetration therefore only the passive pile method is adopted to analyze the centrifuge model test for simplicity the resulting bending moment profiles at 3 different penetration depths 9 m 12 m and 15 m based on the cel method are then given in fig 9 4 validation of the procedure to analysis of the combined loading condition 4 1 model test description in order to further validate the procedure for analyzing the response of piles subjected to a combination of spudcan penetration and pile head loads an 1 g spudcan penetration tests in clay was carried out to investigate the responses of the adjacent piles and the soil displacement simultaneously tian 2016 the model test configuration is given in fig 10 the circular aluminum alloy pile was 12 3 mm in diameter with a wall thickness of 1 15 mm and 1 15 m in length the pile rigidity was 37 42 n m2 during all the tests pile was assumed as wished in place with an embedment depth of 0 9 m fig 10 the model spudcan was 18 cm in diameter and detailed dimensions are shown in fig 11 physical properties of the clay involved in the test were measured before the test its liquid limit was calibrated as 44 44 plastic limit as 27 01 and water content as 40 13 the unit weight was also taken as 7 83 kn m3 the disturbed clay was allowed to regain its strength for 4 days with the soil depth reaches 0 9 m vane shear tests were conducted in 9 target points before the model tests and a fitting linear function of undrained soil strength variation with depth is given by eq 15 15 s u 5 3 10 z then the instrumented pile and the soil displacement transducers were installed axisymmetrically at both sides of the spudcan along the long axis of the tank and after waiting for another 3 days the spudcan was penetrated and extracted at a constant speed of 0 1 mm s with soil displacements and pile responses constantly recorded similar to the currently commercial displacement transducer saa shape acceleration array which has an extensive usage in field displacement monitoring like embankment induced soil movement hendry et al 2013 a series of self developed hinge joint angle transducers fig 10 with a cross end to simulate a fixed condition was improved in aspects of dimension cross section and the joints to meet up with the requirements of precision and data density in the small scale testing condition in view of the research conducted by xie 2009 the effects of spudcan penetration mainly manifest itself in the lateral direction thus only the lateral soil displacement was investigated in the test although the transducers can only sense the displacements in the lateral direction the adoption of the soil displacement transducers is enough to replace the traditional piv technology to avoid additional half spudcan tests based on the assumption that the bottom displacement is zero the lateral soil displacement at a certain clearance from the spudcan can be easily calculated by measurement of the inclination angles of the transducers the soil displacement transducer series have eight 0 1 m long working elements and two 0 1 m long end elements on both sides fig 10 hinge joints allow for free rotation in the directions of both x and y within the horizontal plane but restrain rotation around the z axis with the advance of the spudcan the soil displacement transducers may deform with the soil and the 8 working elements may form vertical angles of θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 θ 4 θ 5 θ 6 θ 7 and θ 8 from bottom to top fig 10 the soil displacement at the location of each transducer can be calculated using eq 16 and in this way the distribution profile at a certain clearance from the spudcan can be obtained 16 u i k 0 i δ l tan θ k where u i is the lateral displacement at the top of the ith working element θ k is the vertical angle of the kth working element the 1 g model test simulated the condition of combined loading in which a lateral load of 25 n is applied to the perfectly free pile head 0 2 m above the soil surface before the spudcan penetration fig 10 4 2 soil displacement an quarter cel 3d model is established according to the test settings fig 12 the model is meshed in the same way of that of xie s model test a triaxial uu test was conducted on a soil sample taken from the soil box given that the soil depth is only 0 9 m the key parameter ε 50 is then considered as 5 uniformly in depth based on the stress strain curve see fig 13 both in the numerical model and in the second step an elastic multi hardening plastic constitutive model obeying the mises yield criterion is also adopted to depict the stress strain relationship of the clay soil displacement profiles at a clearance of 0 25d at 5 typical penetration depths were drawn as symbols in fig 14 and the numerical and measured results are compared which again proves to be similar 4 3 pile response bending moment was also recorded during the whole test according to the test settings the pile tip is assumed to be fixed in displacement and free in rotation and the pile head at the surface is perfectly free but with a shear force equal to 25 n and a bending moment of 25 0 2 n m as expressed in eqs 17 20 17 y p 5 2 y p 4 2 y p 2 y p 1 2 h δ 3 e i 18 y p 4 2 y p 3 y p 2 m δ 2 e i 19 y p n 4 2 y p n 3 y p n 2 0 20 y p n 5 2 y p n 4 2 y p n 2 y p n 1 0 where h equals to 25 n m equals to 5 n m and ei is the pile rigidity for the passive pile method the obtained soil displacement profiles are input directly into the parameter y s z to yield bending moment as for the offset p y method the p y curve at a certain depth will be adjusted by adding the soil displacement at the depth to the y axis to make the curve softer then the offset p y curve is combined with the lateral pile head load to calculate the corresponding bending moment profiles measured and calculated results at 5 penetration depths are given in fig 15 up to a spudcan penetration of 0 2 m the offset p y method tends to give a better simulation of the test while the passive pile method can predict the bending moment better when the spudcan advances deeper than 0 2 m the offset p y method constantly predicts active pile response which in shallow penetration depths is accurate enough because the lateral load on the pile head dominates the pile deformation however in deep penetration depths the pile response tends to become a mixture of active and passive pile behaviors and the passive pile method is accurate enough to predict the pile response 5 conclusions pile responses under combined loading of the spudcan penetration and the lateral pile head load are analyzed in two steps to investigate practical loading conditions of the offshore platform piles with jack up rigs operating in the proximity for the first step large soil displacements occurring during the spudcan penetration are difficult to evaluate by the conventional analytical solutions such as the cavity expansion method which in turn hinders the application of the two stage method to the calculation of pile response thus an appropriate and accurate soil displacement calculation method is first explored by post processing the cel technique and soil material parameters are investigated to form the first step to analyze the influence of spudcan penetration on the adjacent piles then the obtained soil displacements are input to the non linear foundation beam model both as a new set of offset p y data and as displacement itself in passive pile analysis both the soil displacements and the pile responses are compared to available model test results it is indicated that the two soil displacement calculation methods can both yield agreeable results for the first step as for the pile analysis in the second step the passive pile analysis is suitable for the pile analysis in the combined loading condition while the offset p y method can only give reliable solutions for active piles

problem where every material particle just moves within a certain plane of symmetry and for that the projected element face are all rectangles the element containing the particle can be determined by eq 1 1 a min x x c 2 y y c 2 1 2 where x y is the current coordinate of the target point and x c y c is the center of gravity of the element after finding the element the velocity of the particle can be obtained by the bilinear interpolation function eq 2 2 v a v j v i v i b a v k v m v j v i v m v i where i j k m are the counter clock numbering of a face of the eulerian octahedral element v i v j v k v m are the corresponding node velocities of the i j k m node v is the velocity of the target point a x x i x j x i and b y y j y k y j the interpolated velocity can be seen as the average velocity during the interval and the displacement of the target point can be obtained by integration of time the corresponding flow chart of the python code is given in fig 1 combined with the flow chart soil displacement profiles can be calculated as follows 1 establish the cel free field spudcan penetration model and set the load and boundary conditions 2 set the model penetration rate and the output frequency and submit the job in abaqus 4 after abaqus calculation run the script in fig 1 to calculate soil displacement profiles based on the output database file the cel technique can include different materials in its large deformation area and can provide better simulation compared with the mesh to mesh and the adaptive ale technique in abaqus for its free simulation of deformation the effectiveness of the cel technique to obtain accurate soil displacement will be examined later by simulation of two model tests 2 2 pile response after soil lateral displacement calculation an appropriate method should be used to predict the response of piles subjected to spudcan penetration induced soil displacements and the pile head load for step 2 of the procedure at present two possible ways may be adopted for the purpose the offset p y curve method an active pile analyzing method raised by mirza et al 1988 and the conventional passive pile analyzing method poulos 1994 the above two methods can both be combined with the fdm finite difference method in pile response calculation and a brief introduction of the procedure involved is outlined as follows the lateral soil pressure can be obtained by eq 3 the beam horizontal flexural equation is expressed as eq 4 based on the foundation beam theory 3 p z k s y z k s y s z y p z 4 e p i p d 4 y p z d z 4 p z where y s z is the calculated soil displacement y p z is the pile shaft lateral deflection y z is the pile soil relative displacement p z is the lateral soil pressure and k s is the subgrade reaction modulus at a certain depth kn m3 combining the above two equations eq 5 can be obtained to determine the pile lateral deflection 5 d 4 y p z d z 4 4 λ 4 y p z y s z 0 where λ k s 4 e p i p 4 is the flexibility index because of the changing soil properties along depth the differential form eq 5 cannot be directly used to calculate pile responses instead it should be transformed into a difference form where pile needs to be discretized into n segments with an uniform length of δ and 2 extra virtual nodes are added to the head and tip of the pile respectively the node numbering is described in fig 2 then goes the n 1 order equation set 6 with n 5 variables combining the another 4 boundary conditions the pile responses are yielded and the boundary conditions can be given based on known bending moment shear force deflection and rotation angle eqs 7 9 at the tip or head of the pile 6 y p i 2 4 y p i 1 6 4 λ i δ 4 y p i 4 y p i 1 y p i 2 4 λ i δ 4 y s i where 3 i n 3 7 m i e p i y p i 1 2 y p i y p i 1 p δ 2 8 v i e p i y p i 2 2 y p i 1 2 y p i 1 y p i 2 p 2 δ 3 9 θ i y p i 1 y p i 1 2 δ where m i is the bending moment v i is the shear force and θ is the rotation angle however in order to consider the non linear stress strain responses of the soils an iterative procedure was found to give better performance when compared to the incremental integration and should be conducted to consider the softening of soil during the calculation in the calculation the new subgrade reaction modulus k s is obtained after a series of fdm calculation based on the new pile deflection y p and initial soil displacement y s if the difference between y p and y s exceeds the allowing error 0 5 k s instead of the original subgrade reaction modulus k s is substituted into eq 6 to carry out another series of calculation fig 3 in this way the pile shaft deflections can be solved with considering the non linear soil stress strain response in the following sections the active and passive methods based on api p y curves are adopted to analyze the responses of piles in two loading conditions a pile singly loaded by spudcan penetration and a pile subjected to a combination of the spudcan penetration and a lateral load on the pile head by comparison with the model test results the applicability of the two analyzing methods can be examined 3 numerical simulation of a centrifuge model test 3 1 brief description of the model test xie 2009 conducted a 100 g spudcan pile interaction centrifuge model test in clay where the pile is perfectly fixed head and only subjected to spudcan penetration during the test the spudcan advanced downwards to a final penetration depth of 15 m at an average displacement speed of over 1 2 mm s with the pile bending moment distributions monitored throughout the process malaysia kaolin clay with a specific gravity of 2 60 a liquid limit of 80 and a plastic limit of 35 was adopted in the test the kaolin clay slurry consolidated in 100 g in flight to reach a degree of consolidation of as high as 99 and its effective unit weight was taken as 6 kn m3 four t bar tests were conducted in flight and a best fitting of the variation of undrained shear strength with depth is given in eq 10 10 s u 2 1 5 z where s u is the undrained shear strength z is the depth below the seabed the to your a sand was air pluviated into the container and the dry density was 1 579 g cm3 in the model tests its effective unit weight was taken as 9 kn m3 other details of the test configuration are given in fig 4 the penetration depth in the test means the position of lower elevation of the largest diameter the steel pipe pile used in the test was 27 m long with an outer diameter of 1 26 m and a wall thickness of 0 038 m the soil movement was measured using the piv technique in an equivalent half model test where the soil movement at the pile position can be extracted 3 2 numerical model definition and key parameters the cel technique is then utilized to simulate the 0 25d spudcan diameter clearance condition and the calculated soil displacement profiles at different penetration depths will be obtained using a post processing code fig 5 gives the numerical model a quarter of the cylindrical soil domain is modeled to reduce calculation cost considering the axisymmetry of the test a fine mesh of 0 03d within the center 1 5d of the domain and a coarse mesh of 0 1d are established at the outer part besides other dimension settings of the soils and the spudcan completely established according to the test an additional 10 m high void area is set to allow for soil upheaval 8 noded brick element ec3d8r in abaqus is used to model the soil domain and 4 noded solid element c3d4 to model the spudcan respectively the interaction between the spudcan and clay was assumed to be frictionless in the tangential direction and allowed to separate at zero contact pressure in the normal direction lateral velocities are set as zero on the side boundaries and the vertical degree of freedom is restrained for the bottom boundary during numerical simulation the spudcan will advance at a speed of 0 2 m s which is proved to guarantee a pseudo static penetration process qiu and grabe 2012 to be consistent with step 2 where api p y data are adopted to obtain the pile response a necessary parameter ε 50 is considered in material settings as suggested by matlock 1970 ε 50 the axial strain at half of the yield stress should be considered according to the value of the latter and it is also suggested that ε 50 range from 0 5 to 2 for soft and stiff clay with undrained shear strength ranging from 12 to 96 kpa for very soft soils the value of ε 50 can be 6 two typical stress strain curves representing very soft clays with an ε 50 equal to 6 and stiff clays with an ε 50 of 1 are given by li et al 2015 in fig 6 considering that the undrained shear strength is only 2 kpa at the surface of the analyzing domain and increases linearly with the depth the clay at the seabed is established as the solid line representing the very soft soil and the bottom clay is set according to the dash line for a stiff soil in fig 6 the stress strain curves of the clay are then transformed into tabular material property parameters according to the multi stage isotropic hardening elasto plastic models obeying the mises yield criterion the model parameters include yield stress q the corresponding plastic strain ε elastic modulus e and the poisson ratio μ q ε can be directly derived from evenly distributed points on the curves fig 6 e is determined by the assumption that the materials initially yield at an axial strain of 0 25 ten subsequent yield stresses are input with corresponding strains for a better simulation of the curves before the final yield strength determined according to the curves abaqus will make auto interpolation for the intermediate soils also μ for the clay is taken as 0 49 to consider undrained condition an elastic perfectly plastic constitutive model obeying the mohr coulomb yield criterion is adopted to depict the stress strain relationship of the sand according to xie s research 2009 the elastic modulus e the poisson ratio μ and the internal friction angle θ are taken as 77mpa 0 3 and 32 respectively measured soil lateral movement profiles at different spudcan penetration depths are compared with simulated results in fig 7 the centrifuge model test results are represented by symbols and the results calculated by the cel method are drawn by solid lines the calculated results here agree well with the centrifuge model test however tho et al 2015 adopted the cel technique to analyze the model test and the results are dissimilar to the measured results especially in deep penetration depths fig 8 tho et al 2015 simply adopted a tresca constitutive model to depict clay behaviors with the elastic modulus of clay set as 150 times the undrained shear strength compared with the results predicted by tho et al 2015 the differences can be attributed to different soil model parameters especially the soil modulus 3 3 pile response calculation xie s centrifuge model test simulated a perfectly fixed pile head condition only applied with spudcan induced soil loads the pile shaft bending moments were measured during spudcan penetration according to the test results the bending moment and shear force at the pile tip are zero like a floating pile thus four boundary conditions can be given as follows and combined with the equation set 6 the pile response can be solved combined with equations 11 14 11 y p 3 0 12 y p 4 y p 2 0 13 y p n 4 2 y p n 3 y p n 2 0 14 y p n 5 2 y p n 4 2 y p n 2 y p n 1 0 it should be noted that the offset p y method cannot be applied to the perfect passive pile condition i e a pile singly loaded with the spudcan penetration therefore only the passive pile method is adopted to analyze the centrifuge model test for simplicity the resulting bending moment profiles at 3 different penetration depths 9 m 12 m and 15 m based on the cel method are then given in fig 9 4 validation of the procedure to analysis of the combined loading condition 4 1 model test description in order to further validate the procedure for analyzing the response of piles subjected to a combination of spudcan penetration and pile head loads an 1 g spudcan penetration tests in clay was carried out to investigate the responses of the adjacent piles and the soil displacement simultaneously tian 2016 the model test configuration is given in fig 10 the circular aluminum alloy pile was 12 3 mm in diameter with a wall thickness of 1 15 mm and 1 15 m in length the pile rigidity was 37 42 n m2 during all the tests pile was assumed as wished in place with an embedment depth of 0 9 m fig 10 the model spudcan was 18 cm in diameter and detailed dimensions are shown in fig 11 physical properties of the clay involved in the test were measured before the test its liquid limit was calibrated as 44 44 plastic limit as 27 01 and water content as 40 13 the unit weight was also taken as 7 83 kn m3 the disturbed clay was allowed to regain its strength for 4 days with the soil depth reaches 0 9 m vane shear tests were conducted in 9 target points before the model tests and a fitting linear function of undrained soil strength variation with depth is given by eq 15 15 s u 5 3 10 z then the instrumented pile and the soil displacement transducers were installed axisymmetrically at both sides of the spudcan along the long axis of the tank and after waiting for another 3 days the spudcan was penetrated and extracted at a constant speed of 0 1 mm s with soil displacements and pile responses constantly recorded similar to the currently commercial displacement transducer saa shape acceleration array which has an extensive usage in field displacement monitoring like embankment induced soil movement hendry et al 2013 a series of self developed hinge joint angle transducers fig 10 with a cross end to simulate a fixed condition was improved in aspects of dimension cross section and the joints to meet up with the requirements of precision and data density in the small scale testing condition in view of the research conducted by xie 2009 the effects of spudcan penetration mainly manifest itself in the lateral direction thus only the lateral soil displacement was investigated in the test although the transducers can only sense the displacements in the lateral direction the adoption of the soil displacement transducers is enough to replace the traditional piv technology to avoid additional half spudcan tests based on the assumption that the bottom displacement is zero the lateral soil displacement at a certain clearance from the spudcan can be easily calculated by measurement of the inclination angles of the transducers the soil displacement transducer series have eight 0 1 m long working elements and two 0 1 m long end elements on both sides fig 10 hinge joints allow for free rotation in the directions of both x and y within the horizontal plane but restrain rotation around the z axis with the advance of the spudcan the soil displacement transducers may deform with the soil and the 8 working elements may form vertical angles of θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 θ 4 θ 5 θ 6 θ 7 and θ 8 from bottom to top fig 10 the soil displacement at the location of each transducer can be calculated using eq 16 and in this way the distribution profile at a certain clearance from the spudcan can be obtained 16 u i k 0 i δ l tan θ k where u i is the lateral displacement at the top of the ith working element θ k is the vertical angle of the kth working element the 1 g model test simulated the condition of combined loading in which a lateral load of 25 n is applied to the perfectly free pile head 0 2 m above the soil surface before the spudcan penetration fig 10 4 2 soil displacement an quarter cel 3d model is established according to the test settings fig 12 the model is meshed in the same way of that of xie s model test a triaxial uu test was conducted on a soil sample taken from the soil box given that the soil depth is only 0 9 m the key parameter ε 50 is then considered as 5 uniformly in depth based on the stress strain curve see fig 13 both in the numerical model and in the second step an elastic multi hardening plastic constitutive model obeying the mises yield criterion is also adopted to depict the stress strain relationship of the clay soil displacement profiles at a clearance of 0 25d at 5 typical penetration depths were drawn as symbols in fig 14 and the numerical and measured results are compared which again proves to be similar 4 3 pile response bending moment was also recorded during the whole test according to the test settings the pile tip is assumed to be fixed in displacement and free in rotation and the pile head at the surface is perfectly free but with a shear force equal to 25 n and a bending moment of 25 0 2 n m as expressed in eqs 17 20 17 y p 5 2 y p 4 2 y p 2 y p 1 2 h δ 3 e i 18 y p 4 2 y p 3 y p 2 m δ 2 e i 19 y p n 4 2 y p n 3 y p n 2 0 20 y p n 5 2 y p n 4 2 y p n 2 y p n 1 0 where h equals to 25 n m equals to 5 n m and ei is the pile rigidity for the passive pile method the obtained soil displacement profiles are input directly into the parameter y s z to yield bending moment as for the offset p y method the p y curve at a certain depth will be adjusted by adding the soil displacement at the depth to the y axis to make the curve softer then the offset p y curve is combined with the lateral pile head load to calculate the corresponding bending moment profiles measured and calculated results at 5 penetration depths are given in fig 15 up to a spudcan penetration of 0 2 m the offset p y method tends to give a better simulation of the test while the passive pile method can predict the bending moment better when the spudcan advances deeper than 0 2 m the offset p y method constantly predicts active pile response which in shallow penetration depths is accurate enough because the lateral load on the pile head dominates the pile deformation however in deep penetration depths the pile response tends to become a mixture of active and passive pile behaviors and the passive pile method is accurate enough to predict the pile response 5 conclusions pile responses under combined loading of the spudcan penetration and the lateral pile head load are analyzed in two steps to investigate practical loading conditions of the offshore platform piles with jack up rigs operating in the proximity for the first step large soil displacements occurring during the spudcan penetration are difficult to evaluate by the conventional analytical solutions such as the cavity expansion method which in turn hinders the application of the two stage method to the calculation of pile response thus an appropriate and accurate soil displacement calculation method is first explored by post processing the cel technique and soil material parameters are investigated to form the first step to analyze the influence of spudcan penetration on the adjacent piles then the obtained soil displacements are input to the non linear foundation beam model both as a new set of offset p y data and as displacement itself in passive pile analysis both the soil displacements and the pile responses are compared to available model test results it is indicated that the two soil displacement calculation methods can both yield agreeable results for the first step as for the pile analysis in the second step the passive pile analysis is suitable for the pile analysis in the combined loading condition while the offset p y method can only give reliable solutions for active piles

cables are analyzed formulated and expressed in details the connection conditions between the floating structure and mooring cables are introduced to formulate the equations of motions of the system as a whole the vibrations of the floating structure under horizontal sinusoidal excitation are analyzed numerically the influence of different sag to span ratios or inclined angles of the mooring cables and that of different current velocities on the displacements of the floating structure and maximum tensile force in the cables are studied the displacement amplitudes of the moored floating structure and maximum cable tensile force under different current velocities are also studied for different excitation frequencies keywords nonlinear offshore floating structures mooring cable connection conditions 1 introduction large floating structures have been widely used in ocean engineering in the last few decades as they are financially economical can be constructed quickly and easily expanded and removed they are one of the most environmentally friendly innovations that allow for the creation of artificial land in the sea without destroying marine habitats or polluting coastal waters wang et al 2007 moored floating structures are one of the most popular types of offshore platforms and used to extract marine resources such as oil gas and minerals these structures consist of a floating platform and mooring cables if the floating platform is subjected to horizontal excitation its movement can induce changes in the mooring cable geometry consequently the geometric nonlinearity of the mooring cables may substantially affect the behavior of the floating platform due to their flexibility therefore the accurate modeling of mooring cables is crucial for carrying out the vibrational analysis of moored floating structures the mooring cables were simplified as linear springs by some researches yamamoto et al 1980 sannasiraj et al 1998 tang et al 2011 the slack mooring cables were modeled as linear springs to support the floating platform the stiffness coefficients are derived from the catenary equations of the cables after the spring constants are determined they are added to the linear stiffness in the equations of motion of the floating platform the advantage of this approach is that it is more convenient and efficient for numerical analysis but the results lack accuracy because the behaviors of the cables cannot be well reflected simply by the linear springs this kind of structure has also been modeled as a rigid mass connected to nonlinear springs esmailzadeh and goodarzi 2001 agarwal and jain 2003 umar and datta 2003 rosales and filipich 2006 the dynamic tension from the mooring cables that acts on the floating platform is taken into consideration based on the geometry of the catenary chains and expressed with nonlinear terms in terms of the displacement velocity and acceleration of the floating platform the vibration of the mooring cables was analyzed by using the lumped mass model for a more accurate analysis of the moored floating structure huang 1994 masciola et al 2012 zhu and yoo 2015 2016 with this approach the cables are divided into sections which are connected by nodes and equilibrium equations are directly formulated at each node mooring cables have also been modeled by using a bar element as proposed by garrett 1982 2005 or a bar element combined with an updated lagrangian formulation gutiérrez romero et al 2016 the two node catenary cable element was formulated based on the exact analytical geometry of elastic catenary and the tangent stiffness matrix was derived o brien and francis 1964 jayaraman and knudson 1981 yang and tsay 2007 the finite element method was used to model the mooring cables based on the principle of minimum energy which incorporates the strain energy due to tension bending and torsion kim et al 2010 2013 the equations of motions of both the mooring cables and the floating platform are solved separately and iteratively with this approach the tensile forces applied on the platform by the cables are used to update the equations of motions of the floating platform and then the displacements of the floating platform are used to update the boundary conditions of the mooring cables iteratively until the solution converges at each time step in view that the mooring lines behavior more like cables the full stiffness matrix of the cable element is formulated in this paper the advantage of using nonlinear cable element rather than nonlinear beam element is that the computational effort can be much reduced the cable element is formulated based on the extended hamilton principle pai 2007 and the nonlinear stiffness matrix rather than the tangent nonlinear stiffness matrix of the cable is derived and expressed explicitly in order to formulate the equations of motion of the system wang et al 2016 the exact catenary profile of the mooring cables in the static state is determined for a given sag which is referred to as the cable s initial state the modeling of the floating platform is simplified as a rigid body with three degrees of freedom i e two translational displacements and one rotational displacement the hydrodynamic drag forces are taken into consideration and applied to both the mooring cables and the floating platform the connection conditions between the floating platform and the mooring cables are introduced in deriving the equations of motion for both the floating platform and the mooring cables as a whole the nonlinear equations of motion of the whole system are then solved by the fourth order runge kutta method the derived cable element was validated by comparing the results from the cable element to those from other methods o brien and francis 1964 jayaraman and knudson 1981 yang and tsay 2007 the correctness of the solution procedure and the obtained internal forces is validated by examining the equilibrium conditions at the nodes of the system after that the displacements of the moored floating structures and the maximum tensile force in cables are investigated for different current velocities sag to span ratios and inclined angles of the mooring cables the displacements of the moored floating structure and the maximum tensile force in the cables are also studied with different excitation frequencies and current velocities to identify the critical performances of the structure 2 statement of the problem consider a two dimensional moored floating structure as shown in fig 1 the structure consists of a floating platform and two catenary mooring cables c 1 and c 2 the upper ends of the mooring cables are connected to the floating platform at two points a and b respectively the lower ends of the mooring cables are fixed on the sea bed c 1 and c 2 are assumed to be symmetric about the y axis in static state this model can be used to analyze the vibrations of the moored platform when there is a vertical symmetrical plane and the vibration is in this symmetrical plane as shown in fig 1 l is the length between the two ends of each mooring cable θ and d are the inclined angle and the maximum sag of the mooring cables respectively d is the center of mass of the floating platform w d and h b are the length and height of the floating platform respectively h s is the submerged height of the floating platform in the sea in static state h is the depth of the sea the modeling of the floating platform is simplified as a rigid body with three degrees of freedom i e the displacements at d in the x and y directions and the rotation in the x o y plane about d 2 1 catenary profile of mooring cables in static state the initial profile of the mooring cables in static state is governed by the pretension and self weight of the cables the exact catenary profile of the cable is required for a given sag to span ratio d l in the following analysis as shown in fig 2 the following static equilibrium equations in the x and y directions are derived based on the equilibrium of the elements as shown in fig 3 1 f x 0 s t x s 0 2 f y 0 s t y s ρ a g where x and y are the coordinates of a point in the cables in static state due to both the self weight of the cables and pretension in the cable t is the tension in the cable in static state h is the horizontal component of the cable tension in static state s is the coordinate along the cable length in static state ρ is the mass density of the cable a is the cross section area of the cables a location parameter a is introduced which satisfies d y d x x a 0 solving eq 2 with the boundary condition y x 0 0 and the introduced condition d y d x x a 0 gives the catenary profile of the cables as follows 3 y h ρ a g cosh ρ a g h x a h ρ a g cosh ρ a g a h substituting the boundary condition y x l cos θ l sin θ into eq 3 gives 4 h ρ a g cosh ρ a g h l cos θ a h ρ a g cosh ρ a g a h l sin θ since y 1 x tan θ as shown in fig 2 it gives 5 y 2 y y 1 h ρ a g cosh ρ a g h x a h ρ a g cosh ρ a g a h x tan θ with d y 2 d x 0 y 2 obtains its maximum value when x a h ρ a g asinh tan θ as follows 6 y 2 m a x h ρ a g cosh asinh tan θ h ρ a g cosh ρ a g a h tan θ a h ρ a g asinh tan θ therefore the maximum sag can be expressed as d y 2 m a x cos θ and the sag to span ratio is derived as 7 d l cos θ l h ρ a g cosh asinh tan θ h ρ a g cosh ρ a g a h tan θ a h ρ a g asinh tan θ eqs 4 and 7 can be solved for three unknowns h a and d if one of them is given therefore the catenary profiles of c 1 and c 2 in fig 1 can be determined and expressed by eqs 8 and 9 respectively as 8 y h ρ 1 a g cosh ρ 1 a g h x w d 2 a h ρ 1 a g cosh ρ 1 a g a h 9 y h ρ 1 a g cosh ρ 1 a g h x w d 2 a h ρ 1 a g cosh ρ 1 a g a h where ρ 1 ρ ρ s and ρ s is the mass density of the sea water 2 2 static equilibrium of floating platform with reference to fig 4 the vertical equilibrium of the floating platform in static state gives 10 m g 2 f v f f in fig 4 f h and f v are the x axis and y axis components of the pretensions in the mooring cables respectively m is the mass of the floating platform f f is the buoyancy of the floating platform in the sea and expressed by f f ρ s g h s w d b in which b is the width of the floating platform 3 nonlinear dynamical analysis of moored floating platform the equations of motions of the mooring cables and floating platform are derived separately first after that the connection conditions between the mooring cables and floating platform are formulated in the last the two groups of equations are grouped together through the connection conditions 3 1 finite element formulation of vibrational cables the nonlinear elementary stiffness matrix of cable element is formulated based on the extended hamilton principle first and then the equations of motion of the mooring cables are formulated with the cable elements in the following consider a differential cable element in dynamic state as shown in fig 5 d s and d s denote the length of the differential element in static and dynamic states respectively u and v denote the dynamic displacements in the x and y directions respectively then d s d x 2 d y 2 1 2 11 d s d x d u 2 d y d v 2 1 2 retaining the terms up to the second order the axial strain of the cables is given by 12 ε

loads per unit length along the x and y directions respectively and c 1 and c 2 are the damping coefficients per unit length along the x and y directions respectively substituting eq 14 into eq 15 the variation of the potential energy can be expressed as 18 δ π 0 l e a ε δ u x u δ v y v t δ u x u δ v y v d s with eqs 16 18 and introducing eqs 1 and 2 into t 1 t 2 δ k δ π δ w d t 0 we have 19 t 1 t

of element e and d e is the displacement vector of element e in the global coordinate system of the cables the linear shape function of element e is 22 n e n 1 0 n 2 0 0 n 1 0 n 2 where n 1 1 s l e n

f t in the horizontal direction as stated above three degrees of freedom of the floating platform are considered in the analysis which are the horizontal displacement u d in the x axis vertical displacement v d in the y axis and rotation α about d respectively α is assumed to be small and then sin α tan α α the equations of motion of the floating platform are given in the following 37 f x 0

f f d f f d 1 and f f d 2 are the dynamic buoyant forces of the floating platform due to the changes in the submerged volume of the floating platform and expressed as f f d ρ s g a b v d 40 f f d 1 f f d 2 1 8 ρ s g a b w d α f h a f v a f h b and f v b are induced by the displacements of the cable elements that are connected to the floating platform with reference to fig 9 the drag forces or

connection conditions between them are required the relationships between the horizontal and vertical displacements at nodes a b and d are 47 u a u d h b 2 α u b u d h b 2 α v a v d w d 2 α v b v d w d 2 α where u a u b v a and v b are the horizontal and vertical displacements of the nodes a and b respectively then the equations of motion related to the nodes a and b in eq 36 are removed and the other equations are combined with eqs 37 39 by the connection conditions eq 47 to formulate a system of equations of motion for both the cables and the floating platform as a whole the variables u a u b v a and v b in the other equations of motion in eq 36 are also expressed in terms of u d v d and α by using eq 47 thus the final equations of motion of the whole system are expressed as 48 m u c u k u u f t where u is the global displacement vector of the whole system k u is the global stiffness matrix of the whole system f t is the external force vector c is rayleigh damping matrix used in the numerical analysis and expressed as 49 c a 0 m a 1 k l in which a 0 2 ξ ω m ω n ω m ω n and a 1 2 ξ ω m ω n with ξ being the damping ratio ω m being the fundamental natural frequency and ω n being the highest natural frequency of the system without considering the effect of nonlinearity 4 numerical example the parameter values of the mooring cables and floating platform are shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively consider the following case the density of the sea water is ρ s 1 025 10 3 kg m3 the current velocity is w 0 m s the x axis and y axis components of the pretensions in the mooring lines in static state are obtained as f h 7 0561 10 4 n and f v 8 5694 10 4 n respectively the submerged height h s of the floating structure in the sea in static state is calculated with eq 10 and found to be 1 5486 m the floating platform is subjected to a simple periodic force in the form of sinusoidal function f t f 1 sin ω t with the amplitude f 1 being 8 10 4 n each mooring cable is discretized into 11 elements because the results cannot be further improved obviously if more than 11 elements are used for each cable the system starts to move from the static state some of the numerical results are shown in figs 10 and 11 with θ 45 d l 1 35 and ω 1 15 rad s in this case it results in the maximum response of the floating platform the time history of the horizontal displacement of the floating platform is shown in fig 10 the time history of the cable tensile force at the connection node a is shown in fig 11 the time history of the cable tensile force at steady state at the connection node b is the same as that at a except their phase difference in view that the amplitude of the vertical displacement of the floating platform is about 0 26 m in the extremal case which is much smaller than that of the horizontal displacement the numerical results are not presented in the following analysis the depth of the sea h remains unchanged the response amplitudes of the floating platform and the maximum tensile force in the cables at steady state are presented in figs 12 14 respectively for different values of sag to span ratio and different current velocities when the excitation frequency equals 1 15 rad s and the inclined angle equals 45 it can be seen from fig 12 that the horizontal displacement of the floating platform at steady state increases as the sag to span ratio is reduced from 1 24 to 1 30 under the same current velocity after that the horizontal displacement decreases as the sag to span ratio is reduced from 1 30 to 1 46 it can be observed from figs 13 and 14 that the rotational angle of the floating platform and the maximum cable tensile force at steady state increase as the sag to span ratio is reduced from 1 24 to 1 32 under the same current velocity after that they decrease as the sag to span ratio is reduced from 1 32 to 1 46 the response amplitudes of the floating platform and the maximum cable tensile force can be quite large when the sag to span ratio of the cables in static state is around 1 30 to 1 34 which needs being avoided during structural design it is also seen from figs 12 14 that the current velocities significantly affect the response amplitudes of the floating platform and maximum cable tensile force the maximum responses and cable tensile force are reached when w 0 m s in the resonance state the response amplitudes of the floating platform and the maximum cable tensile force at steady state are shown in figs 15 17 respectively for different value of inclined angle θ of cable and different current velocities when the excitation frequency equals 1 15 rad s and the sag to span ratio remains to be 1 35 it can be seen from figs 15 and 16 that the response amplitudes of the floating platform at steady state increase as the inclined angle is increased from 36 to 48 under the same current velocity after that they decrease as the inclined angle is increased from 48 to 56 it can be observed from fig 17 that the maximum cable tensile force at steady state increases as the inclined angle is increased from 36 to 46 under the same current velocity after that it decreases as the inclined angle is increased from 46 to 56 the response amplitudes of the floating platform and the maximum cable tensile force can be quite large when the inclined angle of the cable in static state is around 46 to 48 which therefore needs to be taken into consideration during structural design it can also be seen from figs 15 17 that the maximum responses and cable tensile force are observed when w 0 m s in the resonance state the response amplitudes of the floating platform and the maximum cable tensile force at steady state for different values of excitation frequency ω and current velocity w are shown in figs 18 20 respectively the excitation frequency ω is increased from 0 5 to 3 rad s and the values of current velocity are selected as 0 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m s respectively it can be observed from figs 18 20 that the responses of the floating platform and the maximum cable tensile force reach their peak values for each current velocity when the excitation frequency is around 1 15 rad s which can be considered as the critical resonance frequency of the whole system it can also be seen from figs 18 20 that the responses of the floating platform and the maximum cable tensile force decrease as the current velocity is increased from 0 to 0 6 m s around the resonance frequency 5 conclusions the nonlinear vibrations in its vertical symmetrical plane of a floating structure moored by cables are analyzed in this study the floating platform is modeled as a rigid body with three degrees of freedom the mooring cables are modeled with nonlinear cable elements which are formulated with the extended hamilton principle the external forces that act on the floating platform and the hydrodynamic drag forces that act on both the cables and floating platform are taken into consideration and formulated rationally the connection conditions between the mooring cables and the floating platform are introduced to derive the nonlinear equations of motions of both the mooring cables and floating platform as a whole then the equations of motion of the system are solved numerically as a whole comparing to the conventional method by analyzing the cables and platform separately and iteratively formulating and analyzing the nonlinear system as a whole can make the computational effort much reduced because the iterations are not needed the nonlinear dynamical behaviors of the floating platform and the cables are then analyzed in details the effects of the mooring cables on the responses of the moored floating structure are examined for different values of sag to span ratio or inclined angle of the mooring cables the effects of the current velocity and the excitation frequency on the responses of the moored floating structure are also studied it is found from the numerical analysis that the initial sag to span ratio and the inclined angle of the mooring cables in static state have much influence on the dynamic displacement and rotation of the floating platform and the cable tensile forces it could be dangerous for this kind of moored floating structure when the sag to span ratio and inclined angle of mooring cables are in some ranges the nonlinear resonance frequency of the moored floating structure is identified with frequency response analysis acknowledgement the results presented in this paper were obtained under the supports of the research committee of university of

23472,in this study a numerical model is presented for the nonlinear vibrational analysis in the symmetrical plane of the rectangular offshore floating structures moored by cables the upper end of each mooring cable is connected to the floating structure and the other end is fixed to the sea bed the nonlinear equations of motions of the mooring cables are derived by using nonlinear cable

structure and maximum cable tensile force under different current velocities are also studied for different excitation frequencies keywords nonlinear offshore floating structures mooring cable connection conditions 1 introduction large floating structures have been widely used in ocean engineering in the last few decades as they are financially economical can be constructed quickly and easily expanded and removed they are one of the most environmentally friendly innovations that allow for the creation of artificial land in the sea without destroying marine habitats or polluting coastal waters wang et al 2007 moored floating structures are one of the most popular types of offshore platforms and used to extract marine resources such as oil gas and minerals these structures consist of a floating platform and mooring cables if the floating platform is subjected to horizontal excitation its movement can induce changes in the mooring cable geometry consequently the geometric nonlinearity of the mooring cables may substantially affect the behavior of the floating platform due to their flexibility therefore the accurate modeling of mooring cables is crucial for carrying out the vibrational analysis of moored floating structures the mooring cables were simplified as linear springs by some researches yamamoto et al 1980 sannasiraj et al 1998 tang et al 2011 the slack mooring cables were modeled as linear springs to support the floating platform the stiffness coefficients are derived from the catenary equations of the cables after the spring constants are determined they are added to the linear stiffness in the equations of motion of the floating platform the advantage of this approach is that it is more convenient and efficient for numerical analysis but the results lack accuracy because the behaviors of the cables cannot be well reflected simply by the linear springs this kind of structure has also been modeled as a rigid mass connected to nonlinear springs esmailzadeh and goodarzi 2001 agarwal and jain 2003 umar and datta 2003 rosales and filipich 2006 the dynamic tension from the mooring cables that acts on the floating platform is taken into consideration based on the geometry of the catenary chains and expressed with nonlinear terms in terms of the displacement velocity and acceleration of the floating platform the vibration of the mooring cables was analyzed by using the lumped mass model for a more accurate analysis of the moored floating structure huang 1994 masciola et al 2012 zhu and yoo 2015 2016 with this approach the cables are divided into sections which are connected by nodes and equilibrium equations are directly formulated at each node mooring cables have also been modeled by using a bar element as proposed by garrett 1982 2005 or a bar element combined with an updated lagrangian formulation gutiérrez romero et al 2016 the two node catenary cable element was formulated based on the exact analytical geometry of elastic catenary and the tangent stiffness matrix was derived o brien and francis 1964 jayaraman and knudson 1981 yang and tsay 2007 the finite element method was used to model the mooring cables based on the principle of minimum energy which incorporates the strain energy due to tension bending and torsion kim et al 2010 2013 the equations of motions of both the mooring cables and the floating platform are solved separately and iteratively with this approach the tensile forces applied on the platform by the cables are used to update the equations of motions of the floating platform and then the displacements of the floating platform are used to update the boundary conditions of the mooring cables iteratively until the solution converges at each time step in view that the mooring lines behavior more like cables the full stiffness matrix of the cable element is formulated in this paper the advantage of using nonlinear cable element rather than nonlinear beam element is that the computational effort can be much reduced the cable element is formulated based on the extended hamilton principle pai 2007 and the nonlinear stiffness matrix rather than the tangent nonlinear stiffness matrix of the cable is derived and expressed explicitly in order to formulate the equations of motion of the system wang et al 2016 the exact catenary profile of the mooring cables in the static state is determined for a given sag which is referred to as the cable s initial state the modeling of the floating platform is simplified as a rigid body with three degrees of freedom i e two translational displacements and one rotational displacement the hydrodynamic drag forces are taken into consideration and applied to both the mooring cables and the floating platform the connection conditions between the floating platform and the mooring cables are introduced in deriving the equations of motion for both the floating platform and the mooring cables as a whole the nonlinear equations of motion of the whole system are then solved by the fourth order runge kutta method the derived cable element was validated by comparing the results from the cable element to those from other methods o brien and francis 1964 jayaraman and knudson 1981 yang and tsay 2007 the correctness of the solution procedure and the obtained internal forces is validated by examining the equilibrium conditions at the nodes of the system after that the displacements of the moored floating structures and the maximum tensile force in cables are investigated for different current velocities sag to span ratios and inclined angles of the mooring cables the displacements of the moored floating structure and the maximum tensile force in the cables are also studied with different excitation frequencies and current velocities to identify the critical performances of the structure 2 statement of the problem consider a two dimensional moored floating structure as shown in fig 1 the structure consists of a floating platform and two catenary mooring cables c 1 and c 2 the upper ends of the mooring cables are connected to the floating platform at two points a and b respectively the lower ends of the mooring cables are fixed on the sea bed c 1 and c 2 are assumed to be symmetric about the y axis in static state this model can be used to analyze the vibrations of the moored platform when there is a vertical symmetrical plane and the vibration is in this symmetrical plane as shown in fig 1 l is the length between the two ends of each mooring cable θ and d are the inclined angle and the maximum sag of the mooring cables respectively d is the center of mass of the floating platform w d and h b are the length and height of the floating platform respectively h s is the submerged height of the floating platform in the sea in static state h is the depth of the sea the modeling of the floating platform is simplified as a rigid body with three degrees of freedom i e the displacements at d in the x and y directions and the rotation in the x o y plane about d 2 1 catenary profile of mooring cables in static state the initial profile of the mooring cables in static state is governed by the pretension and self weight of the cables the exact catenary profile of the cable is required for a given sag to span ratio d l in the following analysis as shown in fig 2 the following static equilibrium equations in the x and y directions are derived based on the equilibrium of the elements as shown in fig 3 1 f x 0 s t x s 0 2 f y 0 s t y s ρ a g where x and y are the coordinates of a point in the cables in static state due to both the self weight of the cables and pretension in the cable t is the tension in the cable in static state h is the horizontal component of the cable tension in static state s is the coordinate along the cable length in static state ρ is the mass density of the cable a is the cross section area of the cables a location parameter a is introduced which satisfies d y d x x a 0 solving eq 2 with the boundary condition y x 0 0 and the introduced condition d y d x x a 0 gives the catenary profile of the cables as follows 3 y h ρ a g cosh ρ a g h x a h ρ a g cosh ρ a g a h substituting the boundary condition y x l cos θ l sin θ into eq 3 gives 4 h ρ a g cosh ρ a g h l cos θ a h ρ a g cosh ρ a g a h l sin θ since y 1 x tan θ as shown in fig 2 it gives 5 y 2 y y 1 h ρ a g cosh ρ a g h x a h ρ a g cosh ρ a g a h x tan θ with d y 2 d x 0 y 2 obtains its maximum value when x a h ρ a g asinh tan θ as follows 6 y 2 m a x h ρ a g cosh asinh tan θ h ρ a g cosh ρ a g a h tan θ a h ρ a g asinh tan θ therefore the maximum sag can be expressed as d y 2 m a x cos θ and the sag to span ratio is derived as 7 d l cos θ l h ρ a g cosh asinh tan θ h ρ a g cosh ρ a g a h tan θ a h ρ a g asinh tan θ eqs 4 and 7 can be solved for three unknowns h a and d if one of them is given therefore the catenary profiles of c

loads per unit length along the x and y directions respectively and c 1 and c 2 are the damping coefficients per unit length along the x and y directions respectively substituting eq 14 into eq 15 the variation of the potential energy can be expressed as 18 δ π 0 l e a ε δ u x u δ v y v t δ u x u δ v y v d s with eqs 16 18 and introducing eqs 1 and 2 into t 1 t 2 δ k δ π δ w d t 0 we have 19 t 1 t

sea are affected by persistent hydrodynamic drag forces by using morison s equation the drag forces are expressed as a quadratic function of the relative velocity between the cable element and the surrounding current let d l e u i l v i l u j l v j l t be the displacement vector of element e in the local coordinate system of the cable element as shown in fig 6 d l e is related to d e by d l e t d e where t is the transformation matrix between the local and global coordinate systems and expressed as follows 30 t cos ϕ sin ϕ 0 0 sin ϕ cos ϕ 0 0 0 0 cos ϕ sin ϕ 0 0 sin ϕ cos ϕ where ϕ is the angle between the global and local coordinate systems which takes a positive value in the clockwise direction and vice versa with morison s equation the drag forces f l e and f n e that act in the longitudinal and transverse directions of element e are given by 31 f l e π 2 ρ s c d l d l e u e w u 2 sgn u e w u f n e 1 2 ρ s c d n d l e v e w v 2 sgn v e w v where c d l and c d n are the drag

and v e are the average velocities of element e in the longitudinal and transverse directions respectively and expressed as 32 u e u i l u j l 2 v e v i l v j l 2 and sgn denotes the sign function given by 33 sgn z 1 z 0 0 z 0 1 z 0 the drag force f e that acts on element e in the global coordinate system is then expressed as 34 f e t t 1 2 f l e f n e f l e f n e t substituting eqs 21 25 and

mooring cable 3 2 validation of the cable element consider a suspended cable hanging between two supports at the same elevation as shown in fig 7 the length between two supports are l 304 8 m the maximum sag at mid span is d 30 48 m the mass density of cable is ρ 8 5775 10 3 kg m3 the young s modulus of cable is e 1 31 10 11 n m2 the cross sectional area of cable is a 5 4825 10 4 m2 the cable is subjected to a concentrated load f 3 5586 10 4 n which locates at l 1 121 92 m from the left support the horizontal and vertical displacements at the loaded point are calculated by using the cable element formulated in this paper and compared with the existing results o brien and francis 1964 jayaraman and knudson 1981 yang and tsay 2007 as shown in table 1 the good agreement of these results is observed 3 3 dynamics of floating platform with reference to fig 8 the equations of motion of the floating platform are given as follows when the floating platform is subjected to an external force f t in the horizontal direction as stated above three degrees of freedom of the floating platform are considered in the analysis which are the horizontal displacement u d in the x axis vertical displacement v d in the y axis and rotation α about d respectively α is assumed to be small and then sin α tan α α the equations of motion of the floating platform are given in the following 37 f x 0 m u d c 3 u d f d u f h a f h b f t 38 f y 0 m v d c 4 v d f f d f f f f d 1 f d v f v a f v b f f d 2 m g 2 f v 0 39 m d 0 i α c 5 α m d f h a h b 2 w d 2 α f h b h b 2 w d 2 α f v a w d 2 h b 2 α f

platform c 3 c 4 and c 5 are the damping coefficients for the motions in the x y and rotational directions respectively i is the moment of inertia of the floating platform which equals m w d 2 h b 2 12 f d u f d v and m d are the hydrodynamic drag forces or moment that act on the floating platform in the x y and the rotational directions respectively which are determined in the following f h a and f v a are the horizontal and vertical dynamic tensions from the cable at node a respectively f h b and f v b are the horizontal and vertical dynamic tensions from the cable at node b respectively f f d f f d 1 and f f d 2 are the dynamic buoyant forces of the floating platform due to the changes in the submerged volume of the floating platform and expressed as f f d ρ s g a b v d 40 f f d 1 f f d 2 1 8 ρ s g a b w d α f h a f v a f h b and f v b are induced by the displacements of the cable elements that are connected to the floating platform with reference to fig 9 the drag forces or

respectively w 1 w 2 and w 3 are expressed as follows 44 w 1 1 2 ρ s c d u h b 2 α w 2 sgn h b 2 α w 45 w 2 1 2 ρ s c d u h b 2 h s v d α v d α w 2 sgn h b 2 h s v d α v d α w 46 w 3 1 2 ρ s c d v w d 2 α 2 sgn w d 2 α 3 4 connection conditions between mooring cables and floating platform in order to derive the equations of motion of the mooring cables and the floating platform as a whole the connection conditions between them are required the relationships between the horizontal and vertical displacements at nodes a b and d are 47 u a u d h b 2 α u b u d h b 2 α v a v d w d 2 α v b v d w d 2 α where u a u b v a and v b are the horizontal and vertical displacements of the nodes a and b respectively then the equations of motion related to the nodes a and b in eq 36 are removed and the other equations are combined with eqs 37 39 by the connection conditions eq 47 to formulate a system of equations of motion for both the cables and the floating platform as a whole the variables u a u b v a and v b in the other equations of motion in eq 36 are also expressed in terms of u d v d and α by using eq 47 thus the final equations of motion of the whole system are expressed as 48 m u c u k u u f t where u is the global displacement vector of the whole system k u is the global stiffness matrix of the whole system f t is the external force vector c is rayleigh damping matrix used in the numerical analysis and expressed as 49 c a 0 m a 1 k l in which a 0 2 ξ ω m ω n ω m ω n and a 1 2 ξ ω m ω n with ξ being the damping ratio ω m being the fundamental natural frequency and ω n being the highest natural frequency of the system without considering the effect of nonlinearity 4 numerical example the parameter values of the mooring cables and floating platform are shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively consider the following case the density of the sea water is ρ s 1 025 10 3 kg m3 the current velocity is w 0 m s the x axis and y axis components of the pretensions in the mooring lines in static state are obtained as f h 7 0561 10 4 n and f v 8 5694 10 4 n respectively the submerged height h s of the floating structure in the sea in static state is calculated with eq 10 and found to be 1 5486 m the floating platform is subjected to a simple periodic force in the form of sinusoidal function f t f 1 sin ω t with the amplitude f 1 being 8 10 4 n each mooring cable is discretized into 11 elements because the results cannot be further improved obviously if more than 11 elements are used for each cable the system starts to move from the static state some of the numerical results are shown in figs 10 and 11 with θ 45 d l 1 35 and ω 1 15 rad s in this case it results in the maximum response of the floating platform the time history of the horizontal displacement of the floating platform is shown in fig 10 the time history of the cable tensile force at the connection node a is shown in fig 11 the time history of the cable tensile force at steady state at the connection node b is the same as that at a except their phase difference in view that the amplitude of the vertical displacement of the floating platform is about 0 26 m in the extremal case which is much smaller than that of the horizontal displacement the numerical results are not presented in the following analysis the depth of the sea h remains unchanged the response amplitudes of the floating platform and the maximum tensile force in the cables at steady state are presented in figs 12 14 respectively for different values of sag to span ratio and different current velocities when the excitation frequency equals 1 15 rad s and the inclined angle equals 45 it can be seen from fig 12 that the horizontal displacement of the floating platform at steady state increases as the sag to span ratio is reduced from 1 24 to 1 30 under the same current velocity after that the horizontal displacement decreases as the sag to span ratio is reduced from 1 30 to 1 46 it can be observed from figs 13 and 14 that the rotational angle of the floating platform and the maximum cable tensile force at steady state increase as the sag to span ratio is reduced from 1 24 to 1 32 under the same current velocity after that they decrease as the sag to span ratio is reduced from 1 32 to 1 46 the response amplitudes of the floating platform and the maximum cable tensile force can be quite large when the sag to span ratio of the cables in static state is around 1 30 to 1 34 which needs being avoided during structural design it is also seen from figs 12 14 that the current velocities significantly affect the response amplitudes of the floating platform and maximum cable tensile force the maximum responses and cable tensile force are reached when w 0 m s in the resonance state the response amplitudes of the floating platform and the maximum cable tensile force at steady state are shown in figs 15 17 respectively for different value of inclined angle θ of cable and different current velocities when the excitation frequency equals 1 15 rad s and the sag to span ratio remains to be 1 35 it can be seen from figs 15 and 16 that the response amplitudes of the floating platform at steady state increase as the inclined angle is increased from 36 to 48 under the same current velocity after that they decrease as the inclined angle is increased from 48 to 56 it can be observed from fig 17 that the maximum cable tensile force at steady state increases as the inclined angle is increased from 36 to 46 under the same current velocity after that it decreases as the inclined angle is increased from 46 to 56 the response amplitudes of the floating platform and the maximum cable tensile force can be quite large when the inclined angle of the cable in static state is around 46 to 48 which therefore needs to be taken into consideration during structural design it can also be seen from figs 15 17 that the maximum responses and cable tensile force are observed when w 0 m s in the resonance state the response amplitudes of the floating platform and the maximum cable tensile force at steady state for different values of excitation frequency ω and current velocity w are shown in figs 18 20 respectively the excitation frequency ω is increased from 0 5 to 3 rad s and the values of current velocity are selected as 0 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m s respectively it can be observed from figs 18 20 that the responses of the floating platform and the maximum cable tensile force reach their peak values for each current velocity when the excitation frequency is around 1 15 rad s which can be considered as the critical resonance frequency of the whole system it can also be seen from figs 18 20 that the responses of the floating platform and the maximum cable tensile force decrease as the current velocity is increased from 0 to 0 6 m s around the resonance frequency 5 conclusions the nonlinear vibrations in its vertical symmetrical plane of a floating structure moored by cables are analyzed in this study the floating platform is modeled as a rigid body with three degrees of freedom the mooring cables are modeled with nonlinear cable elements which are formulated with the extended hamilton principle the external forces that act on the floating platform and the hydrodynamic drag forces that act on both the cables and floating platform are taken into consideration and formulated rationally the connection conditions between the mooring cables and the floating platform are introduced to derive the nonlinear equations of motions of both the mooring cables and floating platform as a whole then the equations of motion of the system are solved numerically as a whole comparing to the conventional method by analyzing the cables and platform separately and iteratively formulating and analyzing the nonlinear system as a whole can make the computational effort much reduced because the iterations are not needed the nonlinear dynamical behaviors of the floating platform and the cables are then analyzed in details the effects of the mooring cables on the responses of the moored floating structure are examined for different values of sag to span ratio or inclined angle of the mooring cables the effects of the current velocity and the excitation frequency on the responses of the moored floating structure are also studied it is found from the numerical analysis that the initial sag to span ratio and the inclined angle of the mooring cables in static state have much influence on the dynamic displacement and rotation of the floating platform and the cable tensile forces it could be dangerous for this kind of moored floating structure when the sag to span ratio and inclined angle of mooring cables are in some ranges the nonlinear resonance frequency of the moored floating structure is identified with frequency response analysis acknowledgement the results presented in this paper were obtained under the supports of the research committee of university of

23473,this study introduces a new method named inaction method also referred to as a line pass filter in the filtering language for predicting short term tidal levels the inaction method which is based on normal time frequency transform ntft theory can recognize and extract harmonic quasi harmonic components of a tidal signal without an inverse transform conventional methods decompose tidal levels into a series of harmonic constituents and each constituent has its own fixed amplitude and frequency instead of those harmonic parameters the inaction method enables the user to directly and exactly recover the harmonic with instantaneous amplitude frequency and phase apply this method more than once can reduce edge effect and retrieve instantaneous harmonic information based on instantaneous harmonic information extracted tidal constituents then can be used to predict future tidal levels unlike harmonic analysis which always requires a long period of tidal level record to make sure an accurate prediction inaction method can use short term data in addition the conventional method require a tide table to determine frequencies while the proposed method does not tide gauge measurements from quarry bay hong kong are tested in this study results demonstrate the capacity of the inaction method to generate short term tidal level forecast based on correlation coefficient 0 92 0 99 root mean square error about 4 8 of the tidal range keywords normal time frequency transform harmonic analysis inaction method tidal level prediction short term edge effect 1 introduction due to the significance of marine ecosystems for economics today it is important to research sea level heights in the near shore environment particularly knowledge of future near shore sea level is essential for planning coastal structures harbors bay estuary engineering or biological resources management the variation in near shore sea level is mainly due to the rise and fall of the tides the most popular method for tidal level prediction has been classical harmonic analysis which was developed by kelvin improved by darwin 1892 doodson 1921 and other researchers these studies were based on the fact that tides are a periodic phenomenon that can be expressed as the superposition of several sinusoidal functions each sinusoidal function has three parameters to be determined amplitude frequency and phase many different tidal tables have been created by extracting the tide generating potential from known orbital periodicities of the earth moon sun system including those presented by doodson 1928 cartwright and tayler 1971 cartwright and edden 1973 xi and hou 1987 hartmann and wenzel 1994 hartmann and wenzel 1995 and roosbeek 1996 with these known frequencies the remaining parameters can be calculated by the least squares method continuous wavelet transform cwt a satisfactory tool for non stationary signal time frequency analysis also can be used to extract tidal information for instance jay and flinchem 1997 flinchem and jay 2000 and jay and kukulka 2003 applied cwt to analysis the river tides which vary rapidly over time erol 2011 compared wavelet analysis and least squares spectral analysis for tide gauge sensor data however all studies focused on the utility of cwt for non stationary signal analysis this study will show that cwt can be used for harmonic analysis without inverse transform by resorting to l1 norm normalization morlet wavelet transform because it is an observation based method inaction method in this study was presented to extract tidal constituents based on observation for which the frequencies amplitudes and phases are assumed to be unknown i e tidal table haven t been used this method can extract the harmonic quasi harmonic a signal having slowly varying magnitudes or slightly varying frequencies components of the signal directly via time frequency transform without the need for an inverse transform other methods such as harmonic analysis and fourier transform all obtain a series of parameters but the inaction method enables the user to extract harmonic quasi harmonic components with instantaneous amplitude frequency and phase in other words the inaction method is able to make prediction using instantaneous information while other methods cannot a normal time frequency transform ntft liu and hsu 2012 need to be constructed before apply inaction method we used a normal morlet wavelet transform nmwt a special ntft in tidal time frequency analysis by defining normal morlet wavelet as the transform kernel actually liu et al 2007 applied nmwt to describe the earths polar motion and proposed that there is only one instantaneous period in the observed chandler wobble su et al 2014 used ntft in long term polar motion prediction and the results showed a very good accuracy duan et al 2015 recovered the 6 year oscillation signal from interannual of length of day lod variations using nmwt in this study we apply nmwt to extract main tide constituents and predict short term tide levels in practice the closer a data time series to the current time the more useful it will be for prediction su et al 2014 however the edge effect that exist in the normal time frequency spectrum makes the transform results at the current time i e the end of the observation implausible in order to overcome the edge effect for the multi component signal and obtain the instantaneous frequency amplitude and phase at the current time the inaction method can be used repeatedly this paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a general outline of ntft and explains how the inaction method works section 3 describes the tide forecasting model based on ntft in section 4 tide gauge data from quarry bay in hong kong is used to test the performance of the inaction method for short term prediction a comparison of this method with classical harmonic analysis is also performed conclusions are reported in section 5 2 normal time frequency transform 2 1 definition for a time function f t c its time frequency transform tft is defined as 1 ψ f τ ϖ f t ψ t τ ϖ d t ϖ τ r where τ and ϖ are time and frequency indices ψ represents the transform kernel the over line denotes the conjugate operator c is the complex field and r is the real field a tft 1 is called a ntft if the transform kernel ψ τ ϖ s fourier transform 2 ψ ˆ ω ϖ ψ t ϖ exp i ω t d t satisfies 3 ψ ˆ ω ϖ 1 when ω ϖ 4 ψ ˆ ω ϖ 1 when ω ϖ where hat ˆ denotes the fourier transforms operator and refers to modulus operator ψ ω ϖ is a function of ϖ and ω as an example ψ t ϖ 1 2 π exp t 2 2 exp i ϖ t and its fourier transform ψ ˆ ω ϖ exp ω ϖ 2 2 a typical ntft kernel can be constructed as 5 ψ t ϖ μ ϖ w μ ϖ t exp i ϖ t w t ω r where ω r means the set of normal window function and μ ϖ denotes the time frequency resolution adaptor tfra which can be almost any mathematical expression or number except zero su et al 2014 for example letting μ ϖ 1 yields a phase updated gabor transform for another example letting μ ϖ ϖ yields a normal wavelet transform note that μ ϖ also can be designated in another form according to the characteristic of the signal to be analysed such as ϖ 4 ϖ arctan ϖ π and so on finally w t is called normal window function whose fourier transform satisfies the following 6 w ˆ ω w ˆ ω maximum 1 ω 0 where means if and only if eq 6 illustrates that the fourier transform of normal window function should be a maximum 1 if and only if its frequency index is equal to zero the meaning of eq 6 is equivalent to eq 3 and eq 4 2 2 inaction principle and inaction method in order to introduce the inaction method we must first introduce the inaction principle in other words we would like to show some properties of ntft that conventional tft does not hold a complex harmonic signal h t can be written as 7 h t a exp i β t a exp i β t ϕ where a is the complex amplitude β is the angular frequency ϕ is the initial phase and β t ϕ is the instantaneous phase h t is a quasi harmonic if amplitude a or frequency β change slowly over time t applying a ntft to h t holds 8 ψ h τ ϖ maximum h τ ϖ β τ r 9 ψ h τ β h τ τ r where means for any these properties as shown by eqs 8 and 9 are called the inaction principle which is the basis of the inaction method this principle means that the value of ψ τ ϖ of a harmonic h t with frequency β should gets the local maximum at any time point τ if and only if the variable ϖ is equal to β i e the harmonic frequency can be recognized by observing the maximum of ψ τ ϖ meanwhile ψ τ ϖ is exactly the harmonic itself when ϖ β i e ntft can directly extract a harmonic component with instantaneous amplitude and phase data any ntft all satisfies the inaction principle we would like to proof this principle proof 10 ψ h τ ϖ h t ψ t τ ϖ d t a exp i β t ϕ μ ϖ w μ ϖ t τ exp i ϖ t τ d t a exp i ϕ μ ϖ exp i β t w μ ϖ t τ exp i ϖ t τ d t let t τ x then t x τ a exp i ϕ μ ϖ w μ ϖ x exp i β x τ i ϖ x d x a exp i ϕ i β τ μ ϖ w μ ϖ x exp i ϖ β x d x a exp i ϕ β τ w ˆ ϖ β μ ϖ h τ w ˆ ϖ β μ ϖ considering eq 6 w ˆ ω maximum 1 if and only if ϖ β then we can conclude eq 8 and eq 9 here the proof ends a real harmonic s t a cos β t ϕ a r can also be recovered following the relation 11 2 re ψ s τ β s τ a cos β τ ϕ where re means obtain the real component eq 11 can be proven by the euler formula c o s θ 1 2 exp i θ exp i θ hence two step must be taken to recover a complex harmonic signal from its time frequency spectrum we called the first step recognition looking for the ϖ that causes ψ f τ ϖ to reach its local maximum value at any time point τ second step is called extraction where ϖ must be equal to the numerical value that we obtained in the first step then the value of ψ f τ ϖ is exactly the harmonic itself or twice the real part of ψ f τ ϖ for a real signal the quasi harmonic components also can be recovered in the same way and the numerical example in the next section will demonstrate this specifically speaking the value of ϖ that makes ψ f τ ϖ a τ fixed local maximum can be regarded as instantaneous frequency while local maximum can be regarded as the instantaneous amplitude also the value of ψ f τ ϖ at the instantaneous frequency can represents the instantaneous value of quasi harmonic at the time point τ for another time point τ the instantaneous frequency phase and amplitude can be acquired by repeating the above step this method for harmonic quasi harmonic extraction referred to as inaction method is a line pass filter method in the filtering language different from the high low pass filter which passes signals with a frequency higher lower than a certain cut off frequency or band pass that passes frequencies within a certain range and rejects frequencies outside that range line pass filter passes the signal with a certain frequency instead of a range of frequencies for multi harmonic quasi harmonic signals inaction method enables the user to extract each individual components more information can be found in liu and hsu 2012 and liu et al 2007 in this study we analysed tide signal via nmwt whose transform kernel can be constructed by letting μ ϖ ϖ and w t 1 2 π σ exp t 2 2 σ 2 following eq 5 and eq 6 the transform can be written as 12 ψ τ ϖ ϖ 2 π σ f t exp ϖ 2 t τ 2 2 σ 2 exp i ϖ t τ d t where σ represents the window width that can influence resolution in time and frequency domain it is important to choose a suitable σ to make a balance between time and frequency solution because ntft is limited by the heisenberg uncertainty principle moreover the extent of edge effect is also affected by the window width σ it always take some time to choose a suitable window width due to the fact that too large σ will increase the edge effect range while too small σ will decrease the frequency resolution however the inaction principle holds independently of the chosen window width σ of the transform kernel the difference between nmwt and conventional morlet wavelet transform cmwt are displayed in table 1 both cmwt and nmwt can recognize the local frequency by observing the maximum of convolution of a series of basis functions with different center frequencies and the signal to be analysed however the primary difference between the two transforms is that kernel ψ τ ϖ t refers to the l1 norm while kernel ψ a b t refers to the l2 norm 2 3 numerical example of inaction method in this section we will use an example to demonstrate how the inaction method works given a real signal that contains two quasi harmonic components with fixed frequencies periods of 2 4 and 4 2 units respectively and a time variable amplitude 13 h t 10 4 sin π t 20 cos 2 π t 2 4 9 2 sin π t 30 cos 2 π t 4 2 three different time frequency spectra fig 1 were obtained using nmwt to h t with different window width σ the two individual quasi harmonics can be retrieved from their sum by observing the local maximum of ψ h τ ϖ according to the inaction principle it can be seen from fig 1a that ψ h τ ϖ return the local maximum when ϖ is equal to 2 4 and 4 2 at any time point in other words the period of two quasi harmonic are recognized two horizontal black line can be draw around ϖ 2 4 and ϖ 4 2 respectively the line are called ridge line for the corresponding quasi harmonics the nmwt values along the ridge lines recover the corresponding quasi harmonics the reconstruction from fig 1a is very close to the original fig 2 though the amplitude of the signal evolves over time also the influence of window width to the time frequency spectrum can be observed a width that is too small would mix the two quasi harmonic fig 1b while a large width would reduce the time resolution and lead to long range edge effects fig 1c the reconstruction had a high level accuracy except for the beginning and end of the signal due to the edge effect the larger the window width is the longer length of edge effect nevertheless multi harmonic signals contain components whose frequencies are too close to distinguish with a small window width we applied nmwt to the residuals the different of original signal and the reconstruction signal again but with a smaller window width we found there was still something to extract this second extraction was added to the first reconstruction signal when summed together they were closer to the original signal at the beginning and end than the first extraction alone fig 3 to end this section we introduce the nftf theory and provide a new way of multi quasi harmonic recognition and extraction the inaction method the window width is used to control time and frequency resolution to overcome the edge effect of multi quasi harmonics the inaction method can be applied more than once first a suitable window width is applied to distinguish components with similar frequencies second a smaller window width is chosen to decrease the range of edge effect it is necessary to note that this method for edge effect reduction only suitable for multi harmonics or multi quasi harmonics fixed frequency but time vary amplitude by the way nmwt can serve as a satisfactory tool in non stationary signals analysis though in this study it is applied to nearly stationary signals only 3 preparation for prediction 3 1 prediction mode in classical harmonic analysis the hourly tidal level y at hour t can be simulated as 14 y t k t b n 1 n a n t cos β n t ϕ n where b means the long term mean tidal level and k is the linear trend n is the total number of tidal constituents β n and ϕ n represent the frequency and phase respectively a n t is amplitude with little variation in other words tidal constituents may be regarded as being quasi harmonic with fixed periods but varying magnitudes for a liner function the linear least squares method always provides a simple and efficient solution therefore our main attention were concentrate on the later in theory no matter how much the amplitude change even the period instantaneous information of a quasi harmonic can be obtained using the inaction method the most significant component of tidal level prediction is the knowledge of each tidal constituent s frequency instantaneous amplitude and phase which all can be determined by the inaction method tidal level prediction can be calculated in the complex domain because the real signal would be transformed to a complex domain via nmwt we select the starting point t k set the parameter m as the lead time and the prediction model can be express as 15 y t k m k t k m b 2 re n 1 n a n t k exp i β n t k ϕ n exp i β n m in this way the tidal level at next hour m can be predicted 3 2 data sources and preparation to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model hourly tidal data were collected from quarry bay in hong kong from january to 15th august 2016 the data were divided into two parts the first part january 1st to july 15th was used to extract tidal constituents while the second part july 15th to august 15th was used to compare observations with the forecasted tidal level according to the record of quarry bay the highest tidal level was 2600 m m the lowest tidal level was 170 m m and the average tide was 1400 m m the range of the tide gauge was 2200 m m all measurement data implemented in this study were download from uhslc university of hawaii sea level center http uhslc soest hawaii edu datainfo 3 3 accuracy evaluation in many other tidal level prediction studies the performance is assessed in terms of root mean square error rmse the correlation coefficient r and the scatter index si these can be written as 16 r m s e i 1 n y i x i 2 n 17 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 18 s i r m s e x where y i x i denote the observed and predicted tidal levels respectively at the ith hour n is the total number and y x represent mean values of observed and predicted tidal levels respectively in this study the last equation was modified to substitute a for x where a refers to the tidal level range 19 r r m s e r m s e a the r r m s e was selected as a standard because it is meaningless to discuss accuracy without considering the range of tide moreover tidal range a is more convincing than the average value x 4 results and discussion 4 1 tide time frequency analysis in this section hourly tidal data collected from quarry bay was analysed using the method described above before using nmwt a fourier transform was needed to determine the range of each constituent s period fig 4 three period ranges were selected for the transform for a short term prediction we don t consider periods that larger than 30 h fig 5 a illustrates the components whose periods range from 3 to 7 h fig 5b illustrates the components whose periods range from 11 to 13 h and finally fig 5c illustrates the components whose periods range from 22 to 28 h each horizontal color bar in these figures represents a tidal constituent some may contain more than one tidal constituent the major constituents of the tides include diurnal tide q 1 o 1 k 1 p 1 semi diurnal tide m 2 n 2 k 2 s 2 short period tide m 4 m s 4 2 m s 6 these can be recognized with an accuracy of 0 01 h 0 01 h was chosen as the time step to strike a balance between accuracy and calculation other value can be selected by user however from the time frequency spectra two color bars around period of 12 65 and 26 87 h represent n 2 and q 1 respectively may be a little difficult to find because of the pale color each color bar displayed in fig 5 abc recovered a tidal constituent using inaction method fig 5 def as it is expected the amplitude of semi diurnal tides m 2 the deepest color bar make up the largest proportion of tidal level it is necessary to note that the period around 12 h should have been represented by two color bars for k 2 and s 2 correspondingly however only one color bar is shown due to the fact that the periods were too close to separate a larger window would have led to a long range of edge effects the same was true for k 1 and p 1 around 24 h in fig 5c therefore the combination of k 1 and p 1 k 2 and s 2 should be considered as two quasi harmonics one can found that their amplitudes change significantly but over a long time period this is the reason why we focused only on the short term tidal level predictions the influence of the edge effect can be seen in fig 5 def in the beginning and end of time as described above a larger window width can separate these tidal constituents but will lead to a large range of edge effect therefore a smaller window width was applied again to extract information at the edges the ntft spectra of residue signal the difference between observed and reconstructed in the first pass are shown in fig 6 the color bars around the edge were extracted again and added to the extraction results from the first pass moreover some constituents with small amplitude are shown in the ntft spectrum at the second pass such as 2 n 2 around 12 88 h two more tidal constituents were extracted from the third pass finally about 14 quasi harmonics tidal constituents are extracted and used to reconstruct past and predict future tidal level table 4 the reconstruction and observations are shown in fig 7 finally the edge effects needed to be overcome in order to obtain instantaneous information to predict future tidal levels the amplitude of mixture tides k 1 and p 1 k 2 and s 2 may change over time however slowly this means that the amplitudes over two consecutive days could be the same good results can be obtained when using the information for each constituent on one day to forecast tidal levels on the following day week or month 4 2 prediction of tidal level though the tide signal can be decomposed into hundreds or thousands of harmonic components this does not imply that the more components you extract the higher prediction accuracy will be amiri simkooei et al 2014 found that the tide prediction using the 413 extracted frequencies could nearly provide identical result with those provided based on the most important constituents 50 frequencies in this study we predicted the short term tidal level based on only 14 main tidal constituents table 3 at quarry bay the reason we used so few frequencies for forecasting was because our purpose was to make short term predictions and the primary tidal constituents made the largest contribution for that a different starting point i e t k mentioned in the eq 15 would result in different prediction choosing a suitable starting point is key to a successful prediction it should satisfy the following two conditions be close to the prediction start time and have high reconstruction precision we select a starting point to be 25th of june for quarry bay although this point fell within the range of edge effect inaction method was used repeatedly to reduce it then the future tidal level was calculated following eq 15 lead times of 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 days for tidal prediction at quarry bay are shown in fig 8 and the accuracy details are summarized in table 2 it can be seen from the results that the observations and predictions were very close one can find that the correlation coefficients were very good mainly due to the unbiased instantaneous phase that was determined by the inaction method also the relative rmse was a little less than makarynskyy et al 2004 achieved using ann artificial neural network sea level forecasts in terms of the root mean square error about 10 of tidal range also it can be seen that longer lead times led to poorer prediction results this may be due to two factors first the amplitudes of the quasi harmonics for two of the tidal constituents with similar frequencies changed a lot over a long period second constituents with long periods need to be taken into account for long term prediction a matlab program t tide provided by pawlowicz et al 2002 was used to make an another prediction about 34 tide table 5 constituents parameters were calculated by this program which is based on classical harmonic analysis results are displayed in fig 9 and table 3 fig 10 compare the rmse values for inaction method and classical harmonic analysis fig 11 illustrates the correlation coefficient between the inaction method and classical harmonic analysis against the observation data the inaction method performed similarly to classical harmonic analysis for short term tidal level forecasting but was somewhat better for shorter lead times less than 15 days the classical harmonic analysis was slightly better for longer lead times at quarry bay 5 conclusion this study was the first attempt to use the inaction method to extract tidal constituents and predict short term tidal levels observations from hong kong s quarry bay were selected for research the prediction using the inaction method and classical harmonic analysis were compared these results confirmed the applicability of the tested methods for predicting short term tidal levels using only a short data series the following conclusions can be drawn short term tidal level prediction using inaction method does not need a long data observation and tidal table the ntft is able to recognize tidal constituents instantaneous frequencies amplitudes and phases and harmonic quasi harmonic components of tidal signal can be extracted using the inaction method for a short term prediction tidal constituents with similar frequencies such as k 2 and s 2 k 1 and p 1 can be regarded as one quasi harmonic however separation would be needed in order to carried out long term prediction results show that the prediction was worse as lead time increase so inaction method is only appropriate for the short term tidal level predictions based on this study further work can be done for making mid term and long term predictions there is promising potential for applying the inaction method in tidal level prediction acknowledgments we are grateful to the university of hawaii sea level center uhslc for providing the tidal level data this study is supported by

23473,this study introduces a new method named inaction method also referred to as a line pass filter in the filtering language for predicting short term tidal levels the inaction method which is based on normal time frequency transform ntft theory can recognize and extract harmonic quasi harmonic components of a tidal signal without an inverse transform conventional methods decompose tidal levels into a series of harmonic constituents and each constituent has its own fixed amplitude and frequency instead of those harmonic parameters the inaction method enables the user to directly and exactly recover the harmonic with instantaneous amplitude frequency and phase apply this method more than once can reduce edge effect and retrieve instantaneous harmonic information based on instantaneous harmonic information extracted tidal constituents then can be used to predict future tidal levels unlike harmonic analysis which always requires a long period of tidal level record to make sure an accurate prediction inaction method can use short term data in addition the conventional method require a tide table to determine frequencies while the proposed method does not tide gauge measurements from quarry bay hong kong are tested in this study results demonstrate the capacity of the inaction method to generate short term tidal level forecast based on correlation coefficient 0 92 0 99 root mean square error about 4 8 of the tidal range keywords normal time frequency transform harmonic analysis inaction method tidal level prediction short term edge effect 1 introduction due to the significance of marine ecosystems for economics today it is important to research sea level heights in the near shore environment particularly knowledge of future near shore sea level is essential for planning coastal structures harbors bay estuary engineering or biological resources management the variation in near shore sea level is mainly due to the rise and fall of the tides the most popular method for tidal level prediction has been classical harmonic analysis which was developed by kelvin improved by darwin 1892 doodson 1921 and other researchers these studies were based on the fact that tides are a periodic phenomenon that can be expressed as the superposition of several sinusoidal functions each sinusoidal function has three parameters to be determined amplitude frequency and phase many different tidal tables have been created by extracting the tide generating potential from known orbital periodicities of the earth moon sun system including those presented by doodson 1928 cartwright and tayler 1971 cartwright and edden 1973 xi and hou 1987 hartmann and wenzel 1994 hartmann and wenzel 1995 and roosbeek 1996 with these known frequencies the remaining parameters can be calculated by the least squares method continuous wavelet transform cwt a satisfactory tool for non stationary signal time frequency analysis also can be used to extract tidal information for instance jay and flinchem 1997 flinchem and jay 2000 and jay and kukulka 2003 applied cwt to analysis the river tides which vary rapidly over time erol 2011 compared wavelet analysis and least squares spectral analysis for tide gauge sensor data however all studies focused on the utility of cwt for non stationary signal analysis this study will show that cwt can be used for harmonic analysis without inverse transform by resorting to l1 norm normalization morlet wavelet transform because it is an observation based method inaction method in this study was presented to extract tidal constituents based on observation for which the frequencies amplitudes and phases are assumed to be unknown i e tidal table haven t been used this method can extract the harmonic quasi harmonic a signal having slowly varying magnitudes or slightly varying frequencies components of the signal directly via time frequency transform without the need for an inverse transform other methods such as harmonic analysis and fourier transform all obtain a series of parameters but the inaction method enables the user to extract harmonic quasi harmonic components with instantaneous amplitude frequency and phase in other words the inaction method is able to make prediction using instantaneous information while other methods cannot a normal time frequency transform ntft liu and hsu 2012 need to be constructed before apply inaction method we used a normal morlet wavelet transform nmwt a special ntft in tidal time frequency analysis by defining normal morlet wavelet as the transform kernel actually liu et al 2007 applied nmwt to describe the earths polar motion and proposed that there is only one instantaneous period in the observed chandler wobble su et al 2014 used ntft in long term polar motion prediction and the results showed a very good accuracy duan et al 2015 recovered the 6 year oscillation signal from interannual of length of day lod variations using nmwt in this study we apply nmwt to extract main tide constituents and predict short term tide levels in practice the closer a data time series to the current time the more useful it will be for prediction su et al 2014 however the edge effect that exist in the normal time frequency spectrum makes the transform results at the current time i e the end of the observation implausible in order to overcome the edge effect for the multi component signal and obtain the instantaneous frequency amplitude and phase at the current time the inaction method can be used repeatedly this paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a general outline of ntft and explains how the inaction method works section 3 describes the tide forecasting model based on ntft in section 4 tide gauge data from quarry bay in hong kong is used to test the performance of the inaction method for short term prediction a comparison of this method with classical harmonic analysis is also performed conclusions are reported in section 5 2 normal time frequency transform 2 1 definition for a time function f t c its time frequency transform tft is defined as 1 ψ f τ ϖ f t ψ t τ ϖ d t ϖ τ r where τ and ϖ are time and frequency indices ψ represents the transform kernel the over line denotes the conjugate operator c is the complex field and r is the real field a tft 1 is called a ntft if the transform kernel ψ τ ϖ s fourier transform 2 ψ ˆ ω ϖ ψ t ϖ exp i ω t d t satisfies 3 ψ ˆ ω ϖ 1 when ω ϖ 4 ψ ˆ ω ϖ 1 when ω ϖ where hat ˆ denotes the fourier transforms operator and refers to modulus operator ψ ω ϖ is a function of ϖ and ω as an example ψ t ϖ 1 2 π exp t 2 2 exp i ϖ t and its fourier transform ψ ˆ ω ϖ exp ω ϖ 2 2 a typical ntft kernel can be constructed as 5 ψ t ϖ μ ϖ w μ ϖ t exp i ϖ t w t ω r where ω r means the set of normal window function and μ ϖ denotes the time frequency resolution adaptor tfra which can be almost any mathematical expression or number except zero su et al 2014 for example letting μ ϖ 1 yields a phase updated gabor transform for another example letting μ ϖ ϖ yields a normal wavelet transform note that μ ϖ also can be designated in another form according to the characteristic of the signal to be analysed such as ϖ 4 ϖ arctan ϖ π and so on finally w t is called normal window function whose fourier transform satisfies the following 6 w ˆ ω w ˆ ω maximum 1 ω 0 where means if and only if eq 6 illustrates that the fourier transform of normal window function should be a maximum 1 if and only if its frequency index is equal to zero the meaning of eq 6 is equivalent to eq 3 and eq 4 2 2 inaction principle and inaction method in order to introduce the inaction method we must first introduce the inaction principle in other words we would like to show some properties of ntft that conventional tft does not hold a complex harmonic signal h t can be written as 7 h t a exp i β t a exp i β t ϕ where a is the complex amplitude β is the angular frequency ϕ is the initial phase and β t ϕ is the instantaneous phase h t is a quasi harmonic if amplitude a or frequency β change slowly over time t applying a ntft to h t holds 8 ψ h τ ϖ maximum h τ ϖ β τ r 9 ψ h τ β h τ τ r where means for any these properties as shown by eqs 8 and 9 are called the inaction principle which is the basis of the inaction method this principle means that the value of ψ τ ϖ of a harmonic h t with frequency β should gets the local maximum at any time point τ if and only if the variable ϖ is equal to β i e the harmonic frequency can be recognized by observing the maximum of ψ τ ϖ meanwhile ψ τ ϖ is exactly the harmonic itself when ϖ β i e ntft can directly extract a harmonic component with instantaneous amplitude and phase data any ntft all satisfies the inaction principle we would like to proof this principle proof 10 ψ h τ ϖ h t ψ t τ ϖ d t a exp i β t ϕ μ ϖ w μ ϖ t τ exp i ϖ t τ d t a exp i ϕ μ ϖ exp i β t w μ ϖ t τ exp i ϖ t τ d t let t τ x then t x τ a exp i ϕ μ ϖ w μ ϖ x exp i β x τ i ϖ x d x a exp i ϕ i β τ μ ϖ w μ ϖ x exp i ϖ β x d x a exp i ϕ β τ w ˆ ϖ β μ ϖ h τ w ˆ ϖ β μ ϖ considering eq 6 w ˆ ω maximum 1 if and only if ϖ β then we can conclude eq 8 and eq 9 here the proof ends a real harmonic s t a cos β t ϕ a r can also be recovered following the relation 11 2 re ψ s τ β s τ a cos β τ ϕ where re means obtain the real component eq 11 can be proven by the euler formula c o s θ 1 2 exp i θ exp i θ hence two step must be taken to recover a complex harmonic signal from its time frequency spectrum we called the first step recognition looking for the ϖ that causes ψ f τ ϖ to reach its local maximum value at any time point τ second step is called extraction where ϖ must be equal to the numerical value that we obtained in the first step then the value of ψ f τ ϖ is exactly the harmonic itself or twice the real part of ψ f τ ϖ for a real signal the quasi harmonic components also can be recovered in the same way and the numerical example in the next section will demonstrate this specifically speaking the value of ϖ that makes ψ f τ ϖ a τ fixed local maximum can be regarded as instantaneous frequency while local maximum can be regarded as the instantaneous amplitude also the value of ψ f τ ϖ at the instantaneous frequency can represents the instantaneous value of quasi harmonic at the time point τ for another time point τ the instantaneous frequency phase and amplitude can be acquired by repeating the above step this method for harmonic quasi harmonic extraction referred to as inaction method is a line pass filter method in the filtering language different from the high low pass filter which passes signals with a frequency higher lower than a certain cut off frequency or band pass that passes frequencies within a certain range and rejects frequencies outside that range line pass filter passes the signal with a certain frequency instead of a range of frequencies for multi harmonic quasi harmonic signals inaction method enables the user to extract each individual components more information can be found in liu and hsu 2012 and liu et al 2007 in this study we analysed tide signal via nmwt whose transform kernel can be constructed by letting μ ϖ ϖ and w t 1 2 π σ exp t 2 2 σ 2 following eq 5 and eq 6 the transform can be written as 12 ψ τ ϖ ϖ 2 π σ f t exp ϖ 2 t τ 2 2 σ 2 exp i ϖ t τ d t where σ represents the window width that can influence resolution in time and frequency domain it is important to choose a suitable σ to make a balance between time and frequency solution because ntft is limited by the heisenberg uncertainty principle moreover the extent of edge effect is also affected by the window width σ it always take some time to choose a suitable window width due to the fact that too large σ will increase the edge effect range while too small σ will decrease the frequency resolution however the inaction principle holds independently of the chosen window width σ of the transform kernel the difference between nmwt and conventional morlet wavelet transform cmwt are displayed in table 1 both cmwt and nmwt can recognize the local frequency by observing the maximum of convolution of a series of basis functions with different center frequencies and the signal to be analysed however the primary difference between the two transforms is that kernel ψ τ ϖ t refers to the l1 norm while kernel ψ a b t refers to the l2 norm 2 3 numerical example of inaction method in this section we will use an example to demonstrate how the inaction method works given a real signal that contains two quasi harmonic components with fixed frequencies periods of 2 4 and 4 2 units respectively and a time variable amplitude 13 h t 10 4 sin π t 20 cos 2 π t 2 4 9 2 sin π t 30 cos 2 π t 4 2 three different time frequency spectra fig 1 were obtained using nmwt to h t with different window width σ the two individual quasi harmonics can be retrieved from their sum by observing the local maximum of ψ h τ ϖ according to the inaction principle it can be seen from fig 1a that ψ h τ ϖ return the local maximum when ϖ is equal to 2 4 and 4 2 at any time point in other words the period of two quasi harmonic are recognized two horizontal black line can be draw around ϖ 2 4 and ϖ 4 2 respectively the line are called ridge line for the corresponding quasi harmonics the nmwt values along the ridge lines recover the corresponding quasi harmonics the reconstruction from fig 1a is very close to the original fig 2 though the amplitude of the signal evolves over time also the influence of window width to the time frequency spectrum can be observed a width that is too small would mix the two quasi harmonic fig 1b while a large width would reduce the time resolution and lead to long range edge effects fig 1c the reconstruction had a high level accuracy except for the beginning and end of the signal due to the edge effect the larger the window width is the longer length of edge effect nevertheless multi harmonic signals contain components whose frequencies are too close to distinguish with a small window width we applied nmwt to the residuals the different of original signal and the reconstruction signal again but with a smaller window width we found there was still something to extract this second extraction was added to the first reconstruction signal when summed together they were closer to the original signal at the beginning and end than the first extraction alone fig 3 to end this section we introduce the nftf theory and provide a new way of multi quasi harmonic recognition and extraction the inaction method the window width is used to control time and frequency resolution to overcome the edge effect of multi quasi harmonics the inaction method can be applied more than once first a suitable window width is applied to distinguish components with similar frequencies second a smaller window width is chosen to decrease the range of edge effect it is necessary to note that this method for edge effect reduction only suitable for multi harmonics or multi quasi harmonics fixed frequency but time vary amplitude by the way nmwt can serve as a satisfactory tool in non stationary signals analysis though in this study it is applied to nearly stationary signals only 3 preparation for prediction 3 1 prediction mode in classical harmonic analysis the hourly tidal level y at hour t can be simulated as 14 y t k t b n 1 n a n t cos β n t ϕ n where b means the long term mean tidal level and k is the linear trend n is the total number of tidal constituents β n and ϕ n represent the frequency and phase respectively a n t is amplitude with little variation in other words tidal constituents may be regarded as being quasi harmonic with fixed periods but varying magnitudes for a liner function the linear least squares method always provides a simple and efficient solution therefore our main attention were concentrate on the later in theory no matter how much the amplitude change even the period instantaneous information of a quasi harmonic can be obtained using the inaction method the most significant component of tidal level prediction is the knowledge of each tidal constituent s frequency instantaneous amplitude and phase which all can be determined by the inaction method tidal level prediction can be calculated in the complex domain because the real signal would be transformed to a complex domain via nmwt we select the starting point t k set the parameter m as the lead time and the prediction model can be express as 15 y t k m k t k m b 2 re n 1 n a n t k exp i β n t k ϕ n exp i β n m in this way the tidal level at next hour m can be predicted 3 2 data sources and preparation to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model hourly tidal data were collected from quarry bay in hong kong from january to 15th august 2016 the data were divided into two parts the first part january 1st to july 15th was used to extract tidal constituents while the second part july 15th to august 15th was used to compare observations with the forecasted tidal level according to the record of quarry bay the highest tidal level was 2600 m m the lowest tidal level was 170 m m and the average tide was 1400 m m the range of the tide gauge was 2200 m m all measurement data implemented in this study were download from uhslc university of hawaii sea level center http uhslc soest hawaii edu datainfo 3 3 accuracy evaluation in many other tidal level prediction studies the performance is assessed in terms of root mean square error rmse the correlation coefficient r and the scatter index si these can be written as 16 r m s e i 1 n y i x i 2 n 17 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 18 s i r m s e x where y i x i denote the observed and predicted tidal levels respectively at the ith hour n is the total number and y x represent mean values of observed and predicted tidal levels respectively in this study the last equation was modified to substitute a for x where a refers to the tidal level range 19 r r m s e r m s e a the r r m s e was selected as a standard because it is meaningless to discuss accuracy without considering the range of tide moreover tidal range a is more convincing than the average value x 4 results and discussion 4 1 tide time frequency analysis in this section hourly tidal data collected from quarry bay was analysed using the method described above before using nmwt a fourier transform was needed to determine the range of each constituent s period fig 4 three period ranges were selected for the transform for a short term prediction we don t consider periods that larger than 30 h fig 5 a illustrates the components whose periods range from 3 to 7 h fig 5b illustrates the components whose periods range from 11 to 13 h and finally fig 5c illustrates the components whose periods range from 22 to 28 h each horizontal color bar in these figures represents a tidal constituent some may contain more than one tidal constituent the major constituents of the tides include diurnal tide q 1 o 1 k 1 p 1 semi diurnal tide m 2 n 2 k 2 s 2 short period tide m 4 m s 4 2 m s 6 these can be recognized with an accuracy of 0 01 h 0 01 h was chosen as the time step to strike a balance between accuracy and calculation other value can be selected by user however from the time frequency spectra two color bars around period of 12 65 and 26 87 h represent n 2 and q 1 respectively may be a little difficult to find because of the pale color each color bar displayed in fig 5 abc recovered a tidal constituent using inaction method fig 5 def as it is expected the amplitude of semi diurnal tides m 2 the deepest color bar make up the largest proportion of tidal level it is necessary to note that the period around 12 h should have been represented by two color bars for k 2 and s 2 correspondingly however only one color bar is shown due to the fact that the periods were too close to separate a larger window would have led to a long range of edge effects the same was true for k 1 and p 1 around 24 h in fig 5c therefore the combination of k 1 and p 1 k 2 and s 2 should be considered as two quasi harmonics one can found that their amplitudes change significantly but over a long time period this is the reason why we focused only on the short term tidal level predictions the influence of the edge effect can be seen in fig 5 def in the beginning and end of time as described above a larger window width can separate these tidal constituents but will lead to a large range of edge effect therefore a smaller window width was applied again to extract information at the edges the ntft spectra of residue signal the difference between observed and reconstructed in the first pass are shown in fig 6 the color bars around the edge were extracted again and added to the extraction results from the first pass moreover some constituents with small amplitude are shown in the ntft spectrum at the second pass such as 2 n 2 around 12 88 h two more tidal constituents were extracted from the third pass finally about 14 quasi harmonics tidal constituents are extracted and used to reconstruct past and predict future tidal level table 4 the reconstruction and observations are shown in fig 7 finally the edge effects needed to be overcome in order to obtain instantaneous information to predict future tidal levels the amplitude of mixture tides k 1 and p 1 k 2 and s 2 may change over time however slowly this means that the amplitudes over two consecutive days could be the same good results can be obtained when using the information for each constituent on one day to forecast tidal levels on the following day week or month 4 2 prediction of tidal level though the tide signal can be decomposed into hundreds or thousands of harmonic components this does not imply that the more components you extract the higher prediction accuracy will be amiri simkooei et al 2014 found that the tide prediction using the 413 extracted frequencies could nearly provide identical result with those provided based on the most important constituents 50 frequencies in this study we predicted the short term tidal level based on only 14 main tidal constituents table 3 at quarry bay the reason we used so few frequencies for forecasting was because our purpose was to make short term predictions and the primary tidal constituents made the largest contribution for that a different starting point i e t k mentioned in the eq 15 would result in different prediction choosing a suitable starting point is key to a successful prediction it should satisfy the following two conditions be close to the prediction start time and have high reconstruction precision we select a starting point to be 25th of june for quarry bay although this point fell within the range of edge effect inaction method was used repeatedly to reduce it then the future tidal level was calculated following eq 15 lead times of 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 days for tidal prediction at quarry bay are shown in fig 8 and the accuracy details are summarized in table 2 it can be seen from the results that the observations and predictions were very close one can find that the correlation coefficients were very good mainly due to the unbiased instantaneous phase that was determined by the inaction method also the relative rmse was a little less than makarynskyy et al 2004 achieved using ann artificial neural network sea level forecasts in terms of the root mean square error about 10 of tidal range also it can be seen that longer lead times led to poorer prediction results this may be due to two factors first the amplitudes of the quasi harmonics for two of the tidal constituents with similar frequencies changed a lot over a long period second constituents with long periods need to be taken into account for long term prediction a matlab program t tide provided by pawlowicz et al 2002 was used to make an another prediction about 34 tide table 5 constituents parameters were calculated by this program which is based on classical harmonic analysis results are displayed in fig 9 and table 3 fig 10 compare the rmse values for inaction method and classical harmonic analysis fig 11 illustrates the correlation coefficient between the inaction method and classical harmonic analysis against the observation data the inaction method performed similarly to classical harmonic analysis for short term tidal level forecasting but was somewhat better for shorter lead times less than 15 days the classical harmonic analysis was slightly better for longer lead times at quarry bay 5 conclusion this study was the first attempt to use the inaction method to extract tidal constituents and predict short term tidal levels observations from hong kong s quarry bay were selected for research the prediction using the inaction method and classical harmonic analysis were compared these results confirmed the applicability of the tested methods for predicting short term tidal levels using only a short data series the following conclusions can be drawn short term tidal level prediction using inaction method does not need a long data observation and tidal table the ntft is able to recognize tidal constituents instantaneous frequencies amplitudes and phases and harmonic quasi harmonic components of tidal signal can be extracted using the inaction method for a short term prediction tidal constituents with similar frequencies such as k 2 and s 2 k 1 and p 1 can be regarded as one quasi harmonic however separation would be needed in order to carried out long term prediction results show that the prediction was worse as lead time increase so inaction method is only appropriate for the short term tidal level predictions based on this study further work can be done for making mid term and long term predictions there is promising potential for applying the inaction method in tidal level prediction acknowledgments we are grateful to the university of hawaii sea level center uhslc for providing the tidal level data this study is supported by

23474,a series of experiments has been conducted to investigate the fluid sloshing at the first mode i e half wavelength exists inside the tank for different filling levels in a rectangular tank for each filling level fluid sloshing was driven by forced tank motions in the horizontal plane with excitation amplitudes of 0 127 cm 0 254 cm 0 508 cm and 0 635 cm respectively pressure variations on the side wall of the tank and wave elevation inside the tank were measured simultaneously using four pressure sensors and a wave gauge it was found that the filling level at which the maximum sloshing amplitude occurs namely the critical filling level decreases as the excitation amplitude increases a theoretical analysis was conducted to provide a physical explanation for this trend it was also found that an increase in the damping of the system leads to a shift of the critical filling level to a higher value the pressure on the tank sidewall is found to correlate well with the response amplitude of the water level in the tank since small excitation amplitudes were used in this study keywords sloshing critical filling level excitation amplitude first mode pressure 1 introduction sloshing is a flow phenomenon that usually occurs in a partially filled tank when the excitation frequency approaches one of the natural frequencies of the fluid sloshing modes when sloshing occurs the fluid inside the tank is subjected to violent oscillation which may induce significant localized impact pressure on the tank wall it may further induce structural damages and destabilization to a vessel zhao et al 2014 under extreme conditions hence sloshing phenomenon is of practical interest in offshore oil and gas and shipping industries sloshing has been attracting lots of attentions over the past decades for rectangular tanks the natural frequencies of the internal sloshing modes can be calculated through the theoretical relation below abramson 1966 1 ω n 2 π n g l tanh π n h l where n is the mode number of the internal sloshing l is the tank length g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the filling depth of the tank specifically ω 1 denotes the fundamental frequency i e n 1 apart from the above theoretical relation experiments are also often carried out to determine the natural frequencies through free decay tests kobayashi et al 1989 pal and bhattacharyya 2010 experimentally investigated the relationship between sloshing amplitude and the excitation frequency the fundamental sloshing frequencies the first mode at different filling levels were found to be different from those calculated by the theoretical method in eq 1 with discrepancies of approximately 4 sloshing responses under large and medium excitation amplitudes have been studied extensively in the past decades for example the experimental study by ji et al 2012 on non resonant sloshing at a large amplitude the ratio between the forcing amplitude b and the tank length l b l was 0 1 and wei et al 2015 on slamming pressure inside a sloshing tank with large amplitude excitations b l 0 102 to 0 116 royon lebeaud et al 2007 conducted sloshing experiments in a square tank under a median excitation amplitude of b l 0 0125 they investigated wave crest destabilization in detail and interpreted the cross wave instability in terms of parametric instability sloshing under small excitation amplitudes has also been studied experimentally pal and bhattacharyya 2010 studied the liquid movement in a sloshing tank under five different excitation amplitudes b l 0 005 0 01 0 015 0 02 0 025 the first one is considered as small while the rest are considered as moderate following the sinusoidal variation in the external frequency it was found that the sloshing amplitude also displays a sinusoidal pattern i e the sloshing amplitude increases initially with the increase in applied frequency and decreases thereafter and again with the increase in external frequency the slosh amplitude increases apart from the excitation amplitude the filling depth of the liquid inside the tank is another major factor that influences the sloshing response low filling depths have attracted much attention verhagen and wijngaarden 1965 observed a hydraulic jump which travelled periodically back and forth inside the tank with low filling levels under a roll excitation antuono et al 2014 extended the mathematical sloshing model proposed by antuono et al 2012 for rectangular tanks under shallow water conditions to study moderate to strong wave breaking from bores to plunger under both sway and roll motions the kinematics of the flip through in sloshing in the shallow water regime was studied by lugni et al 2006 using particle image velocimetry piv in addition the features of sloshing for high filling depth such as the kinematic and dynamic behaviours after water hits the ceiling of the tank have also been studied high filling levels can lead to high impact pressure because of the occurrence of sudden flip through faltinsen and timokha 2009 abrahamsen and faltinsen 2011 conducted experiments in a tank with high filling levels to study an air pocket entrapped by a free surface wave akyıldız et al 2013 conducted a series of experiments with three different filling levels namely 25 50 and 75 in a cylindrical tank to elucidate how the filling level influences the response amplitude they concluded that the liquid sloshing becomes weaker with the increase of the filling level due to the damping effect due to the limited number of filling levels studied it was not possible to elaborate the relationship between the filling level and the sloshing wave amplitude responses the majority of the existing studies has focused on the sloshing phenomena at very low or high filling levels with interests in the local nonlinear phenomena however there is a practical interest in the relationship between the maximum sloshing motion and filling levels under small excitation amplitudes because this is closely related to safe operations of floating liquefied natural gas flng production systems in ocean environments in this study the critical filling level h cr l at which the maximum sloshing response occurs is investigated experimentally where the rectangular tank is driven horizontally with a given amplitude at the fundamental natural frequency of the internal sloshing over a range of filling levels the critical filling level for a given excitation amplitude is then quantified and the physical explanation responsible for this phenomenon is explored 2 experimental set up the experiments were conducted in the sloshing laboratory at the university of western australia fig 1 shows the experimental set up and the definition of the co ordinate system including the 6dof hexapod the 2d tank the ultrasound sensor and the wave gauge used to detect the wave surface variation the dimensions of the rectangular tank are given in fig 2 with a breadth b 100 mm a length l 1 300 mm and a height h 900 mm the aspect ratio of the tank l b 13 1 ensures that the waves are two dimensional jiang et al 1998 pistani and thiagarajan 2012 the bottom and the left side walls were made of aluminium for the convenience of fixing the pressure sensors while the rest of the tank walls were made of perspex the tank was fixed on a hexapod which is capable of generating motions in six degrees of freedom 6dof this tank has previously been used to study liquid sloshing and impact pressure pistani and thiagarajan 2012 rafiee et al 2011 a photo of the hexapod and the rectangular tank is shown in fig 1 in this study the tank was driven with a sinusoidal oscillating motion x bsin ωt along the longitudinal direction x where b is the excitation amplitude and ω is the angular frequency of oscillation which is identical to the fundamental sloshing frequency for a given filling level four excitation amplitudes i e b 0 127 cm 0 254 cm 0 508 cm and 0 635 cm or if normalised by tank length l b l 0 001 0 002 0 004 and 0 005 were tested to examine the effect of the oscillation amplitude on sloshing performance the filling levels in this study covered a large range from h l 0 069 to h l 0 554 with different combinations of the filling levels and the excitation amplitudes a total of 76 test cases were covered in this study in the experiments the wave amplitude pressure on the sidewall and the tank movement were measured simultaneously in order to eliminate the aliasing signals a low pass filter was applied before the signals pass into the data acquisition systems daqs the low pass filter is conducted with a cut off frequency of 12 5 khz based on the experience by pistani and thiagarajan 2012 different sampling rates were also tried to examine its effect on the measured wave amplitude it was found that the results did not change apparently a butterworth low pass filter with a cut off frequency of 2 5 khz in matlab was also tried when processing the test data the corresponding results are almost the same as those under the original filter cut off frequency of 12 5 khz a capacitance wave gauge was fixed 10 mm away from the sidewall four kulite pressure sensors xcl 8m 100 3 5bara each with a diameter of 2 6 mm a measurement range of 0 350 kpa and an accuracy of 0 1 pistani and thiagarajan 2012 were used to capture the pressure variation on the sidewall based on the experiences of lugni et al 2006 and lugni et al 2010 the pressure sensors are arranged in such a way that the first one is 15 mm above the still water level and the rest three are below it with an equal interval of 15 mm such a configuration is motivated by the previous studies where the maximum wave pressure acting on the wall was usually found at or above the still water level hull and muller 2002 lugni et al 2006 a sampling frequency of 5 khz was employed for all the measurement equipment as for the impact pressure in this study the excitation amplitude is too small to generate very violent wave with fast pressure variation normally occurs within 1 6s therefore 5 khz is considered to be enough for capturing all the pressure variations the tank movement was measured by an ultrasonic sensor su1 b1 0a from micro detectors prior to the experiments all sensors for pressure wave elevation and displacement measurements were calibrated properly as shown in fig 3 very good linear correlations between the measured quantities pressure distance and wave elevation and voltage were obtained which demonstrates the reliability of the measurement in this study bulian et al 2014 showed that temperature control loop had little influence on the sloshing experimental results consequently all experiments in the present paper were conducted at a normal room temperature the liquid used for all experiments was fresh water the hexapod motion is synchronised with other instruments and the daq the flow chart of the synchronization was illustrated in fig 4 the daq includes a chassis u2781a which is responsible for acquiring the signal from the measurement and a module u2351a for signal generation the two modules u2541a each with four simultaneous differential channels are responsible for receiving signals from the pressure sensors the wave gauge and the ultrasonic sensor 3 results and discussion 3 1 natural frequencies of sloshing at different filling levels the angular frequency for various sloshing modes ω n eq 1 is an important parameter for sloshing a sloshing mode means that the fluid inside a tank oscillates at a certain natural frequency for fluid inside a tank multiple natural frequencies exist for a 2d sloshing case each sloshing mode stands for the number of half wavelengths in a tank e g mode one has one half wavelength mode two has two half wavelength i e one wavelength in the tank etc all the experiments were conducted under the fundamental frequency i e ω ω n 1 with n 1 it is paramount to find the fundamental frequency accurately for different tank filling levels in this study the fundamental frequency of the system was obtained from free decay tests by performing fast fourier transform fft to the measured wave elevation and the results are compared with the theoretical predictions for this purpose the tank was filled to a certain level and was given a large and quick stroke and then stop the water inside the tank will oscillate at its first mode natural frequency by measuring the free surface elevation inside the tank using the wave gauge fast fourier transform fft can be performed the peak frequency on the spectrum is regarded as the fundamental sloshing frequency these values for different filling levels are listed in table 1 together with those calculated using eq 1 it can be seen that the agreement between the calculated natural frequencies and the measured ones is satisfactory with a relative error of less than 1 1 3 2 variation of pressure with tank displacement fig 5 shows a typical time history of the impact pressure recorded by pressure sensor no 1 together with the corresponding time histories of wave elevation and tank displacement the surface elevation of 0 mm in fig 5 b represents the still water level in the tank since sensor 1 is located slightly above the still water level the minimum measured pressure fig 5 a is zero when the sensor is exposed to air the measured pressure shows apparent periodicity over the testing period it is seen that within a typical period of tank displacement e g the period between the two blue dash lines in fig 5 the pressure variation is characterised by two pressure crests marked by c1 and c2 and one trough marked by t a close up view of the time histories of pressure wave elevation and displacement over an entire tank moving period corresponding to the duration enclosed by the two blue dash lines in fig 5 are shown in fig 6 plotted in the phase space where the phase angle ϕ of 90 corresponds to the instant when the tank is at the right most location and ϕ 270 corresponds to the instant when the tank is at the left most location it can be seen from fig 6 b that the water elevation near the left wall of the tank 25 mm from the wall remains below zero and the water pressure measured by sensor 1 is around zero as the tank moves from left to right until at about ϕ 73 3 this is because the water level at the right end of the tank is high above zero during that period of time as the tank continues its right ward movement from ϕ 73 3 both water elevation and impact pressure at the left wall start to increase the pressure at sensor 1 reaches the maximum value at ϕ 103 2 while the water elevation continues to increase until reaching the maximum at ϕ 150 2 the maximum pressure would normally be expected when the tank stops at ϕ 90 0 the slight phase difference δϕ 13 2 is believed to be due to the viscous damping induced by the tank walls and the corners the increase of water elevation for 103 2 ϕ 150 2 is due to the inertia effect of the water it is noticed that the phase difference between the maximum pressure ϕ 103 2 and the maximum water elevation ϕ 150 2 is about 45 as the tank accelerates back towards the left for 103 2 ϕ 150 2 the pressure decreases and reaches the trough at ϕ 150 2 this pressure decrease is induced in order to balance the positive inertia force in x direction acting on the water due to the left ward acceleration of the tank since the water acceleration reaches the maximum at ϕ 150 2 would have been at ϕ 135 0 if there were no phase delay the inertia on the water mass also reaches to the maximum at ϕ 150 2 this is the reason that the pressure hits a trough at ϕ 150 2 the inertia force of water starts to decrease from ϕ 150 2 and reaches zero at ϕ 192 8 this is the reason that the pressure starts to increase from ϕ 150 2 and reaches the second peak at ϕ 192 8 the sharp pressure drop observed from ϕ 192 8 to ϕ 218 1 is mainly due to the rapid water level drop during this period after that the water level drops below zero till next period 3 3 repeatability of the impact pressure and wave amplitude it is widely recognized that the sloshing pressure lacks repeatability as it is highly localized the main reason is that when the preceding breaking wave hits the wall the reflected wave interacts with the turbulence inside of the wave resulting in high nonlinear effects the air trapped in the breaking wave during the impacting process intensifies the nonlinear effects kisacik et al 2012 to examine the repeatability of the extreme impact pressure the case with a filling level h l 0 242 under an excitation amplitude of 0 762 cm and an excitation frequency of 3 865 rad s which is equal to the first mode natural frequency as shown in table 1 were repeated for 30 times and the results are analyzed through a statistical method the so called boxplot the pressure signals measured by sensor no 3 for all the 30 tests are plotted in fig 7 using a boxplot each boxplot in fig 7 contains the data in one repeat after the reading from the pressure sensor becomes stable this method has been demonstrated to be useful in analysing experimental data lacking of perfect repeatability bulian et al 2014 the enlargement at the bottom of the figure shows the definition of each of the items the upper and lower limits of the blue box indicate the third quartile q3 75 percentile data and first quartile q1 25 percentile data of the sampled data respectively the central line red is the 50 percentile the median the interquartile range iqr means the difference between the values of the third quartile q3 and the first quartile q1 the red crosses which represent the values outside the range of q1 1 5iqr and q3 1 5iqr are called the outliers the upper and lower whiskers indicate the maximum and minimum of the non outliers respectively as can be seen in fig 7 although the upper whiskers vary among different tests they fluctuate around a mean value of 3 kpa within a scattering range of 13 the outliers which are regarded as the peak pressure values can be very large for some cases for example the peak pressure measured in tests 12 14 and 19 are much larger than those observed in the rest of the tests the outliers for all tests except 12 14 and 19 are between 3 kpa and 4 kpa as a preliminary conclusion it can be seen that although the measured pressure signals show non satisfactory repeatability in the peak pressures the repeatability of the third quartile first quartile and the median for different tests is satisfactory with a deviation of less than 1 the repeatability of the wave amplitudes among the 30 tests is examined in fig 8 using the boxplot method each boxplot in fig 8 contains data in one repeat after the reading from the wave gauge becomes stable the averaged value of the upper whiskers among the 30 tests is about 573 5 cm with a standard deviation of about 3 5 it is clearly seen that the repeatability of the wave amplitude is satisfactory for the upper whiskers first and third quartile and the median although the outliers are found in tests 5 12 17 and 27 these outliers are within 3 of the upper whisker therefore the repeatability of the outliers is acceptable as well based on the results shown in figs 7 and 8 it is clear that the third quartile first quartile and the median exhibit satisfactory repeatability using the boxplot 3 4 dependence of wave amplitude on tank filling levels and excitation amplitudes sloshing responses in the tank were measured for 18 filling levels as listed in table 1 for each filling level the tank was driven under sinusoidal movement at the first mode natural frequency for 180 s to include at least 60 pressure peaks fig 9 a shows the wave amplitude for different filling levels from h l 0 069 to h l 0 554 under b l 0 001 in order to show the completeness of the results the boxplot of the wave amplitude is also included in the figure the curve connecting the boxes through the median values shows a general variation trend of wave amplitude with the filling level obviously it increases with h l initially peaking at h l 0 332 critical filling level h cr l and then decreases with h l till the highest filling level h l 0 554 covered in the experiments for the condition of b l 0 002 shown in fig 9 b it can be seen that the wave amplitude increases mildly from less than 50 mm to 200 mm as the filling level is increased from h l 0 069 to h l 0 242 followed by a sharp increase up to 400 mm when the filling level is further increased to h l 0 298 and peaks at about h l 0 312 h cr l a decreasing trend is then found afterwards fig 9 c shows the sloshing wave amplitude under b l 0 004 for filling levels from h l 0 069 to h l 0 415 for this excitation amplitude tests were conducted up to h l 0 415 above which the water jet hits the ceiling of the tank and results in some influence on the main water body it is found that the sloshing wave amplitude increases till reaching the peak at the filling level h l 0 287 followed by a descending trend apparently the wave amplitude is increased by almost 100 mm when the external excitation increases from b 0 254 cm to 0 508 cm because of the increase in the excitation energy when the excitation amplitude is increased further to 0 635 cm fig 9 d b l 0 005 the trend of the curve is very similar to that shown in fig 9 a b and c but the maximum amplitude occurs at an even lower filling level i e h l 0 263 h cr l the variation of critical filling level with the external excitation amplitude is summarised in fig 10 for all the cases tested in this study it is seen that h cr l decreases monotonically with the increase of excitation amplitude it can be expected that when the excitation amplitude approaches 0 h cr l approaches to around 0 34 which is close to the theoretical value h l 0 3374 reported by faltinsen et al 2000 the variation trends of the response amplitude with the filling level can be explained by using the concept of critical depth faltinsen et al 2000 fultz 1962 hill 2003 which is defined as the depth of water below which the sloshing response is identified as hard spring and above which as soft spring waterhouse 1994 for the hard spring behaviour the amplitude of the standing wave increases with the increase of the excitation frequency or the filling level whereas for the soft spring behaviour the wave amplitude decreases with the increase of the excitation frequency or the filling level hill 2003 studied two dimensional weakly nonlinear standing waves under small excitation amplitude by considering the effects of weak viscosity general water depth and transient wave evolution he used a multiple scales analysis to obtain an amplitude evolution equation from such an equation a critical depth of h l 0 324 was estimated for infinitesimal amplitude of tank oscillation faltinsen and timokha 2009 also studied the critical depth and found that it was around h l 0 3374 the present critical filling levels h cr l 0 332 0 312 0 287 and 0 263 for the cases with b 0 127 cm b l 0 001 b 0 254 cm b l 0 002 b 0 508 cm b l 0 004 and b 0 635 cm b l 0 005 respectively are slightly different from that 0 324 reported by hill 2003 this could be attributed to the differences between the experimental setup and the assumptions made in the theoretical analyses e g hill 2003 the analysis method suggested by hill 2003 is applicable to situations where the excitation amplitude is small and the influence of viscous damping is weak because only skin friction due to oscillatory boundary layers is considered whereas in the experiments the excitation amplitudes are finite and the damping due to tank corners and mixing at the free surface may not be negligible to further illustrate the hard spring soft spring behaviour and the influence of the excitation amplitude on the critical filling level the method proposed by hill 2003 is implemented in the present study to predict the steady state response to facilitate the discussion the method proposed by hill 2003 is briefly outlined here following the same normalization method by hill 2003 the dimensionless parameters indicated by a superscript asterisk involved in the analysis are defined as b b l ω h g l δ δ ε 2 3 g l a a ε 1 3 l ν ν ε 4 3 l 2 g l ε b l where δ f f n is a detuning parameter measuring the difference between the frequency of the external oscillation and the natural frequency of the oscillation mass in the tank ε is the ratio of external forcing amplitude to the tank length l b is the tank breath and a is the response amplitude ν is the viscosity of the fluid inside the tank hereafter the superscript asterisks are dropped out to simplify the expression in the following discussion and expressions the equation governing the steady state response of a two dimensional wave in the tank is suggested by hill 2003 as 2 m 2 a 6 2 m α δ a 4 α 2 α δ 2 a 2 β 2 0 where α is the damping coefficient and is defined as 3 α 1 n π ν ω 2 1 b 1 n π 1 2 h sinh 2 n π h in this study n is set as 1 to focus on the fundamental mode of sloshing in the tank β is the forcing coefficient which is given by 4 β 1 1 n 1 1 n π tanh n π h 3 2 m is a nonlinear interaction coefficient and is defined as 5 m ω n 2 π 2 256 sinh 4 n π h cosh 6 n π h 6 cosh 4 n π h 24 7 cosh 3 n π h for different values of δ eq 2 is solved without damping for a given water filling depth h l the results for six filling levels with three lower and three higher than the critical depth h l 0 324 obtained by hill25 are shown in fig 11 for h l 0 324 fig 11a the response wave amplitudes the branch marked by red arrows increase with the increase of the external excitation frequency this behaviour is consistent with that of a hard spring the red h l 0 20 blue h l 0 27 and black h l 0 32 dots stand for the intersections between the wave amplitudes and the vertical line δ 0 where detuning factor equals to zero i e the external excitation frequency is the same as the lowest natural frequency obviously when h l is lower than the critical depth 0 324 the wave amplitude increases with the increase of the filling level when δ 0 in fig 11b however for h l 0 324 the response wave amplitudes the branch marked by black arrows increase with the decrease of the external excitation frequency which is consistent with the behaviour of a soft spring the red h l 0 68 blue h l 0 38 and black h l 0 34 dots stand for the intersections between the wave amplitudes and the vertical line δ 0 clearly when h l is larger than the critical depth 0 324 the wave amplitude decreases with the increase of the filling level when δ 0 from the analysis above it is seen that when the filling level equals to the critical depth the wave amplitude when δ 0 will reach an infinite value if there is no damping in the system but in reality due to the effect of damping the wave amplitude will be a finite value as obtained in the present study nevertheless the above model predictions are consistent with the trends observed in our tests the variation trend of the critical filling level with the excitation amplitude is also examined through the model proposed by hill 25 and the results are shown in fig 12 in order to obtain the results shown in fig 12 a series of excitation amplitudes b is assumed first for each value of b by solving eq 2 and considering the damping effect α which depends on the excitation amplitude a series of wave amplitudes at the corresponding filling levels can be obtained the filling level for the maximum response wave amplitude is identified as the critical filling level by repeating the above process for all excitation amplitudes the corresponding critical filling levels are obtained as shown in fig 12 it can be seen that the critical filling level decreases monotonically with the excitation amplitude b l the experimental results shown in fig 9 also confirm that when the external forcing amplitude increases from 0 127 cm to 0 635 cm the h cr l decreases from 0 332 to h l 0 263 it should be noted that although the theoretical analysis predicts the variation trend successfully the magnitude of the predicted h cr l does not agree very well with the test results the calculated results in fig 12 are h cr l 0 3245 0 3236 0 3222 0 3216 when the forcing amplitudes are 0 127 cm b l 0 001 0 254 cm b l 0 002 0 508 cm b l 0 004 and 0 635 cm b l 0 005 respectively which are larger than the experimental results shown in fig 9 a possible explanation is that the nonlinear effects such as wave breaking observed in the experiment are not included in the theoretical calculation in addition the damping coefficient in eq 3 considers only the viscous boundary layer effect near the wall whereas in reality the damping effects due to energy losses at the tank corners and free surface may be more important than the viscous effect on the wall and yet these factors are not considered there if this were true an increase in the damping of the system would be equivalent to a decrease in the excitation amplitude b physically because the weight of the input energy consumed by dissipation is increased as b decreases based on the results shown in fig 12 it is expected that h cr l will increase with the increase of damping level in the system in order to confirm this trend an additional experiment was conducted where the damping in the system is deliberately increased by installing five pieces of small wooden baffles with 4 cm2 square cross section on the tank wall and tank bottom fig 13 one baffle was aligned with the filling level while another one was mounted at 50 of the filling level the other three baffles were attached to the bottom with equal intervals no baffle was added on the right hand side wall of the tank because this experiment is aimed only at confirming a trend qualitatively the experiment was conducted for b 0 508 cm and at the first natural frequency for filling levels in the range of h l 0 208 to h l 0 346 the experimental results with baffles are shown in fig 14 b an increasing trend of sloshing amplitude from 200 mm to about 370 mm as the filling level is increased from 0 208 to 0 312 is observed followed by a mild decreasing trend as the filling level increases further the maximum sloshing amplitude a 350 mm is found at h l 0 312 the critical filling level it is seen that this critical filling depth is higher and the maximum response amplitude is smaller than its counterparts h l 0 287 and a 545 mm respectively shown in fig 9 c of the case without baffles this confirms the earlier inference 3 5 pressure variation for different filling levels the pressure on the walls is important in quantifying the force experienced by the tank therefore it is important to examine the dependence of the pressure on tank filling levels fig 15 shows the pressure measured by the four pressure sensors on the sidewall for the cases with b 0 254 cm b l 0 002 and filling levels from h l 0 069 to h l 0 554 with regard to the pressure variation through the median value fig 15 indicates an overall ascending trend with a small fluctuation from h l 0 069 to h l 0 277 and a descending trend from h l 0 312 to h l 0 554 the maximum pressure for all the pressure sensors is found at about h l 0 312 which is identical to the critical filling level the variation trends of the measured pressure shown in fig 15 are very similar to that of the response amplitudes measured near the left wall fig 9b also when the location of the pressure sensor becomes lower the magnitude of the measured pressure becomes larger fig 16 shows the pressure measured by the 4 pressure sensors for b 0 508 cm b l 0 004 at filling levels from h l 0 069 to h l 0 415 all the sensors capture a similar increasing trend for h l from 0 069 to 0 277 and a decreasing trend for h l 0 312 to h l 0 415 the measured pressure peaks at h l 0 287 for all sensors which is the same as the critical filling level for b 0 508 cm fig 9c comparing the pressure responses shown in figs 15 and 16 it is found that the responding pressure for b l 0 004 is higher than that for b l 0 002 due to the increase of input energy it is noticeable that for the two different excitation amplitudes the filling levels for the maximum pressure are equal to those at which the maximum sloshing wave amplitude occurs in order to further investigate the pressure variation with the filling level boxplots of the measured pressure signals from the four sensors for four filling levels under b l 0 002 and 0 004 are compared in fig 17 pressure sensor no 4 which is at the lowest location on the sidewall appears to record the largest pressure the upper whisker and the third quartile for all pressure sensors increase monotonically with the increase of the sensor mounting depth the present result seems to be different from that reported by hull and muller29 where the maximum wave impact pressure was found to occur at the still water level the differences observed in the two sets of experiments are attributed to the differences in the experimental conditions the present experiments were conducted under small excitation amplitudes and only very minor wave breaking is detected for the cases with h l 0 277 to 0 298 whereas in the study of hull and muller29 significant wave breaking and flip through were detected it is noted that the upper limit in fig 17 f is an exception for which the upper limit of the pressure sensor no 1 is larger than that of no 2 this is most likely caused by wave breaking 4 conclusions the dependence of the maximum wave amplitude and pressure on tank filling level has been examined experimentally in a rectangular tank under four different excitation amplitudes b l 0 001 0 002 0 004 and 0 005 at the frequency of the fundamental sloshing mode the experimental data were analyzed using the boxplot method to minimise the influence of lack of repeatability on the results especially for the time series of the impact pressure the filling levels for the maximum wave amplitude i e the critical filling level h cr l were found to occur at 0 332 0 312 0 287 and 0 263 for b l 0 001 0 002 0 004 and 0 005 respectively indicating that the critical filling level decreases monotonically with the increase in the excitation amplitude it is found through a specially designed test that an increase in the damping of the system is equivalent to the effect of decreased excitation amplitude which leads to an increase in the critical filling level and a decrease in the maximum response amplitude the occurrence of the critical filling level is explained by solving the duffing like equation for critical depth which categorises the sloshing wave into two types hard spring behaviour h l h cr l and soft spring behaviour h l h cr l the theoretical analysis indicates that h cr l increases with the decrease of excitation amplitude which is consistent with the experimental results the pressure on the tank sidewall is found to correlate well with the response amplitude of water level in the tank suggesting that the sloshing pressure measured in this study is mainly caused by the hydrostatic force this is attributed to the small excitation amplitudes used in the experiments acknowledgement the first author sincerely acknowledges the financial assistance from arc itrh ih140100012 for offshore

23474,a series of experiments has been conducted to investigate the fluid sloshing at the first mode i e half wavelength exists inside the tank for different filling levels in a rectangular tank for each filling level fluid sloshing was driven by forced tank motions in the horizontal plane with excitation amplitudes of 0 127 cm 0 254 cm 0 508 cm and 0 635 cm respectively pressure variations on the side wall of the tank and wave elevation inside the tank were measured simultaneously using four pressure sensors and a wave gauge it was found that the filling level at which the maximum sloshing amplitude occurs namely the critical filling level decreases as the excitation amplitude increases a theoretical analysis was conducted to provide a physical explanation for this trend it was also found that an increase in the damping of the system leads to a shift of the critical filling level to a higher value the pressure on the tank sidewall is found to correlate well with the response amplitude of the water level in the tank since small excitation amplitudes were used in this study keywords sloshing critical filling level excitation amplitude first mode pressure 1 introduction sloshing is a flow phenomenon that usually occurs in a partially filled tank when the excitation frequency approaches one of the natural frequencies of the fluid sloshing modes when sloshing occurs the fluid inside the tank is subjected to violent oscillation which may induce significant localized impact pressure on the tank wall it may further induce structural damages and destabilization to a vessel zhao et al 2014 under extreme conditions hence sloshing phenomenon is of practical interest in offshore oil and gas and shipping industries sloshing has been attracting lots of attentions over the past decades for rectangular tanks the natural frequencies of the internal sloshing modes can be calculated through the theoretical relation below abramson 1966 1 ω n 2 π n g l tanh π n h l where n is the mode number of the internal sloshing l is the tank length g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the filling depth of the tank specifically ω 1 denotes the fundamental frequency i e n 1 apart from the above theoretical relation experiments are also often carried out to determine the natural frequencies through free decay tests kobayashi et al 1989 pal and bhattacharyya 2010 experimentally investigated the relationship between sloshing amplitude and the excitation frequency the fundamental sloshing frequencies the first mode at different filling levels were found to be different from those calculated by the theoretical method in eq 1 with discrepancies of approximately 4 sloshing responses under large and medium excitation amplitudes have been studied extensively in the past decades for example the experimental study by ji et al 2012 on non resonant sloshing at a large amplitude the ratio between the forcing amplitude b and the tank length l b l was 0 1 and wei et al 2015 on slamming pressure inside a sloshing tank with large amplitude excitations b l 0 102 to 0 116 royon lebeaud et al 2007 conducted sloshing experiments in a square tank under a median excitation amplitude of b l 0 0125 they investigated wave crest destabilization in detail and interpreted the cross wave instability in terms of parametric instability sloshing under small excitation amplitudes has also been studied experimentally pal and bhattacharyya 2010 studied the liquid movement in a sloshing tank under five different excitation amplitudes b l 0 005 0 01 0 015 0 02 0 025 the first one is considered as small while the rest are considered as moderate following the sinusoidal variation in the external frequency it was found that the sloshing amplitude also displays a sinusoidal pattern i e the sloshing amplitude increases initially with the increase in applied frequency and decreases thereafter and again with the increase in external frequency the slosh amplitude increases apart from the excitation amplitude the filling depth of the liquid inside the tank is another major factor that influences the sloshing response low filling depths have attracted much attention verhagen and wijngaarden 1965 observed a hydraulic jump which travelled periodically back and forth inside the tank with low filling levels under a roll excitation antuono et al 2014 extended the mathematical sloshing model proposed by antuono et al 2012 for rectangular tanks under shallow water conditions to study moderate to strong wave breaking from bores to plunger under both sway and roll motions the kinematics of the flip through in sloshing in the shallow water regime was studied by lugni et al 2006 using particle image velocimetry piv in addition the features of sloshing for high filling depth such as the kinematic and dynamic behaviours after water hits the ceiling of the tank have also been studied high filling levels can lead to high impact pressure because of the occurrence of sudden flip through faltinsen and timokha 2009 abrahamsen and faltinsen 2011 conducted experiments in a tank with high filling levels to study an air pocket entrapped by a free surface wave akyıldız et al 2013 conducted a series of experiments with three different filling levels namely 25 50 and 75 in a cylindrical tank to elucidate how the filling level influences the response amplitude they concluded that the liquid sloshing becomes weaker with the increase of the filling level due to the damping effect due to the limited number of filling levels studied it was not possible to elaborate the relationship between the filling level and the sloshing wave amplitude responses the majority of the existing studies has focused on the sloshing phenomena at very low or high filling levels with interests in the local nonlinear phenomena however there is a practical interest in the relationship between the maximum sloshing motion and filling levels under small excitation amplitudes because this is closely related to safe operations of floating liquefied natural gas flng production systems in ocean environments in this study the critical filling level h cr l at which the maximum sloshing response occurs is investigated experimentally where the rectangular tank is driven horizontally with a given amplitude at the fundamental natural frequency of the internal sloshing over a range of filling levels the critical filling level for a given excitation amplitude is then quantified and the physical explanation responsible for this phenomenon is explored 2 experimental set up the experiments were conducted in the sloshing laboratory at the university of western australia fig 1 shows the experimental set up and the definition of the co ordinate system including the 6dof hexapod the 2d tank the ultrasound sensor and the wave gauge used to detect the wave surface variation the dimensions of the rectangular tank are given in fig 2 with a breadth b 100 mm a length l 1 300 mm and a height h 900 mm the aspect ratio of the tank l b 13 1 ensures that the waves are two dimensional jiang et al 1998 pistani and thiagarajan 2012 the bottom and the left side walls were made of aluminium for the convenience of fixing the pressure sensors while the rest of the tank walls were made of perspex the tank was fixed on a hexapod which is capable of generating motions in six degrees of freedom 6dof this tank has previously been used to study liquid sloshing and impact pressure pistani and thiagarajan 2012 rafiee et al 2011 a photo of the hexapod and the rectangular tank is shown in fig 1 in this study the tank was driven with a sinusoidal oscillating motion x bsin ωt along the longitudinal direction x where b is the excitation amplitude and ω is the angular frequency of oscillation which is identical to the fundamental sloshing frequency for a given filling level four excitation amplitudes i e b 0 127 cm 0 254 cm 0 508 cm and 0 635 cm or if normalised by tank length l b l 0 001 0 002 0 004 and 0 005 were tested to examine the effect of the oscillation amplitude on sloshing performance the filling levels in this study covered a large range from h l 0 069 to h l 0 554 with different combinations of the filling levels and the excitation amplitudes a total of 76 test cases were covered in this study in the experiments the wave amplitude pressure on the sidewall and the tank movement were measured simultaneously in order to eliminate the aliasing signals a low pass filter was applied before the signals pass into the data acquisition systems daqs the low pass filter is conducted with a cut off frequency of 12 5 khz based on the experience by pistani and thiagarajan 2012 different sampling rates were also tried to examine its effect on the measured wave amplitude it was found that the results did not change apparently a butterworth low pass filter with a cut off frequency of 2 5 khz in matlab was also tried when processing the test data the corresponding results are almost the same as those under the original filter cut off frequency of 12 5 khz a capacitance wave gauge was fixed 10 mm away from the sidewall four kulite pressure sensors xcl 8m 100 3 5bara each with a diameter of 2 6 mm a measurement range of 0 350 kpa and an accuracy of 0 1 pistani and thiagarajan 2012 were used to capture the pressure variation on the sidewall based on the experiences of lugni et al 2006 and lugni et al 2010 the pressure sensors are arranged in such a way that the first one is 15 mm above the still water level and the rest three are below it with an equal interval of 15 mm such a configuration is motivated by the previous studies where the maximum wave pressure acting on the wall was usually found at or above the still water level hull and muller 2002 lugni et al 2006 a sampling frequency of 5 khz was employed for all the measurement equipment as for the impact pressure in this study the excitation amplitude is too small to generate very violent wave with fast pressure variation normally occurs within 1 6s therefore 5 khz is considered to be enough for capturing all the pressure variations the tank movement was measured by an ultrasonic sensor su1 b1 0a from micro detectors prior to the experiments all sensors for pressure wave elevation and displacement measurements were calibrated properly as shown in fig 3 very good linear correlations between the measured quantities pressure distance and wave elevation and voltage were obtained which demonstrates the reliability of the measurement in this study bulian et al 2014 showed that temperature control loop had little influence on the sloshing experimental results consequently all experiments in the present paper were conducted at a normal room temperature the liquid used for all experiments was fresh water the hexapod motion is synchronised with other instruments and the daq the flow chart of the synchronization was illustrated in fig 4 the daq includes a chassis u2781a which is responsible for acquiring the signal from the measurement and a module u2351a for signal generation the two modules u2541a each with four simultaneous differential channels are responsible for receiving signals from the pressure sensors the wave gauge and the ultrasonic sensor 3 results and discussion 3 1 natural frequencies of sloshing at different filling levels the angular frequency for various sloshing modes ω n eq 1 is an important parameter for sloshing a sloshing mode means that the fluid inside a tank oscillates at a certain natural frequency for fluid inside a tank multiple natural frequencies exist for a 2d sloshing case each sloshing mode stands for the number of half wavelengths in a tank e g mode one has one half wavelength mode two has two half wavelength i e one wavelength in the tank etc all the experiments were conducted under the fundamental frequency i e ω ω n 1 with n 1 it is paramount to find the fundamental frequency accurately for different tank filling levels in this study the fundamental frequency of the system was obtained from free decay tests by performing fast fourier transform fft to the measured wave elevation and the results are compared with the theoretical predictions for this purpose the tank was filled to a certain level and was given a large and quick stroke and then stop the water inside the tank will oscillate at its first mode natural frequency by measuring the free surface elevation inside the tank using the wave gauge fast fourier transform fft can be performed the peak frequency on the spectrum is regarded as the fundamental sloshing frequency these values for different filling levels are listed in table 1 together with those calculated using eq 1 it can be seen that the agreement between the calculated natural frequencies and the measured ones is satisfactory with a relative error of less than 1 1 3 2 variation of pressure with tank displacement fig 5 shows a typical time history of the impact pressure recorded by pressure sensor no 1 together with the corresponding time histories of wave elevation and tank displacement the surface elevation of 0 mm in fig 5 b represents the still water level in the tank since sensor 1 is located slightly above the still water level the minimum measured pressure fig 5 a is zero when the sensor is exposed to air the measured pressure shows apparent periodicity over the testing period it is seen that within a typical period of tank displacement e g the period between the two blue dash lines in fig 5 the pressure variation is characterised by two pressure crests marked by c1 and c2 and one trough marked by t a close up view of the time histories of pressure wave elevation and displacement over an entire tank moving period corresponding to the duration enclosed by the two blue dash lines in fig 5 are shown in fig 6 plotted in the phase space where the phase angle ϕ of 90 corresponds to the instant when the tank is at the right most location and ϕ 270 corresponds to the instant when the tank is at the left most location it can be seen from fig 6 b that the water elevation near the left wall of the tank 25 mm from the wall remains below zero and the water pressure measured by sensor 1 is around zero as the tank moves from left to right until at about ϕ 73 3 this is because the water level at the right end of the tank is high above zero during that period of time as the tank continues its right ward movement from ϕ 73 3 both water elevation and impact pressure at the left wall start to increase the pressure at sensor 1 reaches the maximum value at ϕ 103 2 while the water elevation continues to increase until reaching the maximum at ϕ 150 2 the maximum pressure would normally be expected when the tank stops at ϕ 90 0 the slight phase difference δϕ 13 2 is believed to be due to the viscous damping induced by the tank walls and the corners the increase of water elevation for 103 2 ϕ 150 2 is due to the inertia effect of the water it is noticed that the phase difference between the maximum pressure ϕ 103 2 and the maximum water elevation ϕ 150 2 is about 45 as the tank accelerates back towards the left for 103 2 ϕ 150 2 the pressure decreases and reaches the trough at ϕ 150 2 this pressure decrease is induced in order to balance the positive inertia force in x direction acting on the water due to the left ward acceleration of the tank since the water acceleration reaches the maximum at ϕ 150 2 would have been at ϕ 135 0 if there were no phase delay the inertia on the water mass also reaches to the maximum at ϕ 150 2 this is the reason that the pressure hits a trough at ϕ 150 2 the inertia force of water starts to decrease from ϕ 150 2 and reaches zero at ϕ 192 8 this is the reason that the pressure starts to increase from ϕ 150 2 and reaches the second peak at ϕ 192 8 the sharp pressure drop observed from ϕ 192 8 to ϕ 218 1 is mainly due to the rapid water level drop during this period after that the water level drops below zero till next period 3 3 repeatability of the impact pressure and wave amplitude it is widely recognized that the sloshing pressure lacks repeatability as it is highly localized the main reason is that when the preceding breaking wave hits the wall the reflected wave interacts with the turbulence inside of the wave resulting in high nonlinear effects the air trapped in the breaking wave during the impacting process intensifies the nonlinear effects kisacik et al 2012 to examine the repeatability of the extreme impact pressure the case with a filling level h l 0 242 under an excitation amplitude of 0 762 cm and an excitation frequency of 3 865 rad s which is equal to the first mode natural frequency as shown in table 1 were repeated for 30 times and the results are analyzed through a statistical method the so called boxplot the pressure signals measured by sensor no 3 for all the 30 tests are plotted in fig 7 using a boxplot each boxplot in fig 7 contains the data in one repeat after the reading from the pressure sensor becomes stable this method has been demonstrated to be useful in analysing experimental data lacking of perfect repeatability bulian et al 2014 the enlargement at the bottom of the figure shows the definition of each of the items the upper and lower limits of the blue box indicate the third quartile q3 75 percentile data and first quartile q1 25 percentile data of the sampled data respectively the central line red is the 50 percentile the median the interquartile range iqr means the difference between the values of the third quartile q3 and the first quartile q1 the red crosses which represent the values outside the range of q1 1 5iqr and q3 1 5iqr are called the outliers the upper and lower whiskers indicate the maximum and minimum of the non outliers respectively as can be seen in fig 7 although the upper whiskers vary among different tests they fluctuate around a mean value of 3 kpa within a scattering range of 13 the outliers which are regarded as the peak pressure values can be very large for some cases for example the peak pressure measured in tests 12 14 and 19 are much larger than those observed in the rest of the tests the outliers for all tests except 12 14 and 19 are between 3 kpa and 4 kpa as a preliminary conclusion it can be seen that although the measured pressure signals show non satisfactory repeatability in the peak pressures the repeatability of the third quartile first quartile and the median for different tests is satisfactory with a deviation of less than 1 the repeatability of the wave amplitudes among the 30 tests is examined in fig 8 using the boxplot method each boxplot in fig 8 contains data in one repeat after the reading from the wave gauge becomes stable the averaged value of the upper whiskers among the 30 tests is about 573 5 cm with a standard deviation of about 3 5 it is clearly seen that the repeatability of the wave amplitude is satisfactory for the upper whiskers first and third quartile and the median although the outliers are found in tests 5 12 17 and 27 these outliers are within 3 of the upper whisker therefore the repeatability of the outliers is acceptable as well based on the results shown in figs 7 and 8 it is clear that the third quartile first quartile and the median exhibit satisfactory repeatability using the boxplot 3 4 dependence of wave amplitude on tank filling levels and excitation amplitudes sloshing responses in the tank were measured for 18 filling levels as listed in table 1 for each filling level the tank was driven under sinusoidal movement at the first mode natural frequency for 180 s to include at least 60 pressure peaks fig 9 a shows the wave amplitude for different filling levels from h l 0 069 to h l 0 554 under b l 0 001 in order to show the completeness of the results the boxplot of the wave amplitude is also included in the figure the curve connecting the boxes through the median values shows a general variation trend of wave amplitude with the filling level obviously it increases with h l initially peaking at h l 0 332 critical filling level h cr l and then decreases with h l till the highest filling level h l 0 554 covered in the experiments for the condition of b l 0 002 shown in fig 9 b it can be seen that the wave amplitude increases mildly from less than 50 mm to 200 mm as the filling level is increased from h l 0 069 to h l 0 242 followed by a sharp increase up to 400 mm when the filling level is further increased to h l 0 298 and peaks at about h l 0 312 h cr l a decreasing trend is then found afterwards fig 9 c shows the sloshing wave amplitude under b l 0 004 for filling levels from h l 0 069 to h l 0 415 for this excitation amplitude tests were conducted up to h l 0 415 above which the water jet hits the ceiling of the tank and results in some influence on the main water body it is found that the sloshing wave amplitude increases till reaching the peak at the filling level h l 0 287 followed by a descending trend apparently the wave amplitude is increased by almost 100 mm when the external excitation increases from b 0 254 cm to 0 508 cm because of the increase in the excitation energy when the excitation amplitude is increased further to 0 635 cm fig 9 d b l 0 005 the trend of the curve is very similar to that shown in fig 9 a b and c but the maximum amplitude occurs at an even lower filling level i e h l 0 263 h cr l the variation of critical filling level with the external excitation amplitude is summarised in fig 10 for all the cases tested in this study it is seen that h cr l decreases monotonically with the increase of excitation amplitude it can be expected that when the excitation amplitude approaches 0 h cr l approaches to around 0 34 which is close to the theoretical value h l 0 3374 reported by faltinsen et al 2000 the variation trends of the response amplitude with the filling level can be explained by using the concept of critical depth faltinsen et al 2000 fultz 1962 hill 2003 which is defined as the depth of water below which the sloshing response is identified as hard spring and above which as soft spring waterhouse 1994 for the hard spring behaviour the amplitude of the standing wave increases with the increase of the excitation frequency or the filling level whereas for the soft spring behaviour the wave amplitude decreases with the increase of the excitation frequency or the filling level hill 2003 studied two dimensional weakly nonlinear standing waves under small excitation amplitude by considering the effects of weak viscosity general water depth and transient wave evolution he used a multiple scales analysis to obtain an amplitude evolution equation from such an equation a critical depth of h l 0 324 was estimated for infinitesimal amplitude of tank oscillation faltinsen and timokha 2009 also studied the critical depth and found that it was around h l 0 3374 the present critical filling levels h cr l 0 332 0 312 0 287 and 0 263 for the cases with b 0 127 cm b l 0 001 b 0 254 cm b l 0 002 b 0 508 cm b l 0 004 and b 0 635 cm b l 0 005 respectively are slightly different from that 0 324 reported by hill 2003 this could be attributed to the differences between the experimental setup and the assumptions made in the theoretical analyses e g hill 2003 the analysis method suggested by hill 2003 is applicable to situations where the excitation amplitude is small and the influence of viscous damping is weak because only skin friction due to oscillatory boundary layers is considered whereas in the experiments the excitation amplitudes are finite and the damping due to tank corners and mixing at the free surface may not be negligible to further illustrate the hard spring soft spring behaviour and the influence of the excitation amplitude on the critical filling level the method proposed by hill 2003 is implemented in the present study to predict the steady state response to facilitate the discussion the method proposed by hill 2003 is briefly outlined here following the same normalization method by hill 2003 the dimensionless parameters indicated by a superscript asterisk involved in the analysis are defined as b b l ω h g l δ δ ε 2 3 g l a a ε 1 3 l ν ν ε 4 3 l 2 g l ε b l where δ f f n is a detuning parameter measuring the difference between the frequency of the external oscillation and the natural frequency of the oscillation mass in the tank ε is the ratio of external forcing amplitude to the tank length l b is the tank breath and a is the response amplitude ν is the viscosity of the fluid inside the tank hereafter the superscript asterisks are dropped out to simplify the expression in the following discussion and expressions the equation governing the steady state response of a two dimensional wave in the tank is suggested by hill 2003 as 2 m 2 a 6 2 m α δ a 4 α 2 α δ 2 a 2 β 2 0 where α is the damping coefficient and is defined as 3 α 1 n π ν ω 2 1 b 1 n π 1 2 h sinh 2 n π h in this study n is set as 1 to focus on the fundamental mode of sloshing in the tank β is the forcing coefficient which is given by 4 β 1 1 n 1 1 n π tanh n π h 3 2 m is a nonlinear interaction coefficient and is defined as 5 m ω n 2 π 2 256 sinh 4 n π h cosh 6 n π h 6 cosh 4 n π h 24 7 cosh 3 n π h for different values of δ eq 2 is solved without damping for a given water filling depth h l the results for six filling levels with three lower and three higher than the critical depth h l 0 324 obtained by hill25 are shown in fig 11 for h l 0 324 fig 11a the response wave amplitudes the branch marked by red arrows increase with the increase of the external excitation frequency this behaviour is consistent with that of a hard spring the red h l 0 20 blue h l 0 27 and black h l 0 32 dots stand for the intersections between the wave amplitudes and the vertical line δ 0 where detuning factor equals to zero i e the external excitation frequency is the same as the lowest natural frequency obviously when h l is lower than the critical depth 0 324 the wave amplitude increases with the increase of the filling level when δ 0 in fig 11b however for h l 0 324 the response wave amplitudes the branch marked by black arrows increase with the decrease of the external excitation frequency which is consistent with the behaviour of a soft spring the red h l 0 68 blue h l 0 38 and black h l 0 34 dots stand for the intersections between the wave amplitudes and the vertical line δ 0 clearly when h l is larger than the critical depth 0 324 the wave amplitude decreases with the increase of the filling level when δ 0 from the analysis above it is seen that when the filling level equals to the critical depth the wave amplitude when δ 0 will reach an infinite value if there is no damping in the system but in reality due to the effect of damping the wave amplitude will be a finite value as obtained in the present study nevertheless the above model predictions are consistent with the trends observed in our tests the variation trend of the critical filling level with the excitation amplitude is also examined through the model proposed by hill 25 and the results are shown in fig 12 in order to obtain the results shown in fig 12 a series of excitation amplitudes b is assumed first for each value of b by solving eq 2 and considering the damping effect α which depends on the excitation amplitude a series of wave amplitudes at the corresponding filling levels can be obtained the filling level for the maximum response wave amplitude is identified as the critical filling level by repeating the above process for all excitation amplitudes the corresponding critical filling levels are obtained as shown in fig 12 it can be seen that the critical filling level decreases monotonically with the excitation amplitude b l the experimental results shown in fig 9 also confirm that when the external forcing amplitude increases from 0 127 cm to 0 635 cm the h cr l decreases from 0 332 to h l 0 263 it should be noted that although the theoretical analysis predicts the variation trend successfully the magnitude of the predicted h cr l does not agree very well with the test results the calculated results in fig 12 are h cr l 0 3245 0 3236 0 3222 0 3216 when the forcing amplitudes are 0 127 cm b l 0 001 0 254 cm b l 0 002 0 508 cm b l 0 004 and 0 635 cm b l 0 005 respectively which are larger than the experimental results shown in fig 9 a possible explanation is that the nonlinear effects such as wave breaking observed in the experiment are not included in the theoretical calculation in addition the damping coefficient in eq 3 considers only the viscous boundary layer effect near the wall whereas in reality the damping effects due to energy losses at the tank corners and free surface may be more important than the viscous effect on the wall and yet these factors are not considered there if this were true an increase in the damping of the system would be equivalent to a decrease in the excitation amplitude b physically because the weight of the input energy consumed by dissipation is increased as b decreases based on the results shown in fig 12 it is expected that h cr l will increase with the increase of damping level in the system in order to confirm this trend an additional experiment was conducted where the damping in the system is deliberately increased by installing five pieces of small wooden baffles with 4 cm2 square cross section on the tank wall and tank bottom fig 13 one baffle was aligned with the filling level while another one was mounted at 50 of the filling level the other three baffles were attached to the bottom with equal intervals no baffle was added on the right hand side wall of the tank because this experiment is aimed only at confirming a trend qualitatively the experiment was conducted for b 0 508 cm and at the first natural frequency for filling levels in the range of h l 0 208 to h l 0 346 the experimental results with baffles are shown in fig 14 b an increasing trend of sloshing amplitude from 200 mm to about 370 mm as the filling level is increased from 0 208 to 0 312 is observed followed by a mild decreasing trend as the filling level increases further the maximum sloshing amplitude a 350 mm is found at h l 0 312 the critical filling level it is seen that this critical filling depth is higher and the maximum response amplitude is smaller than its counterparts h l 0 287 and a 545 mm respectively shown in fig 9 c of the case without baffles this confirms the earlier inference 3 5 pressure variation for different filling levels the pressure on the walls is important in quantifying the force experienced by the tank therefore it is important to examine the dependence of the pressure on tank filling levels fig 15 shows the pressure measured by the four pressure sensors on the sidewall for the cases with b 0 254 cm b l 0 002 and filling levels from h l 0 069 to h l 0 554 with regard to the pressure variation through the median value fig 15 indicates an overall ascending trend with a small fluctuation from h l 0 069 to h l 0 277 and a descending trend from h l 0 312 to h l 0 554 the maximum pressure for all the pressure sensors is found at about h l 0 312 which is identical to the critical filling level the variation trends of the measured pressure shown in fig 15 are very similar to that of the response amplitudes measured near the left wall fig 9b also when the location of the pressure sensor becomes lower the magnitude of the measured pressure becomes larger fig 16 shows the pressure measured by the 4 pressure sensors for b 0 508 cm b l 0 004 at filling levels from h l 0 069 to h l 0 415 all the sensors capture a similar increasing trend for h l from 0 069 to 0 277 and a decreasing trend for h l 0 312 to h l 0 415 the measured pressure peaks at h l 0 287 for all sensors which is the same as the critical filling level for b 0 508 cm fig 9c comparing the pressure responses shown in figs 15 and 16 it is found that the responding pressure for b l 0 004 is higher than that for b l 0 002 due to the increase of input energy it is noticeable that for the two different excitation amplitudes the filling levels for the maximum pressure are equal to those at which the maximum sloshing wave amplitude occurs in order to further investigate the pressure variation with the filling level boxplots of the measured pressure signals from the four sensors for four filling levels under b l 0 002 and 0 004 are compared in fig 17 pressure sensor no 4 which is at the lowest location on the sidewall appears to record the largest pressure the upper whisker and the third quartile for all pressure sensors increase monotonically with the increase of the sensor mounting depth the present result seems to be different from that reported by hull and muller29 where the maximum wave impact pressure was found to occur at the still water level the differences observed in the two sets of experiments are attributed to the differences in the experimental conditions the present experiments were conducted under small excitation amplitudes and only very minor wave breaking is detected for the cases with h l 0 277 to 0 298 whereas in the study of hull and muller29 significant wave breaking and flip through were detected it is noted that the upper limit in fig 17 f is an exception for which the upper limit of the pressure sensor no 1 is larger than that of no 2 this is most likely caused by wave breaking 4 conclusions the dependence of the maximum wave amplitude and pressure on tank filling level has been examined experimentally in a rectangular tank under four different excitation amplitudes b l 0 001 0 002 0 004 and 0 005 at the frequency of the fundamental sloshing mode the experimental data were analyzed using the boxplot method to minimise the influence of lack of repeatability on the results especially for the time series of the impact pressure the filling levels for the maximum wave amplitude i e the critical filling level h cr l were found to occur at 0 332 0 312 0 287 and 0 263 for b l 0 001 0 002 0 004 and 0 005 respectively indicating that the critical filling level decreases monotonically with the increase in the excitation amplitude it is found through a specially designed test that an increase in the damping of the system is equivalent to the effect of decreased excitation amplitude which leads to an increase in the critical filling level and a decrease in the maximum response amplitude the occurrence of the critical filling level is explained by solving the duffing like equation for critical depth which categorises the sloshing wave into two types hard spring behaviour h l h cr l and soft spring behaviour h l h cr l the theoretical analysis indicates that h cr l increases with the decrease of excitation amplitude which is consistent with the experimental results the pressure on the tank sidewall is found to correlate well with the response amplitude of water level in the tank suggesting that the sloshing pressure measured in this study is mainly caused by the hydrostatic force this is attributed to the small excitation amplitudes used in the experiments acknowledgement the first author sincerely acknowledges the financial assistance from arc itrh ih140100012 for offshore
