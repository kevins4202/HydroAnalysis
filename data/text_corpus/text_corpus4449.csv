22245,results of the large eddy simulations les over two partially superhydrophobic 3d geometries including the backward facing step and the sphere at the reynolds number of 400 1000 2000 have been presented using the open source openfoam c libraries the effect of imposing the locally partial slip on the surface of the mentioned cases has been investigated the results confirmed that the superhydrophobicity decreases the drag coefficient and increases the strouhal number of the sphere by up to 46 and 25 respectively in the meantime the superhydrophobic backward facing step experiences an increment of almost 4 and 3 in both the reattachment length placement and the recirculation length respectively in addition the results have been analyzed to improve the model s efficacy by locating the region on the geometry s surface with a dominant role on the resulting vicissitudes of the drag coefficient the strouhal number and the reattachment length to obtain such an optimum model the shear stress distribution diagram on the surface of the geometries have been studied it is found that the areas with utmost changes in the shear stress were half of the sphere that faces the flow and the side of the step that the flow reattaches to it keywords superhydrophobicity janus surface backward facing step sphere turbulence 1 introduction reattachment of flows occurs in many engineering cases this phenomenon causes the boundary layer to separate from the surface to which it was attached before and upon reattachment a recirculation region will emerge among many geometries with such behavior as diffusers and combustor the most popular one is the backward facing step le et al 1997 study of flow past submerged basilar geometries have proven to be of great significance since such disquisitions can contribute to better understanding the behavior of flow in more sophisticated and realistic applications whether they are engaged with the moving boundaries ghazanfarian et al 2016 or the heat transfer ghazanfarian and taghilou 2018 such a practice can also elevate our knowledge of paramount exceptional cases such as the work of du et al 2017 who investigated different methods of maintaining air bubble on a surface to preserve its superhydrophobic characteristics the superhydrophobicity is long bonded to drag reduction in several situations and geometries the flow past a superhydrophobic cylinder equivalent to a cylinder with sanded teflon coating was numerically investigated using the les method zeinali et al 2018 at reynolds numbers ranging from 830 to 4160 the reported data expressed a reduction of the drag force and an increase of the strouhal number as a result of the superhydrophobicity imposition zeinali et al concluded that the janus concept is capable of reducing the drag coefficient and increasing the strouhal number by approximately 20 after a thorough investigation of numerous cases they pointed out that only a fraction of the surface of the cylinder contributes to the changes mentioned above and imposing such boundary condition on only 50 of the surface yields similar results in comparison to those for the whole surface being superhydrophobic a series of experiments proved that at the reynolds numbers above 24 the vortex rings appear in the flow wake taneda 1956 up to the reynolds number of 210 the wake remains axisymmetric and steady and above that this axisymmetric structure will be lost due to the appearance of fluctuating lift force that will increase substantially as the reynolds number increases margarvey and bishop 1961 wu and faeth 1993 while the planar symmetry still exists the vortices began shedding periodically at re 300 sakamoto and haniu 1990 at higher reynolds numbers the vortex loops start to shed in a non planar symmetrical pattern tomboulides et al 1993 sakamoto and haniu 1990 chomaz et al 1993 and kim and durbin 1988 found out that the reynolds number of 800 is another critical point in flow past the sphere at this stage two dominant modes of unsteadiness exist in the wake behind the sphere that influence the measurement of the strouhal number and that is why two different strouhal numbers low mode and high mode appear an important parameter in studying flow past bluff bodies is the strouhal number numerous studies have investigated the effect of different variables on the strouhal number an example would be the study of bouzari and ghazanfarian 2017 who studied the impact of radial fins on unsteady convective heat transfer and the strouhal number they reported that as the number of fins increases from 0 to 6 the strouhal number decreases to the point that the strouhal number of the cylinder with six fins is 28 less than that of a cylinder with only one fin there are also studies ghazanfarian and nobari 2009 that have investigated the effect of rotation of cylinder on the strouhal number they have also reported that rotation will also decrease the strouhal number another critical parameter in external flows is the drag coefficient pan et al 2018 numerically investigated the influence of imposed stream wise magnetic field of different degrees on the drag coefficient the wake structure and the transition of the flow at the reynolds numbers less than 300 their results suggest that up to a specific lorentz force the recirculation length decreases while the separation angle increases for larger lorentz forces an opposite trend has been observed they also found that there is a linear dependence between c d and the root of the lorentz force ghazanfarian et al 2015 conducted a numerical study on a rotating cylinder and found out that such rotation causes the drag reduction that is in line with the findings of nobari and ghazanfarian 2009 who simulated flow past a rotating and oscillating cylinder and stated that although the drag coefficient decreases by increasing the dimensionless angular velocity up to 2 25 the amount of this drag suppression decreases by increasing the amplitude of oscillations the effect of hydrophobicity on water entry of solid objects has been experimentally investigated by korkmaz and gazel 2017 they used simple geometries including cylinder and sphere and determined that the strain on the surface upon entering the water is reduced in hydrophobic cases and the pressure is distributed more evenly which resulted to a 3 and 40 increment in the penetration and splash velocity of the sphere model for the drop height of 50 cm respectively choi et al 2006 experimentally investigated the impact of dimples on the surface of the sphere on drag coefficient reduction at high reynolds numbers since these dimples cause the local flow separation they contribute to the shear layer instability and the production of significant turbulence intensity choi et al reported that the amount of drag reduction would be almost 50 zhou et al 2015 experimentally investigated the effect of groove and dimples on the flow past a circular cylinder and reported a drag reduction of 18 to 29 in dimpled cylinder and 10 to 30 reduction in ridged cylinders another way to suppress the drag force is by placing splitters upstream of the flow amiraslanpour et al amiraslanpoura et al 2017 investigated the effect of various splitter placement layout on the drag suppression of an oscillating cylinder they pointed out that the maximum drag reduction occurs for the lock on condition at the dimensionless oscillation frequency of 1 1 flow past steps is a famous case in fluid dynamics one of the most comprehensive experiments concerning steps has been conducted by armaly et al 1983 who examined how the reattachment length is affected by the reynolds number in a span of 70 8000 they also conducted numerical investigations ikohagi and shin 1991 gartling 1990 and kim and moin 1985 all used different computer codes to simulate flow over a two dimensional backward facing step up to the reynolds number of 1200 williams and baker 1997 also simulated flow up to the reynolds number of 1200 but in a three dimensional computational domain and their work is in excellent accordance with the experiments of armaly et al 1983 meri and wengle 2002 focused on differences between the spatial discretization order the fourth order hermitian and the second order central schemes of the numerical simulations including both the dns and the les on a case involving the backward facing steps at the reynolds number of 3300 they found that using a fourth order discretization technique in their les simulations would yield more accurate results but is not as precise as those of the dns terekhov and terekhov 2017 studied the effect of suction and injection on the reattachment length at the reynolds number of 5000 and 50000 they reported that the normalized injection velocity of 0 02 would move the reattachment length further downstream by almost 10 while the normalized suction velocity of 0 02 decreases this value by 30 the drag suppression has been sought for various applications this phenomenon can be achieved in multiple ways for instance the rotation of the body namely cylinder nobari and ghazanfarian 2010 imposition of electromagnetic fields on the surface jiang et al 2019 making the surface superhydrophobic or other methods that are wholly reviewed by rashidi et al 2016 the superhydrophobicity is an exciting characteristic of surfaces first discovered by high water repellency of lotus leaves barthlott and neinhui 1997 among many applications this phenomenon can reduce the drag coefficient ou et al 2004 demonstrate the self cleaning properties george et al 2016 and has an anti corrosion effect das et al 2018 that can increase the lifespan of the products in the maritime industry medical science is another field where the superhydrophobicity has growing application faldea et al 2016 superhydrophobicity is of diverse interest for a variety of medical applications that include the local drug diffusion control reduction of infections and bacterial adhesion on newly implanted body organ etc efremov et al 2013 ou et al 2004 investigated the effect of ultra hydrophobicity on the pressure drop of the flow in microchannels they conducted a series of experiments to find out the impact of micropost size and their spacing on the pressure drop of the flow and reported that as the spacing of the microposts increases from 15 μm to 150 μm the amount of pressure drop decreases by about 30 ou et al 2004 stated that the efficiency of these surfaces increases by increasing the spacing of the posts george et al 2016 created a superhydrophobic surface by replicating laser written nanoscale hierarchical structures on pmma they concluded that the wettability and the contact angle of a water droplet on such fabricated surface is only a function of the laser fluence daniello et al 2009 studied the turbulent flow over two types of micro patterned superhydrophobic surfaces by the piv technique and the direct pressure measurements they found that the slip velocities and the drag reduction increase with increasing the reynolds number and the slip velocities and the drag reduction tends to grow more rapidly with increasing the feature spacing they also noticed through experiments that the viscous sublayer is a limiting factor in choosing the micro ridges spacing deducting that if the micro ridges spacing is higher than the viscous sublayer the reduction of the drag coefficient stops in the present paper the effects of superhydrophobicity on the drag coefficient and the strouhal number of the three dimensional sphere and its impact on the reattachment length and the recirculation region of flow over a two dimensional backward facing step have been investigated furthermore the sections of these geometries that contribute the most to such alterations are identified these findings will enable us to extend such trends to predict results on other internal or external geometries the first step is to numerically model the slip coefficient which is done by validating the numerical results of flow past the three dimensional benchmark case by experiments presented by daniello et al 2013 the details of computing such engineering model are presented in ref zeinali et al 2018 the result of zeinali et al 2018 suggests that for the shf value of 0 425 the corresponding experimental results daniello et al 2013 can be achieved based on the numerically found slip coefficient other essential parameters such as the drag coefficient and the strouhal number of the sphere and the reattachment length and recirculation region of the backward facing step are computed for validation of the numerical results of flow past a three dimensional sphere the data presented by tomboulides et al 1993 margarvey and bishop 1961 kim and durbin 1988 and achenbach 1974 and for flow over the backward facing step the experimental results of armaly et al 1983 have been used the procedure for producing superhydrophobic material is a challenging exercise zeinali et al 2018 due to high manufacturing costs and the complexities of manufacturing the superhydrophobic surfaces it is crucial to identify the most effective segments of the mentioned geometries for this purpose the skin friction coefficient is calculated along the surface of both sphere and backward facing step in the framework of the janus concept the sections along the sphere and the backward facing step surface with the highest contribution to the total drag force reduction and reattachment length relocation have been identified the main focus of the present study is to examine the effect of superhydrophobicity on the flow past sphere and over a backward facing step the superhydrophobicity boundary condition that equalizes the sanded teflon surface has been numerically modeled and used throughout this work by analyzing the shear stress diagram and the janus concept the fraction of these geometries surface that play the key role on the observed changes are spotted such study results in a more effective and optimal usage of the superhydrophobicity which will in turn reduce the expenditure of using this new technology the present paper is organized as follows sec 2 presents the details of geometry and boundary conditions and the numerical structure of the solution in the openfoam codes sec 3 describes the implementation of the engineering model for the superhydrophobic surfaces sec 4 presents the computational results and finally sec 5 concludes the paper 2 mathematical formulation and numerical models the governing equations for the continuity and momentum conservation law in their non dimensional form are as follows 1 u i x i 0 u i t x j u i u j p x i 2 r e s i j x j τ i j r x j where p u x ν s i j and t denote filtered variable filtered pressure field filtered velocity derivation with respect to x the kinematic viscosity the rate of strain tensor and time respectively τ i j r is the residual subgrid scale sgs stress tensor which represents the motion of fluid at scales smaller than the filter width to obtain the closure the sgs model of one equation eddy viscosity model is used in the present paper legendre et al 2009 the eddy viscosity is calculated from the value of the sgs turbulent kinetic energy k s g s derived from the following equation 2 k s g s t u i k s g s x i p ε x i 2 r e t k s g s x i where 3 p 2 ν t s i j s i j ε c ε k s g s 3 2 l l δ x δ y δ z 1 3 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i r e t u l ν t ν t c k k s g s 0 5 l where u and l are the characteristic velocity and length respectively the details of one equation les model can be found in ref legendre et al 2009 in order to model the superhydrophobic condition over walls a third type mixed robin boundary condition has been introduced and implemented into the openfoam codes equation 1 has been solved with respect to the superhydrophobic boundary condition 4 u s l i p 1 β u y w a l l 0 where u s l i p is the fluid s relative velocity at wall β the superhydrophobicity factor shf is an adjustable coefficient which has been computed based on the curve fitting process to the experimental data presented by daniello et al 2013 zeinali et al 2018 the dimensionless parameters are the reynolds number r e ρ u d μ 1 and the shf β coefficient it is found that this coefficient does not depend on the flow regime the reynolds number or the shear stress of the wall the current study has numerically modeled the boundary condition that replicates the sanded teflon superhydrophobic surface which the related data have been experimentally produced by daniello et al 2013 and the extracted model has been used throughout the present work the overall view of the computational domain and the geometrical details of the flow over the sphere are depicted in fig 1 to be sure about the reliability of this model the mesh independence studies have been conducted using different grid sizes at the reynolds number of 400 the model has also been verified by the time step size independence study at the same reynolds number the results of the grid study and the time step independence tests have been presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively it should be noted that the courant number is kept under unity and the inlet boundary condition for the studied cases involve a developed velocity profile with turbulence inlet boundary condition which would simulate turbulence at the entrance with the scale of 0 05 of the mean flow although it should be mentioned that the flow over step has been investigated in pseudo 3d case all simulations in openfoam are conducted using 3d meshes with a specific thickness in the third dimension details of the geometry of planar flow inside a channel containing a backward facing step have been given in fig 2 the mesh and the time step independence studies have been accomplished at the reynolds number of 300 and the results are available in table 3 and table 4 respectively in these tables the lengths have been non dimensionalized using the height of the step the velocity slip boundary condition has been integrated into the open source openfoam c libraries the pisofoam solver has been chosen as the basic solver openfoam user s guide 2018 the piso algorithm pressure implicit with splitting of operators is found to be suitable for solving the pressure velocity coupling the number of iterations for the pressure equation and the momentum corrector in each step is set to 2 the tolerance of convergence is 1 10 7 the pisofoam algorithm is relatively fast but it comes at the expense of it being very sensitive to the time step size so for the stability issues the courant number is kept less than 1 throughout the simulations 3 numerical validation and verification 3 1 case 1 flow over cylinder value of the superhydrophobicity factor shf as a function of the reynolds number has been calculated based on the data presented by daniello et al 2013 and the details are presented in zeinali et al 2018 which suggest that the most compatible results with the experimental data can be obtained using the shf value equal to 0 425 the same superhydrophobicity constant and boundary condition will be applied to the surfaces of the sphere and the backward facing step fig 3 shows the details of the computation of the shf factor using the data corresponding to the case of a three dimensional cylinder with superhydrophobic surfaces 3 2 case 2 flow over sphere table 5 presents the strouhal number and the drag coefficient calculated from the present les simulation of flow over the sphere in comparison with the existing experimental results margarvey and bishop 1961 tomboulides et al 1993 kim and durbin 1988 achenbach 1974 using the computational domain with details described in table 1 at the reynolds number of re 400 the comparison shows an agreement between the current predictions and the experimental results with the mean relative error less than 5 and 3 for the drag coefficient and the strouhal number respectively 3 3 case 3 flow over step fig 4 shows the geometrical details and symbols defined to measure the reattachment length and the recirculation region for flow over a backward facing step which has been previously experimentally studied by armaly et al 1983 these lengths have been non dimensionalized by the height of the step which is shown in fig 4 table 6 lists the results of the les simulation for the mentioned geometry which have been compared with the existing experimental results of armaly et al 1983 at the reynolds numbers of re 300 600 1200 the comparison proves an agreement between the current predictions and the experimental results with an average relative error of approximately 6 4 results and discussions case i sphere as the flow past the sphere with the no slip condition has been validated using the experimental data the results of flow over a superhydrophobic sphere with the shf factor of β 0 425 will be presented in this section first the adequacy of the grid resolution near the wall should be assessed as a fact for the boundary layer created along a flat plate the first grid point should be inside the viscous sub layer based on the wall scale this condition is satisfied as long as y 5 where y is defined as y u τ y ν where u τ y and ν are the friction velocity the wall normal distance and the fluid kinematic viscosity respectively for flow around the sphere with a curved surface a conservative approach is to have the first grid point at y 1 to ensure that the near wall grid resolution is fine enough to capture the wall shear stress correctly the plots of the mean value of y as a function of the reynolds number over the surfaces of the no slip and the superhydrophobic spheres with coarse fine and finest meshes are reported in fig 5 as it is obvious from the figure the value of y has been conservatively kept less than 0 3 for all cases as mentioned earlier the experimental data sakamoto and haniu 1990 kim and durbin 1988 achenbach 1974 have shown two different modes in the strouhal number spectrum of the sphere for the reynolds numbers higher than 800 this high mode exists up to the reynolds number of 10 4 moller 1938 while at higher reynolds numbers only the low mode strouhal number can be seen taneda 1975 fig 6 shows the spectral analysis of the lift coefficient of the sphere at the reynolds number of 2000 fig 6 displays the variation of the power density versus the dimensionless frequency or the strouhal number of flow past the sphere with the no slip and the superhydrophobic conditions the spectrum is obtained by taking the fast fourier transformation of the time history of the lift coefficient and it is an indicator of the dominant vortex shedding frequencies in the wake of the sphere comparison of the dominant frequencies of the no slip and the superhydrophobic spheres concludes that the normalized vortex shedding frequency of the superhydrophobic surface experiences a growth of about 22 and 10 for the first and the second peaks respectively so the superhydrophobicity not only increases the frequency of the periodic flow over the sphere but also weakens the value of the peaks in the spectrum since the drag coefficient is closely related to the variation of the shear stress along the wall and the angle of separation point at which the shear stress becomes zero the variation of shear stress along the surface of the sphere is studied in this section fig 7 illustrates the distribution of the mean dimensionless shear stress versus the dimensionless distance between the border of the superhydrophobic section and the center of sphere at various reynolds numbers in the range 400 2000 three cases of the smooth sphere the superhydrophobic sphere and the partially superhydrophobic sphere with the janus angle of 90 measured from the upstream stagnation point at the reynolds number of 400 1000 2000 are considered the janus degree can easily be computed using the data presented in fig 7 it is found that in all cases the superhydrophobicity reduces the magnitude of the local shear stress on the surface results show that the maximum normalized shear stress has been reduced from 0 38 1 55 3 6 to 0 34 1 4 3 2 by increasing the reynolds number comparison of totally and partially superhydrophobic spheres implies that imposing the superhydrophobicity behind the sphere has a minor effect on the distribution of the shear stress along the entire body so it can be expected that using the superhydrophobic materials behind the sphere where the shear stress is near zero is not beneficial another point in fig 7 is the influence of superhydrophobicity on the location of the separation point comparison of the data obtained from the smooth and the superhydrophobic cases depicts that the superhydrophobicity shifts the point of separation towards the upstream in all cases the magnitude of the shift varies between 18 at the reynolds number of 400 to almost 2 at the reynolds number equal to 2000 so it can be concluded that increasing the reynolds number weakens the effect of the superhydrophobicity on the position of the separation point in order to better understand the mechanism of the shear stress reduction it shall be understood that due to the lower surface free energy of the coating or the trapped air between the ridges on the superhydrophobic surface the lower friction and thus the slip velocity appears increase of the slip velocity on the surface is then responsible for the reduction of the slope of the velocity profile or the velocity gradient and the shear stress on the wall here the partially superhydrophobic case with the janus angle of 90 is considered as fig 7 suggested the major changes in the mean dimensionless shear stress occur between angles 0 90 so we use a new term called the partial superhydrophobicity which means that only half of the sphere s surface 0 to 90 measured from the leading edge is superhydrophobic this kind of semi optimization method was first presented by zeinali et al 2018 and as they suggested this can be tested for other complex and multi dimensional geometries fig 8 a presents the effects of the reynolds number on flow past the superhydrophobic the partially superhydrophobic and the smooth sphere it is evident from this figure that the superhydrophobicity decreases the drag coefficient by 25 at the reynolds number of 400 to 46 at r e 2000 the amount of the drag coefficient reduction and the difference between the partially and the totally superhydrophobic cases increases with the reynolds number the strouhal number variation with respect to the reynolds number is presented in fig 8b at the reynolds numbers above 800 the strouhal number diagram is divided into two branches the high mode and the low mode sakamoto and haniu 1990 chomaz et al 1993 kim and durbin 1988 while in this figure the strouhal number of reynolds 1000 yields only one of them both of these modes high mode and low mode are captures at re 2000 the strouhal number for partially and totally superhydrophobic cases are almost the same at reynolds 400 1000 and the low mode strouhal number at reynolds number 2000 but this overlap does not exist in high mode strouhal number at re 2000 the strouhal number at re 400 remains almost the same as the smooth case while at the reynolds number of 1000 and 2000 the strouhal number increases by about 25 the experimental results are also included in fig 8 for the drag coefficient the experiments of roos and willmarth 1971 and regarding the strouhal number the results of sakamoto and haniu 1990 and kim and durbin 1988 have been used in addition to further validation of results it is obvious from this figure that imposing the superhydrophobicity to half and all of the sphere s surface approximately yields the same result which again emphasizes the noteworthiness of the janus concept the mean dimensionless velocity slip distribution over the surface of the sphere is presented in fig 9 abscissa of the curve corresponds to the smooth non superhydrophobic slipless sphere the slip velocity shown in the figure has been normalized using the free stream velocity it is found that for all three cases the maximum slip velocity takes place around x r 0 4 and its value changes from 0 12 to 0 25 at the reynolds number of 400 2000 respectively as expected after the separation point regardless of the reynolds number the slip velocity is nearly zero which confirms the necessity of using the partial superhydrophobicity on the surface in order to demonstrate the origin of drag suppression based on the janus concept the pressure contours and distribution of the pressure coefficient over the surface of smooth and the partially superhydrophobic sphere with the janus angle of 90 at the reynolds number of 2000 are shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively the fluctuations in pressure coefficient are due to the fact that the diagram depicts 0 to 180 but it represents both sides of the sphere and these fluctuations are because of the difference between the two sides if inspected closely the difference between the leading edge and the trailing edge pressure coefficients left column of the smooth sphere fig 10 is more than that of the partially superhydrophobic sphere fig 11 which in turn can result in drag coefficient reduction these figures show the variation of the pressure coefficient and the pressure contour during one cycle of vortex shedding the right column of fig 12 compares the vorticity contours of in the wake of the sphere at the reynolds number of 2000 during a vortex shedding cycle while the left column displays the instantaneous iso surface of the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor at the same reynolds number the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor q criterion u ˆ i x j is defined as q u ˆ i x j u ˆ j x i the q criterion contours shown in fig 12 correspond to q 100 cases a c e g are for smooth sphere and sub figures b d f h are for a partially superhydrophobic sphere with the janus angle of 90 the normalized times are a b t 10 85 10 4 that corresponds to the beginning of the cycle c d t 11 3 10 4 corresponds to π 2 phase of shedding e f t 11 75 10 4 corresponds to π phase of shedding and g h t 12 2 10 4 corresponds to 3 π 2 phase of shedding comparison of these figures shows that by imposing the superhydrophobicity condition on walls of the sphere the width and the length of the wake behind the sphere become narrower and more prolonged respectively also in the regions of positive q the vorticity is significant so the iso surface of q is an identifier of the coherent vortices in the flow structure lesieur et al 2005 fig 12 shows that the flow structure is three dimensional and has strong longitudinal vortices spread between the big kelvin helmholtz billows it also demonstrates that the superhydrophobicity wall condition does not alter the presence of the 3d coherent structures case ii backward facing step in order to investigate the impact of superhydrophobicity on the reattachment length and the recirculation region walls of the step have been divided into five sections which were named a1 to a5 as shown in fig 4 at first the superhydrophobicity has been imposed to all sections and then in order to identify the most influential section each of 5 sections was given the same boundary condition individually and the results have been reported in tab 7 the shear stress on a4 and a5 is zero and therefore they are not crucial components for superhydrophobicity imposition although the shear stress is not zero on a1 and a2 they also have an insignificant impact on the reported changes it is obvious from the data presented in table 7 that imposing superhydrophobicity on a1 a2 a4 a5 results in data that is equal to that of the no slip condition it is the a3 element which is the most influential section and thus imposing the superhydrophobicity on only a3 will present results equal to that of the whole geometry a1 to a5 having complete superhydrophobic wall condition the mean dimensionless shear stress on the walls of the backward facing step is studied thoroughly and fig 13 shows the distribution of this variable at the reynolds number of 300 600 1200 it is evident from this figure that the changes in mean dimensionless shear stress are maximum on the a3 element the shear stress is zero on a4 and a5 and therefore they have no impact on the reattachment length and the recirculation area although the changes in the shear stress are non zero on a1 and a2 their impact on such changes is still negligible and thus the section which plays the most influential role on these changes is the a3 element the oscillations near the corner of the step seen in fig 13 are because of the instantaneous creation shedding and interference of the vortex rings with the up downstream flows also the change of patch at x s 40 before and after the step may create sudden changes in flow pattern and hence in the shear stress from fig 13a c it is clear that the most significant amount of change of shear stress on a3 element takes place between 40 82 and 51 now the a3 element shall be split into two sections 40 82 51 superhydrophobic and 51 81 64 smooth the results are presented in table 8 the results suggest that the impact of only one fourth of the a3 element is equal to 95 of the impact of a complete superhydrophobic backward facing step in which all elements are superhydrophobic influence of imposing the slip velocity on a1 and a3 surfaces has also been investigated this slip velocity is normalized by the inlet velocity it can be seen in fig 14 that by increasing the reynolds number the dimensionless slip velocity also increases the slip velocity at a1 increase from 0 02 at re 400 to 0 09 at re 2000 while the average values in a3 are 0 01 0 02 and 0 05 at reynolds number 300 600 and 1200 respectively this means that the effect of superhydrophobicity on the slip velocity increases by the reynolds number it is clear that the minimum point in fig 14b where the velocity reaches zero belongs to the location of reattachment length streamlines of flow in inside a backward facing channel are shown in fig 15 at re 300 600 1200 for both smooth and superhydrophobic cases it is obvious that by increasing the fluid s inlet velocity and consequently the reynolds number more stretched and powerful recirculation region will be formed imposing the superhydrophobicity on the walls of the backward facing step also increases the length of the recirculation region which will diminish by increasing the reynolds number fig 16 compares the vorticity and the q criterion contours of the smooth and the superhydrophobic step it is obvious from these figures that the superhydrophobic wall condition will enlarge the width of the recirculation region by almost 10 analysis of these figures also reveals that the superhydrophobicity also moves the reattachment length further downstream by about 8 5 conclusions the effects of superhydrophobicity on flow characteristics over the three dimensional sphere and the two dimensional backward facing step is investigated numerically using the large eddy simulation method after validating the computational simulation results the correlation for the boundary condition is implemented using a new third type robin boundary condition it is found that the superhydrophobicity in the case of the sphere will result in a reduction of the drag coefficient and an augmentation of the strouhal number and in the backward facing step case moves the reattachment length further downstream and increases the length strength of the recirculation zone furthermore the concept of janus surface is also implemented in both cases to identify the dominant segments in the mentioned changes the numerical results including the surface shear stress and the velocity slip over the wall have shown that imposing the superhydrophobic wall condition on almost half of the sphere surface and three fourths of the backward facing step will have little effect on drag reduction and augmentation of the reattachment length that is while the remaining 50 and 25 sections reduce the drag coefficient and increase the reattachment length almost identical to the whole surfaces being superhydrophobic 
22245,results of the large eddy simulations les over two partially superhydrophobic 3d geometries including the backward facing step and the sphere at the reynolds number of 400 1000 2000 have been presented using the open source openfoam c libraries the effect of imposing the locally partial slip on the surface of the mentioned cases has been investigated the results confirmed that the superhydrophobicity decreases the drag coefficient and increases the strouhal number of the sphere by up to 46 and 25 respectively in the meantime the superhydrophobic backward facing step experiences an increment of almost 4 and 3 in both the reattachment length placement and the recirculation length respectively in addition the results have been analyzed to improve the model s efficacy by locating the region on the geometry s surface with a dominant role on the resulting vicissitudes of the drag coefficient the strouhal number and the reattachment length to obtain such an optimum model the shear stress distribution diagram on the surface of the geometries have been studied it is found that the areas with utmost changes in the shear stress were half of the sphere that faces the flow and the side of the step that the flow reattaches to it keywords superhydrophobicity janus surface backward facing step sphere turbulence 1 introduction reattachment of flows occurs in many engineering cases this phenomenon causes the boundary layer to separate from the surface to which it was attached before and upon reattachment a recirculation region will emerge among many geometries with such behavior as diffusers and combustor the most popular one is the backward facing step le et al 1997 study of flow past submerged basilar geometries have proven to be of great significance since such disquisitions can contribute to better understanding the behavior of flow in more sophisticated and realistic applications whether they are engaged with the moving boundaries ghazanfarian et al 2016 or the heat transfer ghazanfarian and taghilou 2018 such a practice can also elevate our knowledge of paramount exceptional cases such as the work of du et al 2017 who investigated different methods of maintaining air bubble on a surface to preserve its superhydrophobic characteristics the superhydrophobicity is long bonded to drag reduction in several situations and geometries the flow past a superhydrophobic cylinder equivalent to a cylinder with sanded teflon coating was numerically investigated using the les method zeinali et al 2018 at reynolds numbers ranging from 830 to 4160 the reported data expressed a reduction of the drag force and an increase of the strouhal number as a result of the superhydrophobicity imposition zeinali et al concluded that the janus concept is capable of reducing the drag coefficient and increasing the strouhal number by approximately 20 after a thorough investigation of numerous cases they pointed out that only a fraction of the surface of the cylinder contributes to the changes mentioned above and imposing such boundary condition on only 50 of the surface yields similar results in comparison to those for the whole surface being superhydrophobic a series of experiments proved that at the reynolds numbers above 24 the vortex rings appear in the flow wake taneda 1956 up to the reynolds number of 210 the wake remains axisymmetric and steady and above that this axisymmetric structure will be lost due to the appearance of fluctuating lift force that will increase substantially as the reynolds number increases margarvey and bishop 1961 wu and faeth 1993 while the planar symmetry still exists the vortices began shedding periodically at re 300 sakamoto and haniu 1990 at higher reynolds numbers the vortex loops start to shed in a non planar symmetrical pattern tomboulides et al 1993 sakamoto and haniu 1990 chomaz et al 1993 and kim and durbin 1988 found out that the reynolds number of 800 is another critical point in flow past the sphere at this stage two dominant modes of unsteadiness exist in the wake behind the sphere that influence the measurement of the strouhal number and that is why two different strouhal numbers low mode and high mode appear an important parameter in studying flow past bluff bodies is the strouhal number numerous studies have investigated the effect of different variables on the strouhal number an example would be the study of bouzari and ghazanfarian 2017 who studied the impact of radial fins on unsteady convective heat transfer and the strouhal number they reported that as the number of fins increases from 0 to 6 the strouhal number decreases to the point that the strouhal number of the cylinder with six fins is 28 less than that of a cylinder with only one fin there are also studies ghazanfarian and nobari 2009 that have investigated the effect of rotation of cylinder on the strouhal number they have also reported that rotation will also decrease the strouhal number another critical parameter in external flows is the drag coefficient pan et al 2018 numerically investigated the influence of imposed stream wise magnetic field of different degrees on the drag coefficient the wake structure and the transition of the flow at the reynolds numbers less than 300 their results suggest that up to a specific lorentz force the recirculation length decreases while the separation angle increases for larger lorentz forces an opposite trend has been observed they also found that there is a linear dependence between c d and the root of the lorentz force ghazanfarian et al 2015 conducted a numerical study on a rotating cylinder and found out that such rotation causes the drag reduction that is in line with the findings of nobari and ghazanfarian 2009 who simulated flow past a rotating and oscillating cylinder and stated that although the drag coefficient decreases by increasing the dimensionless angular velocity up to 2 25 the amount of this drag suppression decreases by increasing the amplitude of oscillations the effect of hydrophobicity on water entry of solid objects has been experimentally investigated by korkmaz and gazel 2017 they used simple geometries including cylinder and sphere and determined that the strain on the surface upon entering the water is reduced in hydrophobic cases and the pressure is distributed more evenly which resulted to a 3 and 40 increment in the penetration and splash velocity of the sphere model for the drop height of 50 cm respectively choi et al 2006 experimentally investigated the impact of dimples on the surface of the sphere on drag coefficient reduction at high reynolds numbers since these dimples cause the local flow separation they contribute to the shear layer instability and the production of significant turbulence intensity choi et al reported that the amount of drag reduction would be almost 50 zhou et al 2015 experimentally investigated the effect of groove and dimples on the flow past a circular cylinder and reported a drag reduction of 18 to 29 in dimpled cylinder and 10 to 30 reduction in ridged cylinders another way to suppress the drag force is by placing splitters upstream of the flow amiraslanpour et al amiraslanpoura et al 2017 investigated the effect of various splitter placement layout on the drag suppression of an oscillating cylinder they pointed out that the maximum drag reduction occurs for the lock on condition at the dimensionless oscillation frequency of 1 1 flow past steps is a famous case in fluid dynamics one of the most comprehensive experiments concerning steps has been conducted by armaly et al 1983 who examined how the reattachment length is affected by the reynolds number in a span of 70 8000 they also conducted numerical investigations ikohagi and shin 1991 gartling 1990 and kim and moin 1985 all used different computer codes to simulate flow over a two dimensional backward facing step up to the reynolds number of 1200 williams and baker 1997 also simulated flow up to the reynolds number of 1200 but in a three dimensional computational domain and their work is in excellent accordance with the experiments of armaly et al 1983 meri and wengle 2002 focused on differences between the spatial discretization order the fourth order hermitian and the second order central schemes of the numerical simulations including both the dns and the les on a case involving the backward facing steps at the reynolds number of 3300 they found that using a fourth order discretization technique in their les simulations would yield more accurate results but is not as precise as those of the dns terekhov and terekhov 2017 studied the effect of suction and injection on the reattachment length at the reynolds number of 5000 and 50000 they reported that the normalized injection velocity of 0 02 would move the reattachment length further downstream by almost 10 while the normalized suction velocity of 0 02 decreases this value by 30 the drag suppression has been sought for various applications this phenomenon can be achieved in multiple ways for instance the rotation of the body namely cylinder nobari and ghazanfarian 2010 imposition of electromagnetic fields on the surface jiang et al 2019 making the surface superhydrophobic or other methods that are wholly reviewed by rashidi et al 2016 the superhydrophobicity is an exciting characteristic of surfaces first discovered by high water repellency of lotus leaves barthlott and neinhui 1997 among many applications this phenomenon can reduce the drag coefficient ou et al 2004 demonstrate the self cleaning properties george et al 2016 and has an anti corrosion effect das et al 2018 that can increase the lifespan of the products in the maritime industry medical science is another field where the superhydrophobicity has growing application faldea et al 2016 superhydrophobicity is of diverse interest for a variety of medical applications that include the local drug diffusion control reduction of infections and bacterial adhesion on newly implanted body organ etc efremov et al 2013 ou et al 2004 investigated the effect of ultra hydrophobicity on the pressure drop of the flow in microchannels they conducted a series of experiments to find out the impact of micropost size and their spacing on the pressure drop of the flow and reported that as the spacing of the microposts increases from 15 μm to 150 μm the amount of pressure drop decreases by about 30 ou et al 2004 stated that the efficiency of these surfaces increases by increasing the spacing of the posts george et al 2016 created a superhydrophobic surface by replicating laser written nanoscale hierarchical structures on pmma they concluded that the wettability and the contact angle of a water droplet on such fabricated surface is only a function of the laser fluence daniello et al 2009 studied the turbulent flow over two types of micro patterned superhydrophobic surfaces by the piv technique and the direct pressure measurements they found that the slip velocities and the drag reduction increase with increasing the reynolds number and the slip velocities and the drag reduction tends to grow more rapidly with increasing the feature spacing they also noticed through experiments that the viscous sublayer is a limiting factor in choosing the micro ridges spacing deducting that if the micro ridges spacing is higher than the viscous sublayer the reduction of the drag coefficient stops in the present paper the effects of superhydrophobicity on the drag coefficient and the strouhal number of the three dimensional sphere and its impact on the reattachment length and the recirculation region of flow over a two dimensional backward facing step have been investigated furthermore the sections of these geometries that contribute the most to such alterations are identified these findings will enable us to extend such trends to predict results on other internal or external geometries the first step is to numerically model the slip coefficient which is done by validating the numerical results of flow past the three dimensional benchmark case by experiments presented by daniello et al 2013 the details of computing such engineering model are presented in ref zeinali et al 2018 the result of zeinali et al 2018 suggests that for the shf value of 0 425 the corresponding experimental results daniello et al 2013 can be achieved based on the numerically found slip coefficient other essential parameters such as the drag coefficient and the strouhal number of the sphere and the reattachment length and recirculation region of the backward facing step are computed for validation of the numerical results of flow past a three dimensional sphere the data presented by tomboulides et al 1993 margarvey and bishop 1961 kim and durbin 1988 and achenbach 1974 and for flow over the backward facing step the experimental results of armaly et al 1983 have been used the procedure for producing superhydrophobic material is a challenging exercise zeinali et al 2018 due to high manufacturing costs and the complexities of manufacturing the superhydrophobic surfaces it is crucial to identify the most effective segments of the mentioned geometries for this purpose the skin friction coefficient is calculated along the surface of both sphere and backward facing step in the framework of the janus concept the sections along the sphere and the backward facing step surface with the highest contribution to the total drag force reduction and reattachment length relocation have been identified the main focus of the present study is to examine the effect of superhydrophobicity on the flow past sphere and over a backward facing step the superhydrophobicity boundary condition that equalizes the sanded teflon surface has been numerically modeled and used throughout this work by analyzing the shear stress diagram and the janus concept the fraction of these geometries surface that play the key role on the observed changes are spotted such study results in a more effective and optimal usage of the superhydrophobicity which will in turn reduce the expenditure of using this new technology the present paper is organized as follows sec 2 presents the details of geometry and boundary conditions and the numerical structure of the solution in the openfoam codes sec 3 describes the implementation of the engineering model for the superhydrophobic surfaces sec 4 presents the computational results and finally sec 5 concludes the paper 2 mathematical formulation and numerical models the governing equations for the continuity and momentum conservation law in their non dimensional form are as follows 1 u i x i 0 u i t x j u i u j p x i 2 r e s i j x j τ i j r x j where p u x ν s i j and t denote filtered variable filtered pressure field filtered velocity derivation with respect to x the kinematic viscosity the rate of strain tensor and time respectively τ i j r is the residual subgrid scale sgs stress tensor which represents the motion of fluid at scales smaller than the filter width to obtain the closure the sgs model of one equation eddy viscosity model is used in the present paper legendre et al 2009 the eddy viscosity is calculated from the value of the sgs turbulent kinetic energy k s g s derived from the following equation 2 k s g s t u i k s g s x i p ε x i 2 r e t k s g s x i where 3 p 2 ν t s i j s i j ε c ε k s g s 3 2 l l δ x δ y δ z 1 3 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i r e t u l ν t ν t c k k s g s 0 5 l where u and l are the characteristic velocity and length respectively the details of one equation les model can be found in ref legendre et al 2009 in order to model the superhydrophobic condition over walls a third type mixed robin boundary condition has been introduced and implemented into the openfoam codes equation 1 has been solved with respect to the superhydrophobic boundary condition 4 u s l i p 1 β u y w a l l 0 where u s l i p is the fluid s relative velocity at wall β the superhydrophobicity factor shf is an adjustable coefficient which has been computed based on the curve fitting process to the experimental data presented by daniello et al 2013 zeinali et al 2018 the dimensionless parameters are the reynolds number r e ρ u d μ 1 and the shf β coefficient it is found that this coefficient does not depend on the flow regime the reynolds number or the shear stress of the wall the current study has numerically modeled the boundary condition that replicates the sanded teflon superhydrophobic surface which the related data have been experimentally produced by daniello et al 2013 and the extracted model has been used throughout the present work the overall view of the computational domain and the geometrical details of the flow over the sphere are depicted in fig 1 to be sure about the reliability of this model the mesh independence studies have been conducted using different grid sizes at the reynolds number of 400 the model has also been verified by the time step size independence study at the same reynolds number the results of the grid study and the time step independence tests have been presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively it should be noted that the courant number is kept under unity and the inlet boundary condition for the studied cases involve a developed velocity profile with turbulence inlet boundary condition which would simulate turbulence at the entrance with the scale of 0 05 of the mean flow although it should be mentioned that the flow over step has been investigated in pseudo 3d case all simulations in openfoam are conducted using 3d meshes with a specific thickness in the third dimension details of the geometry of planar flow inside a channel containing a backward facing step have been given in fig 2 the mesh and the time step independence studies have been accomplished at the reynolds number of 300 and the results are available in table 3 and table 4 respectively in these tables the lengths have been non dimensionalized using the height of the step the velocity slip boundary condition has been integrated into the open source openfoam c libraries the pisofoam solver has been chosen as the basic solver openfoam user s guide 2018 the piso algorithm pressure implicit with splitting of operators is found to be suitable for solving the pressure velocity coupling the number of iterations for the pressure equation and the momentum corrector in each step is set to 2 the tolerance of convergence is 1 10 7 the pisofoam algorithm is relatively fast but it comes at the expense of it being very sensitive to the time step size so for the stability issues the courant number is kept less than 1 throughout the simulations 3 numerical validation and verification 3 1 case 1 flow over cylinder value of the superhydrophobicity factor shf as a function of the reynolds number has been calculated based on the data presented by daniello et al 2013 and the details are presented in zeinali et al 2018 which suggest that the most compatible results with the experimental data can be obtained using the shf value equal to 0 425 the same superhydrophobicity constant and boundary condition will be applied to the surfaces of the sphere and the backward facing step fig 3 shows the details of the computation of the shf factor using the data corresponding to the case of a three dimensional cylinder with superhydrophobic surfaces 3 2 case 2 flow over sphere table 5 presents the strouhal number and the drag coefficient calculated from the present les simulation of flow over the sphere in comparison with the existing experimental results margarvey and bishop 1961 tomboulides et al 1993 kim and durbin 1988 achenbach 1974 using the computational domain with details described in table 1 at the reynolds number of re 400 the comparison shows an agreement between the current predictions and the experimental results with the mean relative error less than 5 and 3 for the drag coefficient and the strouhal number respectively 3 3 case 3 flow over step fig 4 shows the geometrical details and symbols defined to measure the reattachment length and the recirculation region for flow over a backward facing step which has been previously experimentally studied by armaly et al 1983 these lengths have been non dimensionalized by the height of the step which is shown in fig 4 table 6 lists the results of the les simulation for the mentioned geometry which have been compared with the existing experimental results of armaly et al 1983 at the reynolds numbers of re 300 600 1200 the comparison proves an agreement between the current predictions and the experimental results with an average relative error of approximately 6 4 results and discussions case i sphere as the flow past the sphere with the no slip condition has been validated using the experimental data the results of flow over a superhydrophobic sphere with the shf factor of β 0 425 will be presented in this section first the adequacy of the grid resolution near the wall should be assessed as a fact for the boundary layer created along a flat plate the first grid point should be inside the viscous sub layer based on the wall scale this condition is satisfied as long as y 5 where y is defined as y u τ y ν where u τ y and ν are the friction velocity the wall normal distance and the fluid kinematic viscosity respectively for flow around the sphere with a curved surface a conservative approach is to have the first grid point at y 1 to ensure that the near wall grid resolution is fine enough to capture the wall shear stress correctly the plots of the mean value of y as a function of the reynolds number over the surfaces of the no slip and the superhydrophobic spheres with coarse fine and finest meshes are reported in fig 5 as it is obvious from the figure the value of y has been conservatively kept less than 0 3 for all cases as mentioned earlier the experimental data sakamoto and haniu 1990 kim and durbin 1988 achenbach 1974 have shown two different modes in the strouhal number spectrum of the sphere for the reynolds numbers higher than 800 this high mode exists up to the reynolds number of 10 4 moller 1938 while at higher reynolds numbers only the low mode strouhal number can be seen taneda 1975 fig 6 shows the spectral analysis of the lift coefficient of the sphere at the reynolds number of 2000 fig 6 displays the variation of the power density versus the dimensionless frequency or the strouhal number of flow past the sphere with the no slip and the superhydrophobic conditions the spectrum is obtained by taking the fast fourier transformation of the time history of the lift coefficient and it is an indicator of the dominant vortex shedding frequencies in the wake of the sphere comparison of the dominant frequencies of the no slip and the superhydrophobic spheres concludes that the normalized vortex shedding frequency of the superhydrophobic surface experiences a growth of about 22 and 10 for the first and the second peaks respectively so the superhydrophobicity not only increases the frequency of the periodic flow over the sphere but also weakens the value of the peaks in the spectrum since the drag coefficient is closely related to the variation of the shear stress along the wall and the angle of separation point at which the shear stress becomes zero the variation of shear stress along the surface of the sphere is studied in this section fig 7 illustrates the distribution of the mean dimensionless shear stress versus the dimensionless distance between the border of the superhydrophobic section and the center of sphere at various reynolds numbers in the range 400 2000 three cases of the smooth sphere the superhydrophobic sphere and the partially superhydrophobic sphere with the janus angle of 90 measured from the upstream stagnation point at the reynolds number of 400 1000 2000 are considered the janus degree can easily be computed using the data presented in fig 7 it is found that in all cases the superhydrophobicity reduces the magnitude of the local shear stress on the surface results show that the maximum normalized shear stress has been reduced from 0 38 1 55 3 6 to 0 34 1 4 3 2 by increasing the reynolds number comparison of totally and partially superhydrophobic spheres implies that imposing the superhydrophobicity behind the sphere has a minor effect on the distribution of the shear stress along the entire body so it can be expected that using the superhydrophobic materials behind the sphere where the shear stress is near zero is not beneficial another point in fig 7 is the influence of superhydrophobicity on the location of the separation point comparison of the data obtained from the smooth and the superhydrophobic cases depicts that the superhydrophobicity shifts the point of separation towards the upstream in all cases the magnitude of the shift varies between 18 at the reynolds number of 400 to almost 2 at the reynolds number equal to 2000 so it can be concluded that increasing the reynolds number weakens the effect of the superhydrophobicity on the position of the separation point in order to better understand the mechanism of the shear stress reduction it shall be understood that due to the lower surface free energy of the coating or the trapped air between the ridges on the superhydrophobic surface the lower friction and thus the slip velocity appears increase of the slip velocity on the surface is then responsible for the reduction of the slope of the velocity profile or the velocity gradient and the shear stress on the wall here the partially superhydrophobic case with the janus angle of 90 is considered as fig 7 suggested the major changes in the mean dimensionless shear stress occur between angles 0 90 so we use a new term called the partial superhydrophobicity which means that only half of the sphere s surface 0 to 90 measured from the leading edge is superhydrophobic this kind of semi optimization method was first presented by zeinali et al 2018 and as they suggested this can be tested for other complex and multi dimensional geometries fig 8 a presents the effects of the reynolds number on flow past the superhydrophobic the partially superhydrophobic and the smooth sphere it is evident from this figure that the superhydrophobicity decreases the drag coefficient by 25 at the reynolds number of 400 to 46 at r e 2000 the amount of the drag coefficient reduction and the difference between the partially and the totally superhydrophobic cases increases with the reynolds number the strouhal number variation with respect to the reynolds number is presented in fig 8b at the reynolds numbers above 800 the strouhal number diagram is divided into two branches the high mode and the low mode sakamoto and haniu 1990 chomaz et al 1993 kim and durbin 1988 while in this figure the strouhal number of reynolds 1000 yields only one of them both of these modes high mode and low mode are captures at re 2000 the strouhal number for partially and totally superhydrophobic cases are almost the same at reynolds 400 1000 and the low mode strouhal number at reynolds number 2000 but this overlap does not exist in high mode strouhal number at re 2000 the strouhal number at re 400 remains almost the same as the smooth case while at the reynolds number of 1000 and 2000 the strouhal number increases by about 25 the experimental results are also included in fig 8 for the drag coefficient the experiments of roos and willmarth 1971 and regarding the strouhal number the results of sakamoto and haniu 1990 and kim and durbin 1988 have been used in addition to further validation of results it is obvious from this figure that imposing the superhydrophobicity to half and all of the sphere s surface approximately yields the same result which again emphasizes the noteworthiness of the janus concept the mean dimensionless velocity slip distribution over the surface of the sphere is presented in fig 9 abscissa of the curve corresponds to the smooth non superhydrophobic slipless sphere the slip velocity shown in the figure has been normalized using the free stream velocity it is found that for all three cases the maximum slip velocity takes place around x r 0 4 and its value changes from 0 12 to 0 25 at the reynolds number of 400 2000 respectively as expected after the separation point regardless of the reynolds number the slip velocity is nearly zero which confirms the necessity of using the partial superhydrophobicity on the surface in order to demonstrate the origin of drag suppression based on the janus concept the pressure contours and distribution of the pressure coefficient over the surface of smooth and the partially superhydrophobic sphere with the janus angle of 90 at the reynolds number of 2000 are shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively the fluctuations in pressure coefficient are due to the fact that the diagram depicts 0 to 180 but it represents both sides of the sphere and these fluctuations are because of the difference between the two sides if inspected closely the difference between the leading edge and the trailing edge pressure coefficients left column of the smooth sphere fig 10 is more than that of the partially superhydrophobic sphere fig 11 which in turn can result in drag coefficient reduction these figures show the variation of the pressure coefficient and the pressure contour during one cycle of vortex shedding the right column of fig 12 compares the vorticity contours of in the wake of the sphere at the reynolds number of 2000 during a vortex shedding cycle while the left column displays the instantaneous iso surface of the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor at the same reynolds number the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor q criterion u ˆ i x j is defined as q u ˆ i x j u ˆ j x i the q criterion contours shown in fig 12 correspond to q 100 cases a c e g are for smooth sphere and sub figures b d f h are for a partially superhydrophobic sphere with the janus angle of 90 the normalized times are a b t 10 85 10 4 that corresponds to the beginning of the cycle c d t 11 3 10 4 corresponds to π 2 phase of shedding e f t 11 75 10 4 corresponds to π phase of shedding and g h t 12 2 10 4 corresponds to 3 π 2 phase of shedding comparison of these figures shows that by imposing the superhydrophobicity condition on walls of the sphere the width and the length of the wake behind the sphere become narrower and more prolonged respectively also in the regions of positive q the vorticity is significant so the iso surface of q is an identifier of the coherent vortices in the flow structure lesieur et al 2005 fig 12 shows that the flow structure is three dimensional and has strong longitudinal vortices spread between the big kelvin helmholtz billows it also demonstrates that the superhydrophobicity wall condition does not alter the presence of the 3d coherent structures case ii backward facing step in order to investigate the impact of superhydrophobicity on the reattachment length and the recirculation region walls of the step have been divided into five sections which were named a1 to a5 as shown in fig 4 at first the superhydrophobicity has been imposed to all sections and then in order to identify the most influential section each of 5 sections was given the same boundary condition individually and the results have been reported in tab 7 the shear stress on a4 and a5 is zero and therefore they are not crucial components for superhydrophobicity imposition although the shear stress is not zero on a1 and a2 they also have an insignificant impact on the reported changes it is obvious from the data presented in table 7 that imposing superhydrophobicity on a1 a2 a4 a5 results in data that is equal to that of the no slip condition it is the a3 element which is the most influential section and thus imposing the superhydrophobicity on only a3 will present results equal to that of the whole geometry a1 to a5 having complete superhydrophobic wall condition the mean dimensionless shear stress on the walls of the backward facing step is studied thoroughly and fig 13 shows the distribution of this variable at the reynolds number of 300 600 1200 it is evident from this figure that the changes in mean dimensionless shear stress are maximum on the a3 element the shear stress is zero on a4 and a5 and therefore they have no impact on the reattachment length and the recirculation area although the changes in the shear stress are non zero on a1 and a2 their impact on such changes is still negligible and thus the section which plays the most influential role on these changes is the a3 element the oscillations near the corner of the step seen in fig 13 are because of the instantaneous creation shedding and interference of the vortex rings with the up downstream flows also the change of patch at x s 40 before and after the step may create sudden changes in flow pattern and hence in the shear stress from fig 13a c it is clear that the most significant amount of change of shear stress on a3 element takes place between 40 82 and 51 now the a3 element shall be split into two sections 40 82 51 superhydrophobic and 51 81 64 smooth the results are presented in table 8 the results suggest that the impact of only one fourth of the a3 element is equal to 95 of the impact of a complete superhydrophobic backward facing step in which all elements are superhydrophobic influence of imposing the slip velocity on a1 and a3 surfaces has also been investigated this slip velocity is normalized by the inlet velocity it can be seen in fig 14 that by increasing the reynolds number the dimensionless slip velocity also increases the slip velocity at a1 increase from 0 02 at re 400 to 0 09 at re 2000 while the average values in a3 are 0 01 0 02 and 0 05 at reynolds number 300 600 and 1200 respectively this means that the effect of superhydrophobicity on the slip velocity increases by the reynolds number it is clear that the minimum point in fig 14b where the velocity reaches zero belongs to the location of reattachment length streamlines of flow in inside a backward facing channel are shown in fig 15 at re 300 600 1200 for both smooth and superhydrophobic cases it is obvious that by increasing the fluid s inlet velocity and consequently the reynolds number more stretched and powerful recirculation region will be formed imposing the superhydrophobicity on the walls of the backward facing step also increases the length of the recirculation region which will diminish by increasing the reynolds number fig 16 compares the vorticity and the q criterion contours of the smooth and the superhydrophobic step it is obvious from these figures that the superhydrophobic wall condition will enlarge the width of the recirculation region by almost 10 analysis of these figures also reveals that the superhydrophobicity also moves the reattachment length further downstream by about 8 5 conclusions the effects of superhydrophobicity on flow characteristics over the three dimensional sphere and the two dimensional backward facing step is investigated numerically using the large eddy simulation method after validating the computational simulation results the correlation for the boundary condition is implemented using a new third type robin boundary condition it is found that the superhydrophobicity in the case of the sphere will result in a reduction of the drag coefficient and an augmentation of the strouhal number and in the backward facing step case moves the reattachment length further downstream and increases the length strength of the recirculation zone furthermore the concept of janus surface is also implemented in both cases to identify the dominant segments in the mentioned changes the numerical results including the surface shear stress and the velocity slip over the wall have shown that imposing the superhydrophobic wall condition on almost half of the sphere surface and three fourths of the backward facing step will have little effect on drag reduction and augmentation of the reattachment length that is while the remaining 50 and 25 sections reduce the drag coefficient and increase the reattachment length almost identical to the whole surfaces being superhydrophobic

slack mooring when point absorber operates in survival conditions besides the snap loads are closely related to the significant wave height and wave peak period the hybrid mooring shows good performance in preventing snap loads the short term mooring fatigue damage is estimated by the t n curve method while the load cycles are counted by the rainflow counting technique based on the measured mooring tension time series the effects of t n curve as well as snap loads on mooring fatigue damage are discussed and the fatigue results of these two mooring systems are compared in the

recent decades due to the global warming air pollution and energy crisis jacobson et al 2015 among other renewable energy resources the wave energy shows several competitive advantages first of all the potential of marine renewable energy is enormous the worldwide wave energy resource is estimated as much as 2 tw thorpe 1999 the uk thorpe 2000 and portugal rusu and guedes soares 2012 rusu and guedes soares 2009 rusu and guedes soares 2012 silva et al 2018 are two countries that have rich wave energy resources and suitable for developing wave energy projects although other european countries cannot be neglected bento et al 2018 gonçalves et al 2014 guedes soares et al 2014a b besides it has been found that the energy density of ocean wave is high clément et al 2002 falnes 2007 furthermore wave energy converters wecs can capture energy up to 90 of the time while only 20 30 percent for wind and solar power device drew et al 2009 pelc and fujita 2002 an overview of wave energy developments is seen in guedes soares et al 2014a b the first generation of wecs are the shoreline static devices and most of these devices are the oscillating wave columns owc full sized owcs prototypes were built and tested in different countries falcão 2000 heath et al 2000 zhang et al 2009 however the wave energy density in shoreline is more limited than the wave energy in open sea as a consequence the third generation wecs i e the floating wecs are becoming the main options for wave energy exploitation some prototypes have conducted full scale tests such as the pelamis emec 2018 pelamis wave power 2018 wiki 2018 penguin wello oy 2018 waveel 3 0 waves4power 2018 and sharp eagle giec 2018 huang et al 2018 in addition to the prototypes numerous wecs concept designs are being considered elhanafi and kim 2018 sheng 2019a 2019b no matter which type of wec to be developed the mooring system whose main role is to keep wecs on station needs to be designed carefully xu et al 2019b the related mooring system analysis for wecs can be found in nava et al 2013 and xiang et al 2019 the mooring system design for wecs shows some key differences to the offshore oil gas exploitation floating platforms in spite of the fact that the experiences learned from the offshore oil gas industries can provide good references the main differences are concluded as i for the wecs whose working principle is to generate energy by utilizing the motion responses the system is usually to be designed to make the natural period of main motion close to the typical wave period of target location bachynski et al 2012 in contrast most of the offshore structures needs to avoid resonance ii the operational water depth of wecs is shallow generally less than 100 m the influence of water level on system dynamics cannot be neglected as a consequence the tidal currents should be considered johanning and wolfram 2005 silva et al 2016 iii the design and installation of mooring system is complex e g sometimes the slopping bottom needs to be considered huang et al 2019 as stated above the wecs mooring system design xu et al 2019b is a big challenge the catenary mooring system is not the preferred solution for wecs station keeping the catenary effect is weakened due to the shallow water as very long and heavy chains are needed in order to make the system compliable enough thomsen et al 2017 as a consequence the footprint would increase dramatically which may not only interfere with other offshore activities but also reduces the number of wecs in the wave energy farm the taut line that comprises wire rope also seems not suitable for wecs mooring since the taut wire mooring is a very stiff system its performance of energy absorption and dissipation is poor consequently the snap loads which can occur in the harsh environmental conditions would induce large extreme loads and considerable damage to the mooring lines hann et al 2015 hsu et al 2014 palm et al 2017 thies et al 2014 the hybrid mooring system which was studied for deepwater offshore platforms station keeping application ji and yuan 2015 xu et al 2018a 2018b has been validated to be a good solution for wecs station keeping in shallow water the main reason is that the hybrid mooring system has good ability in dissipating energy and preventing the snap events in moura paredes et al 2016 it is seen that the hybrid mooring system performs well in reducing loads according to the experimental results a hybrid mooring line consisting of nylon rope chain and floater for flow wave energy converter was numerically studied fonseca et al 2009 the results were compared with the catenary mooring and it was claimed that the hybrid mooring is a much more favourable solution in addition to the hybrid mooring the synthetic rope is popular to be used in wec mooring systems the corresponding studies are found in davies et al 2014 wang et al 2019 and weller et al 2015 the main reason is that the synthetic rope is compliant and has good performance in reducing mooring loads however even the polyester could be too stiff the evidence can be found in the hydrodynamic model tests of a slack polyester mooring line from which the large snap loads in polyester rope were seen when the point absorber operated in survival sea conditions xu et al 2018c a highly compliant fibre rope is needed to reduce mooring peak tensions such as the nylon ridge et al 2010 thomsen et al 2017 2016 and other novel flexible material huang et al 2018 another advantage of fibre rope is that it is much more cost effective than the catenary chain mooring system thomsen et al 2016 it is estimated that the cost of mooring is approximated to 10 of total wec capital cost and this cost as large as 30 to the total one thomsen et al 2017 it indicates that the mooring performance needs to be evaluated carefully to avoid over design the mooring fatigue damage is an important indicator to evaluate mooring long term performance which needs to take great care during mooring design spiral the mooring fatigue life should be greater than wecs service time generally 20 years several studies focused on wecs mooring fatigue damage analysis can be found in thies et al 2011 2014 and yang et al 2017 2016 according to these studies it is seen that the s n curve method based on the linear damage accumulation assumption is the most popular method in mooring fatigue damage estimation the load cycles are counted directly from the time domain simulations yang et al 2017 2016 or measured data thies et al 2011 2014 by the rainflow counting technique matsuishi and endo 1968 it is stated that the decoupled method is not accurate enough for estimating wec mooring fatigue damage yang et al 2016 however even the fully coupled dynamic method may not be accurate enough for wec mooring fatigue analysis when the snap loads occur because the numerical method is not easy to capture the snap events which could account for more than 95 of the fatigue damage thies et al 2011 it is concluded that the mooring system design for wecs still needs to be developed furthermore the effects of snap loads on mooring fatigue damage needs to be discussed carefully in this study a slack and a hybrid mooring system are proposed and their performances are experimentally studied following the work of li et al 2018 and xu et al 2019a the mooring short term fatigue damage in different sea states are estimated based on measured mooring tension time series by t n curve method the effects of wave conditions t n curves snap loads on mooring fatigue damage are discussed in the end of this work the short term mooring fatigue damage uncertainty analysis are conducted with random t n curve parameters and rainflow matrix load cycles considered 2 methodology the jonswap spectrum is used to simulate the irregular wave conditions which is introduced in section 2 1 the measured results of small scale physical model tests need to be converted to full scale prototype results and the corresponding scale rule is described in section 2 3 according to the measured mooring tension time series the mooring fatigue damage is calculated by palmgren miner rule miner 1945 with load cycles counted by rainflow counting algorithm matsuishi and endo 1968 the details are given in section 2 2 2 1 jonswap spectrum the jonswap spectrum is widely used to model the random wave elevations which is expressed as dnvgl rp c205 2017 1 s j ω 1 2905 h s 2 g 2 t z 4 ω 5 exp 5 4 ω p ω 4 γ exp ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 2 where h s is the significant wave height t z is the up crossing period ω p is angular spectral peak frequency γ is the non dimensional peak enhance parameter and is estimated as 2 γ 1 0 t p 5 h s exp 5 75 1 15 t p h s 3 6 h s t p 5 h s 5 0 t p 3 6 h s the non dimensional peak shape factor is expressed as 3 σ 0 07 ω ω p 0 09 ω ω p the relation between t z and peak period t p is estimated as 4 t p 1 407 1 0 287 ln γ 1 4 t z 2 2 mooring fatigue prediction the s n curve is one of the popular methods used for evaluating structure fatigue life which considers the cumulative fatigue damage by counting the number of loading cycles n causes to failure at a particular stress range s by conducting the experiments the number of cycles n can be expressed as a function of cyclic stress range s 5 n k s m where k and m are the intercept and slope parameters respectively as for the mooring fatigue analysis a more convenient t n curve approach is normally used dnvgl offshore standard dnvgl os e301 2015 guedes soares and moan 1991 the definition of t n curve is similar to the s n curve whereas the t is the normalized tension range i e the ratio of tension range to mbl minimum breaking load 6 n k t m eq 6 can be further written as 7 log n log k m log t based on the linear damage accumulation assumption palmgren miner rule miner 1945 the fatigue damage in ith sea state is estimated as 8 d i p i t a d i k n i k n k where d i is the damage under the sea state i in the concerned time period ta p i is the probability of occurrence of sea state i d i is the duration of simulation for sea state i usually 3 h is used subscript k is the index of normalized tension range n k is the number of cycles of k tension range cause to mooring line failure which is obtained according to eq 6 n ik is the number of k tension range under the sea state i the n ik can be estimated directly from the load time series by different cycle counting methods such as rainflow counting downing and socie 1982 matsuishi and endo 1968 range counting peak counting and level cross counting among these various methods the rainflow counting showed the best performance in estimating fatigue damage dowling 1971 the application of rainflow approach in counting stress tension range cycles is explained clearly in marsh et al 2016 in this study a dummy mbl of polyester is used which equals to 15 mn besides this study focus on investigating the influence of mooring design and sea state on short term fatigue damage of mooring line the t a 3 h p i 1 is used in the discussions of each sea state 2 3 froude s law the model tests should satisfy froude s law and the model test results can then be converted to the full scale according to froude similarity the detailed relations between experimental and full scale results of each quantity are given in table 1 where λ is model scale β is the ratio between sea water density and fresh water density which equals to 1 025 subscripts s and m denote full scale and model respectively 3 hydrodynamic model tests 3 1 point absorber and mooring design a fibre reinforced plastic cylinder was acted as the point absorber and its main parameters are given in table 2 where d p indicates the diameter h is the height z g is the z axis coordinate value of centre of gravity relative the bottom the point absorber was kept in station by three mooring lines with the azimuth angle setting as 120 and the top view of mooring lines arrangement is presented fig 1 totally two mooring systems were tested including the slack mooring xu et al 2018c and hybrid mooring the slack mooring sl is a relatively new design which comprised chain down segment and polyester top segment the length of polyester and chain is 1 m and 0 7 m respectively in the normal sea conditions the weight of lifted chain segment provides the restoring force to keep point absorber on station while the stretching of polyester becomes the main contributor once the chain segment is fully lifted up this compact design shows several advantages compared with catenary mooring system such as less occupied area and much more economic the costs of chain and synthetic rope are 4140 tonne and 16 1000 tonne respectively thomsen et al 2016 xu et al 2019b which illustrates that the synthetic rope is much more economic than the chain let alone that the compact mooring is much shorter than the catenary mooring design the main parameters of the chain and polyester are shown in table 3 where d is the nominal diameter wa and ws are per unit mass in air and water respectively ea is the axial stiffness the slack mooring model is shown in fig 2 a the hybrid mooring line wbsl is designed by installing three clump weights and one floater on a slack mooring in order to improve energy absorption performance of mooring line the floater was made of hollow acrylic sphere while the clump weights were made of concrete blocks the clumped weights were attached to the end 0 5 m of mooring line with unified distance 0 2 m it indicates that the distance between anchor point and last weight is 0 1 m the floater was installed between polyester and chain table 4 gives the detail information of floaters where the index of floater is identical to the mooring line e g the fo1 denotes the floater being installed in the 1 mooring line the clump weights in air are shown in table 5 where the definition of clump weights is given in fig 2 b and m denotes the mooring index the mooring radius of these two mooring systems is the same which equals to 1 4 m the pretension of sl and wbsl are 0 7n and 8 1n respectively the drafts of buoy are similar for these two systems despite of the fact that the wbsl has a much greater pretension than sl this is because that the buoy has a great hydrostatic stiffness besides the hanging angle of wbsl is large due to the installation of floater in other words the contribution of pretension on vertical load is small the coordinates of fairleads are listed in table 6 where the origin of z axis is located in the buoy bottom f references to fairlead e g fa1 is the fairlead of 1 mooring line 3 2 experimental set up the 1 100 irregular wave model tests were conducted in the wave basin of the university of porto the wave basin is 28 m long 12 m wide and 1 2 m deep and is equipped with a multidirectional wavemaker which is capable of generating regular and irregular waves the water depth was 0 8 m during the model tests and only the wave was considered due to the fact that the basin is not able to generate wind and current as shown in fig 1 only the head sea condition was tested the six dof motion responses of the point absorber were measured by optical motion tracking system four wave gauges were used to measure wave elevations at different locations along to the wave basin the distances between each wave gauge are 16 cm 18 cm and 51 cm respectively the arrangement of wave gauges is shown in fig 1 a load sensor was installed on the top end of 1 mooring line the most loaded one to record the mooring tension time series prior to conduct experiments the mass properties of point absorber were adjusted accurately by arranging inner rubber ballast besides all the equipment are calibrated before model tests the experimental set up is shown in fig 3 the sampling frequency for acquisition system was set to 40 hz and the duration of each irregular wave model test was set as 20 min four irregular wave conditions including two operational and two survival wave states were tested the irregular waves were modelled by jonswap spectra and the main parameters are shown in table 7 where the definitions of these parameters can be checked in section 2 1 4 test results and discussions the measured results are converted to full scale according to the relations defined in table 1 based on measured mooring tension series the tension cycles are counted by rainflow algorithm once the rainflow matrix is obtained the polyester fatigue damage in each sea state can then be estimated by applying t n curve approach in this study the rainflow matrix are calculated by applying wafo brodtkorb et al 2000 4 1 operational sea state test op1 the generated wave in wave basin needs to be calibrated to maintain the experimental accuracy fig 4 shows the comparison between modelled wave and target one it is seen the configuration of the measured wave spectrum matches well with the target one except for the differences between peak values however the discrepancy is small enough to be neglected it indicates that the generated wave is qualified for the op1 tests the 1 mooring tension time series of these two tested mooring systems are shown in fig 5 where only sequences with 800s duration of the maximum tension value are plotted in order to observe the tension variations clearly it is seen that the wbsl tensions show both the low frequency and wave frequency properties whereas only low frequency characteristic is clearly seen in sl tensions it is understood that the chain segment of sl is lifted up and down to provide restraining force to the slow drift motion response of point absorber which causes mooring tension to vary smoothly with the similar period to the surge motion the pretension of wbsl is much greater than sl and the polyester axial stretching and clump weights provide the main restoring force to the point absorber rather than the chain weight besides the attached floater also increases the wbsl dynamics it indicates that the dynamics of wbsl is much greater than sl which can be validated in mooring tension time series it is seen that the tensions of wbsl vary dramatically with time and the amplitudes are much greater than sl an interesting phenomenon is observed in fig 5 b it is seen that a spike tension occurs around 3400s which is much greater than the normal ones it is explained by a suddenly increased seabed chain segment length which give rise to large motion response of the buoy likely resulting in the spike loads to study the mooring tension characteristics carefully the mooring tension spectra are illustrated in fig 6 it is clearly seen that the sl tension is dominated by the low frequency component whereas both the low frequency component and wave frequency component are important to wbsl tensions more specifically the wave frequency part is the predominant one of wbsl tensions besides a comparison between these two tension spectra indicates that the tension of wbsl is much greater than sl the rainflow counting algorithm is applied to count mooring tension load cycles the results are illustrated in fig 7 where the number in each block is the occurrence of corresponding mooring line tension cycle range it is seen that the load cycles distributions are totally different for these two discussed mooring systems the wbsl load cycles concentrate on large ranges of more than 4000 kn while the small range load cycles less than 400 kn are the majority components of sl rainflow matrix this is explained that the wbsl adopts great pretension and is easy to trigger mooring dynamics and induce great loads johanning et al 2007 as for the sl the effect of axial stretching on mooring dynamics is limited in most cases besides the spike load cycles i e the small load follows by extremely large load during the process when the slack mooring becomes taut suddenly can be observed for both of these two systems the results in fig 7 imply that the fatigue damage of wbsl is greater than sl in this wave state the fatigue damage of each load cycle range can then be estimated by using api t n curve american petroleum institute api 2001 to show the contribution of each load cycle range on total fatigue damage clearly the normalized fatigue damage matrix which is obtained by dividing the fatigue damage of each rainflow matrix cell in fig 7 by the total damage is presented in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 a the frequently occurring large amplitude cycles are the main contributions to the mooring fatigue damages however the spike loads which seldom occur also have significant effect on fatigue damages different from the wbsl a clear indication that the spike loads should get great concern for sl can be found in fig 8 b it is seen most of the sl fatigue damage is caused by the spike loads which account for as much as 80 of total damage this is understood that the number of small amplitude loads are insufficient to induce notable damage to the polyester line while the tremendous spike loads give rise to significant fatigue damage even they are rarely to be seen the total fatigue damage of wbsl and sl are compared in fig 9 in the lg form where the fatigue damage calculated by dnvgl t n curve dnvgl offshore standard dnvgl os e301 2015 is also included in order to discuss the influence of t n curve parameters on fatigue damage it is observed that the wbsl suffer much greater damage than the sl and the result can be validated in fig 7 furthermore the difference of fatigue damage calculated by different methods is clearly seen the discrepancies are 41 and 38 respectively for wbsl and sl this implies that the effect of t n curve is a predominant factor for estimating mooring fatigue damage in op1 4 2 operational sea state test op2 similarly to the op1 the generated irregular wave should be validated before conducting model tests the measured wave elevations as well as the comparison between measured wave spectra and target one are illustrated in fig 10 a good agreement between measured wave spectrum and exact one indicates that the wavemaker is capable to generate the required waves for model tests the mooring tension time series in the concerned durations are displayed in fig 11 it is observed that the sl tension fluctuates gently with the point absorber surge motion until the spike load arises which leads to abrupt increase of mooring loads this phenomenon is clearly seen in fig 11 b around 6650 s both the low frequency and wave frequency components are seen in wbsl tensions besides the variations of wbsl tension are much more dramatic than the sl tension in most cases due to the effect of pretension however the tremendous spike is not clearly seen in fig 11 a this can be understood that the wbsl has great restoring force which helps to prevent the sudden acceleration of point absorber in addition the damping from attached floater and clump weights motions help to dissipate energy from mooring top end fig 12 illustrates the mooring tension spectra of the discussed mooring systems where it is observed that the wbsl tensions consist of low frequency and wave frequency components the most notable spectral peak is found around the natural heave period xu et al 2018c which indicates that the heave motion response plays significant role in wbsl loads the sl tension is dominated by the low frequency component where it is seen that a significant spectra peak occurs near the natural surge period and the wave frequency peak is negligible this finding agrees with the results of op1 the rainflow matrix of wbsl and sl tension cycles in op2 are shown in fig 13 where it is seen that the distribution shapes of the load cycles are similar to op2 despite of the differences of detail values in fig 13 a it is observed that the low amplitude cycles are the most frequent ones however the number of large range loads with different levels are also considerable due to the large mooring dynamics especially for the cycles in the range between 4000 kn and 6000 kn the numerous large amplitude loads would lead to wbsl suffer great fatigue damage let alone the effects of spike loads which have been validated would cause significant damage to mooring lines despite the fact that they are rarely seen the majority of load cycle ranges are less than 500 kn for sl and the large amplitude cycles seldom occur owning to the special design of sl however a spike load with great range is found which would give rise to considerable damage to sl to study the contribution of each rainflow matrix cell to the total damage the normalized fatigue damage matrix of wbsl and sl are presented in fig 14 it is observed that both the large amplitude load cycles and rarely seen spike loads play an important role in wbsl fatigue damage a finding that agrees with the result of op1 however if comparing the damage in each rainflow matrix cell it is seen that the infrequent spike loads are the most important ones to induce mooring fatigue damage rather than the normal large amplitude load cycles which is different from the op1 results this phenomenon is understood noting that the spike tension increases considerably with the significant wave height while the number in each corresponding normal load range cell is not enough to generate comparable damage to the damage produced by spike tensions a clear indication of the importance of spike tensions on sl fatigue damage is observed in fig 14 b where it is seen that the fatigue damage caused by one individual spike tension could be over 90 to the total damage the reason has been explained above i e the spike tension increases significantly with the significant wave height which is dominant to the contributions of small amplitude loads the total fatigue damage estimated by different methods is shown in fig 15 where it is seen that the fatigue damage of wbsl is much greater than sl which is in accordance with the finding in op1 the main reason is the wbsl is easy to onset dynamic loads due to the large pretension which would give rise to considerable damage these results imply that the sl suffers much less damage than wbsl in the operational sea conditions the influence of t n curve on fatigue damage is clear the differences between estimated damage by these two methods are 39 and 36 respectively for wbsl and sl furthermore by comparing the mooring fatigue damage in op2 with the corresponding values in op2 it is seen the significant wave height is strongly associated with mooring fatigue damage compared with op1 the wbsl and sl fatigue damage estimated by api method is increased 4 and 12 respectively it indicates that the fatigue damage of sl is much more sensitive to h s than wbsl 4 3 survival sea state test sv1 the wave calibration result of sv1 is shown in fig 16 where it is seen that the simulated wave in wave basin is in good agreement with the target one despite the discrepancy of peak value which is negligible after calibrating the irregular wave the model tests were conducted the recorded mooring tensions are converted to the full scale and the mooring tension time series in the concerned 800 s durations are shown in fig 17 it is clearly seen that the mooring tension amplitudes are greatly increased due to the enhanced significant wave height where this phenomenon is found for both of these two mooring systems however the influence of h s in the increase of mooring tension responses is different compared with the op1 the maximum mooring tension of wbsl is increased about three times while the maximum sl tension is increased over ten times furthermore a large number of snap loads are observed in the sl mooring tension time series this is because the motion responses of point absorber are increased significantly in sv1 due to the limited restoring force provided by sl as a consequence the sl could transform frequently from a slack configuration to taut suddenly which would induce tremendous snap loads furthermore it is observed that the interval between each snap load is close to the natural surge period which indicates the surge motion is intimately linked to the snap loads in addition to the major snap load several subordinate snap loads can also be found near to the major one this indicates that the heave motion response starts to play significant role on sl mooring dynamics in sv1 the wbsl mooring tension is rather stable to the increase of h s owning to the attached clumped weights and buoy which not only improve the mooring system restoring force but also play an important role in dissipating energy from mooring top end fig 18 illustrates the mooring tension spectra of wbsl and sl where it is seen that the mooring tension spectral densities are increased dramatically due to the enhanced h s the wbsl tension is dominated by the wave frequency component which agrees with the results in operational sea states the sl tension spectrum is a multimodal distribution in addition to the low frequency and wave frequency peaks the high frequency peaks can also be found furthermore it is seen that the sl tension is dominated by wave frequency component which is different from the results in operational sea states the occurrences of rainflow matrix of mooring tension load cycles are shown in fig 19 where it is seen that the majority of sl load cycles start at low level check x axis i e less than 4000 kn and the small range load cycles are the most frequently ones however the numerous extremely large load cycles can be observed because of the snap loads which indicate that the sl fatigue damage would increase significantly as for the wbsl the tension cycles are evenly distributed compared with sl the tension cycles started with different levels are seen in spite of the number of occurrences is reduced with the started level increasing furthermore several load cycles with tremendous ranges are observed which would give rise to considerable fatigue damage according to the results in operational sea states the fatigue damage caused by each cell of load cycles matrix are calculated by the t n curve method and the results are normalized and shown in fig 20 checking fig 19 a it can be clearly seen that these load cycles seldom occur and the cycle that contributes to the most damage is observed to appear only once this is explained that the spike tension range are enlarged dramatically in sv1 as a consequence the damaged caused by other normal tension cycles are not able to compete with almost all the fatigue damage is caused by the snap loads for the sl the damage from massive number of small range cycles are negligible as expected fig 21 shows the total fatigue damage of 1 moorings in sv1 by different methods in contrast with the mooring fatigue damage results in operational sea states it is seen that the fatigue damage in sl is much greater than wbsl this is because of the frequently occurred snap loads whose tremendous large loads cause significant damage to the mooring where the sl tension amplitudes can be seen in fig 17 the influence of wave conditions on mooring fatigue can be clearly seen by comparing the results in fig 9 with fig 21 showing that the wbsl fatigue damage is increased 45 while the sl damage is increased as much as 85 where the comparisons are based on the api method this implies that the wbsl has much better station keeping and energy absorbing performance than sl while the motion responses of point absorber moored by sl are increased significantly in sv1 which gives rise to numerous snap loads the sl fatigue damage is then notably increased the influence of t n curve parameters on mooring fatigue damage can also be observed in fig 21 however the effect is weakened for details the differences between estimated damage by these two methods are 24 for wbsl while only a 6 discrepancy is found for sl the result seems weird since the load cycles of sl in sv1 are enhanced significantly due to the frequently occurred snap loads and the mooring fatigue damage should be more sensitive to the t n curve parameters this could be the reason that the sl fatigue damage is dominated by the seldom occurred snap loads the influence of parameter m on fatigue damage is more important than k in this case fortunately the m value is similar for these two t n curves besides the differences between estimated fatigue damage by these two methods are not accumulated effectively since the fatigue damage is dominated by the snap loads while the effect of numerous small range cycles on fatigue damage is negligible as a consequence api and dnvgl t n curve provide similar estimations of the fatigue damage of sl in sv1 4 4 survival sea state test sv2 the generated wave in sv2 was calibrated before performing irregular wave model tests fig 22 gives the calibration results it is seen in fig 22 b that the configuration of measured wave spectrum matches well with the required one this indicates that the wavemaker is capable of generating qualified wave for studying point absorber mooring system dynamics in sv2 the measured 1 mooring tensions were recorded by the load sensor and then converted to the full scale only the 800 s concerned durations which include the maximum mooring tensions are presented and the result are shown in fig 23 it is seen that the mooring tension amplitudes are reduced significantly compared with the sv1 results especially for the sl both the number of occurrence and amplitudes of snap loads are reduced notably this is explained that the h s in sv1 is slightly greater than sv2 besides the t p in sv1 is much closer to the heave natural period than sv2 xu et al 2018c in other words the influence of heave motion on mooring dynamics has been weakened in sv2 which give rise to the reductions of snap loads directly to study the mooring tension properties carefully the spectral analysis is conducted and the results are shown in fig 24 in consistence with the results in the other sea conditions the wave frequency component dominates to the wave frequency part in the wbsl case this implies that the wbsl shows good performance in restricting the point absorber slow drift motion responses similarly to the sv1 result the sl mooring tensions are composed by low frequency and wave frequency components the difference is the low frequency part is the dominant one in sv2 this reason has been given above which is the t p is away from the point absorber natural period the effect of heave motion on sl tensions is reduced correspondingly the rainflow matrix of mooring tension cycles in 3 h are shown in fig 25 it is observed that the wbsl load cycle distributions are similar to the results in operational sea states as expected the majority of cycles have small ranges however the numerous large cycles in the range between 6000 kn and 11 000 kn can be seen furthermore a tremendous load cycle interval is seen in fig 25 a which would bring large damage to wbsl based on the experiences learned from previous cases the main load cycles are in the range less than 2000 kn for sl while the large range cycles are started from low tensions minimum and rarely to be seen fig 26 illustrates the normalized fatigue matrix where the effect of individual significant load cycle on wbsl fatigue damage can be clearly identified which account for over 20 in the total damage the load cycles which have the range over 10 000 kn cause most of the damage of wbsl despite the fact that these cycles seldom occur besides contributions of moderate level cycles start around 9 000 kn and complete around 16 000 kn 17 000 kn and 18 000 kn on wbsl total damage is visible due to the large number of occurrence which are 106 86 and 83 respectively check fig 25 a in fig 26 b it is observed that almost all the sl fatigue damage are caused by the snap loads e g the two largest snap loads account for more than 50 of the fatigue damage the wbsl and sl total damage are then calculated and compared in fig 27 where it is observed that the fatigue damage of sl is much greater than wbsl due to the effects of snap loads this finding agrees with the sv1 results the effect of wave condition on sl fatigue can be clearly identified it is seen the fatigue damage is increased 71 compared with the damage in op1 however only a 20 increase is found for wbsl this indicates that the wbsl tension responses are not very sensitive to the wave conditions and it shows better survival ability than sl in harsh sea conditions the influence of t n parameters on mooring damage calculation is seen the difference between api and dnvgl method is 34 for wbsl where the difference is only 17 for sl the reason has been given in sec sv1 5 discussion of the uncertainties in fatigue damage analysis it has been shown that the t n curve parameters have some influence on mooring fatigue damage especially for the wbsl the study of uncertainty of k value on riser fatigue damage can be found in li and low 2012 sen 2006 in addition to the uncertainties of t n curve parameters the uncertainties of wave elevations mooring pretension and diameter could also affect the mooring fatigue damage it is not easy to take these uncertainties into consideration in the experimental method however these random variables would lead to the differences of rainflow tension cycle ranges directly in view of this a random factor ξ is introduced to consider the effects of these uncertainties the tension range is then defined as 9 t s ξ max min where max and min are the peak and valley values of rainflow cycles respectively the random variables for mooring fatigue uncertainty analysis are shown in table 8 where the k is supposed to follow the lognormal distribution with the mean value identical to api and the recommended cov in li and low 2012 sen 2006 is used in this study similarly to k the m also follows the lognormal distribution the mean value is identical to api and cov 0 1 is adopted the ξ is assumed to satisfy the normal distribution with the mean value is 1 and cov of 0 1 are used in this study the monte carlo simulation is applied to study the fatigue damage uncertainties and before conducting simulations the k m and ξ need to be sampled the latin hypercube sampling technique is used to sample k and m and ξ is sampled by the monte carlo method with a sample size a 50 000 and the results are shown in fig 28 in the following study only two typical sea states are discussed i e op1 and sv1 the mooring fatigue damage are assessed 50 000 times with different random variables the estimated fatigue damages are then normalized for being convenient to study the histogram of normalized fatigue damage in op1 and sv1 are illustrated in figs 29 and 30 it is observed that the normalized fatigue damages are almost symmetrically distributed about 1 for all discussed cases for a better evaluation of mooring fatigue uncertainties the statistics of normalized fatigue damage are calculated and shown in table 9 it is observed that the mean values of fatigue damage for all discussed cases are close to 1 besides the uncertainties of fatigue damage are not very high and associate with the load cycle ranges the uncertainties of wbsl fatigue damage in op1 and sv1 cases are similar no clear difference is seen however a relative high uncertainty is seen in sl fatigue when point absorber operates in sv1 due to the frequently occurred snap loads 6 conclusions the sl shows good performance in operational sea states its tensions vary slowly with the surge motion response and it suffers less fatigue damage than wbsl however large amplitude spike tensions can still be seen in these sea states the sl mooring tensions are dominated by low frequency components in the survival sea conditions the large amplitude snap loads are seen and the wave frequency components are prominent the number and amplitude of snap loads are closely related to the h s and t p which would be significantly increased once the resonance occurs and h s is large enough the fatigue damage of sl is dominated by the spike tensions where the contributions of spike tensions on the total damage are over 80 for all cases the influence of snap loads on mooring fatigue damage is significant almost all the fatigue damage is caused by the snap loads in the survival conditions besides fatigue damage increases dramatically with the number of snap events e g the fatigue damage is increased by 84 in sv1 compared with the results in op1 both the wave frequency and low frequency play significant roles in wbsl tensions however the wave frequency tension is the dominating one in operational sea states the fatigue damage of wbsl is greater than sl due to its great pretension however the wbsl shows good performance in preventing the occurrence of snap loads the snap loads of wbsl in survival sea states are much less than sl which helps to reduce fatigue damage effectively the sl suffers less fatigue damage in the general operational sea states than the wbsl however it is seen that the fatigue damage of sl is increased tremendously in the survival sea states due to the frequently occurred snap loads the lifetime fatigue depends on the probability of occurrence of those seastates and this requires a long term analysis the influence of different t n curves on wbsl mooring fatigue damage estimation is clear over 24 differences can be found for all studied sea states the discrepancies of sl fatigue damage estimated by api and dnvgl t n curves are also notable in operational sea states however the differences are reduced significantly once the snap loads occur frequently according to the results of mooring fatigue uncertainty analysis it is concluded that the uncertainties of estimated fatigue damage are increased with load tension cycle ranges the sl fatigue damage in sv1 has the largest uncertainty declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgement this work was financially supported by the

22246,two mooring systems namely a slack mooring and a hybrid mooring are proposed for the application of wave energy converters station keeping the performance of these two mooring systems are assessed by hydrodynamic model tests on a point absorber mooring system totally four sea states are considered including two operational and two survival wave conditions the snap events are found in slack mooring when point absorber operates in survival conditions besides the snap loads are closely related to the significant wave height and wave peak period the hybrid mooring shows good performance in preventing snap loads the short term mooring fatigue damage is estimated by the t n curve method while the load cycles are counted by the rainflow counting technique based on the measured mooring tension time series the effects of t n curve as well as snap loads on mooring fatigue damage are discussed and the fatigue results of these two mooring systems are compared in the

recent decades due to the global warming air pollution and energy crisis jacobson et al 2015 among other renewable energy resources the wave energy shows several competitive advantages first of all the potential of marine renewable energy is enormous the worldwide wave energy resource is estimated as much as 2 tw thorpe 1999 the uk thorpe 2000 and portugal rusu and guedes soares 2012 rusu and guedes soares 2009 rusu and guedes soares 2012 silva et al 2018 are two countries that have rich wave energy resources and suitable for developing wave energy projects although other european countries cannot be neglected bento et al 2018 gonçalves et al 2014 guedes soares et al 2014a b besides it has been found that the energy density of ocean wave is high clément et al 2002 falnes 2007 furthermore wave energy converters wecs can capture energy up to 90 of the time while only 20 30 percent for wind and solar power device drew et al 2009 pelc and fujita 2002 an overview of wave energy developments is seen in guedes soares et al 2014a b the first generation of wecs are the shoreline static devices and most of these devices are the oscillating wave columns owc full sized owcs prototypes were built and tested in different countries falcão 2000 heath et al 2000 zhang et al 2009 however the wave energy density in shoreline is more limited than the wave energy in open sea as a consequence the third generation wecs i e the floating wecs are becoming the main options for wave energy exploitation some prototypes have conducted full scale tests such as the pelamis emec 2018 pelamis wave power 2018 wiki 2018 penguin wello oy 2018 waveel 3 0 waves4power 2018 and sharp eagle giec 2018 huang et al 2018 in addition to the prototypes numerous wecs concept designs are being considered elhanafi and kim 2018 sheng 2019a 2019b no matter which type of wec to be developed the mooring system whose main role is to keep wecs on station needs to be designed carefully xu et al 2019b the related mooring system analysis for wecs can be found in nava et al 2013 and xiang et al 2019 the mooring system design for wecs shows some key differences to the offshore oil gas exploitation floating platforms in spite of the fact that the experiences learned from the offshore oil gas industries can provide good references the main differences are concluded as i for the wecs whose working principle is to generate energy by utilizing the motion responses the system is usually to be designed to make the natural period of main motion close to the typical wave period of target location bachynski et al 2012 in contrast most of the offshore structures needs to avoid resonance ii the operational water depth of wecs is shallow generally less than 100 m the influence of water level on system dynamics cannot be neglected as a consequence the tidal currents should be considered johanning and wolfram 2005 silva et al 2016 iii the design and installation of mooring system is complex e g sometimes the slopping bottom needs to be considered huang et al 2019 as stated above the wecs mooring system design xu et al 2019b is a big challenge the catenary mooring system is not the preferred solution for wecs station keeping the catenary effect is weakened due to the shallow water as very long and heavy chains are needed in order to make the system compliable enough thomsen et al 2017 as a consequence the footprint would increase dramatically which may not only interfere with other offshore activities but also reduces the number of wecs in the wave energy farm the taut line that comprises wire rope also seems not suitable for wecs mooring since the taut wire mooring is a very stiff system its performance of energy absorption and dissipation is poor consequently the snap loads which can occur in the harsh environmental conditions would induce large extreme loads and considerable damage to the mooring lines hann et al 2015 hsu et al 2014 palm et al 2017 thies et al 2014 the hybrid mooring system which was studied for deepwater offshore platforms station keeping application ji and yuan 2015 xu et al 2018a 2018b has been validated to be a good solution for wecs station keeping in shallow water the main reason is that the hybrid mooring system has good ability in dissipating energy and preventing the snap events in moura paredes et al 2016 it is seen that the hybrid mooring system performs well in reducing loads according to the experimental results a hybrid mooring line consisting of nylon rope chain and floater for flow wave energy converter was numerically studied fonseca et al 2009 the results were compared with the catenary mooring and it was claimed that the hybrid mooring is a much more favourable solution in addition to the hybrid mooring the synthetic rope is popular to be used in wec mooring systems the corresponding studies are found in davies et al 2014 wang et al 2019 and weller et al 2015 the main reason is that the synthetic rope is compliant and has good performance in reducing mooring loads however even the polyester could be too stiff the evidence can be found in the hydrodynamic model tests of a slack polyester mooring line from which the large snap loads in polyester rope were seen when the point absorber operated in survival sea conditions xu et al 2018c a highly compliant fibre rope is needed to reduce mooring peak tensions such as the nylon ridge et al 2010 thomsen et al 2017 2016 and other novel flexible material huang et al 2018 another advantage of fibre rope is that it is much more cost effective than the catenary chain mooring system thomsen et al 2016 it is estimated that the cost of mooring is approximated to 10 of total wec capital cost and this cost as large as 30 to the total one thomsen et al 2017 it indicates that the mooring performance needs to be evaluated carefully to avoid over design the mooring fatigue damage is an important indicator to evaluate mooring long term performance which needs to take great care during mooring design spiral the mooring fatigue life should be greater than wecs service time generally 20 years several studies focused on wecs mooring fatigue damage analysis can be found in thies et al 2011 2014 and yang et al 2017 2016 according to these studies it is seen that the s n curve method based on the linear damage accumulation assumption is the most popular method in mooring fatigue damage estimation the load cycles are counted directly from the time domain simulations yang et al 2017 2016 or measured data thies et al 2011 2014 by the rainflow counting technique matsuishi and endo 1968 it is stated that the decoupled method is not accurate enough for estimating wec mooring fatigue damage yang et al 2016 however even the fully coupled dynamic method may not be accurate enough for wec mooring fatigue analysis when the snap loads occur because the numerical method is not easy to capture the snap events which could account for more than 95 of the fatigue damage thies et al 2011 it is concluded that the mooring system design for wecs still needs to be developed furthermore the effects of snap loads on mooring fatigue damage needs to be discussed carefully in this study a slack and a hybrid mooring system are proposed and their performances are experimentally studied following the work of li et al 2018 and xu et al 2019a the mooring short term fatigue damage in different sea states are estimated based on measured mooring tension time series by t n curve method the effects of wave conditions t n curves snap loads on mooring fatigue damage are discussed in the end of this work the short term mooring fatigue damage uncertainty analysis are conducted with random t n curve parameters and rainflow matrix load cycles considered 2 methodology the jonswap spectrum is used to simulate the irregular wave conditions which is introduced in section 2 1 the measured results of small scale physical model tests need to be converted to full scale prototype results and the corresponding scale rule is described in section 2 3 according to the measured mooring tension time series the mooring fatigue damage is calculated by palmgren miner rule miner 1945 with load cycles counted by rainflow counting algorithm matsuishi and endo 1968 the details are given in section 2 2 2 1 jonswap spectrum the jonswap spectrum is widely used to model the random wave elevations which is expressed as dnvgl rp c205 2017 1 s j ω 1 2905 h s 2 g 2 t z 4 ω 5 exp 5 4 ω p ω 4 γ exp ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 2 where h s is the significant wave height t z is the up crossing period ω p is angular spectral peak frequency γ is the non dimensional peak enhance parameter and is estimated as 2 γ 1 0 t p 5 h s exp 5 75 1 15 t p h s 3 6 h s t p 5 h s 5 0 t p 3 6 h s the non dimensional peak shape factor is expressed as 3 σ 0 07 ω ω p 0 09 ω ω p the relation between t z and peak period t p is estimated as 4 t p 1 407 1 0 287 ln γ 1 4 t z 2 2 mooring fatigue prediction the s n curve is one of the popular methods used for evaluating structure fatigue life which considers the cumulative fatigue damage by counting the number of loading cycles n causes to failure at a particular stress range s by conducting the experiments the number of cycles n can be expressed as a function of cyclic stress range s 5 n k s m where k and m are the intercept and slope parameters respectively as for the mooring fatigue analysis a more convenient t n curve approach is normally used dnvgl offshore standard dnvgl os e301 2015 guedes soares and moan 1991 the definition of t n curve is similar to the s n curve whereas the t is the normalized tension range i e the ratio of tension range to mbl minimum breaking load 6 n k t m eq 6 can be further written as 7 log n log k m log t based on the linear damage accumulation assumption palmgren miner rule miner 1945 the fatigue damage in ith sea state is estimated as 8 d i p i t a d i k n i k n k where d i is the damage under the sea state i in the concerned time period ta p i is the probability of occurrence of sea state i d i is the duration of simulation for sea state i usually 3 h is used subscript k is the index of normalized tension range n k is the number of cycles of k tension range cause to mooring line failure which is obtained according to eq 6 n ik is the number of k tension range under the sea state i the n ik can be estimated directly from the load time series by different cycle counting methods such as rainflow counting downing and socie 1982 matsuishi and endo 1968 range counting peak counting and level cross counting among these various methods the rainflow counting showed the best performance in estimating fatigue damage dowling 1971 the application of rainflow approach in counting stress tension range cycles is explained clearly in marsh et al 2016 in this study a dummy mbl of polyester is used which equals to 15 mn besides this study focus on investigating the influence of mooring design and sea state on short term fatigue damage of mooring line the t a 3 h p i 1 is used in the discussions of each sea state 2 3 froude s law the model tests should satisfy froude s law and the model test results can then be converted to the full scale according to froude similarity the detailed relations between experimental and full scale results of each quantity are given in table 1 where λ is model scale β is the ratio between sea water density and fresh water density which equals to 1 025 subscripts s and m denote full scale and model respectively 3 hydrodynamic model tests 3 1 point absorber and mooring design a fibre reinforced plastic cylinder was acted as the point absorber and its main parameters are given in table 2 where d p indicates the diameter h is the height z g is the z axis coordinate value of centre of gravity relative the bottom the point absorber was kept in station by three mooring lines with the azimuth angle setting as 120 and the top view of mooring lines arrangement is presented fig 1 totally two mooring systems were tested including the slack mooring xu et al 2018c and hybrid mooring the slack mooring sl is a relatively new design which comprised chain down segment and polyester top segment the length of polyester and chain is 1 m and 0 7 m respectively in the normal sea conditions the weight of lifted chain segment provides the restoring force to keep point absorber on station while the stretching of polyester becomes the main contributor once the chain segment is fully lifted up this compact design shows several advantages compared with catenary mooring system such as less occupied area and much more economic the costs of chain and synthetic rope are 4140 tonne and 16 1000 tonne respectively thomsen et al 2016 xu et al 2019b which illustrates that the synthetic rope is much more economic than the chain let alone that the compact mooring is much shorter than the catenary mooring design the main parameters of the chain and polyester are shown in table 3 where d is the nominal diameter wa and ws are per unit mass in air and water respectively ea is the axial stiffness the slack mooring model is shown in fig 2 a the hybrid mooring line wbsl is designed by installing three clump weights and one floater on a slack mooring in order to improve energy absorption performance of mooring line the floater was made of hollow acrylic sphere while the clump weights were made of concrete blocks the clumped weights were attached to the end 0 5 m of mooring line with unified distance 0 2 m it indicates that the distance between anchor point and last weight is 0 1 m the floater was installed between polyester and chain table 4 gives the detail information of floaters where the index of floater is identical to the mooring line e g the fo1 denotes the floater being installed in the 1 mooring line the clump weights in air are shown in table 5 where the definition of clump weights is given in fig 2 b and m denotes the mooring index the mooring radius of these two mooring systems is the same which equals to 1 4 m the pretension of sl and wbsl are 0 7n and 8 1n respectively the drafts of buoy are similar for these two systems despite of the fact that the wbsl has a much greater pretension than sl this is because that the buoy has a great hydrostatic stiffness besides the hanging angle of wbsl is large due to the installation of floater in other words the contribution of pretension on vertical load is small the coordinates of fairleads are listed in table 6 where the origin of z axis is located in the buoy bottom f references to fairlead e g fa1 is the fairlead of 1 mooring line 3 2 experimental set up the 1 100 irregular wave model tests were conducted in the wave basin of the university of porto the wave basin is 28 m long 12 m wide and 1 2 m deep and is equipped with a multidirectional wavemaker which is capable of generating regular and irregular waves the water depth was 0 8 m during the model tests and only the wave was considered due to the fact that the basin is not able to generate wind and current as shown in fig 1 only the head sea condition was tested the six dof motion responses of the point absorber were measured by optical motion tracking system four wave gauges were used to measure wave elevations at different locations along to the wave basin the distances between each wave gauge are 16 cm 18 cm and 51 cm respectively the arrangement of wave gauges is shown in fig 1 a load sensor was installed on the top end of 1 mooring line the most loaded one to record the mooring tension time series prior to conduct experiments the mass properties of point absorber were adjusted accurately by arranging inner rubber ballast besides all the equipment are calibrated before model tests the experimental set up is shown in fig 3 the sampling frequency for acquisition system was set to 40 hz and the duration of each irregular wave model test was set as 20 min four irregular wave conditions including two operational and two survival wave states were tested the irregular waves were modelled by jonswap spectra and the main parameters are shown in table 7 where the definitions of these parameters can be checked in section 2 1 4 test results and discussions the measured results are converted to full scale according to the relations defined in table 1 based on measured mooring tension series the tension cycles are counted by rainflow algorithm once the rainflow matrix is obtained the polyester fatigue damage in each sea state can then be estimated by applying t n curve approach in this study the rainflow matrix are calculated by applying wafo brodtkorb et al 2000 4 1 operational sea state test op1 the generated wave in wave basin needs to be calibrated to maintain the experimental accuracy fig 4 shows the comparison between modelled wave and target one it is seen the configuration of the measured wave spectrum matches well with the target one except for the differences between peak values however the discrepancy is small enough to be neglected it indicates that the generated wave is qualified for the op1 tests the 1 mooring tension time series of these two tested mooring systems are shown in fig 5 where only sequences with 800s duration of the maximum tension value are plotted in order to observe the tension variations clearly it is seen that the wbsl tensions show both the low frequency and wave frequency properties whereas only low frequency characteristic is clearly seen in sl tensions it is understood that the chain segment of sl is lifted up and down to provide restraining force to the slow drift motion response of point absorber which causes mooring tension to vary smoothly with the similar period to the surge motion the pretension of wbsl is much greater than sl and the polyester axial stretching and clump weights provide the main restoring force to the point absorber rather than the chain weight besides the attached floater also increases the wbsl dynamics it indicates that the dynamics of wbsl is much greater than sl which can be validated in mooring tension time series it is seen that the tensions of wbsl vary dramatically with time and the amplitudes are much greater than sl an interesting phenomenon is observed in fig 5 b it is seen that a spike tension occurs around 3400s which is much greater than the normal ones it is explained by a suddenly increased seabed chain segment length which give rise to large motion response of the buoy likely resulting in the spike loads to study the mooring tension characteristics carefully the mooring tension spectra are illustrated in fig 6 it is clearly seen that the sl tension is dominated by the low frequency component whereas both the low frequency component and wave frequency component are important to wbsl tensions more specifically the wave frequency part is the predominant one of wbsl tensions besides a comparison between these two tension spectra indicates that the tension of wbsl is much greater than sl the rainflow counting algorithm is applied to count mooring tension load cycles the results are illustrated in fig 7 where the number in each block is the occurrence of corresponding mooring line tension cycle range it is seen that the load cycles distributions are totally different for these two discussed mooring systems the wbsl load cycles concentrate on large ranges of more than 4000 kn while the small range load cycles less than 400 kn are the majority components of sl rainflow matrix this is explained that the wbsl adopts great pretension and is easy to trigger mooring dynamics and induce great loads johanning et al 2007 as for the sl the effect of axial stretching on mooring dynamics is limited in most cases besides the spike load cycles i e the small load follows by extremely large load during the process when the slack mooring becomes taut suddenly can be observed for both of these two systems the results in fig 7 imply that the fatigue damage of wbsl is greater than sl in this wave state the fatigue damage of each load cycle range can then be estimated by using api t n curve american petroleum institute api 2001 to show the contribution of each load cycle range on total fatigue damage clearly the normalized fatigue damage matrix which is obtained by dividing the fatigue damage of each rainflow matrix cell in fig 7 by the total damage is presented in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 a the frequently occurring large amplitude cycles are the main contributions to the mooring fatigue damages however the spike loads which seldom occur also have significant effect on fatigue damages different from the wbsl a clear indication that the spike loads should get great concern for sl can be found in fig 8 b it is seen most of the sl fatigue damage is caused by the spike loads which account for as much as 80 of total damage this is understood that the number of small amplitude loads are insufficient to induce notable damage to the polyester line while the tremendous spike loads give rise to significant fatigue damage even they are rarely to be seen the total fatigue damage of wbsl and sl are compared in fig 9 in the lg form where the fatigue damage calculated by dnvgl t n curve dnvgl offshore standard dnvgl os e301 2015 is also included in order to discuss the influence of t n curve parameters on fatigue damage it is observed that the wbsl suffer much greater damage than the sl and the result can be validated in fig 7 furthermore the difference of fatigue damage calculated by different methods is clearly seen the discrepancies are 41 and 38 respectively for wbsl and sl this implies that the effect of t n curve is a predominant factor for estimating mooring fatigue damage in op1 4 2 operational sea state test op2 similarly to the op1 the generated irregular wave should be validated before conducting model tests the measured wave elevations as well as the comparison between measured wave spectra and target one are illustrated in fig 10 a good agreement between measured wave spectrum and exact one indicates that the wavemaker is capable to generate the required waves for model tests the mooring tension time series in the concerned durations are displayed in fig 11 it is observed that the sl tension fluctuates gently with the point absorber surge motion until the spike load arises which leads to abrupt increase of mooring loads this phenomenon is clearly seen in fig 11 b around 6650 s both the low frequency and wave frequency components are seen in wbsl tensions besides the variations of wbsl tension are much more dramatic than the sl tension in most cases due to the effect of pretension however the tremendous spike is not clearly seen in fig 11 a this can be understood that the wbsl has great restoring force which helps to prevent the sudden acceleration of point absorber in addition the damping from attached floater and clump weights motions help to dissipate energy from mooring top end fig 12 illustrates the mooring tension spectra of the discussed mooring systems where it is observed that the wbsl tensions consist of low frequency and wave frequency components the most notable spectral peak is found around the natural heave period xu et al 2018c which indicates that the heave motion response plays significant role in wbsl loads the sl tension is dominated by the low frequency component where it is seen that a significant spectra peak occurs near the natural surge period and the wave frequency peak is negligible this finding agrees with the results of op1 the rainflow matrix of wbsl and sl tension cycles in op2 are shown in fig 13 where it is seen that the distribution shapes of the load cycles are similar to op2 despite of the differences of detail values in fig 13 a it is observed that the low amplitude cycles are the most frequent ones however the number of large range loads with different levels are also considerable due to the large mooring dynamics especially for the cycles in the range between 4000 kn and 6000 kn the numerous large amplitude loads would lead to wbsl suffer great fatigue damage let alone the effects of spike loads which have been validated would cause significant damage to mooring lines despite the fact that they are rarely seen the majority of load cycle ranges are less than 500 kn for sl and the large amplitude cycles seldom occur owning to the special design of sl however a spike load with great range is found which would give rise to considerable damage to sl to study the contribution of each rainflow matrix cell to the total damage the normalized fatigue damage matrix of wbsl and sl are presented in fig 14 it is observed that both the large amplitude load cycles and rarely seen spike loads play an important role in wbsl fatigue damage a finding that agrees with the result of op1 however if comparing the damage in each rainflow matrix cell it is seen that the infrequent spike loads are the most important ones to induce mooring fatigue damage rather than the normal large amplitude load cycles which is different from the op1 results this phenomenon is understood noting that the spike tension increases considerably with the significant wave height while the number in each corresponding normal load range cell is not enough to generate comparable damage to the damage produced by spike tensions a clear indication of the importance of spike tensions on sl fatigue damage is observed in fig 14 b where it is seen that the fatigue damage caused by one individual spike tension could be over 90 to the total damage the reason has been explained above i e the spike tension increases significantly with the significant wave height which is dominant to the contributions of small amplitude loads the total fatigue damage estimated by different methods is shown in fig 15 where it is seen that the fatigue damage of wbsl is much greater than sl which is in accordance with the finding in op1 the main reason is the wbsl is easy to onset dynamic loads due to the large pretension which would give rise to considerable damage these results imply that the sl suffers much less damage than wbsl in the operational sea conditions the influence of t n curve on fatigue damage is clear the differences between estimated damage by these two methods are 39 and 36 respectively for wbsl and sl furthermore by comparing the mooring fatigue damage in op2 with the corresponding values in op2 it is seen the significant wave height is strongly associated with mooring fatigue damage compared with op1 the wbsl and sl fatigue damage estimated by api method is increased 4 and 12 respectively it indicates that the fatigue damage of sl is much more sensitive to h s than wbsl 4 3 survival sea state test sv1 the wave calibration result of sv1 is shown in fig 16 where it is seen that the simulated wave in wave basin is in good agreement with the target one despite the discrepancy of peak value which is negligible after calibrating the irregular wave the model tests were conducted the recorded mooring tensions are converted to the full scale and the mooring tension time series in the concerned 800 s durations are shown in fig 17 it is clearly seen that the mooring tension amplitudes are greatly increased due to the enhanced significant wave height where this phenomenon is found for both of these two mooring systems however the influence of h s in the increase of mooring tension responses is different compared with the op1 the maximum mooring tension of wbsl is increased about three times while the maximum sl tension is increased over ten times furthermore a large number of snap loads are observed in the sl mooring tension time series this is because the motion responses of point absorber are increased significantly in sv1 due to the limited restoring force provided by sl as a consequence the sl could transform frequently from a slack configuration to taut suddenly which would induce tremendous snap loads furthermore it is observed that the interval between each snap load is close to the natural surge period which indicates the surge motion is intimately linked to the snap loads in addition to the major snap load several subordinate snap loads can also be found near to the major one this indicates that the heave motion response starts to play significant role on sl mooring dynamics in sv1 the wbsl mooring tension is rather stable to the increase of h s owning to the attached clumped weights and buoy which not only improve the mooring system restoring force but also play an important role in dissipating energy from mooring top end fig 18 illustrates the mooring tension spectra of wbsl and sl where it is seen that the mooring tension spectral densities are increased dramatically due to the enhanced h s the wbsl tension is dominated by the wave frequency component which agrees with the results in operational sea states the sl tension spectrum is a multimodal distribution in addition to the low frequency and wave frequency peaks the high frequency peaks can also be found furthermore it is seen that the sl tension is dominated by wave frequency component which is different from the results in operational sea states the occurrences of rainflow matrix of mooring tension load cycles are shown in fig 19 where it is seen that the majority of sl load cycles start at low level check x axis i e less than 4000 kn and the small range load cycles are the most frequently ones however the numerous extremely large load cycles can be observed because of the snap loads which indicate that the sl fatigue damage would increase significantly as for the wbsl the tension cycles are evenly distributed compared with sl the tension cycles started with different levels are seen in spite of the number of occurrences is reduced with the started level increasing furthermore several load cycles with tremendous ranges are observed which would give rise to considerable fatigue damage according to the results in operational sea states the fatigue damage caused by each cell of load cycles matrix are calculated by the t n curve method and the results are normalized and shown in fig 20 checking fig 19 a it can be clearly seen that these load cycles seldom occur and the cycle that contributes to the most damage is observed to appear only once this is explained that the spike tension range are enlarged dramatically in sv1 as a consequence the damaged caused by other normal tension cycles are not able to compete with almost all the fatigue damage is caused by the snap loads for the sl the damage from massive number of small range cycles are negligible as expected fig 21 shows the total fatigue damage of 1 moorings in sv1 by different methods in contrast with the mooring fatigue damage results in operational sea states it is seen that the fatigue damage in sl is much greater than wbsl this is because of the frequently occurred snap loads whose tremendous large loads cause significant damage to the mooring where the sl tension amplitudes can be seen in fig 17 the influence of wave conditions on mooring fatigue can be clearly seen by comparing the results in fig 9 with fig 21 showing that the wbsl fatigue damage is increased 45 while the sl damage is increased as much as 85 where the comparisons are based on the api method this implies that the wbsl has much better station keeping and energy absorbing performance than sl while the motion responses of point absorber moored by sl are increased significantly in sv1 which gives rise to numerous snap loads the sl fatigue damage is then notably increased the influence of t n curve parameters on mooring fatigue damage can also be observed in fig 21 however the effect is weakened for details the differences between estimated damage by these two methods are 24 for wbsl while only a 6 discrepancy is found for sl the result seems weird since the load cycles of sl in sv1 are enhanced significantly due to the frequently occurred snap loads and the mooring fatigue damage should be more sensitive to the t n curve parameters this could be the reason that the sl fatigue damage is dominated by the seldom occurred snap loads the influence of parameter m on fatigue damage is more important than k in this case fortunately the m value is similar for these two t n curves besides the differences between estimated fatigue damage by these two methods are not accumulated effectively since the fatigue damage is dominated by the snap loads while the effect of numerous small range cycles on fatigue damage is negligible as a consequence api and dnvgl t n curve provide similar estimations of the fatigue damage of sl in sv1 4 4 survival sea state test sv2 the generated wave in sv2 was calibrated before performing irregular wave model tests fig 22 gives the calibration results it is seen in fig 22 b that the configuration of measured wave spectrum matches well with the required one this indicates that the wavemaker is capable of generating qualified wave for studying point absorber mooring system dynamics in sv2 the measured 1 mooring tensions were recorded by the load sensor and then converted to the full scale only the 800 s concerned durations which include the maximum mooring tensions are presented and the result are shown in fig 23 it is seen that the mooring tension amplitudes are reduced significantly compared with the sv1 results especially for the sl both the number of occurrence and amplitudes of snap loads are reduced notably this is explained that the h s in sv1 is slightly greater than sv2 besides the t p in sv1 is much closer to the heave natural period than sv2 xu et al 2018c in other words the influence of heave motion on mooring dynamics has been weakened in sv2 which give rise to the reductions of snap loads directly to study the mooring tension properties carefully the spectral analysis is conducted and the results are shown in fig 24 in consistence with the results in the other sea conditions the wave frequency component dominates to the wave frequency part in the wbsl case this implies that the wbsl shows good performance in restricting the point absorber slow drift motion responses similarly to the sv1 result the sl mooring tensions are composed by low frequency and wave frequency components the difference is the low frequency part is the dominant one in sv2 this reason has been given above which is the t p is away from the point absorber natural period the effect of heave motion on sl tensions is reduced correspondingly the rainflow matrix of mooring tension cycles in 3 h are shown in fig 25 it is observed that the wbsl load cycle distributions are similar to the results in operational sea states as expected the majority of cycles have small ranges however the numerous large cycles in the range between 6000 kn and 11 000 kn can be seen furthermore a tremendous load cycle interval is seen in fig 25 a which would bring large damage to wbsl based on the experiences learned from previous cases the main load cycles are in the range less than 2000 kn for sl while the large range cycles are started from low tensions minimum and rarely to be seen fig 26 illustrates the normalized fatigue matrix where the effect of individual significant load cycle on wbsl fatigue damage can be clearly identified which account for over 20 in the total damage the load cycles which have the range over 10 000 kn cause most of the damage of wbsl despite the fact that these cycles seldom occur besides contributions of moderate level cycles start around 9 000 kn and complete around 16 000 kn 17 000 kn and 18 000 kn on wbsl total damage is visible due to the large number of occurrence which are 106 86 and 83 respectively check fig 25 a in fig 26 b it is observed that almost all the sl fatigue damage are caused by the snap loads e g the two largest snap loads account for more than 50 of the fatigue damage the wbsl and sl total damage are then calculated and compared in fig 27 where it is observed that the fatigue damage of sl is much greater than wbsl due to the effects of snap loads this finding agrees with the sv1 results the effect of wave condition on sl fatigue can be clearly identified it is seen the fatigue damage is increased 71 compared with the damage in op1 however only a 20 increase is found for wbsl this indicates that the wbsl tension responses are not very sensitive to the wave conditions and it shows better survival ability than sl in harsh sea conditions the influence of t n parameters on mooring damage calculation is seen the difference between api and dnvgl method is 34 for wbsl where the difference is only 17 for sl the reason has been given in sec sv1 5 discussion of the uncertainties in fatigue damage analysis it has been shown that the t n curve parameters have some influence on mooring fatigue damage especially for the wbsl the study of uncertainty of k value on riser fatigue damage can be found in li and low 2012 sen 2006 in addition to the uncertainties of t n curve parameters the uncertainties of wave elevations mooring pretension and diameter could also affect the mooring fatigue damage it is not easy to take these uncertainties into consideration in the experimental method however these random variables would lead to the differences of rainflow tension cycle ranges directly in view of this a random factor ξ is introduced to consider the effects of these uncertainties the tension range is then defined as 9 t s ξ max min where max and min are the peak and valley values of rainflow cycles respectively the random variables for mooring fatigue uncertainty analysis are shown in table 8 where the k is supposed to follow the lognormal distribution with the mean value identical to api and the recommended cov in li and low 2012 sen 2006 is used in this study similarly to k the m also follows the lognormal distribution the mean value is identical to api and cov 0 1 is adopted the ξ is assumed to satisfy the normal distribution with the mean value is 1 and cov of 0 1 are used in this study the monte carlo simulation is applied to study the fatigue damage uncertainties and before conducting simulations the k m and ξ need to be sampled the latin hypercube sampling technique is used to sample k and m and ξ is sampled by the monte carlo method with a sample size a 50 000 and the results are shown in fig 28 in the following study only two typical sea states are discussed i e op1 and sv1 the mooring fatigue damage are assessed 50 000 times with different random variables the estimated fatigue damages are then normalized for being convenient to study the histogram of normalized fatigue damage in op1 and sv1 are illustrated in figs 29 and 30 it is observed that the normalized fatigue damages are almost symmetrically distributed about 1 for all discussed cases for a better evaluation of mooring fatigue uncertainties the statistics of normalized fatigue damage are calculated and shown in table 9 it is observed that the mean values of fatigue damage for all discussed cases are close to 1 besides the uncertainties of fatigue damage are not very high and associate with the load cycle ranges the uncertainties of wbsl fatigue damage in op1 and sv1 cases are similar no clear difference is seen however a relative high uncertainty is seen in sl fatigue when point absorber operates in sv1 due to the frequently occurred snap loads 6 conclusions the sl shows good performance in operational sea states its tensions vary slowly with the surge motion response and it suffers less fatigue damage than wbsl however large amplitude spike tensions can still be seen in these sea states the sl mooring tensions are dominated by low frequency components in the survival sea conditions the large amplitude snap loads are seen and the wave frequency components are prominent the number and amplitude of snap loads are closely related to the h s and t p which would be significantly increased once the resonance occurs and h s is large enough the fatigue damage of sl is dominated by the spike tensions where the contributions of spike tensions on the total damage are over 80 for all cases the influence of snap loads on mooring fatigue damage is significant almost all the fatigue damage is caused by the snap loads in the survival conditions besides fatigue damage increases dramatically with the number of snap events e g the fatigue damage is increased by 84 in sv1 compared with the results in op1 both the wave frequency and low frequency play significant roles in wbsl tensions however the wave frequency tension is the dominating one in operational sea states the fatigue damage of wbsl is greater than sl due to its great pretension however the wbsl shows good performance in preventing the occurrence of snap loads the snap loads of wbsl in survival sea states are much less than sl which helps to reduce fatigue damage effectively the sl suffers less fatigue damage in the general operational sea states than the wbsl however it is seen that the fatigue damage of sl is increased tremendously in the survival sea states due to the frequently occurred snap loads the lifetime fatigue depends on the probability of occurrence of those seastates and this requires a long term analysis the influence of different t n curves on wbsl mooring fatigue damage estimation is clear over 24 differences can be found for all studied sea states the discrepancies of sl fatigue damage estimated by api and dnvgl t n curves are also notable in operational sea states however the differences are reduced significantly once the snap loads occur frequently according to the results of mooring fatigue uncertainty analysis it is concluded that the uncertainties of estimated fatigue damage are increased with load tension cycle ranges the sl fatigue damage in sv1 has the largest uncertainty declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgement this work was financially supported by the

22247,in the present study the effects of a moving surface on the aerodynamic characteristics of an offshore wind turbine blade were numerically examined the s809 airfoil was considered as the blade section a part of the airfoil surface was replaced with a moving surface as a flow control mechanism to achieve the highest mechanical performance of the airfoil at each angle of attack the effects of location and speed of the moving surface on the flow characteristics were studied the flow simulation was carried out using a computational fluid dynamics technique the results of this study indicated that the use of a moving surface with appropriate speed and location could enhance the airfoil performance as the angle of attack increased a stronger moving surface was needed the performance

subscript 1 introduction the increasing need for energy limitation of fossil fuels and increasing environmental pollution caused by them the issue of air warming and the effects of greenhouse phenomena and acid rainfall and the need to balance the release of the carbon monoxide are among issues that highlight the need for the reduction of fossil fuel consumption and increase in clean production this important point attracts attentions to the use of renewable energy resources among the renewable energies wind energy is one of the most economic resources of generating electricity that does not endanger the environment and is endless most of wind energy conversion machines are classified into two types of horizontal axis wind turbines hawts and vertical axis wind turbines vawts installing vawts is affordable because of their simple structure however they are difficult to be commercialized because of their low efficiency hawts are an example of industrial turbines that have higher efficiency than other types of wind turbines wind turbines are aerodynamically divided into two categories as lift driven and drag driven the blade section of a lift driven wind turbine is generally an airfoil the aerodynamic performance of an airfoil is usually defined as the lift to drag ratio l d therefore the better the aerodynamic performance of the blade the more torque is generated by the turbine many studies have been done on the aerodynamic performance of wind turbines liu et al 2017 numerically studied the stall phenomenon on an s809 airfoil as the blade section of a hawt furthermore they investigated the blade vibration effect on the wind turbine using the blade element momentum bem theory rezaeiha et al 2017 simulated the flow around a vawt using a computational fluid dynamics cfd technique and studied the effect of pith angle on the aerodynamic performance and the power generated by the turbine moreover tahani et al 2017 optimized the geometry of a wind turbine blade using the bem theory in a turbulent flow regime sagharichi et al 2018 numerically studied the solidity effects on a vawt performance their results indicated that at higher solidities the variable pitch blades could generate more torque furthermore benim et al 2018 also studied the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic characteristics of a small hawt with a quasi 3d optimization marinić kragić et al 2019 numerically investigated the performance of a flexible blade vawt they could optimize the blade shape with 8 enhancement in the turbine power kavari et al 2019 numerically studied the wind shear on the aerodynamic performance of a hawt using bem method they found that the root region of the turbine blade was not significantly affected by the wind shear moreover song et al 2019 studied the performance of a micro horizontal axis diffuser augmented turbine using experiment and numerical simulation in addition wang et al 2019 numerically analyzed a horizontal axis micro hydrokinetic river turbine with a tip speed ratio of 6 the lift force generated by an airfoil blade section increases by increasing the angle of attack and reaches the highest value at a specific angle called the stall angle but after that it suddenly decreases the use of flow control methods can lead to an increase in the stall angle and consequently the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil may be enhanced various flow control mechanisms have been investigated regarding the airfoil aerodynamic performance such as blowing suction co flow jet vortex generator synthetic jet actuator surface roughness and moving surface mittal 2001 xu et al 2015 used a co flow jet to improve the aerodynamic performance of an s809 airfoil by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations and the spalart allmaras turbulence model moreover wang et al 2017 numerically studied the effect of the vortex generator on the aerodynamic performance of the s809 airfoil moshfeghi and hur 2017 numerically studied the effects of a synthetic jet actuator on the aerodynamic performance of an s809 airfoil for the range of angle of attack which was between 0 and 25 in addition wang et al 2018a b numerically improved the performance of a hawt using a control cylinder near the blade leading edge based on the computational fluid dynamics using ansys cfx software their results showed that this flow control mechanism could improve the turbine torque to 27 furthermore mamouri et al 2019a 2019b performed an analysis of the entropy generation on some blades of offshore wind turbine such as s825 s822 and sd7062 in two cases of static and dynamic stall conditions at the reynolds number of 106 an energy harvesting performance about flapping foils was also studied by wang et al 2018a b and li et al 2018 in the laminar flow regime many studies have also been performed on the flow control using the moving surface mechanism one of the earliest experiments on the flow control by a moving wall for boundary layer control was carried out by favre 1938 he used an airfoil with the upper surface formed by a moving belt over two rollers and succeeded to delay the flow separation until the angle of attack reached to 55 in addition modi et al 1981 1991 1992 investigated the aerodynamic characteristics of a number of airfoils with rotating cylinders as the moving surfaces their investigations indicated that use of a rotating cylinder on the leading edge could enhance the maximum lift coefficient by 2 73 and also delayed the stall angle of attack by 48 furthermore al garni et al 2000 used a leading edge rotating cylinder as a moving surface on a naca 0024 airfoil and could increase the lift coefficient from 0 85 to 1 63 and delayed the stall angle of the airfoil by about 160 modi 1997 also presented a review article about moving surface boundary layer control msbc on the airfoils and compared the effects of the different positions of the rotating elements used for injecting the momentum sahu et al 2011 also used a rotating element located at the front of a naca 0012 airfoil to inject the momentum into the boundary layer moreover salimipour and salimipour 2019 numerically investigated the effects of moving surface locations on the power and drag coefficients and vortex shedding state of a circular cylinder at several surface speeds in the laminar regime he found out that some of the moving surfaces reduced the drag coefficient and total power requirements of the system motion the optimum location and the speed of the surfaces corresponding to the minimum power coefficient were also obtained the flow control issue involves optimization with either flow tracking or performance optimization as its objective functions however the solution of a constrained optimization problem when the unsteady navier stokes equations are being solved is not computationally possible therefore a number of optimal flow control techniques were developed abergel and temam 1990 gad el hak 1996 homescu et al 2002 medjo et al 2008 in the present study the flow control on the blade section using moving surface mechanism is numerically studied at the reynolds number of 7 5 105 and angles of attack 5 α 28 ramsay et al 1995 an s809 airfoil is chosen as the blade section this airfoil is one of the most popular airfoils in the existing commercial product that is usually used for hawts the length of the moving surface is 10 of the airfoil chord length the location of the moving surface on the airfoil is in the range of 0 01 s 0 55 and the moving surface speed ratio varies between 1 and 5 none of the previous research studies have obtained the optimum location of the moving surface on the s809 airfoil which causes the maximizing the power generated by the offshore wind turbine furthermore an improved three equation turbulence model is used that can predict the turbulence for the considered angles of attack for a moving surface the relative motion between the surface and the free stream is decreased therefore the growth of the boundary layer is reduced in addition the surface motion injects an additional momentum into the boundary layer gad el hak and bushnell 1991 accordingly the objectives of the current study can be summarized as follows the numerical simulation of the flow around the s809 airfoil using a revised turbulence model the use of msbc concept to control the flow separation of the airfoil the investigation of the effects of the surface locations on mechanical performance of the airfoil at various surface speeds an attempt to obtain the optimum location and speed of the moving surface corresponding to the maximum mechanical performance at each angle of attack the computation of the torque and power coefficient of a medium scale three bladed hawt using the blade element momentum bem theory for two cases of the baseline and msbc blade to mount the moving surface on the airfoil a belt like surface with downstream motion performed by a pulley drive system can be used as shown in fig 1 k and s represent the moving surface speed ratio and non dimensional location of the moving surface respectively to achieve the above mentioned objectives two in house computer codes are utilized one for the solution of the navier stokes equations using a cfd technique and another one for the calculation of the torque and power generated by the offshore wind turbine which uses the bem method several validation cases are presented to validate the present solvers the outline of the present study is in three sections as follows effects of moving surface on the flow field effects of moving surface on the mechanical performance performance analysis of three bladed hawt 2 materials and methods governing equations include the two dimensional incompressible and viscous form of the continuity and momentum equations the differential form of these equations as explained in ref rajagopalan and lestari 2016 can be written as follows 1 ρ u x ρ v y 0 2 ρ u τ j u x x j u y y p x 3 ρ v τ j v x x j v y y p y where ρ is the fluid density p denotes the static pressure and j u x j u y j v x and j v y are the sum of diffusive and convective fluxes defined as follows 4 j u x ρ u u μ μ t r e u x j u y ρ u v μ μ t r e u y j v x ρ u v μ μ t r e v x j v y ρ v v μ μ t r e v y where μ is the molecular dynamic viscosity and μ t denotes the turbulent eddy viscosity the lengths of the above mentioned equations are normalized with the chord length c flow velocities with the free stream velocity u physical time τ with c u and pressure p with ρu 2 the governing equations 1 3 are solved in a general curvilinear coordinate system using a cell vertex finite volume scheme a pressure velocity coupling algorithm proposed by rajagopalan and lestari 2016 is used to discrete the above mentioned equations the momentum equation is discretized with second order temporal and special accuracy furthermore the pressure equation is numerically solved using a strongly implicit procedure sip developed by stone 1968 in order to simulate the eddy viscosity μ t a revised version of the k k l ω turbulence model proposed by salimipour 2019 is used since there are the long separation bubbles at higher angles of attack this revised model can predict these bubbles better than the other turbulence models salimipour 2019 by solving the above mentioned equations numerically the required flow parameters such as pressure and velocity components are computed and then the streamlines as well as the lift drag and power consumption coefficients can be obtained these coefficients are defined as follows 5 c l f l 1 2 ρ u 2 c 6 c d f d 1 2 ρ u 2 c 7 c d m s f d m s 1 2 ρ u 2 c 8 c p c f d m s u m s 1 2 ρ u 3 c k c d m s where c d m s u m s and c p c represent the moving surface drag frictional moving surface speed and power consumption coefficients respectively f l and f d denote the lift and drag forces of the airfoil respectively moreover f d m s is the moving surface drag force and k u m s u is defined as the ratio of the moving surface speed to the free stream velocity additionally f d m s is computed by integration of the shear stress on the moving surface the performance of the turbine blade is a function of the power consumption of the moving surface due to the fact that the moving surface consumes an external power therefore along with the aerodynamic performance l d mechanical performance can be defined as follows 9 η c l c d c p c the increase in the surface speed increases the lift force and decreases the drag force due to the increase in the stall angle however the power consumption is increased therefore an optimum condition for the moving surface must be found at each angle of attack 3 mesh generation and boundary conditions to numerically solve the equations mentioned above a computational domain is needed in the present study an o type mesh with diameter of 30 times the airfoil chord length and first cell size y 1 is used to simulate the flow field a computer with 8 gb ram and 5 cpus with 3 2 ghz frequency is utilized the convergence criterion is based on the normalized continuity equation error which is less than 6 orders of magnitude fig 2 a depicts a view of the above mentioned grid according to the grid an inflow velocity boundary an inner solid boundary airfoil surface and a pressure outlet boundary are required as shown in fig 2 b on the airfoil surface the velocity components are equal to zero also the normal gradient of the pressure is set to zero on the moving surface region the boundary velocity is equal to the moving surface velocity and the pressure is obtained by adjacent cell extrapolation 4 results and discussions 4 1 code validation and mesh independence study the present solver code has been tested in several case studies as presented in refs salimipour 2019 salimipour and salimipour 2019 and can be regarded as reliable for the present simulations however the findings of some case studies are compared with the experimental results obtained by ramsay et al 1995 which include the pressure lift and drag coefficients of the baseline s809 airfoil fig 3 depicts the results of the comparison of the pressure distribution coefficients at the reynolds number of 7 5 105 for the angles of attack α 14 16 18 and 19 a good agreement is obtained except for the leading edge at α 18 so that the present solver illustrates a leading edge separation moreover a comparison is made between the lift and drag coefficients and the experimental data as shown in fig 4 an acceptable correspondence with the experimental data is observed the maximum difference is 10 for the lift coefficient at α 16 to evaluate the solver ability for msbc airfoils the average lift coefficient of a naca 0024 airfoil with a rotating cylinder as a moving surface on its leading edge with k 3 is compared with the experimental data from al garni et al 2000 as shown in fig 5 a reasonable accordance is achieved between the present results and experimental data the difference between the results is maybe due to the replacement of the rotating cylinder used in the experimental setup with a moving surface this causes the magnus effect generated by the rotating cylinder to be removed since the discretized governing equations are solved on computational mesh the mesh size may affect the results therefore a mesh study is required for this purpose three meshes with 330 65 400 80 and 500 100 cells are examined table 1 presents the comparison of the lift and drag coefficients of the airfoil at α 14 and 17 between the above mentioned meshes at moving surface speed ratio of 3 and moving surface location of 0 45 the results seem to be close together for 400 80 and 500 100 cells therefore the mesh with 500 100 cells is chosen for the flow simulations 4 2 effects of moving surface on the flow field the moving surface mechanism injects an additional momentum into the boundary layer as a result it can overcome the adverse pressure gradient and reduce the region of the separated flow to address this issue a comparison is made between the baseline airfoil and three msbc airfoils at α 17 with speed ratios k 2 3 and 4 at moving surface location s 0 45 with regard to the streamlines around the airfoil the results of this comparison are shown in fig 6 a large separation region is observed on the upper surface of the baseline airfoil for the msbc cases as the speed ratio increases the separation region shrinks this leads to an increase in the lift coefficient and a decrease in the drag coefficient consequently the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil will be enhanced a close up view of the velocity vectors near the moving surface is also shown in fig 7 for the baseline airfoil a reverse flow is formed while for the msbc airfoil with k 2 the velocity vectors are aligned to the downstream fig 7 b also demonstrates that the velocity at the vicinity of the moving surface is strongly altered because of the high adverse pressure gradient at a turbulent flow with re 7 5 105 4 3 effects of moving surface on the mechanical performance in order to examine the effects of moving surface on the mechanical performance of the s908 airfoil a moving surface with 0 1 chord length and various speed ratios i e k 1 to 5 are used this surface is placed at six locations from s 0 01 to 0 55 chord length see fig 1 as mentioned above by injecting the additional momentum into the boundary layer using moving surface the flow separation is delayed on the other hand as the moving surface speed increases the power consumption requirement increases therefore it is necessary to apply an appropriate speed to the moving surface fig 8 shows the msbc effects on the mechanical performance η defined by eq 9 as a function of moving surface location for various speed ratios and five angles of attack including α 8 11 14 17 and 20 the performance of the baseline airfoil is also depicted in this figure as can be seen an increase in the angle of attack leads to a decrease in the performance of the baseline airfoil due to the increase in the drag force for the msbc airfoils at the leading edge zone s 0 15 and α 17 a slight improvement in the mechanical performance is observed because in this range of the angles of attack the flow separation occurs on a region near the trailing edge of the airfoil as shown in fig 6 therefore due to the energy losses along the boundary layer the momentum is not sufficiently transferred toward the trailing edge it can also be seen that the best performance is obtained at s 0 45 for α 17 at α 8 the performance of the baseline airfoil is 44 5 while at s 0 45 and k 1 the performance reaches the highest value of η 57 9 in fact the moving surface enhances the mechanical performance by 30 compared with the baseline airfoil at α 11 the baseline airfoil has a performance of η 44 5 the maximum mechanical performance is 53 5 which is achieved at s 0 45 and k 2 the performance improvement at this angle of attack is 62 at α 14 the performance of the baseline airfoil is 19 using a moving surface with s 0 45 and k 3 causes the airfoil performance to reach a maximum value of η 44 in other words the airfoil performance is enhanced by 131 compared with the baseline airfoil at α 14 at α 17 the value of η for the baseline airfoil is 13 8 the performances of the msbc airfoil at k 3 and 4 and s 0 45 are similar thus it is better to choose the moving surface with a lower speed the mechanical performance at k 3 is equal to 34 8 and the improvement is 152 at α 20 the results are fundamentally different the baseline performance is dramatically dropped to 2 2 at this angle the flow is separated from the leading edge of the airfoil as shown in fig 9 a consequently the entire upper surface of the airfoil is in the stall condition furthermore according to fig 8 e it is found that the moving surface increases the mechanical performance only at s 0 01 which is placed right on the leading edge the maximum mechanical performance obtained at α 20 is equal to η 21 fig 9 b and c show the flow field around the msbc airfoils at k 4 for s 0 01 and 0 45 respectively the moving surface at s 0 01 completely eliminates the leading edge stall however a trailing edge separation exists at s 0 45 the moving surface cannot control the stall phenomenon at α 5 the moving surface has no significant effect on the airfoil performance this is because the flow is not separated at this angle at α 28 the pressure gradient is very intense and consequently the moving surface does not have the ability to overcome it therefore at α 5 and 28 the moving surface is not used finally the highest performance at each angle of attack is extracted from fig 8 and the corresponding lift and drag coefficients along with the results of the baseline airfoil are shown in fig 10 a higher lift coefficient and a lower drag coefficient are achieved by the msbc airfoils compared with that of the baseline airfoil 4 4 performance analysis of three bladed hawt the results presented in the previous section were related to a single two dimensional airfoil while the flow around an offshore wind turbine is three dimensional so that the free stream velocity is perpendicular to the turbine plane furthermore an offshore wind turbine has a finite number of blades therefore the turbine performance is also a function of the flow crossing through the turbine blades the aim of this subsection is to study the effect of moving surface on the torque and power generation of a three bladed hawt see fig 11 and to explore the result of their comparison with the baseline turbine blade element momentum bem method is one of the approaches that is used for calculating the torque and power generated by wind turbines this method is a combination of two methods including disk actuator theory and blade element theory tahani et al 2017 in order to enhance the aerodynamic performance a twist angle is applied to the blade therefore the angle of attack is obtained as follows 10 α ϕ ψ where ϕ and ψ are the inflow and twist angle respectively as shown in fig 11 the inflow angle is defined as the angle between the rotor rotation plane and the relative wind speed as follows hansen 2015 11 ϕ t a n 1 1 a u 1 a r ω where ω is the angular velocity and a and a denote the axial and tangential induction factors respectively these factors are expressed as follows 12 a 1 4 q s i n 2 ϕ σ c n 1 13 a 1 4 q s i n ϕ c o s ϕ σ c t 1 where q is the prandtl s tip loss factor σ is the local solidity and c n and c t denote the normal and tangential force coefficients respectively which can be written as follows 14 q 2 π c o s 1 e x p b r r 2 r s i n ϕ 15 σ b c 2 π r 16 c n c l c o s ϕ c d s i n ϕ 17 c t c l s i n ϕ c d c o s ϕ where r and b are the blade radius and number of blades respectively the torque generated by the turbine is calculated as follows 18 m ρ b u 2 ω 2 1 a 1 a s i n ϕ c o s ϕ c c t r d r by multiplying the torque by the angular velocity the total power of the rotor is obtained finally by subtracting the power consumption by the moving surface from the total power the net power coefficient is computed as follows 19 c p 8 λ 2 q λ r 3 a 1 a 1 c d c l c o t φ d λ r 1 π r 2 c c p c 1 λ r 3 2 d r where λ rω u is the tip speed ratio tsr and λ r rω u is the local tip speed ratio in order to use the bem method the blade is divided into sections in the present study eight sections for the blade are used the blade root is located at r r 0 2 and the radius of the blade is equal to 17 m table 2 presents the geometrical parameters of the blade the bem method needs an iterative process at each tsr and each section that can be summarized as follows 1 make an initial guess for the axial and tangential induction factors a and a 2 calculate the inflow angle ϕ employing eq 11 3 calculate the angle of attack α by eq 10 4 calculate the normal and tangential force coefficients c n and c t at the desired angle of attack using eqs 16 and 17 5 compute a and a using eqs 12 and 13 6 if a and a have not converged go to 2 7 compute the torque and power coefficient of the turbine rotor the calculations for the baseline blade and the msbc blade under the optimum conditions according to fig 10 are performed at a range of tsr between 4 and 9 fig 12 shows the results of the comparison between the baseline and msbc turbine in respects of the torque at low tip speed ratios the turbine torque is dramatically enhanced this is due to the fact that as the speed ratio decreases the angle of attack increases as mentioned in the previous subsection at higher angles of attack up to α 25 the aerodynamic performance of the msbc airfoils is better therefore the turbine performance is highly improved at lower tip speed ratios the maximum torque generated by the msbc turbine is 19 45 which is achieved at λ 4 5 while for the baseline turbine the maximum torque is 13 25 at λ 6 5 fig 13 depicts the power coefficient of the offshore wind turbine as a function of tsr for the baseline and msbc turbines a comparison with the result of qblade software is also presented in this figure the qblade software calculates the offshore wind turbines performance using a flow solver method along with the bem theory generally an acceptable agreement is observed between the present result and qblade data at low tsrs corresponded to the higher angles of attack there are some differences between the results due to the existence of long separation bubble in the flow field in fact the software uses a simpler turbulence model that cannot accurately predict the long separation bubbles while the turbulence model used in the present solver accurately predicts the separation bubbles see ref salimipour 2019 moreover the comparison between the baseline and msbc turbines indicates that because of the moving surface at lower tip speed ratios the turbine has a higher power coefficient than that of the baseline turbine therefore it is possible to use a low tsr turbine while a significant power can be extracted this is important in terms of safety as well as the durability of offshore wind turbine components the maximum power coefficient of the msbc turbine is 0 45 which is achieved at λ 7 while for the baseline turbine the maximum power coefficient is 0 4 at λ 7 7 it should be noted that the use of a moving surface is not only useful in reducing the stall occurrence but also at low angles of attack by increasing the momentum on the upper surface of the airfoil leads to enhancing the airfoil performance therefore for the higher tsrs the power coefficient also increases fig 14 shows the percent improvement of the msbc turbine relative to the baseline turbine as a function of tsr a considerable percent improvement in the turbine performance is observed at lower tip speed ratios at λ 4 the improvement is about 200 as the tip speed ratio increases the blade sections encounter with less stall conditions in fact the moving surface effects are reduced as a result the performance improvement extremely decreases so that for λ 4 it reaches to 35 and for λ 7 the improvement is about 10 at a certain tsr the angle of attack is different at each blade section however a wind turbine usually operates at a constant tsr therefore it is possible to adjust the location and speed of the moving surface for each section table 3 presents the best location and speed of the moving surface for each section at tsr 4 and 9 since each part of the blade needs a different moving surface the blade can be divided into several sections and for each section the appropriate moving surface can be placed as mentioned earlier a belt like surface with downstream motion performed by a pulley drive system can be used to move the surface the torque required to rotate the pulley may be provided by an electric motor 5 conclusions in the present study the flow around the s809 airfoil was numerically simulated with and without moving surface the simulation was carried out based on the numerical simulation of the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations at the reynolds number of 7 5 105 a moving surface with the length of 0 1c at the locations from 0 01 c to 0 55 c and the speed ratios between 1 and 5 was located on the upper surface of the airfoil the moving surface could decrease the separated flow region by injecting the additional momentum into the boundary layer this led to an increase in the lift coefficient and a decrease in the drag coefficient as a result the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil was improved the findings obtained from the present study for the turbine blade section s809 airfoil can be summarized as follows by using a moving surface with the appropriate speed and location the aerodynamic and mechanical performance of the airfoil was enhanced the best location of the moving surface for α 8 11 14 and 17 was at s 0 45 and for α 20 it was at s 0 01 at α 5 and α 28 the moving surface had no effect the improvements for the mechanical performance of the airfoil were 30 62 131 152 and 800 for α 8 11 14 17 and 20 respectively moreover the generated torque and power coefficient of a three bladed hawt for two cases of the baseline and msbc blades were obtained using the bem method for 4 λ 9 the moving surface significantly improved the turbine performance especially at low tsrs the maximum torque generated by the msbc turbine was 19 45 at λ 4 5 while for the baseline turbine the maximum torque was 13 25 at λ 6 5 the percent improvement of the msbc turbine relative to the baseline turbine was 200 at λ 4 and 10 at λ 9 for future investigations a parametric study on the length and number of the moving surfaces at different reynolds numbers can be suggested appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this article multimedia component 1

22247,in the present study the effects of a moving surface on the aerodynamic characteristics of an offshore wind turbine blade were numerically examined the s809 airfoil was considered as the blade section a part of the airfoil surface was replaced with a moving surface as a flow control mechanism to achieve the highest mechanical performance of the airfoil at each angle of attack the effects of location and speed of the moving surface on the flow characteristics were studied the flow simulation was carried out using a computational fluid dynamics technique the results of this study indicated that the use of a moving surface with appropriate speed and location could enhance the airfoil performance as the angle of attack increased a stronger moving surface was needed the performance improvement for α 8 11 14 and 17 was 30 62 131 and 152 respectively in addition the performance of a three bladed horizontal axis wind turbine was numerically analyzed in the range of tip speed ratio

production this important point attracts attentions to the use of renewable energy resources among the renewable energies wind energy is one of the most economic resources of generating electricity that does not endanger the environment and is endless most of wind energy conversion machines are classified into two types of horizontal axis wind turbines hawts and vertical axis wind turbines vawts installing vawts is affordable because of their simple structure however they are difficult to be commercialized because of their low efficiency hawts are an example of industrial turbines that have higher efficiency than other types of wind turbines wind turbines are aerodynamically divided into two categories as lift driven and drag driven the blade section of a lift driven wind turbine is generally an airfoil the aerodynamic performance of an airfoil is usually defined as the lift to drag ratio l d therefore the better the aerodynamic performance of the blade the more torque is generated by the turbine many studies have been done on the aerodynamic performance of wind turbines liu et al 2017 numerically studied the stall phenomenon on an s809 airfoil as the blade section of a hawt furthermore they investigated the blade vibration effect on the wind turbine using the blade element momentum bem theory rezaeiha et al 2017 simulated the flow around a vawt using a computational fluid dynamics cfd technique and studied the effect of pith angle on the aerodynamic performance and the power generated by the turbine moreover tahani et al 2017 optimized the geometry of a wind turbine blade using the bem theory in a turbulent flow regime sagharichi et al 2018 numerically studied the solidity effects on a vawt performance their results indicated that at higher solidities the variable pitch blades could generate more torque furthermore benim et al 2018 also studied the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic characteristics of a small hawt with a quasi 3d optimization marinić kragić et al 2019 numerically investigated the performance of a flexible blade vawt they could optimize the blade shape with 8 enhancement in the turbine power kavari et al 2019 numerically studied the wind shear on the aerodynamic performance of a hawt using bem method they found that the root region of the turbine blade was not significantly affected by the wind shear moreover song et al 2019 studied the performance of a micro horizontal axis diffuser augmented turbine using experiment and numerical simulation in addition wang et al 2019 numerically analyzed a horizontal axis micro hydrokinetic river turbine with a tip speed ratio of 6 the lift force generated by an airfoil blade section increases by increasing the angle of attack and reaches the highest value at a specific angle called the stall angle but after that it suddenly decreases the use of flow control methods can lead to an increase in the stall angle and consequently the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil may be enhanced various flow control mechanisms have been investigated regarding the airfoil aerodynamic performance such as blowing suction co flow jet vortex generator synthetic jet actuator surface roughness and moving surface mittal 2001 xu et al 2015 used a co flow jet to improve the aerodynamic performance of an s809 airfoil by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations and the spalart allmaras turbulence model moreover wang et al 2017 numerically studied the effect of the vortex generator on the aerodynamic performance of the s809 airfoil moshfeghi and hur 2017 numerically studied the effects of a synthetic jet actuator on the aerodynamic performance of an s809 airfoil for the range of angle of attack which was between 0 and 25 in addition wang et al 2018a b numerically improved the performance of a hawt using a control cylinder near the blade leading edge based on the computational fluid dynamics using ansys cfx software their results showed that this flow control mechanism could improve the turbine torque to 27 furthermore mamouri et al 2019a 2019b performed an analysis of the entropy generation on some blades of offshore wind turbine such as s825 s822 and sd7062 in two cases of static and dynamic stall conditions at the reynolds number of 106 an energy harvesting performance about flapping foils was also studied by wang et al 2018a b and li et al 2018 in the laminar flow regime many studies have also been performed on the flow control using the moving surface mechanism one of the earliest experiments on the flow control by a moving wall for boundary layer control was carried out by favre 1938 he used an airfoil with the upper surface formed by a moving belt over two rollers and succeeded to delay the flow separation until the angle of attack reached to 55 in addition modi et al 1981 1991 1992 investigated the aerodynamic characteristics of a number of airfoils with rotating cylinders as the moving surfaces their investigations indicated that use of a rotating cylinder on the leading edge could enhance the maximum lift coefficient by 2 73 and also delayed the stall angle of attack by 48 furthermore al garni et al 2000 used a leading edge rotating cylinder as a moving surface on a naca 0024 airfoil and could increase the lift coefficient from 0 85 to 1 63 and delayed the stall angle of the airfoil by about 160 modi 1997 also presented a review article about moving surface boundary layer control msbc on the airfoils and compared the effects of the different positions of the rotating elements used for injecting the momentum sahu et al 2011 also used a rotating element located at the front of a naca 0012 airfoil to inject the momentum into the boundary layer moreover salimipour and salimipour 2019 numerically investigated the effects of moving surface locations on the power and drag coefficients and vortex shedding state of a circular cylinder at several surface speeds in the laminar regime he found out that some of the moving surfaces reduced the drag coefficient and total power requirements of the system motion the optimum location and the speed of the surfaces corresponding to the minimum power coefficient were also obtained the flow control issue involves optimization with either flow tracking or performance optimization as its objective functions however the solution of a constrained optimization problem when the unsteady navier stokes equations are being solved is not computationally possible therefore a number of optimal flow control techniques were developed abergel and temam 1990 gad el hak 1996 homescu et al 2002 medjo et al 2008 in the present study the flow control on the blade section using moving surface mechanism is numerically studied at the reynolds number of 7 5 105 and angles of attack 5 α 28 ramsay et al 1995 an s809 airfoil is chosen as the blade section this airfoil is one of the most popular airfoils in the existing commercial product that is usually used for hawts the length of the moving surface is 10 of the airfoil chord length the location of the moving surface on the airfoil is in the range of 0 01 s 0 55 and the moving surface speed ratio varies between 1 and 5 none of the previous research studies have obtained the optimum location of the moving surface on the s809 airfoil which causes the maximizing the power generated by the offshore wind turbine furthermore an improved three equation turbulence model is used that can predict the turbulence for the considered angles of attack for a moving surface the relative motion between the surface and the free stream is decreased therefore the growth of the boundary layer is reduced in addition the surface motion injects an additional momentum into the boundary layer gad el hak and bushnell 1991 accordingly the objectives of the current study can be summarized as follows the numerical simulation of the flow around the s809 airfoil using a revised turbulence model the use of msbc concept to control the flow separation of the airfoil the investigation of the effects of the surface locations on mechanical performance of the airfoil at various surface speeds an attempt to obtain the optimum location and speed of the moving surface corresponding to the maximum mechanical performance at each angle of attack the computation of the torque and power coefficient of a medium scale three bladed hawt using the blade element momentum bem theory for two cases of the baseline and msbc blade to mount the moving surface on the airfoil a belt like surface with downstream motion performed by a pulley drive system can be used as shown in fig 1 k and s represent the moving surface speed ratio and non dimensional location of the moving surface respectively to achieve the above mentioned objectives two in house computer codes are utilized one for the solution of the navier stokes equations using a cfd technique and another one for the calculation of the torque and power generated by the offshore wind turbine which uses the bem method several validation cases are presented to validate the present solvers the outline of the present study is in three sections as follows effects of moving surface on the flow field effects of moving surface on the mechanical performance performance analysis of three bladed hawt 2 materials and methods governing equations include the two dimensional incompressible and viscous form of the continuity and momentum equations the differential form of these equations as explained in ref rajagopalan and lestari 2016 can be written as follows 1 ρ u x ρ v y 0 2 ρ u τ j u x x j u y y p x 3 ρ v τ j v x x j v y y p y where ρ is the fluid density p denotes the static pressure and j u x j u y j v x and j v y are the sum of diffusive and convective fluxes defined as follows 4 j u x ρ u u μ μ t r e u x j u y ρ u v μ μ t r e u y j v x ρ u v μ μ t r e v x j v y ρ v v μ μ t r e v y where μ is the molecular dynamic viscosity and μ t denotes the turbulent eddy viscosity the lengths of the above mentioned equations are normalized with the chord length c flow velocities with the free stream velocity u physical time τ with c u and pressure p with ρu 2 the governing equations 1 3 are solved in a general curvilinear coordinate system using a cell vertex finite volume scheme a pressure velocity coupling algorithm proposed by rajagopalan and lestari 2016 is used to discrete the above mentioned equations the momentum equation is discretized with second order temporal and special accuracy furthermore the pressure equation is numerically solved using a strongly implicit procedure sip developed by stone 1968 in order to simulate the eddy viscosity μ t a revised version of the k k l ω turbulence model proposed by salimipour 2019 is used since there are the long separation bubbles at higher angles of attack this revised model can predict these bubbles better than the other turbulence models salimipour 2019 by solving the above mentioned equations numerically the required flow parameters such as pressure and velocity components are computed and then the streamlines as well as the lift drag and power consumption coefficients can be obtained these coefficients are defined as follows 5 c l f l 1 2 ρ u 2 c 6 c d f d 1 2 ρ u 2 c 7 c d m s f d m s 1 2 ρ u 2 c 8 c p c f d m s u m s 1 2 ρ u 3 c k c d m s where c d m s u m s and c p c represent the moving surface drag frictional moving surface speed and power consumption coefficients respectively f l and f d denote the lift and drag forces of the airfoil respectively moreover f d m s is the moving surface drag force and k u m s u is defined as the ratio of the moving surface speed to the free stream velocity additionally f d m s is computed by integration of the shear stress on the moving surface the performance of the turbine blade is a function of the power consumption of the moving surface due to the fact that the moving surface consumes an external power therefore along with the aerodynamic performance l d mechanical performance can be defined as follows 9 η c l c d c p c the increase in the surface speed increases the lift force and decreases the drag force due to the increase in the stall angle however the power consumption is increased therefore an optimum condition for the moving surface must be found at each angle of attack 3 mesh generation and boundary conditions to numerically solve the equations mentioned above a computational domain is needed in the present study an o type mesh with diameter of 30 times the airfoil chord length and first cell size y 1 is used to simulate the flow field a computer with 8 gb ram and 5 cpus with 3 2 ghz frequency is utilized the convergence criterion is based on the normalized continuity equation error which is less than 6 orders of magnitude fig 2 a depicts a view of the above mentioned grid according to the grid an inflow velocity boundary an inner solid boundary airfoil surface and a pressure outlet boundary are required as shown in fig 2 b on the airfoil surface the velocity components are equal to zero also the normal gradient of the pressure is set to zero on the moving surface region the boundary velocity is equal to the moving surface velocity and the pressure is obtained by adjacent cell extrapolation 4 results and discussions 4 1 code validation and mesh independence study the present solver code has been tested in several case studies as presented in refs salimipour 2019 salimipour and salimipour 2019 and can be regarded as reliable for the present simulations however the findings of some case studies are compared with the experimental results obtained by ramsay et al 1995 which include the pressure lift and drag coefficients of the baseline s809 airfoil fig 3 depicts the results of the comparison of the pressure distribution coefficients at the reynolds number of 7 5 105 for the angles of attack α 14 16 18 and 19 a good agreement is obtained except for the leading edge at α 18 so that the present solver illustrates a leading edge separation moreover a comparison is made between the lift and drag coefficients and the experimental data as shown in fig 4 an acceptable correspondence with the experimental data is observed the maximum difference is 10 for the lift coefficient at α 16 to evaluate the solver ability for msbc airfoils the average lift coefficient of a naca 0024 airfoil with a rotating cylinder as a moving surface on its leading edge with k 3 is compared with the experimental data from al garni et al 2000 as shown in fig 5 a reasonable accordance is achieved between the present results and experimental data the difference between the results is maybe due to the replacement of the rotating cylinder used in the experimental setup with a moving surface this causes the magnus effect generated by the rotating cylinder to be removed since the discretized governing equations are solved on computational mesh the mesh size may affect the results therefore a mesh study is required for this purpose three meshes with 330 65 400 80 and 500 100 cells are examined table 1 presents the comparison of the lift and drag coefficients of the airfoil at α 14 and 17 between the above mentioned meshes at moving surface speed ratio of 3 and moving surface location of 0 45 the results seem to be close together for 400 80 and 500 100 cells therefore the mesh with 500 100 cells is chosen for the flow simulations 4 2 effects of moving surface on the flow field the moving surface mechanism injects an additional momentum into the boundary layer as a result it can overcome the adverse pressure gradient and reduce the region of the separated flow to address this issue a comparison is made between the baseline airfoil and three msbc airfoils at α 17 with speed ratios k 2 3 and 4 at moving surface location s 0 45 with regard to the streamlines around the airfoil the results of this comparison are shown in fig 6 a large separation region is observed on the upper surface of the baseline airfoil for the msbc cases as the speed ratio increases the separation region shrinks this leads to an increase in the lift coefficient and a decrease in the drag coefficient consequently the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil will be enhanced a close up view of the velocity vectors near the moving surface is also shown in fig 7 for the baseline airfoil a reverse flow is formed while for the msbc airfoil with k 2 the velocity vectors are aligned to the downstream fig 7 b also demonstrates that the velocity at the vicinity of the moving surface is strongly altered because of the high adverse pressure gradient at a turbulent flow with re 7 5 105 4 3 effects of moving surface on the mechanical performance in order to examine the effects of moving surface on the mechanical performance of the s908 airfoil a moving surface with 0 1 chord length and various speed ratios i e k 1 to 5 are used this surface is placed at six locations from s 0 01 to 0 55 chord length see fig 1 as mentioned above by injecting the additional momentum into the boundary layer using moving surface the flow separation is delayed on the other hand as the moving surface speed increases the power consumption requirement increases therefore it is necessary to apply an appropriate speed to the moving surface fig 8 shows the msbc effects on the mechanical performance η defined by eq 9 as a function of moving surface location for various speed ratios and five angles of attack including α 8 11 14 17 and 20 the performance of the baseline airfoil is also depicted in this figure as can be seen an increase in the angle of attack leads to a decrease in the performance of the baseline airfoil due to the increase in the drag force for the msbc airfoils at the leading edge zone s 0 15 and α 17 a slight improvement in the mechanical performance is observed because in this range of the angles of attack the flow separation occurs on a region near the trailing edge of the airfoil as shown in fig 6 therefore due to the energy losses along the boundary layer the momentum is not sufficiently transferred toward the trailing edge it can also be seen that the best performance is obtained at s 0 45 for α 17 at α 8 the performance of the baseline airfoil is 44 5 while at s 0 45 and k 1 the performance reaches the highest value of η 57 9 in fact the moving surface enhances the mechanical performance by 30 compared with the baseline airfoil at α 11 the baseline airfoil has a performance of η 44 5 the maximum mechanical performance is 53 5 which is achieved at s 0 45 and k 2 the performance improvement at this angle of attack is 62 at α 14 the performance of the baseline airfoil is 19 using a moving surface with s 0 45 and k 3 causes the airfoil performance to reach a maximum value of η 44 in other words the airfoil performance is enhanced by 131 compared with the baseline airfoil at α 14 at α 17 the value of η for the baseline airfoil is 13 8 the performances of the msbc airfoil at k 3 and 4 and s 0 45 are similar thus it is better to choose the moving surface with a lower speed the mechanical performance at k 3 is equal to 34 8 and the improvement is 152 at α 20 the results are fundamentally different the baseline performance is dramatically dropped to 2 2 at this angle the flow is separated from the leading edge of the airfoil as shown in fig 9 a consequently the entire upper surface of the airfoil is in the stall condition furthermore according to fig 8 e it is found that the moving surface increases the mechanical performance only at s 0 01 which is placed right on the leading edge the maximum mechanical performance obtained at α 20 is equal to η 21 fig 9 b and c show the flow field around the msbc airfoils at k 4 for s 0 01 and 0 45 respectively the moving surface at s 0 01 completely eliminates the leading edge stall however a trailing edge separation exists at s 0 45 the moving surface cannot control the stall phenomenon at α 5 the moving surface has no significant effect on the airfoil performance this is because the flow is not separated at this angle at α 28 the pressure gradient is very intense and consequently the moving surface does not have the ability to overcome it therefore at α 5 and 28 the moving surface is not used finally the highest performance at each angle of attack is extracted from fig 8 and the corresponding lift and drag coefficients along with the results of the baseline airfoil are shown in fig 10 a higher lift coefficient and a lower drag coefficient are achieved by the msbc airfoils compared with that of the baseline airfoil 4 4 performance analysis of three bladed hawt the results presented in the previous section were related to a single two dimensional airfoil while the flow around an offshore wind turbine is three dimensional so that the free stream velocity is perpendicular to the turbine plane furthermore an offshore wind turbine has a finite number of blades therefore the turbine performance is also a function of the flow crossing through the turbine blades the aim of this subsection is to study the effect of moving surface on the torque and power generation of a three bladed hawt see fig 11 and to explore the result of their comparison with the baseline turbine blade element momentum bem method is one of the approaches that is used for calculating the torque and power generated by wind turbines this method is a combination of two methods including disk actuator theory and blade element theory tahani et al 2017 in order to enhance the aerodynamic performance a twist angle is applied to the blade therefore the angle of attack is obtained as follows 10 α ϕ ψ where ϕ and ψ are the inflow and twist angle respectively as shown in fig 11 the inflow angle is defined as the angle between the rotor rotation plane and the relative wind speed as follows hansen 2015 11 ϕ t a n 1 1 a u 1 a r ω where ω is the angular velocity and a and a denote the axial and tangential induction factors respectively these factors are expressed as follows 12 a 1 4 q s i n 2 ϕ σ c n 1 13 a 1 4 q s i n ϕ c o s ϕ σ c t 1 where q is the prandtl s tip loss factor σ is the local solidity and c n and c t denote the normal and tangential force coefficients respectively which can be written as follows 14 q 2 π c o s 1 e x p b r r 2 r s i n ϕ 15 σ b c 2 π r 16 c n c l c o s ϕ c d s i n ϕ 17 c t c l s i n ϕ c d c o s ϕ where r and b are the blade radius and number of blades respectively the torque generated by the turbine is calculated as follows 18 m ρ b u 2 ω 2 1 a 1 a s i n ϕ c o s ϕ c c t r d r by multiplying the torque by the angular velocity the total power of the rotor is obtained finally by subtracting the power consumption by the moving surface from the total power the net power coefficient is computed as follows 19 c p 8 λ 2 q λ r 3 a 1 a 1 c d c l c o t φ d λ r 1 π r 2 c c p c 1 λ r 3 2 d r where λ rω u is the tip speed ratio tsr and λ r rω u is the local tip speed ratio in order to use the bem method the blade is divided into sections in the present study eight sections for the blade are used the blade root is located at r r 0 2 and the radius of the blade is equal to 17 m table 2 presents the geometrical parameters of the blade the bem method needs an iterative process at each tsr and each section that can be summarized as follows 1 make an initial guess for the axial and tangential induction factors a and a 2 calculate the inflow angle ϕ employing eq 11 3 calculate the angle of attack α by eq 10 4 calculate the normal and tangential force coefficients c n and c t at the desired angle of attack using eqs 16 and 17 5 compute a and a using eqs 12 and 13 6 if a and a have not converged go to 2 7 compute the torque and power coefficient of the turbine rotor the calculations for the baseline blade and the msbc blade under the optimum conditions according to fig 10 are performed at a range of tsr between 4 and 9 fig 12 shows the results of the comparison between the baseline and msbc turbine in respects of the torque at low tip speed ratios the turbine torque is dramatically enhanced this is due to the fact that as the speed ratio decreases the angle of attack increases as mentioned in the previous subsection at higher angles of attack up to α 25 the aerodynamic performance of the msbc airfoils is better therefore the turbine performance is highly improved at lower tip speed ratios the maximum torque generated by the msbc turbine is 19 45 which is achieved at λ 4 5 while for the baseline turbine the maximum torque is 13 25 at λ 6 5 fig 13 depicts the power coefficient of the offshore wind turbine as a function of tsr for the baseline and msbc turbines a comparison with the result of qblade software is also presented in this figure the qblade software calculates the offshore wind turbines performance using a flow solver method along with the bem theory generally an acceptable agreement is observed between the present result and qblade data at low tsrs corresponded to the higher angles of attack there are some differences between the results due to the existence of long separation bubble in the flow field in fact the software uses a simpler turbulence model that cannot accurately predict the long separation bubbles while the turbulence model used in the present solver accurately predicts the separation bubbles see ref salimipour 2019 moreover the comparison between the baseline and msbc turbines indicates that because of the moving surface at lower tip speed ratios the turbine has a higher power coefficient than that of the baseline turbine therefore it is possible to use a low tsr turbine while a significant power can be extracted this is important in terms of safety as well as the durability of offshore wind turbine components the maximum power coefficient of the msbc turbine is 0 45 which is achieved at λ 7 while for the baseline turbine the maximum power coefficient is 0 4 at λ 7 7 it should be noted that the use of a moving surface is not only useful in reducing the stall occurrence but also at low angles of attack by increasing the momentum on the upper surface of the airfoil leads to enhancing the airfoil performance therefore for the higher tsrs the power coefficient also increases fig 14 shows the percent improvement of the msbc turbine relative to the baseline turbine as a function of tsr a considerable percent improvement in the turbine performance is observed at lower tip speed ratios at λ 4 the improvement is about 200 as the tip speed ratio increases the blade sections encounter with less stall conditions in fact the moving surface effects are reduced as a result the performance improvement extremely decreases so that for λ 4 it reaches to 35 and for λ 7 the improvement is about 10 at a certain tsr the angle of attack is different at each blade section however a wind turbine usually operates at a constant tsr therefore it is possible to adjust the location and speed of the moving surface for each section table 3 presents the best location and speed of the moving surface for each section at tsr 4 and 9 since each part of the blade needs a different moving surface the blade can be divided into several sections and for each section the appropriate moving surface can be placed as mentioned earlier a belt like surface with downstream motion performed by a pulley drive system can be used to move the surface the torque required to rotate the pulley may be provided by an electric motor 5 conclusions in the present study the flow around the s809 airfoil was numerically simulated with and without moving surface the simulation was carried out based on the numerical simulation of the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations at the reynolds number of 7 5 105 a moving surface with the length of 0 1c at the locations from 0 01 c to 0 55 c and the speed ratios between 1 and 5 was located on the upper surface of the airfoil the moving surface could decrease the separated flow region by injecting the additional momentum into the boundary layer this led to an increase in the lift coefficient and a decrease in the drag coefficient as a result the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil was improved the findings obtained from the present study for the turbine blade section s809 airfoil can be summarized as follows by using a moving surface with the appropriate speed and location the aerodynamic and mechanical performance of the airfoil was enhanced the best location of the moving surface for α 8 11 14 and 17 was at s 0 45 and for α 20 it was at s 0 01 at α 5 and α 28 the moving surface had no effect the improvements for the mechanical performance of the airfoil were 30 62 131 152 and 800 for α 8 11 14 17 and 20 respectively moreover the generated torque and power coefficient of a three bladed hawt for two cases of the baseline and msbc blades were obtained using the bem method for 4 λ 9 the moving surface significantly improved the turbine performance especially at low tsrs the maximum torque generated by the msbc turbine was 19 45 at λ 4 5 while for the baseline turbine the maximum torque was 13 25 at λ 6 5 the percent improvement of the msbc turbine relative to the baseline turbine was 200 at λ 4 and 10 at λ 9 for future investigations a parametric study on the length and number of the moving surfaces at different reynolds numbers can be suggested appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this article multimedia component 1

22248,in the current study tip vortex flows are numerically studied by employing large eddy simulation wet flow cavitation inception and cavitating tip vortex simulations are carried out on an elliptical foil the mesh resolution requirements for tip vortex prediction are evaluated by employing different mesh resolutions two different les models implicit les and localized dynamic kinematic model are utilized to model the sub grid scale viscosity and its impacts on the tip vortex prediction for the wet flow vortex properties are computed for each resolution and compared with experimental data comparisons show that at least 16 cells per vortex radius is required to predict the tip vortex in the near field region employed numerical approach is fully capable of capturing the accelerated axial velocity at the vortex core and shows good agreement with the experimental observations the analysis of bubble dynamics shows that tip vortex inception strongly depends on the initial bubble radius especially where the radius is smaller than 50 μ m the predicted azimuthal velocity the diameter of the cavitating tip vortex and the velocity flow fields are compared with experimental measurements the comparisons show that the current numerical approach can provide accurate prediction of tip vortex flows also in cavitating conditions keywords tip vortex cavitation simulation inception elliptical foil 1 introduction as the flow passes over a lifting wing with finite span a pressure differential exists between the upper and lower surfaces of the wing close to the wing tip this pressure differential drives the fluid from the high pressure side on the lower surface to the low pressure side on the upper surface this makes the flow highly three dimensional at the tip region and creates a vortex pattern as this vortex is transported downstream it rolls up more and more of the wing wake until its circulation becomes nominally equal to that of the wing this typically extends to a few chord lengths downstream of the trailing edge called the near field region after this region and when the roll up is finished the vortex will start to decay due to the flow viscosity instability and also bursting arndt et al 1991 maines and arndt 1997b souders and platzer 1981 tip vortex flows are known to be challenging flows to study because of the presence of anisotropic turbulence and the large gradients of pressure and velocity in all three directions especially across the vortex core the evolution of the strength and size of a tip vortex along its path is a complex phenomenon governed by both viscous diffusion and the capture of vortex lines modelling and prediction of the minimum pressure coefficient is difficult especially in the vicinity of the wing where the tip vortex is far from being axisymmetric boulon et al 1999 franc and michel 2004 brennen 1995 due to the swirling nature of the vortex the pressure in the vortex core is lower than in the surrounding therefore in the cavitating case cavitation inception would occur in the vortex core the tip vortex cavitation inception complicates the flow physics even further as it depends on additional flow parameters such as nuclei distribution residence time and turbulence fluctuation which are very difficult to control during experimental tests as well as in numerical simulations ligneul and latorre 1993 hsiao and chahine 2005 park et al 2009 shen and dimotakis 1989 tip vortex characteristics of a propeller has a direct impact on the propeller tip vortex cavitation inception which is important in defining the boundaries of the cavitation bucket chart of a propeller kuiper 1981 correctly predicting the cavitation behaviour of the propeller as a function of loading conditions is crucial in balancing difficult constraints in demanding design tasks the co existence of phase change and tip vortex creates a complex flow structure in the tip region of propellers which involves very small scale dynamics both in time and space understanding the physics of these flows is important in finding the tip vortex inception speed in order to prevent or control the occurrence of cavitation on propellers bensow and bark 2010 vesting et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 experimental tests on propellers can provide very useful information about the vortex properties and the tip vortex cavitation inception however despite the huge cost which has to be spent for each test as the tip vortex involves small scales of flow dynamics it is very difficult to measure all the relevant flow features e g velocity distribution another drawback is the disability of the current tools to measure the pressure at the vortex core where cavitation inception occurs numerical simulations can be used to give further insights on the tip vortex properties that experimental tests may not be able to provide schot et al 2014 asnaghi et al 2017b a the simplest numerical approach to determine the cavitation inception number σ i is the minimum pressure criterion in this method the operating condition when the lowest pressure value of a wet flow falls below the saturation pressure is called the inception point considering the fact that cavitation inception is essentially a wet flow problem the advantage of the method is its simplicity as it only requires the pressure field of the wet flow simulation to determine the inception point as the method does not include the nuclei contribution on the inception prediction the method usually leads to an overprediction of σ i the methods that include the nuclei effects and model bubble dynamics behaviours in order to determine the inception point can be classified into three different groups according to the level of the complexity kim et al 2014 the most advanced approach considers the coupling between bubbles and the flow field the bubbles are injected upstream and tracked downstream as two way coupling is considered the bubbles motion size and distribution affect the velocity and pressure field for each of the bubbles a separate rayleigh plesset r p equation is solved at each time step to obtain the bubble radius the momentum equation is solved along with r p equation to determine the bubble path the second category so called uncoupled approach only includes the effects of the fluid on the bubbles and it is assumed that the effects of the bubbles on the flow field is negligible the uncoupled assumption reduces the computational requirements in the third model a single spherical bubble filled with vapour and gas is assumed to travel through the minimum pressure area then the r p equation is solved for this bubble by considering the surrounding pressure field to determine the cavitation inception point in this work simulations and analysis are conducted on the tip vortex flow on an elliptical foil the arndt elliptical foil arndt 1995 2002 in order to determine the possibility of using cfd to support advanced propeller design work the vortex structures around this type of foil resembles the propeller tip vortex behaviour while making it possible to be tested in more details both experimentally and numerically the tip vortex at the selected operating conditions is relatively stationary which reduces the computational requirements pennings et al 2015a pennings 2016 the current paper contains both wet and cavitating tip vortex flow analysis the wet flow analysis includes the investigations of numerical settings and modelling e g importance of spatial mesh resolution and turbulence modelling the objective of the mesh dependency study is to find the computational mesh requirement to predict the tip vortex in the near field region for tip vortex cavitation inception experiments show that cavitation begins at a short distance downstream of the wing within one chord length at most and that the roll up process is already significantly initiated at such a relatively short distance franc and michel 2004 berntsen et al 2001 therefore the focus in the current research is to predict the development and spread of the tip vortex 1 5 chord lengths downstream the foil this investigation contains the mesh variation in both streamwise and inplane directions by employing hexahedral dominant cells generated by starccm along with the spatial resolution of the vortex in one case the contribution of the spatial resolution of the wake in roll up process is also analysed the capability of the numerical analysis to rank different operating conditions is also evaluated by analysing the foil at three different angles of attack aoa moreover in order to evaluate the effects of sub grid scale modelling on the tip vortex prediction two different les models are employed implicit les iles model and localized dynamic kinematic model ldkm for each of these studies the vortex properties including the vortex trajectory vortex axial velocity at the vortex core velocity distributions at different inplane section downstream of the foil and the pressure distribution are computed and compared with the available experimental data as one of the objectives of the current research was to develop a post processing tool to determine the cavitation inception point the minimum pressure criterion and a single bubble dynamics analysis are considered as the cavitation inception methods for single bubble dynamics the coupling between the bubble and the flow field is one way where the velocity and pressure fields are kept fixed and it is assumed that the bubble travels along the tip vortex trajectory then effects of the vortex core pressure and velocity on the growth or collapse of the bubble are investigated to find the cavitation inception point the results are compared with experimental measurements in both weak and strong water along with the experimental curve fitted data to provide more insights regarding the effects of nuclei distribution and size in the tip vortex cavitation inception the cavitating tip vortex is analysed utilizing an eulerian transport based model where the flow is modelled as a single fluid mixture considering incompressible phases for both liquid and vapour a source term model for the mass transfer between the phases is applied sauer and schnerr 2000 sauer 2000 yuan et al 2001 this approach has been used by the authors successfully in prediction cavitating flows where different cavitation regimes present simultaneously asnaghi et al 2015 2017c four different operating conditions are simulated and compared with experimental data the simulations are again carried out on different mesh resolutions to clarify the effects of the spatial resolution in predicting the cavitating tip vortex the study indicates that at least 16 computational cells are required for iles across the vortex radius in order to be able to predict the tip vortex in the near field region the streamwise mesh requirement is less around half of the inplane resolution requirement for the elliptical foil both of the turbulence models iles and ldkm predict the tip vortex in a good agreement with the experimental measurements and no significant difference is found between their results the findings also clarifies the capability of the numerical approach in ranking different operating conditions the comparison between azimuthal velocity measurements and numerical predictions show that the methodology can predict the challenging cavitating tip vortex physics very well we continue the paper by presenting a thorough literature survey on the cavitating tip vortex then the governing equations elliptical foil geometry computational domain and mesh specifications are presented the results of the wet flow simulations includes mesh resolution investigations effect of wake resolution subgrid scale modelling effects and capability in ranking operating conditions then the results of cavitation inception are presented for both the minimum pressure criterion and the r p model finally numerical prediction of cavitating tip vortex at different operating conditions are presented and compared with experimental measurements 2 literature survey the physics of tip vortex cavitation tvc involves simultaneous presence of small flow structures and phase change since controlling tip vortex cavitation tvc is vital for low noise propellers intensive efforts have been conducted both experimentally and numerically to understand the effective physics perspectives of this flow this section summarizes the current physical understanding of tvc and effective flow parameters on that the survey is categorized into three parts in the first part the experimental investigations and consequent understandings of tip vortex physic are addressed as prevention or minimization of tvc is the main criteria in low noise propellers designs the second part briefly describes developed methods in tvc mitigation aiming to emphasize the corresponding flow or geometry characteristics on tvc in the last part numerical simulations of tvc flows are investigated and effects of different numerical strategies and especially different turbulence closure models on the tip vortex prediction are highlighted 2 1 tip vortex fundamental features the experimental measurements of tvc on a naca 6 6 2 415 cross section by higuchi et al 1989 revealed that tip vortex cavitation inception tvci was either the sudden appearance of a continuous cavity or the intermittent appearance of an elongated bubble extending axially over a relatively small portion of the tip vortex at this intermittent step noise intensity is significantly larger than the fully developed tvc noise intensity the parameter determining the inception type of a tip vortex is the nuclei capture behaviour cavitation would occur in the core of a tip vortex only if a nucleus has enough time to reach the core and then trigger cavitation boulon et al 1997 it is well reported that this behaviour of a tip vortex depends on the nuclei radius initial location and the vortex circulation arndt and keller 1992 ligneul and latorre 1993 briançon marjollet and merle 1997 it is also noted by hsu 1991 that the vortex velocity contributes to the nuclei capture behaviour in some of the experimental measurements the effects of nuclei on tvci have been addressed in the context of weak water no tensile strength and strong water rupture considerably below vapour pressure while the water quality and nuclei distribution has little effect on the propeller sheet cavitation inception bubble cavitation and tvc were found to be very sensitive to the nuclei distributions considering inception of different types of cavitation on a propeller gindroz and billet 1998 showed that the maximum reduction in cavitation index with increased water tension was 76 for bubble cavitation 59 for tip vortex cavitation and 3 for sheet cavitation mørch 2009 reviewed the nuclei effects on the cavitation inception and also described different models for cavitation nuclei the dependency of water tensile stress on the initial bubble conditions e g radius and gas content has also been discussed and a model to represent this dependency is proposed this model explains why the tensile strength of water can range from zero to hundreds of bar and it links cavitation nuclei at solid surfaces to free gas bubbles the tvci and its formation also correlates on flow reynolds number and the blade geometry arndt and keller 1992 fruman et al 1995a in this correlation or scaling law as the lift coefficient depends on the reynolds number i e c l f re the dependency of tvci on reynolds number can be replaced by its dependency on the lift coefficient measurements of appearance of vortex singing on elliptical foils with three different cross sections maines and arndt 1997b showed vortex boundary layer interactions are strongly coupled to the separation characteristics of each foil cross section and lift coefficient for an elliptical foil with naca 6 6 2 415 cross section the relation is σ i 0 068 c l 2 re 0 4 in the relation the effects of flow unsteadiness and water quality are suppressed it is also noted that with a sufficiently large supply of nuclei inception occurs close to the tip of the hydrofoil bubble growth in the radial direction is rapidly stabilized at a radius that is somewhat smaller than the viscous core bubble growth continues in the axial direction at a rate proportional to the free stream velocity and the square root of the tension sustained before inception arndt and maines 2000 arndt 2002 reported that the flow unsteadiness especially the pressure field at the vortex core increase the cavitation inception it is noted that the core pressure can be highly unsteady up to 1 8 p m 1 2 ρ u 2 it was demonstrated that while in weak water the cavitation inception number is related to c l 2 in strong water the relation is c l 1 4 arndt 2006 amromin 2006 considered boundary layer separation caused by tip vortices in scaling the tip vortex cavitation inception shen et al 2009 show that the power of exponential relation for scaling tip vortex cavitation inception also depends on the ratio of reynolds numbers between model scale and full scales lee et al 2012 conducted tip vortex cavitation inception tests in both full and model scale propellers in order to define the scaling exponent they estimated the scaling exponent to be around 0 30 they reported that this value also provides appropriate correlations between model and full scale noise measurements zhang et al 2015 reviewed the scaling law for the determination of the tvc inception they highlighted that it is necessary to conduct further high resolution measurements and numerical calculations of tip vortex flows in order to provide more knowledge of this complex flow physics variation of the free stream turbulence levels and the blade surface roughness properties affect the boundary layer properties developed on the propeller the experimental measurements of korkut and atlar 2002 showed that the method of altering the free stream turbulence has a similar effect on the cavitation inception as the leading edge roughness technique suggesting the opportunity to employ the modern method of altering the free stream turbulence instead of using the cumbersome leading edge roughness technique by conducting a series of experimental tests on a tip vortex at high reynolds numbers stinebring et al 1991 concluded that the vortex flow field is highly three dimensional near the hydrofoil in the region of cavitation inception where further downstream the flow approaches symmetry about the vortex axis the unsymmetrical axial flow around a vortex core close to the tip is reported also by ryo 2009 it is noted that this structure can increase turbulent fluctuations around the vortex core arndt et al 1991 highlighted the importance of these fluctuations on the vortex core pressure fluctuations and the inception later murayama et al 2006 observed that unsteady behaviour of the pressure across the tip vortex influences the circulation of the tip vortex core and therefore affects the growth and the decay of the unsteady tip vortex cavitation the magnitude of the core axial flow fluctuations is also reported to be as much as 120 of the free stream velocity garmann and visbal 2017 interactions between laminar shear layer separation flow reattached property and generation of tip vortices are found to be responsible in determining the wake or jetlike behaviour of the core axial velocity genç et al 2016 it is reported by hu et al 2015 that the incipient cavity has substantial effect on the local flow field and makes the vortex structures unsteady by measuring the distribution of the strain rate and reynolds shear stresses in the tip vortex region giuni 2013 reported that at the centre of the vortex with the distance from the trailing edge an initial increase of the turbulence was observed in cases with high radial gradients of the axial velocity and low mixing of fluid however it is observed that this process was only temporary and a partial or complete relaminarization of the vortex core happened throughout the experiments depending on the radial gradient of the axial velocity and the initial turbulence level within the core as the hydrodynamically optimum propeller design may not have optimum hydroacoustic performance sezen et al 2016 it is necessary to also consider the vortex core properties and their contributions on the singing frequency of the cavitating tip vortex maines and arndt 1997a the range of the sound frequency band generated by a propeller cavitating tip vortex strongly correlates with the size of the tip vortex cavity for larger cavities the range shifts to lower frequencies pennings et al 2015c it is noted that the mean cavity size in the undisturbed section of the flow and the cavity size downstream of the wake plates can be the main contributor for the broadband sound centre frequency pennings et al 2016 the study of dynamics and noise emission of vortex cavitation bubbles by choi and ceccio 2007 showed that the noise level produced by nuclei expansion depends on the initial nuclei size where rapid rate of volume acceleration of small bubble produces an audible pulse conversely larger nuclei would begin to grow as soon as they were exposed to any tension resulting in a reduced rate of volume acceleration they also reported that the impulse produced upon collapse was typically four to five orders of magnitude larger compared to the growth and splitting noise peng et al 2015 experimentally investigated vortex singing in tvc they reported that the tones of vortex singing are very different under different flow conditions and water qualities it is also noted that the vortex singing can only exist in the transferring process between strong tip vortex cavitation and weak tip vortex cavitation also reported in peng et al 2017 park and seong 2017 investigated the effects of number of generated bubbles tvc event rate on the tvc noise scaling law by conducting experimental tests on two scaled naca 4412 elliptic hydrofoils visual and acoustic techniques was used to count the numbers of generated bubbles the blade load distribution can also contribute to tip vortex cavitation formation kuiper 2001 at highly loaded tip vorticity is generated at the trailing edge of a propeller blade resulting in a trailing vortex formation at low tip loading separation still occurs close to the tip while the trailing vortex is much weaker leading to a typical local tip vortex formation an unloaded tip forces the loading towards inner radii and at these inner radii leading edge separation and therefore a leading edge vortex may be formed in this manner effects of non uniform flow field pereira et al 2016 and blade surface roughness dreyer 2015 felli and falchi 2011 should also be considered as multiple concentrated vortices are often produced in the wake of lifting surfaces it is necessary to analyse the vortex interactions and their contributions on tip vortex cavitation inception for the case of co rotating vortices inception occurs in the region of vortex combination in the interaction of nonequivalent counter rotating vortices the weaker vortex can wrap around the stronger vortex causing the weaker vortex to be stretched choi et al 2003 showed that this stretching process can lead to cavitation inception by visualization of cavitating co rotating tip vortices chang et al 2007 confirm the vorticity bridging during the merger of vortices they also note that the vapour surface of the merging vortices is irregular indicating significant small wavelength vortex unsteadiness of the merging vortices examination of the inferred core pressure of the primary and secondary vortices before the onset of any instability suggests that the primary vortex would incept first since the core pressure of the primary vortex is lower than that of the weaker secondary vortex chang et al 2012 however they observed that in the majority of cases where the instability was present the secondary vortex incepted first often well before reaching pressures low enough for the primary vortex to incept as the reduction in the core radius of the secondary vortex alone is not sufficient to produce the tension needed to incept small nuclei and to explain the location of inception or the observed size and dynamics of the elongated bubbles they postulated that the stretched and turned secondary vortex also produces axial jetting in its core which would further reduce the pressure the inception point can be determined either through visual observations of cavitation appearance e g cavitation volume or tip vortex diameter savio et al 2009 or through acoustic measurements of the noise levels and then signal analysis of bubble bursting lee et al 2013 employed short time fourier transform stft and the detection of envelope modulation on noise demon spectrum methods in signal analysis of bubble bursting to determine the tip vortex cavitation inception they noted that considering the results of stft and demon together would provide a more accurate tool in predicting inception point kim et al 2015 employed a broadband source localization algorithm to postprocess their experimental noise measurements in order to find the tip vortex cavitation inception point comparison with visual inspection revealed that the localization algorithm successfully localized the incipient tvc earlier than the visual inspection the study of song et al 2017 on the tip vortex cavitation inception of an elliptical hydrofoil with a naca 6 6 2 415 section showed that when tvc approaches desinence the sound pressure level will slowly climb up to a local peak and then descends dramatically which is the tvc inception point they also confirm that tvc inception for the low nuclei seeding conditions occurs much earlier than the non nuclei seeding conditions and further increasing the nuclei seeding does not affect the tvc inception any more lee and seo 2013 the observations also proved that initial amount of air present in the system has a crucial impact on the stability properties of the system and therefore on the cavitation inception fuster et al 2014 where in the weak water the inception point is close to the minimum pressure criterion yang et al 2014 measurements of the tip vortex flow field provide further insights about the flow features the current study employs the measurements conducted at delft university of technology by pennings 2016 pennings et al 2015b they applied the stereoscopic particle image velocimetry piv technique to measure the flow field of a tip vortex in presence as well as in the absence of cavitation around the arndt elliptical foil during the tests the uncertainty of the inlet velocity 0 5 and the outlet pressure 0 05 were measured and reported dissolved oxygen do was used as a representative parameter of non condensable gas during the tests determined by using an optical sensor in the cavitating tip vortex condition the vapour core of vortex cavitation was not seeded and therefore the velocity was measured only outside the tip vortex cavity the tip vortex characteristics have been measured at different operating conditions in both cavitating and non cavitating conditions the effects of foil angles of attack reynolds number inlet velocity and dissolved gas concentration on tip vortex flows are measured the foil forces vortex wandering vortex velocity distributions at different section downstream of the foil cavity diameter emitted noise and cavity resonance frequency are reported for each condition pennings 2016 sum of correlation soc was used to postprocess the piv images in order to remove the effects of the vortex core wandering the measurements show that the non cavitating tip vortex has a radius around 1 mm and also accelerated axial velocity at the vortex core the diameter of the tip vortex cavity is determined by two approaches the maximum gradient of cavity shadow and proctor vortex model fit they have also proposed an analytical model for the dispersion relation of disturbances on an infinite cavitating vortex which is matched to the experimental data pennings et al 2015a 2 2 tip vortex mitigation the marine industry generally seeks only to increase the tip vortex core pressure to alleviate cavitation and to do so a few approaches are proposed and tested these approaches generally can be classified into two groups in the first group which is called active control the tip vortex flow is altered by injection of a solution e g air polymer or water in the second group either the propeller geometry is modified or its surface roughness the early study of fruman and aflalo 1989 showed that injecting a polymer solution lowers the tvc inception number the tests also revealed that polymer injection increased the tip vortex radius as well as reduced the tip vortex tangential velocity it was concluded that the increase in the tip vortex radius is responsible for the delay in cavitation inception mccormick 1962 showed that roughening the blade pressure side would also lead to tip vortex radius increase and therefore delay in tvc inception contradictory to these findings shima and tsujino 1994 indicate that polymer injection would lower water surface tension and as a result would cause tvc inception at higher cavitation numbers chahine et al 1993 tested a model propeller with polymer injection they observed up to 35 delay in tvc inception by injecting some combinations of polymer solutions they also reported that the location of the injection port was extremely important where the optimum injection port location appears to be on the suction side of the blade at the tip vortex attachment point with injection directly into the core they did not observe any significant improvement in tvc inception delay by injections of pure water or a 50 water glycerin viscous mixture later latorre et al 2004 theoretically investigated the effects of polymer presence on the cavitating tip vortex delay they reported that the influence of polymer is to increase the tip vortex core radius and delay the inception of tip vortex cavitation it is also shown that polymer injection only reduces the surface tension of small bubbles radius lower than 15 μ m which do not play significant role in cavitation inception ryo 2009 investigated the effects of the polymer injection on the tip vortex unsteadiness the unsteadiness of the flow near the hydrofoil tip caused by either vortex vortex interaction or a shear flow between a uniform velocity and vortex core velocity contributes to tvc inception mechanism this unsteadiness causes coherent fragmentation of vorticity and introduces a low pressure which can govern tvc inception yakushiji hypothesized that the elasticity of the polymer solution may suppress this fragmentation of vorticity and finally result in a higher static pressure the measurements of fruman et al 1995b also clarified that the root mean square of the tangential velocity at the vortex core is lower in the presence of the injected polymer they also showed that polymer injection does not significantly alter the distribution of the tip vortex intensity along its path and therefore the roll up of the vortex chang et al 2011 examined the tip vortex cavitation inception suppression of an elliptic hydrofoil by injection of water and polymer solution and confirmed that relatively low fluxes of mass injection in the tvc roll up region led to a substantial decrease in flow unsteadiness in the core region near the observed location of inception and this corresponded to a substantial decrease in the inception pressure rivetti et al 2014 employed air injection to mitigate the cavitating tip vortex on a kaplan turbine scale model they reported that the level of vibration and its amplitude decrease proportionally with air flow rate injected it is also reported that at the expense of a maximum efficiency drop of 0 2 air injection induces a decrease on the level of vibration from 57 up to 84 rivetti et al 2016 park et al 2014 proposed a semiactive control scheme to suppress the cavitating tip vortex on a model scale propeller by attaching a flexible thread on the tip of the blade due to low pressure region at the tip vortex core the thread would be sucked into the tip vortex three different thread materials were tested steel nylon and dyneema where only the dyneema thread was sufficiently flexible to be sucked into the tip vortex core they reported that when the thread is sucked into the vortex it can effectively suppress the tip vortex cavitation inception boulon et al 1999 investigated effects of confinement on tip vortex cavitation of an elliptical hydrofoil where the confinement is achieved by flat plates set perpendicular to the span at an adjustable distance from the tip the minimum pressure at the vortex core is decreased at the presence of confinement leading to early cavitation inception this trend essentially results from a potential effect in their study no viscous effects connected to the interaction between the tip vortex and the boundary layer which develops on the confinement wall have been observed to affect the onset of tip vortex cavitation gim and lee 2013 investigated effects of an end plate on the tip vortex formation of naca 0018 foil during their experimental measurements different angles of attack were analysed it was reported that the endplate significantly stabilizes the reynolds shear stress and reduces the tip vortex causing the prevention of vibration and cavitation the roll up wake flow at the span end of the foil is also decreased due to the endplate shin and andersen 2015 investigated the cavitating tip vortex flows of tip modified propellers they showed that reducing the blade tip loading as an effort to restrain sheet and tip vortex cavitation in the design of marine propellers can cause cloud cavitation responsible for much of noise and surface erosion brown et al 2015 investigated interactions of tip vortices downstream of a tip loaded propeller tlp having a winglet in tlp designs a winglet prevents the formation of a single strong tip vortex and instead two distinct weaker vortices were generated they noted that although rans analyses captured the formation of two tip vortices they were not able to compute the evolution of the tip vortices or provide any insight into the vortex merging process it is also noted that the separation of the two vortices has the effect of delaying the cavitation inception it is expected that the separation between the two vortices will depend on a number of factors some of those being the span of the endplate and the loading distribution of the endplate the blade surface roughness also contributes to the tip vortex properties johnsson and ruttgerson 1991 studied the influence of leading edge roughness on the tip vortex roll up for different angles of attack it is shown that application of roughness on the pressure side near the leading edge has a delaying effect on tip vortex cavitation and leads to a substantial reduction in tip vortex strength they also reported that applying the roughness can reduce the open water efficiency by 2 later it was suggested to apply roughness only on a small area of the blade suction side close to the tip trailing edge region the turbulence generated by the roughness can destabilize the tip vortex and lead to its early breakdown by employing particle image velocimetry measurements ghimire and bailey 2017 investigated the effect of the free stream turbulence on the vortex decay by increasing the free stream turbulence level they showed that the rate of vortex peak tangential velocity decay increases while the rate of core radius increase remains unchanged kruger et al 2016 reported that suction sided sand grain roughness reduces the tip vortex strength and leads to pressure increase in the vortex core souders and platzer 1981 discussed that the thicker turbulent boundary layer on the wing tip results in an increased tip vortex core radius and a decrease in the tip vortex maximum tangential velocity as compared to the laminar flow case they investigated this hypotheses by applying roughness on the tip region of a hydrofoil and considered its contributions on the tip vortex characteristics in order to avoid substantial increases in drag the roughness was applied only to those areas of the foil tip whose streamlines contributed directly to the formation of the tip vortex they reported an increase of tvc inception speed by 41 for pressure side roughness 28 for suction side roughness and 67 for pressure and suction side roughness the recent study of asnaghi et al 2019a showed the necessity of optimization of roughness area for an elliptical foil it is reported that having rough foil leads to drag increase of about 85 while the optimized roughness area drag increase is 1 7 they tested different roughness patterns and concluded that for the suction side tip vortex condition the optimum area to apply the roughness is the leading edge and trailing edge of the suction side the tvci improvement was reported to be around 33 in the optimized roughness pattern later they tested the methodology to optimize the roughness area in a model scale asnaghi et al 2019b it is reported that for the model scale propeller having a suction side tip vortex the tvci was improved by 26 while the efficiency decrease was less than 2 2 3 numerical simulation before the development of computational resources classical vortex flow fields were used to describe vortex properties as an example one can mention the study of arakeri et al 1988 where a modified lamb vortex model was employed to determine the minimum pressure coefficient in a fully rolled up tip vortex later it was also tried to include the viscosity effects on the extension of lamb queen vortex formula in order to define the tip vortex flow structure cavity size and cavity resonance frequency bosschers 2009 an analytical formula has also been proposed to describe the cavitating tip vortex flow based on the non cavitating tip vortex properties the formula represents the circumferential velocity pressure and vorticity distributions at the cavitating vortex core yamada et al 2015 developed a method to predict the radiated noise from propeller tip vortex cavitation by substituting a rankine combined vortex instead of the tip vortex then r p equation is solved inside the rankine combined vortex to find the growth of a cavitation bubble for preliminary cavitation checks in the propeller design phase a panel method seems to be the most suitable tool as the radial extent and the angular range of cavitation occurrence are predicted with acceptable accuracy shin et al 2015 wang et al 2016 however due to the incapability to model the cavitating tip vortex for the later design stages more accurate and detailed propeller performance predictions are required nowadays by taking advantage of high performance computing cfd has provided more detailed knowledge and insights about tip vortex flows implementation of cfd however in such complex flow features demands specific attentions where the outcome can be significantly altered by inappropriate selection of numerical settings it is now clear that the accuracy of tip vortex simulations depends on the numerical diffusion level and also turbulence modelling computational resolution grid quality and numerical schemes determine the numerical diffusion level as the roll up process and vortex formation involve very small scale flow structures with very high gradients and due to the high swirling nature of a vortex inappropriate selection of turbulence closure would easily lead to the overprediction of turbulent viscosity and therefore underprediction of the vortex strength in advanced cfd simulations and due to small scales of tip vortex dynamics compared to the foil or blade geometry providing appropriate resolution with sufficient number of grid points is vital some of the grid related errors come from the skewness and non orthogonality of grid lines and grid points that are not properly distributed windt and bosschers 2015 improper distribution of the grid points affects the accuracy of numerical schemes and can result in underresolving i e artificially diffusing the high gradients in the flow if numerical diffusion arising from the grid related errors and truncation errors becomes significant in comparison to that of the physical diffusion the computed vortex will be distorted there have been several studies to find the spatial resolution requirements by considering an analytical vortex dacles mariani et al 1999 found that an average of 15 20 grid points in each of the crosswise and spanwise directions in the viscous core of the tip vortex region are needed to adequately resolve the flow they also determined that the vortex is more sensitive to cross flow plane grid refinement than streamwise refinement further it was noted that third order convection scheme is too dissipative to correctly transport the vortex and at least 5th order convection schemes have to be employed later also reported by nichols 2008 duraisamy 2005 also employed 5th order accurate schemes and showed that at least 10 grid points are needed across the vortex core egolf et al 2000 reported that by using 9th order accurate convection schemes the mesh requirement across the vortex core is 7 grid points ahmad et al 2013 showed that for second order accurate solver the mesh requirement is almost twice 30 40 grid points across the vortex core the study of su et al 2013 showed that at the tip region the designed order of accuracy of the numerical scheme is seldom guaranteed and the low quality of grid points leads to more numerical dissipation than expected it was clarified by qiu et al 2010 2013 that the accuracy of the results were sensitive to the quality of the computational cells in terms of values of jacobian volume and skew angles the summary of the required grid points to predict tip vortex flows is presented in table 1 joubarne et al 2011 employed adaptation operations to modify an existing mesh in order to simulate the tip vortex flow around an elliptical naca16020 hydrofoil they compared two types of meshes hybrid meshes composed of tetrahedrons and prisms and hexahedron meshes they noted that an adapted hexahedron mesh is the best choice for computing fluid properties as far downstream as possible while close to the foil hybrid meshes can resolve the tip vortex more accurately an important difference between the two kinds of meshes is related to node distribution in the hybrid meshes the nodes are concentrated close to the profile whereas in the hexahedron mesh the nodes are more evenly distributed in the downstream region windt and bosschers windt and bosschers 2015 compared two different mesh generation strategies in predicting the tip vortex flow one is a priori mesh refinement inside a tube with a helix shaped centre line at the tip vortex region and the other is the adaptive mesh refinement using the jump based estimator they observed that as the vortex for the propeller is weaker than for the wing and the viscous core is smaller the results are extremely grid dependent in the local mesh refinement strategy it is also reported that the grid resolution at the tip does not contribute to the trust and torque predictions as they are affected by the mesh resolution on the blade it is also noted by yu et al 2017 that the shedding of the tip vortex cavitation around a skew propeller cannot be captured clearly when the grid in the trailing region of the blade tip is insufficiently detailed thereby affecting the accuracy of the tip vortex cavitation it is generally accepted that the accuracy of cfd prediction of the cavitating tip vortex flow depends strongly on the grid structure hence only the grids constructed especially for vortex dominated flows should be used together with turbulence models especially suited for modelling of such flows for turbulence closure dacles mariani et al 1999 evaluated one equation turbulence models of baldwin barth and spalart allmaras sa along with the modified production terms to simulate the tip vortex flows they also concluded that incorporating the modifications into the turbulence models gave some improvements in the prediction of the viscous vortex core but it was not fully successful in resolving tip vortex flows flaszyński et al 2009 applied the sa turbulence model to simulate the tip vortex of a propeller like hydrofoil and showed that the sa model does not allow to obtain the proper vortex structure even close to the blade suggesting that the differences appears already at the vortex origin schot et al 2014 employed the sa model along with a curvature correction to simulate the tip vortex flow around an elliptical foil tested by pennings 2016 they observed that the model is not capable to predict the accelerated flow in the tip vortex core it is also noted that although modelling the transition of the boundary layer affects the vortex viscous core size a result of the turbulent viscosity rolling up in the vortex core the turbulent modelling will alter this in the shear layer trailing the wing and will damp it during the roll up into the vortex core liang and xue 2014 showed that while the sa model underpredicts the streamwise vorticity in the tip vortex core by 40 employing des sa could capture the complicated three dimensional structures of the tip vortex more accurately on the same mesh resolution and with similar computational cost gaggero et al 2014 conducted experimental observation and numerical study of the tip for conventional and ducted propellers tip leakage vortex two layer realizable k ϵ model in conjunction with the schnerr sauer cavitation model was used to predict the cavitating tip vortex although the numerical results generally were satisfactory they observed that for instance all the cavitating vortex instabilities experimentally observed for the conventional and the ducted propellers were completely missed by the numerical computations zhang et al 2017 employed a filter based model to simulate tip leakage vortex cavitation flows the comparison of the results with rng k ϵ results show significant improvement in predicting small flow structures and better tip vortex prediction by using the filter based approach smirnov and menter 2009 extended the application of spalart shur correction spalart and shur 1997 into the sst k ω model their study showed that for confined cases i e u bend channel and flow in a cyclone employing curvature correction improves the vortex prediction however for tip vortex simulations around naca0012 including curvature correction does not improve the tip vortex flow prediction especially the prediction of the accelerated axial velocity at the vortex core hellsten 1997 proposed a curvature correction for sst k ω model based on the local richardson number in this approach the destruction term in the ω equation is modified and sensitized to the system rotation and streamline curvature asnaghi et al 2016 2017a employed sst k ω turbulence model to simulate tip vortex flow around the arndt foil they reported that even by employing curvature correction the turbulence modelling fails in predicting the accelerated axial flow at the vortex core also reported by hong and dong 2010 khatami et al 2015 ghadimi et al 2017 it is reported that the curvature correction could predict the location of the vortex core but the correction is not suitable to improve the tip vortex prediction dymarski et al 2008 compared different rans models and concluded that reynolds stress model rsm can provide more accurate results compared to one equation and two equation models wells 2009 compared rsm with sa model having curvature correction and reported that the rsm is the only model to appropriately predict a true minimum turbulent kinetic energy at the vortex centre o regan et al 2014 employed rsm to simulate the tip vortex flow around a naca0012 foil in the near field region at two different angles of attack 5 and 10 experimental measurements show that the axial velocity is accelerated in α 10 while it is decelerated at α 5 the numerical simulations were not able to predict this accelerated axial velocity they noted that the large difference observed in numerical and experimental crossflow velocity is most likely responsible for the corresponding discrepancy in axial velocity sipilä and siikonen 2012 employed rans to study cavitating tip vortex flows of the potsdam propeller test case pptc and noted that the cavitating tip vortex simulation is not very sensitive to the mass transfer rate it is also found and reported in sipilä et al 2014 that turbulence models gave significant differences to the tip vortex core solutions in wet and cavitating conditions significant differences are also found in pressure prediction at the wake region between different rans models where explicit algebraic reynolds model earsm showed slightly lower pressure at the vortex core than the results of two equation rans models viitanen and siikonen 2017 compared different turbulence models in predicting cavitating flows around the pptc in their study low reynolds number k ϵ model sst k ω sst model with an explicit algebraic reynolds stress model and also a ddes approach based on the sst k ω were evaluated differences between the tested turbulence closures in predicting global propeller performance were not considerable although the best correspondence was obtained with the k ϵ model the tip vortex was generally underpredicted wang et al 2015 compared standard and non linear k ϵ models in predicting the tip vortex flow over a rounded wingtip naca0012 foil and reported that the spatial phase shift between the mean strain rate and reynolds stresses can be more accurately modelled by the nonlinear k ϵ turbulence model liu et al 2016 compared standard and non linear k ϵ in predicting cavitating tip vortex flows over a naca0015 foil as well as the insean e779a propeller they highlighted the advantages of the nonlinear model to include the rotation rate in the constitutive relationship between the strain and the reynolds stress which implies that the correction of the rotating flow is important in the tip vortex simulation the summary of literature survey on rans models in predicting tip vortex flows is presented in table 2 uzun et al 2006 employed iles along with the overset grids to model tip vortex flow of a rounded tip naca0012 they found that the initial condition differences between numerical simulations and experimental test conditions can lead to considerable discrepancy between the numerical results and experimental measurements later in uzun and hussaini 2010 they compared the dynamic mixed model and dynamic smagorinsky model with iles in prediction of tip vortex flows and showed that the best agreement with the experiment was obtained by the iles by iles simulation of wing tip vortex flow jiang et al 2008 showed that the turbulence inside the primary tip vortex is not created by the tip vortex itself instead the turbulent shear layer and the interaction between the primary and the secondary vortices are the major sources of turbulent activity in the core decaix et al 2015a b compared the localized dynamic smagorinsky les model with sst k ω and showed that the mean behaviour of the tip vortex is well captured by both rans and les but the dynamics of the tip vortex was damped out in rans simulations as high order numerical schemes and grid resolution requirements for vortex simulation are computationally costly some methods are developed to compensate the numerical dissipation in vortex flows e g the vorticity confinement model zhang et al 2014 employed a vorticity confinement method along with rans to simulate a propeller tip vortex they obtained an accurate prediction of the tip vortex in the near field region although they observed vorticity confinement had some effects on the calculated vortex strength o regan et al 2016 employed the vorticity confinement model to simulate wing tip vortex flows in the near field region along with urans and les the focus was on preventing the rapid dissipation of vorticity in a wing tip vortex they examined different mesh resolutions where the finest had 13 cells across the vortex core it is noted that urans could not predict the accelerated vortex core axial velocity at high angles of attack they also show that urans quickly diminishes the turbulence downstream of the wing with velocity fluctuation orders of magnitude less than the experimental data it is also shown that les and the vorticity confinement method can predict different characteristics of the vortex quite well other methods such as the variational multiscale method bensow and larson 2010 can be employed to counteract the excessive numerical dissipation in order to preserve vortices in numerical flow simulations from a cfd perspective a few attempts have been conducted to develop the tip vortex inception criteria as a post processing tool one can mention minimum pressure criterion and low pressure volume method in this method the cavitation inception number is considered to be equal to minus of the minimum pressure coefficient c p in another method the volume occupied by the pressure lower than the saturation pressure is considered yvin and muller 2016 conducted numerical simulations on the pptc propeller studying inception based on the low pressure volume method and as the inception data were available the minimum volume occupied by the lowest pressures which leads to cavitation inception was identified there have been a couple of studies including the dynamics of bubbles from the lagrangian point of view into the tip vortex flow formation which is the eulerian framework this approach becomes important in the tip vortex inception condition where the dynamics of bubbles and their interactions with tip vortex properties define the inception in this approach the bubble dynamics is governed by the r p equation hsiao and chahine 2004 2005 employed this approach to simulate the acoustic pressure generated by cavitation inception in a tip vortex flow over an elliptical foil considering the scale effects they noted that at larger scales more bubbles incept per unit time the main reason is that at the larger scales the nuclei capture area and the size of the vortex core are increased it is noted that predicted cavitation inception number depends on the nuclei size distributions where at higher nuclei sizes the predicted cavitation inception numbers tends to c p this implies that scaling effects due to nuclei size distribution are stronger when the water contains only small nuclei later hsiao et al 2015 developed a multiscale two phase flow eulerian lagrangian approach to include tracking of micro bubbles in the micro scale along with capturing large cavities at the macro scale the model was employed to simulate cavitating flows around a propeller where different cavitation regimes appears simultaneously they also considered the nucleation from the rigid boundaries in addition to bubble nuclei dispersed in the liquid in their model park et al 2009 employed eulerian lagrangian approach along with rans turbulence modelling in their study rans is coupled with the dissipation vortex model for the efficient eulerian flow field analysis then the nuclei trajectories are calculated considering various forces acting on the nuclei finally calculated radius variation of the cavitation bubble and the trajectory are used as the input of cavitation bubble noise analysis abdel maksoud et al 2010 reported that within the region having pressure lower than the saturation pressure where the nuclei experience the growth the trajectory of the bubble would be dependent on the considered forces acting on the bubble they highlighted that only the use of detailed equations of motion correctly describes the bubble trajectories independent from the fluid paths in vortex flows where pressure changes crosswise to streamlines choi and chahine 2004 2007 compared spherical and non spherical bubble assumption in predicting the tip vortex cavitation and related collapse pressure pulses they show that the collapse pressure pulse predicted by non spherical elongated bubbles is much higher than the one predicted by the spherical bubble assumption which corresponds to the pressure peaks measured during the experiments at the moment of the bubble splitting as the non spherical behaviour becomes important only below the cavitation inception no difference reported for cavitation inception prediction by spherical and non spherical models by simulating vortex cavitation bubbles choi et al 2009 noted that large nuclei with near zero critical tension will grow in a quasi steady manner while small nuclei which require larger tension to incept can grow explosively when the critical tension is reached ni et al 2012 applied one way particle tracking method ptm and the boundary element method bem to simulate trajectory and deformation of bubbles in tip vortex flows in the first step of their simulations and before the bubble being captured the bubble dynamics equation is solved to predict trajectory and volume oscillation of the bubble the second step is after the bubble is captured in which the final conditions of the first stage are taken as the input and the bubble motion such as growth elongation or splitting can be simulated by solving the non spherical bubble model with the bem 3 governing equations 3 1 conservation equations using the low pass filtering approach the conservation equations of

les turbulence modelling most turbulent flows consist of vortex filaments and sheets with characteristic scales of the orders between the taylor and kolmogorov scales l t and l k respectively typically being orders of magnitude smaller than the reference length of the flow l ref the following relations are used to estimate these turbulent length scales where the reference length of the flow is assumed to be equal to the foil root chord length davidson 2013 5 l t 10 l k 2 3 l ref 1 3 6 l k ν 3 ϵ ave 0 25 where 7 ϵ ave u ref 3 l ref in these equations ϵ ave is the dissipation rate per unit mass and ν is the kinematic viscosity the taylor micro scale is an intermediate length scale at which fluid viscosity significantly affects the dynamics of turbulent eddies in the flow in dns all flow scales down to l k are resolved making such simulations too expensive for engineering applications instead les in which all the flow scales smaller than l t are modelled thus having weaker resolution requirements have emerged as a viable alternative for engineering predictions rans on the other hand is dependent on the characteristics of the mean flow which in general implies lower resolution requirements compared with les in this paper two different strategies are considered to model the les subgrid stress tensor implicit les iles and localized dynamic kinematic subgrid stress model ldkm as an explicit model in iles no explicit model is applied for b i j instead the numerical dissipation is considered enough to mimic the action of b i j fureby 2006 rider 2006a bensow and bark 2010 asnaghi 2015 therefore for the momentum convection term a scheme that can provide iles results should be used rider 2006b in ldkm the subgrid scale stress is defined as 8 b i j 2 3 ρ k sgs δ

the pressure field of the tip vortex the cavitation index definition is employed 13 σ p p sat 1 2 ρ u ref 2 where p s a t is the saturation pressure 3 3 cavitation modelling 3 3 1 cavitation inception this section introduces two concepts that are later used when assessing cavitation inception in the tip vortex the minimum pressure criterion and the rayleigh plesset equation the application of these in the estimation of cavitation inception is discussed further at section 7 2 1 in the minimum pressure criterion the cavitation inception point is determined as 14 σ i c p min where c p min is the minimum pressure coefficient one can also use a curve fitting approach to provide the dependency of the tip vortex cavitation inception on the reynolds number foil geometry and nuclei distribution for an elliptical foil in weak water arndt 1995 suggested the following formula 15 σ i 0 068 c l 2 r e 0 4 the rayleigh plesset r p equation which governs the dynamics of a single spherical bubble is 16 r d 2 r d t 2 3 2 d r d t 2 4 ν l r d r d t 2 s ρ l r p b t p t ρ l where r is the radius of the bubble ν l is the kinematic viscosity of the liquid s is the liquid surface tension ρ l is the liquid density p b t is the bubble inside pressure and p t is the pressure at the far field the summation of the vapour pressure p v and the dissolved gas pressure p g defines the bubble inside pressure 17 p b t p v t p g t at equilibrium condition the r p equation reduces to 18 p b p 2 s r therefore at the initial condition and by equilibrium condition assumption the dissolved gas pressure can be obtained as follows 19 p g0 p 0 2 s r 0 p v by ideal gas assumption for the bubble dissolved gas content the dissolved gas pressure at any time can be derived from 20 p g p g0 r 0 r t γ where γ is equal to one for isothermal bubble expansion considering that p b t is known and p t is given the time varying bubble radius can be calculated from the r p equation eq 16 3 3 2 mass transfer modelling transport equation model tem is employed to model the two phase flow in this approach both the vapour and liquid phases are treated as incompressible and the volume fraction is used to specify the distribution of each phase the mixture flow properties are calculated based on the homogeneous mixture assumption 21 ρ m α l ρ l 1 α l ρ v μ m α l μ l 1 α l μ v this two phase mixture assumption as compared with a two fluid modelling is well in line with the filtering in les small bubbles that are not possible to resolve are seen as a mixture through the les filter this will hold also for larger bubbles unless the grid is aligned with the interface which is not a computationally reasonable approach for complex flows bensow and bark 2010 in order to model the mass transfer between phases a source term is added to the right hand side of the liquid volume fraction transport equation 22 α l t α l u i x i m ρ l in the current study the schnerr sauer model is used to compute the mass transfer between the phases 23 m c sign p p threshold α l 1 α l α nuc r b 3 ρ l ρ v ρ m 2 p p threshold 3 ρ l where c c c c v is applied to adjust and calibrate the mass transfer rate in this equation p threshold is the pressure level where mass transfer occurs and α nuc is the averaged volume fraction of the nuclei in order to avoid manual adjustment of the mass transfer coefficient the coefficient of the original model are modified based on the velocity strain rate time scale and the mean flow time scale the condensation coefficient c c allows for some retardation in the condensation wikstrom et al 2003 therefore a constant condensation coefficient c c 1 is used and the coefficient modification is employed for the evaporation coefficient 24 c v 1 t ref 1 2 u i x j u j x i the time scale of the mean flow t ref l ref u ref is also employed to normalize the velocity strain rate value further information regarding the concepts and results of this modification can be found in asnaghi et al 2017c the average nuclei per liquid volume is considered constant and equal to n 0 1 0 8 and the initial nuclei diameter is d nuc 1 0 6 m in the current study the values of α nuc and r b are defined by 25 α nuc π n 0 d nuc 3 6 1 π n 0 d nuc 3 6 26 r b 3 4 π n 0 1 α nuc α l α l 3 in order to take into account the effects of viscous shear stresses on the liquid rupturing and phase change the threshold pressure is modified based on the magnitude of the shear strain rate joseph 1998 asnaghi et al 2017c 2014 the pressure threshold which determines the onset of cavitation in the flowing fluid is presented as follows 27 p threshold μ γ p sat p a p sat 28 γ 2 d i j d i j this added pressure p a μ γ is important if either shear strain rate or effective viscosity is large and comparable with the saturation pressure 4 case description the tip vortex flow around arndt elliptical foil is selected as a test case in order to gain insight about the flow pattern operating conditions and tip vortex properties as well as the requirements for numerical simulation of this type of the flow the geometry of the foil is an elliptical planform having the naca 6 6 2 415 cross section having naca 6 series section introduces a low adverse pressure gradient over the foil and therefore longer laminar boundary layer the foil is often used for experiments and analysis of vortex cavitation the foil has been tested at different institutes in various operating conditions both in wet and cavitating conditions arndt et al 1991 arndt and keller 1992 pennings et al 2015b schot et al 2014 in the current study the experimental study conducted in the cavitation tunnel in the laboratory for ship hydrodynamics at delft technical university pennings et al 2015b schot et al 2014 is selected for comparison with the numerical results the computational domain mimics the cavitation tunnel dimensions where the inlet is placed approximately four chord lengths in front of the foil and the outlet is placed ten chord lengths behind the foil fig 1 the trailing edge of the tested foil was truncated at a thickness of 0 3 mm due to manufacturing limitations where the root chord length after truncation is c 0 0 1256 m the total projected area of the foil obtained from the 3d cad model is 0 01465 m 2 which is used as the reference area to compute non dimensional parameters e g lift coefficient the foil has a half span of 150 mm summarized in table 3 so that the tip is positioned in the centre of the test section the foil is also placed in the middle of the channel width where distance to each side is equal to 150 mm pennings et al 2015b the simulations are conducted at the inlet velocity of 6 8 m s which corresponds to the reynolds number of 8 95 1 0 5 presented in table 4 three different angles of attack 9 7 and 5 are considered to evaluate the operating conditions impact on the tip vortex properties 5 spatial mesh description as the vortex roll up and transport involve very small scales of the flow structures and physics even very small amount of numerical diffusion will damp these scales and therefore will lead to incorrect prediction of vortex properties therefore one of the most important challenges of numerical analysis of tip vortex flows is to provide appropriate mesh resolution at the vortex core region in order to systematically investigate the spatial resolution requirement for numerical analysis of the tip vortex employing hexahedral cells at the tip vortex region is considered to address this starccm of siemens plc is used to generate the mesh in the first step a coarse mesh without refinement of the tip vortex region is generated the flow is simulated to find an approximate tip vortex trajectory the trajectory path is then exported into starccm to define a priori refinement zones two cylindrical regions are considered around the trajectory path to specify the mesh resolution having 10 mm for inner refinement cylinder irc and 60 mm for outer refinement cylinder orc diameters respectively as the objective is to investigate the mesh requirement for vortex prediction in the near field region these cylindrical refinement regions are extended 1 5 chord length downstream of the foil in fig 2 cell distribution in the streamwise and inplane sections are presented the boundary layer in all of the resolutions are fully resolved in the wall normal direction y 1 20 prismatic layers having extrusion factor of 1 15 are used to provide appropriate boundary layer resolution around the foil the baseline mesh resolution on the foil follows x z 250 which fulfils the requirement for a wall resolved les simulations however in the relevant tip region the refinement regions also affect the surface resolution and even finer mesh density is achieved in this region to investigate the inplane and streamwise mesh requirement five different resolutions are created the surface resolution and prismatic layers y 1 of these meshes are the same and the only difference between them is the resolution of the inner refinement cylinder fig 2 in table 5 the specifications of these meshes are presented it is reported that the tip vortex core of the selected operating condition has a diameter around 1 mm therefore the sizes and dimensions in table 5 are selected accordingly to provide a certain number of cells in the streamwise and inplane directions for the coarsest resolution p1s1 a streamwise resolution finer than taylor length scale l t 4 1 0 4 m is selected the inplane resolution is selected as half of the taylor length scale in order to provide at least 8 cells in the vortex core then two more meshes are created with the same streamwise resolution but finer inplane resolution p2s1 and p3s1 for streamwise mesh resolution study p2s1 is selected as the base resolution and is refined in the streamwise direction to obtain p2s2 and p2s3 meshes in order to investigate effects of foil wake on the vortex roll up the mesh resolution of p2s2 is also refined in the wing wake region so called p2s2 wake fig 2 c it should be noted that the inner refinement cylinder also covers the tip surface of the foil therefore the surface resolution at that region follows the inner refinement cylinder resolution 6 numerical settings the openfoam package used in this study for numerical simulation is an open source code written in c to model and simulate fluid dynamics and continuum mechanics it is possible to employ the code and build new functionalities libraries solvers and utilities the software is community driven where various communities are working on different fields of applications in openfoam the spatial discretization is performed using a cell centred collocated finite volume fv method for unstructured meshes with arbitrary cell shapes and a multi step scheme is used for the time derivatives to complete the fv discretization the face fluxes need to be reconstructed from grid variables at adjacent cells requiring interpolation of the convective fluxes and difference approximations for the inner derivatives of the diffusive fluxes see openfoam 2015 for more details on the discretization and the numerical schemes used in openfoam for unsteady simulations the pimple algorithm a merge of the simple and piso algorithms is used to solve the coupling between the velocity and pressure asnaghi 2015 the solver tolerances based on the residuals of pressure and velocity in each iteration is set equal to 10 7 for good convergence at each time step at least two outer loops are performed and in each loop at least two pressure correction loops are performed a second order implicit time scheme i e a three level backward scheme is used for time discretization with a fixed time step equal to 10 6 s which provides courant number lower than one for this flow condition in order to get the developed flow faster larger time steps are used at the beginning of simulations for the coarsest resolution simulations are started from the initial condition equal to the reference flow properties it is noted that the forces converge much faster than the time it takes for the tip vortex to develop therefore several pressure probes are considered along the tip vortex trajectory to check the development of the tip vortex and its convergence which usually takes up to 10 t ref defined in table 4 when the tip vortex is developed the time step gradually is reduced to the desired value i e 10 6 s then the data collecting and flow averaging are conducted for at least 0 1 s in each case which corresponds to 5 5 t ref the simulations of finer resolutions are stared from the flow field mapped from the coarser resolution having the same operating condition then the convergence check and data averaging procedure are repeated as describe earlier the computations are carried out on the hebbe hpc cluster of chalmers center for computational science and engineering c3se where each computational node contains 20 cpu cores and has 64 gb of ram for each simulations the number of nodes is selected in a way to roughly set 180 k cells per core for the p2s2 resolution this leads to a wall clock time of ca 8 s per time step considering the averaging period i e 0 1 s the simulation time to sample data for this resolution is around 10 days a second order upwinding scheme linearupwindv is employed to interpolate the face velocity values in iles for ldkm a less dissipative second order linear scheme limitedlinearv which is a tvd limited central differencing scheme is employed the other face properties are interpolated by a second order linear scheme all of the surface gradients have been corrected to consider non orthogonality of the computational cells the convective schemes used are in general considered to be too diffusive for les the choice of the schemes for this study was forced due to issues in grid generation the converted meshes from starccm to openfoam generally contain a few highly skewed faces and also show high non orthogonality between neighbouring cells these poor quality cells typically appear either on the interface of the prismatic boundary layer and the volumetric cells or at the interface of the refinement regions and volumetric cells the consequence is local stability issues and therefore enforcing a limitation in using more accurate schemes however in the flow regions of interest the mesh quality is very high with well aligned orthogonal hexahedron cells given the good agreement with experimental data we thus believe the numerics in the relevant regions are sufficiently good for the simulations presented in the paper some previous studies on the impact of the numerical schemes selection in openfoam is conducted and reported in asnaghi 2018 however a more thorough study on numerical schemes and their impact on the tip vortex prediction for a general flow remains for future work 7 results the vortex core properties e g the velocity and pressure are presented to evaluate the numerical results the experimental measurements include the streamwise i e axial and tangential i e in plane velocity components at the vortex core centre normalized by the inlet velocity pennings et al 2015b in order to identify the vortex core centre the minimum pressure is employed while it is assumed that the minimum pressure occurs in the centre of the vortex numerical analysis contains comparisons of the normalized axial velocity the cavitation index along the vortex core and vortex trajectories between different cases and conditions the cavitation index is computed according to the inlet velocity outlet pressure and the liquid density the vortex trajectory which represents the location of the vortex core centre along the streamwise direction z coordinate in the current study is normalized by the root chord length of the foil 7 1 wet flow 7 1 1 spatial mesh resolution dependency the first part of the results contains the effects of the spatial resolution on the vortex properties for each mesh resolution three different vortex properties are computed and compared vortex trajectory normalized streamwise velocity vortex core axial velocity and the cavitation index fig 3 presents the tip vortex properties at the vortex core for different inplane resolutions cavitation index is selected to represent the pressure field as the negative cavitation index indicates the regions where cavitation can be expected the cavitation index curves fig 3 a show that all of the selected inplane resolutions predict negative pressure at the region close to the tip z c 0 0 2 however the negative pressure predicted by p2s1 and p3s1 is almost twice the value predicted by p1s1 while the vortex core pressure of p1s1 becomes positive after z c 0 0 35 the other two resolutions predict negative pressure at the core until the end of the refined zones z c 0 1 6 the minimum pressure predicted by p2s1 and p3s1 are almost the same but the region of this minimum pressure is larger in p3s1 close to the end of the refinement region z c 0 1 5 all of the resolutions show sudden increase in the pressure the main reason of this sudden change is the impact of the coarse resolution outside the refined zone into the upstream region comparison of the vortex trajectories fig 3 b shows similar prediction by different inplane resolutions slight difference at the centre region 0 6 z c 0 1 0 is considered to be due to the foil wake flow roll up contributions into the tip vortex development all of the considered inplane resolutions are able to capture the accelerated axial velocity at the centre of the vortex fig 3 c the location of the maximum velocity corresponds to the location of the minimum pressure moreover while the maximum velocity predicted by p1s1 is almost 1 8 times larger than the inlet velocity p2s1 and p3s1 predict maximum velocity 2 2 times larger than the inlet velocity similar to the cavitation index prediction both p2s1 and p3s1 resolutions show similar trend in reduction of the velocity according to the comparisons presented in fig 3 inplane resolution p2 is selected as sufficient inplane resolution for tip vortex prediction fig 4 presents the results of streamwise mesh variations while inplane resolution is kept constant and equal to p2 resolution results show that the effects of the streamwise resolution on the tip vortex prediction is less than the inplane resolution this is related to the fact that the flow variations in the inplane section of the tip vortex due to the rotational nature of the vortex is larger than the variations in the streamwise direction the pressure distributions predicted by p2s1 p2s2 and p2s3 resolutions show similar trend even though the pressure predicted by p2s1 is slightly lower than the two other resolutions fig 4 a contradictory to the inplane resolution variation where increasing the inplane resolution lead to lower pressure at the vortex centre increasing the streamwise resolution leads to slightly higher pressure in the vortex core having higher streamwise resolution also leads to prediction of higher axial velocity fig 4 c this means that increasing the streamwise resolution leads to prediction of lower rotational velocity fig 5 a p2s1 resolution which has coarsest streamwise resolution shows more rapid decrease of the axial velocity especially after 0 8 z c 0 the maximum axial velocity predicted at the centre of the vortex by different streamwise resolutions are similar almost twice the inlet velocity similar contribution of coarse resolution outside the refinement region is also observed on the prediction of the pressure and velocity of the vortex core at 1 5 z c 0 according to the mesh resolution investigation p2s2 resolution is considered to be suitable to capture the physics of the vortex at reasonable computational cost in fig 5 b the normalized azimuthal velocity at the vortex core region at the section of z c 0 1 14 for p2s2 and p1s1 resolutions are plotted and compared with the experimental data pennings 2016 the results related to p2s2 show very good agreement with the experiment while p1s1 results show underprediction of the azimuthal velocity in figs 6 and 7 the velocity distributions at three different sections downstream of the foil are presented and compared with the experimental piv data the sections are z c 0 0 5 075 and 1 14 piv images are derived by employing sum of correlation soc conditional weighted averaging of experimental measurements see pennings et al 2015b for the effect this has on the results while the numerical results are time averaged therefore a small portion of the discrepancy between numerical results and experimental measurements are related to the difference in averaging methods it is however anticipated that the agreement would improve if the same averaging would have been used axial velocity distribution shows that the numerical approach can accurately predict the accelerated velocity at the centre of the vortex the vortex roll up which can be seen in the increase of the axial velocity between z c 0 0 5 and z c 0 0 75 is slightly under predicted in the numerical simulations one possible reason for this can be the coarse resolution in the wake region of the foil the results clearly show that employed numerical tool i e grid turbulence closure model and also the numerical schemes are well suited together to predict the tip vortex flow in the previous study of the authors asnaghi et al 2017a it is presented that the boundary layer development on the foil and specifically the boundary layer separation line prediction contributes significantly to the vortex core formations and its characteristics it was shown that even by employing the proper grid resolution sst k ω model fails in predicting the correct boundary layer on the wing and therefore the pressure field on it this wing pressure field difference between iles and sst k ω model causes different formations of tip vortex where in iles the flow is sucked into the tip core leading to correct prediction of accelerated core axial velocity this low pressure in the tip and leading edge regions where the vortex rolls up is presented in fig 8 a at the tip where the tip vortex forms the flow becomes highly 3 dimensional leading to high velocity gradients these high velocity gradients not only contribute to the high turbulent viscosity but also to high wall shear stresses and consequently the skin friction fig 8 b distributions of the friction coefficient at lower sections on the suction side are presented in fig 9 where in each section the distance from the leading edge normalized by the local chord length is used to calculate the local reynolds number re z ρ u inlet z μ c z in fig 9 the friction coefficient is presented at 3 different distances from the foil tip i e x s 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 the friction coefficient distributions over a flat plate at different conditions are included in the figure as well the flat plat data cover fully turbulent boundary layer fully laminar boundary layer and conditions with different pressure gradients or inlet turbulence intensities the coefficient distributions of the foil show four distinguishable regions the first region locates in 0 075 z c z 0 225 where the laminar boundary layer are destabilized showing lower destabilization impact at sections with further distance from the tip compared with the flat plat data having different pressure gradient conditions one can correlate this destabilization with having higher pressure gradients at sections closer to the foil tip the second region is located in 0 225 z c z 0 6 where the flow has become laminar the flow separates from the foil surface in the third region 0 6 z c z 0 7 leading to very low friction forces after 0 7 z c z the flow is separated and shed from the foil as trailing vortices these results have a very good agreement with the experimental oil flow visualizations conducted by maines and arndt 1997b where it is found that the separation bubbles are laminar their measurements indicate that the foil cross section at the considered operating condition develops a favourable pressure gradient to approximately 60 70 percent of the chord from the leading edge this favourable pressure gradient is believed to be responsible for the boundary layer re laminarization after 0 225 z c z in table 6 numerical prediction of lift coefficient is presented for different resolutions the results are also compared with the experimental data exp c l 0 67 and comparative errors are also included the relative error of the lift coefficient for the selected resolution p2s2 is 2 7 7 1 2 ranking operating conditions variations of angle of attack in order to evaluate the contribution of the operating conditions on the tip vortex properties and also validate the capability of the numerical setup on ranking different operating conditions three different aoas are considered 9 7 and 5 for each angle two different computational resolutions are created p1s1 which is the coarsest tested resolution and p2s2 which is found to be a sufficient resolution for tip vortex analysis of the current case the flow conditions i e inlet velocity and reynolds number are the same figs 10 and 11 show the variation of axial velocity and cavitation index at the vortex core for different aoas results indicate that for α 7 the vortex close to the foil is stronger than for the other two aoas while at α 9 the vortex roll up contributes more to the vortex formation slightly downstream and as a result the decay of the vortex is slower compared to of the other aoas further we remark that these plots also show that resolutions p1s1 and p2s2 predict different rankings of behaviour with operating conditions in table 7 numerical prediction of lift coefficients of each aoa are presented and compared with the experimental data for all of the tested angles increasing resolution from p1s1 to p2s2 will lead to better prediction of lift force however the accuracy of lift prediction decreases by decreasing foil aoa although the trend is exaggerated as the relative error is listed 7 1 3 wake resolution effects fig 12 shows the distribution of the instantaneous and averaged q fields for p2s2 and p2s2 wake resolutions in this figure the iso surface of pressure equal to saturation pressure is also plotted as a red surface to distinguish the location of the tip vortex the figure clearly shows that by employing a finer resolution at the wake region smaller structures of the flow are resolved resolving smaller scales in p2s2 wake leads to finer details in the q field further these small structures are rolled up into the tip vortex region and therefore strengthen the vortex comparison between pressure iso surfaces in fig 13 shows that in p2s2 wake the region with pressure lower than the saturation pressure is larger which represents the stronger tip vortex the q distributions on the foil however are very similar for p2s2 and p2s2 wake resolutions both of the resolutions show that separation of flow happens at around z c 0 0 6 more clearly seen in the flow streamlines of fig 13 note that in this figure the streamlines are computed based on an instantaneous velocity field and therefore represent the streamline tracing haeglad 2009 the distributions of vortex properties fig 14 a show that the pressure and axial velocity predicted by p2s2 wake resolution is lower than predictions of the p2s2 resolution the main reason for the presence of lower pressure in p2s2 wake can be correlated to the azimuthal velocity the comparisons of velocity distributions at z c 0 0 5 and 1 14 sections fig 15 show that in the p2s2 wake case the axial velocity is lower than the axial velocity of the p2s2 case however due to the contribution from roll up which is higher in p2s2 wake the azimuthal velocity becomes larger in p2s2 wake case leading to lower pressure at the vortex core for p2s2 wake case 7 1 4 comparison between iles and ldkm the comparison of vortex properties between the iles and ldkm results are presented in fig 16 the pressure prediction at the vortex core is similar for these two models except close to the foil z c 0 0 2 where ldkm shows lower pressure prediction close to the end of the refinement region z c 0 1 4 ldkm shows more sensitivity to the mesh size variation the contribution of the mesh size variation can also be observed at the vortex trajectory prediction at 0 4 z c 0 1 4 region it can also be observed that the decay rate of the accelerated velocity is higher in ldkm leading to lower axial velocity predictions by ldkm comparing to iles predictions no obvious difference is found between the q distributions of the ldkm and iles fig 17 both of the models show the boundary layer separates at the region around z c 0 0 6 similar structures are also found in the instantaneous and averaged q fields the tip zoomed view of q distribution clearly show that close to the tip the flow is dominated by very small structures and is fully three dimensional stinebring et al 1991 also observed similar tip vortex flow characteristics during their measurements in fig 18 the distribution of azimuthal velocity at the z c 0 1 14 is presented the comparison shows that both models have predicted the velocity distribution quite well the lift force however is predicted slightly better by ldkm table 8 the distribution of the sub grid turbulent kinetic energy at the vortex core region is presented in fig 19 the results show that the vortex core contains the highest turbulent kinetic energy similar to results reported by wells 2009 with rsm as the vortex core can be assumed laminar due to small fluctuations this high turbulent kinetic energy is believed to be related to the high turbulent production at the vortex core resulted from high velocity spatial gradients in this region 7 2 cavitating flow 7 2 1 cavitation inception as it is discussed in the literature survey the experimental assessment of cavitation inception is not straightforward and suffers from large uncertainties this comes from the complex dependency of the tvci on the reynolds number through the boundary layer development on blades shear layer vorticity interaction in the blade wake and primarily nuclei distribution and its interaction with the vortex region further there are technical difficulties in distinguishing the actual inception point as a result this makes validation of numerical predictions of inception points almost out of reach even though wet tip vortex flows can be predicted reasonably well by consideration of some simplifications however some methods are proposed to numerically predict inception points the minimum pressure criterion c p and r p bubble dynamics method are the most investigated approaches in this section numerical results of tip vortex cavitation inception of these methods are presented and compared the results are compared with the experimental data of an inception curve suggested by arndt 1995 eq 15 in the minimum pressure criterion the inception point can be obtained from the vortex core minimum pressure for bubble dynamics modelling variation of pressure over time exerted on a bubble passing through the vortex core trajectory is required the pressure and velocity distribution along the vortex core trajectory are presented in figs 3 and 14 considering the location and axial velocity of a particle travelling along the vortex trajectory the exerted pressure on the particle over time can be calculated fig 20 as the axial velocity predicted by p2s2wake resolution is higher at the vortex core it takes shorter time for a particle to travel through the vortex trajectory in the p2s2wake case for a single bubble dynamics investigations it is assumed that the bubble is at equilibrium condition with the surrounding before entering the vortex trajectory moreover the vortex core pressure is considered as the exerted pressure on the bubble the reaction of the bubble to the lower pressure region strongly depends on the initial gas content and also initial bubble radius as equilibrium condition is assumed for the bubble at initial condition the initial gas pressure and bubble pressure can be related via eq 19 therefore the only variable parameter is the initial bubble radius here different initial bubble radii are considered ranging from 1 μ m till 200 μ m for each initial bubble radius the r p equation is solved according to the exerted pressure to obtain the variation of the bubble radius over time the conditions that the bubble radius exceeds 5 mm is considered as an indicator of cavitation inception in fig 21 predicted cavitation inception numbers for different initial bubble radii are presented including the values achieved using the minimum pressure criterion the figure clearly shows the dependency of the predicted cavitation inception number on the initial bubble radius similar to the experimental measurements where the lack of nuclei delays the cavitation inception at lower bubble radius lower values are predicted for the cavitation inception number as expected by increasing the initial bubble radius the predicted cavitation inception number by the r p model approaches the value predicted by the minimum pressure criterion the minimum pressure criterion implicitly includes the assumption of homogeneous phase change proposing instantaneous mass transfer as the pressure falls below the saturation pressure bubbles with higher radii have lower response time to the surrounding pressure as a result larger bubbles response faster to low pressure field which is similar to the homogeneous mass transfer assumption in arndt and keller 1992 the tip vortex cavitation inception dependency on the water quality is investigated in the context of weak water no tensile strength and strong water rupture considerably below vapour pressure the weak water resembles the homogeneous assumption where there is no tensile strength for the strong water the estimated initial nuclei size responsible for the tensile strength was around 2 μ m from figure 12 of this reference and for lift coefficient similar to the current study c l 0 67 the interpolated values of cavitation inception for weak and strong water are 5 47 and 2 81 respectively comparing the weak water inception value 5 47 with c p values and also comparing the strong water inception value 2 81 with results of bubble radius 1 μ m of fig 21 clearly show that the current results are in very good agreement with the experimental measurements the dependency of cavitation inception prediction by the r p model suggests that for accurate tip vortex cavitation inception prediction it is necessary to determine the size of nuclei that can be sucked into the vortex core area and therefore accurate prediction of inception by the r p approach requires coupled bubble and flow simulations 7 2 2 eulerian two phase flow simulations the cavitating tip vortex simulations are conducted on p1s1 and p2s2wake resolutions at α 9 employing iles turbulence model in these simulations the outlet pressure is varied to match the corresponding cavitation number while the inlet velocity is kept fixed the simulated conditions cover different ranges of cavitation numbers including σ 4 2 2 6 1 7 and 1 2 in fig 22 the iso surfaces of vapour volume fraction α v 0 1 at different operating conditions are represented at the cavitation number of 4 2 cavitation appears only as a weak cavitating tip vortex cavitation as the pressure field is predicted more accurately in p2s2wake resolution than in the p1s1 resolution the cavitating tip vortex is longer and stronger in p2s2wake resolution by lowering the cavitation number the pressure at the tip vortex reduces further leading to stronger tip vortex cavitation at these conditions a thin leading edge cavitation also appears more visible at σ 1 2 while at σ 4 2 the discrepancy between p1s1 and p2s2wake is significant at σ 1 2 both resolutions show similar cavitation prediction where both of the resolutions were able to capture the cavitating tip vortex quit well until the end of the refinement region the reason is the contribution of the presence of vapour on the vortex core diameter in fig 23 the comparison of vortex radius at cavitating conditions between experimental measurements and numerical simulations is presented in this figure r c represents the vortex radius at cavitating condition determined by α v 0 1 and where r v 1 1 mm is the vortex radius at wet flow condition from the figure it can be observed that lowering the cavitation number leads to larger cavitating vortex radius r c r v at the cavitation number σ 1 2 the normalized cavitating vortex radius r c r v becomes equal to 2 3 according to the measurements it suggests that while at wet flow condition and for p1s1 resolution the vortex core diameter was covered by 16 computational cells at cavitating condition of σ 1 2 the vortex core contains almost twice the number of cells this number of cells per vortex core aligns well with the mesh dependency study where it is found at least 32 cells per vortex core diameter is required to correctly predict the tip vortex at the near field region it is concluded that mesh resolution requirements to model wet tip vortex flows are higher than the cavitating tip vortex in fig 24 the distributions of the azimuthal velocity at the section of z c 0 1 14 for different cavitation numbers are presented and compared with the experimental measurements from the experimental measurements it can be deduced that by lowering the cavitation number the vortex diameter increases and also the maximum value of azimuthal velocity decreases simulations conducted on p2s2wake resolution can predict the velocity distributions very well fig 24 b it can also follow the trend of velocity variations over different cavitation numbers the maximum value of the azimuthal velocity and also its location are well predicted for different cavitation numbers in p1s1 resolution fig 24 a the accuracy of velocity prediction improves by lowering the cavitation number at σ 4 2 as the spatial resolution is coarse the discrepancy between p1s1 prediction and experimental measurements are considerable the predicted velocity field at σ 4 2 and σ 2 6 are similarly suggesting very small contribution of the vapour presence on the flow field at this section z c 0 1 14 at lower cavitation number where the vortex diameter becomes larger the accuracy of the results improves 8 conclusion in this paper les studies of tip vortex flows around an elliptical foil are presented to investigate the requirements of numerical simulations for cavitation inception and cavitating tip vortex flows in the near field region numerical setup and conditions follow the experimental test conditions recently conducted by pennings at delft university of technology pennings 2016 the mesh dependency study clarifies that at least 32 grid points across the vortex core diameter are required to accurately predict the tip vortex with the current numerics the streamwise grid point demand is found to be lower with cell size equal to 16 grid points across the vortex core diameter as the streamwise gradients of the flow properties are lower compared to the inplane flow gradients as the openfoam package can be reasonably considered as a second order accurate numerical tool these findings are found to match with the previous reports on les analysis of tip vortex flows as the tip vortex formation and its roll up are mostly governed by the boundary layer on the tip of the foil which is covered by the mesh refinement regions further refinements of the spatial mesh on the wake of the foil is found not to have significant contributions on the tip vortex prediction comparisons of the velocity distributions between numerical results and experimental piv images show very good agreement it highlights the capability of the current approach in predicting the accelerated axial velocity at the vortex core and therefore good prediction of the pressure distribution which is very important in cavitation inception studies it also demonstrates that the suggested resolution is suitable for tip vortex analysis in the near field region which is the main concern in cavitation inception analysis simulations of different angles of attack show the numerical method employed here can predict the trend of the flow variation on different operating conditions and therefore is a proper tool for design purposes if the computational cost can be managed note however that a lower resolution than suggested here gives a different ranking between conditions the comparison of iles and ldkm results clarifies that both of these les models can provide very accurate tip vortex flow predictions the predicted velocity distributions at different sections downstream of the foil and pressure distribution and axial velocity along the tip vortex trajectory are compared and found to be very similar the ldkm results also predict very high turbulent kinetic energy at the vortex core even though the high value of turbulent kinetic energy in the vortex core has been reported also by experimental measurements it is believed that this high turbulent kinetic energy is related to the high turbulent production at the vortex core resulted from high velocity spatial gradients in this region the cavitation inception study by the bubble dynamic approach shows a strong dependency of the inception point on the nuclei size it is found that as the nuclei radius is increased the inception point tends towards the minimum pressure criterion which corresponds to the weak water measurements the prediction of the inception for small nuclei sizes i e 2 μ m has good agreement with the strong water measurements of inception the dependency of cavitation inception prediction by bubble dynamic approach on the nuclei size suggests that for accurate tip vortex cavitation inception prediction it is necessary to determine the size of nuclei that can be captured and sucked into the vortex core region and therefore accurate prediction of inception by r p approach would benefit from the coupled bubble and flow simulations mesh resolution requirements for cavitating tip vortex flows are clarified to be lower than wet tip vortex simulations it is found that presence of cavitation increases the tip vortex diameter consequently leading to lower grid points requirements the comparison of the predicted cavitating tip vortex diameter with the experimental measurements for a few conditions shows that the numerical approach can accurately predict the trend the numerical simulations also provide the velocity distribution inside the vortex cavity which was not possible to get during the experimental measurements due to the extra light exposure the numerical results presented in this paper clearly show the capability of the numerical approach in predicting tip vortex flow in both wet and cavitating conditions excellent agreements are found between the numerical predictions and the experimental measurements of the velocity field at different sections downstream of the foil also implying an accurate prediction of the pressure field the study also emphasizes

22248,in the current study tip vortex flows are numerically studied by employing large eddy simulation wet flow cavitation inception and cavitating tip vortex simulations are carried out on an elliptical foil the mesh resolution requirements for tip vortex prediction are evaluated by employing different mesh resolutions two different les models implicit les and localized dynamic kinematic model are utilized to model the sub grid scale viscosity and its impacts on the tip vortex prediction for the wet flow vortex properties are computed for each resolution and compared with experimental data comparisons show that at least 16 cells per vortex radius is required to predict the tip vortex in the near field region employed numerical approach is fully capable of capturing the accelerated axial velocity at the vortex core and shows good agreement with the experimental observations the analysis of bubble dynamics shows that tip vortex inception strongly depends on the initial bubble radius especially where the radius is smaller than 50 μ m the predicted azimuthal velocity the diameter of the cavitating tip vortex and the velocity flow fields are compared with experimental measurements the comparisons show that the current numerical approach can provide accurate prediction of tip vortex flows also in cavitating conditions keywords tip vortex cavitation simulation inception elliptical foil 1 introduction as the flow passes over a lifting wing with finite span a pressure differential exists between the upper and lower surfaces of the wing close to the wing tip this pressure differential drives the fluid from the high pressure side on the lower surface to the low pressure side on the upper surface this makes the flow highly three dimensional at the tip region and creates a vortex pattern as this vortex is transported downstream it rolls up more and more of the wing wake until its circulation becomes nominally equal to that of the wing this typically extends to a few chord lengths downstream of the trailing edge called the near field region after this region and when the roll up is finished the vortex will start to decay due to the flow viscosity instability and also bursting arndt et al 1991 maines and arndt 1997b souders and platzer 1981 tip vortex flows are known to be challenging flows to study because of the presence of anisotropic turbulence and the large gradients of pressure and velocity in all three directions especially across the vortex core the evolution of the strength and size of a tip vortex along its path is a complex phenomenon governed by both viscous diffusion and the capture of vortex lines modelling and prediction of the minimum pressure coefficient is difficult especially in the vicinity of the wing where the tip vortex is far from being axisymmetric boulon et al 1999 franc and michel 2004 brennen 1995 due to the swirling nature of the vortex the pressure in the vortex core is lower than in the surrounding therefore in the cavitating case cavitation inception would occur in the vortex core the tip vortex cavitation inception complicates the flow physics even further as it depends on additional flow parameters such as nuclei distribution residence time and turbulence fluctuation which are very difficult to control during experimental tests as well as in numerical simulations ligneul and latorre 1993 hsiao and chahine 2005 park et al 2009 shen and dimotakis 1989 tip vortex characteristics of a propeller has a direct impact on the propeller tip vortex cavitation inception which is important in defining the boundaries of the cavitation bucket chart of a propeller kuiper 1981 correctly predicting the cavitation behaviour of the propeller as a function of loading conditions is crucial in balancing difficult constraints in demanding design tasks the co existence of phase change and tip vortex creates a complex flow structure in the tip region of propellers which involves very small scale dynamics both in time and space understanding the physics of these flows is important in finding the tip vortex inception speed in order to prevent or control the occurrence of cavitation on propellers bensow and bark 2010 vesting et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 experimental tests on propellers can provide very useful information about the vortex properties and the tip vortex cavitation inception however despite the huge cost which has to be spent for each test as the tip vortex involves small scales of flow dynamics it is very difficult to measure all the relevant flow features e g velocity distribution another drawback is the disability of the current tools to measure the pressure at the vortex core where cavitation inception occurs numerical simulations can be used to give further insights on the tip vortex properties that experimental tests may not be able to provide schot et al 2014 asnaghi et al 2017b a the simplest numerical approach to determine the cavitation inception number σ i is the minimum pressure criterion in this method the operating condition when the lowest pressure value of a wet flow falls below the saturation pressure is called the inception point considering the fact that cavitation inception is essentially a wet flow problem the advantage of the method is its simplicity as it only requires the pressure field of the wet flow simulation to determine the inception point as the method does not include the nuclei contribution on the inception prediction the method usually leads to an overprediction of σ i the methods that include the nuclei effects and model bubble dynamics behaviours in order to determine the inception point can be classified into three different groups according to the level of the complexity kim et al 2014 the most advanced approach considers the coupling between bubbles and the flow field the bubbles are injected upstream and tracked downstream as two way coupling is considered the bubbles motion size and distribution affect the velocity and pressure field for each of the bubbles a separate rayleigh plesset r p equation is solved at each time step to obtain the bubble radius the momentum equation is solved along with r p equation to determine the bubble path the second category so called uncoupled approach only includes the effects of the fluid on the bubbles and it is assumed that the effects of the bubbles on the flow field is negligible the uncoupled assumption reduces the computational requirements in the third model a single spherical bubble filled with vapour and gas is assumed to travel through the minimum pressure area then the r p equation is solved for this bubble by considering the surrounding pressure field to determine the cavitation inception point in this work simulations and analysis are conducted on the tip vortex flow on an elliptical foil the arndt elliptical foil arndt 1995 2002 in order to determine the possibility of using cfd to support advanced propeller design work the vortex structures around this type of foil resembles the propeller tip vortex behaviour while making it possible to be tested in more details both experimentally and numerically the tip vortex at the selected operating conditions is relatively stationary which reduces the computational requirements pennings et al 2015a pennings 2016 the current paper contains both wet and cavitating tip vortex flow analysis the wet flow analysis includes the investigations of numerical settings and modelling e g importance of spatial mesh resolution and turbulence modelling the objective of the mesh dependency study is to find the computational mesh requirement to predict the tip vortex in the near field region for tip vortex cavitation inception experiments show that cavitation begins at a short distance downstream of the wing within one chord length at most and that the roll up process is already significantly initiated at such a relatively short distance franc and michel 2004 berntsen et al 2001 therefore the focus in the current research is to predict the development and spread of the tip vortex 1 5 chord lengths downstream the foil this investigation contains the mesh variation in both streamwise and inplane directions by employing hexahedral dominant cells generated by starccm along with the spatial resolution of the vortex in one case the contribution of the spatial resolution of the wake in roll up process is also analysed the capability of the numerical analysis to rank different operating conditions is also evaluated by analysing the foil at three different angles of attack aoa moreover in order to evaluate the effects of sub grid scale modelling on the tip vortex prediction two different les models are employed implicit les iles model and localized dynamic kinematic model ldkm for each of these studies the vortex properties including the vortex trajectory vortex axial velocity at the vortex core velocity distributions at different inplane section downstream of the foil and the pressure distribution are computed and compared with the available experimental data as one of the objectives of the current research was to develop a post processing tool to determine the cavitation inception point the minimum pressure criterion and a single bubble dynamics analysis are considered as the cavitation inception methods for single bubble dynamics the coupling between the bubble and the flow field is one way where the velocity and pressure fields are kept fixed and it is assumed that the bubble travels along the tip vortex trajectory then effects of the vortex core pressure and velocity on the growth or collapse of the bubble are investigated to find the cavitation inception point the results are compared with experimental measurements in both weak and strong water along with the experimental curve fitted data to provide more insights regarding the effects of nuclei distribution and size in the tip vortex cavitation inception the cavitating tip vortex is analysed utilizing an eulerian transport based model where the flow is modelled as a single fluid mixture considering incompressible phases for both liquid and vapour a source term model for the mass transfer between the phases is applied sauer and schnerr 2000 sauer 2000 yuan et al 2001 this approach has been used by the authors successfully in prediction cavitating flows where different cavitation regimes present simultaneously asnaghi et al 2015 2017c four different operating conditions are simulated and compared with experimental data the simulations are again carried out on different mesh resolutions to clarify the effects of the spatial resolution in predicting the cavitating tip vortex the study indicates that at least 16 computational cells are required for iles across the vortex radius in order to be able to predict the tip vortex in the near field region the streamwise mesh requirement is less around half of the inplane resolution requirement for the elliptical foil both of the turbulence models iles and ldkm predict the tip vortex in a good agreement with the experimental measurements and no significant difference is found between their results the findings also clarifies the capability of the numerical approach in ranking different operating conditions the comparison between azimuthal velocity measurements and numerical predictions show that the methodology can predict the challenging cavitating tip vortex physics very well we continue the paper by presenting a thorough literature survey on the cavitating tip vortex then the governing equations elliptical foil geometry computational domain and mesh specifications are presented the results of the wet flow simulations includes mesh resolution investigations effect of wake resolution subgrid scale modelling effects and capability in ranking operating conditions then the results of cavitation inception are presented for both the minimum pressure criterion and the r p model finally numerical prediction of cavitating tip vortex at different operating conditions are presented and compared with experimental measurements 2 literature survey the physics of tip vortex cavitation tvc involves simultaneous presence of small flow structures and phase change since controlling tip vortex cavitation tvc is vital for low noise propellers intensive efforts have been conducted both experimentally and numerically to understand the effective physics perspectives of this flow this section summarizes the current physical understanding of tvc and effective flow parameters on that the survey is categorized into three parts in the first part the experimental investigations and consequent understandings of tip vortex physic are addressed as prevention or minimization of tvc is the main criteria in low noise propellers designs the second part briefly describes developed methods in tvc mitigation aiming to emphasize the corresponding flow or geometry characteristics on tvc in the last part numerical simulations of tvc flows are investigated and effects of different numerical strategies and especially different turbulence closure models on the tip vortex prediction are highlighted 2 1 tip vortex fundamental features the experimental measurements of tvc on a naca 6 6 2 415 cross section by higuchi et al 1989 revealed that tip vortex cavitation inception tvci was either the sudden appearance of a continuous cavity or the intermittent appearance of an elongated bubble extending axially over a relatively small portion of the tip vortex at this intermittent step noise intensity is significantly larger than the fully developed tvc noise intensity the parameter determining the inception type of a tip vortex is the nuclei capture behaviour cavitation would occur in the core of a tip vortex only if a nucleus has enough time to reach the core and then trigger cavitation boulon et al 1997 it is well reported that this behaviour of a tip vortex depends on the nuclei radius initial location and the vortex circulation arndt and keller 1992 ligneul and latorre 1993 briançon marjollet and merle 1997 it is also noted by hsu 1991 that the vortex velocity contributes to the nuclei capture behaviour in some of the experimental measurements the effects of nuclei on tvci have been addressed in the context of weak water no tensile strength and strong water rupture considerably below vapour pressure while the water quality and nuclei distribution has little effect on the propeller sheet cavitation inception bubble cavitation and tvc were found to be very sensitive to the nuclei distributions considering inception of different types of cavitation on a propeller gindroz and billet 1998 showed that the maximum reduction in cavitation index with increased water tension was 76 for bubble cavitation 59 for tip vortex cavitation and 3 for sheet cavitation mørch 2009 reviewed the nuclei effects on the cavitation inception and also described different models for cavitation nuclei the dependency of water tensile stress on the initial bubble conditions e g radius and gas content has also been discussed and a model to represent this dependency is proposed this model explains why the tensile strength of water can range from zero to hundreds of bar and it links cavitation nuclei at solid surfaces to free gas bubbles the tvci and its formation also correlates on flow reynolds number and the blade geometry arndt and keller 1992 fruman et al 1995a in this correlation or scaling law as the lift coefficient depends on the reynolds number i e c l f re the dependency of tvci on reynolds number can be replaced by its dependency on the lift coefficient measurements of appearance of vortex singing on elliptical foils with three different cross sections maines and arndt 1997b showed vortex boundary layer interactions are strongly coupled to the separation characteristics of each foil cross section and lift coefficient for an elliptical foil with naca 6 6 2 415 cross section the relation is σ i 0 068 c l 2 re 0 4 in the relation the effects of flow unsteadiness and water quality are suppressed it is also noted that with a sufficiently large supply of nuclei inception occurs close to the tip of the hydrofoil bubble growth in the radial direction is rapidly stabilized at a radius that is somewhat smaller than the viscous core bubble growth continues in the axial direction at a rate proportional to the free stream velocity and the square root of the tension sustained before inception arndt and maines 2000 arndt 2002 reported that the flow unsteadiness especially the pressure field at the vortex core increase the cavitation inception it is noted that the core pressure can be highly unsteady up to 1 8 p m 1 2 ρ u 2 it was demonstrated that while in weak water the cavitation inception number is related to c l 2 in strong water the relation is c l 1 4 arndt 2006 amromin 2006 considered boundary layer separation caused by tip vortices in scaling the tip vortex cavitation inception shen et al 2009 show that the power of exponential relation for scaling tip vortex cavitation inception also depends on the ratio of reynolds numbers between model scale and full scales lee et al 2012 conducted tip vortex cavitation inception tests in both full and model scale propellers in order to define the scaling exponent they estimated the scaling exponent to be around 0 30 they reported that this value also provides appropriate correlations between model and full scale noise measurements zhang et al 2015 reviewed the scaling law for the determination of the tvc inception they highlighted that it is necessary to conduct further high resolution measurements and numerical calculations of tip vortex flows in order to provide more knowledge of this complex flow physics variation of the free stream turbulence levels and the blade surface roughness properties affect the boundary layer properties developed on the propeller the experimental measurements of korkut and atlar 2002 showed that the method of altering the free stream turbulence has a similar effect on the cavitation inception as the leading edge roughness technique suggesting the opportunity to employ the modern method of altering the free stream turbulence instead of using the cumbersome leading edge roughness technique by conducting a series of experimental tests on a tip vortex at high reynolds numbers stinebring et al 1991 concluded that the vortex flow field is highly three dimensional near the hydrofoil in the region of cavitation inception where further downstream the flow approaches symmetry about the vortex axis the unsymmetrical axial flow around a vortex core close to the tip is reported also by ryo 2009 it is noted that this structure can increase turbulent fluctuations around the vortex core arndt et al 1991 highlighted the importance of these fluctuations on the vortex core pressure fluctuations and the inception later murayama et al 2006 observed that unsteady behaviour of the pressure across the tip vortex influences the circulation of the tip vortex core and therefore affects the growth and the decay of the unsteady tip vortex cavitation the magnitude of the core axial flow fluctuations is also reported to be as much as 120 of the free stream velocity garmann and visbal 2017 interactions between laminar shear layer separation flow reattached property and generation of tip vortices are found to be responsible in determining the wake or jetlike behaviour of the core axial velocity genç et al 2016 it is reported by hu et al 2015 that the incipient cavity has substantial effect on the local flow field and makes the vortex structures unsteady by measuring the distribution of the strain rate and reynolds shear stresses in the tip vortex region giuni 2013 reported that at the centre of the vortex with the distance from the trailing edge an initial increase of the turbulence was observed in cases with high radial gradients of the axial velocity and low mixing of fluid however it is observed that this process was only temporary and a partial or complete relaminarization of the vortex core happened throughout the experiments depending on the radial gradient of the axial velocity and the initial turbulence level within the core as the hydrodynamically optimum propeller design may not have optimum hydroacoustic performance sezen et al 2016 it is necessary to also consider the vortex core properties and their contributions on the singing frequency of the cavitating tip vortex maines and arndt 1997a the range of the sound frequency band generated by a propeller cavitating tip vortex strongly correlates with the size of the tip vortex cavity for larger cavities the range shifts to lower frequencies pennings et al 2015c it is noted that the mean cavity size in the undisturbed section of the flow and the cavity size downstream of the wake plates can be the main contributor for the broadband sound centre frequency pennings et al 2016 the study of dynamics and noise emission of vortex cavitation bubbles by choi and ceccio 2007 showed that the noise level produced by nuclei expansion depends on the initial nuclei size where rapid rate of volume acceleration of small bubble produces an audible pulse conversely larger nuclei would begin to grow as soon as they were exposed to any tension resulting in a reduced rate of volume acceleration they also reported that the impulse produced upon collapse was typically four to five orders of magnitude larger compared to the growth and splitting noise peng et al 2015 experimentally investigated vortex singing in tvc they reported that the tones of vortex singing are very different under different flow conditions and water qualities it is also noted that the vortex singing can only exist in the transferring process between strong tip vortex cavitation and weak tip vortex cavitation also reported in peng et al 2017 park and seong 2017 investigated the effects of number of generated bubbles tvc event rate on the tvc noise scaling law by conducting experimental tests on two scaled naca 4412 elliptic hydrofoils visual and acoustic techniques was used to count the numbers of generated bubbles the blade load distribution can also contribute to tip vortex cavitation formation kuiper 2001 at highly loaded tip vorticity is generated at the trailing edge of a propeller blade resulting in a trailing vortex formation at low tip loading separation still occurs close to the tip while the trailing vortex is much weaker leading to a typical local tip vortex formation an unloaded tip forces the loading towards inner radii and at these inner radii leading edge separation and therefore a leading edge vortex may be formed in this manner effects of non uniform flow field pereira et al 2016 and blade surface roughness dreyer 2015 felli and falchi 2011 should also be considered as multiple concentrated vortices are often produced in the wake of lifting surfaces it is necessary to analyse the vortex interactions and their contributions on tip vortex cavitation inception for the case of co rotating vortices inception occurs in the region of vortex combination in the interaction of nonequivalent counter rotating vortices the weaker vortex can wrap around the stronger vortex causing the weaker vortex to be stretched choi et al 2003 showed that this stretching process can lead to cavitation inception by visualization of cavitating co rotating tip vortices chang et al 2007 confirm the vorticity bridging during the merger of vortices they also note that the vapour surface of the merging vortices is irregular indicating significant small wavelength vortex unsteadiness of the merging vortices examination of the inferred core pressure of the primary and secondary vortices before the onset of any instability suggests that the primary vortex would incept first since the core pressure of the primary vortex is lower than that of the weaker secondary vortex chang et al 2012 however they observed that in the majority of cases where the instability was present the secondary vortex incepted first often well before reaching pressures low enough for the primary vortex to incept as the reduction in the core radius of the secondary vortex alone is not sufficient to produce the tension needed to incept small nuclei and to explain the location of inception or the observed size and dynamics of the elongated bubbles they postulated that the stretched and turned secondary vortex also produces axial jetting in its core which would further reduce the pressure the inception point can be determined either through visual observations of cavitation appearance e g cavitation volume or tip vortex diameter savio et al 2009 or through acoustic measurements of the noise levels and then signal analysis of bubble bursting lee et al 2013 employed short time fourier transform stft and the detection of envelope modulation on noise demon spectrum methods in signal analysis of bubble bursting to determine the tip vortex cavitation inception they noted that considering the results of stft and demon together would provide a more accurate tool in predicting inception point kim et al 2015 employed a broadband source localization algorithm to postprocess their experimental noise measurements in order to find the tip vortex cavitation inception point comparison with visual inspection revealed that the localization algorithm successfully localized the incipient tvc earlier than the visual inspection the study of song et al 2017 on the tip vortex cavitation inception of an elliptical hydrofoil with a naca 6 6 2 415 section showed that when tvc approaches desinence the sound pressure level will slowly climb up to a local peak and then descends dramatically which is the tvc inception point they also confirm that tvc inception for the low nuclei seeding conditions occurs much earlier than the non nuclei seeding conditions and further increasing the nuclei seeding does not affect the tvc inception any more lee and seo 2013 the observations also proved that initial amount of air present in the system has a crucial impact on the stability properties of the system and therefore on the cavitation inception fuster et al 2014 where in the weak water the inception point is close to the minimum pressure criterion yang et al 2014 measurements of the tip vortex flow field provide further insights about the flow features the current study employs the measurements conducted at delft university of technology by pennings 2016 pennings et al 2015b they applied the stereoscopic particle image velocimetry piv technique to measure the flow field of a tip vortex in presence as well as in the absence of cavitation around the arndt elliptical foil during the tests the uncertainty of the inlet velocity 0 5 and the outlet pressure 0 05 were measured and reported dissolved oxygen do was used as a representative parameter of non condensable gas during the tests determined by using an optical sensor in the cavitating tip vortex condition the vapour core of vortex cavitation was not seeded and therefore the velocity was measured only outside the tip vortex cavity the tip vortex characteristics have been measured at different operating conditions in both cavitating and non cavitating conditions the effects of foil angles of attack reynolds number inlet velocity and dissolved gas concentration on tip vortex flows are measured the foil forces vortex wandering vortex velocity distributions at different section downstream of the foil cavity diameter emitted noise and cavity resonance frequency are reported for each condition pennings 2016 sum of correlation soc was used to postprocess the piv images in order to remove the effects of the vortex core wandering the measurements show that the non cavitating tip vortex has a radius around 1 mm and also accelerated axial velocity at the vortex core the diameter of the tip vortex cavity is determined by two approaches the maximum gradient of cavity shadow and proctor vortex model fit they have also proposed an analytical model for the dispersion relation of disturbances on an infinite cavitating vortex which is matched to the experimental data pennings et al 2015a 2 2 tip vortex mitigation the marine industry generally seeks only to increase the tip vortex core pressure to alleviate cavitation and to do so a few approaches are proposed and tested these approaches generally can be classified into two groups in the first group which is called active control the tip vortex flow is altered by injection of a solution e g air polymer or water in the second group either the propeller geometry is modified or its surface roughness the early study of fruman and aflalo 1989 showed that injecting a polymer solution lowers the tvc inception number the tests also revealed that polymer injection increased the tip vortex radius as well as reduced the tip vortex tangential velocity it was concluded that the increase in the tip vortex radius is responsible for the delay in cavitation inception mccormick 1962 showed that roughening the blade pressure side would also lead to tip vortex radius increase and therefore delay in tvc inception contradictory to these findings shima and tsujino 1994 indicate that polymer injection would lower water surface tension and as a result would cause tvc inception at higher cavitation numbers chahine et al 1993 tested a model propeller with polymer injection they observed up to 35 delay in tvc inception by injecting some combinations of polymer solutions they also reported that the location of the injection port was extremely important where the optimum injection port location appears to be on the suction side of the blade at the tip vortex attachment point with injection directly into the core they did not observe any significant improvement in tvc inception delay by injections of pure water or a 50 water glycerin viscous mixture later latorre et al 2004 theoretically investigated the effects of polymer presence on the cavitating tip vortex delay they reported that the influence of polymer is to increase the tip vortex core radius and delay the inception of tip vortex cavitation it is also shown that polymer injection only reduces the surface tension of small bubbles radius lower than 15 μ m which do not play significant role in cavitation inception ryo 2009 investigated the effects of the polymer injection on the tip vortex unsteadiness the unsteadiness of the flow near the hydrofoil tip caused by either vortex vortex interaction or a shear flow between a uniform velocity and vortex core velocity contributes to tvc inception mechanism this unsteadiness causes coherent fragmentation of vorticity and introduces a low pressure which can govern tvc inception yakushiji hypothesized that the elasticity of the polymer solution may suppress this fragmentation of vorticity and finally result in a higher static pressure the measurements of fruman et al 1995b also clarified that the root mean square of the tangential velocity at the vortex core is lower in the presence of the injected polymer they also showed that polymer injection does not significantly alter the distribution of the tip vortex intensity along its path and therefore the roll up of the vortex chang et al 2011 examined the tip vortex cavitation inception suppression of an elliptic hydrofoil by injection of water and polymer solution and confirmed that relatively low fluxes of mass injection in the tvc roll up region led to a substantial decrease in flow unsteadiness in the core region near the observed location of inception and this corresponded to a substantial decrease in the inception pressure rivetti et al 2014 employed air injection to mitigate the cavitating tip vortex on a kaplan turbine scale model they reported that the level of vibration and its amplitude decrease proportionally with air flow rate injected it is also reported that at the expense of a maximum efficiency drop of 0 2 air injection induces a decrease on the level of vibration from 57 up to 84 rivetti et al 2016 park et al 2014 proposed a semiactive control scheme to suppress the cavitating tip vortex on a model scale propeller by attaching a flexible thread on the tip of the blade due to low pressure region at the tip vortex core the thread would be sucked into the tip vortex three different thread materials were tested steel nylon and dyneema where only the dyneema thread was sufficiently flexible to be sucked into the tip vortex core they reported that when the thread is sucked into the vortex it can effectively suppress the tip vortex cavitation inception boulon et al 1999 investigated effects of confinement on tip vortex cavitation of an elliptical hydrofoil where the confinement is achieved by flat plates set perpendicular to the span at an adjustable distance from the tip the minimum pressure at the vortex core is decreased at the presence of confinement leading to early cavitation inception this trend essentially results from a potential effect in their study no viscous effects connected to the interaction between the tip vortex and the boundary layer which develops on the confinement wall have been observed to affect the onset of tip vortex cavitation gim and lee 2013 investigated effects of an end plate on the tip vortex formation of naca 0018 foil during their experimental measurements different angles of attack were analysed it was reported that the endplate significantly stabilizes the reynolds shear stress and reduces the tip vortex causing the prevention of vibration and cavitation the roll up wake flow at the span end of the foil is also decreased due to the endplate shin and andersen 2015 investigated the cavitating tip vortex flows of tip modified propellers they showed that reducing the blade tip loading as an effort to restrain sheet and tip vortex cavitation in the design of marine propellers can cause cloud cavitation responsible for much of noise and surface erosion brown et al 2015 investigated interactions of tip vortices downstream of a tip loaded propeller tlp having a winglet in tlp designs a winglet prevents the formation of a single strong tip vortex and instead two distinct weaker vortices were generated they noted that although rans analyses captured the formation of two tip vortices they were not able to compute the evolution of the tip vortices or provide any insight into the vortex merging process it is also noted that the separation of the two vortices has the effect of delaying the cavitation inception it is expected that the separation between the two vortices will depend on a number of factors some of those being the span of the endplate and the loading distribution of the endplate the blade surface roughness also contributes to the tip vortex properties johnsson and ruttgerson 1991 studied the influence of leading edge roughness on the tip vortex roll up for different angles of attack it is shown that application of roughness on the pressure side near the leading edge has a delaying effect on tip vortex cavitation and leads to a substantial reduction in tip vortex strength they also reported that applying the roughness can reduce the open water efficiency by 2 later it was suggested to apply roughness only on a small area of the blade suction side close to the tip trailing edge region the turbulence generated by the roughness can destabilize the tip vortex and lead to its early breakdown by employing particle image velocimetry measurements ghimire and bailey 2017 investigated the effect of the free stream turbulence on the vortex decay by increasing the free stream turbulence level they showed that the rate of vortex peak tangential velocity decay increases while the rate of core radius increase remains unchanged kruger et al 2016 reported that suction sided sand grain roughness reduces the tip vortex strength and leads to pressure increase in the vortex core souders and platzer 1981 discussed that the thicker turbulent boundary layer on the wing tip results in an increased tip vortex core radius and a decrease in the tip vortex maximum tangential velocity as compared to the laminar flow case they investigated this hypotheses by applying roughness on the tip region of a hydrofoil and considered its contributions on the tip vortex characteristics in order to avoid substantial increases in drag the roughness was applied only to those areas of the foil tip whose streamlines contributed directly to the formation of the tip vortex they reported an increase of tvc inception speed by 41 for pressure side roughness 28 for suction side roughness and 67 for pressure and suction side roughness the recent study of asnaghi et al 2019a showed the necessity of optimization of roughness area for an elliptical foil it is reported that having rough foil leads to drag increase of about 85 while the optimized roughness area drag increase is 1 7 they tested different roughness patterns and concluded that for the suction side tip vortex condition the optimum area to apply the roughness is the leading edge and trailing edge of the suction side the tvci improvement was reported to be around 33 in the optimized roughness pattern later they tested the methodology to optimize the roughness area in a model scale asnaghi et al 2019b it is reported that for the model scale propeller having a suction side tip vortex the tvci was improved by 26 while the efficiency decrease was less than 2 2 3 numerical simulation before the development of computational resources classical vortex flow fields were used to describe vortex properties as an example one can mention the study of arakeri et al 1988 where a modified lamb vortex model was employed to determine the minimum pressure coefficient in a fully rolled up tip vortex later it was also tried to include the viscosity effects on the extension of lamb queen vortex formula in order to define the tip vortex flow structure cavity size and cavity resonance frequency bosschers 2009 an analytical formula has also been proposed to describe the cavitating tip vortex flow based on the non cavitating tip vortex properties the formula represents the circumferential velocity pressure and vorticity distributions at the cavitating vortex core yamada et al 2015 developed a method to predict the radiated noise from propeller tip vortex cavitation by substituting a rankine combined vortex instead of the tip vortex then r p equation is solved inside the rankine combined vortex to find the growth of a cavitation bubble for preliminary cavitation checks in the propeller design phase a panel method seems to be the most suitable tool as the radial extent and the angular range of cavitation occurrence are predicted with acceptable accuracy shin et al 2015 wang et al 2016 however due to the incapability to model the cavitating tip vortex for the later design stages more accurate and detailed propeller performance predictions are required nowadays by taking advantage of high performance computing cfd has provided more detailed knowledge and insights about tip vortex flows implementation of cfd however in such complex flow features demands specific attentions where the outcome can be significantly altered by inappropriate selection of numerical settings it is now clear that the accuracy of tip vortex simulations depends on the numerical diffusion level and also turbulence modelling computational resolution grid quality and numerical schemes determine the numerical diffusion level as the roll up process and vortex formation involve very small scale flow structures with very high gradients and due to the high swirling nature of a vortex inappropriate selection of turbulence closure would easily lead to the overprediction of turbulent viscosity and therefore underprediction of the vortex strength in advanced cfd simulations and due to small scales of tip vortex dynamics compared to the foil or blade geometry providing appropriate resolution with sufficient number of grid points is vital some of the grid related errors come from the skewness and non orthogonality of grid lines and grid points that are not properly distributed windt and bosschers 2015 improper distribution of the grid points affects the accuracy of numerical schemes and can result in underresolving i e artificially diffusing the high gradients in the flow if numerical diffusion arising from the grid related errors and truncation errors becomes significant in comparison to that of the physical diffusion the computed vortex will be distorted there have been several studies to find the spatial resolution requirements by considering an analytical vortex dacles mariani et al 1999 found that an average of 15 20 grid points in each of the crosswise and spanwise directions in the viscous core of the tip vortex region are needed to adequately resolve the flow they also determined that the vortex is more sensitive to cross flow plane grid refinement than streamwise refinement further it was noted that third order convection scheme is too dissipative to correctly transport the vortex and at least 5th order convection schemes have to be employed later also reported by nichols 2008 duraisamy 2005 also employed 5th order accurate schemes and showed that at least 10 grid points are needed across the vortex core egolf et al 2000 reported that by using 9th order accurate convection schemes the mesh requirement across the vortex core is 7 grid points ahmad et al 2013 showed that for second order accurate solver the mesh requirement is almost twice 30 40 grid points across the vortex core the study of su et al 2013 showed that at the tip region the designed order of accuracy of the numerical scheme is seldom guaranteed and the low quality of grid points leads to more numerical dissipation than expected it was clarified by qiu et al 2010 2013 that the accuracy of the results were sensitive to the quality of the computational cells in terms of values of jacobian volume and skew angles the summary of the required grid points to predict tip vortex flows is presented in table 1 joubarne et al 2011 employed adaptation operations to modify an existing mesh in order to simulate the tip vortex flow around an elliptical naca16020 hydrofoil they compared two types of meshes hybrid meshes composed of tetrahedrons and prisms and hexahedron meshes they noted that an adapted hexahedron mesh is the best choice for computing fluid properties as far downstream as possible while close to the foil hybrid meshes can resolve the tip vortex more accurately an important difference between the two kinds of meshes is related to node distribution in the hybrid meshes the nodes are concentrated close to the profile whereas in the hexahedron mesh the nodes are more evenly distributed in the downstream region windt and bosschers windt and bosschers 2015 compared two different mesh generation strategies in predicting the tip vortex flow one is a priori mesh refinement inside a tube with a helix shaped centre line at the tip vortex region and the other is the adaptive mesh refinement using the jump based estimator they observed that as the vortex for the propeller is weaker than for the wing and the viscous core is smaller the results are extremely grid dependent in the local mesh refinement strategy it is also reported that the grid resolution at the tip does not contribute to the trust and torque predictions as they are affected by the mesh resolution on the blade it is also noted by yu et al 2017 that the shedding of the tip vortex cavitation around a skew propeller cannot be captured clearly when the grid in the trailing region of the blade tip is insufficiently detailed thereby affecting the accuracy of the tip vortex cavitation it is generally accepted that the accuracy of cfd prediction of the cavitating tip vortex flow depends strongly on the grid structure hence only the grids constructed especially for vortex dominated flows should be used together with turbulence models especially suited for modelling of such flows for turbulence closure dacles mariani et al 1999 evaluated one equation turbulence models of baldwin barth and spalart allmaras sa along with the modified production terms to simulate the tip vortex flows they also concluded that incorporating the modifications into the turbulence models gave some improvements in the prediction of the viscous vortex core but it was not fully successful in resolving tip vortex flows flaszyński et al 2009 applied the sa turbulence model to simulate the tip vortex of a propeller like hydrofoil and showed that the sa model does not allow to obtain the proper vortex structure even close to the blade suggesting that the differences appears already at the vortex origin schot et al 2014 employed the sa model along with a curvature correction to simulate the tip vortex flow around an elliptical foil tested by pennings 2016 they observed that the model is not capable to predict the accelerated flow in the tip vortex core it is also noted that although modelling the transition of the boundary layer affects the vortex viscous core size a result of the turbulent viscosity rolling up in the vortex core the turbulent modelling will alter this in the shear layer trailing the wing and will damp it during the roll up into the vortex core liang and xue 2014 showed that while the sa model underpredicts the streamwise vorticity in the tip vortex core by 40 employing des sa could capture the complicated three dimensional structures of the tip vortex more accurately on the same mesh resolution and with similar computational cost gaggero et al 2014 conducted experimental observation and numerical study of the tip for conventional and ducted propellers tip leakage vortex two layer realizable k ϵ model in conjunction with the schnerr sauer cavitation model was used to predict the cavitating tip vortex although the numerical results generally were satisfactory they observed that for instance all the cavitating vortex instabilities experimentally observed for the conventional and the ducted propellers were completely missed by the numerical computations zhang et al 2017 employed a filter based model to simulate tip leakage vortex cavitation flows the comparison of the results with rng k ϵ results show significant improvement in predicting small flow structures and better tip vortex prediction by using the filter based approach smirnov and menter 2009 extended the application of spalart shur correction spalart and shur 1997 into the sst k ω model their study showed that for confined cases i e u bend channel and flow in a cyclone employing curvature correction improves the vortex prediction however for tip vortex simulations around naca0012 including curvature correction does not improve the tip vortex flow prediction especially the prediction of the accelerated axial velocity at the vortex core hellsten 1997 proposed a curvature correction for sst k ω model based on the local richardson number in this approach the destruction term in the ω equation is modified and sensitized to the system rotation and streamline curvature asnaghi et al 2016 2017a employed sst k ω turbulence model to simulate tip vortex flow around the arndt foil they reported that even by employing curvature correction the turbulence modelling fails in predicting the accelerated axial flow at the vortex core also reported by hong and dong 2010 khatami et al 2015 ghadimi et al 2017 it is reported that the curvature correction could predict the location of the vortex core but the correction is not suitable to improve the tip vortex prediction dymarski et al 2008 compared different rans models and concluded that reynolds stress model rsm can provide more accurate results compared to one equation and two equation models wells 2009 compared rsm with sa model having curvature correction and reported that the rsm is the only model to appropriately predict a true minimum turbulent kinetic energy at the vortex centre o regan et al 2014 employed rsm to simulate the tip vortex flow around a naca0012 foil in the near field region at two different angles of attack 5 and 10 experimental measurements show that the axial velocity is accelerated in α 10 while it is decelerated at α 5 the numerical simulations were not able to predict this accelerated axial velocity they noted that the large difference observed in numerical and experimental crossflow velocity is most likely responsible for the corresponding discrepancy in axial velocity sipilä and siikonen 2012 employed rans to study cavitating tip vortex flows of the potsdam propeller test case pptc and noted that the cavitating tip vortex simulation is not very sensitive to the mass transfer rate it is also found and reported in sipilä et al 2014 that turbulence models gave significant differences to the tip vortex core solutions in wet and cavitating conditions significant differences are also found in pressure prediction at the wake region between different rans models where explicit algebraic reynolds model earsm showed slightly lower pressure at the vortex core than the results of two equation rans models viitanen and siikonen 2017 compared different turbulence models in predicting cavitating flows around the pptc in their study low reynolds number k ϵ model sst k ω sst model with an explicit algebraic reynolds stress model and also a ddes approach based on the sst k ω were evaluated differences between the tested turbulence closures in predicting global propeller performance were not considerable although the best correspondence was obtained with the k ϵ model the tip vortex was generally underpredicted wang et al 2015 compared standard and non linear k ϵ models in predicting the tip vortex flow over a rounded wingtip naca0012 foil and reported that the spatial phase shift between the mean strain rate and reynolds stresses can be more accurately modelled by the nonlinear k ϵ turbulence model liu et al 2016 compared standard and non linear k ϵ in predicting cavitating tip vortex flows over a naca0015 foil as well as the insean e779a propeller they highlighted the advantages of the nonlinear model to include the rotation rate in the constitutive relationship between the strain and the reynolds stress which implies that the correction of the rotating flow is important in the tip vortex simulation the summary of literature survey on rans models in predicting tip vortex flows is presented in table 2 uzun et al 2006 employed iles along with the overset grids to model tip vortex flow of a rounded tip naca0012 they found that the initial condition differences between numerical simulations and experimental test conditions can lead to considerable discrepancy between the numerical results and experimental measurements later in uzun and hussaini 2010 they compared the dynamic mixed model and dynamic smagorinsky model with iles in prediction of tip vortex flows and showed that the best agreement with the experiment was obtained by the iles by iles simulation of wing tip vortex flow jiang et al 2008 showed that the turbulence inside the primary tip vortex is not created by the tip vortex itself instead the turbulent shear layer and the interaction between the primary and the secondary vortices are the major sources of turbulent activity in the core decaix et al 2015a b compared the localized dynamic smagorinsky les model with sst k ω and showed that the mean behaviour of the tip vortex is well captured by both rans and les but the dynamics of the tip vortex was damped out in rans simulations as high order numerical schemes and grid resolution requirements for vortex simulation are computationally costly some methods are developed to compensate the numerical dissipation in vortex flows e g the vorticity confinement model zhang et al 2014 employed a vorticity confinement method along with rans to simulate a propeller tip vortex they obtained an accurate prediction of the tip vortex in the near field region although they observed vorticity confinement had some effects on the calculated vortex strength o regan et al 2016 employed the vorticity confinement model to simulate wing tip vortex flows in the near field region along with urans and les the focus was on preventing the rapid dissipation of vorticity in a wing tip vortex they examined different mesh resolutions where the finest had 13 cells across the vortex core it is noted that urans could not predict the accelerated vortex core axial velocity at high angles of attack they also show that urans quickly diminishes the turbulence downstream of the wing with velocity fluctuation orders of magnitude less than the experimental data it is also shown that les and the vorticity confinement method can predict different characteristics of the vortex quite well other methods such as the variational multiscale method bensow and larson 2010 can be employed to counteract the excessive numerical dissipation in order to preserve vortices in numerical flow simulations from a cfd perspective a few attempts have been conducted to develop the tip vortex inception criteria as a post processing tool one can mention minimum pressure criterion and low pressure volume method in this method the cavitation inception number is considered to be equal to minus of the minimum pressure coefficient c p in another method the volume occupied by the pressure lower than the saturation pressure is considered yvin and muller 2016 conducted numerical simulations on the pptc propeller studying inception based on the low pressure volume method and as the inception data were available the minimum volume occupied by the lowest pressures which leads to cavitation inception was identified there have been a couple of studies including the dynamics of bubbles from the lagrangian point of view into the tip vortex flow formation which is the eulerian framework this approach becomes important in the tip vortex inception condition where the dynamics of bubbles and their interactions with tip vortex properties define the inception in this approach the bubble dynamics is governed by the r p equation hsiao and chahine 2004 2005 employed this approach to simulate the acoustic pressure generated by cavitation inception in a tip vortex flow over an elliptical foil considering the scale effects they noted that at larger scales more bubbles incept per unit time the main reason is that at the larger scales the nuclei capture area and the size of the vortex core are increased it is noted that predicted cavitation inception number depends on the nuclei size distributions where at higher nuclei sizes the predicted cavitation inception numbers tends to c p this implies that scaling effects due to nuclei size distribution are stronger when the water contains only small nuclei later hsiao et al 2015 developed a multiscale two phase flow eulerian lagrangian approach to include tracking of micro bubbles in the micro scale along with capturing large cavities at the macro scale the model was employed to simulate cavitating flows around a propeller where different cavitation regimes appears simultaneously they also considered the nucleation from the rigid boundaries in addition to bubble nuclei dispersed in the liquid in their model park et al 2009 employed eulerian lagrangian approach along with rans turbulence modelling in their study rans is coupled with the dissipation vortex model for the efficient eulerian flow field analysis then the nuclei trajectories are calculated considering various forces acting on the nuclei finally calculated radius variation of the cavitation bubble and the trajectory are used as the input of cavitation bubble noise analysis abdel maksoud et al 2010 reported that within the region having pressure lower than the saturation pressure where the nuclei experience the growth the trajectory of the bubble would be dependent on the considered forces acting on the bubble they highlighted that only the use of detailed equations of motion correctly describes the bubble trajectories independent from the fluid paths in vortex flows where pressure changes crosswise to streamlines choi and chahine 2004 2007 compared spherical and non spherical bubble assumption in predicting the tip vortex cavitation and related collapse pressure pulses they show that the collapse pressure pulse predicted by non spherical elongated bubbles is much higher than the one predicted by the spherical bubble assumption which corresponds to the pressure peaks measured during the experiments at the moment of the bubble splitting as the non spherical behaviour becomes important only below the cavitation inception no difference reported for cavitation inception prediction by spherical and non spherical models by simulating vortex cavitation bubbles choi et al 2009 noted that large nuclei with near zero critical tension will grow in a quasi steady manner while small nuclei which require larger tension to incept can grow explosively when the critical tension is reached ni et al 2012 applied one way particle tracking method ptm and the boundary element method bem to simulate trajectory and deformation of bubbles in tip vortex flows in the first step of their simulations and before the bubble being captured the bubble dynamics equation is solved to predict trajectory and volume oscillation of the bubble the second step is after the bubble is captured in which the final conditions of the first stage are taken as the input and the bubble motion such as growth elongation or splitting can be simulated by solving the non spherical bubble model with the bem 3 governing equations 3 1 conservation equations using the low pass filtering approach the conservation equations of

les turbulence modelling most turbulent flows consist of vortex filaments and sheets with characteristic scales of the orders between the taylor and kolmogorov scales l t and l k respectively typically being orders of magnitude smaller than the reference length of the flow l ref the following relations are used to estimate these turbulent length scales where the reference length of the flow is assumed to be equal to the foil root chord length davidson 2013 5 l t 10 l k 2 3 l ref 1 3 6 l k ν 3 ϵ ave 0 25 where 7 ϵ ave u ref 3 l ref in these equations ϵ ave is the dissipation rate per unit mass and ν is the kinematic viscosity the taylor micro scale is an intermediate length scale at which fluid viscosity significantly affects the dynamics of turbulent eddies in the flow in dns all flow scales down to l k are resolved making such simulations too expensive for engineering applications instead les in which all the flow scales smaller than l t are modelled thus having weaker resolution requirements have emerged as a viable alternative for engineering predictions rans on the other hand is dependent on the characteristics of the mean flow which in general implies lower resolution requirements compared with les in this paper two different strategies are considered to model the les subgrid stress tensor implicit les iles and localized dynamic kinematic subgrid stress model ldkm as an explicit model in iles no explicit model is applied for b i j instead the numerical dissipation is considered enough to mimic the action of b i j fureby 2006 rider 2006a bensow and bark 2010 asnaghi 2015 therefore for the momentum convection term a scheme that can provide iles results should be used rider 2006b in ldkm the subgrid scale stress is defined as 8 b i j 2 3 ρ k sgs δ

the pressure field of the tip vortex the cavitation index definition is employed 13 σ p p sat 1 2 ρ u ref 2 where p s a t is the saturation pressure 3 3 cavitation modelling 3 3 1 cavitation inception this section introduces two concepts that are later used when assessing cavitation inception in the tip vortex the minimum pressure criterion and the rayleigh plesset equation the application of these in the estimation of cavitation inception is discussed further at section 7 2 1 in the minimum pressure criterion the cavitation inception point is determined as 14 σ i c p min where c p min is the minimum pressure coefficient one can also use a curve fitting approach to provide the dependency of the tip vortex cavitation inception on the reynolds number foil geometry and nuclei distribution for an elliptical foil in weak water arndt 1995 suggested the following formula 15 σ i 0 068 c l 2 r e 0 4 the rayleigh plesset r p equation which governs the dynamics of a single spherical bubble is 16 r d 2 r d t 2 3 2 d r d t 2 4 ν l r d r d t 2 s ρ l r p b t p t ρ l where r is the radius of the bubble ν l is the kinematic viscosity of the liquid s is the liquid surface tension ρ l is the liquid density p b t is the bubble inside pressure and p t is the pressure at the far field the summation of the vapour pressure p v and the dissolved gas pressure p g defines the bubble inside pressure 17 p b t p v t p g t at equilibrium condition the r p equation reduces to 18 p b p 2 s r therefore at the initial condition and by equilibrium condition assumption the dissolved gas pressure can be obtained as follows 19 p g0 p 0 2 s r 0 p v by ideal gas assumption for the bubble dissolved gas content the dissolved gas pressure at any time can be derived from 20 p g p g0 r 0 r t γ where γ is equal to one for isothermal bubble expansion considering that p b t is known and p t is given the time varying bubble radius can be calculated from the r p equation eq 16 3 3 2 mass transfer modelling transport equation model tem is employed to model the two phase flow in this approach both the vapour and liquid phases are treated as incompressible and the volume fraction is used to specify the distribution of each phase the mixture flow properties are calculated based on the homogeneous mixture assumption 21 ρ m α l ρ l 1 α l ρ v μ m α l μ l 1 α l μ v this two phase mixture assumption as compared with a two fluid modelling is well in line with the filtering in les small bubbles that are not possible to resolve are seen as a mixture through the les filter this will hold also for larger bubbles unless the grid is aligned with the interface which is not a computationally reasonable approach for complex flows bensow and bark 2010 in order to model the mass transfer between phases a source term is added to the right hand side of the liquid volume fraction transport equation 22 α l t α l u i x i m ρ l in the current study the schnerr sauer model is used to compute the mass transfer between the phases 23 m c sign p p threshold α l 1 α l α nuc r b 3 ρ l ρ v ρ m 2 p p threshold 3 ρ l where c c c c v is applied to adjust and calibrate the mass transfer rate in this equation p threshold is the pressure level where mass transfer occurs and α nuc is the averaged volume fraction of the nuclei in order to avoid manual adjustment of the mass transfer coefficient the coefficient of the original model are modified based on the velocity strain rate time scale and the mean flow time scale the condensation coefficient c c allows for some retardation in the condensation wikstrom et al 2003 therefore a constant condensation coefficient c c 1 is used and the coefficient modification is employed for the evaporation coefficient 24 c v 1 t ref 1 2 u i x j u j x i the time scale of the mean flow t ref l ref u ref is also employed to normalize the velocity strain rate value further information regarding the concepts and results of this modification can be found in asnaghi et al 2017c the average nuclei per liquid volume is considered constant and equal to n 0 1 0 8 and the initial nuclei diameter is d nuc 1 0 6 m in the current study the values of α nuc and r b are defined by 25 α nuc π n 0 d nuc 3 6 1 π n 0 d nuc 3 6 26 r b 3 4 π n 0 1 α nuc α l α l 3 in order to take into account the effects of viscous shear stresses on the liquid rupturing and phase change the threshold pressure is modified based on the magnitude of the shear strain rate joseph 1998 asnaghi et al 2017c 2014 the pressure threshold which determines the onset of cavitation in the flowing fluid is presented as follows 27 p threshold μ γ p sat p a p sat 28 γ 2 d i j d i j this added pressure p a μ γ is important if either shear strain rate or effective viscosity is large and comparable with the saturation pressure 4 case description the tip vortex flow around arndt elliptical foil is selected as a test case in order to gain insight about the flow pattern operating conditions and tip vortex properties as well as the requirements for numerical simulation of this type of the flow the geometry of the foil is an elliptical planform having the naca 6 6 2 415 cross section having naca 6 series section introduces a low adverse pressure gradient over the foil and therefore longer laminar boundary layer the foil is often used for experiments and analysis of vortex cavitation the foil has been tested at different institutes in various operating conditions both in wet and cavitating conditions arndt et al 1991 arndt and keller 1992 pennings et al 2015b schot et al 2014 in the current study the experimental study conducted in the cavitation tunnel in the laboratory for ship hydrodynamics at delft technical university pennings et al 2015b schot et al 2014 is selected for comparison with the numerical results the computational domain mimics the cavitation tunnel dimensions where the inlet is placed approximately four chord lengths in front of the foil and the outlet is placed ten chord lengths behind the foil fig 1 the trailing edge of the tested foil was truncated at a thickness of 0 3 mm due to manufacturing limitations where the root chord length after truncation is c 0 0 1256 m the total projected area of the foil obtained from the 3d cad model is 0 01465 m 2 which is used as the reference area to compute non dimensional parameters e g lift coefficient the foil has a half span of 150 mm summarized in table 3 so that the tip is positioned in the centre of the test section the foil is also placed in the middle of the channel width where distance to each side is equal to 150 mm pennings et al 2015b the simulations are conducted at the inlet velocity of 6 8 m s which corresponds to the reynolds number of 8 95 1 0 5 presented in table 4 three different angles of attack 9 7 and 5 are considered to evaluate the operating conditions impact on the tip vortex properties 5 spatial mesh description as the vortex roll up and transport involve very small scales of the flow structures and physics even very small amount of numerical diffusion will damp these scales and therefore will lead to incorrect prediction of vortex properties therefore one of the most important challenges of numerical analysis of tip vortex flows is to provide appropriate mesh resolution at the vortex core region in order to systematically investigate the spatial resolution requirement for numerical analysis of the tip vortex employing hexahedral cells at the tip vortex region is considered to address this starccm of siemens plc is used to generate the mesh in the first step a coarse mesh without refinement of the tip vortex region is generated the flow is simulated to find an approximate tip vortex trajectory the trajectory path is then exported into starccm to define a priori refinement zones two cylindrical regions are considered around the trajectory path to specify the mesh resolution having 10 mm for inner refinement cylinder irc and 60 mm for outer refinement cylinder orc diameters respectively as the objective is to investigate the mesh requirement for vortex prediction in the near field region these cylindrical refinement regions are extended 1 5 chord length downstream of the foil in fig 2 cell distribution in the streamwise and inplane sections are presented the boundary layer in all of the resolutions are fully resolved in the wall normal direction y 1 20 prismatic layers having extrusion factor of 1 15 are used to provide appropriate boundary layer resolution around the foil the baseline mesh resolution on the foil follows x z 250 which fulfils the requirement for a wall resolved les simulations however in the relevant tip region the refinement regions also affect the surface resolution and even finer mesh density is achieved in this region to investigate the inplane and streamwise mesh requirement five different resolutions are created the surface resolution and prismatic layers y 1 of these meshes are the same and the only difference between them is the resolution of the inner refinement cylinder fig 2 in table 5 the specifications of these meshes are presented it is reported that the tip vortex core of the selected operating condition has a diameter around 1 mm therefore the sizes and dimensions in table 5 are selected accordingly to provide a certain number of cells in the streamwise and inplane directions for the coarsest resolution p1s1 a streamwise resolution finer than taylor length scale l t 4 1 0 4 m is selected the inplane resolution is selected as half of the taylor length scale in order to provide at least 8 cells in the vortex core then two more meshes are created with the same streamwise resolution but finer inplane resolution p2s1 and p3s1 for streamwise mesh resolution study p2s1 is selected as the base resolution and is refined in the streamwise direction to obtain p2s2 and p2s3 meshes in order to investigate effects of foil wake on the vortex roll up the mesh resolution of p2s2 is also refined in the wing wake region so called p2s2 wake fig 2 c it should be noted that the inner refinement cylinder also covers the tip surface of the foil therefore the surface resolution at that region follows the inner refinement cylinder resolution 6 numerical settings the openfoam package used in this study for numerical simulation is an open source code written in c to model and simulate fluid dynamics and continuum mechanics it is possible to employ the code and build new functionalities libraries solvers and utilities the software is community driven where various communities are working on different fields of applications in openfoam the spatial discretization is performed using a cell centred collocated finite volume fv method for unstructured meshes with arbitrary cell shapes and a multi step scheme is used for the time derivatives to complete the fv discretization the face fluxes need to be reconstructed from grid variables at adjacent cells requiring interpolation of the convective fluxes and difference approximations for the inner derivatives of the diffusive fluxes see openfoam 2015 for more details on the discretization and the numerical schemes used in openfoam for unsteady simulations the pimple algorithm a merge of the simple and piso algorithms is used to solve the coupling between the velocity and pressure asnaghi 2015 the solver tolerances based on the residuals of pressure and velocity in each iteration is set equal to 10 7 for good convergence at each time step at least two outer loops are performed and in each loop at least two pressure correction loops are performed a second order implicit time scheme i e a three level backward scheme is used for time discretization with a fixed time step equal to 10 6 s which provides courant number lower than one for this flow condition in order to get the developed flow faster larger time steps are used at the beginning of simulations for the coarsest resolution simulations are started from the initial condition equal to the reference flow properties it is noted that the forces converge much faster than the time it takes for the tip vortex to develop therefore several pressure probes are considered along the tip vortex trajectory to check the development of the tip vortex and its convergence which usually takes up to 10 t ref defined in table 4 when the tip vortex is developed the time step gradually is reduced to the desired value i e 10 6 s then the data collecting and flow averaging are conducted for at least 0 1 s in each case which corresponds to 5 5 t ref the simulations of finer resolutions are stared from the flow field mapped from the coarser resolution having the same operating condition then the convergence check and data averaging procedure are repeated as describe earlier the computations are carried out on the hebbe hpc cluster of chalmers center for computational science and engineering c3se where each computational node contains 20 cpu cores and has 64 gb of ram for each simulations the number of nodes is selected in a way to roughly set 180 k cells per core for the p2s2 resolution this leads to a wall clock time of ca 8 s per time step considering the averaging period i e 0 1 s the simulation time to sample data for this resolution is around 10 days a second order upwinding scheme linearupwindv is employed to interpolate the face velocity values in iles for ldkm a less dissipative second order linear scheme limitedlinearv which is a tvd limited central differencing scheme is employed the other face properties are interpolated by a second order linear scheme all of the surface gradients have been corrected to consider non orthogonality of the computational cells the convective schemes used are in general considered to be too diffusive for les the choice of the schemes for this study was forced due to issues in grid generation the converted meshes from starccm to openfoam generally contain a few highly skewed faces and also show high non orthogonality between neighbouring cells these poor quality cells typically appear either on the interface of the prismatic boundary layer and the volumetric cells or at the interface of the refinement regions and volumetric cells the consequence is local stability issues and therefore enforcing a limitation in using more accurate schemes however in the flow regions of interest the mesh quality is very high with well aligned orthogonal hexahedron cells given the good agreement with experimental data we thus believe the numerics in the relevant regions are sufficiently good for the simulations presented in the paper some previous studies on the impact of the numerical schemes selection in openfoam is conducted and reported in asnaghi 2018 however a more thorough study on numerical schemes and their impact on the tip vortex prediction for a general flow remains for future work 7 results the vortex core properties e g the velocity and pressure are presented to evaluate the numerical results the experimental measurements include the streamwise i e axial and tangential i e in plane velocity components at the vortex core centre normalized by the inlet velocity pennings et al 2015b in order to identify the vortex core centre the minimum pressure is employed while it is assumed that the minimum pressure occurs in the centre of the vortex numerical analysis contains comparisons of the normalized axial velocity the cavitation index along the vortex core and vortex trajectories between different cases and conditions the cavitation index is computed according to the inlet velocity outlet pressure and the liquid density the vortex trajectory which represents the location of the vortex core centre along the streamwise direction z coordinate in the current study is normalized by the root chord length of the foil 7 1 wet flow 7 1 1 spatial mesh resolution dependency the first part of the results contains the effects of the spatial resolution on the vortex properties for each mesh resolution three different vortex properties are computed and compared vortex trajectory normalized streamwise velocity vortex core axial velocity and the cavitation index fig 3 presents the tip vortex properties at the vortex core for different inplane resolutions cavitation index is selected to represent the pressure field as the negative cavitation index indicates the regions where cavitation can be expected the cavitation index curves fig 3 a show that all of the selected inplane resolutions predict negative pressure at the region close to the tip z c 0 0 2 however the negative pressure predicted by p2s1 and p3s1 is almost twice the value predicted by p1s1 while the vortex core pressure of p1s1 becomes positive after z c 0 0 35 the other two resolutions predict negative pressure at the core until the end of the refined zones z c 0 1 6 the minimum pressure predicted by p2s1 and p3s1 are almost the same but the region of this minimum pressure is larger in p3s1 close to the end of the refinement region z c 0 1 5 all of the resolutions show sudden increase in the pressure the main reason of this sudden change is the impact of the coarse resolution outside the refined zone into the upstream region comparison of the vortex trajectories fig 3 b shows similar prediction by different inplane resolutions slight difference at the centre region 0 6 z c 0 1 0 is considered to be due to the foil wake flow roll up contributions into the tip vortex development all of the considered inplane resolutions are able to capture the accelerated axial velocity at the centre of the vortex fig 3 c the location of the maximum velocity corresponds to the location of the minimum pressure moreover while the maximum velocity predicted by p1s1 is almost 1 8 times larger than the inlet velocity p2s1 and p3s1 predict maximum velocity 2 2 times larger than the inlet velocity similar to the cavitation index prediction both p2s1 and p3s1 resolutions show similar trend in reduction of the velocity according to the comparisons presented in fig 3 inplane resolution p2 is selected as sufficient inplane resolution for tip vortex prediction fig 4 presents the results of streamwise mesh variations while inplane resolution is kept constant and equal to p2 resolution results show that the effects of the streamwise resolution on the tip vortex prediction is less than the inplane resolution this is related to the fact that the flow variations in the inplane section of the tip vortex due to the rotational nature of the vortex is larger than the variations in the streamwise direction the pressure distributions predicted by p2s1 p2s2 and p2s3 resolutions show similar trend even though the pressure predicted by p2s1 is slightly lower than the two other resolutions fig 4 a contradictory to the inplane resolution variation where increasing the inplane resolution lead to lower pressure at the vortex centre increasing the streamwise resolution leads to slightly higher pressure in the vortex core having higher streamwise resolution also leads to prediction of higher axial velocity fig 4 c this means that increasing the streamwise resolution leads to prediction of lower rotational velocity fig 5 a p2s1 resolution which has coarsest streamwise resolution shows more rapid decrease of the axial velocity especially after 0 8 z c 0 the maximum axial velocity predicted at the centre of the vortex by different streamwise resolutions are similar almost twice the inlet velocity similar contribution of coarse resolution outside the refinement region is also observed on the prediction of the pressure and velocity of the vortex core at 1 5 z c 0 according to the mesh resolution investigation p2s2 resolution is considered to be suitable to capture the physics of the vortex at reasonable computational cost in fig 5 b the normalized azimuthal velocity at the vortex core region at the section of z c 0 1 14 for p2s2 and p1s1 resolutions are plotted and compared with the experimental data pennings 2016 the results related to p2s2 show very good agreement with the experiment while p1s1 results show underprediction of the azimuthal velocity in figs 6 and 7 the velocity distributions at three different sections downstream of the foil are presented and compared with the experimental piv data the sections are z c 0 0 5 075 and 1 14 piv images are derived by employing sum of correlation soc conditional weighted averaging of experimental measurements see pennings et al 2015b for the effect this has on the results while the numerical results are time averaged therefore a small portion of the discrepancy between numerical results and experimental measurements are related to the difference in averaging methods it is however anticipated that the agreement would improve if the same averaging would have been used axial velocity distribution shows that the numerical approach can accurately predict the accelerated velocity at the centre of the vortex the vortex roll up which can be seen in the increase of the axial velocity between z c 0 0 5 and z c 0 0 75 is slightly under predicted in the numerical simulations one possible reason for this can be the coarse resolution in the wake region of the foil the results clearly show that employed numerical tool i e grid turbulence closure model and also the numerical schemes are well suited together to predict the tip vortex flow in the previous study of the authors asnaghi et al 2017a it is presented that the boundary layer development on the foil and specifically the boundary layer separation line prediction contributes significantly to the vortex core formations and its characteristics it was shown that even by employing the proper grid resolution sst k ω model fails in predicting the correct boundary layer on the wing and therefore the pressure field on it this wing pressure field difference between iles and sst k ω model causes different formations of tip vortex where in iles the flow is sucked into the tip core leading to correct prediction of accelerated core axial velocity this low pressure in the tip and leading edge regions where the vortex rolls up is presented in fig 8 a at the tip where the tip vortex forms the flow becomes highly 3 dimensional leading to high velocity gradients these high velocity gradients not only contribute to the high turbulent viscosity but also to high wall shear stresses and consequently the skin friction fig 8 b distributions of the friction coefficient at lower sections on the suction side are presented in fig 9 where in each section the distance from the leading edge normalized by the local chord length is used to calculate the local reynolds number re z ρ u inlet z μ c z in fig 9 the friction coefficient is presented at 3 different distances from the foil tip i e x s 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 the friction coefficient distributions over a flat plate at different conditions are included in the figure as well the flat plat data cover fully turbulent boundary layer fully laminar boundary layer and conditions with different pressure gradients or inlet turbulence intensities the coefficient distributions of the foil show four distinguishable regions the first region locates in 0 075 z c z 0 225 where the laminar boundary layer are destabilized showing lower destabilization impact at sections with further distance from the tip compared with the flat plat data having different pressure gradient conditions one can correlate this destabilization with having higher pressure gradients at sections closer to the foil tip the second region is located in 0 225 z c z 0 6 where the flow has become laminar the flow separates from the foil surface in the third region 0 6 z c z 0 7 leading to very low friction forces after 0 7 z c z the flow is separated and shed from the foil as trailing vortices these results have a very good agreement with the experimental oil flow visualizations conducted by maines and arndt 1997b where it is found that the separation bubbles are laminar their measurements indicate that the foil cross section at the considered operating condition develops a favourable pressure gradient to approximately 60 70 percent of the chord from the leading edge this favourable pressure gradient is believed to be responsible for the boundary layer re laminarization after 0 225 z c z in table 6 numerical prediction of lift coefficient is presented for different resolutions the results are also compared with the experimental data exp c l 0 67 and comparative errors are also included the relative error of the lift coefficient for the selected resolution p2s2 is 2 7 7 1 2 ranking operating conditions variations of angle of attack in order to evaluate the contribution of the operating conditions on the tip vortex properties and also validate the capability of the numerical setup on ranking different operating conditions three different aoas are considered 9 7 and 5 for each angle two different computational resolutions are created p1s1 which is the coarsest tested resolution and p2s2 which is found to be a sufficient resolution for tip vortex analysis of the current case the flow conditions i e inlet velocity and reynolds number are the same figs 10 and 11 show the variation of axial velocity and cavitation index at the vortex core for different aoas results indicate that for α 7 the vortex close to the foil is stronger than for the other two aoas while at α 9 the vortex roll up contributes more to the vortex formation slightly downstream and as a result the decay of the vortex is slower compared to of the other aoas further we remark that these plots also show that resolutions p1s1 and p2s2 predict different rankings of behaviour with operating conditions in table 7 numerical prediction of lift coefficients of each aoa are presented and compared with the experimental data for all of the tested angles increasing resolution from p1s1 to p2s2 will lead to better prediction of lift force however the accuracy of lift prediction decreases by decreasing foil aoa although the trend is exaggerated as the relative error is listed 7 1 3 wake resolution effects fig 12 shows the distribution of the instantaneous and averaged q fields for p2s2 and p2s2 wake resolutions in this figure the iso surface of pressure equal to saturation pressure is also plotted as a red surface to distinguish the location of the tip vortex the figure clearly shows that by employing a finer resolution at the wake region smaller structures of the flow are resolved resolving smaller scales in p2s2 wake leads to finer details in the q field further these small structures are rolled up into the tip vortex region and therefore strengthen the vortex comparison between pressure iso surfaces in fig 13 shows that in p2s2 wake the region with pressure lower than the saturation pressure is larger which represents the stronger tip vortex the q distributions on the foil however are very similar for p2s2 and p2s2 wake resolutions both of the resolutions show that separation of flow happens at around z c 0 0 6 more clearly seen in the flow streamlines of fig 13 note that in this figure the streamlines are computed based on an instantaneous velocity field and therefore represent the streamline tracing haeglad 2009 the distributions of vortex properties fig 14 a show that the pressure and axial velocity predicted by p2s2 wake resolution is lower than predictions of the p2s2 resolution the main reason for the presence of lower pressure in p2s2 wake can be correlated to the azimuthal velocity the comparisons of velocity distributions at z c 0 0 5 and 1 14 sections fig 15 show that in the p2s2 wake case the axial velocity is lower than the axial velocity of the p2s2 case however due to the contribution from roll up which is higher in p2s2 wake the azimuthal velocity becomes larger in p2s2 wake case leading to lower pressure at the vortex core for p2s2 wake case 7 1 4 comparison between iles and ldkm the comparison of vortex properties between the iles and ldkm results are presented in fig 16 the pressure prediction at the vortex core is similar for these two models except close to the foil z c 0 0 2 where ldkm shows lower pressure prediction close to the end of the refinement region z c 0 1 4 ldkm shows more sensitivity to the mesh size variation the contribution of the mesh size variation can also be observed at the vortex trajectory prediction at 0 4 z c 0 1 4 region it can also be observed that the decay rate of the accelerated velocity is higher in ldkm leading to lower axial velocity predictions by ldkm comparing to iles predictions no obvious difference is found between the q distributions of the ldkm and iles fig 17 both of the models show the boundary layer separates at the region around z c 0 0 6 similar structures are also found in the instantaneous and averaged q fields the tip zoomed view of q distribution clearly show that close to the tip the flow is dominated by very small structures and is fully three dimensional stinebring et al 1991 also observed similar tip vortex flow characteristics during their measurements in fig 18 the distribution of azimuthal velocity at the z c 0 1 14 is presented the comparison shows that both models have predicted the velocity distribution quite well the lift force however is predicted slightly better by ldkm table 8 the distribution of the sub grid turbulent kinetic energy at the vortex core region is presented in fig 19 the results show that the vortex core contains the highest turbulent kinetic energy similar to results reported by wells 2009 with rsm as the vortex core can be assumed laminar due to small fluctuations this high turbulent kinetic energy is believed to be related to the high turbulent production at the vortex core resulted from high velocity spatial gradients in this region 7 2 cavitating flow 7 2 1 cavitation inception as it is discussed in the literature survey the experimental assessment of cavitation inception is not straightforward and suffers from large uncertainties this comes from the complex dependency of the tvci on the reynolds number through the boundary layer development on blades shear layer vorticity interaction in the blade wake and primarily nuclei distribution and its interaction with the vortex region further there are technical difficulties in distinguishing the actual inception point as a result this makes validation of numerical predictions of inception points almost out of reach even though wet tip vortex flows can be predicted reasonably well by consideration of some simplifications however some methods are proposed to numerically predict inception points the minimum pressure criterion c p and r p bubble dynamics method are the most investigated approaches in this section numerical results of tip vortex cavitation inception of these methods are presented and compared the results are compared with the experimental data of an inception curve suggested by arndt 1995 eq 15 in the minimum pressure criterion the inception point can be obtained from the vortex core minimum pressure for bubble dynamics modelling variation of pressure over time exerted on a bubble passing through the vortex core trajectory is required the pressure and velocity distribution along the vortex core trajectory are presented in figs 3 and 14 considering the location and axial velocity of a particle travelling along the vortex trajectory the exerted pressure on the particle over time can be calculated fig 20 as the axial velocity predicted by p2s2wake resolution is higher at the vortex core it takes shorter time for a particle to travel through the vortex trajectory in the p2s2wake case for a single bubble dynamics investigations it is assumed that the bubble is at equilibrium condition with the surrounding before entering the vortex trajectory moreover the vortex core pressure is considered as the exerted pressure on the bubble the reaction of the bubble to the lower pressure region strongly depends on the initial gas content and also initial bubble radius as equilibrium condition is assumed for the bubble at initial condition the initial gas pressure and bubble pressure can be related via eq 19 therefore the only variable parameter is the initial bubble radius here different initial bubble radii are considered ranging from 1 μ m till 200 μ m for each initial bubble radius the r p equation is solved according to the exerted pressure to obtain the variation of the bubble radius over time the conditions that the bubble radius exceeds 5 mm is considered as an indicator of cavitation inception in fig 21 predicted cavitation inception numbers for different initial bubble radii are presented including the values achieved using the minimum pressure criterion the figure clearly shows the dependency of the predicted cavitation inception number on the initial bubble radius similar to the experimental measurements where the lack of nuclei delays the cavitation inception at lower bubble radius lower values are predicted for the cavitation inception number as expected by increasing the initial bubble radius the predicted cavitation inception number by the r p model approaches the value predicted by the minimum pressure criterion the minimum pressure criterion implicitly includes the assumption of homogeneous phase change proposing instantaneous mass transfer as the pressure falls below the saturation pressure bubbles with higher radii have lower response time to the surrounding pressure as a result larger bubbles response faster to low pressure field which is similar to the homogeneous mass transfer assumption in arndt and keller 1992 the tip vortex cavitation inception dependency on the water quality is investigated in the context of weak water no tensile strength and strong water rupture considerably below vapour pressure the weak water resembles the homogeneous assumption where there is no tensile strength for the strong water the estimated initial nuclei size responsible for the tensile strength was around 2 μ m from figure 12 of this reference and for lift coefficient similar to the current study c l 0 67 the interpolated values of cavitation inception for weak and strong water are 5 47 and 2 81 respectively comparing the weak water inception value 5 47 with c p values and also comparing the strong water inception value 2 81 with results of bubble radius 1 μ m of fig 21 clearly show that the current results are in very good agreement with the experimental measurements the dependency of cavitation inception prediction by the r p model suggests that for accurate tip vortex cavitation inception prediction it is necessary to determine the size of nuclei that can be sucked into the vortex core area and therefore accurate prediction of inception by the r p approach requires coupled bubble and flow simulations 7 2 2 eulerian two phase flow simulations the cavitating tip vortex simulations are conducted on p1s1 and p2s2wake resolutions at α 9 employing iles turbulence model in these simulations the outlet pressure is varied to match the corresponding cavitation number while the inlet velocity is kept fixed the simulated conditions cover different ranges of cavitation numbers including σ 4 2 2 6 1 7 and 1 2 in fig 22 the iso surfaces of vapour volume fraction α v 0 1 at different operating conditions are represented at the cavitation number of 4 2 cavitation appears only as a weak cavitating tip vortex cavitation as the pressure field is predicted more accurately in p2s2wake resolution than in the p1s1 resolution the cavitating tip vortex is longer and stronger in p2s2wake resolution by lowering the cavitation number the pressure at the tip vortex reduces further leading to stronger tip vortex cavitation at these conditions a thin leading edge cavitation also appears more visible at σ 1 2 while at σ 4 2 the discrepancy between p1s1 and p2s2wake is significant at σ 1 2 both resolutions show similar cavitation prediction where both of the resolutions were able to capture the cavitating tip vortex quit well until the end of the refinement region the reason is the contribution of the presence of vapour on the vortex core diameter in fig 23 the comparison of vortex radius at cavitating conditions between experimental measurements and numerical simulations is presented in this figure r c represents the vortex radius at cavitating condition determined by α v 0 1 and where r v 1 1 mm is the vortex radius at wet flow condition from the figure it can be observed that lowering the cavitation number leads to larger cavitating vortex radius r c r v at the cavitation number σ 1 2 the normalized cavitating vortex radius r c r v becomes equal to 2 3 according to the measurements it suggests that while at wet flow condition and for p1s1 resolution the vortex core diameter was covered by 16 computational cells at cavitating condition of σ 1 2 the vortex core contains almost twice the number of cells this number of cells per vortex core aligns well with the mesh dependency study where it is found at least 32 cells per vortex core diameter is required to correctly predict the tip vortex at the near field region it is concluded that mesh resolution requirements to model wet tip vortex flows are higher than the cavitating tip vortex in fig 24 the distributions of the azimuthal velocity at the section of z c 0 1 14 for different cavitation numbers are presented and compared with the experimental measurements from the experimental measurements it can be deduced that by lowering the cavitation number the vortex diameter increases and also the maximum value of azimuthal velocity decreases simulations conducted on p2s2wake resolution can predict the velocity distributions very well fig 24 b it can also follow the trend of velocity variations over different cavitation numbers the maximum value of the azimuthal velocity and also its location are well predicted for different cavitation numbers in p1s1 resolution fig 24 a the accuracy of velocity prediction improves by lowering the cavitation number at σ 4 2 as the spatial resolution is coarse the discrepancy between p1s1 prediction and experimental measurements are considerable the predicted velocity field at σ 4 2 and σ 2 6 are similarly suggesting very small contribution of the vapour presence on the flow field at this section z c 0 1 14 at lower cavitation number where the vortex diameter becomes larger the accuracy of the results improves 8 conclusion in this paper les studies of tip vortex flows around an elliptical foil are presented to investigate the requirements of numerical simulations for cavitation inception and cavitating tip vortex flows in the near field region numerical setup and conditions follow the experimental test conditions recently conducted by pennings at delft university of technology pennings 2016 the mesh dependency study clarifies that at least 32 grid points across the vortex core diameter are required to accurately predict the tip vortex with the current numerics the streamwise grid point demand is found to be lower with cell size equal to 16 grid points across the vortex core diameter as the streamwise gradients of the flow properties are lower compared to the inplane flow gradients as the openfoam package can be reasonably considered as a second order accurate numerical tool these findings are found to match with the previous reports on les analysis of tip vortex flows as the tip vortex formation and its roll up are mostly governed by the boundary layer on the tip of the foil which is covered by the mesh refinement regions further refinements of the spatial mesh on the wake of the foil is found not to have significant contributions on the tip vortex prediction comparisons of the velocity distributions between numerical results and experimental piv images show very good agreement it highlights the capability of the current approach in predicting the accelerated axial velocity at the vortex core and therefore good prediction of the pressure distribution which is very important in cavitation inception studies it also demonstrates that the suggested resolution is suitable for tip vortex analysis in the near field region which is the main concern in cavitation inception analysis simulations of different angles of attack show the numerical method employed here can predict the trend of the flow variation on different operating conditions and therefore is a proper tool for design purposes if the computational cost can be managed note however that a lower resolution than suggested here gives a different ranking between conditions the comparison of iles and ldkm results clarifies that both of these les models can provide very accurate tip vortex flow predictions the predicted velocity distributions at different sections downstream of the foil and pressure distribution and axial velocity along the tip vortex trajectory are compared and found to be very similar the ldkm results also predict very high turbulent kinetic energy at the vortex core even though the high value of turbulent kinetic energy in the vortex core has been reported also by experimental measurements it is believed that this high turbulent kinetic energy is related to the high turbulent production at the vortex core resulted from high velocity spatial gradients in this region the cavitation inception study by the bubble dynamic approach shows a strong dependency of the inception point on the nuclei size it is found that as the nuclei radius is increased the inception point tends towards the minimum pressure criterion which corresponds to the weak water measurements the prediction of the inception for small nuclei sizes i e 2 μ m has good agreement with the strong water measurements of inception the dependency of cavitation inception prediction by bubble dynamic approach on the nuclei size suggests that for accurate tip vortex cavitation inception prediction it is necessary to determine the size of nuclei that can be captured and sucked into the vortex core region and therefore accurate prediction of inception by r p approach would benefit from the coupled bubble and flow simulations mesh resolution requirements for cavitating tip vortex flows are clarified to be lower than wet tip vortex simulations it is found that presence of cavitation increases the tip vortex diameter consequently leading to lower grid points requirements the comparison of the predicted cavitating tip vortex diameter with the experimental measurements for a few conditions shows that the numerical approach can accurately predict the trend the numerical simulations also provide the velocity distribution inside the vortex cavity which was not possible to get during the experimental measurements due to the extra light exposure the numerical results presented in this paper clearly show the capability of the numerical approach in predicting tip vortex flow in both wet and cavitating conditions excellent agreements are found between the numerical predictions and the experimental measurements of the velocity field at different sections downstream of the foil also implying an accurate prediction of the pressure field the study also emphasizes

22249,the paper discussed the effects of pore water pressure and unloading ratio on the mechanical properties of soft soils the shenzhen marine sedimentary soft soils were selected in this study the results revealed that the excess pore water pressures had significant weakening effects on the unloading strength of soft soils comparing with the unloading strength without excess pore water pressure the reduction rate of unloading strengths at excess pore water pressure ranging from 20 to 60 kpa were found to be 3 4 21 4 and 1 3 19 2 for unloading ratio 0 0 and 0 5 respectively meanwhile the excess pore water pressures had greater impact to cohesion than to internal friction angle the unloading failure modes of soft soils are sudden and concealed and the lower confining pressures and higher excess pore water pressures can make the unloading failure more destructive moreover the initial unloading modulus is linearly proportional to the confining pressure but linearly inversely proportional to the excess pore water pressure keywords excess pore water pressure soft soil unloading mechanic stress path 1 introduction marine sedimentary soft soils are widely distributed in coastal areas with low strength high compressibility high sensitivity and significant rheological engineering characteristics which bring many technical problems to the excavation and deformation controls of soft soils foundation pit engineering the excavation of marine sedimentary soft soils is a typical unloading project cai et al 2018 huang et al 2019 the design calculation and numerical analysis of the soil strength parameters for those soft soils were normally obtained by axial loading tests however the effects of lateral unloading stress paths were ignored meanwhile a high level of groundwater usually existed in the coastal areas and the excess pore water pressure will be generated due to the construction vibration load of large construction equipment li 2012 the excess pore water pressures can reduce the effective stress of soft soil particles and weaken the structure of soil particles which can aggravate the unloading damage of soft soils therefore studies on the effects of unloading stress paths and excess pore water pressures on unloading mechanical properties of soft soils are indispensable previous studies were mainly focused on the strength and deformation characteristics of soft soils under the loading stress path and those strength parameters were widely used in the design of unloading excavation and numerical simulation of soft soils zhang et al 2015 used the soil parameters under loading conditions as the input of modified cambridge model to analyze the mechanical properties of the viaduct piers under unloading conditions ni et al 2018 conducted a plane strain loading and unloading comparison tests in silty clay and used those strength parameters for the deformation calculation of the underground continuous wall above studies concluded that the numerical simulation results calculated from soil parameters under loading condition were generally smaller than actual ones some researches on the unloading mechanical properties of soft soils have been reported the stress strain relationships of soft soils were demonstrated to be affected by the stress paths zeng et al 1988 liu and hou 1997 the triaxial undrained tests of soft soils in the pearl river delta were studied by zhou and chen 2009 they reported that the creep effects of soil samples under lateral unloading condition was significantly higher than that under axial loading condition zheng et al 2008 conducted the unloading tests at different unloading ratios and stress paths in tianjin silty clay their results indicated that the unloading ratios directly determined the magnitude and deformation of soil strain zhou 2013 conducted conventional triaxial shear tests and unloading direct shear tests in guangzhou soft soils the test results showed that the strength and initial unloading modulus of soils at unloading path were less than that at loading path respectively lim and ou 2017 reported that under the undrained conditions the unloading mechanical parameters of soft soils can accurately calculate the excavation deformations of the foundation pit the above studies indicated that the mechanical parameters of soft soils at unloading path will better reflect the actual conditions however most of them used direct shear tests which failed to reflect the three dimensional stress state of the soil samples the triaxial test of soft soils at unloading path is still sparse the unloading mechanical parameters of soft soils obtained from triaxial tests can be used for engineering design calculations and numerical simulation analysis of soft soil foundation pits in addition to being affected by the lateral unloading stress path the unloading strength of soft soils is also strongly influenced by the excess pore water pressure cui et al 2017 zhang et al 2004 monitored the pore water pressure at the envelope structure on the runyang bridge and pointed out that the vibration of the external load will generate excess pore water pressure li et al 2011 studied the variations of pore water pressure at clay subgrade during dynamic vibration of construction and indicated that the dissipation time of excess pore water pressure is 20 40 h wei et al 2012 studied the distribution law of excess pore water pressure in soft soils caused by shield construction results showed that the excess pore water pressures are between 21 2 and 56 12 kpa wang and sun 2004 studied the distribution law of excess pore water pressure caused by piling construction and reported that excess pore water pressures are about 43 67 kpa the above studies have concluded that the excess pore water pressure existed in practical engineering however the effects of excess pore water pressure on the unloading mechanical properties of soft soils were never reported with one exception that yan et al 2016 studied the triaxial tensile test of soft soils the excess pore water pressure may change the unloading mechanical parameters which are directly used for the engineering design calculation therefore studies on the effect the excess pore water pressure on the unloading mechanical properties of soft soils are necessary the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of excess pore water pressure and unloading ratio on the unloading mechanical properties of soft soils the data are important to providing theoretical guidance for the excavation of soft soils and can further lay the foundation for the numerical simulation analysis of soft soils unloading creep 2 materials and methods 2 1 soft soils the soils used in this study are from a foundation pit in shenzhen china the sampling depth is 13 5 m the physical properties of the soils including density ρ moisture content ꞷ specific gravity gs liquid limit wl plastic limit wp undrain cohesion c and frictional angle ϕ were measured and results are given in table 1 the physical properties of soft soils were determined by astm standards methods including astm standard d4318 astm d854 meanwhile the used soil is classified as lean clay cl based on uscs classification system the oven dried soil samples were passed through a us no 18 sieve 1 mm openings the soil was then mixed with water to achieve 25 moisture content the soil samples were compacted into a mold with a height of 80 0 mm and diameter of 39 1 mm through a standard compaction protocol the sieve analysis method was used to determining the particle composition of the selected soils and the particle size distribution curve was shown in fig 1 it is clearly seen that the soft soils are mainly composed of fine particles wherein the fine particle contents particle size less than 0 075 mm are 96 1 and the clay contents particle size less than 0 005 mm are 64 1 2 2 unloading ratios and unloading stress paths the stress paths experienced by the soil unit in each part of the soft soil foundation pit are complicated for the convenience of this experiment vhr is used to represent different unloading stress paths where vh represents vertical and horizontal unloading and unloading ratio r represents the ratio of absolute value of vertical stress unloading δσ1 to absolute value of horizontal stress unloading δσ3 which is r δσ1 δσ3 under the k0 consolidation condition the unloading compression failure occurs in the soil when the unloading ratio r is less or equal to 1 the unloading elongation failure happens when r is higher than 1 zheng et al 2008 this study mainly focused on the unloading compression failure of the selected soils therefore unloading ratios of 0 0 0 5 and 1 0 were selected in this experiment moreover vh0 0 corresponds to the unloading stress path experienced by point a fig 2 that is the vertical stress is constant and the horizontal stress is gradually reduced vh0 5 and vh1 0 correspond to the stress paths experienced by points b and c respectively that is the ratio of vertical unloading and horizontal unloading are 0 5 and 1 0 respectively 2 3 experimental procedures 2 3 1 saturation the pore water pressure valve upper drain valve and back pressure valve lower drain valve of the triaxial instrument were closed firstly and then the confining pressure 20 kpa was applied to soil samples the pore water pressure on the pore pressure sensor was read when the value was stable after that the back pressure valve was opened to apply back pressure to the soil samples and the confining pressure was applied in stages after the pore water pressures were stabilized the next level of confining pressure and back pressure were applied the increment of each confining pressure and back pressure is 30 kpa when the confining pressure is 110 kpa and the back pressure is 90 kpa the skempton s b value calculated from each pore water pressure increment is 0 95 which indicates that soil samples are saturated the desired saturation degree achieved after 24 h and the used soft soils are disturbed soils with a 25 moisture content 2 3 2 consolidation the three different consolidation confining pressures σ 3c 100 200 and 300 kpa were applied in this study the corresponding axial pressures σ 1c 189 377 and 566 kpa were respectively applied to restore the sample as undisturbed state after that the upper drain valve of the triaxial instrument was opened to perform k0 k 0 1 sin ϕ 0 53 drainage consolidation on the soil samples 2 3 3 excess pore water pressure the excess pore water pressure u0 refers to the excess pore water pressure applied by the triaxial instrument back pressure system after consolidation and before the unloading tests the excess pore water pressures were found to be 17 64 kpa in the constructions of soft soils in shenzhen china wei et al 2012 therefore four different excess pore water pressures u0 0 20 40 and 60 kpa were applied in this experiment to study the unloading mechanical properties of soft soils as shown in fig 3 2 3 4 unloading strength tests soil samples were unloaded by horizontal and vertical stresses along the vh0 0 vh0 5 and vh1 0 stress paths the detailed unloading stress path tests were summarized in table 2 for vh0 0 unloading path σ 1 remain same during the unloading test while σ 3 is reducing with 0 02 kpa min unloading rate in vh0 5 unloading path σ 1 and σ 3 decrease with 0 01 kpa min and 0 02 kpa min unloading rate respectively for vh1 0 unloading path σ 1 and σ 3 both decrease with a rate of 0 02 kpa min 2 3 5 data collection the axial pressures confining pressures axial deformations and pore water pressures were recorded until the axial strains reached 15 3 results and discussion 3 1 deviatoric stress strain curves fig 4 shows the relationships between deviatoric stress and axial strain at different confining pressures 200 and 300 kpa and unloading ratios 0 0 and 0 5 in general the stress strain curves of the soil samples under unloading conditions have no essential difference compared with that under axial loading condition reported by wang et al 2013 when the confining pressure increases the initial slopes of the deviatoric stress strain curves become steeper indicating an increase of initial unloading modulus meanwhile the stress strain curve exhibit strain hardening this is in agreement with the results reported by zheng et al 2008 however liu and hou 1997 found that the stress strain curve of soft soils exhibit stain softening which is opposite to the results in this study this could be due to that the consolidation drainage test was conducted in their experiment from fig 4 a and c it can be seen that unloading ratios will affect the unloading strength of soft soils the higher unloading ratios the lower unloading strengths when the strain is around 1 the corresponding deviatoric stress accounts for 70 83 of the unloading strength which indicated that the axial strain is small in early stage unloading process when the strain is 2 3 the strain of soft soils suddenly becomes larger and gradually increases until soil samples damage the above phenomenon indicates that the unloading failure mode of soft soils is sudden and concealed and the greater excess pore water pressure will cause unloading failure to be more sudden therefore in the construction process of soft soil foundation pits the deformation of the foundation pits should be closely monitored to prevent the unloading failure from happening suddenly and the methods of reducing the groundwater level or diverting the groundwater should be used to avoid the excess pore water pressure caused by the construction vibration 3 2 unloading strengths the deviatoric stress strain curves in fig 4 generally do not have peaks the deviatoric stresses keep increasing as the strains increase indicating a strain hardening therefore it is not easy to affirm the damage points liu and hou 1997 pointed out that the deviatoric stress strain curves can be expressed in double logarithmic coordinates and the deviatoric stress strain is in a straight line segment with two distinct turning points this study chooses the last turning point as the breaking point of the unloading strength the unloading strengths of soft soils at different confining pressures and excess pore water pressures were shown in fig 5 it can be found that the unloading strength of soft soils decreases with increase of excess pore water pressure indicating that the excess pore water pressure has a significant weakening effect on the unloading strength of soft soils comparing with the unloading strength without excess pore water pressure the reduction rate of unloading strengths at excess pore water pressure ranging from 20 to 60 kpa were found to be 3 4 21 4 and 1 3 19 2 for vh0 0 and vh0 5 respectively the highest slope is found in the vh0 0 stress path and 100 kpa confining pressure it is clearly seen that the slope decreases with the increase of confining pressure and unloading ratio this indicates that the unloading strength of soft soils at low confining pressure and unloading ratio decreases faster than that at higher confining pressure and unloading ratio 3 3 unloading strength parameters the strength envelopes at different unloading stress path are shown in fig 6 and the corresponding unloading strength parameters are summarized in table 3 it can be seen from fig 6 that under the same unloading stress paths the envelopes of the total stress intensity at different excess pore water pressures are almost parallel indicating that the internal friction angle remains constant but the cohesion decreases as the excess pore water pressure increases the studies by zhuang et al 2007 and sun et al 2013 on tests of silty clay also reported the similar results moreover under the same excess pore water pressure the cohesion of soft soils decreases with the increase of unloading ratios but the friction angle increases slightly with the increase of unloading ratios table 3 this result is slightly different from the finding by zhang et al 2017 this could be due to that they applied consolidation drainage tests on soft soils 3 4 confining pressure strain curves the stress strain characteristics focused on the vh0 0 and vh0 5 unloading stress paths since the vh1 0 stress path indicates that the vertical stress and horizontal stress are simultaneously unloaded and the deviatoric stress always remains unchanged therefore the deviatoric stress strain curve cannot be drawn at vh1 0 stress path the unloading characteristics of soft soils at vh1 0 stress path are analyzed by confining pressure strain curves as shown in fig 7 under the same confining pressure the axial strains generated by soils increase with the increase of excess pore water pressures indicating that the excess pore water pressures have a significant weakening effect on the unloading strength of soft soils meanwhile given the same excess pore water pressure the deviatoric stresses at the unloading failure of soft soils increase with the increase of confining pressures therefore increasing confining pressure of soft soils will contribute to delaying the unloading failure of soft soils the soil samples at vh1 0 stress path are subject to compression failure as shown in fig 8 in the initial stage of unloading the soil samples have a certain rebound displacement in the axial direction with further process of unloading the molar stress circles are closer to the damage envelope and the deformations of soil samples increase sharply until the shear fails zheng et al 2008 conducted unloading tests at different unloading ratios r 0 1 2 4 and in tianjin marine sedimentary silty clay they reported that the unloading ratio r 1 is the critical point between compression and extension failure of soil samples as shown in fig 9 this is slightly different with our results this could be due to that they applied isotropic consolidation on soil samples 3 5 analysis of initial unloading modulus the initial unloading modulus e0 is an important parameter for numerical analysis of soft soil foundation pits it is calculated by normalization of stress strain curves of soft soils the tangential modulus strain relationship can be further obtained from the equation 1 kondner 1963 1 ε σ 1 σ 3 a ε b there is a linear relationship between ε σ 1 σ 3 and strain ε the intercept and slope of this straight line are a and b respectively it can be deduced that the soil ultimate strength is 1 a and the initial unloading modulus is 1 b to eliminate influences of initial solidification stress difference σ 1 c σ 3 c on normalization results during k 0 solidification σ 1 σ 3 is subtracted by σ 1 c σ 3 c here therefore eq 1 can be rewritten as 2 ε σ 1 σ 3 σ 1 c σ 3 c a ε b in the case of vh0 0 and vh0 5 stress paths the normalized stress strain curves at 300 kpa confining pressure are drawn according to eq 2 as shown in fig 10 it is found that all curves at different excess pore water pressures show good linear relations this proves that eq 2 can normalize test results well all parameters including a b initial modulus and soil ultimate strength are obtained through the normalized stress strain curve and are summarized in table 4 it can be seen from table 4 that at same unloading stress paths and confining pressures the initial unloading modulus of soft soils decreases with the increase of excess pore water pressures given the same confining pressures and excess pore water pressures the initial unloading modulus of soil samples at vh0 5 stress path is lower than that at vh0 0 stress path this is consistent with the results in the unloading strengths meanwhile it is found from fig 11 that the initial unloading modulus reduces slightly while the excess pore water pressure ranges from 0 to 20 kpa but it decreases sharply as excess pore water pressure is between 20 and 40 kpa this result suggests that the unloading failure of soil samples will happen when the excess pore water pressure ranges from 20 to 40 kpa the certain value of excess pore water pressure needs to be further studied the initial unloading modulus of soil samples presents a linear growth with the increase of confining pressures as shown in fig 12 xiong et al 2013 found the similar conclusion as excess pore water pressure is 0 kpa the initial unloading modulus of soil samples at vh0 0 and vh0 5 stress path are 12 62 mpa and 10 75 mpa respectively this is similar with what xiong et al 2013 reported that the corresponding unloading modulus is 15 mpa while the confining pressure is 100 kpa 4 conclusions a series of undrained triaxial unloading tests on marine sedimentary soft soils at different unloading ratios and excess pore water pressures were studied the excess pore water pressure had significant weakening effects on the unloading strength parameters of soft soils suggesting that considering excess pore water pressure in practical engineering is needed meanwhile comparing with the unloading strength without excess pore water pressure the reduction rate of unloading strengths at excess pore water pressure ranging from 20 to 60 kpa were found to be 3 4 21 4 and 1 3 19 2 for vh0 0 and vh0 5 respectively moreover the excess pore water pressures had greater weakening degree to cohesion than to internal friction angle the confining pressure showed a positive effect on the initial unloading modulus of soft soils and the initial unloading modulus of soil samples at vh0 5 stress path was lower than that at vh0 0 stress path these reported unloading strength parameters and unloading modulus in this study can be used for engineering design calculations and numerical simulation analysis of soft soil foundation pits acknowledgments this research was funded by the national natural science foundation of china

groundwater usually existed in the coastal areas and the excess pore water pressure will be generated due to the construction vibration load of large construction equipment li 2012 the excess pore water pressures can reduce the effective stress of soft soil particles and weaken the structure of soil particles which can aggravate the unloading damage of soft soils therefore studies on the effects of unloading stress paths and excess pore water pressures on unloading mechanical properties of soft soils are indispensable previous studies were mainly focused on the strength and deformation characteristics of soft soils under the loading stress path and those strength parameters were widely used in the design of unloading excavation and numerical simulation of soft soils zhang et al 2015 used the soil parameters under loading conditions as the input of modified cambridge model to analyze the mechanical properties of the viaduct piers under unloading conditions ni et al 2018 conducted a plane strain loading and unloading comparison tests in silty clay and used those strength parameters for the deformation calculation of the underground continuous wall above studies concluded that the numerical simulation results calculated from soil parameters under loading condition were generally smaller than actual ones some researches on the unloading mechanical properties of soft soils have been reported the stress strain relationships of soft soils were demonstrated to be affected by the stress paths zeng et al 1988 liu and hou 1997 the triaxial undrained tests of soft soils in the pearl river delta were studied by zhou and chen 2009 they reported that the creep effects of soil samples under lateral unloading condition was significantly higher than that under axial loading condition zheng et al 2008 conducted the unloading tests at different unloading ratios and stress paths in tianjin silty clay their results indicated that the unloading ratios directly determined the magnitude and deformation of soil strain zhou 2013 conducted conventional triaxial shear tests and unloading direct shear tests in guangzhou soft soils the test results showed that the strength and initial unloading modulus of soils at unloading path were less than that at loading path respectively lim and ou 2017 reported that under the undrained conditions the unloading mechanical parameters of soft soils can accurately calculate the excavation deformations of the foundation pit the above studies indicated that the mechanical parameters of soft soils at unloading path will better reflect the actual conditions however most of them used direct shear tests which failed to reflect the three dimensional stress state of the soil samples the triaxial test of soft soils at unloading path is still sparse the unloading mechanical parameters of soft soils obtained from triaxial tests can be used for engineering design calculations and numerical simulation analysis of soft soil foundation pits in addition to being affected by the lateral unloading stress path the unloading strength of soft soils is also strongly influenced by the excess pore water pressure cui et al 2017 zhang et al 2004 monitored the pore water pressure at the envelope structure on the runyang bridge and pointed out that the vibration of the external load will generate excess pore water pressure li et al 2011 studied the variations of pore water pressure at clay subgrade during dynamic vibration of construction and indicated that the dissipation time of excess pore water pressure is 20 40 h wei et al 2012 studied the distribution law of excess pore water pressure in soft soils caused by shield construction results showed that the excess pore water pressures are between 21 2 and 56 12 kpa wang and sun 2004 studied the distribution law of excess pore water pressure caused by piling construction and reported that excess pore water pressures are about 43 67 kpa the above studies have concluded that the excess pore water pressure existed in practical engineering however the effects of excess pore water pressure on the unloading mechanical properties of soft soils were never reported with one exception that yan et al 2016 studied the triaxial tensile test of soft soils the excess pore water pressure may change the unloading mechanical parameters which are directly used for the engineering design calculation therefore studies on the effect the excess pore water pressure on the unloading mechanical properties of soft soils are necessary the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of excess pore water pressure and unloading ratio on the unloading mechanical properties of soft soils the data are important to providing theoretical guidance for the excavation of soft soils and can further lay the foundation for the numerical simulation analysis of soft soils unloading creep 2 materials and methods 2 1 soft soils the soils used in this study are from a foundation pit in shenzhen china the sampling depth is 13 5 m the physical properties of the soils including density ρ moisture content ꞷ specific gravity gs liquid limit wl plastic limit wp undrain cohesion c and frictional angle ϕ were measured and results are given in table 1 the physical properties of soft soils were determined by astm standards methods including astm standard d4318 astm d854 meanwhile the used soil is classified as lean clay cl based on uscs classification system the oven dried soil samples were passed through a us no 18 sieve 1 mm openings the soil was then mixed with water to achieve 25 moisture content the soil samples were compacted into a mold with a height of 80 0 mm and diameter of 39 1 mm through a standard compaction protocol the sieve analysis method was used to determining the particle composition of the selected soils and the particle size distribution curve was shown in fig 1 it is clearly seen that the soft soils are mainly composed of fine particles wherein the fine particle contents particle size less than 0 075 mm are 96 1 and the clay contents particle size less than 0 005 mm are 64 1 2 2 unloading ratios and unloading stress paths the stress paths experienced by the soil unit in each part of the soft soil foundation pit are complicated for the convenience of this experiment vhr is used to represent different unloading stress paths where vh represents vertical and horizontal unloading and unloading ratio r represents the ratio of absolute value of vertical stress unloading δσ1 to absolute value of horizontal stress unloading δσ3 which is r δσ1 δσ3 under the k0 consolidation condition the unloading compression failure occurs in the soil when the unloading ratio r is less or equal to 1 the unloading elongation failure happens when r is higher than 1 zheng et al 2008 this study mainly focused on the unloading compression failure of the selected soils therefore unloading ratios of 0 0 0 5 and 1 0 were selected in this experiment moreover vh0 0 corresponds to the unloading stress path experienced by point a fig 2 that is the vertical stress is constant and the horizontal stress is gradually reduced vh0 5 and vh1 0 correspond to the stress paths experienced by points b and c respectively that is the ratio of vertical unloading and horizontal unloading are 0 5 and 1 0 respectively 2 3 experimental procedures 2 3 1 saturation the pore water pressure valve upper drain valve and back pressure valve lower drain valve of the triaxial instrument were closed firstly and then the confining pressure 20 kpa was applied to soil samples the pore water pressure on the pore pressure sensor was read when the value was stable after that the back pressure valve was opened to apply back pressure to the soil samples and the confining pressure was applied in stages after the pore water pressures were stabilized the next level of confining pressure and back pressure were applied the increment of each confining pressure and back pressure is 30 kpa when the confining pressure is 110 kpa and the back pressure is 90 kpa the skempton s b value calculated from each pore water pressure increment is 0 95 which indicates that soil samples are saturated the desired saturation degree achieved after 24 h and the used soft soils are disturbed soils with a 25 moisture content 2 3 2 consolidation the three different consolidation confining pressures σ 3c 100 200 and 300 kpa were applied in this study the corresponding axial pressures σ 1c 189 377 and 566 kpa were respectively applied to restore the sample as undisturbed state after that the upper drain valve of the triaxial instrument was opened to perform k0 k 0 1 sin ϕ 0 53 drainage consolidation on the soil samples 2 3 3 excess pore water pressure the excess pore water pressure u0 refers to the excess pore water pressure applied by the triaxial instrument back pressure system after consolidation and before the unloading tests the excess pore water pressures were found to be 17 64 kpa in the constructions of soft soils in shenzhen china wei et al 2012 therefore four different excess pore water pressures u0 0 20 40 and 60 kpa were applied in this experiment to study the unloading mechanical properties of soft soils as shown in fig 3 2 3 4 unloading strength tests soil samples were unloaded by horizontal and vertical stresses along the vh0 0 vh0 5 and vh1 0 stress paths the detailed unloading stress path tests were summarized in table 2 for vh0 0 unloading path σ 1 remain same during the unloading test while σ 3 is reducing with 0 02 kpa min unloading rate in vh0 5 unloading path σ 1 and σ 3 decrease with 0 01 kpa min and 0 02 kpa min unloading rate respectively for vh1 0 unloading path σ 1 and σ 3 both decrease with a rate of 0 02 kpa min 2 3 5 data collection the axial pressures confining pressures axial deformations and pore water pressures were recorded until the axial strains reached 15 3 results and discussion 3 1 deviatoric stress strain curves fig 4 shows the relationships between deviatoric stress and axial strain at different confining pressures 200 and 300 kpa and unloading ratios 0 0 and 0 5 in general the stress strain curves of the soil samples under unloading conditions have no essential difference compared with that under axial loading condition reported by wang et al 2013 when the confining pressure increases the initial slopes of the deviatoric stress strain curves become steeper indicating an increase of initial unloading modulus meanwhile the stress strain curve exhibit strain hardening this is in agreement with the results reported by zheng et al 2008 however liu and hou 1997 found that the stress strain curve of soft soils exhibit stain softening which is opposite to the results in this study this could be due to that the consolidation drainage test was conducted in their experiment from fig 4 a and c it can be seen that unloading ratios will affect the unloading strength of soft soils the higher unloading ratios the lower unloading strengths when the strain is around 1 the corresponding deviatoric stress accounts for 70 83 of the unloading strength which indicated that the axial strain is small in early stage unloading process when the strain is 2 3 the strain of soft soils suddenly becomes larger and gradually increases until soil samples damage the above phenomenon indicates that the unloading failure mode of soft soils is sudden and concealed and the greater excess pore water pressure will cause unloading failure to be more sudden therefore in the construction process of soft soil foundation pits the deformation of the foundation pits should be closely monitored to prevent the unloading failure from happening suddenly and the methods of reducing the groundwater level or diverting the groundwater should be used to avoid the excess pore water pressure caused by the construction vibration 3 2 unloading strengths the deviatoric stress strain curves in fig 4 generally do not have peaks the deviatoric stresses keep increasing as the strains increase indicating a strain hardening therefore it is not easy to affirm the damage points liu and hou 1997 pointed out that the deviatoric stress strain curves can be expressed in double logarithmic coordinates and the deviatoric stress strain is in a straight line segment with two distinct turning points this study chooses the last turning point as the breaking point of the unloading strength the unloading strengths of soft soils at different confining pressures and excess pore water pressures were shown in fig 5 it can be found that the unloading strength of soft soils decreases with increase of excess pore water pressure indicating that the excess pore water pressure has a significant weakening effect on the unloading strength of soft soils comparing with the unloading strength without excess pore water pressure the reduction rate of unloading strengths at excess pore water pressure ranging from 20 to 60 kpa were found to be 3 4 21 4 and 1 3 19 2 for vh0 0 and vh0 5 respectively the highest slope is found in the vh0 0 stress path and 100 kpa confining pressure it is clearly seen that the slope decreases with the increase of confining pressure and unloading ratio this indicates that the unloading strength of soft soils at low confining pressure and unloading ratio decreases faster than that at higher confining pressure and unloading ratio 3 3 unloading strength parameters the strength envelopes at different unloading stress path are shown in fig 6 and the corresponding unloading strength parameters are summarized in table 3 it can be seen from fig 6 that under the same unloading stress paths the envelopes of the total stress intensity at different excess pore water pressures are almost parallel indicating that the internal friction angle remains constant but the cohesion decreases as the excess pore water pressure increases the studies by zhuang et al 2007 and sun et al 2013 on tests of silty clay also reported the similar results moreover under the same excess pore water pressure the cohesion of soft soils decreases with the increase of unloading ratios but the friction angle increases slightly with the increase of unloading ratios table 3 this result is slightly different from the finding by zhang et al 2017 this could be due to that they applied consolidation drainage tests on soft soils 3 4 confining pressure strain curves the stress strain characteristics focused on the vh0 0 and vh0 5 unloading stress paths since the vh1 0 stress path indicates that the vertical stress and horizontal stress are simultaneously unloaded and the deviatoric stress always remains unchanged therefore the deviatoric stress strain curve cannot be drawn at vh1 0 stress path the unloading characteristics of soft soils at vh1 0 stress path are analyzed by confining pressure strain curves as shown in fig 7 under the same confining pressure the axial strains generated by soils increase with the increase of excess pore water pressures indicating that the excess pore water pressures have a significant weakening effect on the unloading strength of soft soils meanwhile given the same excess pore water pressure the deviatoric stresses at the unloading failure of soft soils increase with the increase of confining pressures therefore increasing confining pressure of soft soils will contribute to delaying the unloading failure of soft soils the soil samples at vh1 0 stress path are subject to compression failure as shown in fig 8 in the initial stage of unloading the soil samples have a certain rebound displacement in the axial direction with further process of unloading the molar stress circles are closer to the damage envelope and the deformations of soil samples increase sharply until the shear fails zheng et al 2008 conducted unloading tests at different unloading ratios r 0 1 2 4 and in tianjin marine sedimentary silty clay they reported that the unloading ratio r 1 is the critical point between compression and extension failure of soil samples as shown in fig 9 this is slightly different with our results this could be due to that they applied isotropic consolidation on soil samples 3 5 analysis of initial unloading modulus the initial unloading modulus e0 is an important parameter for numerical analysis of soft soil foundation pits it is calculated by normalization of stress strain curves of soft soils the tangential modulus strain relationship can be further obtained from the equation 1 kondner 1963 1 ε σ 1 σ 3 a ε b there is a linear relationship between ε σ 1 σ 3 and strain ε the intercept and slope of this straight line are a and b respectively it can be deduced that the soil ultimate strength is 1 a and the initial unloading modulus is 1 b to eliminate influences of initial solidification stress difference σ 1 c σ 3 c on normalization results during k 0 solidification σ 1 σ 3 is subtracted by σ 1 c σ 3 c here therefore eq 1 can be rewritten as 2 ε σ 1 σ 3 σ 1 c σ 3 c a ε b in the case of vh0 0 and vh0 5 stress paths the normalized stress strain curves at 300 kpa confining pressure are drawn according to eq 2 as shown in fig 10 it is found that all curves at different excess pore water pressures show good linear relations this proves that eq 2 can normalize test results well all parameters including a b initial modulus and soil ultimate strength are obtained through the normalized stress strain curve and are summarized in table 4 it can be seen from table 4 that at same unloading stress paths and confining pressures the initial unloading modulus of soft soils decreases with the increase of excess pore water pressures given the same confining pressures and excess pore water pressures the initial unloading modulus of soil samples at vh0 5 stress path is lower than that at vh0 0 stress path this is consistent with the results in the unloading strengths meanwhile it is found from fig 11 that the initial unloading modulus reduces slightly while the excess pore water pressure ranges from 0 to 20 kpa but it decreases sharply as excess pore water pressure is between 20 and 40 kpa this result suggests that the unloading failure of soil samples will happen when the excess pore water pressure ranges from 20 to 40 kpa the certain value of excess pore water pressure needs to be further studied the initial unloading modulus of soil samples presents a linear growth with the increase of confining pressures as shown in fig 12 xiong et al 2013 found the similar conclusion as excess pore water pressure is 0 kpa the initial unloading modulus of soil samples at vh0 0 and vh0 5 stress path are 12 62 mpa and 10 75 mpa respectively this is similar with what xiong et al 2013 reported that the corresponding unloading modulus is 15 mpa while the confining pressure is 100 kpa 4 conclusions a series of undrained triaxial unloading tests on marine sedimentary soft soils at different unloading ratios and excess pore water pressures were studied the excess pore water pressure had significant weakening effects on the unloading strength parameters of soft soils suggesting that considering excess pore water pressure in practical engineering is needed meanwhile comparing with the unloading strength without excess pore water pressure the reduction rate of unloading strengths at excess pore water pressure ranging from 20 to 60 kpa were found to be 3 4 21 4 and 1 3 19 2 for vh0 0 and vh0 5 respectively moreover the excess pore water pressures had greater weakening degree to cohesion than to internal friction angle the confining pressure showed a positive effect on the initial unloading modulus of soft soils and the initial unloading modulus of soil samples at vh0 5 stress path was lower than that at vh0 0 stress path these reported unloading strength parameters and unloading modulus in this study can be used for engineering design calculations and numerical simulation analysis of soft soil foundation pits acknowledgments this research was funded by the national natural science foundation of china
