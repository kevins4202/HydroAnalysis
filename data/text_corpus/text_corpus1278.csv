6390,complex interactions among organic contaminant soil and water change the electrical properties of the subsurface often causing strong self potential sp anomalies whose monitoring is proposed as a useful tool to determine the temporal evolution of the contaminant plumes in the present study we focus on the problem of organic contaminant transport related to olive oil mill wastes oomws which represent an important environmental problem in mediterranean countries the diffusion of the contaminants into the subsurface is studied by using a global optimization procedure on sp data measured at different times in a well studied contaminated pilot area located next to the keritis river in western crete island greece despite the complex hydrogeological conditions related to the proximity to both the keritis river and a small seasonal stream the analysis of five sp datasets acquired along the same profile shows that the proposed hybrid genetic price algorithm is able to reproduce the main features of the sp signals thus identifying probable multiple sp anomaly sources and their changes over time in particular preferential horizontal pathways of oomw and their migration in the vadose zone during the summer season were identified providing some useful insights for future planning of remediation actions keywords organic contaminated soil self potential monitoring global optimization contamination source identification 1 introduction from last few decades the use of the self potential sp method has been increasing in both hydrogeophysical and environmental problems revil and jardani 2013 and references therein several studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting and monitoring the flow of contaminants in the subsurface e g atekwana et al 2006 atekwana and slater 2009 revil et al 2010 heenan et al 2015 guarracino and jougnot 2018 soldi et al 2019 applications of sp have been presented for characterization of organic rich contaminant plumes due to landfill leachate naudet et al 2004 arora et al 2007 dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapl contamination detection minsley et al 2007 żogala et al 2012 monitoring environmental degradation due to waste disposal corwin and butler 1989 corwin 1990 moreira et al 2013 and crude oil contamination giampaolo et al 2014 due to the complexity of contaminant soil water interactions and the variety of charge polarization mechanisms that can cause anomalies in sp signals the quantitative interpretation of sp data for mapping polluted areas in the subsoil is an open challenging issue in the last decades many sp data inversion techniques have been proposed to detect the spatial distribution of organic rich contaminated plumes some authors for example have suggested a sp data inversion procedure based on removal of the streaming potential component from the collected sp signal and the use of a linear relationship between the source current density and the redox potential gradient naudet et al 2003 2004 linde and revil 2007 arora et al 2007 jouniaux et al 2009 several approaches search for sp anomalous sources by computing cross correlation integrals that give information on more probable electric charge accumulation zones di maio and patella 1994 patella 1997 revil et al 2001 iuliano et al 2001 jardani et al 2007 mauri et al 2010 di maio et al 2016a while other methods estimate the depth of presumed sp sources by using spectral analyses das and agarwal 2012 rani et al 2015 di maio et al 2017 or attempt for a full characterization of polarized structures through more sophisticated statistical procedures like bayesian approach jardani et al 2009 least squares and optimization algorithms abdelrahman et al 2008 essa 2011 göktürkler and balkaya 2012 srivastava et al

annealing tlas and asfahani 2008 biswas and sharma 2014 in the present study a first attempt has been made for the interpretation of sp anomalies related to oomws by a hybrid genetic price algorithm gpa which has been recently proposed for quantitative interpretation of single and multiple sp anomaly sources di maio et al 2016b 2019 oomw is a water soluble multi phase dark coloured liquid produced by olive oil extraction processes it generally contains both organic mainly phenols and polyphenols 700 mg kg and inorganic compounds potassium and phosphorus in different concentrations depending on many factors such as soil chemistry agronomic practices oil extraction processes boukana et al 2014 disposing of oomw usually takes place by spreading oomw to agricultural soils or by storing oomw in artificial usually unprotected ponds and waiting for its natural evaporation in the latter case the evaporation is very slow and oomw infiltration can cause significant environmental pollution that compromises the soil and groundwater quality the effect of oomw infiltration in the soil consists mainly in carbonate dissolution changing in electrical resistivity distribution seferou et al 2013 ntarlagiannis et al 2016 simyrdanis et al 2018 modifications in phenolic compounds nutrient contents and ph values as well as in biological activity sierra et al 2001 kavvadias et al 2010 kavvadias et al 2011 the sp data analysed in this paper have been acquired in an area located at south western part of crete island greece hosting an evaporation pond which is used for oomws deposition since 1940 following the seasonal pattern of olive oil production the waste is deposited every year from november to april and then letting it to evaporate from march to late october dry period once it has remained solid waste it is dug out the shoddy construction of the pond often results into overflow or leakage of wastewater due to local geological conditions e g permeable sediments or fractured bedrocks shallow aquifer etc which increase the potential for groundwater contamination and soil degradation to define the contamination state of the subsurface field geophysical surveys electrical resistivity tomography ert and induced polarization ip as well as resistivity laboratory measurements spectral induced polarization sip were performed papadopoulos and chatziathanasiou 2011 seferou et al 2013 papadopoulos et al 2014 kirmizakis 2016 ntarlagiannis et al 2016 simyrdanis et al 2018 in addition analysis of geochemical samples was accomplished kavvadias et al 2010 doula et al 2013 mekki et al 2013 kavvadias et al 2017 to quantify the geophysical findings the geophysical study presented here aims to estimate the effectiveness of sp measurements for contaminant transport monitoring by analyzing the results of five sp surveys conducted along the same profile in proximity of the pond site ntarlagiannis et al 2016 simyrdanis et al 2018 to interpret the measured sp signals the proposed gpa approach is used which has the advantage to consider a multiple source model without any initial assumption on the shape of the causative sources to strengthen the sp signals analysis ert data acquired along a profile nearly coincident with the sp survey line have been also taken into account in the following the collected geophysical data are presented and after a brief description of the gpa algorithm the results of its application are discussed in terms of possible correlations with oomw contamination and monitoring of its temporal evolution 2 materials and methods 2 1 test site the study area is an open unprotected waste pond used for oomw deposition in the keritis river basin near alikianos village located in western crete island greece fig 1 a the border area of the basin is covered by quaternary pleistocene holocene deposits and sediments miocene that expand to ne se and sw of the alikianos village the test site is mainly composed of alluvial deposits with variable hydraulic permeability which primarily consist of loose sandy clayed material terra rossa red clay soil with rounded and angular pebbles in small internal basins and alluvial mantle material kanta et al 2013 as concerns the hydrogeological conditions measurements acquired for more than five years from 97 observation points boreholes and wells over a broader study area have shown that the depth of the groundwater table is highly variable karstic aquifer from a minimum of 0 85 m to a maximum of 12 2 m and a mean value of about 11 4 m nikolaidis and karatzas 2006 kanta et al 2013 ntarlagiannis et al 2016 it should be mentioned that none of the aforementioned observation points are close to the test site sessional observations of the groundwater level gwl from a deep 5 m pit which was about 10 m away the survey line suggest that the gwl is at 3 m with a sessional variation over a period of 3 years of about 20 cm the study area is bounded by the keritis river to the north and a small temporary depending on the intensity and frequency of rainfalls flow stream to the east as it is shown in fig 1b based on visual evidence and results of time lapse ert measurements it is believed that gwl change is minimal due to the close proximity to the stream whose water level fluctuations are very small ntarlagiannis et al 2016 furthermore estimations of aquifer hydraulic parameters in the keritis basin have been obtained from numerous hydrogeological and geophysical measurements in particular based on the results of 21 vertical electrical soundings soupios et al 2007 formation factor and porosity values were retrieved at several locations the use of kozeny carman bear equation provided an average value of the hydraulic conductivity of about 2 67 10 4 m s from which transmissivity values of the phreatic aquifer ranging from 312 m2 day to 1308 m2 day were found soupios et al 2007 ntarlagiannis et al 2016 2 2 oomw properties oomw is a water soluble liquid that presents high chemical and biochemical oxygen demand cod 50 180 g l and bod 40 95 g l respectively in particular doula et al 2013 have proposed eight soil parameters as appropriate indicators for oomw disposal areas i e electrical conductivity ph polyphenols organic matter total n exchangeable k available p and available fe on the basis of laboratory analyses of soil samples for the geochemical characterization of the study area four soil profiles p1 p4 red circles in fig 1b located on the outside and around the down slope of the evaporation pond were excavated 2 m wide and 2 5 m deep p1 and p4 were excavated on the western and eastern part of the pond respectively while p2 and p3 were excavated on the north side of the pond along the ert line 1 fig 1b and between the keritis river banks and the disposal site on the downslope of the pond kavvadias et al 2017 collected soil and liquid samples from the waste pond and the surrounding pits an average value of the characteristics of oomw obtained from five field campaigns over a period of 3 years is given in table 1 kavvadias et al 2017 clearly indicate that the data along the soil profiles show changes in soil chemical properties outside the evaporation pond due to infiltration of oomw especially soil profile p2 showed the highest ph values in deeper soil layers indicating its greater influence by oomw transportation and the highest exchangeable k content across soil horizons indicating downward transportation of significant k amounts from evaporation pond to soil profile p2 levels of organic matter in soil were reduced with soil depth at all sampling points except that for soil profile p3 where high values were constantly measured up to 130 cm soil depth indicating transport of organic oomw load finally a significant concentration of heavy metals was observed which contributed to the increase of the electrical conductivity values 2 3 geoelectrical data acquisition time lapse geoelectrical surveys consisting of electrical resistivity tomography and self potential were performed along the red and yellow parallel profiles shown in fig 1b 2 3 1 sp monitoring the self potential data were measured along a profile of length 33 m yellow line in fig 1b which is normal to the presumed direction of the contaminant movement soupios and karaoulis 2015 the basic equipment consisted of non polarized pb pbcl electrodes and digital high impedance multimeter fluke 289 true rms industrial logging with sensibility of 0 1 mv sp data were collected by the fixed base station acquisition technique using 23 electrodes with an inter electrode spacing of 1 5 m the base electrode was installed very carefully after choosing a proper area avoiding locations with cultural animal or human disturbances and far from metallic pipelines boreholes fences and other sources of noise all electrodes were covered by isolated materials to prevent the electrodes from temperature and air circulation effects a standard procedure to install the electrodes and to acquire reliable and accurate measurements was followed corry et al 1983 the installation of the sp array was realized at the begging of april 2014 and the first dataset was acquired four weeks later a total five datasets were collected from may to july 2014 2 3 2 ert monitoring over the same period to better characterize the electrical properties of the investigated subsoil electrical resistivity data were independently acquired along a profile parallel to the sp profile ert line 1 in fig 1b erts were performed utilizing a single channel resistivity meter to achieve the optimum spatial and in depth resolution data from two different configurations dipole dipole and wenner schlumberger with 48 electrodes and 1 m electrode spacing simyrdanis et al 2014 were collected error analysis was also performed analysing forward and reciprocal acquired data the measurements were repeated four times during the period from april to july 2014 the ert data were pre processed to filter the outliers which had very low or high apparent resistivity values due to low injection current or poor contact with the ground 2 4 the sp data inversion approach to quantitatively interpret the observed sp signals shown in fig 2 polarized structures with simple geometries like sphere cylinders sheets are assumed to be the active sources of the sp signal the challenge consists in finding the best choice for the parameters that characterize location depth and shape of the sources in the present study the algorithm used for the inversion of the sp data is the genetic price algorithm gpa recently introduced by di maio et al 2016b for a full characterization of sp anomaly sources gpa combines controlled random search with genetic algorithm approach for searching optimal values of the source parameters in a multi parameter model space and it is found to be competitive with respect to others global optimization approaches like very fast simulated annealing di maio et al 2019 specifically gpa finds the best solutions by minimizing an objective function that is defined by the following equation 1 σ p 2 1 n m i 1 n v ip λ v i 2 where n is the number of experimental data m is the number of parameters v ip λ and vi are the outputs of the model corresponding to the forward functions for a given set of parameters λ and the observed sp values respectively considering a model with a number s of polarized bodies the electrical potential vp at any point p x along the measurement profile is given by the following equation yüngül 1950 bhattacharya and roy 1981 agarwal and srivastava 2009 2 v p x j 1 s k j x x 0 j cos θ j z 0 j sin θ j x x 0 j 2 z 0 j 2 p where kj is the electric dipole moment x0j and z0j are the horizontal position of the center axis of the j th source and its depth respectively θj is the polarization angle measured clockwise between polarization and horizontal axes and p is the shape factor which is 1 5 1 and 0 5 in case of sphere horizontal and vertical cylinder respectively according to eq 2 each sp source depends on five parameters k x0 z0 θ p and variations in their values are expected if changes in shape location and depth of the sp source occur over time in particular changes in the values of p are expected if preferential flow pathways change direction while changes over time in the values of x and z give information on possible lateral shifts and ascent or deepening of the main flow direction respectively finally in case of changes only in flow intensity variations in k are expected we notice that before applying gpa the five datasets collected for the sp profile have been carefully up sampled using spline interpolation to increase the data points for the inversion process without disturbing the real shape of the experimental curve 3 results 3 1 qualitative interpretation of sp data fig 2a shows the results of the five repeated sp surveys along the yellow profile in fig 1b during the period from may to july 2014 as it can be seen on may 15 a wide minimum in sp values centered at about 25 m along the horizontal axis is observed characterized by a relatively small amplitude about 10 mv except for a narrow positive anomaly in the western part of the profile no other significant peaks are visible along the entire profile on the contrary from the middle of june till the end of july last three profiles in fig 2a the minimum in sp signal narrows and increases in amplitude reaching negative values of about 20 mv and moving slightly to the west while positive peaks are displayed to the eastern and western part of such a minimum the most intense peak about 53 mv in amplitude is found east of the minimum in the range between the progressives 25 30 m along the horizontal axis while smaller positive peaks superimposed on a growing trend to west are observed in the summer season a qualitative interpretation of the highlighted sp anomalies can be attempted taking into account the different mechanisms that cause natural electric potentials as it is well known in contaminated areas the observed sp values mainly depend on electrokinetic and electrochemical components naudet et al 2003 2004 linde and revil 2007 the electrokinetic component is controlled by the fluid pressure gradient and the streaming current coupling coefficient related to the so called zeta potential hunter 1981 revil et al 1999 the electrochemical component is controlled by the diffusion potential leinov and jackson 2014 maineult et al 2004 originated by ionic concentration gradients and the membrane potential observable mainly in low permeability rocks however some studies in contaminated area by naudet et al 2003 2004 and jouniaux et al 2009 stated that redox potential can also contribute to the generation of sp electrochemical component as oomw is a water soluble liquid the observed sp signal is expected to be the overlapping of both electrokinetic and electrochemical mechanisms that may occur in combination usually a wide minimum in the sp signal is associated to an underground water flow perpendicular to the direction of the measurement profile bolève et al 2007 richards et al 2010 thus we consider a fluid flow from the pond to the river as responsible for the observed sp minimum approximatively at the center of the profile whose amplitude increases in the summer season due to a presumable increase of the electrochemical contribution which arises due to temperature gradient as suggested by leinov and jackson 2014 on the other side we interpret the increasing trend in sp values to west as a horizontal flow parallel to the keritis river flow direction and relate the positive sp peaks in the summer season to probable increases in ion concentration gradients as supported by several studies and laboratory investigations bolève et al 2007 ikard et al 2012 titov et al 2012 giampaolo et al 2014 they have shown that oil content decreases with time due to biodegradation processes ntougias et al 2013 which lead to a decrease of the soil porosity and to an increase of the pore water salinity titov et al 2012 this increase in salinity increases the concentration gradients and make the effect of electro diffusion potential more significant jougnot et al 2015 the growth of oil biodegraders in partially water saturated oil contaminated soils reduces consequently the hydraulic conductivity atekwana and atekwana 2010 revil et al 2010 as well as the electrical resistivity values this reduction causes the decrease of the electrokinetic coupling coefficient giving rise to the positive sp anomaly which is considered index of potential contamination spreading and in situ microbial activity this qualitative interpretation of sp data has been also validated by the ert tomographies fig 2b performed during the period from april to july 2014 along a profile ert 1 in fig 1b nearly coincident with the sp survey line the acquired ert data were inverted by the dc2dpro inversion software kim 2009 and a rms misfit error generally less than 5 0 resulted for the 2d inverted models as it can be seen the resistivity distribution shows an upper resistive layer more than 500 ωm that extends down to about 3 m below ground level b g l which can be correlated with sand and gravel materials according to the results of an extensive ert prospecting performed in the survey area simyrdanis et al 2014 2018 it is worth noticing that the interface between the resistive and the underlying conductive layer appears substantially continuous in the earlier profiles of 30 april and 04 june while it is increasingly discontinuous during the summer season as shown in the last two profiles below the shallow resistive layer a complex pattern of the resistivity distribution is apparent in particular the low resistivity anomalies characterized by values of 20 ωm indicate parallel preferential flow horizontal pathways in the north down gradient direction i e towards the keritis river normal to the ert and sp measurement profiles likely induced by the dynamical conditions of the small stream indicated in fig 1b at deeper depth patches of low resistivity values highlight a conductive pathway thorough the underlying bedrock characterized by resistivity values greater than 200 ωm 3 2 quantitative interpretation of sp data with genetic price algorithm being the overall behavior of the sp curves very complex the numerical analyses were aimed at reproducing only the main features of such curves the gpa analysis has been performed first considering a two source model and then repeated by using a three source model a further increase in the number of sources was not considered because even if it might improve the curve fitting the number of the model parameters becomes too large to find statistically significant solutions in the following results obtained from both the multi source models are discussed 3 2 1 two source model in the attempt to identify the main anomaly sources of the sp signals of fig 2a a model with two polarized structures is first assumed and the best solutions for the source parameters are searched by minimizing eq 1 in which eq 2 with s 2 is used it is worth noting that the gpa inversion method does not require any assumption on the set of variables k x0 z0 θ and p and only initial ranges for such parameters are needed to constrain the solution research as little as possible wide ranges for the initial choice of the source parameters are used which are indicated by red and blue dashed lines on the distance axis of fig 3 a as shown the selected ranges for the initial values of the model parameters extend over almost the entire profile with a small overlap around 25 m table 2 summarizes the optimal values of the source parameters obtained from gpa analysis and fig 3a shows the sp data and the gpa curves interestingly the algorithm provides for all five datasets a value of the shape factor p very close to 1 0 indicating horizontal cylinder shaped structures as the most probable sources supporting the hypothesis of horizontal flow pathways perpendicular to the sp profile as concerns the position of the two potential sources gpa distinguishes the earliest dataset from the others as it can be seen in table 2 for the data acquired in may the proposed inversion procedure localizes the first source at about 12 m along the profile at a depth of about 7 m this feature agrees with the ert data acquired at the end of april fig 2b which show a wide conductive zone in the western part of the profile as concerns the second sp source it origins the minimum at about 25 m along the profile and it is found slightly moving to the west in the successive inversions in good agreement with the resistivity measurements that show an approximately central conductive body that seems to extend westward with summer approaching it is worth noting that for the last ert survey 04 aug see fig 2b the resistivity distribution shows a more complex pattern in the eastern part of the profile with several conductive nuclei located at different depths although the simplicity of the assumed model also in this case the algorithm is able to reproduce the sp minimum and the intense positive peak in the observed sp signal by recognizing the top of the widely conductive area at 5 m b g l we note that in all the profiles except the earliest the inversion method locates the second possible sp anomaly source to east of the minimum and at shallower depths since this source causes positive peaks in the sp signals acquired in the summer season it can be correlated to an upward flow migration likely ascribable to the occurrence of ion concentration gradients related to the biodegradation processes of oomw fluid finally we notice that the source in the central sector is characterized by an overall increasing trend of k with approaching the summer such a finding agrees with the interpretation of an increase in ion concentration gradients which would cause a lowering of resistivity and an increasing of sp values see fig 2 3 2 2 three source model to characterize the main features observed in the western part of the profile which are not reproduced by the two source model except for the earliest dataset the gpa method has been further applied by considering three anomalous sources for this analysis the objective function is given by eq 1 where the forward function is provided by eq 2 with s 3 interestingly the application of gpa has given again values of the shape factor p very close to 1 0 table 3 for all the three sources further confirming the interpretation of the anomalies as horizontal flow pathways fig 3b shows the comparison between observed sp data and gpa curves for the three source model as it can be seen the reconstruction of the sp signal is significantly improved for at least three cases i e sp surveys performed on 6 june 20 june and 28 july in particular beside the two sp sources identified before the inversion algorithm is able to locate the third anomaly source at about 12 14 m along the distance axis where the resistivity tomographies show a highly conductive body see fig 2b as concerns the retrieved values for the electrical dipole moments also for this modeling the highest k values result from the inversions of sp data in the summer season supporting the interpretation of an increasing contribution of ion concentrations gradients to the sp signal it is worth noticing that over the summer in the north western sector of the profile the sp curves develop more complex behaviors with positive peaks that overlap with negative slope trends which could suggest trend of deepening water tables as also indicated by linde et al 2011 such a complex hydrology is not modeled by our simple approach but it is found in some way reflected in the values of the parameters of the western source which for the survey in early july it is characterized by the largest value of k and the deepest value of depth z0 in the attempt to describe the temporal evolution of the anomaly source responsible for the occurrence of the largest positive peaks in the sp signal see fig 2a its depth values provided by the gpa analysis are reported in fig 4 as a function of the acquisition date of the sp signals for the two considered models interestingly both the two and three source models find a non monotonic behavior of z0 characterized by a decreasing trend until to the beginning of july and a slight increase during the following twenty days the results of the gpa analysis suggest that the potentially contaminated flow passes through the vadose zone 3 m b g l in june reaching its lowest depth at the beginning of july finally for better identifying the resistivity structures and sp sources fig 5 combines the ert acquired on 04 august fig 5a and the sp profile acquired on 28 july fig 5b together with the two gpa results obtained by using two and three source model respectively in both cases the inversion algorithm identifies the main sp anomaly source likely related to the oomw contamination to the east of the central sp minimum in the region characterized by low resistivity values as it is also apparent in the previous surveys 08 july in fig 2 for the case of the three source model gpa is also able to identify the main anomaly source in the western sector that is characterized as a shallow horizontal pathway of contaminated fluid which well correlates with the shallow low resistivity body in fig 5a 4 conclusions the results of five repeated self potential measurements along a profile close to an oomw evaporation pond are reported and analyzed in the attempt to better characterize the temporal evolution of the contamination level of the area the test site is adjacent to a small stream and close to the main river of chania western crete therefore the complex hydrogeological conditions are expected to control the electrical response of the investigated soil volume which has been characterized also by taking into account four repeated ert measurements carried out along a profile parallel to the sp one to invert the sp data and identify possible anomaly sources associated with contaminated fluid paths a global optimization approach based on a hybrid genetic price algorithm has been applied by using two and three source models gpa approach has been able to recognize a horizontal pathway of fluid propagation characterized by low values in resistivity and sp data which is located approximately in the central part of the profile in spring and slightly moving to west during the summer season moreover the inversion algorithm has reproduced the main positive sp peaks observed in the eastern and western part of the profile which have been characterized as horizontal pathways of potentially contaminated fluids likely related to biodegradation processes of oomw responsible for lowering of resistivity values at shallower depth from the gpa analysis the depth of the anomaly source accountable for the highest peak in the sp signal is found to continuously decrease during the spring season until to reach the shallowest depth in the unsaturated zone at the beginning of july in conclusion although the simplicity of the assumed models the gpa analysis has been able to characterize the main features of the sp signals describing the temporal evolution of possible contamination sources confirming the sp method as useful tool for monitoring soil and groundwater contamination status also in complex hydrogeological areas declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the authors are very

et al 2010 doula et al 2013 mekki et al 2013 kavvadias et al 2017 to quantify the geophysical findings the geophysical study presented here aims to estimate the effectiveness of sp measurements for contaminant transport monitoring by analyzing the results of five sp surveys conducted along the same profile in proximity of the pond site ntarlagiannis et al 2016 simyrdanis et al 2018 to interpret the measured sp signals the proposed gpa approach is used which has the advantage to consider a multiple source model without any initial assumption on the shape of the causative sources to strengthen the sp signals analysis ert data acquired along a profile nearly coincident with the sp survey line have been also taken into account in the following the collected geophysical data are presented and after a brief description of the gpa algorithm the results of its application are discussed in terms of possible correlations with oomw contamination and monitoring of its temporal evolution 2 materials and methods 2 1 test site the study area is an open unprotected waste pond used for oomw deposition in the keritis river basin near alikianos village located in western crete island greece fig 1 a the border area of the basin is covered by quaternary pleistocene holocene deposits and sediments miocene that expand to ne se and sw of the alikianos village the test site is mainly composed of alluvial deposits with variable hydraulic permeability which primarily consist of loose sandy clayed material terra rossa red clay soil with rounded and angular pebbles in small internal basins and alluvial mantle material kanta et al 2013 as concerns the hydrogeological conditions measurements acquired for more than five years from 97 observation points boreholes and wells over a broader study area have shown that the depth of the groundwater table is highly variable karstic aquifer from a minimum of 0 85 m to a maximum of 12 2 m and a mean value of about 11 4 m nikolaidis and karatzas 2006 kanta et al 2013 ntarlagiannis et al 2016 it should be mentioned that none of the aforementioned observation points are close to the test site sessional observations of the groundwater level gwl from a deep 5 m pit which was about 10 m away the survey line suggest that the gwl is at 3 m with a sessional variation over a period of 3 years of about 20 cm the study area is bounded by the keritis river to the north and a small temporary depending on the intensity and frequency of rainfalls flow stream to the east as it is shown in fig 1b based on visual evidence and results of time lapse ert measurements it is believed that gwl change is minimal due to the close proximity to the stream whose water level fluctuations are very small ntarlagiannis et al 2016 furthermore estimations of aquifer hydraulic parameters in the keritis basin have been obtained from numerous hydrogeological and geophysical measurements in particular based on the results of 21 vertical electrical soundings soupios et al 2007 formation factor and porosity values were retrieved at several locations the use of kozeny carman bear equation provided an average value of the hydraulic conductivity of about 2 67 10 4 m s from which transmissivity values of the phreatic aquifer ranging from 312 m2 day to 1308 m2 day were found soupios et al 2007 ntarlagiannis et al 2016 2 2 oomw properties oomw is a water soluble liquid that presents high chemical and biochemical oxygen demand cod 50 180 g l and bod 40 95 g l respectively in particular doula et al 2013 have proposed eight soil parameters as appropriate indicators for oomw disposal areas i e electrical conductivity ph polyphenols organic matter total n exchangeable k available p and available fe on the basis of laboratory analyses of soil samples for the geochemical characterization of the study area four soil profiles p1 p4 red circles in fig 1b located on the outside and around the down slope of the evaporation pond were excavated 2 m wide and 2 5 m deep p1 and p4 were excavated on the western and eastern part of the pond respectively while p2 and p3 were excavated on the north side of the pond along the ert line 1 fig 1b and between the keritis river banks and the disposal site on the downslope of the pond kavvadias et al 2017 collected soil and liquid samples from the waste pond and the surrounding pits an average value of the characteristics of oomw obtained from five field campaigns over a period of 3 years is given in table 1 kavvadias et al 2017 clearly indicate that the data along the soil profiles show changes in soil chemical properties outside the evaporation pond due to infiltration of oomw especially soil profile p2 showed the highest ph values in deeper soil layers indicating its greater influence by oomw transportation and the highest exchangeable k content across soil horizons indicating downward transportation of significant k amounts from evaporation pond to soil profile p2 levels of organic matter in soil were reduced with soil depth at all sampling points except that for soil profile p3 where high values were constantly measured up to 130 cm soil depth indicating transport of organic oomw load finally a significant concentration of heavy metals was observed which contributed to the increase of the electrical conductivity values 2 3 geoelectrical data acquisition time lapse geoelectrical surveys consisting of electrical resistivity tomography and self potential were performed along the red and yellow parallel profiles shown in fig 1b 2 3 1 sp monitoring the self potential data were measured along a profile of length 33 m yellow line in fig 1b which is normal to the presumed direction of the contaminant movement soupios and karaoulis 2015 the basic equipment consisted of non polarized pb pbcl electrodes and digital high impedance multimeter fluke 289 true rms industrial logging with sensibility of 0 1 mv sp data were collected by the fixed base station acquisition technique using 23 electrodes with an inter electrode spacing of 1 5 m the base electrode was installed very carefully after choosing a proper area avoiding locations with cultural animal or human disturbances and far from metallic pipelines boreholes fences and other sources of noise all electrodes were covered by isolated materials to prevent the electrodes from temperature and air circulation effects a standard procedure to install the electrodes and to acquire reliable and accurate measurements was followed corry et al 1983 the installation of the sp array was realized at the begging of april 2014 and the first dataset was acquired four weeks later a total five datasets were collected from may to july 2014 2 3 2 ert monitoring over the same period to better characterize the electrical properties of the investigated subsoil electrical resistivity data were independently acquired along a profile parallel to the sp profile ert line 1 in fig 1b erts were performed utilizing a single channel resistivity meter to achieve the optimum spatial and in depth resolution data from two different configurations dipole dipole and wenner schlumberger with 48 electrodes and 1 m electrode spacing simyrdanis et al 2014 were collected error analysis was also performed analysing forward and reciprocal acquired data the measurements were repeated four times during the period from april to july 2014 the ert data were pre processed to filter the outliers which had very low or high apparent resistivity values due to low injection current or poor contact with the ground 2 4 the sp data inversion approach to quantitatively interpret the observed sp signals shown in fig 2 polarized structures with simple geometries like sphere cylinders sheets are assumed to be the active sources of the sp signal the challenge consists in finding the best choice for the parameters that characterize location depth and shape of the sources in the present study the algorithm used for the inversion of the sp data is the genetic price algorithm gpa recently introduced by di maio et al 2016b for a full characterization of sp anomaly sources gpa combines controlled random search with genetic algorithm approach for searching optimal values of the source parameters in a multi parameter model space and it is found to be competitive with respect to others global optimization approaches like very fast simulated annealing di maio et al 2019 specifically gpa finds the best solutions by minimizing an objective function that is defined by the following equation 1 σ p 2 1 n m i 1 n v ip λ v i 2 where n is the number of experimental data m is the number of parameters v ip λ and vi are the outputs of the model corresponding to the forward functions for a given set of parameters λ and the observed sp values respectively considering a model with a number s of polarized bodies the electrical potential vp at any point p x along the measurement profile is given by the following equation yüngül 1950 bhattacharya and roy 1981 agarwal and srivastava 2009 2 v p x j 1 s k j x x 0 j cos θ j z 0 j sin θ j x x 0 j 2 z 0 j 2 p where kj is the electric dipole moment x0j and z0j are the horizontal position of the center axis of the j th source and its depth respectively θj is the polarization angle measured clockwise between polarization and horizontal axes and p is the shape factor which is 1 5 1 and 0 5 in case of sphere horizontal and vertical cylinder respectively according to eq 2 each sp source depends on five parameters k x0 z0 θ p and variations in their values are expected if changes in shape location and depth of the sp source occur over time in particular changes in the values of p are expected if preferential flow pathways change direction while changes over time in the values of x and z give information on possible lateral shifts and ascent or deepening of the main flow direction respectively finally in case of changes only in flow intensity variations in k are expected we notice that before applying gpa the five datasets collected for the sp profile have been carefully up sampled using spline interpolation to increase the data points for the inversion process without disturbing the real shape of the experimental curve 3 results 3 1 qualitative interpretation of sp data fig 2a shows the results of the five repeated sp surveys along the yellow profile in fig 1b during the period from may to july 2014 as it can be seen on may 15 a wide minimum in sp values centered at about 25 m along the horizontal axis is observed characterized by a relatively small amplitude about 10 mv except for a narrow positive anomaly in the western part of the profile no other significant peaks are visible along the entire profile on the contrary from the middle of june till the end of july last three profiles in fig 2a the minimum in sp signal narrows and increases in amplitude reaching negative values of about 20 mv and moving slightly to the west while positive peaks are displayed to the eastern and western part of such a minimum the most intense peak about 53 mv in amplitude is found east of the minimum in the range between the progressives 25 30 m along the horizontal axis while smaller positive peaks superimposed on a growing trend to west are observed in the summer season a qualitative interpretation of the highlighted sp anomalies can be attempted taking into account the different mechanisms that cause natural electric potentials as it is well known in contaminated areas the observed sp values mainly depend on electrokinetic and electrochemical components naudet et al 2003 2004 linde and revil 2007 the electrokinetic component is controlled by the fluid pressure gradient and the streaming current coupling coefficient related to the so called zeta potential hunter 1981 revil et al 1999 the electrochemical component is controlled by the diffusion potential leinov and jackson 2014 maineult et al 2004 originated by ionic concentration gradients and the membrane potential observable mainly in low permeability rocks however some studies in contaminated area by naudet et al 2003 2004 and jouniaux et al 2009 stated that redox potential can also contribute to the generation of sp electrochemical component as oomw is a water soluble liquid the observed sp signal is expected to be the overlapping of both electrokinetic and electrochemical mechanisms that may occur in combination usually a wide minimum in the sp signal is associated to an underground water flow perpendicular to the direction of the measurement profile bolève et al 2007 richards et al 2010 thus we consider a fluid flow from the pond to the river as responsible for the observed sp minimum approximatively at the center of the profile whose amplitude increases in the summer season due to a presumable increase of the electrochemical contribution which arises due to temperature gradient as suggested by leinov and jackson 2014 on the other side we interpret the increasing trend in sp values to west as a horizontal flow parallel to the keritis river flow direction and relate the positive sp peaks in the summer season to probable increases in ion concentration gradients as supported by several studies and laboratory investigations bolève et al 2007 ikard et al 2012 titov et al 2012 giampaolo et al 2014 they have shown that oil content decreases with time due to biodegradation processes ntougias et al 2013 which lead to a decrease of the soil porosity and to an increase of the pore water salinity titov et al 2012 this increase in salinity increases the concentration gradients and make the effect of electro diffusion potential more significant jougnot et al 2015 the growth of oil biodegraders in partially water saturated oil contaminated soils reduces consequently the hydraulic conductivity atekwana and atekwana 2010 revil et al 2010 as well as the electrical resistivity values this reduction causes the decrease of the electrokinetic coupling coefficient giving rise to the positive sp anomaly which is considered index of potential contamination spreading and in situ microbial activity this qualitative interpretation of sp data has been also validated by the ert tomographies fig 2b performed during the period from april to july 2014 along a profile ert 1 in fig 1b nearly coincident with the sp survey line the acquired ert data were inverted by the dc2dpro inversion software kim 2009 and a rms misfit error generally less than 5 0 resulted for the 2d inverted models as it can be seen the resistivity distribution shows an upper resistive layer more than 500 ωm that extends down to about 3 m below ground level b g l which can be correlated with sand and gravel materials according to the results of an extensive ert prospecting performed in the survey area simyrdanis et al 2014 2018 it is worth noticing that the interface between the resistive and the underlying conductive layer appears substantially continuous in the earlier profiles of 30 april and 04 june while it is increasingly discontinuous during the summer season as shown in the last two profiles below the shallow resistive layer a complex pattern of the resistivity distribution is apparent in particular the low resistivity anomalies characterized by values of 20 ωm indicate parallel preferential flow horizontal pathways in the north down gradient direction i e towards the keritis river normal to the ert and sp measurement profiles likely induced by the dynamical conditions of the small stream indicated in fig 1b at deeper depth patches of low resistivity values highlight a conductive pathway thorough the underlying bedrock characterized by resistivity values greater than 200 ωm 3 2 quantitative interpretation of sp data with genetic price algorithm being the overall behavior of the sp curves very complex the numerical analyses were aimed at reproducing only the main features of such curves the gpa analysis has been performed first considering a two source model and then repeated by using a three source model a further increase in the number of sources was not considered because even if it might improve the curve fitting the number of the model parameters becomes too large to find statistically significant solutions in the following results obtained from both the multi source models are discussed 3 2 1 two source model in the attempt to identify the main anomaly sources of the sp signals of fig 2a a model with two polarized structures is first assumed and the best solutions for the source parameters are searched by minimizing eq 1 in which eq 2 with s 2 is used it is worth noting that the gpa inversion method does not require any assumption on the set of variables k x0 z0 θ and p and only initial ranges for such parameters are needed to constrain the solution research as little as possible wide ranges for the initial choice of the source parameters are used which are indicated by red and blue dashed lines on the distance axis of fig 3 a as shown the selected ranges for the initial values of the model parameters extend over almost the entire profile with a small overlap around 25 m table 2 summarizes the optimal values of the source parameters obtained from gpa analysis and fig 3a shows the sp data and the gpa curves interestingly the algorithm provides for all five datasets a value of the shape factor p very close to 1 0 indicating horizontal cylinder shaped structures as the most probable sources supporting the hypothesis of horizontal flow pathways perpendicular to the sp profile as concerns the position of the two potential sources gpa distinguishes the earliest dataset from the others as it can be seen in table 2 for the data acquired in may the proposed inversion procedure localizes the first source at about 12 m along the profile at a depth of about 7 m this feature agrees with the ert data acquired at the end of april fig 2b which show a wide conductive zone in the western part of the profile as concerns the second sp source it origins the minimum at about 25 m along the profile and it is found slightly moving to the west in the successive inversions in good agreement with the resistivity measurements that show an approximately central conductive body that seems to extend westward with summer approaching it is worth noting that for the last ert survey 04 aug see fig 2b the resistivity distribution shows a more complex pattern in the eastern part of the profile with several conductive nuclei located at different depths although the simplicity of the assumed model also in this case the algorithm is able to reproduce the sp minimum and the intense positive peak in the observed sp signal by recognizing the top of the widely conductive area at 5 m b g l we note that in all the profiles except the earliest the inversion method locates the second possible sp anomaly source to east of the minimum and at shallower depths since this source causes positive peaks in the sp signals acquired in the summer season it can be correlated to an upward flow migration likely ascribable to the occurrence of ion concentration gradients related to the biodegradation processes of oomw fluid finally we notice that the source in the central sector is characterized by an overall increasing trend of k with approaching the summer such a finding agrees with the interpretation of an increase in ion concentration gradients which would cause a lowering of resistivity and an increasing of sp values see fig 2 3 2 2 three source model to characterize the main features observed in the western part of the profile which are not reproduced by the two source model except for the earliest dataset the gpa method has been further applied by considering three anomalous sources for this analysis the objective function is given by eq 1 where the forward function is provided by eq 2 with s 3 interestingly the application of gpa has given again values of the shape factor p very close to 1 0 table 3 for all the three sources further confirming the interpretation of the anomalies as horizontal flow pathways fig 3b shows the comparison between observed sp data and gpa curves for the three source model as it can be seen the reconstruction of the sp signal is significantly improved for at least three cases i e sp surveys performed on 6 june 20 june and 28 july in particular beside the two sp sources identified before the inversion algorithm is able to locate the third anomaly source at about 12 14 m along the distance axis where the resistivity tomographies show a highly conductive body see fig 2b as concerns the retrieved values for the electrical dipole moments also for this modeling the highest k values result from the inversions of sp data in the summer season supporting the interpretation of an increasing contribution of ion concentrations gradients to the sp signal it is worth noticing that over the summer in the north western sector of the profile the sp curves develop more complex behaviors with positive peaks that overlap with negative slope trends which could suggest trend of deepening water tables as also indicated by linde et al 2011 such a complex hydrology is not modeled by our simple approach but it is found in some way reflected in the values of the parameters of the western source which for the survey in early july it is characterized by the largest value of k and the deepest value of depth z0 in the attempt to describe the temporal evolution of the anomaly source responsible for the occurrence of the largest positive peaks in the sp signal see fig 2a its depth values provided by the gpa analysis are reported in fig 4 as a function of the acquisition date of the sp signals for the two considered models interestingly both the two and three source models find a non monotonic behavior of z0 characterized by a decreasing trend until to the beginning of july and a slight increase during the following twenty days the results of the gpa analysis suggest that the potentially contaminated flow passes through the vadose zone 3 m b g l in june reaching its lowest depth at the beginning of july finally for better identifying the resistivity structures and sp sources fig 5 combines the ert acquired on 04 august fig 5a and the sp profile acquired on 28 july fig 5b together with the two gpa results obtained by using two and three source model respectively in both cases the inversion algorithm identifies the main sp anomaly source likely related to the oomw contamination to the east of the central sp minimum in the region characterized by low resistivity values as it is also apparent in the previous surveys 08 july in fig 2 for the case of the three source model gpa is also able to identify the main anomaly source in the western sector that is characterized as a shallow horizontal pathway of contaminated fluid which well correlates with the shallow low resistivity body in fig 5a 4 conclusions the results of five repeated self potential measurements along a profile close to an oomw evaporation pond are reported and analyzed in the attempt to better characterize the temporal evolution of the contamination level of the area the test site is adjacent to a small stream and close to the main river of chania western crete therefore the complex hydrogeological conditions are expected to control the electrical response of the investigated soil volume which has been characterized also by taking into account four repeated ert measurements carried out along a profile parallel to the sp one to invert the sp data and identify possible anomaly sources associated with contaminated fluid paths a global optimization approach based on a hybrid genetic price algorithm has been applied by using two and three source models gpa approach has been able to recognize a horizontal pathway of fluid propagation characterized by low values in resistivity and sp data which is located approximately in the central part of the profile in spring and slightly moving to west during the summer season moreover the inversion algorithm has reproduced the main positive sp peaks observed in the eastern and western part of the profile which have been characterized as horizontal pathways of potentially contaminated fluids likely related to biodegradation processes of oomw responsible for lowering of resistivity values at shallower depth from the gpa analysis the depth of the anomaly source accountable for the highest peak in the sp signal is found to continuously decrease during the spring season until to reach the shallowest depth in the unsaturated zone at the beginning of july in conclusion although the simplicity of the assumed models the gpa analysis has been able to characterize the main features of the sp signals describing the temporal evolution of possible contamination sources confirming the sp method as useful tool for monitoring soil and groundwater contamination status also in complex hydrogeological areas declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the authors are very

6391,in an alluvial river various kinds of river regulation engineering are usually constructed along the reach for the stability of channel regime and the safety of flood control which greatly affects the process of channel evolution therefore a one dimensional 1d morphodynamic model has been improved to simulate the fluvial processes influenced by large scale river regulation works in the refined model each node of a cross section was labeled using a specified point code representing the zones of floodplain and main channel with or without regulation engineering and sediment transport and bed deformation in different zones were treated separately in the zones without regulation engineering both bed deposition and bed erosion were permitted to occur in the zones with regulation works bed deposition was allowed while bed erosion was not permitted to occur owing to the restriction of those engineering unless there was a deposition layer newly formed over the previous simulation period then the improved model was calibrated and verified using field observations through the application to a 347 km long alluvial channel located in the middle yangtze river in china the results for the year 2016 show that the channel scour volume without the effect of river regulation works was 9 greater than the measured value 34 43 106 t while the outcome considering this effect 35 81 106 t was in closer agreement with the measurements moreover the variation in channel geometry obtained from the improved model agreed better with the observed data river regulation works would limit the channel incision and it is likely to scour the other unprotected bed of a cross section or the downstream cross sections as the flow cannot carry enough sediment from the protected bed simulated results indicate that part of the main channel zone at the jing65 section was protected but the riverbed continued to incise by about 0 68 m in the protected area when the effect of bed protection works was not considered in the model which was not in accord with the observed channel geometry therefore this effect of large scale river regulation works on channel evolution needs to be considered for a higher simulation accuracy keywords river regulation works one dimensional morphodynamic model sediment transport bed deformation middle yangtze river 1 introduction in alluvial rivers various kinds of river regulation engineering e g bank protection engineering flow guide works are constructed along the reaches in the world s longest river mississippi river the channel has been stabilized by bank revetment engineering with a 1400 km length which has greatly reduced bank erosion and lateral channel migration kesel 2003 likewise large scale bank protection works were also constructed along the middle and lower yangtze river with the protected bank length of about 1450 km cwrc 2017 moreover a total of 9096 spur dikes and short spurs were constructed in the lower yellow river before 1997 and 323 sites of river regulation works such as levee protection and flow guidance covered a total length of 647 km in this reach wu et al 2005 therefore it is necessary to investigate the influence of river regulation engineering on channel evolution processes common methods for investigations into the effect of river regulation engineering mainly include analysis of field measurements physical river modelling and numerical modelling the method of data analysis can obtain the detailed impacts of river regulation engineering in local zones or reach a qualitative conclusion for a long reach ten brinke et al 1998 surian 1999 kiss et al 2008 2011 nakagawa et al 2013 sarker et al 2014 but it needs many field data that are always unavailable in practice physical river models usually require great space and investment and it is difficult to take a long reach as the study region asaro and paris 2000 giri et al 2004 roca et al 2007 ghodsian and vaghefi 2009 bhuiyan et al 2010 nakagawa et al 2013 quite few researchers attempted to investigate this topic using numerical modelling and previous studies mainly investigated the local influence caused by a specified kind of river regulation engineering including the induced changes in flow structure sediment transport and channel geometry asaro and paris 2000 giri et al 2004 minor et al 2007 nakagawa et al 2013 for example asaro and paris 2000 used a two dimensional 2d model to investigate the effect induced by the construction of a new embankment at the confluence between two rivers giri et al 2004 adopted a 2d numerical model to simulate the depth averaged flow properties turbulent and vorticity fields in a meandering like flume with spurs minor et al 2007 adopted a three dimensional numerical model to examine the turbulent flow field and the associated sediment transport due to a series of barbs in a channel bend and compared the effect of different arrangements of barb groups on channel adjustments it is noted that these models are usually two or three dimensional ones and are difficult to be applied in long reaches due to the limitation of computer time however sometimes it is necessary to understand the overall impacts of these river regulation works on channel evolution especially in a long reach with a mass of regulation works in this study the focus is paid to investigate the effect of bed shoal and bank protection works on channel evolution it is commonly acknowledged that these kinds of large scale regulation works have a particularly significant impact on the processes of sediment transport and bed deformation for example it can limit the degrees of bank retreat and riverbed incision in the protected areas and may aggravate bed deformation downstream of these regions yu and lu 2008 meanwhile many researchers found that the construction of bank revetment engineering changed the flow structure and accelerated near bank deposition rates surian 1999 kiss et al 2008 2011 furthermore these works can not only induce channel adjustments in local regions but also can cause considerable impacts at reach scale especially in a bifurcated reach shoal protection projects implemented on central bars may influence the alternative shifting of its main and secondary branches and consequently change the river regime which is very likely to affect the process of channel deformation at a relatively large scale yu and lu 2008 therefore it is appropriate to investigate the effect of large scale river regulation works on the channel evolution process in a long reach using an improved one dimensional morphodynamic model the jingjiang reach located in the middle yangtze river is selected as the study region because extensive river regulation works have been carried out in this reach moreover the operation of the three gorges dam tgd caused significant channel degradation along this reach and thus more river regulation works were constructed for the stability of channel regime and the safety of flood control the scientific aims of this study are to i improve the existing one dimensional morphodynamic model with the influence of river regulation works on channel adjustments being considered and ii quantitatively compare the processes of sediment transport and bed deformation under two scenarios with and without the effect of river regulation works 2 description of the morphodynamic model 2 1 one dimensional governing equations in the current study the processes of flow and sediment transport and the corresponding bed deformation are described by the one dimensional 1d governing equations deng et al 2019 1 q x b z t q l 2 q t ga α f b q 2 a 2 z x 2 α f q a q x q 2 a 2 a x z g a j f j l ρ l q l u l

hydrodynamic governing equations for flow and the preissmann implicit scheme is used to solve these equations eq 3 is solved by the scheme of explicit upwind difference to simulate the non equilibrium transport process of non uniform suspended sediment eq 4 for the bed deformation is solved using the scheme of explicit difference it should be noted that the present study adopts the same one dimensional governing equations and discrete schemes presented in the study of deng et al 2019 however there exist great differences between these two studies first the aim of the present study is to improve a one dimensional model to consider the influence of large scale river regulation works on channel evolution however the study of deng et al 2019 aimed to develop a coupled model to simulate both bed deformation and bank erosion second the improvements of the morphodynamic 1d model are different in these studies in the present study a one dimensional morphodynamic model was improved in the modules of determination of riverbed boundary condition calculation of sediment transport capacity simulation of sediment transport and bed deformation to investigate the effect of river regulation works however deng et al 2019 integrated a one dimensional morphodynamic model with a two dimensional module of ground water flow and a bank erosion module for the cantilever failure of a composite riverbank to simulate the processes of bed deformation and bank erosion in a long reach 2 2 improvements in the morphodynamic model 2 2 1 determination of riverbed boundary condition the first improvement in the current model is to differentiate the zones of floodplain lips and main channel with and without river regulation works when determining the riverbed boundary condition in the previous models cross sectional profiles are usually used as the initial riverbed boundary condition merely including the distance from the left bank and the corresponding bed level at each node of a cross section in the improved model different zones of a cross section are demarcated by different point codes pc fig 1 first step is to distinguish the floodplain pc 2 and main channel zones pc 3 or pc 0 because a mutation in hydraulic conditions will occur when the water overflows the floodplain lips to achieve it the active floodplain lips of a cross section pc 1 need to be determined and the turning point over which hydraulic conditions will change greatly is regarded as the lip of the active floodplain the main passage between the two lips of the active floodplains on both sides is often defined as the zone of main channel xia et al 2014 the second step is to differentiate the zones with pc 3 and without river regulation works pc 0 because of its significant impacts on the riverbed boundary condition then all the measured cross sectional profiles and the corresponding point codes are used as the riverbed boundary condition in the improved model what s more the channel is usually constituted by deposition movable and unmovable layers successively along the vertical direction with z i j b representing the bed level of a node and z i j 0 representing the bed elevation of a node at the initial time fig 2 deposition layer is a sediment layer newly formed over the previous simulation period and it is assumed that there is no sediment deposition in the protected areas at the initial time the parameter r i is proposed to represent the ratio of the equivalent length of scour permitted riverbed l i q i j p i j q i to the total wetted perimeter p i which means r i l i p i q i j discharge at the j th sub section p i j wetted perimeter at the j th sub section it is determined that bed scour only occurs at the unprotected nodes pc 0 1 2 and the protected nodes with a deposition layer pc 3 and z i j b z i j 0 however it is not permitted at the protected nodes without sediment to be scoured pc 3 and z i j b z i j 0 according to the above mentioned principles the total equivalent length of scour permitted riverbed l i can be determined with the value of r i being further calculated 2 2 2 calculation of sediment transport capacity the second improvement is to amend the calculation method for sediment transport capacity s it is commonly known that the selection of calculation formula for sediment transport capacity and the determination of parameters directly affect the simulation accuracy of bed deformation up to now various semi empirical and semi theoretical formulas have been proposed and used to calculate the sediment transport capacity zhang and zhang 1992 hager 2003 guo et al 2008 rahman et al 2013 tan et al 2018 in the improved model the semi empirical formula proposed by zhang tan et al 2018 is adopted because it is applicable to alluvial rivers carrying low sediment concentrations such as the middle yangtze river in china chen et al 2008 zhou et al 2009 yuan et al 2012 the formula is written in the following form 5 s k 1 u 3 g h ω m m where k 1 coefficient kg m3 m exponent ω m group settling velocity of non uniform suspended sediment m s ω m k 1 n δ p k ω k m 1 m where δ p k is the percentage of the sediment transport capacity for the kth fraction and it can be determined by the approach of li 1987 then the sediment transport capacity for each fraction can be given as s k δ p k s in terms of parameter determination k 1 and m for the yangtze river are usually given as constants in previous studies zhang and xie 1989 zhou et al 2009 yuan et al 2012 but they actually vary in different case studies for example k 1 and m were 0 15 kg m3 and 1 0 respectively in the study of zhou et al 2009 the coefficient k 1 was 0 07 kg m3 and the exponent m was 1 14 in the study of yuan et al 2012 in fact zhang and xie 1989 pointed out that these parameters were related to the variation in a comprehensive parameter of u 3 ghω m fig 3 gives the relationships between k 1 m and u 3 ghω m and these curves were calibrated using the measured flow and sediment data in many quasi equilibrium rivers and laboratory flumes zhang and xie 1989 it is noted that the exponent m decreases generally with the increasing u 3 ghω m and it is almost a constant of about 1 50 when the value of u 3 ghω m is less than 4 0 the coefficient k 1 increases with a larger u 3 ghω m however it is difficult to be determined according to the curves in fig 3 when the value of u 3 ghω m is less than 4 0 e g in the jingjiang reach even though the value of u 3 ghω m is larger than 4 0 the value of k 1 is in the region between two dashed curves and it is still impossible to obtain an accurate result to solve this problem the values of k 1 under different discharges were carefully calibrated in the improved model to guarantee that the calculated suspended sediment concentrations at key hydrometric sections of the study reach agreed with the corresponding measurements then the values of k 1 at other cross sections were obtained by liner interpolation based on the calibrated values at these hydrometric sections furthermore when the water overflows the floodplain lips the mean velocity in section changes little but the average depth will decrease greatly along with a sharp increase in sediment transport capacity which is inconsistent with the fact to solve this problem the sediment transport capacity for the zones of main channel and floodplain s mc and s fp are calculated respectively based on the respective flow conditions then according to the known discharges for main channel and floodplain zones q mc and q fp the total sediment transport capacity at a cross section is calculated by s q mc s mc q fp s fp q mc q fp 2 2 3 improvement in the module of sediment transport the third improvement is to modify the module of sediment transport in this module the section averaged sediment transport capacity s i at the i th section is first calculated based on the aforementioned method since bed scour at a few sections would be restricted by river regulation works s i calculated by eq 5 needs to be modified accordingly to consider this effect the modification details are given as follows i when the calculated section averaged sediment transport capacity s i is smaller than the section averaged suspended sediment concentration s i at the t time bed deposition occurs and it is permitted at all nodes of a cross section therefore s i is still equal to the value of the original calculation s i ii when riverbed suffers scour s i s i the value of s i needs to be revised by the equation of s i s i s i s i r i k 2 under the scenario with the presence of river regulation works the parameter r i represents the ratio of the equivalent length of scour permitted riverbed to the total wetted perimeter which is illustrated in the above section the parameter k2 is a correction coefficient and it is set as k 2 2 r i 1 when the flow cannot obtain sufficient sediment in the zones with river regulation works it may scour the other unprotected nodes at a cross section which causes a larger channel scour intensity at these nodes the correction coefficient k 2 is exactly proposed to consider this influence and its value needs to be greater than 1 this parameter should also be related to the ratio r i when r i 1 the parameter k 2 should be equal to 1 because there are no river regulation works to cause this influence when 0 r i 1 the channel scour intensity at the unprotected nodes will become larger as the value of r i decreases so the parameter k 2 should be negatively correlated with the magnitude of r i to meet the above criterion the correction coefficient k 2 is finally set to 2 r i and it is equal to 2 as the riverbed is totally protected r i 0 moreover it is easily noted that the value of r i is in the range of 0 1 when r i 0 the riverbed is totally protected and not allowed to be scoured at a whole cross section therefore the value of s i is set to s i in order to guarantee that there is no bed deformation at this cross section when r i 1 it means that no river regulation engineering is implemented at the cross section thus bed scour is permitted at the total wetted perimeter and it is not necessary to modify the originally calculated value of s i while 0 r i 1 the riverbed is partly protected and the top priority is to determine the value of r i and then the value of s i can be calculated by s i s i s i s i r i k 2 2 2 4 improvement in the module of bed deformation in terms of bed deformation the deformation area at the i th cross section δ a b i is first calculated by the equation of bed deformation based on the modified value of s i in the previous models without the consideration of river regulation works δ a b i is usually allocated averagely or according to the unit length discharge at each sub section q i j in the modified module the allocation pattern varies in different situations when bed deposition occurs δ a b i is allocated among all nodes of a cross section when it suffers erosion δ a b i is merely distributed among the unprotected nodes and the protected nodes with a deposition layer the detailed procedure for bed level updating is described as follows i when δ a b i 0 the thickness of bed deposition δ z i j b at each node can be calculated by δ z i j b q i j δ a b i 0 5 q i j q i j 1 δ b i j δ b i j width at the j th sub section j covers all nodes at the i th cross section ii when δa b i 0 the allocation of δ a b i differs in the zones with and without the river regulation works at the unprotected nodes pc 0 1 2 and the protected nodes covered by a sediment deposition layer pc 3 and z i j b z i j 0 bed erosion is permitted to occur δ z i j b q i j δ a b i 0 5 q i j q i j 1 δ b i j j covers all the scour permitted nodes however once the calculated value of δ z i j b is larger than the value of z i j b z i j 0 at those protected zones δ z i j b should be revised as δ z i j b z i j 0 z i j b in addition bed erosion is not allowed at the protected nodes without sediment to be scoured pc 3 and z i j b z i j 0 and the corresponding value of δ z i j b is equal to zero finally the bed level at all nodes of a cross section is updated z i j b z i j b δ z i j b 2 2 5 calculation procedure for the improved model the calculation flow chart for the improved model is given in fig 4 firstly different zones at each cross section are distinguished by specified point codes and the initial conditions are determined then the flow conditions at the t time are simulated using the one dimensional governing equations for water flow eqs 1 and 2 through the process of model calibration to determine the riverbed roughness next the section averaged suspended sediment concentration at each cross section s i is calculated using eq 3 based on the amended value of s i at the t 1 time subsequently the section averaged sediment transport capacity at the t time s i is calculated under the new flow conditions at the t time owing to the effect of river regulation works s i is modified according to the aforementioned method after that the value of bed deformation area δ a b i is calculated using eq 4 based on the modified value of s i at the t time and the bed level at each node is then updated finally the flow and sediment conditions are calculated under the updated topography for the next time step it should be noted that the riverbed roughness is one of the key parameters in a one dimensional morphodynamic model and it is closely associated with the flow and sediment regime bed forms channel geometry etc there are two methods to determine the bed resistance one is to establish the relationship between the roughness coefficient and the above mentioned influencing factors however there are many factors affecting the bed resistance and this method cannot take account of all of them the second is to back calculate the bed roughness coefficients under different discharges according to the observed discharge and water level processes at hydrometric or level gauge stations of the study reach guo et al 2008 he et al 2012 xia et al 2018 in practice the second method is widely used and also adopted in the current investigation in the improved model bed roughness coefficients of the floodplain and main channel zones were specified respectively the manning roughness coefficients on the floodplain were regarded as constants the coefficients in the main channel zones under different discharges were calibrated successively to make the calculated stage discharge rating curves at the hydrometric and level gauge stations fit the corresponding measurements well then the manning roughness coefficients at other cross sections were obtained by liner interpolation according to the calibrated results at these stations 3 model application in this investigation the improved model considering the effect of river regulation works was calibrated using the measured data of the jingjiang reach in 2015 and the measurements in 2016 was used to verify the model the related data were mainly collected from the changjiang water resources commission cwrc 3 1 description of study reach the jingjiang reach has a total length of about 347 km located between zhicheng and lianhuatang and it is usually divided into two subreaches termed the upper and lower jingjang reach ujr and ljr this reach is a multi branched meandering channel consisting of sixteen river bends with central bars distributed widely in the bends it is linked with lake dongting by three tributaries and the water discharge and sediment load are diverted into the lake through three diversion inlets of songzikou taipingkou ouchikou fig 5 in terms of bed composition the riverbed upstream of jiangkou is mainly composed of sand gravel and pebble of about 20 25 m in thickness the downstream riverbed comprises medium fine sand with a mean median diameter of 0 18 mm as for the composition of riverbank the majority of riverbanks in the ujr are composed of a thin sand lower layer and a clay upper layer of 8 10 m and the riverbanks in the ljr mainly consist of a thick sand lower layer of up to 30 m and a 2 4 m clay upper layer the inlet section zhicheng of the jingjiang reach is located 102 km downstream of the three gorges dam and upstream damming caused significant channel degradation along the reach with the cumulative scour volume of up to 10 05 108 m3 during the period 2002 2017 it is an important navigable reach of the middle yangtze river and however continuous channel degradation often threatens the channel stability in local regions therefore extensive river regulation works have been constructed in this reach according to uncomplete statistics there were more than 34 sites of shoal protection works and 16 sites of bed protection works implemented along the study reach such as the sites of dongshizhou and liutiaozhou the distribution of major projects is shown in fig 5 with respect to bank protection works 120 km long bankline has been protected in the ujr riverbanks on both sides of the ljr have been protected for more than half a century with the protected bank length of up to 146 km 3 2 setup for boundary and initial conditions 3 2 1 boundary conditions during the process of model validation the observed time series of discharge concentration and grain size distribution of suspended sediment at the zhicheng station zc were used as the upstream boundary condition meanwhile the time series of water level at the luoshan station ls was adopted as the downstream boundary condition it should be noted that the lianhuatang station is the outlet station of the jingjiang reach and however it is a water gauge station and the data of discharge and sediment load are not measured to easily conduct the process of model validation the domain of the study reach was extended to the hydrometric station of luoshan 35 km downstream of lianhuatang fig 6 gives the hydrographs of discharge and sediment concentration at zhicheng and the time series of water level at luoshan measured during the period 2015 2016 cwrc 2017 it can be seen that the maximum discharges at zhicheng reached 31 600 m3 s and 34 000 m3 s in these two years and the maximum sediment concentrations were 0 107 kg m3 and 0 147 kg m3 the maximum water level at luoshan were 28 28 m and 31 36 m respectively the overall variation trends were consistent in these two years with some differences in the detailed changing processes for example the interval between two peak discharges in 2015 was much greater than that in 2016 there was only one sediment peak in 2015 while it appeared twice in 2016 in addition the time series of flow and sediment diverted into the dongting lake through three branches were specified as the lateral boundary condition the 185 post flood cross sectional profiles measured in november 2014 and october 2015 and the corresponding point codes at these cross sections were used as the riverbed boundary conditions for the model calibration and verification processes 3 2 2 initial conditions the numerical model is usually required to run for sufficient time without bed level updating to achieve a steady state under the given boundary conditions and the spin up time is set to 48 h in each simulation case these steady state results including discharge water level fractional suspended sediment concentrations at each cross section were then taken as the initial conditions of the one dimensional model when the model considers the influence of river regulation works these initial conditions were computed under the regulated river hypothesis otherwise they were calculated without the consideration of regulation works besides the grain size distributions of bed material at 72 cross sections observed in november 2014 and october 2015 cwrc 2017 were specified respectively as the initial bed material condition for model calibration and verification fig 7 shows that the variation in bed material composition was not significant during the period from november 2014 to october 2015 and actually the grain sizes of bed material at all the measured sections mainly ranged between 0 2 mm and 0 5 mm in the study reach 3 3 modelling of the 2015 channel evolution for calibration 3 3 1 calibrated results of discharge and water level in 2015 based on the above procedure the measured data in 2015 were used to calibrate the improved model with close agreement between the calculated and measured results being obtained for example the model predicted discharges were in great accordancewith the field observed discharges at three hydrometric sections fig 8 a c at shashi fig 8a the calculated maximum discharge in july was 25 812 m3 s about 1 smaller than the corresponding measured value of 26 200 m3 s the calculated peak discharge in august was 21 778 m3 s extremely close to the observed value 21 700 m3 s at jianli and luoshan the calculated discharge processes also fitted well with the observed hydrographs fig 8b and c with the mean relative errors mres of both about 3 table 1 in addition comparisons between the model predicted and observed water level hydrographs at three hydrometric stations of zhicheng shashi and jianli are also presented in fig 8d f and the values of mre varied between 0 and 1 at these stations table 1 in terms of manning roughness coefficients the values for the low and high floodplain zones in the jingjiang reach were given as constants of 0 025 and 0 040 in the model calibration process the roughness coefficient of main channel zones decreased as the discharge increased from 6 000 to 53 000 m3 s varying from 0 055 to 0 010 which was fallen in the reasonable range of manning roughness coefficients of natural rivers 3 3 2 calibrated results of suspended sediment concentration in 2015 the parameter k 1 for the formula of sediment transport capacity was also calibrated under different discharges at three hydrometric stations of shashi jianli and luoshan according to the aforementioned method the calculated concentration hydrographs generally fitted with the corresponding observed hydrographs in 2015 fig 9 for example the calculated maximum sediment concentrations at these three stations were 0 172 0 136 and 0 372 kg m3 which closely agreed with the measurements of 0 173 0 191 and 0 362 kg m3 furthermore the mean absolute errors maes between the calculated and observed suspended sediment concentrations were 0 011 0 026 and 0 016 kg m3 with the corresponding mres of 33 38 and 18 table 1 generally the agreement between the calculated and measured sediment concentrations was lower than that for the hydrodynamic factors of discharge and water level in terms of the calibrated coefficient k 1 and the exponent m k 1 varied with the magnitude of discharge ranging between 0 01 and 0 24 kg m3 among three stations while the value of m was set to a constant of 0 88 since the calculated values of u 3 ghω m were in the range of 0 2 3 7 along the study reach the parameters k 1 and m generally accorded with the corresponding values in fig 3 because of a considerable difference in settling and transport properties of suspended sediment for different particle sizes the non uniform suspended sediment in the jingjiang reach is usually divided into three size fractions including fine sediment with the diameter d 0 031 mm medium sediment with d 0 031 0 125 mm and coarse sediment with d 0 125 mm fig 10 shows the calculated and observed concentration hydrographs for each fraction at shashi and jianli in 2015 the suspended sediment concentrations for the fine and coarse sediment fractions were greater than the values for the medium fraction at these two stations at shashi the maes for three fractions were 0 010 0 004 and 0 007 kg m3 at jianli the maes for these fractions was about 0 015 0 008 and 0 023 kg m3 respectively generally the variation trends in graded suspended sediment concentrations obtained from the improved model fitted with the field measurements 3 4 verified results of the 2016 channel evolution 3 4 1 verified results of discharge and water level in 2016 the improved model was also verified using the data of the jingjiang reach observed in 2016 verified discharge and water level processes illustrate that the mres between the calculated and measured discharge varied between 3 and 4 at shashi jianli and luoshan and those for water level at 11 hydrometric sections were all in the range of 0 1 table 1 in addition the calculated maximum water levels z max were 43 50 38 31 and 34 10 m at shashi jianli and luoshan which were in good agreement with the measured values of 43 48 39 06 and 34 13 m furthermore the maes between the calculated and observed minimum water levels z min at these stations were in a small range of 0 00 0 78 m fig 11 based on the above results it can be concluded that the proposed model can reproduce the hydrographs of discharge and water level with satisfying accuracy 3 4 2 verified results of suspended sediment concentration in 2016 the suspended sediment concentrations in 2016 were also calculated at three hydrometric stations of shashi jianli and luoshan fig 12 the results show that the mres between the model predicted and observed suspended sediment concentrations were 22 35 and 18 respectively table 1 in addition the calculated maximum concentrations at three stations were about 0 262 0 190 and 0 343 kg m3 slightly different from the measured concentrations of 0 328 0 210 and 0 329 kg m3 overall the calculated sediment concentration hydrographs agreed well with the corresponding observed hydrographs in 2016 over the model verification process 4 discussion in order to investigate the effect of river regulation works the processes of sediment transport and bed deformation in 2016 were simulated using the model without the consideration of river regulation engineering with the corresponding calculations being compared with the results using the improved model 4 1 effect of large scale river regulation works on the process of sediment transport fig 13 shows the comparison between the model predicted suspended sediment concentrations under the aforementioned two conditions along the study reach at different simulation times in 2016 compared results show that the sediment concentrations without the consideration of regulation engineering in the model were generally larger than the values considering this effect and the absolute differences between them were in the range of 0 0 02 kg m3 at t 3000 6000 and 8760 h the calculated maximum concentration at luoshan s 0 343 kg m3 obtained from the improved model agreed better with the measurement s 0 329 kg m3 which was smaller than the calculated value s 0 346 kg m3 without the consideration of river regulation works the flow could not entrain enough sediment from the protected areas so it turned to scour other unprotected nodes at a cross section or the downstream sections therefore large scale river regulation works were likely to influence the process of sediment transport at reach scale 4 2 effect of large scale river regulation works on the process of bed deformation based on the calculation method of sediment discharge the channel scour volume was equal to 34 43 106 t in the jingjiang reach during the hydrological year of 2016 compared with the measured data the calculated scour volume was overestimated when river regulation works were not considered in the model with the value of 37 52 106 t however the channel scour volume obtained from the improved model with the consideration of regulation engineering was about 35 81 106 t 5 less than the result obtained from the common model which was closer to the measurements furthermore the variations in channel geometry at some specified cross sections during the study period were also investigated although it is unreasonable to compare the variation in cross sectional profiles obtained from a one dimensional model it is feasible to analyze the difference between the simulated results with and without the effect of river regulation works it can be seen from fig 14 that the obtained cross sectional profiles considering the effect of regulation engineering matched better with the observed profiles in 2016 for instance the local subreach between the sections of jing25 and jing31 was partly protected by bank revetment engineering fig 5 so channel erosion became more severe at the downstream section of jing32 the mean bed elevation at jing32 simulated using the model without the consideration of regulation works would be 0 46 m higher than the value using the improved model fig 14a in addition part of the main channel zone at the jing65 section was protected fig 5 but the simulated results show that the riverbed continued to incise by about 0 68 m in thes protected area when the effect of bed protection works was not considered in the model which was not in accord with the fact fig 14b 5 conclusions in this study a one dimensional 1d morphodynamic model has been improved to simulate the fluvial processes influenced by large scale river regulation works and the improved model was applied to the jingjiang reach of the middle yangtze river the following conclusions are drawn from this study i a one dimensional model was improved to consider the influence of river regulation works on channel evolution firstly different point codes were used to distinguish the zones of floodplain lips and main channel with and without river regulation works and the modules of sediment transport and bed deformation were then improved in the refined model bed deposition was permitted to occur at each node of a cross section in the case of bed scour it was only permitted to occur at the unprotected nodes or the protected nodes with a deposition layer newly formed over the previous simulation period however bed scour was not allowed at the protected nodes that were unable to be scoured anymore finally the improved model was applied to simulate the channel evolution of the jingjiang reach with the measured data in 2015 and 2016 being used to calibrate and verify the proposed model good agreement was obtained between the calculated and measured data therefore the improved model can reproduce the processes of flow sediment transport and bed deformation with satisfying accuracy ii the differences were investigated in the processes of sediment transport and bed deformation between two conditions with and without the consideration of large scale river regulation works in the model simulated results in the jingjiang reach show that the cumulative channel scour volume from the improved model was smaller than the calculated result from the common model without the consideration of river regulation works in general this phenomenon can occur in other rivers owing to the anti erosion effect of river regulation works moreover the variation in channel geometry was in closer agreement with the measurements with this effect being considered it was explained that the improved model considered the fact that river regulation works would limit the channel incision and the flow was likely to scour other unprotected bed at a cross section or the downstream sections when it could not entrain enough sediment from the protected bed declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this work was supported partly by the

6391,in an alluvial river various kinds of river regulation engineering are usually constructed along the reach for the stability of channel regime and the safety of flood control which greatly affects the process of channel evolution therefore a one dimensional 1d morphodynamic model has been improved to simulate the fluvial processes influenced by large scale river regulation works in the refined model each node of a cross section was labeled using a specified point code representing the zones of floodplain and main channel with or without regulation engineering and sediment transport and bed deformation in different zones were treated separately in the zones without regulation engineering both bed deposition and bed erosion were permitted to occur in the zones with regulation works bed deposition was allowed while bed erosion was not permitted to occur owing to the restriction of those engineering unless there was a deposition layer newly formed over the previous simulation period then the improved model was calibrated and verified using field observations through the application to a 347 km long alluvial channel located in the middle yangtze river in china the results for the year 2016 show that the channel scour volume without the effect of river regulation works was 9 greater than the measured value 34 43 106 t while the outcome considering this effect 35 81 106 t was in closer agreement with the measurements moreover the variation in channel geometry obtained from the improved model agreed better with the observed data river regulation works would limit the channel incision and it is likely to scour the other unprotected bed of a cross section or the downstream cross sections as the flow cannot carry enough sediment from the protected bed simulated results indicate that part of the main channel zone at the jing65 section was protected but the riverbed continued to incise by about 0 68 m in the protected area when the effect of bed protection works was not considered in the model which was not in accord with the observed channel geometry therefore this effect of large scale river regulation works on channel evolution needs to be considered for a higher simulation accuracy keywords river regulation works one dimensional morphodynamic model sediment transport bed deformation middle yangtze river 1 introduction in alluvial rivers various kinds of river regulation engineering e g bank protection engineering flow guide works are constructed along the reaches in the world s longest river mississippi river the channel has been stabilized by bank revetment engineering with a 1400 km length which has greatly reduced bank erosion and lateral channel migration kesel 2003 likewise large scale bank protection works were also constructed along the middle and lower yangtze river with the protected bank length of about 1450 km cwrc 2017 moreover a total of 9096 spur dikes and short spurs were constructed in the lower yellow river before 1997 and 323 sites of river regulation works such as levee protection and flow guidance covered a total length of 647 km in this reach wu et al 2005 therefore it is necessary to investigate the influence of river regulation engineering on channel evolution processes common methods for investigations into the effect of river regulation engineering mainly include analysis of field measurements physical river modelling and numerical modelling the method of data analysis can obtain the detailed impacts of river regulation engineering in local zones or reach a qualitative conclusion for a long reach ten brinke et al 1998 surian 1999 kiss et al 2008 2011 nakagawa et al 2013 sarker et al 2014 but it needs many field data that are always unavailable in practice physical river models usually require great space and investment and it is difficult to take a long reach as the study region asaro and paris 2000 giri et al 2004 roca et al 2007 ghodsian and vaghefi 2009 bhuiyan et al 2010 nakagawa et al 2013 quite few researchers attempted to investigate this topic using numerical modelling and previous studies mainly investigated the local influence caused by a specified kind of river regulation engineering including the induced changes in flow structure sediment transport and channel geometry asaro and paris 2000 giri et al 2004 minor et al 2007 nakagawa et al 2013 for example asaro and paris 2000 used a two dimensional 2d model to investigate the effect induced by the construction of a new embankment at the confluence between two rivers giri et al 2004 adopted a 2d numerical model to simulate the depth averaged flow properties turbulent and vorticity fields in a meandering like flume with spurs minor et al 2007 adopted a three dimensional numerical model to examine the turbulent flow field and the associated sediment transport due to a series of barbs in a channel bend and compared the effect of different arrangements of barb groups on channel adjustments it is noted that these models are usually two or three dimensional ones and are difficult to be applied in long reaches due to the limitation of computer time however sometimes it is necessary to understand the overall impacts of these river regulation works on channel evolution especially in a long reach with a mass of regulation works in this study the focus is paid to investigate the effect of bed shoal and bank protection works on channel evolution it is commonly acknowledged that these kinds of large scale regulation works have a particularly significant impact on the processes of sediment transport and bed deformation for example it can limit the degrees of bank retreat and riverbed incision in the protected areas and may aggravate bed deformation downstream of these regions yu and lu 2008 meanwhile many researchers found that the construction of bank revetment engineering changed the flow structure and accelerated near bank deposition rates surian 1999 kiss et al 2008 2011 furthermore these works can not only induce channel adjustments in local regions but also can cause considerable impacts at reach scale especially in a bifurcated reach shoal protection projects implemented on central bars may influence the alternative shifting of its main and secondary branches and consequently change the river regime which is very likely to affect the process of channel deformation at a relatively large scale yu and lu 2008 therefore it is appropriate to investigate the effect of large scale river regulation works on the channel evolution process in a long reach using an improved one dimensional morphodynamic model the jingjiang reach located in the middle yangtze river is selected as the study region because extensive river regulation works have been carried out in this reach moreover the operation of the three gorges dam tgd caused significant channel degradation along this reach and thus more river regulation works were constructed for the stability of channel regime and the safety of flood control the scientific aims of this study are to i improve the existing one dimensional morphodynamic model with the influence of river regulation works on channel adjustments being considered and ii quantitatively compare the processes of sediment transport and bed deformation under two scenarios with and without the effect of river regulation works 2 description of the morphodynamic model 2 1 one dimensional governing equations in the current study the processes of flow and sediment transport and the

dimensional governing equations and discrete schemes presented in the study of deng et al 2019 however there exist great differences between these two studies first the aim of the present study is to improve a one dimensional model to consider the influence of large scale river regulation works on channel evolution however the study of deng et al 2019 aimed to develop a coupled model to simulate both bed deformation and bank erosion second the improvements of the morphodynamic 1d model are different in these studies in the present study a one dimensional morphodynamic model was improved in the modules of determination of riverbed boundary condition calculation of sediment transport capacity simulation of sediment transport and bed deformation to investigate the effect of river regulation works however deng et al 2019 integrated a one dimensional morphodynamic model with a two dimensional module of ground water flow and a bank erosion module for the cantilever failure of a composite riverbank to simulate the processes of bed deformation and bank erosion in a long reach 2 2 improvements in the morphodynamic model 2 2 1 determination of riverbed boundary condition the first improvement in the current model is to differentiate the zones of floodplain lips and main channel with and without river regulation works when determining the riverbed boundary condition in the previous models cross sectional profiles are usually used as the initial riverbed boundary condition merely including the distance from the left bank and the corresponding bed level at each node of a cross section in the improved model different zones of a cross section are demarcated by different point codes pc fig 1 first step is to distinguish the floodplain pc 2 and main channel zones pc 3 or pc 0 because a mutation in hydraulic conditions will occur when the water overflows the floodplain lips to achieve it the active floodplain lips of a cross section pc 1 need to be determined and the turning point over which hydraulic conditions will change greatly is regarded as the lip of the active floodplain the main passage between the two lips of the active floodplains on both sides is often defined as the zone of main channel xia et al 2014 the second step is to differentiate the zones with pc 3 and without river regulation works pc 0 because of its significant impacts on the riverbed boundary condition then all the measured cross sectional profiles and the corresponding point codes are used as the riverbed boundary condition in the improved model what s more the channel is usually constituted by deposition movable and unmovable layers successively along the vertical direction with z i j b representing the bed level of a node and z i j 0 representing the bed elevation of a node at the initial time fig 2 deposition layer is a sediment layer newly formed over the previous simulation period and it is assumed that there is no sediment deposition in the protected areas at the initial time the parameter r i is proposed to represent the ratio of the equivalent length of scour permitted riverbed l i q i j p i j q i to the total wetted perimeter p i which means r i l i p i q i j discharge at the j th sub section p i j wetted perimeter at the j th sub section it is determined that bed scour only occurs at the unprotected nodes pc 0 1 2 and the protected nodes with a deposition layer pc 3 and z i j b z i j 0 however it is not permitted at the protected nodes without sediment to be scoured pc 3 and z i j b z i j 0 according to the above mentioned principles the total equivalent length of scour permitted riverbed l i can be determined with the value of r i being further calculated 2 2 2 calculation of sediment transport capacity the second improvement is to amend the calculation method for sediment transport capacity s it is commonly known that the selection of calculation formula for sediment transport capacity and the determination of parameters directly affect the simulation accuracy of bed deformation up to now various semi empirical and semi theoretical formulas have been proposed and used to calculate the sediment transport capacity zhang and zhang 1992 hager 2003 guo et al 2008 rahman et al 2013 tan et al 2018 in the improved model the semi empirical formula proposed by zhang tan et al 2018 is adopted because it is applicable to alluvial rivers carrying low sediment concentrations such as the middle yangtze river in china chen et al 2008 zhou et al 2009 yuan et al 2012 the formula is written in the following form 5 s k 1 u 3 g h ω m m where k 1 coefficient kg m3 m exponent ω m group settling velocity of non uniform suspended sediment m s ω m k 1 n δ p k ω k m 1 m where δ p k is the percentage of the sediment transport capacity for the kth fraction and it can be determined by the approach of li 1987 then the sediment transport capacity for each fraction can be given as s k δ p k s in terms of parameter determination k 1 and m for the yangtze river are usually given as constants in previous studies zhang and xie 1989 zhou et al 2009 yuan et al 2012 but they actually vary in different case studies for example k 1 and m were 0 15 kg m3 and 1 0 respectively in the study of zhou et al 2009 the coefficient k 1 was 0 07 kg m3 and the exponent m was 1 14 in the study of yuan et al 2012 in fact zhang and xie 1989 pointed out that these parameters were related to the variation in a comprehensive parameter of u 3 ghω m fig 3 gives the relationships between k 1 m and u 3 ghω m and these curves were calibrated using the measured flow and sediment data in many quasi equilibrium rivers and laboratory flumes zhang and xie 1989 it is noted that the exponent m decreases generally with the increasing u 3 ghω m and it is almost a constant of about 1 50 when the value of u 3 ghω m is less than 4 0 the coefficient k 1 increases with a larger u 3 ghω m however it is difficult to be determined according to the curves in fig 3 when the value of u 3 ghω m is less than 4 0 e g in the jingjiang reach even though the value of u 3 ghω m is larger than 4 0 the value of k 1 is in the region between two dashed curves and it is still impossible to obtain an accurate result to solve this problem the values of k 1 under different discharges were carefully calibrated in the improved model to guarantee that the calculated suspended sediment concentrations at key hydrometric sections of the study reach agreed with the corresponding measurements then the values of k 1 at other cross sections were obtained by liner interpolation based on the calibrated values at these hydrometric sections furthermore when the water overflows the floodplain lips the mean velocity in section changes little but the average depth will decrease greatly along with a sharp increase in sediment transport capacity which is inconsistent with the fact to solve this problem the sediment transport capacity for the zones of main channel and floodplain s mc and s fp are calculated respectively based on the respective flow conditions then according to the known discharges for main channel and floodplain zones q mc and q fp the total sediment transport capacity at a cross section is calculated by s q mc s mc q fp s fp q mc q fp 2 2 3 improvement in the module of sediment transport the third improvement is to modify the module of sediment transport in this module the section averaged sediment transport capacity s i at the i th section is first calculated based on the aforementioned method since bed scour at a few sections would be restricted by river regulation works s i calculated by eq 5 needs to be modified accordingly to consider this effect the modification details are given as follows i when the calculated section averaged sediment transport capacity s i is smaller than the section averaged suspended sediment concentration s i at the t time bed deposition occurs and it is permitted at all nodes of a cross section therefore s i is still equal to the value of the original calculation s i ii when riverbed suffers scour s i s i the value of s i needs to be revised by the equation of s i s i s i s i r i k 2 under the scenario with the presence of river regulation works the parameter r i represents the ratio of the equivalent length of scour permitted riverbed to the total wetted perimeter which is illustrated in the above section the parameter k2 is a correction coefficient and it is set as k 2 2 r i 1 when the flow cannot obtain sufficient sediment in the zones with river regulation works it may scour the other unprotected nodes at a cross section which causes a larger channel scour intensity at these nodes the correction coefficient k 2 is exactly proposed to consider this influence and its value needs to be greater than 1 this parameter should also be related to the ratio r i when r i 1 the parameter k 2 should be equal to 1 because there are no river regulation works to cause this influence when 0 r i 1 the channel scour intensity at the unprotected nodes will become larger as the value of r i decreases so the parameter k 2 should be negatively correlated with the magnitude of r i to meet the above criterion the correction coefficient k 2 is finally set to 2 r i and it is equal to 2 as the riverbed is totally protected r i 0 moreover it is easily noted that the value of r i is in the range of 0 1 when r i 0 the riverbed is totally protected and not allowed to be scoured at a whole cross section therefore the value of s i is set to s i in order to guarantee that there is no bed deformation at this cross section when r i 1 it means that no river regulation engineering is implemented at the cross section thus bed scour is permitted at the total wetted perimeter and it is not necessary to modify the originally calculated value of s i while 0 r i 1 the riverbed is partly protected and the top priority is to determine the value of r i and then the value of s i can be calculated by s i s i s i s i r i k 2 2 2 4 improvement in the module of bed deformation in terms of bed deformation the deformation area at the i th cross section δ a b i is first calculated by the equation of bed deformation based on the modified value of s i in the previous models without the consideration of river regulation works δ a b i is usually allocated averagely or according to the unit length discharge at each sub section q i j in the modified module the allocation pattern varies in different situations when bed deposition occurs δ a b i is allocated among all nodes of a cross section when it suffers erosion δ a b i is merely distributed among the unprotected nodes and the protected nodes with a deposition layer the detailed procedure for bed level updating is described as follows i when δ a b i 0 the thickness of bed deposition δ z i j b at each node can be calculated by δ z i j b q i j δ a b i 0 5 q i j q i j 1 δ b i j δ b i j width at the j th sub section j covers all nodes at the i th cross section ii when δa b i 0 the allocation of δ a b i differs in the zones with and without the river regulation works at the unprotected nodes pc 0 1 2 and the protected nodes covered by a sediment deposition layer pc 3 and z i j b z i j 0 bed erosion is permitted to occur δ z i j b q i j δ a b i 0 5 q i j q i j 1 δ b i j j covers all the scour permitted nodes however once the calculated value of δ z i j b is larger than the value of z i j b z i j 0 at those protected zones δ z i j b should be revised as δ z i j b z i j 0 z i j b in addition bed erosion is not allowed at the protected nodes without sediment to be scoured pc 3 and z i j b z i j 0 and the corresponding value of δ z i j b is equal to zero finally the bed level at all nodes of a cross section is updated z i j b z i j b δ z i j b 2 2 5 calculation procedure for the improved model the calculation flow chart for the improved model is given in fig 4 firstly different zones at each cross section are distinguished by specified point codes and the initial conditions are determined then the flow conditions at the t time are simulated using the one dimensional governing equations for water flow eqs 1 and 2 through the process of model calibration to determine the riverbed roughness next the section averaged suspended sediment concentration at each cross section s i is calculated using eq 3 based on the amended value of s i at the t 1 time subsequently the section averaged sediment transport capacity at the t time s i is calculated under the new flow conditions at the t time owing to the effect of river regulation works s i is modified according to the aforementioned method after that the value of bed deformation area δ a b i is calculated using eq 4 based on the modified value of s i at the t time and the bed level at each node is then updated finally the flow and sediment conditions are calculated under the updated topography for the next time step it should be noted that the riverbed roughness is one of the key parameters in a one dimensional morphodynamic model and it is closely associated with the flow and sediment regime bed forms channel geometry etc there are two methods to determine the bed resistance one is to establish the relationship between the roughness coefficient and the above mentioned influencing factors however there are many factors affecting the bed resistance and this method cannot take account of all of them the second is to back calculate the bed roughness coefficients under different discharges according to the observed discharge and water level processes at hydrometric or level gauge stations of the study reach guo et al 2008 he et al 2012 xia et al 2018 in practice the second method is widely used and also adopted in the current investigation in the improved model bed roughness coefficients of the floodplain and main channel zones were specified respectively the manning roughness coefficients on the floodplain were regarded as constants the coefficients in the main channel zones under different discharges were calibrated successively to make the calculated stage discharge rating curves at the hydrometric and level gauge stations fit the corresponding measurements well then the manning roughness coefficients at other cross sections were obtained by liner interpolation according to the calibrated results at these stations 3 model application in this investigation the improved model considering the effect of river regulation works was calibrated using the measured data of the jingjiang reach in 2015 and the measurements in 2016 was used to verify the model the related data were mainly collected from the changjiang water resources commission cwrc 3 1 description of study reach the jingjiang reach has a total length of about 347 km located between zhicheng and lianhuatang and it is usually divided into two subreaches termed the upper and lower jingjang reach ujr and ljr this reach is a multi branched meandering channel consisting of sixteen river bends with central bars distributed widely in the bends it is linked with lake dongting by three tributaries and the water discharge and sediment load are diverted into the lake through three diversion inlets of songzikou taipingkou ouchikou fig 5 in terms of bed composition the riverbed upstream of jiangkou is mainly composed of sand gravel and pebble of about 20 25 m in thickness the downstream riverbed comprises medium fine sand with a mean median diameter of 0 18 mm as for the composition of riverbank the majority of riverbanks in the ujr are composed of a thin sand lower layer and a clay upper layer of 8 10 m and the riverbanks in the ljr mainly consist of a thick sand lower layer of up to 30 m and a 2 4 m clay upper layer the inlet section zhicheng of the jingjiang reach is located 102 km downstream of the three gorges dam and upstream damming caused significant channel degradation along the reach with the cumulative scour volume of up to 10 05 108 m3 during the period 2002 2017 it is an important navigable reach of the middle yangtze river and however continuous channel degradation often threatens the channel stability in local regions therefore extensive river regulation works have been constructed in this reach according to uncomplete statistics there were more than 34 sites of shoal protection works and 16 sites of bed protection works implemented along the study reach such as the sites of dongshizhou and liutiaozhou the distribution of major projects is shown in fig 5 with respect to bank protection works 120 km long bankline has been protected in the ujr riverbanks on both sides of the ljr have been protected for more than half a century with the protected bank length of up to 146 km 3 2 setup for boundary and initial conditions 3 2 1 boundary conditions during the process of model validation the observed time series of discharge concentration and grain size distribution of suspended sediment at the zhicheng station zc were used as the upstream boundary condition meanwhile the time series of water level at the luoshan station ls was adopted as the downstream boundary condition it should be noted that the lianhuatang station is the outlet station of the jingjiang reach and however it is a water gauge station and the data of discharge and sediment load are not measured to easily conduct the process of model validation the domain of the study reach was extended to the hydrometric station of luoshan 35 km downstream of lianhuatang fig 6 gives the hydrographs of discharge and sediment concentration at zhicheng and the time series of water level at luoshan measured during the period 2015 2016 cwrc 2017 it can be seen that the maximum discharges at zhicheng reached 31 600 m3 s and 34 000 m3 s in these two years and the maximum sediment concentrations were 0 107 kg m3 and 0 147 kg m3 the maximum water level at luoshan were 28 28 m and 31 36 m respectively the overall variation trends were consistent in these two years with some differences in the detailed changing processes for example the interval between two peak discharges in 2015 was much greater than that in 2016 there was only one sediment peak in 2015 while it appeared twice in 2016 in addition the time series of flow and sediment diverted into the dongting lake through three branches were specified as the lateral boundary condition the 185 post flood cross sectional profiles measured in november 2014 and october 2015 and the corresponding point codes at these cross sections were used as the riverbed boundary conditions for the model calibration and verification processes 3 2 2 initial conditions the numerical model is usually required to run for sufficient time without bed level updating to achieve a steady state under the given boundary conditions and the spin up time is set to 48 h in each simulation case these steady state results including discharge water level fractional suspended sediment concentrations at each cross section were then taken as the initial conditions of the one dimensional model when the model considers the influence of river regulation works these initial conditions were computed under the regulated river hypothesis otherwise they were calculated without the consideration of regulation works besides the grain size distributions of bed material at 72 cross sections observed in november 2014 and october 2015 cwrc 2017 were specified respectively as the initial bed material condition for model calibration and verification fig 7 shows that the variation in bed material composition was not significant during the period from november 2014 to october 2015 and actually the grain sizes of bed material at all the measured sections mainly ranged between 0 2 mm and 0 5 mm in the study reach 3 3 modelling of the 2015 channel evolution for calibration 3 3 1 calibrated results of discharge and water level in 2015 based on the above procedure the measured data in 2015 were used to calibrate the improved model with close agreement between the calculated and measured results being obtained for example the model predicted discharges were in great accordancewith the field observed discharges at three hydrometric sections fig 8 a c at shashi fig 8a the calculated maximum discharge in july was 25 812 m3 s about 1 smaller than the corresponding measured value of 26 200 m3 s the calculated peak discharge in august was 21 778 m3 s extremely close to the observed value 21 700 m3 s at jianli and luoshan the calculated discharge processes also fitted well with the observed hydrographs fig 8b and c with the mean relative errors mres of both about 3 table 1 in addition comparisons between the model predicted and observed water level hydrographs at three hydrometric stations of zhicheng shashi and jianli are also presented in fig 8d f and the values of mre varied between 0 and 1 at these stations table 1 in terms of manning roughness coefficients the values for the low and high floodplain zones in the jingjiang reach were given as constants of 0 025 and 0 040 in the model calibration process the roughness coefficient of main channel zones decreased as the discharge increased from 6 000 to 53 000 m3 s varying from 0 055 to 0 010 which was fallen in the reasonable range of manning roughness coefficients of natural rivers 3 3 2 calibrated results of suspended sediment concentration in 2015 the parameter k 1 for the formula of sediment transport capacity was also calibrated under different discharges at three hydrometric stations of shashi jianli and luoshan according to the aforementioned method the calculated concentration hydrographs generally fitted with the corresponding observed hydrographs in 2015 fig 9 for example the calculated maximum sediment concentrations at these three stations were 0 172 0 136 and 0 372 kg m3 which closely agreed with the measurements of 0 173 0 191 and 0 362 kg m3 furthermore the mean absolute errors maes between the calculated and observed suspended sediment concentrations were 0 011 0 026 and 0 016 kg m3 with the corresponding mres of 33 38 and 18 table 1 generally the agreement between the calculated and measured sediment concentrations was lower than that for the hydrodynamic factors of discharge and water level in terms of the calibrated coefficient k 1 and the exponent m k 1 varied with the magnitude of discharge ranging between 0 01 and 0 24 kg m3 among three stations while the value of m was set to a constant of 0 88 since the calculated values of u 3 ghω m were in the range of 0 2 3 7 along the study reach the parameters k 1 and m generally accorded with the corresponding values in fig 3 because of a considerable difference in settling and transport properties of suspended sediment for different particle sizes the non uniform suspended sediment in the jingjiang reach is usually divided into three size fractions including fine sediment with the diameter d 0 031 mm medium sediment with d 0 031 0 125 mm and coarse sediment with d 0 125 mm fig 10 shows the calculated and observed concentration hydrographs for each fraction at shashi and jianli in 2015 the suspended sediment concentrations for the fine and coarse sediment fractions were greater than the values for the medium fraction at these two stations at shashi the maes for three fractions were 0 010 0 004 and 0 007 kg m3 at jianli the maes for these fractions was about 0 015 0 008 and 0 023 kg m3 respectively generally the variation trends in graded suspended sediment concentrations obtained from the improved model fitted with the field measurements 3 4 verified results of the 2016 channel evolution 3 4 1 verified results of discharge and water level in 2016 the improved model was also verified using the data of the jingjiang reach observed in 2016 verified discharge and water level processes illustrate that the mres between the calculated and measured discharge varied between 3 and 4 at shashi jianli and luoshan and those for water level at 11 hydrometric sections were all in the range of 0 1 table 1 in addition the calculated maximum water levels z max were 43 50 38 31 and 34 10 m at shashi jianli and luoshan which were in good agreement with the measured values of 43 48 39 06 and 34 13 m furthermore the maes between the calculated and observed minimum water levels z min at these stations were in a small range of 0 00 0 78 m fig 11 based on the above results it can be concluded that the proposed model can reproduce the hydrographs of discharge and water level with satisfying accuracy 3 4 2 verified results of suspended sediment concentration in 2016 the suspended sediment concentrations in 2016 were also calculated at three hydrometric stations of shashi jianli and luoshan fig 12 the results show that the mres between the model predicted and observed suspended sediment concentrations were 22 35 and 18 respectively table 1 in addition the calculated maximum concentrations at three stations were about 0 262 0 190 and 0 343 kg m3 slightly different from the measured concentrations of 0 328 0 210 and 0 329 kg m3 overall the calculated sediment concentration hydrographs agreed well with the corresponding observed hydrographs in 2016 over the model verification process 4 discussion in order to investigate the effect of river regulation works the processes of sediment transport and bed deformation in 2016 were simulated using the model without the consideration of river regulation engineering with the corresponding calculations being compared with the results using the improved model 4 1 effect of large scale river regulation works on the process of sediment transport fig 13 shows the comparison between the model predicted suspended sediment concentrations under the aforementioned two conditions along the study reach at different simulation times in 2016 compared results show that the sediment concentrations without the consideration of regulation engineering in the model were generally larger than the values considering this effect and the absolute differences between them were in the range of 0 0 02 kg m3 at t 3000 6000 and 8760 h the calculated maximum concentration at luoshan s 0 343 kg m3 obtained from the improved model agreed better with the measurement s 0 329 kg m3 which was smaller than the calculated value s 0 346 kg m3 without the consideration of river regulation works the flow could not entrain enough sediment from the protected areas so it turned to scour other unprotected nodes at a cross section or the downstream sections therefore large scale river regulation works were likely to influence the process of sediment transport at reach scale 4 2 effect of large scale river regulation works on the process of bed deformation based on the calculation method of sediment discharge the channel scour volume was equal to 34 43 106 t in the jingjiang reach during the hydrological year of 2016 compared with the measured data the calculated scour volume was overestimated when river regulation works were not considered in the model with the value of 37 52 106 t however the channel scour volume obtained from the improved model with the consideration of regulation engineering was about 35 81 106 t 5 less than the result obtained from the common model which was closer to the measurements furthermore the variations in channel geometry at some specified cross sections during the study period were also investigated although it is unreasonable to compare the variation in cross sectional profiles obtained from a one dimensional model it is feasible to analyze the difference between the simulated results with and without the effect of river regulation works it can be seen from fig 14 that the obtained cross sectional profiles considering the effect of regulation engineering matched better with the observed profiles in 2016 for instance the local subreach between the sections of jing25 and jing31 was partly protected by bank revetment engineering fig 5 so channel erosion became more severe at the downstream section of jing32 the mean bed elevation at jing32 simulated using the model without the consideration of regulation works would be 0 46 m higher than the value using the improved model fig 14a in addition part of the main channel zone at the jing65 section was protected fig 5 but the simulated results show that the riverbed continued to incise by about 0 68 m in thes protected area when the effect of bed protection works was not considered in the model which was not in accord with the fact fig 14b 5 conclusions in this study a one dimensional 1d morphodynamic model has been improved to simulate the fluvial processes influenced by large scale river regulation works and the improved model was applied to the jingjiang reach of the middle yangtze river the following conclusions are drawn from this study i a one dimensional model was improved to consider the influence of river regulation works on channel evolution firstly different point codes were used to distinguish the zones of floodplain lips and main channel with and without river regulation works and the modules of sediment transport and bed deformation were then improved in the refined model bed deposition was permitted to occur at each node of a cross section in the case of bed scour it was only permitted to occur at the unprotected nodes or the protected nodes with a deposition layer newly formed over the previous simulation period however bed scour was not allowed at the protected nodes that were unable to be scoured anymore finally the improved model was applied to simulate the channel evolution of the jingjiang reach with the measured data in 2015 and 2016 being used to calibrate and verify the proposed model good agreement was obtained between the calculated and measured data therefore the improved model can reproduce the processes of flow sediment transport and bed deformation with satisfying accuracy ii the differences were investigated in the processes of sediment transport and bed deformation between two conditions with and without the consideration of large scale river regulation works in the model simulated results in the jingjiang reach show that the cumulative channel scour volume from the improved model was smaller than the calculated result from the common model without the consideration of river regulation works in general this phenomenon can occur in other rivers owing to the anti erosion effect of river regulation works moreover the variation in channel geometry was in closer agreement with the measurements with this effect being considered it was explained that the improved model considered the fact that river regulation works would limit the channel incision and the flow was likely to scour other unprotected bed at a cross section or the downstream sections when it could not entrain enough sediment from the protected bed declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this work was supported partly by the

730000 china evaluation of calculation models for the unfrozen water content of freezing soil is very important for numerical simulations based on the published 250 laboratory data and around 5 years field observed data this paper evaluated the five widely used unfrozen water content models i e the zhang et al 2017a model the anderson and tice 1972 model the michalowski 1993 model the mckenzie et al 2007 model and the kozlowski 2007 model the results show that the five models can all be used to calculate the unfrozen water content of laboratory soil samples the anderson and tice 1972 model the michalowski 1993 model and the kozlowski 2007 model are descripted by gravimetric unfrozen water content however it is difficult to directly measure the gravimetric unfrozen water content during the freezing process the mckenzie et al 2007 model and the zhang et al 2017a model are descripted by volumetric unfrozen water content which can be directly measured during the freezing process besides the parameters of the zhang et al 2017a model are relatively simple although the model slightly overestimates the volumetric unfrozen water content for some laboratory soils therefore the zhang et al 2017a model is more convenient for numerical simulations furthermore all the models have great potential to calculate unfrozen water content of freezing soils in field observations this paper would provide significant reference for the selection of unfrozen water content models in the description of hydro thermo coupling process in cold regions keywords freezing soils unfrozen water content models performance database 1 introduction during the freezing process the liquid water unfrozen water content in soils reduces because the liquid water undergoes a phase transition into ice researchers have found that unfrozen water still exists in soils at temperatures below soil freezing point even lower 70 c williams 1964 the unfrozen water content has a significant influence on both the variation of temperatures zhang et al 2018a and the redistribution of volumetric ice content and volumetric water content li et al 2018 the variation of unfrozen water contents is often accompanied with moisture migration zhang et al 2017b zhang et al 2018b frost heave and thaw settlement during the freezing thawing processes li et al 2018 lu et al 2018 the unfrozen water content

patterson and smith 1980 spaans and baker 1995 stähli and stadler 1997 watanabe and osada 2017 the nuclear magnetic resonance nmr method ishizaki et al 1996 watanabe and wake 2009 yoshikawa and overduin 2005 and the dilatometer method koopmans and miller 1966 spaans and baker 1995 the dsc method measures the unfrozen water content by analyzing the release of thermal energy during the cooling process kozlowski 2003 2016 determined the unfrozen water content using this method and found that this method presented a high accuracy of unfrozen water content the tdr method determines the volumetric unfrozen water content by measuring the dielectric constant of freezing soils based on a four mixing model zhou et al 2014 determined the unfrozen water content in freezing soils using the tdr method and studied the soil freezing mechanism at the freezing front the nmr method measures the unfrozen water content by analyzing the nmr signal of the soil samples with different temperatures wen et al 2012 however it has some limitations for example a very small sized soil sample is required the device is very expensive zhou et al 2014 and this technique cannot dynamically measure the variation of unfrozen water content watanabe and wake 2009 studied the unfrozen water content in unsaturated soils using the nmr method ishizaki et al 1996 measured the amount of unfrozen water in freezing porous glass powder using nmr method and then evaluated the thickness of the layer of unfrozen water on the particle surface the dilatometer method determines the ice content by measuring the variation of gas pressure due to the volume expansion besides there are some other methods to measure the unfrozen water content e g pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance p nmr method anderson and tice 1973 standing wave ratio swr method wen et al 2012 neutron scattering maruyama et al 1992 method dielectric spectroscopy bittelli et al 2004 method and heat pulse probe method liu and si 2011 measurements of unfrozen water content are usually time consuming and expensive therefore the models for predicting the unfrozen water contents of freezing soils are very important the unfrozen water content models obtained from experiments are affected by many factors i e salt concentration stähli and stadler 1997 oquist et al 2010 applied pressures zhang et al 2017b soil specific surface area kozlowski 2016 and surface chemical properties stähli and stadler 1997 at present many unfrozen water content models have been used lai et al 2014 2018 yu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a however the accuracies of unfrozen water content models are not clear both for the small scale laboratory investigations and for the long term field observations therefore the paper evaluates the five widely used unfrozen water content models by comparing the calculated and measured volumetric unfrozen water contents from the 24 soil samples and the field observed data 2 unfrozen water content models according to the existed literatures five commonly used unfrozen water content models of soils are described as follows 2 1 zhang et al 2017a model zhang et al 2017a developed a model to predict volumetric unfrozen water content by soil temperature 1 θ u θ 0 1 t f t t k 0 t f ω t k0 t t f θ 0 t t f where θ u is the volumetric unfrozen water content θ 0 is the initial volumetric unfrozen water content t f is the initial freezing point of pore water t k0 is a constant which converts centigrade temperature to kelvin temperature t k0 273 15 in this model ω is the fitting parameter which is related to the characteristics of soils t is the soil temperature the zhang et al 2017a model assumes that all the liquid water in soil would change into ice if the soil temperature falls below the absolute zero 273 15 c this has been used to analyze the thermo mechanical stability of an embankment in permafrost regions and the results are satisfactory zhang et al 2017a 2 2 anderson and tice 1972 model anderson and tice 1972 observed that the gravimetric unfrozen water content in freezing soils could be simply expressed as a function of temperature with a simple power function 2 w u α t β t t f w 0 t t f where w u is the gravimetric unfrozen water content w 0 is the initial gravimetric unfrozen water content α and β are the fitting parameters the anderson and tice 1972 model is formulated on the assumption that the adsorptive force governs the freezing of pore water the variation of gravimetric unfrozen water content of soils is simultaneously controlled by the parameters α and β although the two parameters have no definite physical meaning this model has been used in many applications because of the very simple form li et al 2015 ji et al 2019 the volumetric unfrozen water content can be deduced as follows 3 θ u w u ρ d 100 ρ w where ρ d is the dry density of soil ρ w is the density of water 2 3 michalowski 1993 model michalowski 1993 proposed an gravimetric unfrozen water content model based on the experimental data from anderson and tice 1972 that is 4 w u w res w 0 w res exp μ t t f t t f w 0 t t f where w res is the residual gravimetric unfrozen water content at a low temperature and μ is the soil parameter which reflects the variation characteristic of unfrozen water content the volumetric unfrozen water content can also be approximately calculated by eq 3 the michalowski 1993 model assumes that the residual gravimetric unfrozen water content has no relationship with soil temperature this model has been used in the simulations of a one dimensional freezing process michalowski 1993 however mu et al 2018 found that the performance of the michalowski 1993 model is good only within a narrow temperature range 2 4 mckenzie et al 2007 model mckenzie et al 2007 developed an exponential function for the relationship between the degree of saturation and temperature 5 s w s wres 1 s wres exp t t f γ 2 where s w is the degree of saturation for the volumetric unfrozen water content s wres is the residual saturation corresponding to the residual volumetric unfrozen water content γ is the fitting parameter the mckenzie et al 2007 model is proposed on the assumption that the residual volumetric unfrozen water content is constant the relationship between the degree of saturation and the volumetric unfrozen water content is 6 s w θ u θ 0 similarly the relationship between the residual saturation and the residual volumetric unfrozen water content is 7 s wres θ res θ 0 substituting eqs 6 7 into eq 5 the expression of volumetric unfrozen water content is obtained as follows 8 θ u θ res θ 0 θ res exp t t f γ 2 t t f θ 0 t t f 2 5 kozlowski 2007 model kozlowski 2007 considered the relationship between the gravimetric unfrozen water content at a temperature below the freezing point and the total water content of the system and proposed a non linear piecewise gravimetric unfrozen water content model 9 w u w res t t res w res w 0 w res exp δ t f t t t res ε t res t t f w 0 t t f where t res is the temperature corresponding to w res δ and ε are the non interpretable coefficients which are responsible for fitting the function to the real values of gravimetric unfrozen water content in the range from t f to t res the volumetric unfrozen water content can also be approximately calculated by eq 3 the kozlowski 2007 model is developed on the assumption that all of the water remains in a liquid form when the soil temperature is above t f and the unabsorbed water is all frozen when the soil temperature is below t res actually there are other unfrozen water content models e g the fredlund and xing 1994 model related to the suction the wang et al 2017 model related to the pore size distribution the mu et al 2018 model related to the void ratio and the chai et al 2018 model related to the capillary water and bound water however these models are particularly complicated meanwhile these models are limited in practical application because numerous parameters need to be determined for the five commonly used models the accuracies of the unfrozen water content models are still not certain thus it is confused to decide which model should be used in practice to further distinguish the applicability of these models the root mean square error rmse in eq 10 and the average deviations ad in eq 11 are selected to evaluate the overall performance of the models the mathematical expressions are as follows 10 rmse i 1 n θ u ci θ u mi 2 n 11 ad 1 n 1 n θ u ci θ u mi where θ u ci and θ u mi are the calculated and measured volumetric unfrozen water contents respectively n is the number of measured data and i is a counter the rmse describes the absolute difference between the calculated and measured values the ad reflects the relative difference θ u ci overestimates θ u mi if ad 0 and θ u ci underestimates θ u mi θ u c i if ad 0 3 evaluation and discussion of models 3 1 mathematical formula comparison the frost heave would occur when the volume expansion generated due to the water ice phase transition exceeded the pores during the freezing process although the anderson and tice 1972 model the michalowski 1993 model and the kozlowski 2007 model are expressed by gravimetric unfrozen water content it is difficult to directly measure the gravimetric unfrozen water content during the freezing process on the contrary the unfrozen water content models proposed by the zhang et al 2017a and the mckenzie et al 2007 are expressed in volume the volumetric unfrozen water content can be directly measured during the freezing process to clearly illustrate the effect of model parameters on the variation of calculated volumetric unfrozen water contents for a given soil sample e g the soil no is w 3 table 1 the initial volumetric unfrozen water content is 35 60 the freezing point is 0 30 c and the residual volumetric unfrozen water content is 4 00 corresponding to the temperature of 15 00 c the variation of volumetric unfrozen water contents with temperature under different parameters are shown in fig 1 it can be seen that the parameters in the five models have different effects on the change process of the calculated volumetric unfrozen water content the volumetric unfrozen water content calculated by the zhang et al 2017a model increases with the parameter ω in the temperature range from t f to t k0 273 15 c fig 1a for the michalowski 1993 model the mckenzie et al 2007 mode and the kozlowski 2007 model the calculated unfrozen water contents vary with parameters from the initial water content to the residual unfrozen water content during the temperature range from t f to t res fig 1c e besides the variation characteristic of unfrozen water content calculated by the kozlowski 2007 model is determined by both the δ and the ε during the temperature range from t f to t res fig 1e the unfrozen water content calculated by the anderson and tice 1972 model is determined by both the α and β at the temperature below the freezing point fig 1b in practice the unfrozen water content of the models at a soil temperature t is affected by the boundary conditions when the soil temperature t approaches to the freezing point t f the boundary conditions for the zhang et al 2017a model eq 1 and the mckenzie et al 2007 model eq 8 are given in eqs 12a b and 13a b respectively 12a lim t t f θ u t θ 0 12b lim t t f θ u t 13a lim t t f θ u t θ 0 13b lim t t f θ u t 0 for the michalowski 1993 model eq 4 when the soil temperature t approaches to the freezing point t f the boundary conditions are 14a lim t t f w u t w 0 14b lim t t f w u t μ w 0 w res 0 for the kozlowski 2007 model eq 9 the derivative of the unfrozen water content is 15 w u t δ ε w 0 w res exp δ t f t t t res ε t f t ε 1 t res t f t t res 3 t res t t f when the soil temperature t approaches to the freezing point t f the boundary conditions for the kozlowski 2007 model are related to the ε therefore the boundary conditions at the temperature t f and t res are given in eqs 16a b and 17a b respectively 16a lim t t f w u t w 0 16b lim t t f w u t 0 ε 1 δ w 0 w res t f t res 2 ε 1 0 ε 1 17a lim t t res w u t w res 17b lim t t res w u t 0 actually the unfrozen water content rapidly decreases near the freezing point due to the drastic water ice phase transition therefore the maximum variation rate of the unfrozen water content curve occurs near the freezing point while for the mckenzie et al 2007 model eq 8 and the kozlowski 2007 model eq 9 ε 1 the derivative of the unfrozen water content curve at the freezing point is zero eq 13b and eq 16b which means that the unfrozen water content does not rapidly decrease near the freezing point it might be inconsistent with the actual variation of the unfrozen water contents during the freezing process 3 2 model evaluation by laboratory data 3 2 1 laboratory data description in this section the five unfrozen water content models are evaluated by a large database approximately 250 data points of laboratory experiments from 24 soil samples the characteristics of the soil samples e g location soil type specific density initial volumetric water content and tested method are listed in table 1 more details of the laboratory data could be found in the references low et al 1968 watanabe and mizoguchi 2002 yoshikawa and overduin 2005 azmatch et al 2012 wen et al 2012 ma et al 2015 kruse and darrow 2017 chai et al 2018 3 2 2 model evaluation table 2 shows the fitted parameters of the five models for the 24 soil samples the parameters θ 0 is determined by the initial volumetric water content the parameters θ res and t res are obtained by the residual volumetric unfrozen water content and its temperature during the freezing process respectively the parameters w 0 and w res are obtained according to the relationship between the volumetric unfrozen water content and the dry density eq 3 meanwhile the soils with different grain particles usually have different residual volumetric unfrozen water contents and the residual volumetric unfrozen water content is also related to soil temperature during the freezing process the michalowski 1993 model the mckenzie et al 2007 model and the kozlowski 2007 model contain the parameters θ res or w res so the unfrozen water content calculated by the three models is related to the corresponding temperature at which the unfrozen water content remains unchanged with the temperature i e the residual unfrozen water content thus the applications of the three models are sometimes limited fig 2 compares the calculated and measured volumetric unfrozen water contents of the 24 soil samples it can be seen that the volumetric unfrozen water content calculated by the zhang et al 2017a model matches well with the measured values the calculated values stand between the 10 deviation lines over the entire range of unfrozen water content for all soil samples fig 2a most of the volumetric unfrozen water contents calculated by the anderson and tice 1972 model are larger than the measured values in the range with low volumetric unfrozen water contents fig 2b it indicates that the calculated volumetric unfrozen water contents would be overestimated in this range for the anderson and tice 1972 model in addition for the michalowski 1993 model the mckenzie et al 2007 model and the kozlowski 2007 models the calculated volumetric unfrozen water contents are almost lower than the measured results in this range with low volumetric unfrozen water contents fig 2c e therefore the three models would underestimate the unfrozen water content in this range fig 2c e the differences between the calculated and measured results might be attributed to the parameters θ res w res and t res fig 3 shows the differences between the calculated and measured volumetric unfrozen water contents for different types of soils i e clay and silt from the reference ma et al 2015 it can be seen that the difference obtained by the zhang et al 2017a model is smaller than those by other models the differences calculated by the zhang et al 2017a model are within 1 0 for clay and within 0 5 for silt respectively fig 3a and b consequently the zhang et al 2017a model has relatively higher prediction accuracy for the clay and silt especially in the phase transition zone 1 0 c t 0 c fig 3a and b the rmse and ad of the 24 soil samples for the five models are shown in table 3 and table 4 respectively in general the rmses of the kozlowski 2007 model the mckenzie et al 2007 model the michalowski 1993 model and the anderson and tice 1972 model are obviously larger than those of the zhang et al 2017a model table 3 the relatively low values of rmses less than 1 60 for the zhang et al 2017a model indicate that the calculated volumetric unfrozen water contents agree well with the measured ones table 3 besides the ad values of the kozlowski 2007 model the mckenzie et al 2007 model and the michalowski 1993 model for most soil samples are negative therefore the three models overall underestimate volumetric unfrozen water content table 4 the ads of the zhang et al 2017a model for most soil samples are positive the absolute values of ad for the zhang et al 2017a models are greatly lower than those of other models and are much closer to zero table 4 thus the calculated results of the zhang et al 2017a model are superior to those of other models although it slightly overestimates the volumetric unfrozen water content for most of the soil samples 3 3 model evaluation by field observed data unlike volumetric unfrozen water contents calculated by laboratory data the volumetric unfrozen water contents of soils in field are greatly affected by many factors e g evaporation and rainfall meanwhile the hydro thermo boundary conditions in field are very complex the heat moisture interaction between atmosphere and soils is a long term process therefore it is important to evaluate whether the models are effective to predict the variation of unfrozen water content in field 3 3 1 field observed data description approximately 5 years field observed data from the published literature zhang et al 2017a are used to evaluate the field performance of the five models the field experiment site is near the chumaer river in the qinghai tibet plateau two soil layers are included within the depth of 13 00 m under the natural ground surface silty sand with gravel above 3 30 m and strongly weathered mudstone below 3 30 m the volumetric unfrozen water contents for silty sand are obtained at depth of 0 30 m under the gravel surface the moisture sensor with an accuracy of 2 0 is based on the tdr method the ground temperatures are measured by a thermistor at depth of 0 30 m the precision of the thermistor is 0 05 c pei et al 2019 the ground temperatures data are automatically collected with an interval of 1 0 h more details of the field experiment could be found in the reference zhang et al 2017a 3 3 2 model evaluation the observed ground temperatures under gravel surface 0 30 m depth are presented in fig 4 table 5 gives the fitted parameters of the five models for the field observed data the parameter θ res in the mckenzie et al 2007 model is 9 75 and the parameter w res in the michalowski 1993 model and the kozlowski 2007 model is 6 10 at the related temperature of 11 0 c meanwhile the parameter θ 0 and the parameter t f for the silty sand are 20 7 and 0 13 c respectively zhang et al 2017a comparison between the calculated and observed volumetric unfrozen water contents is illustrated in fig 5 it is found that all the models have great potential to calculate volumetric unfrozen water content of the silty sand under gravel surface 0 03 m depth however the anderson and tice 1972 model has singularities at the freezing point which is unacceptable for numerical calculation the singularities at freezing point might trigger non convergence problem in numerical simulations the non convergence of the anderson and tice 1972 model is also demonstrated by the research mckenzie et al 2007 the calculation error is relatively large in the range with lower volumetric unfrozen water content for the michalowski 1993 model the mckenzie et al 2007 model and the kozlowski 2007 model fig 5c e additionally the michalowski 1993 model the mckenzie et al 2007 model and the kozlowski 2007 model are not convenient to be used due to the complex parameters e g the residual gravimetric unfrozen water content for the michalowski 1993 model and the mckenzie et al 2007 model the residual volumetric unfrozen water content and its corresponding temperature for the kozlowski 2007 model moreover the calculated volumetric unfrozen water contents by the zhang et al 2017a model fit the observed data well r 2 0 916 fig 5a besides there is only one parameter related to soil characteristics in the zhang et al 2017a model which makes it convenient for application 4 conclusions this study evaluated the five widely used unfrozen water content models based on the published laboratory data and field observed data some conclusions are drawn 1 the parameters in the five models have different effects on the change process of the calculated volumetric unfrozen water content the anderson and tice 1972 model the michalowski 1993 model and the kozlowski 2007 model are expressed by gravimetric unfrozen water content while it is difficult to directly measure the gravimetric unfrozen water content during the freezing process the mckenzie et al 2007 model and the zhang et al 2017a model are expressed by volumetric unfrozen water content and it can be directly measured during the freezing process 2 although the zhang et al 2017a model slightly overestimates the volumetric unfrozen water content for some soil samples the parameters in this model are relatively simple therefore the zhang et al 2017a model can be more convenient in numerical simulations 3 all the models have great potential to calculate volumetric unfrozen water content of soils under the complex hydro thermo boundary conditions in field however the anderson and tice 1972 model has singularities at freezing point which might trigger convergence problem in numerical simulations declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this research was supported

field observed data this paper evaluated the five widely used unfrozen water content models i e the zhang et al 2017a model the anderson and tice 1972 model the michalowski 1993 model the mckenzie et

2017a model is more convenient for numerical simulations furthermore all the models have great potential to calculate unfrozen water content of freezing soils in field observations this paper would provide significant reference for the selection of unfrozen water content models in the description of hydro thermo coupling process in cold regions keywords freezing soils unfrozen water content models performance database 1 introduction during the freezing process the liquid water unfrozen water content in soils reduces because the liquid water undergoes a phase transition into ice researchers have found that unfrozen water still exists in soils at temperatures below soil freezing point even lower 70 c williams 1964 the unfrozen water content has a significant influence on both the variation of temperatures zhang et al 2018a and the redistribution of volumetric ice content and volumetric water content li et al 2018 the variation of unfrozen water contents is often accompanied with moisture migration zhang et al 2017b zhang et al 2018b frost heave and thaw settlement during the freezing thawing processes li et al 2018 lu et al 2018 the unfrozen water content significantly influences soil thermal mechanical properties and thus causes many engineering problems including the cracking of pavement the damage of structure and foundation the amount of unfrozen water affects the thermal shen et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a hydrological zhang et al 2018c and mechanical of soils li et al 2018 xu et al 2019 during the freezing and thawing process watanabe and flury 2008 furthermore the unfrozen water content is an important indictor to the stability of engineering in cold regions li et al 2015 which prominently affects the heat and mass transport processes in active layer and permafrost layer romanovsky and osterkamp 2000 and the microbial activities and biogeochemical processes in soils oquist et al 2010 measurements of the unfrozen water contents in freezing soils can be mainly divided into four categories namely the differential scanning calorimetry dsc method kozlowski 2003 2007 2016 williams 1964 the time domain reflectometry tdr method patterson and smith 1980 spaans and baker 1995 stähli and stadler 1997 watanabe and osada 2017 the nuclear magnetic resonance nmr method ishizaki et al 1996 watanabe and wake 2009 yoshikawa and overduin 2005 and the dilatometer method koopmans and miller 1966 spaans and baker 1995 the dsc method measures the unfrozen water content by analyzing the release of thermal energy during the cooling process kozlowski 2003 2016 determined the unfrozen water content using this method and found that this method presented a high accuracy of unfrozen water content the tdr method determines the volumetric unfrozen water content by measuring the dielectric constant of freezing soils based on a four mixing model zhou et al 2014 determined the unfrozen water content in freezing soils using the tdr method and studied the soil freezing mechanism at the freezing front the nmr method measures the unfrozen water content by analyzing the nmr signal of the soil samples with different temperatures wen et al 2012 however it has some limitations for example a very small sized soil sample is required the device is very expensive zhou et al 2014 and this technique cannot dynamically measure the variation of unfrozen water content watanabe and wake 2009 studied the unfrozen water content in unsaturated soils using the nmr method ishizaki et al 1996 measured the amount of unfrozen water in

accuracies of unfrozen water content models are not clear both for the small scale laboratory investigations and for the long term field observations therefore the paper evaluates the five widely used unfrozen water content models by comparing the calculated and measured volumetric unfrozen water contents from the 24 soil samples and the field observed data 2 unfrozen water content models according to the existed literatures five commonly used unfrozen water content models of soils are described as follows 2 1 zhang et al 2017a model zhang et al 2017a developed a model to predict volumetric unfrozen water content by soil temperature 1 θ u θ 0 1 t f t t k 0 t f ω t k0 t t f θ 0 t t f where θ u is the volumetric unfrozen water content θ 0 is the initial volumetric unfrozen water content t f is the initial freezing point of pore water t k0 is a constant which converts centigrade temperature to kelvin temperature t k0 273 15 in this model ω is the fitting parameter which is related to the characteristics of soils t is the soil temperature the zhang et al 2017a model assumes that all the liquid water in soil would change into ice if the soil temperature falls below the absolute zero 273 15 c this has been used to analyze the thermo mechanical stability of an embankment in permafrost regions and the results are satisfactory zhang et al 2017a 2 2 anderson and tice 1972 model anderson and tice 1972 observed that the gravimetric unfrozen water content in freezing soils could be simply expressed as a function of temperature with a simple power function 2 w u α t β t t f w 0 t t f where w u is the gravimetric unfrozen water content w 0 is the initial gravimetric unfrozen water content α and β are the fitting parameters the anderson and tice 1972 model is formulated on the assumption that the adsorptive force governs the freezing of pore water the variation of gravimetric unfrozen water content of soils is simultaneously controlled by the parameters α and β although the two parameters have no definite physical meaning this model has been used in many applications because of the very simple form li et al 2015 ji et al 2019 the volumetric unfrozen water content can be deduced as follows 3 θ u w u ρ d 100 ρ w where ρ d is the dry density of soil ρ w is the density of water 2 3 michalowski 1993 model michalowski 1993 proposed an gravimetric unfrozen water content model based on the experimental data from anderson and tice 1972 that is 4 w u w res w 0 w res exp μ t t f t t f w 0 t t f where w res is the residual gravimetric unfrozen water content at a low temperature and μ is the soil parameter which reflects the variation characteristic of unfrozen water content the volumetric unfrozen water content can also be approximately calculated by eq 3 the michalowski 1993 model assumes that the residual gravimetric unfrozen water content has no relationship with soil temperature this model has been used in the simulations of a one dimensional freezing process michalowski 1993 however mu et al 2018 found that the performance of the michalowski 1993 model is good only within a narrow temperature range 2 4 mckenzie et al 2007 model mckenzie et al 2007 developed an exponential function for the relationship between the degree of saturation and temperature 5 s w s wres 1 s wres exp t t f γ 2 where s w is the degree of saturation for the volumetric unfrozen water content s wres is the residual saturation corresponding to the residual volumetric unfrozen water content γ is the fitting parameter the mckenzie et al 2007 model is proposed on the assumption that the residual volumetric unfrozen water content is constant the relationship between the degree of saturation and the volumetric unfrozen water content is 6 s w θ u θ 0 similarly the relationship between the residual saturation and the residual volumetric unfrozen water content is 7 s wres θ res θ 0 substituting eqs 6 7 into eq 5 the expression of volumetric unfrozen water content is obtained as follows 8 θ u θ res θ 0 θ res exp t t f γ 2 t t f θ 0 t t f 2 5 kozlowski 2007 model kozlowski 2007 considered the relationship between the gravimetric unfrozen water content at a temperature below the freezing point and the total water content of the system and proposed a non linear piecewise gravimetric unfrozen water content model 9 w u w res t t res w res w 0 w res exp δ t f t t t res ε t res t t f w 0 t t f where t res is the temperature corresponding to w res δ and ε are the non interpretable coefficients which are responsible for fitting the function to the real values of gravimetric unfrozen water content in the range from t f to t res the volumetric unfrozen water content can also be approximately calculated by eq 3 the kozlowski 2007 model is developed on the assumption that all of the water remains in a liquid form when the soil temperature is above t f and the unabsorbed water is all frozen when the soil temperature is below t res actually there are other unfrozen water content models e g the fredlund and xing 1994 model related to the suction the wang et al 2017 model related to the pore size distribution the mu et al 2018 model related to the void ratio and the chai et al 2018 model related to the capillary water and bound water however these models are particularly complicated meanwhile these models are limited in practical application because numerous parameters need to be determined for the five commonly used models the accuracies of the unfrozen water content models are still not certain thus it is confused to decide which model should be used in practice to further distinguish the applicability of these models the root mean square error rmse in eq 10 and the average deviations ad in eq 11 are selected to evaluate the overall performance of the models the mathematical expressions are as follows 10 rmse i 1 n θ u ci θ u mi 2 n 11 ad 1 n 1 n θ u ci θ u mi where θ u ci and θ u mi are the calculated and measured volumetric unfrozen water contents respectively n is the number of measured data and i is a counter the rmse describes the absolute difference between the calculated and measured values the ad reflects the relative difference θ u ci overestimates θ u mi if ad 0 and θ u ci underestimates θ u mi θ u c i if ad 0 3 evaluation and discussion of models 3 1 mathematical formula comparison the frost heave would occur when the volume expansion generated due to the water ice phase transition exceeded the pores during the freezing process although the anderson and tice 1972 model the michalowski 1993 model and the kozlowski 2007 model are expressed by gravimetric unfrozen water content it is difficult to directly measure the gravimetric unfrozen water content during the freezing process on the contrary the unfrozen water content models proposed by the zhang et al 2017a and the mckenzie et al 2007 are expressed in volume the volumetric unfrozen water content can be directly measured during the freezing process to clearly illustrate the effect of model parameters on the variation of calculated volumetric unfrozen water contents for a given soil sample e g the soil no is w 3 table 1 the initial volumetric unfrozen water content is 35 60 the freezing point is 0 30 c and the residual volumetric unfrozen water content is 4 00 corresponding to the temperature of 15 00 c the variation of volumetric unfrozen water contents with temperature under different parameters are shown in fig 1 it can be seen that the parameters in the five models have different effects on the change process of the calculated volumetric unfrozen water content the volumetric unfrozen water content calculated by the zhang et al 2017a model increases with the parameter ω in the temperature range from t f to t k0 273 15 c fig 1a for the michalowski 1993 model the mckenzie et al 2007 mode and the kozlowski 2007 model the calculated unfrozen water contents vary with parameters from the initial water content to the residual unfrozen water content during the temperature range from t f to t res fig 1c e besides the variation characteristic of unfrozen water content calculated by the kozlowski 2007 model is determined by both the δ and the ε during the temperature range from t f to t res fig 1e the unfrozen water content calculated by the anderson and tice 1972 model is determined by both the α and β at the temperature below the freezing point fig 1b in practice the unfrozen water content of the models at a soil temperature t is affected by the boundary conditions when the soil temperature t approaches to the freezing point t f the boundary conditions for the zhang et al 2017a model eq 1 and the mckenzie et al 2007 model eq 8 are given in eqs 12a b and 13a b respectively 12a lim t t f θ u t θ 0 12b lim t t f θ u t 13a lim t t f θ u t θ 0 13b lim t t f θ u t 0 for the michalowski 1993 model eq 4 when the soil temperature t approaches to the freezing point t f the boundary conditions are 14a lim t t f w u t w 0 14b lim t t f w u t μ w 0 w res 0 for the kozlowski 2007 model eq 9 the derivative of the unfrozen water content is 15 w u t δ ε w 0 w res exp δ t f t t t res ε t f t ε 1 t res t f t t res 3 t res t t f when the soil temperature t approaches to the freezing point t f the boundary conditions for the kozlowski 2007 model are related to the ε therefore the boundary conditions at the temperature t f and t res are given in eqs 16a b and 17a b respectively 16a lim t t f w u t w 0 16b lim t t f w u t 0 ε 1 δ w 0 w res t f t res 2 ε 1 0 ε 1 17a lim t t res w u t w res 17b lim t t res w u t 0 actually the unfrozen water content rapidly decreases near the freezing point due to the drastic water ice phase transition therefore the maximum variation rate of the unfrozen water content curve occurs near the freezing point while for the mckenzie et al 2007 model eq 8 and the kozlowski 2007 model eq 9 ε 1 the derivative of the unfrozen water content curve at the freezing point is zero eq 13b and eq 16b which means that the unfrozen water content does not rapidly decrease near the freezing point it might be inconsistent with the actual variation of the unfrozen water contents during the freezing process 3 2 model evaluation by laboratory data 3 2 1 laboratory data description in this section the five unfrozen water content models are evaluated by a large database approximately 250 data points of laboratory experiments from 24 soil samples the characteristics of the soil samples e g location soil type specific density initial volumetric water content and tested method are listed in table 1 more details of the laboratory data could be found in the references low et al 1968 watanabe and mizoguchi 2002 yoshikawa and overduin 2005 azmatch et al 2012 wen et al 2012 ma et al 2015 kruse and darrow 2017 chai et al 2018 3 2 2 model evaluation table 2 shows the fitted parameters of the five models for the 24 soil samples the parameters θ 0 is determined by the initial volumetric water content the parameters θ res and t res are obtained by the residual volumetric unfrozen water content and its temperature during the freezing process respectively the parameters w 0 and w res are obtained according to the relationship between the volumetric unfrozen water content and the dry density eq 3 meanwhile the soils with different grain particles usually have different residual volumetric unfrozen water contents and the residual volumetric unfrozen water content is also related to soil temperature during the freezing process the michalowski 1993 model the mckenzie et al 2007 model and the kozlowski 2007 model contain the parameters θ res or w res so the unfrozen water content calculated by the three models is related to the corresponding temperature at which the unfrozen water content remains unchanged with the temperature i e the residual unfrozen water content thus the applications of the three models are sometimes limited fig 2 compares the calculated and measured volumetric unfrozen water contents of the 24 soil samples it can be seen that the volumetric unfrozen water content calculated by the zhang et al 2017a model matches well with the measured values the calculated values stand between the 10 deviation lines over the entire range of unfrozen water content for all soil samples fig 2a most of the volumetric unfrozen water contents calculated by the anderson and tice 1972 model are larger than the measured values in the range with low volumetric unfrozen water contents fig 2b it indicates that the calculated volumetric unfrozen water contents would be overestimated in this range for the anderson and tice 1972 model in addition for the michalowski 1993 model the mckenzie et al 2007 model and the kozlowski 2007 models the calculated volumetric unfrozen water contents are almost lower than the measured results in this range with low volumetric unfrozen water contents fig 2c e therefore the three models would underestimate the unfrozen water content in this range fig 2c e the differences between the calculated and measured results might be attributed to the parameters θ res w res and t res fig 3 shows the differences between the calculated and measured volumetric unfrozen water contents for different types of soils i e clay and silt from the reference ma et al 2015 it can be seen that the difference obtained by the zhang et al 2017a model is smaller than those by other models the differences calculated by the zhang et al 2017a model are within 1 0 for clay and within 0 5 for silt respectively fig 3a and b consequently the zhang et al 2017a model has relatively higher prediction accuracy for the clay and silt especially in the phase transition zone 1 0 c t 0 c fig 3a and b the rmse and ad of the 24 soil samples for the five models are shown in table 3 and table 4 respectively in general the rmses of the kozlowski 2007 model the mckenzie et al 2007 model the michalowski 1993 model and the anderson and tice 1972 model are obviously larger than those of the zhang et al 2017a model table 3 the relatively low values of rmses less than 1 60 for the zhang et al 2017a model indicate that the calculated volumetric unfrozen water contents agree well with the measured ones table 3 besides the ad values of the kozlowski 2007 model the mckenzie et al 2007 model and the michalowski 1993 model for most soil samples are negative therefore the three models overall underestimate volumetric unfrozen water content table 4 the ads of the zhang et al 2017a model for most soil samples are positive the absolute values of ad for the zhang et al 2017a models are greatly lower than those of other models and are much closer to zero table 4 thus the calculated results of the zhang et al 2017a model are superior to those of other models although it slightly overestimates the volumetric unfrozen water content for most of the soil samples 3 3 model evaluation by field observed data unlike volumetric unfrozen water contents calculated by laboratory data the volumetric unfrozen water contents of soils in field are greatly affected by many factors e g evaporation and rainfall meanwhile the hydro thermo boundary conditions in field are very complex the heat moisture interaction between atmosphere and soils is a long term process therefore it is important to evaluate whether the models are effective to predict the variation of unfrozen water content in field 3 3 1 field observed data description approximately 5 years field observed data from the published literature zhang et al 2017a are used to evaluate the field performance of the five models the field experiment site is near the chumaer river in the qinghai tibet plateau two soil layers are included within the depth of 13 00 m under the natural ground surface silty sand with gravel above 3 30 m and strongly weathered mudstone below 3 30 m the volumetric unfrozen water contents for silty sand are obtained at depth of 0 30 m under the gravel surface the moisture sensor with an accuracy of 2 0 is based on the tdr method the ground temperatures are measured by a thermistor at depth of 0 30 m the precision of the thermistor is 0 05 c pei et al 2019 the ground temperatures data are automatically collected with an interval of 1 0 h more details of the field experiment could be found in the reference zhang et al 2017a 3 3 2 model evaluation the observed ground temperatures under gravel surface 0 30 m depth are presented in fig 4 table 5 gives the fitted parameters of the five models for the field observed data the parameter θ res in the mckenzie et al 2007 model is 9 75 and the parameter w res in the michalowski 1993 model and the kozlowski 2007 model is 6 10 at the related temperature of 11 0 c meanwhile the parameter θ 0 and the parameter t f for the silty sand are 20 7 and 0 13 c respectively zhang et al 2017a comparison between the calculated and observed volumetric unfrozen water contents is illustrated in fig 5 it is found that all the models have great potential to calculate volumetric unfrozen water content of the silty sand under gravel surface 0 03 m depth however the anderson and tice 1972 model has singularities at the freezing point which is unacceptable for numerical calculation the singularities at freezing point might trigger non convergence problem in numerical simulations the non convergence of the anderson and tice 1972 model is also demonstrated by the research mckenzie et al 2007 the calculation error is relatively large in the range with lower volumetric unfrozen water content for the michalowski 1993 model the mckenzie et al 2007 model and the kozlowski 2007 model fig 5c e additionally the michalowski 1993 model the mckenzie et al 2007 model and the kozlowski 2007 model are not convenient to be used due to the complex parameters e g the residual gravimetric unfrozen water content for the michalowski 1993 model and the mckenzie et al 2007 model the residual volumetric unfrozen water content and its corresponding temperature for the kozlowski 2007 model moreover the calculated volumetric unfrozen water contents by the zhang et al 2017a model fit the observed data well r 2 0 916 fig 5a besides there is only one parameter related to soil characteristics in the zhang et al 2017a model which makes it convenient for application 4 conclusions this study evaluated the five widely used unfrozen water content models based on the published laboratory data and field observed data some conclusions are drawn 1 the parameters in the five models have different effects on the change process of the calculated volumetric unfrozen water content the anderson and tice 1972 model the michalowski 1993 model and the kozlowski 2007 model are expressed by gravimetric unfrozen water content while it is difficult to directly measure the gravimetric unfrozen water content during the freezing process the mckenzie et al 2007 model and the zhang et al 2017a model are expressed by volumetric unfrozen water content and it can be directly measured during the freezing process 2 although the zhang et al 2017a model slightly overestimates the volumetric unfrozen water content for some soil samples the parameters in this model are relatively simple therefore the zhang et al 2017a model can be more convenient in numerical simulations 3 all the models have great potential to calculate volumetric unfrozen water content of soils under the complex hydro thermo boundary conditions in field however the anderson and tice 1972 model has singularities at freezing point which might trigger convergence problem in numerical simulations declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this research was supported

6393,the coastal zone is not only a terrestrial marine buffer system but also the main site of the organic matter decomposition process which complicates the identification of the sources of bioactive elements c n and s and the factors that control c n s cycling here a multi isotope approach is developed to distinguish c n and s sources and the associated geochemical processes in a coastal aquifer system of the pearl river delta prd china the prd is characterized as a typical multilayer groundwater system with a reducing environment in the confined aquifers and an oxidizing environment in the unconfined aquifer for the groundwater samples from the unconfined aquifer the δ15n values showed that the ammonium and nitrate originated from manure and sewage the δ13c dic indicated that dissolved inorganic carbon dic was mainly derived from soil co2 and weathering of carbonate rocks and the δ34s and δ18o signals of sulfate suggested that so4 2 originated from the dissolution of continental evaporate the oxidizing environment and the positive relationship between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 suggested that nitrification and denitrification were the key factors influencing the transformation of nitrogen in the unconfined aquifer no obvious correlation between c n and s content and isotopic composition suggested c n s was loosely coupled in this aquifer for the groundwater samples in the confined aquifers the δd h2o and δ18o h2o signals suggested that partially confined groundwater samples were affected by seawater intrusion in the non seawater intrusion region nsi zone the c n and s content combined with c n and s isotopic composition indicated that ammonium was derived from the mineralization of organic matter sulfate mainly originated from rock weathering and dic mainly originated from carbonate mineral dissolution and the co2 produced by organic matter mineralization extremely high ch4 concentrations suggested the existence of methanogenesis while the molar ratio of ch4 ch4 1 α co2 indicated that both acetate fermentation and co2 reduction were ubiquitous co2 reduction had a stronger isotopic fractionation effect on the δ13c dic values thus the relatively high δ13c dic values were observed the electron acceptor was the key factor for organic matter mineralization and co2 acted as the main electron acceptor in the nsi zone accordingly acetate fermentation and co2 reduction became the key factors driving ammonium release in the nsi zone in the seawater intrusion region si zone ammonium was derived from the mineralization of organic matter sulfate was derived from the mixing of fresh water and seawater and dic was derived from carbonate mineral dissolution seawater and the co2 produced by organic matter mineralization the δ34s so4 2 showed a positive correlation with δ18o so4 2 and a negative correlation with so4 2 suggesting the existence of bacterial sulfate reduction bsr high ch4 concentrations also suggested the existence of methanogenesis the ch4 ch4 1 α co2 ratios indicated that co2 reduction existed in more than half of the confined groundwater samples in the si zone c n s was highly coupled in this region because both bsr and methanogenesis can increase the dic content while bsr enriches lighter carbon isotopes and methanogenesis enriches heavier carbon isotopes thus a wide range of δ13c dic values was found in si zone sulfate or both sulfate and co2 were the electron acceptors accordingly acetate fermentation sulfur reduction and co2 reduction worked together to promote ammonium release for the groundwater samples in the si zone however the exhaustion of sulfate will make co2 reduction the key factor for organic matter mineralization in the future keywords c n s cycling redox process organic matter

coastal areas ferguson and gleeson 2012 post 2005 small and nicholls 2003 as a terrestrial marine buffer system numerous studies have confirmed that multiple factors such as water rock interactions

jiao 2012 han et al 2014b coastal aquifers are also the main sites of the organic matter decomposition process which complicates the identification of the sources of the key bioactive elements c n and s and the factors that contribute to their hydrochemical composition santos et al 2012 eyre 2005 slomp and van cappellen 2004 however the cycling of key bioactive elements c n and s and the potential link between c n and s under complex coastal environments have been less investigated clarifying the geochemical processes of c n s is essential to assess the fragility of coastal aquifers and to perform reasonable water resource management stable isotopes are powerful tools for understanding the origins of groundwater and the sources of dissolved constituents as well as the biogeochemical processes within aquifers kendall 1998 cook and herczeg 2000 for example dual isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 have commonly been utilized to trace nitrogen sources and the occurrence of denitrification fukada et al 2003 choi et al 2007 hosono et al 2013 weng et al 2017 δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 are powerful tools for identifying sulfate sources and resolving biogeochemical processes

2010 although each individual environmental isotope method has been applied successfully and widely multi isotopic approaches play an important role in understanding biogeochemical processes in groundwater systems hosono et al 2014 caschetto et al 2017 for instance the use of combined δ13c dic δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 demonstrated the occurrence of sulfate reduction in urban groundwater jurado et al 2013 δ15n no3 δ34s so4 2 and δ13c dic have been proposed to identify the occurrence of denitrification hosono et al 2013 2014 for the bioactive elements c n and s in coastal aquifers multiple origins make the cycling of c n and s highly coupled and the combined use of multi isotope compositions can be more effective in understanding the sources of elements and the associated geochemical processes hosono et al 2014 2011 jurado et al 2013 the pearl river delta prd located in the coastal region of south china is characterized as a typical multilayer groundwater system with a reducing environment in confined aquifers and an oxidizing environment in unconfined aquifers in general the redox environment can control the behavior and cycling of c n and s appelo and dimier 2004 as well as the behavior and fate of many dissolved substances originating from either anthropogenic or natural sources in the groundwater environment ramesh kumar and riyazuddin 2012 hinkle and tesoriero 2014 kim et al 2014 the development of redox processes in groundwater generally begins with the reduction of oxygen followed by reduction of no3 mn iv fe iii so4 2 and co2 froelich et al 1979 schüring et al 2000 among these processes sulfate reduction and methanogenesis usually become the primary and predominant redox processes in the coastal aquifer due to the lack of o2 fe and mn seawater intrusion and an extremely high ammonium concentration up to 390 mg l originating from n bearing organic matter mineralization have been reported wang and jiao 2012 jiao et al 2010 wang et al 2013 accordingly carbon sulfur and nitrogen participate in element cycles and act as the electron donors or receptors in different phases of the redox process in this groundwater system however how the redox process controls the behavior of c n s and the potential link between c n and s are still unclear in coastal aquifer systems in this study hydrogeochemical and multi isotope techniques were

unconsolidated quaternary sediments fig 1b the proterozoic to cretaceous sediments consist of a mudstone pack sand glutenite conglomerate granite and gneiss complex b1 the quaternary stratigraphic sequence in prd is composed mostly of two terrestrial t1 and t2 and two marine m1 and m2 units as the earliest depositional stratigraphy the t2 layer is composed of medium coarse sand silty fine sand and gravel cobble and was formed before the last transgression in the late pleistocene however part of the t2 layer is missing due to strong weathering during the last glacial period the m2 layer is composed of silt and clay and formed during the last transgression in the late pleistocene the younger terrestrial sedimentary t1 is also composed of medium coarse sand silty fine sand and gravel cobble formed during the pleistocene the younger marine sedimentary m1 consists of silt and clay formed during the holocene furthermore the m1 layer is rich in organic matter because of massive ancient forests prevailing during this period the overlying strata t0 consisting of lime soil were formed during the holocene wu et al 2007 yim et al 2008 zong et al 2009 hydrogeologically the

an unconsolidated confined aquifer but will not be discussed here because its area is small b1 is the bedrock fissure confined aquifer m1 and m2 are the aquitards and the thickness of the m1 layer

mv in the confined aquifers t1 and b1 and from 19 60 to 271 30 mv in the unconfined aquifer t0 except for two wells sg02 and sg08 this indicates that the groundwater environment was reduced in the confined aquifers and that oxidation occurred in the unconfined aquifer table 1 the tds value varied from 0 11 g l to 0 60 g l and groundwater was of a hco3 ca or hco3 na type in the unconfined aquifer the tds varied from 0 09 g l to 27 56 g l in the confined aquifers and the groundwater was of a hco3 na or hco3 na ca when the tds value was 1 g l and became a cl na type when the tds value was 1 g l fig 2 4 2 c n and s contents the no3 n concentration was high up to 38 66 mg l in the unconfined aquifer and ranged from undetectable to 2 26 mg l in the confined aquifers the nh4 n concentration was low in the unconfined aquifer and high in the confined aquifers it ranged from undetected to 1 43 mg l in t0 up to 22 57 mg l in b1 and up to 64 36 mg l in t1 as a whole nitrate was the predominant species of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the t0 aquifer while ammonium was the predominant species in the t1 and b1 aquifers table 1 the average npoc concentration was 11 95 mg l in t0 11 18 mg l in t1 and 4 76 mg l in b1 the average hco3 content was 144 79 mg l in t0 and 144 91 mg l in b1 and was the highest in t1 ranging from 20 86 to 1028 17 mg l with an average value of 317 02 mg l table 1 the average co2 content was 329 94 mg l in t0 219 01 mg l in t1 and 449 06 mg l in b1 table 2 the ch4 concentration ranged from 0 02 to 0 22 mg l in t0 from 0 56 to 366 19 mg l in t1 and from 0 03 to 227 49 mg l in b1 it was higher in the confined aquifers than in the unconfined aquifers the high ch4 content suggested a reducing environment in the groundwater the sulfate content ranged from 3 76 to 109 61 mg l with an average value of 39 87 mg l in t0 from 0 29 to 409 46 mg l with an average value of 131 61 mg l in t1 and from 0 47 to 1246 84 mg l with an average value of 183 15 mg l in b1 obviously it was higher in the confined aquifers than in the unconfined aquifer 4 3 isotopic characteristics in groundwater 4 3 1 oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions the values of δ18o and δd ranged from 7 20 to 6 05 and from 47 82 to 36 79 respectively in the t0 aquifer from 6 06 to 2 03 and from 39 22 to 11 93 in the t1 aquifer from 7 32 to 3 43 and from 45 10 to 22 44 in the b1 aquifer the δ18o and δd values of the confined aquifers were much higher than those of the unconfined aquifer 4 3 2 nitrate and ammonium isotopic compositions the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in the t0 aquifer ranged from 9 25 to 31 99 and from 2 83 to 16 74 respectively the δ15n nh4 values ranged from 16 77 to 34 64 in t0 from 1 99 to 9 98 with an average value of 5 62 in t1 and from 3 18 to 6 79 with an average value of 5 02 in the b1 aquifer table 2 despite the detectable nh4 in a few sites in the unconfined aquifer t0 its δ15n nh4 value was higher than that in the confined aquifers t1 and b1 4 3 3 sulphate isotopic compositions the δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 values in the study area ranged from 4 32 to 32 64 and from 4 22 to 16 56 respectively table 2 there was a significant difference between the sulfur and oxygen isotopic compositions among the different aquifers the δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 values varied from 10 28 to 13 78 and from 4 22 to 5 76 respectively in the t0 aquifer and from 9 56 to 20 30 and from 5 85 to 9 27 in the t1 aquifer and they increased to 32 64 and 16 56 respectively in the b1 aquifer 4 3 4 dic isotopic composition the δ13c dic value ranged from 9 64 to 15 10 with an average value of 11 97 in the t0 aquifer from 13 69 to 7 01 with an average value of 6 73 in the t1 aquifer and from 15 72 to 15 43 with an average value of 4 69 in the b1 aquifer table 2 the δ13c dic signatures revealed different features in the study area where carbon isotopes were enriched more in the confined aquifers than in the unconfined aquifer 5 discussion 5 1 origins of groundwater isotopic ratios of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δd have been widely applied to determine the origins of groundwater as shown in fig 3 the unconfined groundwater samples were basically distributed around the local meteoric water line lmwl indicating its present precipitation origin the values of δ18o and δd in the confined aquifers deviated from the lmwl and fell along the freshwater seawater mixing line indicating that the t1 and b1 aquifers were affected by seawater intrusion based on mixing eq 1 the fraction of seawater contributions to confined groundwater ranged from 1 to 88 40 table 3 accordingly groundwater can be divided into a seawater intrusion zone si zone and a non seawater intrusion zone nsi zone as shown in fig 4 5 2 origins of n c and s 5 2 1 nitrogen different ammonium sources showed different isotopic features the δ15n nh4 values vary from 2 to 2 in synthetic fertilizer from 3 to 1 in nitrogen fixation from 18 to 32 5 in feedlot runoff from 10 to 20 in manure septic effluents and from 2 to 8 in natural organic matter wang et al 2013 clark and fritz 1997 böhlke and shinn 2003 lingle 2013 norrman et al 2015 the δ15n nh4 signal indicated natural organic nitrogen sources of ammonium in the t1 and b1 aquifers fig 5 a which is consistent with previous studies wang and jiao 2012 jiao et al 2010 wang et al 2013 high ammonium is usually associated with high salinity because some major cations introduced by seawater show relatively stronger affinity and cause the release of exchangeable nh4 from sediment to water the remarkable negative relationship between mmg react and nh4 r2 0 66 in the t1 aquifer fig 5b confirmed this conclusion there are two possible ammonium sources for the t0 aquifer feedlot runoff or manure septic effluents and natural ammonium sources that diffuse from the m1 layer as mentioned above the δ15n values of ammonium from feedlot runoff and manure septic effluents range from 10 to 32 5 while the δ15n nh4 values of residual natural ammonium show similar ranges 14 2 to 27 1 as the isotope effects caused by marine ammonia oxidizing bacteria are 14 2 to 19 1 casciotti et al 2003 the overlap in values makes source apportionment difficult nevertheless the stoichiometric relation between nh4 and an inert trace can be used to provide further discrimination as previous studies showed that the m1 layer also preserved seawater and released both ammonium and salinity from the m1 layer to the aquifer via downward flow or diffusion the molar ratios of nh4 cl for the confined groundwater samples with extremely high ammonium contents ranged from 0 005 to 0 017 while the molar ratios of nh4 cl for t0 aquifer ranged from 0 018 to 0 082 and the molar ratios of nh4 n no3 n cl ranged from 0 062 to 2 023 the higher ratios of n cl suggested a tiny part or no natural ammonium source diffusion from the m1 layer to the t0 aquifer manure septic effluent sources of ammonium in the t0 aquifer were consistent with the real situation because of the frequent use of manure and the existence of septic tanks in the study area nevertheless the δ15n nh4 values in the t0 aquifer were significantly higher than those in the manure septic effluents the extremely low ammonium content and similar values between δ15n nh4 and δ15n no3 coupled with an oxidative environment in the t0 aquifer suggest the existence of nitrification it was difficult to trace the nitrate origin according to the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values because of the existence of nitrification the extremely low ammonium concentration suggests that ammonium transformed to nitrate during the nitrification process thus the δ15n values of nitrate should be similar to the δ15n values of the precursors nitrification produced no3 with δ18o values ranging from 3 04 to 3 80 2 3 of o no3 came from o h2o and 1 3 came from o o2 23 5 however the measured δ18o values were obviously higher than the calculated values due to denitrification causing the δ15n and δ18o values to increase in parallel r2 0 66 fig 5c in summary the nitrate in the t0 aquifer mainly originated from nitrification production or mixing of no3 produced by nitrification and no3 in manure septic effluents 5 2 2 carbon previous studies have shown that dic in the open groundwater system may have three primary sources atmospheric co2 soil co2 and the dissolution of carbonate minerals li et al 2008 li et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 the δ13c values of atmospheric co2 g were approximately 7 and approximately 8 when co2 g dissolved in water soil co2 was derived from the heterotrophic oxidation of soil organic matter or respiration of plant roots and its c isotopic composition was controlled by the relative proportion of c3 over c4 plants and the rate of co2 diffusion yao et al 2007 research has reported that the δ13c poc signatures were approximately 25 in the xijiang river basin southwest china li et al 2008 and the δ13c values of soil co2 were approximately 21 because the fractionation caused by the diffusion of 12co2 g was 4 4 the δ13c values of carbonate minerals were approximately 0 consequently δ13c dic values that resulted from the dissolution of carbonate rock and soil co2 should be 11 2 li et al 2010 because the hco3 was derived in approximately equal proportions from co2 aq δ13c 22 in co2 aq and caco3 δ13c 0 the δ13c dic values in the t0 aquifer were consistent with the results from the dissolution of carbonate rock and soil co2 in addition the significant positive correlation between hco3 and ca2 r2 0 72 fig 6 b also indicated the weathering of carbonate in buried confined aquifers the contributions of atmospheric and soil co2 become quite limited compared with other sources as previously mentioned the mineralization of rich organic matter in a strong reducing environment contributes to the major carbon pool for the confined groundwater in the nsi zone carbonate mineral dissolution with co2 produced by c mineralization was the main hco3 source for the groundwater in the si zone dic sources didn t followed the mixing behavior of seawater and freshwater fig s1 meanwhile the δ13c dic values did not show a typical increasing pattern with salinity conservative mixing of freshwater with more negative δ13c values and marine water with δ13c values close to 0 fig 6a fig s1 which also indicated other carbon sources in the si zone the strong reducing environment and intrusion of seawater suggested the possible existence of methanogenesis and sulfate reduction which produced more hco3 in the confined aquifers the related reaction will be discussed next 5 2 3 sulfur concerning the sulfate concentration and δ34s signals the narrow isotope composition was consistent with the isotopic composition of continental evaporate suggesting that so4 2 originated from the dissolution of continental evaporite in the t0 aquifer mizota and sasaki 1996 for the confined groundwater samples in the nsi zone the sulfate concentration and δ34s and δ18o signals suggested that sulfur was also derived from evaporite dissolution for the confined groundwater samples in the si zone even though seawater intrusion was proven the δ34s and δ18o values in the t1 and b1 aquifers were obviously higher than those in modern seawater 21 for δ34s and 9 5 for δ18o mizota and sasaki 1996 in addition the so4 2 content was remarkably decreased as the fsea increased fig 7 which combined with the negative relationship between δ34s and so4 2 and the significant positive correlation between δ34s and δ18o suggests the existence of a sulfate reduction process in the si zone 5 3 redox processes in coastal groundwater system 5 3 1 redox conditions and forms of c n and s the redox state of groundwater has been shown to be a primary control of element species such as n c and s generally positive eh values indicate an oxidized environment while negative eh values suggest a strongly reduced environment as shown in fig 9 the shallow aquifer t0 showed an oxidized state and the dominant n species were n2 or no3 sulfur and carbon in the t0 aquifer mainly acted as so4 2 hco3 and h2co3 in contrast the confined aquifers t1 and b1 showed a reduced environment n species were dominant as nh4 in the t1 aquifer and as n2 or nh4 in the b1 aquifer sulfur was in the form of so4 2 in most of the confined groundwater samples and hs or h2s in a small portion of the confined groundwater samples the carbon species were co2 or ch2o in most of the confined groundwater and ch4 in parts of the confined aquifer 5 3 2 geochemical evolution under different redox conditions the distinct redox conditions in the unconfined and confined aquifers resulted in the different geochemical evolutions of c n and s in the study area for the unconfined t0 aquifer a low ammonium content coupled with the oxidizing environment suggested that nitrification may be the key factor influencing the transformation of nitrogen however the positive relationship between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 r2 0 66 fig 5c indicated that denitrification was also crucial to nitrogen transformation dic mainly originated from soil co2 and rock weathering and sulfate originated from the dissolution of continental evaporate no obvious correlation between c n and s content and isotopic composition suggested c n s was loosely coupled in this aquifer figs s2 s4 for the confined t1 and b1 aquifers organic matter mineralization under a stronger redox environment has been proven jiao et al 2010 generally the mineralization of organic matter can be divided into three steps first fermentative bacteria hydrolyze the polysaccharides and convert them into alcohols fatty acids and h2 second hydrogen producing acetogenic bacteria degrade the alcohols and fatty acids further to acetic acid formic acid h2 and co2 finally the acetate formate and h2 produced in the first and second stages are oxidized by an electron acceptor appelo and postma 2005 blaser and conrad 2016 the fermentative intermediated acetate formate and h2 consumed by the electron acceptor were the key factors driving the mineralization of organic matter in the t1 and b1 aquifers the lack of do no3 fe iii and mn iv suggested that sulfate and co2 may be the main electron acceptors in the confined groundwater system sulfate reduction was catalyzed by various strains of bacteria according to the overall reaction appelo and postma 2005 4 2 ch 2 o so 4 2 2 hco 3 h 2 s here ch2o was used as a simplified representation of organic matter the occurrence of sulfate reduction in aquifers depends on both the content of organic matter and the supply of sulfate as previously described the important local source of sulfate was seawater intrusion the reaction amounts of so4 2 are shown in table 3 and the so4 2 contents were only depleted in the si zone in most cases gypsum precipitation may be the main reason for the so4 2 decrease in the groundwater system however the saturation indices of gypsum calculated by phreeqc table s1 suggested that no gypsum precipitation occurred and sulfate reduction became the major sink of so4 2 in the si zone in addition the negative correlation between the so4 2 contents and δ34s so4 2 and the positive correlation between δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 fig 8 in the si zone also indicated the occurrence of sulfate reduction the high ch4 contents in the confined aquifers indicate the formation of methane in general the predominant processes of methane formation were the fermentation of acetate eq 5 and the reduction of co2 by free hydrogen eq 6 appelo and postma 2005 5 ch 3 cooh ch 4 co 2 6 co 2 4 h 2 2 h 2 o ch 4 the isotopic fractionation effects of the two processes were significantly different the overall c isotopic fractionation factors ε for acetate fermentation and co2 reduction were 7 35 and 30 90 respectively blaser and conrad 2016 huang and hall 2018 because the mineralization of organic carbon contributed to most of the carbon pool the mass balance of carbon could be used to evaluate the dominant processes in the study area under the assumption that there is congruent dissolution of carbonate half of hco3 originated from dissolved co2 g then the molar ratio of ch4 ch4 1 α co2 which we named the fermentation factor ff can be used to evaluate whether co2 reduction occurs 1 α co2 represent all co2 produced from organic matter mineralization and α 0 represent that co2 mainly originate from acetate fermentation this co2 molar ratio was equal to ch4 molar ratio α 0 represent that 1 1 α percent of co2 derive from acetate fermentation and α 1 α percent of co2 derive from the mixing of the first and second step of organic matter mineralization obviously if ff 0 5 there exist the reduction of co2 as acetate fermentation produced the same amount of co2 and ch4 if ff 0 5 it is hard to judge the existence of co2 reduction it was found that ff varied from 0 00 to 0 77 for the confined groundwater samples in the nsi zone and from 0 00 to 0 96 for the confined groundwater samples in the si zone only two samples in the nsi zone and almost half of the samples in the si zone had ff values higher than 0 5 indicated the occurrence of co2 reduction for the confined groundwater samples with ff lower than 0 5 in the nsi zone we applied a two end member mixing equation to assume that 1 ch4 mainly originates from acetate fermentation eq 5 2 the mass balance equations eq 7 can be used to calculate the c isotopic composition and 3 the organic starting material has δ13c values of 25 δ13c om and no isotopic fractionation occurs during the first and second step of organic matter mineralization 7 δ 13 c om 1 δ 13 c ch 4 0 5 δ 13 c co 2 0 5 if εacetate ch4 is 35 huang and hall 2018 then the δ13c value of ch4 is 60 and the δ13c value of co2 produced becomes 10 1 25 0 5 25 35 0 5 10 accordingly the δ13c values of the co2 pool turn to 25 00 to 4 99 δ13c co2 pool 10 1 1 α 25 α 1 α and the δ13c dic values should be 22 97 to 4 52 δ13c dic δ13c caco3 1 2 h c o 3 1 α c o 2 1 2 h c o 3 δ13c co2 pool 1 α c o 2 1 α c o 2 1 2 h c o 3 clearly the estimated value of δ13c dic was lower than the measured values 15 72 to 5 63 except for samples t1 and b11 suggesting that the co2 reduction was also ubiquitous and that it had a strong isotopic fractionation effect on the δ13c dic values for the confined groundwater samples with ff lower than 0 5 in the si zone it is difficult to evaluate the isotopic fractionation effect of acetate fermentation because sulfate reduction also had a strong influence on δ13c dic values even when sulfate reduction depleted the heavy carbon isotope sample b10 with a low ff value 0 18 also showed an extremely high δ13c dic value 7 12 indicating that co2 reduction also exists in partially confined groundwater samples with low ff values in the si zone 5 4 relationship among n c and s in the reduced coastal aquifer generally sulfate reduction and methanogenesis increase the dic content while heavy carbon isotopes are depleted by sulfate reduction and enriched by methanogenesis the influential degree of methanogenesis and sulfate reduction on δ13c dic values can be observed through the relationship between mso4 react and ch4 groundwater samples can be divided into four classes according to mso4 react and ch4 values fig 10 the groundwater samples in class i showed extremely low ch4 concentrations and mso4 react values obviously the groundwater samples in class i all shallow groundwater samples and the partially confined groundwater samples in the nsi zone were not affected by methanogenesis and sulfate reduction the groundwater samples in class ii located in the nsi zone showed that the ch4 concentration increased without changes in mso4 react values and the mso4 react values were approximately 0 generally the δ13c values increased with increasing ch4 since the δ13c values were greatly affected by methanogenesis however some samples such as b11 with a high ch4 content showed a light c isotope composition δ13c 11 19 while sample b08 with a relatively lower ch4 content showed a heavy c isotope composition δ13c 15 43 this phenomenon can be attributed to the dic content and methanogenesis processes sample b08 showed an extremely low dic content 1 66 mmol l and high ff values 0 77 suggesting that co2 reduction strongly increases the δ13c dic values sample b11 showed a high dic content 7 09 mmol l and moderate ff values 0 46 suggesting that dic is mainly derived from the dissolution of carbonate rock and co2 produced by acetate fermentation the groundwater samples in class iii located in the si zone showed that the mso4 react values decreased with little change in the ch4 concentration and the ch4 content was very low these samples featured enriched 34s so4 2 and 18o so4 2 as well as depleted 13c dic since groundwater was greatly influenced by sulfate reduction the δ13c value decreased as the reactive sulfate content decreased nevertheless the relatively light c isotope composition of b12 10 33 was hard to explain because of its relatively low ch4 content moderate mso4 react values and moderate dic content 2 00 mmol l the groundwater samples in class iv located in the si zone showed that the ch4 concentration increased with decreasing mso4 react these samples featured enriched values of 34s so4 2 and 18o so4 2 and a wide range of δ13c dic since the groundwater was affected by both methanogenesis and sulfate reduction the δ13c value mainly depended on the ch4 content mso4 react and source proportion of dic in general the higher the δ13c value was the stronger the impact of methanogenesis as mentioned the release of ammonium resulted from organic matter mineralization in the confined aquifers in the study region co2 acted as the main electron acceptor in class ii sulfate acted as the main electron acceptor in class iii and sulfate or both sulfate and co2 acted as the electron acceptors in class iv accordingly acetate fermentation and co2 reduction became the key factors driving ammonium release for the groundwater samples in class ii in the nsi zone sulfur reduction became the key factor driving ammonium release for the groundwater samples in class iii in the si zone acetate fermentation sulfur reduction and co2 reduction worked together to promote ammonium release for the groundwater samples in class iv in the si zone as shown in fig 11 the ammonium content in the t1 aquifer has a significant negative relationship with mso42 react r2 0 83 and a positive relationship with the ch4 content r2 0 46 this indicates that sulfur reduction and methane formation had a closed link for the release of ammonium in the study region although the marine source of so4 2 had a significant influence on the release of nitrogen and the transformation of carbon the sulfate content has been consumed completely in most of the confined aquifers tables 1 and 3 and co2 reduction may become the key factor in organic matter mineralization and ammonium release in the confined aquifer in the future 6 conclusion the features of carbon sulfur and nitrogen and the controlling processes in the coastal groundwater system in the south part of pearl river delta were studied and the following conclusions were drawn for the oxidizing unconfined aquifer ammonium and nitrate originated from manure and sewage dic was mainly derived from soil co2 and weathering of carbonate rocks and sulfate originated from the dissolution of continental evaporate nitrification and denitrification were the key factors influencing the transformation of nitrogen and c n s was loosely coupled in the unconfined aquifer for the groundwater samples in reducing confined aquifers without seawater intrusion ammonium was derived from the mineralization of organic matter sulfate mainly originated from rock weathering and dic mainly originated from carbonate mineral dissolution and the co2 produced by organic matter mineralization acetate fermentation and co2 reduction were ubiquitous in this region accordingly acetate fermentation and co2 reduction became the key factors driving ammonium release in the nsi zone for the groundwater samples in reducing confined aquifer with seawater intrusion ammonium was derived from the mineralization of organic matter sulfate was derived from the mixing of fresh water and seawater and dic was derived from carbonate mineral dissolution seawater and the co2 produced by organic matter mineralization c n s was highly coupled in si zone because both bsr and methanogenesis can increase the dic content while bsr enriches lighter carbon isotopes and methanogenesis enriches heavier carbon isotopes thus a wide range of δ13c dic values was found in si zone sulfate or both sulfate and co2 were the electron acceptors in the si zone accordingly acetate fermentation sulfur reduction and co2 reduction worked together to promote ammonium release for the groundwater samples in the si zone however the exhaustion of sulfate in si zone will make co2 reduction the key factor for organic matter

6393,the coastal zone is not only a terrestrial marine buffer system but also the main site of the organic matter decomposition process which complicates the identification of the sources of bioactive elements c n and s and the factors that control c n s cycling here a multi isotope approach is developed to distinguish c n and s sources and the associated geochemical processes in a coastal aquifer system of the pearl river delta prd china the prd is characterized as a typical multilayer groundwater system with a reducing environment in the confined aquifers and an oxidizing environment in the unconfined aquifer for the groundwater samples from the unconfined aquifer the δ15n values showed that the ammonium and nitrate originated from manure and sewage the δ13c dic indicated that dissolved inorganic carbon dic was mainly derived from soil co2 and weathering of carbonate rocks and the δ34s and δ18o signals of sulfate suggested that so4 2 originated from the dissolution of continental evaporate the oxidizing environment and the positive relationship between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 suggested that nitrification and denitrification were the key factors influencing the transformation of nitrogen in the unconfined aquifer no obvious correlation between c n and s content and isotopic composition suggested c n s was loosely coupled in this aquifer for the groundwater samples in the confined aquifers the δd h2o and δ18o h2o signals suggested that partially confined groundwater samples were affected by seawater intrusion in the non seawater intrusion region nsi zone the c n and s content combined with c n and s isotopic composition indicated that ammonium was derived from the mineralization of organic matter sulfate mainly originated from rock weathering and dic mainly originated from carbonate mineral dissolution and the co2 produced by organic matter mineralization extremely high ch4 concentrations suggested the existence of methanogenesis while the molar ratio of ch4 ch4 1 α co2 indicated that both acetate fermentation and co2 reduction were ubiquitous co2 reduction had a stronger isotopic fractionation effect on the δ13c dic values thus the relatively high δ13c dic values were observed the electron acceptor was the key factor for organic matter mineralization and co2 acted as the main electron acceptor in the nsi zone accordingly acetate fermentation and co2 reduction became the key factors driving ammonium release in the nsi zone in the seawater intrusion region si zone ammonium was derived from the mineralization of organic matter sulfate was derived from the mixing of fresh water and seawater and dic was derived from carbonate mineral dissolution seawater and the co2 produced by organic matter mineralization the δ34s so4 2 showed a positive correlation with δ18o so4 2 and a negative correlation with so4 2 suggesting the existence of bacterial sulfate reduction bsr high ch4 concentrations also suggested the existence of methanogenesis the ch4 ch4 1 α co2 ratios indicated that co2 reduction existed in more than half of the confined groundwater samples in the si zone c n s was highly coupled in this region because both bsr and methanogenesis can increase the dic content while bsr enriches lighter carbon isotopes and methanogenesis enriches heavier carbon isotopes thus a wide range of δ13c dic values was found in si zone sulfate or both sulfate and co2 were the electron acceptors accordingly acetate fermentation sulfur reduction and co2 reduction worked together to promote ammonium release for the groundwater samples in the si zone however the exhaustion of sulfate will make co2 reduction the key factor for organic matter mineralization in the future keywords c n s cycling redox process organic matter multi isotope coastal aquifer 1 introduction coastal aquifers are a nexus of the world s oceanic and hydrologic ecosystems and provide water resources for more than one billion people living in coastal areas ferguson and gleeson 2012 post 2005 small and nicholls 2003 as a terrestrial marine buffer system numerous studies have confirmed that multiple factors such as water rock interactions seawater intrusion anthropogenic activities and depositional sequences control the chemical characteristics of coastal aquifers jayasingha et al 2013 han et al 2014a barlow and reichard 2010 wang and jiao 2012 han et al 2014b coastal aquifers are also the main sites of the organic matter decomposition process which complicates the identification of the sources of the key bioactive elements c n and s and the factors that contribute to their hydrochemical composition santos et al 2012 eyre 2005 slomp and van cappellen 2004 however the cycling of key bioactive elements c n and s and the potential link between c n and s under complex coastal environments have been less investigated clarifying the geochemical processes of c n s is essential to assess the fragility of coastal aquifers and to perform reasonable water resource management stable isotopes are powerful tools for understanding the origins of groundwater and the sources of dissolved constituents as well as the biogeochemical processes within aquifers kendall 1998 cook and herczeg 2000 for example dual isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 have commonly been utilized to trace nitrogen sources and the occurrence of denitrification fukada et al 2003 choi et al 2007 hosono et al 2013 weng et al 2017 δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 are powerful tools for identifying sulfate sources and resolving biogeochemical processes

2010 although each individual environmental isotope method has been applied successfully and widely multi isotopic approaches play an important role in understanding biogeochemical processes in groundwater systems hosono et al 2014 caschetto et al 2017 for instance the use of combined δ13c dic δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 demonstrated the occurrence of sulfate reduction in urban groundwater

multiple origins make the cycling of c n and s highly coupled and the combined use of multi isotope compositions can be more effective in understanding the sources of elements and the associated

as well as the behavior and fate of many dissolved substances originating from either anthropogenic or natural sources in the groundwater environment ramesh kumar and riyazuddin 2012 hinkle and tesoriero 2014 kim et al 2014 the development of redox processes in groundwater generally begins with the reduction of oxygen followed by reduction of no3 mn iv fe iii so4 2 and co2 froelich et al 1979 schüring et al 2000 among these processes sulfate reduction and methanogenesis usually become the primary and predominant redox processes in the coastal aquifer due to the lack of o2 fe and mn seawater intrusion and an extremely high ammonium concentration up to 390 mg l originating from n bearing organic matter mineralization have been reported wang and jiao 2012 jiao et al 2010 wang et al 2013 accordingly carbon sulfur and nitrogen participate in element cycles and act as the electron donors or receptors in different phases of the redox process in this groundwater system however how the redox process controls the behavior of c n s and the potential link between c n and s are still unclear in coastal aquifer systems in this study hydrogeochemical and multi isotope techniques were

delta region prd and covers an area of approximately 1314 km2 fig 1 a it has a subtropical monsoon humid climate with an annual average temperature of 21 9 c and the yearly average rainfall ranges from 1800 to 2200 mm most of which occurs from april to september the geology of the study area is mainly composed of a basement of proterozoic cretaceous and paleogene sedimentary rock overlying unconsolidated quaternary sediments fig 1b the proterozoic to cretaceous sediments consist of a mudstone pack sand glutenite conglomerate granite and gneiss complex b1 the quaternary stratigraphic sequence in prd is composed mostly of two terrestrial t1 and t2 and two marine m1 and m2 units as the earliest depositional stratigraphy the t2 layer is composed of medium coarse sand silty fine sand and gravel cobble and was formed before the last transgression in the late pleistocene however part of the t2 layer is missing due to strong weathering during the last glacial period the m2 layer is composed of silt and clay and formed during the last transgression in the late pleistocene the younger terrestrial sedimentary t1 is also composed of medium coarse sand silty fine sand and gravel cobble formed during the pleistocene the younger marine sedimentary m1 consists of silt and clay formed during the holocene furthermore the m1 layer is rich in organic matter because of massive ancient forests prevailing during this period the overlying strata t0 consisting of lime soil were formed during the holocene wu et al 2007 yim et al 2008 zong et al 2009 hydrogeologically the

mv in the confined aquifers t1 and b1 and from 19 60 to 271 30 mv in the unconfined aquifer t0 except for two wells sg02 and sg08 this indicates that the groundwater environment was reduced in the confined aquifers and that oxidation occurred in the unconfined aquifer table 1 the tds value varied from 0 11 g l to 0 60 g l and groundwater was of a hco3 ca or hco3 na type in the unconfined aquifer the tds varied from 0 09 g l to 27 56 g l in the confined aquifers and the groundwater was of a hco3 na or hco3 na ca when the tds value was 1 g l and became a cl na type when the tds value was 1 g l fig 2 4 2 c n and s contents the no3 n concentration was high up to 38 66 mg l in the unconfined aquifer and ranged from undetectable to 2 26 mg l in the confined aquifers the nh4 n concentration was low in the unconfined aquifer and high in the confined aquifers it ranged from undetected to 1 43 mg l in t0 up to 22 57 mg l in b1 and up to 64 36 mg l in t1 as a whole nitrate was the predominant species of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the t0 aquifer while ammonium was the predominant species in the t1 and b1 aquifers table 1 the average npoc concentration was 11 95 mg l in t0 11 18 mg l in t1 and 4 76 mg l in b1 the average hco3 content was 144 79 mg l in t0 and 144 91 mg l in b1 and was the highest in t1 ranging from 20 86 to 1028 17 mg l with an average value of 317 02 mg l table 1 the average co2 content was 329 94 mg l in t0 219 01 mg l in t1 and 449 06 mg l in b1 table 2 the ch4 concentration ranged from 0 02 to 0 22 mg l in t0 from 0 56 to 366 19 mg l in t1 and from 0 03 to 227 49 mg l in b1 it was higher in the confined aquifers than in the unconfined aquifers the high ch4 content suggested a reducing environment in the groundwater the sulfate content ranged from 3 76 to 109 61 mg l with an average value of 39 87 mg l in t0 from 0 29 to 409 46 mg l with an average value of 131 61 mg l in t1 and from 0 47 to 1246 84 mg l with an average value of 183 15 mg l in b1 obviously it was higher in the confined aquifers than in the unconfined aquifer 4 3 isotopic characteristics in groundwater 4 3 1 oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions the values of δ18o and δd ranged from 7 20 to 6 05 and from 47 82 to 36 79 respectively in the t0 aquifer from 6 06 to 2 03 and from 39 22 to 11 93 in the t1 aquifer from 7 32 to 3 43 and from 45 10 to 22 44 in the b1 aquifer the δ18o and δd values of the confined aquifers were much higher than those of the unconfined aquifer 4 3 2 nitrate and ammonium isotopic compositions the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in the t0 aquifer ranged from 9 25 to 31 99 and from 2 83 to 16 74 respectively the δ15n nh4 values ranged from 16 77 to 34 64 in t0 from 1 99 to 9 98 with an average value of 5 62 in t1 and from 3 18 to 6 79 with an average value of 5 02 in the b1 aquifer table 2 despite the detectable nh4 in a few sites in the unconfined aquifer t0 its δ15n nh4 value was higher than that in the confined aquifers t1 and b1 4 3 3 sulphate isotopic compositions the δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 values in the study area ranged from 4 32 to 32 64 and from 4 22 to 16 56 respectively table 2 there was a significant difference between the sulfur and oxygen isotopic compositions among the different aquifers the δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 values varied from 10 28 to 13 78 and from 4 22 to 5 76 respectively in the t0 aquifer and from 9 56 to 20 30 and from 5 85 to 9 27 in the t1 aquifer and they increased to 32 64 and 16 56 respectively in the b1 aquifer 4 3 4 dic isotopic composition the δ13c dic value ranged from 9 64 to 15 10 with an average value of 11 97 in the t0 aquifer from 13 69 to 7 01 with an average value of 6 73 in the t1 aquifer and from 15 72 to 15 43 with an average value of 4 69 in the b1 aquifer table 2 the δ13c dic signatures revealed different features in the study area where carbon isotopes were enriched more in the confined aquifers than in the unconfined aquifer 5 discussion 5 1 origins of groundwater isotopic ratios of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δd have been widely applied to determine the origins of groundwater as shown in fig 3 the unconfined groundwater samples were basically distributed around the local meteoric water line lmwl indicating its present precipitation origin the values of δ18o and δd in the confined aquifers deviated from the lmwl and fell along the freshwater seawater mixing line indicating that the t1 and b1 aquifers were affected by seawater intrusion based on mixing eq 1 the fraction of seawater contributions to confined groundwater ranged from 1 to 88 40 table 3 accordingly groundwater can be divided into a seawater intrusion zone si zone and a non seawater intrusion zone nsi zone as shown in fig 4 5 2 origins of n c and s 5 2 1 nitrogen different ammonium sources showed different isotopic features the δ15n nh4 values vary from 2 to 2 in synthetic fertilizer from 3 to 1 in nitrogen fixation from 18 to 32 5 in feedlot runoff from 10 to 20 in manure septic effluents and from 2 to 8 in natural organic matter wang et al 2013 clark and fritz 1997 böhlke and shinn 2003 lingle 2013 norrman et al 2015 the δ15n nh4 signal indicated natural organic nitrogen sources of ammonium in the t1 and b1 aquifers fig 5 a which is consistent with previous studies wang and jiao 2012 jiao et al 2010 wang et al 2013 high ammonium is usually associated with high salinity because some major cations introduced by seawater show relatively stronger affinity and cause the release of exchangeable nh4 from sediment to water the remarkable negative relationship between mmg react and nh4 r2 0 66 in the t1 aquifer fig 5b confirmed this conclusion there are two possible ammonium sources for the t0 aquifer feedlot runoff or manure septic effluents and natural ammonium sources that diffuse from the m1 layer as mentioned above the δ15n values of ammonium from feedlot runoff and manure septic effluents range from 10 to 32 5 while the δ15n nh4 values of residual natural ammonium show similar ranges 14 2 to 27 1 as the isotope effects caused by marine ammonia oxidizing bacteria are 14 2 to 19 1 casciotti et al 2003 the overlap in values makes source apportionment difficult nevertheless the stoichiometric relation between nh4 and an inert trace can be used to provide further discrimination as previous studies showed that the m1 layer also preserved seawater and released both ammonium and salinity from the m1 layer to the aquifer via downward flow or diffusion the molar ratios of nh4 cl for the confined groundwater samples with extremely high ammonium contents ranged from 0 005 to 0 017 while the molar ratios of nh4 cl for t0 aquifer ranged from 0 018 to 0 082 and the molar ratios of nh4 n no3 n cl ranged from 0 062 to 2 023 the higher ratios of n cl suggested a tiny part or no natural ammonium source diffusion from the m1 layer to the t0 aquifer manure septic effluent sources of ammonium in the t0 aquifer were consistent with the real situation because of the frequent use of manure and the existence of septic tanks in the study area nevertheless the δ15n nh4 values in the t0 aquifer were significantly higher than those in the manure septic effluents the extremely low ammonium content and similar values between δ15n nh4 and δ15n no3 coupled with an oxidative environment in the t0 aquifer suggest the existence of nitrification it was difficult to trace the nitrate origin according to the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values because of the existence of nitrification the extremely low ammonium concentration suggests that ammonium transformed to nitrate during the nitrification process thus the δ15n values of nitrate should be similar to the δ15n values of the precursors nitrification produced no3 with δ18o values ranging from 3 04 to 3 80 2 3 of o no3 came from o h2o and 1 3 came from o o2 23 5 however the measured δ18o values were obviously higher than the calculated values due to denitrification causing the δ15n and δ18o values to increase in parallel r2 0 66 fig 5c in summary the nitrate in the t0 aquifer mainly originated from nitrification production or mixing of no3 produced by nitrification and no3 in manure septic effluents 5 2 2 carbon previous studies have shown that dic in the open groundwater system may have three primary sources atmospheric co2 soil co2 and the dissolution of carbonate minerals li et al 2008 li et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 the δ13c values of atmospheric co2 g were approximately 7 and approximately 8 when co2 g dissolved in water soil co2 was derived from the heterotrophic oxidation of soil organic matter or respiration of plant roots and its c isotopic composition was controlled by the relative proportion of c3 over c4 plants and the rate of co2 diffusion yao et al 2007 research has reported that the δ13c poc signatures were approximately 25 in the xijiang river basin southwest china li et al 2008 and the δ13c values of soil co2 were approximately 21 because the fractionation caused by the diffusion of 12co2 g was 4 4 the δ13c values of carbonate minerals were approximately 0 consequently δ13c dic values that resulted from the dissolution of carbonate rock and soil co2 should be 11 2 li et al 2010 because the hco3 was derived in approximately equal proportions from co2 aq δ13c 22 in co2 aq and caco3 δ13c 0 the δ13c dic values in the t0 aquifer were consistent with the results from the dissolution of carbonate rock and soil co2 in addition the significant positive correlation between hco3 and ca2 r2 0 72 fig 6 b also indicated the weathering of carbonate in buried confined aquifers the contributions of atmospheric and soil co2 become quite limited compared with other sources as previously mentioned the mineralization of rich organic matter in a strong reducing environment contributes to the major carbon pool for the confined groundwater in the nsi zone carbonate mineral dissolution with co2 produced by c mineralization was the main hco3 source for the groundwater in the si zone dic sources didn t followed the mixing behavior of seawater and freshwater fig s1 meanwhile the δ13c dic values did not show a typical increasing pattern with salinity conservative mixing of freshwater with more negative δ13c values and marine water with δ13c values close to 0 fig 6a fig s1 which also indicated other carbon sources in the si zone the strong reducing environment and intrusion of seawater suggested the possible existence of methanogenesis and sulfate reduction which produced more hco3 in the confined aquifers the related reaction will be discussed next 5 2 3 sulfur concerning the sulfate concentration and δ34s signals the narrow isotope composition was consistent with the isotopic composition of continental evaporate suggesting that so4 2 originated from the dissolution of continental evaporite in the t0 aquifer mizota and sasaki 1996 for the confined groundwater samples in the nsi zone the sulfate concentration and δ34s and δ18o signals suggested that sulfur was also derived from evaporite dissolution for the confined groundwater samples in the si zone even though seawater intrusion was proven the δ34s and δ18o values in the t1 and b1 aquifers were obviously higher than those in modern seawater 21 for δ34s and 9 5 for δ18o mizota and sasaki 1996 in addition the so4 2 content was remarkably decreased as the fsea increased fig 7 which combined with the negative relationship between δ34s and so4 2 and the significant positive correlation between δ34s and δ18o suggests the existence of a sulfate reduction process in the si zone 5 3 redox processes in coastal groundwater system 5 3 1 redox conditions and forms of c n and s the redox state of groundwater has been shown to be a primary control of element species such as n c and s generally positive eh values indicate an oxidized environment while negative eh values suggest a strongly reduced environment as shown in fig 9 the shallow aquifer t0 showed an oxidized state and the dominant n species were n2 or no3 sulfur and carbon in the t0 aquifer mainly acted as so4 2 hco3 and h2co3 in contrast the confined aquifers t1 and b1 showed a reduced environment n species were dominant as nh4 in the t1 aquifer and as n2 or nh4 in the b1 aquifer sulfur was in the form of so4 2 in most of the confined groundwater samples and hs or h2s in a small portion of the confined groundwater samples the carbon species were co2 or ch2o in most of the confined groundwater and ch4 in parts of the confined aquifer 5 3 2 geochemical evolution under different redox conditions the distinct redox conditions in the unconfined and confined aquifers resulted in the different geochemical evolutions of c n and s in the study area for the unconfined t0 aquifer a low ammonium content coupled with the oxidizing environment suggested that nitrification may be the key factor influencing the transformation of nitrogen however the positive relationship between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 r2 0 66 fig 5c indicated that denitrification was also crucial to nitrogen transformation dic mainly originated from soil co2 and rock weathering and sulfate originated from the dissolution of continental evaporate no obvious correlation between c n and s content and isotopic composition suggested c n s was loosely coupled in this aquifer figs s2 s4 for the confined t1 and b1 aquifers organic matter mineralization under a stronger redox environment has been proven jiao et al 2010 generally the mineralization of organic matter can be divided into three steps first fermentative bacteria hydrolyze the polysaccharides and convert them into alcohols fatty acids and h2 second hydrogen producing acetogenic bacteria degrade the alcohols and fatty acids further to acetic acid formic acid h2 and co2 finally the acetate formate and h2 produced in the first and second stages are oxidized by an electron acceptor appelo and postma 2005 blaser and conrad 2016 the fermentative intermediated acetate formate and h2 consumed by the electron acceptor were the key factors driving the mineralization of organic matter in the t1 and b1 aquifers the lack of do no3 fe iii and mn iv suggested that sulfate and co2 may be the main electron acceptors in the confined groundwater system sulfate reduction was catalyzed by various strains of bacteria according to the overall reaction appelo and postma 2005 4 2 ch 2 o so 4 2 2 hco 3 h 2 s here ch2o was used as a simplified representation of organic matter the occurrence of sulfate reduction in aquifers depends on both the content of organic matter and the supply of sulfate as previously described the important local source of sulfate was seawater intrusion the reaction amounts of so4 2 are shown in table 3 and the so4 2 contents were only depleted in the si zone in most cases gypsum precipitation may be the main reason for the so4 2 decrease in the groundwater system however the saturation indices of gypsum calculated by phreeqc table s1 suggested that no gypsum precipitation occurred and sulfate reduction became the major sink of so4 2 in the si zone in addition the negative correlation between the so4 2 contents and δ34s so4 2 and the positive correlation between δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 fig 8 in the si zone also indicated the occurrence of sulfate reduction the high ch4 contents in the confined aquifers indicate the formation of methane in general the predominant processes of methane formation were the fermentation of acetate eq 5 and the reduction of co2 by free hydrogen eq 6 appelo and postma 2005 5 ch 3 cooh ch 4 co 2 6 co 2 4 h 2 2 h 2 o ch 4 the isotopic fractionation effects of the two processes were significantly different the overall c isotopic fractionation factors ε for acetate fermentation and co2 reduction were 7 35 and 30 90 respectively blaser and conrad 2016 huang and hall 2018 because the mineralization of organic carbon contributed to most of the carbon pool the mass balance of carbon could be used to evaluate the dominant processes in the study area under the assumption that there is congruent dissolution of carbonate half of hco3 originated from dissolved co2 g then the molar ratio of ch4 ch4 1 α co2 which we named the fermentation factor ff can be used to evaluate whether co2 reduction occurs 1 α co2 represent all co2 produced from organic matter mineralization and α 0 represent that co2 mainly originate from acetate fermentation this co2 molar ratio was equal to ch4 molar ratio α 0 represent that 1 1 α percent of co2 derive from acetate fermentation and α 1 α percent of co2 derive from the mixing of the first and second step of organic matter mineralization obviously if ff 0 5 there exist the reduction of co2 as acetate fermentation produced the same amount of co2 and ch4 if ff 0 5 it is hard to judge the existence of co2 reduction it was found that ff varied from 0 00 to 0 77 for the confined groundwater samples in the nsi zone and from 0 00 to 0 96 for the confined groundwater samples in the si zone only two samples in the nsi zone and almost half of the samples in the si zone had ff values higher than 0 5 indicated the occurrence of co2 reduction for the confined groundwater samples with ff lower than 0 5 in the nsi zone we applied a two end member mixing equation to assume that 1 ch4 mainly originates from acetate fermentation eq 5 2 the mass balance equations eq 7 can be used to calculate the c isotopic composition and 3 the organic starting material has δ13c values of 25 δ13c om and no isotopic fractionation occurs during the first and second step of organic matter mineralization 7 δ 13 c om 1 δ 13 c ch 4 0 5 δ 13 c co 2 0 5 if εacetate ch4 is 35 huang and hall 2018 then the δ13c value of ch4 is 60 and the δ13c value of co2 produced becomes 10 1 25 0 5 25 35 0 5 10 accordingly the δ13c values of the co2 pool turn to 25 00 to 4 99 δ13c co2 pool 10 1 1 α 25 α 1 α and the δ13c dic values should be 22 97 to 4 52 δ13c dic δ13c caco3 1 2 h c o 3 1 α c o 2 1 2 h c o 3 δ13c co2 pool 1 α c o 2 1 α c o 2 1 2 h c o 3 clearly the estimated value of δ13c dic was lower than the measured values 15 72 to 5 63 except for samples t1 and b11 suggesting that the co2 reduction was also ubiquitous and that it had a strong isotopic fractionation effect on the δ13c dic values for the confined groundwater samples with ff lower than 0 5 in the si zone it is difficult to evaluate the isotopic fractionation effect of acetate fermentation because sulfate reduction also had a strong influence on δ13c dic values even when sulfate reduction depleted the heavy carbon isotope sample b10 with a low ff value 0 18 also showed an extremely high δ13c dic value 7 12 indicating that co2 reduction also exists in partially confined groundwater samples with low ff values in the si zone 5 4 relationship among n c and s in the reduced coastal aquifer generally sulfate reduction and methanogenesis increase the dic content while heavy carbon isotopes are depleted by sulfate reduction and enriched by methanogenesis the influential degree of methanogenesis and sulfate reduction on δ13c dic values can be observed through the relationship between mso4 react and ch4 groundwater samples can be divided into four classes according to mso4 react and ch4 values fig 10 the groundwater samples in class i showed extremely low ch4 concentrations and mso4 react values obviously the groundwater samples in class i all shallow groundwater samples and the partially confined groundwater samples in the nsi zone were not affected by methanogenesis and sulfate reduction the groundwater samples in class ii located in the nsi zone showed that the ch4 concentration increased without changes in mso4 react values and the mso4 react values were approximately 0 generally the δ13c values increased with increasing ch4 since the δ13c values were greatly affected by methanogenesis however some samples such as b11 with a high ch4 content showed a light c isotope composition δ13c 11 19 while sample b08 with a relatively lower ch4 content showed a heavy c isotope composition δ13c 15 43 this phenomenon can be attributed to the dic content and methanogenesis processes sample b08 showed an extremely low dic content 1 66 mmol l and high ff values 0 77 suggesting that co2 reduction strongly increases the δ13c dic values sample b11 showed a high dic content 7 09 mmol l and moderate ff values 0 46 suggesting that dic is mainly derived from the dissolution of carbonate rock and co2 produced by acetate fermentation the groundwater samples in class iii located in the si zone showed that the mso4 react values decreased with little change in the ch4 concentration and the ch4 content was very low these samples featured enriched 34s so4 2 and 18o so4 2 as well as depleted 13c dic since groundwater was greatly influenced by sulfate reduction the δ13c value decreased as the reactive sulfate content decreased nevertheless the relatively light c isotope composition of b12 10 33 was hard to explain because of its relatively low ch4 content moderate mso4 react values and moderate dic content 2 00 mmol l the groundwater samples in class iv located in the si zone showed that the ch4 concentration increased with decreasing mso4 react these samples featured enriched values of 34s so4 2 and 18o so4 2 and a wide range of δ13c dic since the groundwater was affected by both methanogenesis and sulfate reduction the δ13c value mainly depended on the ch4 content mso4 react and source proportion of dic in general the higher the δ13c value was the stronger the impact of methanogenesis as mentioned the release of ammonium resulted from organic matter mineralization in the confined aquifers in the study region co2 acted as the main electron acceptor in class ii sulfate acted as the main electron acceptor in class iii and sulfate or both sulfate and co2 acted as the electron acceptors in class iv accordingly acetate fermentation and co2 reduction became the key factors driving ammonium release for the groundwater samples in class ii in the nsi zone sulfur reduction became the key factor driving ammonium release for the groundwater samples in class iii in the si zone acetate fermentation sulfur reduction and co2 reduction worked together to promote ammonium release for the groundwater samples in class iv in the si zone as shown in fig 11 the ammonium content in the t1 aquifer has a significant negative relationship with mso42 react r2 0 83 and a positive relationship with the ch4 content r2 0 46 this indicates that sulfur reduction and methane formation had a closed link for the release of ammonium in the study region although the marine source of so4 2 had a significant influence on the release of nitrogen and the transformation of carbon the sulfate content has been consumed completely in most of the confined aquifers tables 1 and 3 and co2 reduction may become the key factor in organic matter mineralization and ammonium release in the confined aquifer in the future 6 conclusion the features of carbon sulfur and nitrogen and the controlling processes in the coastal groundwater system in the south part of pearl river delta were studied and the following conclusions were drawn for the oxidizing unconfined aquifer ammonium and nitrate originated from manure and sewage dic was mainly derived from soil co2 and weathering of carbonate rocks and sulfate originated from the dissolution of continental evaporate nitrification and denitrification were the key factors influencing the transformation of nitrogen and c n s was loosely coupled in the unconfined aquifer for the groundwater samples in reducing confined aquifers without seawater intrusion ammonium was derived from the mineralization of organic matter sulfate mainly originated from rock weathering and dic mainly originated from carbonate mineral dissolution and the co2 produced by organic matter mineralization acetate fermentation and co2 reduction were ubiquitous in this region accordingly acetate fermentation and co2 reduction became the key factors driving ammonium release in the nsi zone for the groundwater samples in reducing confined aquifer with seawater intrusion ammonium was derived from the mineralization of organic matter sulfate was derived from the mixing of fresh water and seawater and dic was derived from carbonate mineral dissolution seawater and the co2 produced by organic matter mineralization c n s was highly coupled in si zone because both bsr and methanogenesis can increase the dic content while bsr enriches lighter carbon isotopes and methanogenesis enriches heavier carbon isotopes thus a wide range of δ13c dic values was found in si zone sulfate or both sulfate and co2 were the electron acceptors in the si zone accordingly acetate fermentation sulfur reduction and co2 reduction worked together to promote ammonium release for the groundwater samples in the si zone however the exhaustion of sulfate in si zone will make co2 reduction the key factor for organic matter mineralization in the future acknowledgments this study was supported financially by the general program of the national natural science foundation of china grant no 41877470 the natural science

6394,the intensification of the hydrologic cycle due to climate change is likely to influence the extreme precipitation characteristics i e intensity duration and frequency these precipitation characteristics are integrated to construct intensity duration frequency idf curves that are widely used to design civil infrastructure systems these idf curves are typically derived based on the stationary assumption however the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events likely to become nonstationary as a consequence of climate change during the past decades unusual extreme precipitation events with more than thousand year return periods were recorded in the united states this study investigates the nonstationary nature of the most recent extreme precipitation events occurred over different durations 1 3 and 5 days by incorporating time varying covariates such as time maximum temperature mean temperature and the el niño southern oscillation cycle enso the nonstationary frequency analysis for these extreme events was conducted using nonstationary generalized extreme value distribution by incorporating the time varying covariates it was observed that most of the temporal evolution of extreme precipitation events follow the nonstationary pattern which may be due to the increase in the magnitude of recent extreme precipitation events especially during hurricane events different combination of covariates can potentially influence the nonstationary frequency analysis and the type of covariate may differ when the accumulated period of extreme precipitation event increased based on the nonstationary extreme value analysis the return periods associated with extreme precipitation events significantly reduced compared to the stationary approach keywords nonstationary frequency analysis extreme precipitation idf curves 1 introduction the design of major infrastructures such as urban and highway drainage flood barriers hydraulic structures sewerage systems and dam spillways relies on magnitude and frequency of heavy precipitation events mishra and singh 2010 as a consequence it is important to understand the spatial and seasonal distribution of extreme precipitation events however the spatiotemporal distribution of extreme precipitations vary between regions in terms of their magnitude intensity and temporal distribution within a given time frame konapala et al 2017 mishra et al 2009 donat et al 2016 over the past six decades there is a robust increase in the extreme daily precipitation averaged over both dry and wet regimes based on both observations and climate models donat et al 2016 the existing infrastructures are often designed using intensity duration frequency idf curves based on the stationary assumption which suggests that the behavior e g statistical characteristics of the natural hydrologic system does not change over a period of time however many studies suggested an increase in non stationary nature of climate patterns milly et al 2008 katz 2009 2013 villarini et al 2009 son et al 2017 sarhadi and soulis 2017 risser and wehner 2017 due to the change in climate patterns the stationary assumption of idf curves might underestimate the extreme events recently several studies indicated that the design storm estimated based on stationary models are lower compared to the nonstationary models cheng and aghakhouchak 2014 mondal and mujumdar 2015 wi et al 2016 sarhadi and soulis 2017 emanuel 2017 agilan and umamahesh 2017 pfahl et al 2017 over time the divergence between stationary and nonstationary flood frequency magnitudes increases under climate change scenarios condon et al 2015 global warming heats up the atmosphere leading to the increase in evaporation and expansion of atmospheric water vapor content that further results in the intensification in the spatiotemporal distribution of extreme precipitation events neelin et al 2017 o gorman and schneider 2009 mishra and singh 2010 for each one degree celcius increment in temperature the extreme precipitation is observed to increase by about 7 as formulated by clausius clapeyron equation westra et al 2014 ivancic and shaw 2016 in general climate models suggest an intensification of extreme precipitation events during the 21st century pfahl et al 2017 although they vary in space and time extreme precipitation events can cause severe flooding property damage potential loss of life especially for urban areas with high population density mishra and singh 2010 recently there has been an increase in a number of studies on extreme precipitation events in the united states huang et al 2018 luong et al 2017 leng et al 2016 bracken et al 2015 the trends in extreme precipitation 2 per decade in the top 1 of observed events are higher than mean precipitation 0 6 per decade kunkel et al 2013 2008 reveals a significant shift in the tails of the distribution previous studies provided strong evidence that there is an upward trend in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation over the us kunkel et al 2013 the nonstationary frequency analysis depends on appropriate covariates for example based on only time varying component sarhadi and soulis 2017 son et al 2017 human induced changes based on the co2 concentration risser and wehner 2017 global warming in the form of global gridded temperature mondal and mujumdar 2015 urbanization based on the changes in the land use with respect to time agilan and umamahesh 2017 and large scale climate covariates such as el niño southern oscillation enso north atlantic oscillation nao vasiliades et al 2015 for example the human induced changes e g co2 concentration and global warming plays a significant role by increasing the chances of maximum 7 day accumulated precipitation during hurricane harvey by a factor of at least 3 5 risser and wehner 2017 these covariates have a potential influence on nonstationary behavior of climate variables e g extreme precipitation therefore identification of important covariates for the nonstationary frequency analysis is an important step 1 1 recent extreme precipitation events in the us during the past three decades 1980 2018 overall 241 weather and climate related disasters impacted the usa where each disaster resulted in economic losses exceeding 1 billion noaa 2019 fig 1 while drought and wildfire dry events are a very typical phenomenon for western contiguous united states us with one event per year the number of wet events categorized as a severe storm tropical cyclone flood has dramatically increased since 2005 these numbers highlight the recent increasing trends of the occurrences of wet catastrophic events especially for severe storm events statistically the annual economic losses due to the billion dollar weather disasters for the us have increased significantly about 5 per year smith and katz 2013 in which the wet events have a significant contribution the extreme precipitations events are often associated with hurricanes and tropical storms in the us for example huang et al 2018 indicated that the main reason for the abrupt increase in extreme precipitation over the northeastern united states is due to the occurrence of the hurricane and tropical storms and these are typically fueled by the warmer atlantic ocean temperature that heats up the atmospheric water vapor hurricanes often lead to extreme precipitation events that can cause significant damage to the us economy for example two major hurricanes occurred in the same year 2017 are a the hurricane harvey which devastated houston texas august 26th 28th followed by b hurricane irma september 9th 11th that caused significant damage to florida these two hurricanes resulted in a total economic loss for the united states in an excess of 125 billion aon 2018 the natural disasters such as the hurricanes harvey and irma highlighted the need for quantitative estimation of the risk of such disasters emanuel 2017 in our study we identified six extreme precipitation events occurred in the usa during the period of 2011 2017 and these extreme events are displayed in fig 2 by prism precipitation data daly et al 1994 the accumulated 3 day precipitation due to hurricane harvey over houston texas was about 800 mm fig 2a and the 500 mm of precipitation is equivalent to a return period of 2000 years for the same location emanuel 2017 hurricane harvey the eighth named storm of the 2017 atlantic hurricane season was recognized as the wettest tropical cyclone ever recorded to hit the usa ellenrieder 2018 leading to the unprecedented amount of precipitation and massive inland flooding in the greater houston area risser and wehner 2017 hurricane irma a category 5 storm editorial 2017 considered to be the most powerful storm ever recorded in the atlantic hurricane brought massive precipitation accompanied by strong wind gusts and storm surge the maximum precipitation occurred during hurricane irma at fort pierce fl was about 400 mm with the maximum wind gust of 230 km h prior to irma the magnitude of extreme precipitation from a no name storm in louisiana aug 2016 was recognized as the 1000 year event which resulted in three times as much precipitation as hurricane katrina samenow 2016 nws 2016 this extreme precipitation in lousiana resulted in flash flooding river flooding and backwater flooding over a period of time the lousiana official reported that over 30 000 people rescued and at least 60 600 homes had been impacted and this event reported to have killed at least 13 people van der wiel et al 2017 another thousand year precipitation event occurred near the coast of south carolina in oct 2015 mizzell et al 2016 marciano and lackmann 2017 that resulted in 430 mm of precipitation over four consecutive days this extreme precipitation event caused higher flood damage due to unusually high tides due to the recent perigean spring tide and saturated soil moisture due to the heavy precipitation in late september crn 2016 the maximum daily precipitation sep 2013 of magnitude 230 mm recorded at boulder colorado led to front range flood yochum and moore 2013 which is considered to be one of the most extreme major flood disasters the annual exceedance probability for this extreme precipitation event was as low as 1 1000 gochis et al 2015 nws 2013 several states in the northeastern united states witnessed severe flooding due to hurricane irene and the remnants of tropical storm lee in late august early september 2011 that resulted in total damage of 7 billion and approximately 45 deaths suro et al 2011 among the six recent extreme event locations boulder is located in the continental subarctic climate region and the remaining five locations are located in the mediterranean climate region degu et al 2011 these most recent catastrophic events occurred in a different part of the us at different times resulted in the major socio economic loss the overall goal of this study is to i identify the best covariates between time daily maximum temperature annual average temperature and enso that has potential influence on the most recent extreme precipitation events in the united states ii to derive the updated return levels and return periods of these extreme precipitation events in the context of nonstationary frequency analysis and iii to evaluate the perspective of nonstationary information on the return periods in order to highlight the necessity of the revised idf curves for infrastructure designs 2 data and choices of covariates 2 1 extreme values of precipitation data the daily precipitation and maximum minimum temperature for the six selected locations were obtained from the global historical climatology network ghcn ftp ftp ncdc noaa gov pub data ghcn daily table 1 these locations recently witnessed extreme precipitation events discussed in section 1 1 and the data sets are available for longer time periods with less than 1 missing value additional information on these selected stations are provided in table 1 and their locations are shown in fig 2 mean daily temperature value is averaged based on the maximum and minimum temperature recorded for the same day in general three different methods are commonly used to identify extreme precipitation events mishra and singh 2010 and they are classified based on their amount specific thresholds and annual maxima values in this study extreme precipitation events are calculated based on the annual maximum 24 h precipitation time series the 1 3 5 consecutive days of annual maximum precipitation amr time series are derived and they are denoted by 1 day 3 day and 5 day amr the 3 day amr time series for all six selected stations and the date of occurrence of the most recent extreme events are presented in fig 3 overall it was observed that the magnitude of recent extreme events is comparatively much higher than previous events 2 2 choices of covariates for non stationary analysis in this section we provide an overview of the selected covariates and their potential influence on extreme events the temperature can be considered as an important covariate because the warmer atmosphere is likely to hold more moisture thereby generating a favorable condition for an increase in precipitation romero et al 2011 in addition to that based on the clausius claperon relationship a stronger relationship between daily maximum temperature and extreme precipitation events was observed compared to average temperature herath et al 2018 clausius clapeyron relationship also reveals the increase in saturated specific humidity in the warmer air by 6 7 per degree kelvin of local warming in the absence of any dynamical change risser and wehner 2017 therefore the maximum daily temperature can be considered as an important covariate in the nonstationary analysis of extreme precipitation in addition to that changes in local temperature can have a significant correlation with extreme precipitation intensity and frequency compared to the global process mondal and mujumdar 2015 agilan and umamahesh 2017 highlighted the strong correlation between change in local temperature and sub hourly duration extreme precipitation events for a station in india in our study we considered the local annual average temperature as an additional covariate to study their influence on extreme precipitation events several studies sarhadi and soulis 2017 son et al 2017 included time covariate in the non stationary analysis and therefore it is included as an additional covariate to study the nonstationary process for the recent extreme precipitation events in the united states large scale climate indices e g enso likely to influence local weather conditions enso el niño southern oscillation is a coupled ocean atmosphere phenomenon associated with the fluctuations in the sea surface temperature located in the tropical pacific the extreme phases of enso has a potential influence on precipitation anomalies in many geographic locations around the world mason and goddard 2001 and especially it has significant influence on extreme precipitation events over the contiguous united states yu et al 2017 deflorio et al 2013 schubert et al 2008 gershunov and barnett 1998 mishra and singh 2010 there are several indices used to represent the phase and strength of enso events hanley et al 2003 typically the commonly used indices are the regional sea surface temperature stt in the equatorial pacific niño 1 2 niño 3 niño 4 niño 3 4 niño 3 4 is a widely used index of enso activity and it is calculated by averaging the kaplan extended sst anomalies kaplan et al 1998 in the region comprising 5s 5 n and 170 w 120 w previously niño 3 4 was used as a covariate for modeling nonstationary precipitation agilan and umamahesh 2017 son et al 2017 mondal and mujumdar 2015 risser and wehner 2017 in this study we selected niño 3 4 based on extended reconstructed sst ersst data set averaged over the november to march as an additional covariate to represent the large scale climate phenomenon for nonstationary analysis of extreme precipitation events 3 methodology 3 1 nonstationary extreme value analysis it is often useful to study the extreme precipitation events based on longer durations e g few days due to the lag time associated between excessive precipitation and hydrologic flooding mishra and singh 2010 therefore the extreme precipitation values in the present study were derived based on maximum annual precipitation amounts at different time scales 1 3 and 5 days the distributions of extreme values fisher and tippett 1928 include three families gumbel fréchet and weibull all three families are combined into the generalized extreme values distribution gev jenkinson 1955 the gev was used to derive both stationary and nonstationary models the cumulative distribution function cdf of the gev family has the functional form jenkinson 1955 1 g z exp 1 ξ z μ σ 1 ξ where μ σ ξ are the location scale and shape parameter respectively according to fisher and tippett 1928 for ξ 0 the distribution is called gumbel ξ 0 refers to fréchet and the ξ 0 is corresponding to weibull distribution coles 2001 several methods are developed to estimate the gev model parameters such as maximum likelihood estimation mle smith 1985 probability weighted moment hosking et al 1985 l moments hosking 1990 method of moments madsen et al 1997 and generalized maximum likelihood estimators adlouni et al 2007 in our study we utilized the mle method to estimate the gev parameters for nonstationary analysis and the similar method was applied in previous studies agilan and umamahesh 2017 risser and wehner 2017 mondal and mujumdar 2015 the conventional spatial bootstrap technique was applied for the significance test to determine the uncertainty bounds and also to estimate the return levels and the return periods 3 2 models and covariates in the nonstationary analysis the parameters are expressed as a function of covariates as discussed earlier section 2 2 four covariates were selected for nonstationary analysis of extreme precipitation which includes i annual average daily temperature tm c ii the max daily temperature tx c recorded at the time the extreme events occurred iii the seasonal average ersst over niño 3 4 region for the djfm months to represent the influence of natural phenomenon e and iv time in year y different combinations of covariates are provided in table 2 the time varying gev distribution was applied by varying the location and scale parameters as a function of selected covariates however the shape parameter is kept constant as it may be unrealistic to assume shape parameter as a smooth function of time coles 2001 and it is advisable to use the constant shape for a small number of stations cooley et al 2007 similar assumption has been made in recent studies sarhadi and soulis 2017 risser and wehner 2017 agilan and umamahesh 2017 for each of the couple station duration there are 21 models are derived which includes 1 stationary and 20 nonstationary models based on four covariates and two time varying parameters overall 18 best models were identified based on 378 models that were constructed based on a combination of 6 stations three types of extreme events durations and four types of covariates a brief description of the model formulation is discussed here and detailed information is provided in table 2 three model types are briefly discussed below model type 1 stationary model s0 three gev parameters are kept constant over time 2 μ t μ σ t σ ξ t ξ model type 2 a nonstationary model with varying location parameter

their associated covariates tm daily average temperature tx daily max temperature e enso and y time domain 3 3 identification of the best models the akaike information criterion aic was applied to identify the best model among 21 models table 2 for each station as well as different duration of extreme events the model that has minimum aic is selected as the best fit model makridakis et al 2003 the mathematical equation for aic is formulated as akaike 1974 5 aic 2 log l 2 m where m is the number of terms estimated in the model l is the likelihood function of the models with a monotonically decreasing function of the sum of squared residuals the aic penalizes the minimized negative log likelihood for the number of parameters estimated katz 2013 mishra and desai 2005 aic is commonly used to select the best model and it has been used for nonstationary analysis risser and wehner 2017 agilan and umamahesh 2017 mondal and mujumdar 2015 the aic values were computed for all the selected 21 models based on the 1 3 5 day annual maximum precipitation at six stations the selected best model is then compared with stationary model s0 using the likelihood ratio test lr with 95 confidence intervals coles 2001 if the test is insignificant then the stationary model s0 is considered as the best model the best models based on the different types of extreme precipitation events at six locations are provided in table 3 3 4 estimation of the nonstationary return period the nonstationary frequency analysis models were developed based on past observations by excluding the recent extreme event for example the historical amr data was considered up to 2016 for model development for fort pierce station hurricane irma in 2017 once the nonstationary models are identified the return period for extreme events e g hurricane irma in 2017 are computed based on the model parameters based on the sets of the corresponding covariates tx tm e y of the current year once the best nonstationary model was identified the corresponding return period for the recent extreme events was computed and compared with the corresponding return period from stationary gev fitting the formulation for the return period based on the stationary nonstationary model is given by the equation 6 rp 1 1 exp 1 ξ z μ t σ t 1 ξ where z is the corresponding amr value of the extreme event and μ t σ t ξ are the location scale and shape parameters for corresponding nonstationary stationary models specified in equations 2 3 and 4 the estimated model parameters and standard errors associated with the best models table 3 are provided in table 4 the revised return periods for the most recent extreme precipitation events are provided in table 5 finally the change in the return periods for the selected extreme events between nonstationary and stationary can be computed as in equation 7 7 reduction nrp s r p nrp 100 where nrp and srp represent the return periods based on the nonstationary and stationary approach 4 results 4 1 nonstationary analysis and best covariates for selected models the best models for the six selected stations are provided in table 3 and their corresponding gev parameters are tabulated in table 4 overall 18 best models from 378 models are identified for three temporal precipitation durations at six locations out of these 18 best models only 2 models follow stationary gev s0 and 16 models follow nonstationary processes the nonstationary models vary based on their location and scale parameters due to the different potential influence of covariates the nonstationary models performed well based on all the amr time series for the selected station located in houston texas it was observed that clausius claperon relationship holds true for this location where a strong relationship was observed between maximum daily temperature and extreme precipitation both the covariates max daily temperature and time have a potential influence on the nonstationary nature ns5 and ns16 of the 1 and 3 day amr time series it also implies that the change in temperature during the post climatic period 1965 mishra and singh 2010 has a potential influence on amr in a recent study risser and wehner 2017 highlighted that global warming is likely to increase the chances of the largest 7 day precipitation total by a factor of at least 3 5 for most of the affected areas in houston based on the similar analysis over fort pierce station fl the average local temperature tm and daily maximum temperature tx are the most influencing covariates for nonstationary extreme precipitation analysis for the longer duration 3 and 5 days amr time series the nonstationary analysis for the charleston station reveals that the 1 day amr follows stationary processes s0 however at longer duration both 3 and 5 day amr performed well by nonstationary models ns1 based on time varying location parameters it implies that the stationary idf curve best describes the 1 day amr in charleston while for the 3 day and 5 day accumulated events the nonstationary processes with time varying location parameters are the best models to demonstrate the extreme precipitation behavior in fact the 5 days october 1 5 2015 accumulated precipitation led to a historic flooding event and flash flooding was prevalent that led to significant damage to civil infrastructure systems and many people having to be rescued by emergency personnel table 3 clearly demonstrates the potential influence of covariates on the nonstationary nature of extreme precipitation events in baton rouge lousiana the best model identified for 1 day amr is different from 3 and 5 day amr in this case 3 and 5 day amr follows similar nonstationary models based on varying location and scale parameters whereas time and enso found to be important covariates for 1 day amr in a recent study van der wiel et al 2017 highlighted that the return period of 3 day amr event in louisiana 2016 is about 550 years with 95 confidence interval and the intensity of extreme precipitation events of this return time have increased since 1900 further the authors suggested that the regional probability of 3 day extreme precipitation increases by more than a factor of 1 4 due to anthropogenic climate change our results point towards the potential influence of enso on extreme precipitation and van der wiel et al 2017 highlighted that the evidence for a relation to el niño half a year earlier can be possible with some analyses showing a positive connection and others none similarly nonstationary models performed well for the other two stations located in bay boro station north carolina and boulder colorado in the case of boulder station all the covariates contribute to the 1 day amr however 5 day amr at bay boro station followed a stationary model in addition to that the best models for 1 and 3 day amr at bay boro station includes enso as potential covariates overall most 16 out of 18 of the stations as well as the duration of extreme precipitation followed a nonstationary pattern there are six best models follow the time based covariates for location and scale parameters that represent 30 of the total number of models baton rouge and charleston are most likely time based nonstationary models for higher durations 3 and 5 day extreme precipitation about six models 30 exhibit the significant relationship between combined covariates with extreme precipitation for shorter 1 and 3 day duration in general for most of the locations the frequency analysis of 5 day amr show a significant relationship with only one covariate and the choice of covariate varies for a different location the gev parameters estimated from different best models and their corresponding standard errors are provided in table 4 4 2 revised return levels based on the nonstationary approach the nonstationary frequency analysis was performed based on the available data prior to the occurrence of the recent extreme events the corresponding return levels periods were computed based on the gev parameters table 4 obtained from the nonstationary analysis of the best models the nonstationary return levels based on 50 100 and 500 year return period using 3 day amr data sets for the best models are provided in fig 4 it can be observed that the nonstationary return levels vary with time in contrast to the stationary return level the time varying covariate in location parameter model ns1 charleston fig 4d indicates return levels with a linear pattern having a mild slope along the time domain in the case of time varying location and scale varying parameters ns12 model fig 4c the corresponding return level witness a moderate slope based on the linear return levels the steep slopes associated with return levels fig 4c indicates the reduction in return period with respect to recent time periods in other word the large magnitude of storms is becoming more common in recent times risser and wehner 2017 the return level patterns likely to be influenced by the type of covariates the oscillating pattern of non stationary return levels depends on the choice of covariates for example the return levels with enso as a covariate ns3 fig 4f fluctuates with the variation of sst unlike the linear increasing trend observed based on the time covariate a similar observation was made based on the time and enso covariates model ns6 for boulder station fig 4e it was observed that the return levels associated with enso covariate may not follow a significant increasing or decreasing trend the best model for fort pierce station ns17 fig 4b incorporates time and mean temperature as covariates that result in significant increasing trends for all the return periods it is slightly different from fig 4c where only time covariate was considered the oscillation of the return level is due to the effect of mean temperature covariates it is worth to highlight that the 3 day maximum amr extreme event precipitation 570 mm recorded during hurricane irma at fort pierce fig 4b represents 500 year return period based on the nonstationary analysis however this return period is comparatively higher based on the stationary analysis the recorded 3 day amr event from hurricane harvey fig 4a is higher than 500 year return period based on the nonstationary process ns16 model that includes time and maximum temperature as covariates along with location and scale parameters overall it was observed that the temporal pattern of return levels varies with the covariates some of the covariates may lead to a linearly increasing trend e g time and land use change due to urbanization in nonstationary return level whereas some of the covariates e g maximum daily temperature and enso likely to oscillate with no clear pattern of increasing decreasing trend may induce similar behavior with return levels as well however the combination of time and other covariates for example enso ns6 and mean temperature ns17 may result in an increase in the return level trend fig 4c and 3f respectively the return level and return period are estimated for each studied station for 1 day 3 day and 5 day amr fig 5 demonstrates the nonstationary return level for 3 day amr time series based on 500 year return period along with its uncertainty the continuous red line represents the return level based on a 500 year return period and the green and blue bands exhibit the 60 and 95 confidence intervals respectively and they are computed using the bootstrapping technique the 95 confidence interval compared to 60 indicates a steady increasing trend for fort pierce baton rouge and charleston fig 5b c d 4 3 intensity duration frequency curve from nonstationary analysis fig 6 compares the stationary and nonstationary intensity duration frequency idf curves derived based on the best model parameters table 4 the recent extreme precipitation events were compared against idf curves as shown in fig 6 the nonstationary idf curves were derived based on the best models that include time covariate fig 6c d maximum daily temperature and enso fig 6a time and enso fig 6e time and mean temperature fig 6b and enso only fig 6f it was observed that the nonstationary curves red lines are always higher than a stationary one black lines which suggests that the nonstationary models represent a reduced return period compared to the stationary ones revised return periods for different temporal resolutions based on the stationary and nonstationary frequency analysis are provided in table 5 it was observed that the magnitude of return periods of extreme event reduced significantly from stationary to the nonstationary case for example the amount of aggregated precipitation based on 3 and 5 days precipitation due to hurricane harvey houston station represents a return period of approximate 6700 and 5000 years respectively based on the stationary assumption these extremely high return periods are also highlighted in the literature by risser and wehner 2017 and emanuel 2017 however based on the nonstationary analysis the return period for these extreme events reduced to 4800 and 3900 years reduced by 30 and 25 respectively in the case of hurricane irma fort pierce fl the return periods based on the stationary assumption for 3 day amr and 5 day amr are close to 6300 and 5370 years respectively these numbers reduce to 800 and 3500 years 87 and 35 based on the nonstationary analysis it is important to highlight that the 5000 year return period of extreme precipitation does not correspond to the 5000 year return period of the flood event gochis et al 2015 similarly the return periods for other stations charleston boulder and bayboro are also greater than thousand years based on the 3 day amr table 5 the extreme precipitation events at different time scales witness a reduction in the return period based on the nonstationary gev analysis the percentage reduction in the return periods for all selected extreme events computed from nonstationary and stationary models as formulated in equation 7 shown in fig 7 all the nonstationary models exhibit a reduction in the return period compared to the stationary model that ranges from the lowest rate of 17 to the highest rate of 87 the study clearly highlights that the occurrence of similar extreme precipitation events likely to be more frequent when the return periods are reduced based on the nonstationary analysis for example the return period of 3 day extreme events at barton rogue reduced from 177 to 60 years based on the nonstationary analysis this does not mean that the two extreme events will not occur in a short period of time for example two severe most hurricanes harvey and irma occurred in a month in 2017 it is important to highlight that the percentage change between stationary and nonstationary return periods is not consistent among temporal resolutions i e 1 3 5 days and they vary at different locations however some of the prominent changes were observed for coastal locations with respect to recent extreme events for example baton rouge 66 and 68 based on the 3 and 5 days events fort pierce 87 based on the 3 day extreme events and bay boro 64 based on the 1 day extreme events 5 discussion and conclusion one of the key information required to design major civil infrastructure systems includes intensity duration and frequency of heavy precipitation events these precipitation characteristics are combined to construct intensity duration frequency idf curves which are typically derived based on the stationary assumption the idf curves are widely used for designing civil infrastructure systems for example designing of hydraulic structures against the impact of extreme events e g extreme precipitation floods the models used to derive return periods i e frequency analysis are generally developed based on the assumption that hydrological events e g annual maximum rainfall and flood discharges arise from a stationary hydrological regime however it has been reported in the literature that the hydrological cycle has been changing leading to significant changes in the spatio temporal distribution of occurrences of extreme events thus there is a need to revisit idf curves as well as to develop new methods where there is sufficient evidence of nonstationarity in addition the selection of return periods depend on additional variables such as cost of damages vulnerability and climate risk that needs to be incorporated to develop economic risk based decision approach this is specifically important for countries frequently affected by the severe storm events for example in singapore the idf curves are typically updated once per decade singapore pub 2012 to cope up with the changing climate condition in order to improve the resilience of infrastructure systems the nonstationary idf curves can be explored during the design phase of the infrastructure in order to evaluate the cost and benefit with respect to stationary idf curves especially when these curves are not updated recently in this study we performed the nonstationary frequency analysis of the most recent historical precipitation events occurred between 2011 and 2017 over the united states overall six extreme precipitation events are selected and their corresponding amr time series are constructed based on annual maximum 1 3 and 5 days aggregated values the return period of extreme precipitation events are likely to be influenced by the occurrence of the extreme events within a short period of time for example two thousand year return period precipitation extreme events occurred hurricane harvey and irma in 2017 the following conclusions can be drawn from this study a while the stationary frequency analysis is commonly used for civil infrastructure design recently multiple studies highlighted the increase in the nonstationary pattern of extreme events in this study we performed stationary nonstationary frequency based on six extreme precipitation events during the period 2011 2017 overall 378 stationary nonstationary models were evaluated for three types 1 3 5 day amr of extreme precipitation events at six locations and 18 best models were identified it was observed that most approx 90 of the extreme precipitation events follow the nonstationary pattern over the selected time period this may be due to the increase in the magnitude of recent extreme precipitation events especially during hurricane events b the selection of physical covariates is an important step for nonstationary frequency analysis overall four distinct covariates are identified for nonstationary frequency analysis which includes large scale climate index enso time covariate local annual average temperature and maximum daily temperature during the occurrence of the events different combination of covariates can potentially influence the nonstationary frequency analysis therefore sensitivity test is an important step to identify best covariates different combination of covariates is evaluated for a different type of extreme precipitation patterns at six locations witnessing different climate patterns it was observed that there is not a single covariate that is most sensitive to the nonstationary frequency analysis in all of the cases in fact the combination of several covariates can perform better than using a single covariate for example 1 day amr time series followed a stationary pattern and time varying covariate for 3 day and 5 day amr time series all other stations durations have a different combination of covariates c the temporal pattern of nonstationary return level depends on the extreme value distribution parameters e g location and scale parameters and the choice of covariates for example based on the time covariate e g ns1 and ns12 model a linearly increasing trend may be expected for nonstationary return level whereas the return levels based on enso and temperature likely to oscillate over time compared to time covariate this is due to the temporal variation of the sea surface temperature and change in local temperature over a period of time therefore more studies are necessary to quantify the potential physical mechanism between extreme events and corresponding influencing variables d using the best nonstationary models the intensity duration frequency curves were constructed based on the combination of 6 stations and 3 durations for comparison with stationary idf curves based on the nonstationary extreme value analysis the return periods associated with extreme precipitation events significantly reduced compared to the stationary approach although six representative extreme events at 3 different temporal resolutions 1 3 and 5 day consecutive are selected in this analysis an additional number of events can be investigated in the future research by incorporating more number of precipitation stations to quantify the heterogeneous nature of events within a spatial domain in the process of choosing more number of stations for a particular event may lead to a different set of model parameters and covariates and such analysis is required to investigate the extreme events at a regional scale e the extreme precipitations events are often associated with hurricanes and tropical storms in the us therefore in addition to annual maxima approach discussed in this study additional extreme value distribution such as generalized pareto can be applied to peak over threshold pot data set to capture various extreme precipitation events that occurred within the year further the return periods based on the nonstationary model can be influenced by data length parameter estimation techniques as well as the type of the covariates therefore in depth analysis is further required to minimize the uncertainty associated with such influencing variables declaration of competing interest we have no conflict of interest to report acknowledgement we very much appreciate the editor and reviewer s critical and valuable comment that helped us to improve the manuscript this study was supported by the united states national science foundation nsf award 1855374 
6394,the intensification of the hydrologic cycle due to climate change is likely to influence the extreme precipitation characteristics i e intensity duration and frequency these precipitation characteristics are integrated to construct intensity duration frequency idf curves that are widely used to design civil infrastructure systems these idf curves are typically derived based on the stationary assumption however the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events likely to become nonstationary as a consequence of climate change during the past decades unusual extreme precipitation events with more than thousand year return periods were recorded in the united states this study investigates the nonstationary nature of the most recent extreme precipitation events occurred over different durations 1 3 and 5 days by incorporating time varying covariates such as time maximum temperature mean temperature and the el niño southern oscillation cycle enso the nonstationary frequency analysis for these extreme events was conducted using nonstationary generalized extreme value distribution by incorporating the time varying covariates it was observed that most of the temporal evolution of extreme precipitation events follow the nonstationary pattern which may be due to the increase in the magnitude of recent extreme precipitation events especially during hurricane events different combination of covariates can potentially influence the nonstationary frequency analysis and the type of covariate may differ when the accumulated period of extreme precipitation event increased based on the nonstationary extreme value analysis the return periods associated with extreme precipitation events significantly reduced compared to the stationary approach keywords nonstationary frequency analysis extreme precipitation idf curves 1 introduction the design of major infrastructures such as urban and highway drainage flood barriers hydraulic structures sewerage systems and dam spillways relies on magnitude and frequency of heavy precipitation events mishra and singh 2010 as a consequence it is important to understand the spatial and seasonal distribution of extreme precipitation events however the spatiotemporal distribution of extreme precipitations vary between regions in terms of their magnitude intensity and temporal distribution within a given time frame konapala et al 2017 mishra et al 2009 donat et al 2016 over the past six decades there is a robust increase in the extreme daily precipitation averaged over both dry and wet regimes based on both observations and climate models donat et al 2016 the existing infrastructures are often designed using intensity duration frequency idf curves based on the stationary assumption which suggests that the behavior e g statistical characteristics of the natural hydrologic system does not change over a period of time however many studies suggested an increase in non stationary nature of climate patterns milly et al 2008 katz 2009 2013 villarini et al 2009 son et al 2017 sarhadi and soulis 2017 risser and wehner 2017 due to the change in climate patterns the stationary assumption of idf curves might underestimate the extreme events recently several studies indicated that the design storm estimated based on stationary models are lower compared to the nonstationary models cheng and aghakhouchak 2014 mondal and mujumdar 2015 wi et al 2016 sarhadi and soulis 2017 emanuel 2017 agilan and umamahesh 2017 pfahl et al 2017 over time the divergence between stationary and nonstationary flood frequency magnitudes increases under climate change scenarios condon et al 2015 global warming heats up the atmosphere leading to the increase in evaporation and expansion of atmospheric water vapor content that further results in the intensification in the spatiotemporal distribution of extreme precipitation events neelin et al 2017 o gorman and schneider 2009 mishra and singh 2010 for each one degree celcius increment in temperature the extreme precipitation is observed to increase by about 7 as formulated by clausius clapeyron equation westra et al 2014 ivancic and shaw 2016 in general climate models suggest an intensification of extreme precipitation events during the 21st century pfahl et al 2017 although they vary in space and time extreme precipitation events can cause severe flooding property damage potential loss of life especially for urban areas with high population density mishra and singh 2010 recently there has been an increase in a number of studies on extreme precipitation events in the united states huang et al 2018 luong et al 2017 leng et al 2016 bracken et al 2015 the trends in extreme precipitation 2 per decade in the top 1 of observed events are higher than mean precipitation 0 6 per decade kunkel et al 2013 2008 reveals a significant shift in the tails of the distribution previous studies provided strong evidence that there is an upward trend in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation over the us kunkel et al 2013 the nonstationary frequency analysis depends on appropriate covariates for example based on only time varying component sarhadi and soulis 2017 son et al 2017 human induced changes based on the co2 concentration risser and wehner 2017 global warming in the form of global gridded temperature mondal and mujumdar 2015 urbanization based on the changes in the land use with respect to time agilan and umamahesh 2017 and large scale climate covariates such as el niño southern oscillation enso north atlantic oscillation nao vasiliades et al 2015 for example the human induced changes e g co2 concentration and global warming plays a significant role by increasing the chances of maximum 7 day accumulated precipitation during hurricane harvey by a factor of at least 3 5 risser and wehner 2017 these covariates have a potential influence on nonstationary behavior of climate variables e g extreme precipitation therefore identification of important covariates for the nonstationary frequency analysis is an important step 1 1 recent extreme precipitation events in the us during the past three decades 1980 2018 overall 241 weather and climate related disasters impacted the usa where each disaster resulted in economic losses exceeding 1 billion noaa 2019 fig 1 while drought and wildfire dry events are a very typical phenomenon for western contiguous united states us with one event per year the number of wet events categorized as a severe storm tropical cyclone flood has dramatically increased since 2005 these numbers highlight the recent increasing trends of the occurrences of wet catastrophic events especially for severe storm events statistically the annual economic losses due to the billion dollar weather disasters for the us have increased significantly about 5 per year smith and katz 2013 in which the wet events have a significant contribution the extreme precipitations events are often associated with hurricanes and tropical storms in the us for example huang et al 2018 indicated that the main reason for the abrupt increase in extreme precipitation over the northeastern united states is due to the occurrence of the hurricane and tropical storms and these are typically fueled by the warmer atlantic ocean temperature that heats up the atmospheric water vapor hurricanes often lead to extreme precipitation events that can cause significant damage to the us economy for example two major hurricanes occurred in the same year 2017 are a the hurricane harvey which devastated houston texas august 26th 28th followed by b hurricane irma september 9th 11th that caused significant damage to florida these two hurricanes resulted in a total economic loss for the united states in an excess of 125 billion aon 2018 the natural disasters such as the hurricanes harvey and irma highlighted the need for quantitative estimation of the risk of such disasters emanuel 2017 in our study we identified six extreme precipitation events occurred in the usa during the period of 2011 2017 and these extreme events are displayed in fig 2 by prism precipitation data daly et al 1994 the accumulated 3 day precipitation due to hurricane harvey over houston texas was about 800 mm fig 2a and the 500 mm of precipitation is equivalent to a return period of 2000 years for the same location emanuel 2017 hurricane harvey the eighth named storm of the 2017 atlantic hurricane season was recognized as the wettest tropical cyclone ever recorded to hit the usa ellenrieder 2018 leading to the unprecedented amount of precipitation and massive inland flooding in the greater houston area risser and wehner 2017 hurricane irma a category 5 storm editorial 2017 considered to be the most powerful storm ever recorded in the atlantic hurricane brought massive precipitation accompanied by strong wind gusts and storm surge the maximum precipitation occurred during hurricane irma at fort pierce fl was about 400 mm with the maximum wind gust of 230 km h prior to irma the magnitude of extreme precipitation from a no name storm in louisiana aug 2016 was recognized as the 1000 year event which resulted in three times as much precipitation as hurricane katrina samenow 2016 nws 2016 this extreme precipitation in lousiana resulted in flash flooding river flooding and backwater flooding over a period of time the lousiana official reported that over 30 000 people rescued and at least 60 600 homes had been impacted and this event reported to have killed at least 13 people van der wiel et al 2017 another thousand year precipitation event occurred near the coast of south carolina in oct 2015 mizzell et al 2016 marciano and lackmann 2017 that resulted in 430 mm of precipitation over four consecutive days this extreme precipitation event caused higher flood damage due to unusually high tides due to the recent perigean spring tide and saturated soil moisture due to the heavy precipitation in late september crn 2016 the maximum daily precipitation sep 2013 of magnitude 230 mm recorded at boulder colorado led to front range flood yochum and moore 2013 which is considered to be one of the most extreme major flood disasters the annual exceedance probability for this extreme precipitation event was as low as 1 1000 gochis et al 2015 nws 2013 several states in the northeastern united states witnessed severe flooding due to hurricane irene and the remnants of tropical storm lee in late august early september 2011 that resulted in total damage of 7 billion and approximately 45 deaths suro et al 2011 among the six recent extreme event locations boulder is located in the continental subarctic climate region and the remaining five locations are located in the mediterranean climate region degu et al 2011 these most recent catastrophic events occurred in a different part of the us at different times resulted in the major socio economic loss the overall goal of this study is to i identify the best covariates between time daily maximum temperature annual average temperature and enso that has potential influence on the most recent extreme precipitation events in the united states ii to derive the updated return levels and return periods of these extreme precipitation events in the context of nonstationary frequency analysis and iii to evaluate the perspective of nonstationary information on the return periods in order to highlight the necessity of the revised idf curves for infrastructure designs 2 data and choices of covariates 2 1 extreme values of precipitation data the daily precipitation and maximum minimum temperature for the six selected locations were obtained from the global historical climatology network ghcn ftp ftp ncdc noaa gov pub data ghcn daily table 1 these locations recently witnessed extreme precipitation events discussed in section 1 1 and the data sets are available for longer time periods with less than 1 missing value additional information on these selected stations are provided in table 1 and their locations are shown in fig 2 mean daily temperature value is averaged based on the maximum and minimum temperature recorded for the same day in general three different methods are commonly used to identify extreme precipitation events mishra and singh 2010 and they are classified based on their amount specific thresholds and annual maxima values in this study extreme precipitation events are calculated based on the annual maximum 24 h precipitation time series the 1 3 5 consecutive days of annual maximum precipitation amr time series are derived and they are denoted by 1 day 3 day and 5 day amr the 3 day amr time series for all six selected stations and the date of occurrence of the most recent extreme events are presented in fig 3 overall it was observed that the magnitude of recent extreme events is comparatively much higher than previous events 2 2 choices of covariates for non stationary analysis in this section we provide an overview of the selected covariates and their potential influence on extreme events the temperature can be considered as an important covariate because the warmer atmosphere is likely to hold more moisture thereby generating a favorable condition for an increase in precipitation romero et al 2011 in addition to that based on the clausius claperon relationship a stronger relationship between daily maximum temperature and extreme precipitation events was observed compared to average temperature herath et al 2018 clausius clapeyron relationship also reveals the increase in saturated specific humidity in the warmer air by 6 7 per degree kelvin of local warming in the absence of any dynamical change risser and wehner 2017 therefore the maximum daily temperature can be considered as an important covariate in the nonstationary analysis of extreme precipitation in addition to that changes in local temperature can have a significant correlation with extreme precipitation intensity and frequency compared to the global process mondal and mujumdar 2015 agilan and umamahesh 2017 highlighted the strong correlation between change in local temperature and sub hourly duration extreme precipitation events for a station in india in our study we considered the local annual average temperature as an additional covariate to study their influence on extreme precipitation events several studies sarhadi and soulis 2017 son et al 2017 included time covariate in the non stationary analysis and therefore it is included as an additional covariate to study the nonstationary process for the recent extreme precipitation events in the united states large scale climate indices e g enso likely to influence local weather conditions enso el niño southern oscillation is a coupled ocean atmosphere phenomenon associated with the fluctuations in the sea surface temperature located in the tropical pacific the extreme phases of enso has a potential influence on precipitation anomalies in many geographic locations around the world mason and goddard 2001 and especially it has significant influence on extreme precipitation events over the contiguous united states yu et al 2017 deflorio et al 2013 schubert et al 2008 gershunov and barnett 1998 mishra and singh 2010 there are several indices used to represent the phase and strength of enso events hanley et al 2003 typically the commonly used indices are the regional sea surface temperature stt in the equatorial pacific niño 1 2 niño 3 niño 4 niño 3 4 niño 3 4 is a widely used index of enso activity and it is calculated by averaging the kaplan extended sst anomalies kaplan et al 1998 in the region comprising 5s 5 n and 170 w 120 w previously niño 3 4 was used as a covariate for modeling nonstationary precipitation agilan and umamahesh 2017 son et al 2017 mondal and mujumdar 2015 risser and wehner 2017 in this study we selected niño 3 4 based on extended reconstructed sst ersst data set averaged over the november to march as an additional covariate to represent the large scale climate phenomenon for nonstationary analysis of extreme precipitation events 3 methodology 3 1 nonstationary extreme value analysis it is often useful to study the extreme precipitation events based on longer durations e g few days due to the lag time associated between excessive precipitation and hydrologic flooding mishra and singh 2010 therefore the extreme precipitation values in the present study were derived based on maximum annual precipitation amounts at different time scales 1 3 and 5 days the distributions of extreme values fisher and tippett 1928 include three families gumbel fréchet and weibull all three families are combined into the generalized extreme values distribution gev jenkinson 1955 the gev was used to derive both stationary and nonstationary models the cumulative distribution function cdf of the gev family has the functional form jenkinson 1955 1 g z exp 1 ξ z μ σ 1 ξ where μ σ ξ are the location scale and shape parameter respectively according to fisher and tippett 1928 for ξ 0 the distribution is called gumbel ξ 0 refers to fréchet and the ξ 0 is corresponding to weibull distribution coles 2001 several methods are developed to estimate the gev model parameters such as maximum likelihood estimation mle smith 1985 probability weighted moment hosking et al 1985 l moments hosking 1990 method of moments madsen et al 1997 and generalized maximum likelihood estimators adlouni et al 2007 in our study we utilized the mle method to estimate the gev parameters for nonstationary analysis and the similar method was applied in previous studies agilan and umamahesh 2017 risser and wehner 2017 mondal and mujumdar 2015 the conventional spatial bootstrap technique was applied for the significance test to determine the uncertainty bounds and also to estimate the return levels and the return periods 3 2 models and covariates in the nonstationary analysis the parameters are expressed as a function of covariates as discussed earlier section 2 2 four covariates were selected for nonstationary analysis of extreme precipitation which includes i annual average daily temperature tm c ii the max daily temperature tx c recorded at the time the extreme events occurred iii the seasonal average ersst over niño 3 4 region for the djfm months to represent the influence of natural phenomenon e and iv time in year y different combinations of covariates are provided in table 2 the time varying gev distribution was applied by varying the location and scale parameters as a function of selected covariates however the shape parameter is kept constant as it may be unrealistic to assume shape parameter as a smooth function of time coles 2001 and it is advisable to use the constant shape for a small number of stations cooley et al 2007 similar assumption has been made in recent studies sarhadi and soulis 2017 risser and wehner 2017 agilan and umamahesh 2017 for each of the couple station duration there are 21 models are derived which includes 1 stationary and 20 nonstationary models based on four covariates and two time varying parameters overall 18 best models were identified based on 378 models that were constructed based on a combination of 6 stations three types of extreme events durations and four types of covariates a brief description of the model formulation is discussed here and detailed information is provided in table 2 three model types are briefly discussed below model type 1 stationary model s0 three gev parameters are kept constant over time 2 μ t μ σ t σ ξ t ξ model type 2 a nonstationary model with varying location parameter

their associated covariates tm daily average temperature tx daily max temperature e enso and y time domain 3 3 identification of the best models the akaike information criterion aic was applied to identify the best model among 21 models table 2 for each station as well as different duration of extreme events the model that has minimum aic is selected as the best fit model makridakis et al 2003 the mathematical equation for aic is formulated as akaike 1974 5 aic 2 log l 2 m where m is the number of terms estimated in the model l is the likelihood function of the models with a monotonically decreasing function of the sum of squared residuals the aic penalizes the minimized negative log likelihood for the number of parameters estimated katz 2013 mishra and desai 2005 aic is commonly used to select the best model and it has been used for nonstationary analysis risser and wehner 2017 agilan and umamahesh 2017 mondal and mujumdar 2015 the aic values were computed for all the selected 21 models based on the 1 3 5 day annual maximum precipitation at six stations the selected best model is then compared with stationary model s0 using the likelihood ratio test lr with 95 confidence intervals coles 2001 if the test is insignificant then the stationary model s0 is considered as the best model the best models based on the different types of extreme precipitation events at six locations are provided in table 3 3 4 estimation of the nonstationary return period the nonstationary frequency analysis models were developed based on past observations by excluding the recent extreme event for example the historical amr data was considered up to 2016 for model development for fort pierce station hurricane irma in 2017 once the nonstationary models are identified the return period for extreme events e g hurricane irma in 2017 are computed based on the model parameters based on the sets of the corresponding covariates tx tm e y of the current year once the best nonstationary model was identified the corresponding return period for the recent extreme events was computed and compared with the corresponding return period from stationary gev fitting the formulation for the return period based on the stationary nonstationary model is given by the equation 6 rp 1 1 exp 1 ξ z μ t σ t 1 ξ where z is the corresponding amr value of the extreme event and μ t σ t ξ are the location scale and shape parameters for corresponding nonstationary stationary models specified in equations 2 3 and 4 the estimated model parameters and standard errors associated with the best models table 3 are provided in table 4 the revised return periods for the most recent extreme precipitation events are provided in table 5 finally the change in the return periods for the selected extreme events between nonstationary and stationary can be computed as in equation 7 7 reduction nrp s r p nrp 100 where nrp and srp represent the return periods based on the nonstationary and stationary approach 4 results 4 1 nonstationary analysis and best covariates for selected models the best models for the six selected stations are provided in table 3 and their corresponding gev parameters are tabulated in table 4 overall 18 best models from 378 models are identified for three temporal precipitation durations at six locations out of these 18 best models only 2 models follow stationary gev s0 and 16 models follow nonstationary processes the nonstationary models vary based on their location and scale parameters due to the different potential influence of covariates the nonstationary models performed well based on all the amr time series for the selected station located in houston texas it was observed that clausius claperon relationship holds true for this location where a strong relationship was observed between maximum daily temperature and extreme precipitation both the covariates max daily temperature and time have a potential influence on the nonstationary nature ns5 and ns16 of the 1 and 3 day amr time series it also implies that the change in temperature during the post climatic period 1965 mishra and singh 2010 has a potential influence on amr in a recent study risser and wehner 2017 highlighted that global warming is likely to increase the chances of the largest 7 day precipitation total by a factor of at least 3 5 for most of the affected areas in houston based on the similar analysis over fort pierce station fl the average local temperature tm and daily maximum temperature tx are the most influencing covariates for nonstationary extreme precipitation analysis for the longer duration 3 and 5 days amr time series the nonstationary analysis for the charleston station reveals that the 1 day amr follows stationary processes s0 however at longer duration both 3 and 5 day amr performed well by nonstationary models ns1 based on time varying location parameters it implies that the stationary idf curve best describes the 1 day amr in charleston while for the 3 day and 5 day accumulated events the nonstationary processes with time varying location parameters are the best models to demonstrate the extreme precipitation behavior in fact the 5 days october 1 5 2015 accumulated precipitation led to a historic flooding event and flash flooding was prevalent that led to significant damage to civil infrastructure systems and many people having to be rescued by emergency personnel table 3 clearly demonstrates the potential influence of covariates on the nonstationary nature of extreme precipitation events in baton rouge lousiana the best model identified for 1 day amr is different from 3 and 5 day amr in this case 3 and 5 day amr follows similar nonstationary models based on varying location and scale parameters whereas time and enso found to be important covariates for 1 day amr in a recent study van der wiel et al 2017 highlighted that the return period of 3 day amr event in louisiana 2016 is about 550 years with 95 confidence interval and the intensity of extreme precipitation events of this return time have increased since 1900 further the authors suggested that the regional probability of 3 day extreme precipitation increases by more than a factor of 1 4 due to anthropogenic climate change our results point towards the potential influence of enso on extreme precipitation and van der wiel et al 2017 highlighted that the evidence for a relation to el niño half a year earlier can be possible with some analyses showing a positive connection and others none similarly nonstationary models performed well for the other two stations located in bay boro station north carolina and boulder colorado in the case of boulder station all the covariates contribute to the 1 day amr however 5 day amr at bay boro station followed a stationary model in addition to that the best models for 1 and 3 day amr at bay boro station includes enso as potential covariates overall most 16 out of 18 of the stations as well as the duration of extreme precipitation followed a nonstationary pattern there are six best models follow the time based covariates for location and scale parameters that represent 30 of the total number of models baton rouge and charleston are most likely time based nonstationary models for higher durations 3 and 5 day extreme precipitation about six models 30 exhibit the significant relationship between combined covariates with extreme precipitation for shorter 1 and 3 day duration in general for most of the locations the frequency analysis of 5 day amr show a significant relationship with only one covariate and the choice of covariate varies for a different location the gev parameters estimated from different best models and their corresponding standard errors are provided in table 4 4 2 revised return levels based on the nonstationary approach the nonstationary frequency analysis was performed based on the available data prior to the occurrence of the recent extreme events the corresponding return levels periods were computed based on the gev parameters table 4 obtained from the nonstationary analysis of the best models the nonstationary return levels based on 50 100 and 500 year return period using 3 day amr data sets for the best models are provided in fig 4 it can be observed that the nonstationary return levels vary with time in contrast to the stationary return level the time varying covariate in location parameter model ns1 charleston fig 4d indicates return levels with a linear pattern having a mild slope along the time domain in the case of time varying location and scale varying parameters ns12 model fig 4c the corresponding return level witness a moderate slope based on the linear return levels the steep slopes associated with return levels fig 4c indicates the reduction in return period with respect to recent time periods in other word the large magnitude of storms is becoming more common in recent times risser and wehner 2017 the return level patterns likely to be influenced by the type of covariates the oscillating pattern of non stationary return levels depends on the choice of covariates for example the return levels with enso as a covariate ns3 fig 4f fluctuates with the variation of sst unlike the linear increasing trend observed based on the time covariate a similar observation was made based on the time and enso covariates model ns6 for boulder station fig 4e it was observed that the return levels associated with enso covariate may not follow a significant increasing or decreasing trend the best model for fort pierce station ns17 fig 4b incorporates time and mean temperature as covariates that result in significant increasing trends for all the return periods it is slightly different from fig 4c where only time covariate was considered the oscillation of the return level is due to the effect of mean temperature covariates it is worth to highlight that the 3 day maximum amr extreme event precipitation 570 mm recorded during hurricane irma at fort pierce fig 4b represents 500 year return period based on the nonstationary analysis however this return period is comparatively higher based on the stationary analysis the recorded 3 day amr event from hurricane harvey fig 4a is higher than 500 year return period based on the nonstationary process ns16 model that includes time and maximum temperature as covariates along with location and scale parameters overall it was observed that the temporal pattern of return levels varies with the covariates some of the covariates may lead to a linearly increasing trend e g time and land use change due to urbanization in nonstationary return level whereas some of the covariates e g maximum daily temperature and enso likely to oscillate with no clear pattern of increasing decreasing trend may induce similar behavior with return levels as well however the combination of time and other covariates for example enso ns6 and mean temperature ns17 may result in an increase in the return level trend fig 4c and 3f respectively the return level and return period are estimated for each studied station for 1 day 3 day and 5 day amr fig 5 demonstrates the nonstationary return level for 3 day amr time series based on 500 year return period along with its uncertainty the continuous red line represents the return level based on a 500 year return period and the green and blue bands exhibit the 60 and 95 confidence intervals respectively and they are computed using the bootstrapping technique the 95 confidence interval compared to 60 indicates a steady increasing trend for fort pierce baton rouge and charleston fig 5b c d 4 3 intensity duration frequency curve from nonstationary analysis fig 6 compares the stationary and nonstationary intensity duration frequency idf curves derived based on the best model parameters table 4 the recent extreme precipitation events were compared against idf curves as shown in fig 6 the nonstationary idf curves were derived based on the best models that include time covariate fig 6c d maximum daily temperature and enso fig 6a time and enso fig 6e time and mean temperature fig 6b and enso only fig 6f it was observed that the nonstationary curves red lines are always higher than a stationary one black lines which suggests that the nonstationary models represent a reduced return period compared to the stationary ones revised return periods for different temporal resolutions based on the stationary and nonstationary frequency analysis are provided in table 5 it was observed that the magnitude of return periods of extreme event reduced significantly from stationary to the nonstationary case for example the amount of aggregated precipitation based on 3 and 5 days precipitation due to hurricane harvey houston station represents a return period of approximate 6700 and 5000 years respectively based on the stationary assumption these extremely high return periods are also highlighted in the literature by risser and wehner 2017 and emanuel 2017 however based on the nonstationary analysis the return period for these extreme events reduced to 4800 and 3900 years reduced by 30 and 25 respectively in the case of hurricane irma fort pierce fl the return periods based on the stationary assumption for 3 day amr and 5 day amr are close to 6300 and 5370 years respectively these numbers reduce to 800 and 3500 years 87 and 35 based on the nonstationary analysis it is important to highlight that the 5000 year return period of extreme precipitation does not correspond to the 5000 year return period of the flood event gochis et al 2015 similarly the return periods for other stations charleston boulder and bayboro are also greater than thousand years based on the 3 day amr table 5 the extreme precipitation events at different time scales witness a reduction in the return period based on the nonstationary gev analysis the percentage reduction in the return periods for all selected extreme events computed from nonstationary and stationary models as formulated in equation 7 shown in fig 7 all the nonstationary models exhibit a reduction in the return period compared to the stationary model that ranges from the lowest rate of 17 to the highest rate of 87 the study clearly highlights that the occurrence of similar extreme precipitation events likely to be more frequent when the return periods are reduced based on the nonstationary analysis for example the return period of 3 day extreme events at barton rogue reduced from 177 to 60 years based on the nonstationary analysis this does not mean that the two extreme events will not occur in a short period of time for example two severe most hurricanes harvey and irma occurred in a month in 2017 it is important to highlight that the percentage change between stationary and nonstationary return periods is not consistent among temporal resolutions i e 1 3 5 days and they vary at different locations however some of the prominent changes were observed for coastal locations with respect to recent extreme events for example baton rouge 66 and 68 based on the 3 and 5 days events fort pierce 87 based on the 3 day extreme events and bay boro 64 based on the 1 day extreme events 5 discussion and conclusion one of the key information required to design major civil infrastructure systems includes intensity duration and frequency of heavy precipitation events these precipitation characteristics are combined to construct intensity duration frequency idf curves which are typically derived based on the stationary assumption the idf curves are widely used for designing civil infrastructure systems for example designing of hydraulic structures against the impact of extreme events e g extreme precipitation floods the models used to derive return periods i e frequency analysis are generally developed based on the assumption that hydrological events e g annual maximum rainfall and flood discharges arise from a stationary hydrological regime however it has been reported in the literature that the hydrological cycle has been changing leading to significant changes in the spatio temporal distribution of occurrences of extreme events thus there is a need to revisit idf curves as well as to develop new methods where there is sufficient evidence of nonstationarity in addition the selection of return periods depend on additional variables such as cost of damages vulnerability and climate risk that needs to be incorporated to develop economic risk based decision approach this is specifically important for countries frequently affected by the severe storm events for example in singapore the idf curves are typically updated once per decade singapore pub 2012 to cope up with the changing climate condition in order to improve the resilience of infrastructure systems the nonstationary idf curves can be explored during the design phase of the infrastructure in order to evaluate the cost and benefit with respect to stationary idf curves especially when these curves are not updated recently in this study we performed the nonstationary frequency analysis of the most recent historical precipitation events occurred between 2011 and 2017 over the united states overall six extreme precipitation events are selected and their corresponding amr time series are constructed based on annual maximum 1 3 and 5 days aggregated values the return period of extreme precipitation events are likely to be influenced by the occurrence of the extreme events within a short period of time for example two thousand year return period precipitation extreme events occurred hurricane harvey and irma in 2017 the following conclusions can be drawn from this study a while the stationary frequency analysis is commonly used for civil infrastructure design recently multiple studies highlighted the increase in the nonstationary pattern of extreme events in this study we performed stationary nonstationary frequency based on six extreme precipitation events during the period 2011 2017 overall 378 stationary nonstationary models were evaluated for three types 1 3 5 day amr of extreme precipitation events at six locations and 18 best models were identified it was observed that most approx 90 of the extreme precipitation events follow the nonstationary pattern over the selected time period this may be due to the increase in the magnitude of recent extreme precipitation events especially during hurricane events b the selection of physical covariates is an important step for nonstationary frequency analysis overall four distinct covariates are identified for nonstationary frequency analysis which includes large scale climate index enso time covariate local annual average temperature and maximum daily temperature during the occurrence of the events different combination of covariates can potentially influence the nonstationary frequency analysis therefore sensitivity test is an important step to identify best covariates different combination of covariates is evaluated for a different type of extreme precipitation patterns at six locations witnessing different climate patterns it was observed that there is not a single covariate that is most sensitive to the nonstationary frequency analysis in all of the cases in fact the combination of several covariates can perform better than using a single covariate for example 1 day amr time series followed a stationary pattern and time varying covariate for 3 day and 5 day amr time series all other stations durations have a different combination of covariates c the temporal pattern of nonstationary return level depends on the extreme value distribution parameters e g location and scale parameters and the choice of covariates for example based on the time covariate e g ns1 and ns12 model a linearly increasing trend may be expected for nonstationary return level whereas the return levels based on enso and temperature likely to oscillate over time compared to time covariate this is due to the temporal variation of the sea surface temperature and change in local temperature over a period of time therefore more studies are necessary to quantify the potential physical mechanism between extreme events and corresponding influencing variables d using the best nonstationary models the intensity duration frequency curves were constructed based on the combination of 6 stations and 3 durations for comparison with stationary idf curves based on the nonstationary extreme value analysis the return periods associated with extreme precipitation events significantly reduced compared to the stationary approach although six representative extreme events at 3 different temporal resolutions 1 3 and 5 day consecutive are selected in this analysis an additional number of events can be investigated in the future research by incorporating more number of precipitation stations to quantify the heterogeneous nature of events within a spatial domain in the process of choosing more number of stations for a particular event may lead to a different set of model parameters and covariates and such analysis is required to investigate the extreme events at a regional scale e the extreme precipitations events are often associated with hurricanes and tropical storms in the us therefore in addition to annual maxima approach discussed in this study additional extreme value distribution such as generalized pareto can be applied to peak over threshold pot data set to capture various extreme precipitation events that occurred within the year further the return periods based on the nonstationary model can be influenced by data length parameter estimation techniques as well as the type of the covariates therefore in depth analysis is further required to minimize the uncertainty associated with such influencing variables declaration of competing interest we have no conflict of interest to report acknowledgement we very much appreciate the editor and reviewer s critical and valuable comment that
