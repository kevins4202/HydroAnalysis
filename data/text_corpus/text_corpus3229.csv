16145,microbial fuel cells mfcs can generate electrical energy from the oxidation of the organic matter but they must be demonstrated at large scales treat real wastewaters and show the required performance needed at a site to provide a path forward for this technology previous pilot scale studies of mfc technology have relied on systems with aerated catholytes which limited energy recovery due to the energy consumed by pumping air into the catholyte in the present study we developed deployed and tested an 850 l 1400 l total liquid volume air cathode mfc treating domestic type wastewater at a centralized wastewater treatment facility the wastewater was processed over a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 h through a sequence of 17 brush anode modules 11 m2 total projected anode area and 16 cathode modules each constructed using two air cathodes 0 6 m2 each total cathode area of 20 m2 with the air side facing each other to allow passive air flow the mfc effluent was further treated in a biofilter bf to decrease the organic matter content the field test was conducted for over six months to fully characterize the electrochemical and wastewater treatment performance wastewater quality as well as electrical energy production were routinely monitored the power produced over six months by the mfc averaged 0 46 0 35 w 0 043 w m 2 normalized to the cross sectional area of an anode at a current of 1 54 0 90 a with a coulombic efficiency of 9 approximately 49 15 of the chemical oxygen demand cod was removed in the mfc alone as well as a large amount of the biochemical oxygen demand bod5 70 and total suspended solid tss 48 in the combined mfc bf process up to 91 6 of the cod and 91 of the bod5 were removed as well as certain bacteria e coli 98 9 fecal coliforms 99 1 the average effluent concentration of nitrate was 1 6 2 4 mg l 1 nitrite was 0 17 0 24 mg l 1 and ammonia was 0 4 1 0 mg l 1 the pilot scale reactor presented here is the largest air

et al 2018 munoz cupa et al 2021 in an mfc oxidation of the biodegradable organic matter by exoelectrogenic bacteria on the anode is coupled with the oxygen reduction reaction orr at the cathode to produce electrical power logan et al 2019 mfcs have primarily being tested in lab or bench scale reactors often using only synthetic wastewaters characterized by high buffer capacities and substrate concentrations that are not representative of typical domestic wastewaters logan et al 2015 mfcs need to be demonstrated at pilot scale treating real waste streams and showing sufficient performance to provide a path forward for implementation of this technology zhang et al 2013 scaling up mfcs is technically challenging due to the need for a high electrode packing density m2 of electrode per m3 of reactor while increasing reactor capacity to maximize the reactor performance if the electrode specific surface area is not maintained during reactor scale up from lab to pilot scale the volumetric power densities will decrease due to the lack of sufficient electrode specific surface area logan et al 2015 mfcs with low electrode packing densities typically produce low volumetric power due to the large spacing between the electrodes which increases the solution resistance and restricts the performance of the reactor rossi et al 2020 however maintaining a similar electrode packing density during scale up requires cathodes able to withstand high water head pressure in order to avoid flooding of the cathode and the cathode chamber dekker et al 2009 the orr at the cathode uses oxygen to consume electrons generated by the anode thus the orr catalyst needs to be in contact with either dissolved oxygen in liquid media or with air popat and torres 2016 rossi et al 2020 most of the previous mfc pilot scale reactors larger than 250 l have used wastewater aeration rather than direct air cathodes feng et al 2014 liang et al 2018 2019 vilajeliu pons et al 2017 wastewater aeration is undesirable as it currently consumes about half the energy used at a treatment plant and therefore direct air cathodes are preferred to reduce energy demands however as the volume of the reactor and the electrode dimensions are increased the water pressure on the liquid side of the cathode can result in leakage and water flooding of the cathode chamber one of the largest air cathode reactors constructed to date 250 l had horizontal plug flow across two cathodes each 1 m2 separated by 25 cm in order to minimize hydrostatic pressure and prevent water leakage feng et al 2014 the mfc module produced a power density of 0 057 0 001 w m 2 with a cod removal rate of 76 3 the mfc was estimated to reduce energy costs compared to a conventional wastewater treatment by half although expensive precious metal catalysts increased the capital costs of the reactor the pt c cathodes accounted for up to 50 of the overall cost of the mfc a new cathode with no precious metal catalyst and capable of withstanding higher water heights 0 7 m was recently developed hiegemann et al 2019 rossi et al 2019a 2019b the window pane architecture of these cathodes contained panels using activated carbon catalysts with the cathodes welded and glued into a stainless steel frame the cathode was used in mfcs to produce a maximum power density of 0 101 0 006 w m 2 with 0 62 m2 of cathode in a reactor of 85 l 7 3 m2 m 3 which was of the same order of magnitude of the power densities obtained in smaller laboratory scale mfcs fed domestic wastewater 0 31 0 01 w m 2 in a reactor of 28 ml rossi et al 2019 in this study we developed and tested the largest air cathode mfc using primarily domestic wastewater generated at a field site tobyhanna army depot us multi panel cathodes 32 each containing 15 activated carbon cathode panels 0 032 m2 each total active area 15 m2 were welded into metal sheets producing a total cathode surface area of 20 m2 these cathodes were placed into 0 85 m3 of the tank that had a total volume of 1 4 m3 volume including influent and effluent zones achieving a final electrode packing density of 23 m2 m 3 this packing density was comparable to that obtained in much smaller mfcs 25 m2 m 3 logan et al 2015 therefore achieving negligible loss 6 in electrode packing densities with increased reactor size the mfc was integrated into an existing wastewater treatment facility at the site and the effluent of the mfc provided the influent to a biofiltration bf unit ward et al 2015 to further treat the wastewater to meet low effluent cod requirements the combined mfc and bf technologies were designed assembled and integrated into an automated pilot scale wastewater treatment skid that could treat up to 3 79 liters per minute lpm of wastewater the combined treatment system was assessed over a six month period from september 2020 through april 2021 despite having limited personnel at the site due to the covid 19 pandemic over the course of the pilot study the system performance was measured in terms of water quality and energy production and consumption for various relevant modes of operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 construction and operation of the mfc the mfc intuitech utah was a 1400 l including inlet and outlet 850 l active electrolyte occupied by anode and cathode modules pvc tank 2 4 m long by 1 2 m wide by 0 7 m tall fig 1 the wastewater was fed through a manifold to distribute the flow across the height of the module and the wastewater effluent from the mfc was delivered by gravity to the bf unit the mfc contained 17 anode modules supporting information with 40 carbon fiber brush anodes each made using two twisted titanium wires 2 5 cm diameter 61 cm brush length 71 cm overall length the total anode projected area was 11 m2 the brush anodes of each module were electrically connected and wired to the control panel cathodes 1 1 m wide by 0 6 m long 0 62 m2 exposed area 0 48 m2 electroactive area due to the stainless steel frame were purchased from vito belgium mol following a design previously described rossi et al 2019b and assembled in the final cathode module the cathodes were manufactured to be permeable to air on one side 30 diffusion layer porosity and impermeable to water on the other side using a proprietary manufacturing process bouwman et al 2020 each cathode module 16 total 2 cathodes each supporting information was assembled using two air cathodes secured 5 cm apart in the module with the air sides facing each other air chamber and the solution side in contact with the wastewater in the mfc to reduce the cathode deformation due to the pressure of the water on the cathode a support structure that was integral to the side plates of the cathodes was used in the air chamber supporting information the electrode spacing between anode and cathode was 1 2 cm the anode modules closer to the mfc influent and effluent were connected to one cathode each the remaining anode modules 15 were connected to two cathodes one on each side of the brushes the cathodes were wired to the control board and the anode cathode voltage and current were continuously recorded with a multimeter keithley 2700 and 2750 the control board performed maximum power point tracking and allowed continuous measurement of each anode cathode pair performance in terms of current and voltage produced avoided voltage reversal and boosted the final voltage output to either 12 v 18 v or 24 v the design of the pilot scale mfc is described in greater detail in the supporting information the performance of the mfc was continuously evaluated through measurement of the current voltage and power output from each anode cathode pair 32 channels the power and current density were normalized by the cross sectional area of the anode module 0 62 m2 each 11 m2 total or the cathode module 0 62 m2 each 20 m2 total the volumetric power was normalized by the active volume of the mfc 850 l neglecting the inlet and outlet zones as these areas were included to facilitate sampling inspection and troubleshooting during the initial three months of operation voltage and current were monitored with a separate multimeter keithley 2700 voltmeter by connecting each anode module to the two cathodes closest to it through a 4 9 0 6 ω external resistor following the startup and acclimation phase in the initial three months of operation the control board was installed in the control panel allowing a continuous monitoring of the current voltage and power output of the mfc the mfc net energy recovery net was calculated by normalizing the kwh produced over six months by the amount of wastewater treated wh m 3 or cod degraded wh kgcod 1 sampling methods and additional details on the inoculation and operation of the pilot scale mfc bf are described in greater detail in the supporting information 2 2 effluent treatment using the bf after wastewater treatment in the mfc a bf polishing system fig 2 was utilized to provide further reduction of cod and suspended solids the bf system employs high surface area granular activated carbon filtration media that is biologically active allowing for simultaneous physical and biological treatment via adsorption and subsequent biodegradation of both dissolved and particulate contaminants the pilot scale bf unit was composed of a 76 l pvc rectangular tank for feed water two upflow 300 l plexiglass hexagonal tanks 0 33 m2 area by 0 9 m tall filled two thirds of the height with 200 l activated carbon aquacarb 816 evoqua usa and a 76 l pvc rectangular water holding tank for ultrafiltration uf feed followed by a uf module cantel fiberflo hollow fiber cartridge 0 2 micron filter size 7 4 cm outside diameter 51 cm length and a uv device for disinfection aquisense technologies erlanger kentucky usa the bf unit was continuously fed by a suction pump to maintain a design flux of 5 76 lpm m2 while loading the air operated pinch valves were integrated to control the flow path during bf loading and bioregeneration phases 3 results and discussion 3 1 mfc performance the total power produced by the mfc quickly increased during the inoculation stage from 0 01 w to 0 65 w 1 5 a over the initial three days of operation producing an average power density for each module of 0 061 0 008 w m 2 normalized by anode area 11 m2 indicating that the mfc was capable of delivering power in less than a week following inoculation the average power produced over six months was 0 46 0 35 w 0 54 0 41 w m 3 at an average current of 1 54 0 90 a the average power density of the pilot mfc was 0 023 0 017 w m 2 0 077 0 045 a m 2 normalized by cathode surface area 20 m2 and 0 043 0 033 w m 2 0 145 0 085 a m 2 normalized by the anode surface area 11 m2 the mfc maximum power was 1 43 w 1 68 w m 3 at 2 95 a recorded 81 days after inoculation at the maximum power point the power density was 0 135 w m 2 at a current density of 0 278 a m 2 based on the anode surface area or 0 072 w m 2 normalized by cathode area this maximum power density was 34 higher than that obtained with an 85 l mfc 0 101 0 006 w m 2 that used similar materials based on polarization data rossi et al 2019a here two cathodes were connected to one anode compared to only one cathode per anode in the previous study doubling the cathode surface area has been shown to increase power although not directly in proportion to the cathode area for example doubling the cathode area increased the maximum power by 62 in a 0 028 l reactor cheng and logan 2011 39 53 in a 0 1 l mfc kim et al 2015 and by 67 in a 6 1 l mfc he et al 2016 a polarization curve was obtained after 81 days of operation from three modules in the mfc by decreasing the external resistance from 100 ω to 0 5 ω allowing 20 minutes between one resistance and the next to allow the voltage to stabilize the maximum power density was 0 172 0 003 w m 2 with an internal resistance of 1 00 0 04 ω m2 determined from the slope of the polarization curve near the maximum power point supporting information figure s10 the large difference in performance between continuous operation 0 135 w m 2 and the polarization curve 0 172 0 003 w m 2 indicates that the power density was overestimated during the polarization test due to the rapid change in resistances over time 20 minutes which has been proved to be effective in small scale systems but which does not allow large electrodes to fully discharge their capacitive current liang et al 2019 velasquez orta et al 2009 after the initial inoculation stage with fed batch operation wastewater was fed to the mfc at different flow rates producing changes in mfc performance primarily due to variations in the organic content of the wastewater and the rate of wastewater flow into the system fig 3 the low population on the site during nights weekends and holidays did not allow for a stable and continuous feed of wastewater in the mfc which was further complicated by the reduced personnel on site due to covid 19 occupancy restrictions the wastewater flow rate was changed from 1 89 lpm during the day 8 am 3 pm five days a week to 0 76 lpm overnight 3 pm 8 am and completely interrupted 0 lpm during the weekends the lower flow rate overnight decreased the organic loading fed to the mfc diminishing the total power produced by the mfc fig 3 after 80 days of operation the maximum power peaked at 1 30 w at 8 pm decreasing by 35 to 0 84 w at 11 am the following day due to the lower flowrate overnight the lag time between the decrease of the flow rate and the decrease in the performance was likely due to the high hrt of the mfc 12 h at 1 89 lpm and 30 h with 0 76 lpm interrupting the wastewater flow during the weekend further decreased the total power to only 0 03 w before restarting the system the following week the large impact of the flow rate on the performance indicated that the mfc performance was primarily limited by the low organic loading during the weekends at low flow rates and that the mfc power generation can be increased by maintaining a high cod content in the system even though the power decrease at low flow rates was substantial the mfc performance quickly recovered as soon as the wastewater feed was reestablished indicating a high resiliency of the reactor to operational shocks such as low cod concentrations fig 3 the anode cathode pairs produced variable current and power depending on their position in the mfc fig 4 the modules closer to the inlet and outlet produced an average of 46 less power than the modules positioned in the middle of the tank likely due to the larger intrusion of air into the media and to the lower cathode surface area only one cathode was connected to the anode modules next to the influent and effluent manifolds while two cathodes each were used for the remaining anode modules fig 1 after three months of operation the average power density over 9 hours of operation of the module next to the inlet was 0 041 0 001 w m 2 similar to the last module just before the wastewater outlet 0 033 0 002 w m 2 this power density was 73 smaller than that produced by the module in the middle of the mfc 0 152 0 003 w m 2 normalizing the power by the cathode surface area slightly decreases the difference in performance between the end modules and the other modules in the middle of the mfc average 0 077 0 003 w m 2 suggesting that oxygen intrusion can be a factor in limiting the performance of the anodes the average power density of the mfc decreased by 60 after six months of operation from 0 122 0 003 w m 2 total power of 1 3 w to 0 060 0 007 w m 2 total power of 0 6 w part of this decrease was due to cathode fouling for example the performance of an 85 l mfc using a cathode having a design similar to the one used here decreased by 28 after one month of operation primarily due to inorganic and biofouling of the cathode over time rossi et al 2019b some of this degradation in performance over time is due to the formation of a biofilm on the cathode the deposition of salts in the electrocatalytic structure and the adsorption of the organic matter present in the wastewater onto the cathode an et al 2017 in addition the decrease in the average power density for the total reactor was due to failure of water integrity of five cathode modules these modules developed leaks which resulted in flooding of the air chambers producing a large decrease in the performance of those anode cathode modules when the cathode chamber becomes filled with water there is little or no dissolved oxygen in the water and thus current generation is inhibited unless the water is sparged with air vilajeliu pons et al 2017 3 2 microbial community analysis the microbial community on the anode and cathode electrodes was analyzed after eight months of operation fig 5 sulfurimonas and desulfobacter were the most abundant genera on the electrodes of the mfc while the relative abundance of sulfurimonas increased from the influent to the outlet of the reactor desulfobacter followed the opposite trend being most present on the electrodes closer to the influent compared to the effluent desulfobacter is a sulfate reducing bacterium and was likely involved in the reduction of sulfate to sulfide as the wastewater flows through the mfc then due to the presence of the air cathodes and residual dissolved oxygen in solution sulfurimonas took over oxidizing the sulfide produced by desulfobacter this synergistic activity can be observed from the network analysis results indicating a significant p value 0 05 negative correlation between the two operational taxonomic units otus supporting information geobacter trichococcus desulfobacterium paludibacter and thauera showed an unequal distribution between anodes and cathodes geobacter and trichococcus were primarily concentrated on the anode trichococcus have rarely been reported on mfc anodes and typically only when solutions with high concentration of ammonia are fed to the reactor liu et al 2019 geobacter is a well known exoelectrogenic bacteria holmes et al 2004 and its distribution in the pilot mfc followed the same trend of the power density of the different modules fig 4 showing the highest concentration of geobacter in the modules in the middle of the mfc and the lowest in the anode modules closer to the influent and effluent the mfc modules next to the inlet and outlet were open to air in order to facilitate troubleshooting of the mfc and sampling however it has been previously shown that geobacter can tolerate and even utilize small amounts of oxygen to sustain its metabolism lin et al 2004 high dissolved oxygen concentrations however are detrimental to the bacterium suggesting that the oxygen intrusion in the wastewater close to the mfc influent and effluent could have limited its activity and the development of an exoelectrogenic biofilm desulfobacterium and paludibacter have been previously identified on mfc anodes in several studies huang et al 2012 kim et al 2011 li et al 2021 liang et al 2013 wang et al 2019 thauera which selectively colonized the cathode was previously detected in mfc studies more predominantly on the cathode shehab et al 2013 yang et al 2019 2018 zhang et al 2015 members of the genus thauera are known to play a role in denitrification daims et al 2010 and they were previously detected in mfcs operated for nitrogen removal sayess et al 2013 the detection of known genera responsible for nitrification such as nitrosomonas nitrobacter and nitrospira sayess et al 2013 at low relative abundance 0 13 0 16 coupled with the presence of nitrate and nitrite section 3 3 in the mfc reactor and the presence of thauera suggest the possibility of nitrification and denitrification occurring in the mfc reactor the overall microbial community structures collected from anodes and cathodes grew apart with the flow of wastewater i e from inlet to outlet fig 6 the community of anode17 and cathode17 which were located closest to the wastewater inlet had high similarity but diverged greatly with the wastewater flowing to the outlet from the middle to the outlet the electrochemical environment strongly influenced the divergence of microbial communities which were clustered by anode or cathode 3 3 mfc bf wastewater treatment performance a total volume of 110 m3 of wastewater was treated during the six month period of operation of the mfc with an average cod removal of 49 15 in the mfc alone and an overall 91 6 cod removal for the combined mfc bf technology fig 6a the average cod in the mfc influent was 425 114 mg l 1 which was decreased to 220 105 mg l 1 in the mfc effluent and to 36 23 mg l 1 in the bf effluent using the average cod removal in the mfc and the average current produced by the mfc resulted in a coulombic efficiency of approximately 9 the bf effluent was a clear liquid with no appreciable content of dispersed solids supporting information the tss concentration was reduced by 48 17 in the mfc from an average of 123 23 mg l 1 to 61 17 mg l 1 fig 6b the turbidity of the media decreased by 78 in the mfc and by an overall 97 post bf treatment supporting information in line with the decrease of cod and tss the average mfc influent turbidity was 60 ntu while the mfc effluent was 12 ntu and the bf effluent was 1 ntu indicating that most of the solids and particulate dispersed in solution was effectively removed during the mfc bf treatment the concentration of ammonia nitrite and nitrate in the mfc influent mfc effluent and post bf treatment was monitored after the inoculation stage of the mfc and throughout the whole study fig 7 the average ammonia concentration detected in the mfc influent was 33 27 mg l 1 and decreased by around 92 to 2 5 2 mg l 1 in the mfc effluent the ammonia concentration in the bf effluent averaged 0 4 1 mg l 1 previous studies have reported an ammonia removal in mfcs of approximately 60 for single chamber air cathode mfcs jung et al 2008 the ammonia is typically removed in mfcs by volatilization due to the conversion of ammonium ion to the more volatile ammonia species because of an elevated ph near the cathode jung et al 2008 motoyama et al 2021 however we cannot exclude the possibility of nitrification and denitrification occurring in the mfc reactor due to the presence of nitrate and nitrite and known genera responsible for nitrification and denitrification liang et al 2021 motoyama et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 nitrite concentrations decreased after treatment by the mfc from 0 16 0 04 mg l 1 to 0 06 0 02 mg l 1 the average concentration of nitrite in the bf effluent from week 6 to week 13 from startup was 0 03 0 04 mg l 1 and then increased in last few weeks of operation to 0 32 0 27 mg l 1 week 13 19 supporting information the increase in the nitrite concentration in the bf effluent was likely due to nitrification due to the higher loading of wastewater treated by the bf unit in the last weeks of the demonstration the bf was initially bypassed due to frequent clogging of the ultrafiltration unit and overflow in one granular activated carbon tank once these issues were resolved the bf was operated on a daily basis treating the mfc effluent the nitrate concentration followed a trend similar to the nitrite with a 41 decrease in the mfc from 0 78 0 40 mg l 1 to 0 47 0 31 mg l 1 followed by an increase in the bf effluent in the latter weeks of operation 3 1 2 7 mg l 1 from week 13 to week 19 the total nitrogen concentration decreased during the mfc bf treatment from 64 1 mg l 1 in the mfc influent to 29 3 mg l 1 in the mfc effluent and 11 4 mg l 1 post bf treatment indicating that the higher nitrate and nitrite concentrations in the bf effluent were due to nitrification the average sulfide and phosphorus concentrations are reported in the supporting information the quality of the wastewater in the mfc influent mfc effluent and bf effluent was analyzed in terms of bod5 fecal coliforms and e coli concentrations in a one month period collecting two samples per week supporting information the bod5 concentration followed a similar trend to that of the cod with a decrease of 70 in the mfc and of 91 post bf treatment the average influent bod5 was 146 mg l 1 which decreased to 44 mg l 1 in the mfc effluent and 13 mg l 1 in the bf effluent the fecal coliforms and e coli concentration decreased by two orders of magnitude through the mfc fecal coliforms influent 91 000 mpn ml 1 effluent 810 mpn ml 1 e coli influent 72 000 mpn ml 1 effluent 790 mpn ml 1 in the first two weeks of operation the fecal coliforms and e coli concentration in the bf effluent was 610 mpn ml 1 for both the strains the concentration of fecal coliforms and e coli was only 0 075 mpn ml 1 in the first three samples and increased to 24 mpn ml 1 in the last sample it was not clear if the higher content of microorganisms in the latter sample was due to a contamination during sampling or a decrease in the disinfection capability of the bf unit to investigate the impact of the ultrafiltration system on the bf disinfection capacity the uf membrane was removed over the last two weeks of operation and the concentration of fecal coliforms and e coli in the bf effluent was compared with that obtained in the presence of the uf unit the concentration of the fecal coliforms and e coli increased by two orders of magnitude in the absence of the uf unit fecal coliforms 220 mpn ml 1 e coli 180 mpn ml 1 over the last two weeks of operation suggesting that the ultrafiltration was more effective than the uv in reducing the content of microorganisms in the bf effluent at the end of the demonstration stage approximately after six months from the time of inoculation the mass of sludge accumulated in the mfc over the whole demonstration period was measured and analyzed in terms of tss and vss content the total wet weight of sludge was 88 2 kg with a tss of 40 3 g l 1 and a vss of 23 2 g l 1 the volume of wet sludge was approximately 91 l corresponding to a sludge accumulation of 0 9 l per 1000 l of wastewater treated and a sludge production of 0 16 kg tss per kg of cod removed conventional aerobic processes typically generate 0 32 kg tss per kg cod removed ginestet and camacho 2007 therefore 50 less sludge was generated in the mfc compared to conventional treatment 3 4 implications in the development and integration of mfcs in the wastewater treatment infrastructure we developed deployed and evaluated over six months the performance of the largest air cathode mfc ever produced providing data that can help with our insight for achieving practical deployment of bioelectrochemical systems in wastewater treatment plants the reactor startup was relatively fast even under challenging conditions of wastewater availability due to the low flow into the wet well suggesting that these systems could be used for rapid deployment less than 5 of the energy consumed by the pump to deliver the wastewater from the wet well to the mfc was recovered as electrical energy for example after three months of operation the mfc produced 11 4 wh at 1 89 lpm average power of 1 29 0 04 w over 9 h corresponding to only 3 of the energy consumed by the pump 401 wh however the energy generation in the mfc can likely be increased by maintaining a stable flow rate of a high strength wastewater even though the energy recovery and the power generation by the mfc were lower than expected the combined mfc bf technology treated domestic wastewater with a minimal energy consumption of only 0 13 wh l which is more than 75 lower than that of conventional wastewater treatment 0 6 wh l mccarty et al 2011 throughout the demonstration the mfc treated approximately 110 m3 of wastewater producing an average of 18 wh m 3 88 wh kgcod 1 of wastewater treated with peaks of 37 wh m 3 over a week of operation the mfc bf effluent quality met the water quality requirements for discharge from non municipal sewage treatment facilities for most of the parameters investigated ammonia 4 mg l 1 nitrate 10 mg l 1 ph 9 0 tss 30 mg l 1 and organic content 25 mg l 1 were all lower than the average monthly limit for discharge fecal coliforms were reduced below the required limit 20 mpn ml 1 only in the first three weeks of operation and were approximately nine times larger than the maximum limit in the last five samples indicating that higher stability of treatment performance should be achieved to avoid additional steps in the effluent disposal and the associated costs phosphorus concentration in the bf effluent was approximately 15 times larger than the maximum average monthly limit 4 mg l 1 requiring further approaches to manage the concentration of this chemical maintaining power density during system scale up is challenging but as shown here the volume of the reactor can be increased while producing power densities only slightly less than those obtained using smaller systems the pilot scale mfc maximum power density was 0 072 w m 2 based on the overall cathode area 20 m2 and 0 092 w m 2 neglecting the area of the cathode occupied by the stainless steel frame which decreased the electroactive area by 22 this power density is around one third of that previously reported for a 0 028 l cubic mfc 0 31 0 01 w m 2 fed domestic wastewater using the same anode and cathode materials and electrode spacing even though the active volume in the pilot mfc was 30 000 times larger this indicated that the electrode power density could be maintained in pilot scale mfcs if the reactor size was scaled up using reactor configurations similar to lab scale mfcs the power densities of the large air cathode mfc examined here were substantially higher than previous bioelectrochemical systems of similar scales 250 l the maximum power density in a previous study for a 250 l air cathode mfc was 0 057 1 w m 2 about 21 lower than that reported here 0 072 w m 2 and used a precious metal catalyst pt on the cathodes compared to activated carbon used here feng et al 2014 the maximum volumetric power density was 0 46 w m 3 which is less than one third of that obtained here 1 68 w m 3 feng et al 2014 the low volumetric power density was a consequence of the low electrode packing density in that study 8 m2 m 3 compared to 23 m2 m 3 here a maximum power density of only 0 007 w m 2 was reported in another study using a 720 l 6 reactors each of 120 l air cathode mfc das et al 2020 which is one order of magnitude smaller than that obtained here the much lower power density was likely a combination of the use of flat anodes carbon felt which produce lower power than carbon brushes yang et al 2017 and the low electrode packing density of the reactor 1 3 m2 m 3 the air cathode mfc examined here also had improved performance compared to large mfcs using aerated catholytes for example tests using a 1500 l mfc achieved maximum power densities of 0 036 w m 2 dong et al 2019 in one study and 0 029 w m 2 0 40 w m 3 in other tests he et al 2019 using aerated catholytes decreases the energy efficiency of the mfcs due to the need to sparge air in the catholyte high power densities have been reported for other mfcs which were defined as large scale systems based on total system volume but were constructed by combining several small scale systems so the power densities were not obtained for larger reactors babanova et al 2020 blatter et al 2021 ge and he 2016 liang et al 2019 for example a total system volume of 200 l was obtained by connecting 96 mfcs of two liters each ge and he 2016 and a 1000 l reactor was fabricated by using 50 modules that were 20 l each liang et al 2019 potentially increasing the capital cost of the mfc and the complexity of the power conditioning board minimizing the mfc internal resistance has been shown to be the most effective strategy to increase the performance of lab scale mfcs due to the low conductivity of the wastewater reducing the electrode spacing has been shown to decrease the internal resistance of mfcs and increase the reactor performance logan et al 2018 unfortunately reducing the electrode spacing could lead to short circuiting the cell if the electrodes were to touch each other requiring the installation of separators between the electrodes to ensure better electrical insulation further increasing the cost of the materials the mfc internal resistance can be further reduced by diminishing the anode and cathode resistances primarily by reducing the development of ph differences between the electrodes forcing the flow through closely spaced electrodes has recently been shown to greatly improve power generation rossi and logan 2021 rossi et al 2021 although additional considerations must be included to remove particles entering the mfc to minimize clogging based on the results of this study further improvements of mfc technology are needed prior to its transition into use in wastewater treatment facilities future research should focus on improving the throughput and energy production of the technology with the goal of reducing capital costs and reactor footprint by increasing electrode packing densities 4 conclusions the performance of the largest air cathode mfc developed to date was investigated over a six month period using domestic and industrial wastewater the air cathodes avoided the need for aeration of the wastewater that was serially pumped through 17 anode modules 11 m2 connected to 32 cathodes 20 m2 the mfc started producing useful electricity only three days after startup showing a large impact of the availability of wastewater on current and power generation the average power produced over six months was 0 46 0 35 w at an average current of 1 54 0 90 a with a peak of 1 43 w and 2 95 a recorded 81 days after inoculation the anode cathode pairs produced variable current and power depending on the wastewater flow rate and their position in the mfc with the modules in the middle of the reactor producing nearly 4 times more current due to the higher available cathode area and lower oxygen intrusion in the media the mfc removed 49 15 of the cod with a coulombic efficiency of approximately 9 while up to 91 6 of the cod was removed in the combined mfc bf process bod5 ammonia nitrate nitrite tss e coli and fecal coliforms were drastically abated in the mfc with removal up to 90 for chemicals bod5 ammonia and 99 for bacteria in the mfc bf overall technology the combined mfc bf treated domestic wastewater with a minimal energy consumption of only 0 13 wh l which is more than 50 lower than that

16145,microbial fuel cells mfcs can generate electrical energy from the oxidation of the organic matter but they must be demonstrated at large scales treat real wastewaters and show the required performance needed at a site to provide a path forward for this technology previous pilot scale studies of mfc technology have relied on systems with aerated catholytes which limited energy recovery due to the energy consumed by pumping air into the catholyte in the present study we developed deployed and tested an 850 l 1400 l total liquid volume air cathode mfc treating domestic type wastewater at a centralized wastewater treatment facility the wastewater was processed over a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 h through a sequence of 17 brush anode modules 11 m2 total projected anode area and 16 cathode modules each constructed using two air cathodes 0 6 m2 each total cathode area of 20 m2 with the air side facing each other to allow passive air flow the mfc effluent was further treated in a biofilter bf to decrease the organic matter content the field test was conducted for over six months to fully characterize the electrochemical and wastewater treatment performance wastewater quality as well as electrical energy production were routinely monitored the power produced over six months by the mfc averaged 0 46 0 35 w 0 043 w m 2 normalized to the cross sectional area of an anode at a current of 1 54 0 90 a with a coulombic efficiency of 9 approximately 49 15 of the chemical oxygen demand cod was removed in the mfc alone as well as a large amount of the biochemical oxygen demand bod5 70 and total suspended solid tss 48 in the combined mfc bf process up to 91 6 of the cod and 91 of the bod5 were removed as well as certain bacteria e coli 98 9 fecal

produce electrical power logan et al 2019 mfcs have primarily being tested in lab or bench scale reactors often using only synthetic wastewaters characterized by high buffer capacities and substrate concentrations that are not representative of typical domestic wastewaters logan et al 2015 mfcs need to be demonstrated at pilot scale treating real waste streams and showing sufficient performance to provide a path forward for implementation of this technology zhang et al 2013 scaling up mfcs is technically challenging due to the need for a high electrode packing density m2 of electrode per m3 of reactor while increasing reactor capacity to maximize the reactor performance if the electrode specific surface area is not maintained during reactor scale up from lab to pilot scale the volumetric power densities will decrease due to the lack of sufficient electrode specific surface area logan et al 2015 mfcs with low electrode packing densities typically produce low volumetric power due to the large spacing between the electrodes which increases the solution resistance and restricts the performance of the reactor rossi et al 2020 however maintaining a similar electrode packing density during scale up requires cathodes able to withstand high water head pressure in order to avoid flooding of the cathode and the cathode chamber dekker et al 2009 the orr at the cathode uses oxygen to consume electrons generated by the anode thus the orr catalyst needs to be in contact with either dissolved oxygen in liquid media or with air popat and torres 2016 rossi et al 2020 most of the previous mfc pilot scale reactors larger than 250 l have used wastewater aeration rather than direct air cathodes feng et al 2014 liang et al 2018 2019 vilajeliu pons et al 2017 wastewater aeration is undesirable as it currently consumes about half the energy used at a treatment plant and therefore direct air cathodes are preferred to reduce energy demands however as the volume of the reactor and the electrode dimensions are increased the water pressure on the liquid side of the cathode can result in leakage and water flooding of the cathode chamber one of the largest air cathode reactors constructed to date 250 l had horizontal plug flow across two cathodes each 1 m2 separated by 25 cm in order to minimize hydrostatic pressure and prevent water leakage feng et al 2014 the mfc module produced a power density of 0 057 0 001 w m 2 with a cod removal rate of 76 3 the mfc was estimated to reduce energy costs compared to a conventional wastewater treatment by half although expensive precious metal catalysts increased the capital costs of the reactor the pt c cathodes accounted for up to 50 of the overall cost of the mfc a new cathode with no precious metal catalyst and capable of withstanding higher water heights 0 7 m was recently developed hiegemann et al 2019 rossi et al 2019a 2019b the window pane architecture of these cathodes contained panels using activated carbon catalysts with the cathodes welded and glued into a stainless steel frame the cathode was used in mfcs to produce a maximum power density of 0 101 0 006 w m 2 with 0 62 m2 of cathode in a reactor of 85 l 7 3 m2 m 3 which was of the same order of magnitude of the power densities obtained in smaller laboratory scale mfcs fed domestic wastewater 0 31 0 01 w m 2 in a reactor of 28 ml rossi et al 2019 in this study we developed and tested the largest air cathode mfc using primarily domestic wastewater generated at a field site tobyhanna army depot us multi panel cathodes 32 each containing 15 activated carbon cathode panels 0 032 m2 each total active area 15 m2 were welded into metal sheets producing a total cathode surface area of 20 m2 these cathodes were placed into 0 85 m3 of the tank that had a total volume of 1 4 m3 volume including influent and effluent zones achieving a final electrode packing density of 23 m2 m 3 this packing density was comparable to that obtained in much smaller mfcs 25 m2 m 3 logan et al 2015 therefore achieving negligible loss 6 in electrode packing densities with increased reactor size the mfc was integrated into an existing wastewater treatment facility at the site and the effluent of the mfc provided the influent to a biofiltration bf unit ward et al 2015 to further treat the wastewater to meet low effluent cod requirements the combined mfc and bf technologies were designed assembled and integrated into an automated pilot scale wastewater treatment skid that could treat up to 3 79 liters per minute lpm of wastewater the combined treatment system was assessed over a six month period from september 2020 through april 2021 despite having limited personnel at the site due to the covid 19 pandemic over the course of the pilot study the system performance was measured in terms of water quality and energy production and consumption for various relevant modes of operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 construction and operation of the mfc the mfc intuitech utah was a 1400 l including inlet and outlet 850 l active electrolyte occupied by anode and cathode modules pvc tank 2 4 m long by 1 2 m wide by 0 7 m tall fig 1 the wastewater was fed through a manifold to distribute the flow across the height of the module and the wastewater effluent from the mfc was delivered by gravity to the bf unit the mfc contained 17 anode modules supporting information with 40 carbon fiber brush anodes each made using two twisted titanium wires 2 5 cm diameter 61 cm brush length 71 cm overall length the total anode projected area was 11 m2 the brush anodes of each module were electrically connected and wired to the control panel cathodes 1 1 m wide by 0 6 m long 0 62 m2 exposed area 0 48 m2 electroactive area due to the stainless steel frame were purchased from vito belgium mol following a design previously described rossi et al 2019b and assembled in the final cathode module the cathodes were manufactured to be permeable to air on one side 30 diffusion layer porosity and impermeable to water on the other side using a proprietary manufacturing process bouwman et al 2020 each cathode module 16 total 2 cathodes each supporting information was assembled using two air cathodes secured 5 cm apart in the module with the air sides facing each other air chamber and the solution side in contact with the wastewater in the mfc to reduce the cathode deformation due to the pressure of the water on the cathode a support structure that was integral to the side plates of the cathodes was used in the air chamber supporting information the electrode spacing between anode and cathode was 1 2 cm the anode modules closer to the mfc influent and effluent were connected to one cathode each the remaining anode modules 15 were connected to two cathodes one on each side of the brushes the cathodes were wired to the control board and the anode cathode voltage and current were continuously recorded with a multimeter keithley 2700 and 2750 the control board performed maximum power point tracking and allowed continuous measurement of each anode cathode pair performance in terms of current and voltage produced avoided voltage reversal and boosted the final voltage output to either 12 v 18 v or 24 v the design of the pilot scale mfc is described in greater detail in the supporting information the performance of the mfc was continuously evaluated through measurement of the current voltage and power output from each anode cathode pair 32 channels the power and current density were normalized by the cross sectional area of the anode module 0 62 m2 each 11 m2 total or the cathode module 0 62 m2 each 20 m2 total the volumetric power was normalized by the active volume of the mfc 850 l neglecting the inlet and outlet zones as these areas were included to facilitate sampling inspection and troubleshooting during the initial three months of operation voltage and current were monitored with a separate multimeter keithley 2700 voltmeter by connecting each anode module to the two cathodes closest to it through a 4 9 0 6 ω external resistor following the startup and acclimation phase in the initial three months of operation the control board was installed in the control panel allowing a continuous monitoring of the current voltage and power output of the mfc the mfc net energy recovery net was calculated by normalizing the kwh produced over six months by the amount of wastewater treated wh m 3 or cod degraded wh kgcod 1 sampling methods and additional details on the inoculation and operation of the pilot scale mfc bf are described in greater detail in the supporting information 2 2 effluent treatment using the bf after wastewater treatment in the mfc a bf polishing system fig 2 was utilized to provide further reduction of cod and suspended solids the bf system employs high surface area granular activated carbon filtration media that is biologically active allowing for simultaneous physical and biological treatment via adsorption and subsequent biodegradation of both dissolved and particulate contaminants the pilot scale bf unit was composed of a 76 l pvc rectangular tank for feed water two upflow 300 l plexiglass hexagonal tanks 0 33 m2 area by 0 9 m tall filled two thirds of the height with 200 l activated carbon aquacarb 816 evoqua usa and a 76 l pvc rectangular water holding tank for ultrafiltration uf feed followed by a uf module cantel fiberflo hollow fiber cartridge 0 2 micron filter size 7 4 cm outside diameter 51 cm length and a uv device for disinfection aquisense technologies erlanger kentucky usa the bf unit was continuously fed by a suction pump to maintain a design flux of 5 76 lpm m2 while loading the air operated pinch valves were integrated to control the flow path during bf loading and bioregeneration phases 3 results and discussion 3 1 mfc performance the total power produced by the mfc quickly increased during the inoculation stage from 0 01 w to 0 65 w 1 5 a over the initial three days of operation producing an average power density for each module of 0 061 0 008 w m 2 normalized by anode area 11 m2 indicating that the mfc was capable of delivering power in less than a week following inoculation the average power produced over six months was 0 46 0 35 w 0 54 0 41 w m 3 at an average current of 1 54 0 90 a the average power density of the pilot mfc was 0 023 0 017 w m 2 0 077 0 045 a m 2 normalized by cathode surface area 20 m2 and 0 043 0 033 w m 2 0 145 0 085 a m 2 normalized by the anode surface area 11 m2 the mfc maximum power was 1 43 w 1 68 w m 3 at 2 95 a recorded 81 days after inoculation at the maximum power point the power density was 0 135 w m 2 at a current density of 0 278 a m 2 based on the anode surface area or 0 072 w m 2 normalized by cathode area this maximum power density was 34 higher than that obtained with an 85 l mfc 0 101 0 006 w m 2 that used similar materials based on polarization data rossi et al 2019a here two cathodes were connected to one anode compared to only one cathode per anode in the previous study doubling the cathode surface area has been shown to increase power although not directly in proportion to the cathode area for example doubling the cathode area increased the maximum power by 62 in a 0 028 l reactor cheng and logan 2011 39 53 in a 0 1 l mfc kim et al 2015 and by 67 in a 6 1 l mfc he et al 2016 a polarization curve was obtained after 81 days of operation from three modules in the mfc by decreasing the external resistance from 100 ω to 0 5 ω allowing 20 minutes between one resistance and the next to allow the voltage to stabilize the maximum power density was 0 172 0 003 w m 2 with an internal resistance of 1 00 0 04 ω m2 determined from the slope of the polarization curve near the maximum power point supporting information figure s10 the large difference in performance between continuous operation 0 135 w m 2 and the polarization curve 0 172 0 003 w m 2 indicates that the power density was overestimated during the polarization test due to the rapid change in resistances over time 20 minutes which has been proved to be effective in small scale systems but which does not allow large electrodes to fully discharge their capacitive current liang et al 2019 velasquez orta et al 2009 after the initial inoculation stage with fed batch operation wastewater was fed to the mfc at different flow rates producing changes in mfc performance primarily due to variations in the organic content of the wastewater and the rate of wastewater flow into the system fig 3 the low population on the site during nights weekends and holidays did not allow for a stable and continuous feed of wastewater in the mfc which was further complicated by the reduced personnel on site due to covid 19 occupancy restrictions the wastewater flow rate was changed from 1 89 lpm during the day 8 am 3 pm five days a week to 0 76 lpm overnight 3 pm 8 am and completely interrupted 0 lpm during the weekends the lower flow rate overnight decreased the organic loading fed to the mfc diminishing the total power produced by the mfc fig 3 after 80 days of operation the maximum power peaked at 1 30 w at 8 pm decreasing by 35 to 0 84 w at 11 am the following day due to the lower flowrate overnight the lag time between the decrease of the flow rate and the decrease in the performance was likely due to the high hrt of the mfc 12 h at 1 89 lpm and 30 h with 0 76 lpm interrupting the wastewater flow during the weekend further decreased the total power to only 0 03 w before restarting the system the following week the large impact of the flow rate on the performance indicated that the mfc performance was primarily limited by the low organic loading during the weekends at low flow rates and that the mfc power generation can be increased by maintaining a high cod content in the system even though the power decrease at low flow rates was substantial the mfc performance quickly recovered as soon as the wastewater feed was reestablished indicating a high resiliency of the reactor to operational shocks such as low cod concentrations fig 3 the anode cathode pairs produced variable current and power depending on their position in the mfc fig 4 the modules closer to the inlet and outlet produced an average of 46 less power than the modules positioned in the middle of the tank likely due to the larger intrusion of air into the media and to the lower cathode surface area only one cathode was connected to the anode modules next to the influent and effluent manifolds while two cathodes each were used for the remaining anode modules fig 1 after three months of operation the average power density over 9 hours of operation of the module next to the inlet was 0 041 0 001 w m 2 similar to the last module just before the wastewater outlet 0 033 0 002 w m 2 this power density was 73 smaller than that produced by the module in the middle of the mfc 0 152 0 003 w m 2 normalizing the power by the cathode surface area slightly decreases the difference in performance between the end modules and the other modules in the middle of the mfc average 0 077 0 003 w m 2 suggesting that oxygen intrusion can be a factor in limiting the performance of the anodes the average power density of the mfc decreased by 60 after six months of operation from 0 122 0 003 w m 2 total power of 1 3 w to 0 060 0 007 w m 2 total power of 0 6 w part of this decrease was due to cathode fouling for example the performance of an 85 l mfc using a cathode having a design similar to the one used here decreased by 28 after one month of operation primarily due to inorganic and biofouling of the cathode over time rossi et al 2019b some of this degradation in performance over time is due to the formation of a biofilm on the cathode the deposition of salts in the electrocatalytic structure and the adsorption of the organic matter present in the wastewater onto the cathode an et al 2017 in addition the decrease in the average power density for the total reactor was due to failure of water integrity of five cathode modules these modules developed leaks which resulted in flooding of the air chambers producing a large decrease in the performance of those anode cathode modules when the cathode chamber becomes filled with water there is little or no dissolved oxygen in the water and thus current generation is inhibited unless the water is sparged with air vilajeliu pons et al 2017 3 2 microbial community analysis the microbial community on the anode and cathode electrodes was analyzed after eight months of operation fig 5 sulfurimonas and desulfobacter were the most abundant genera on the electrodes of the mfc while the relative abundance of sulfurimonas increased from the influent to the outlet of the reactor desulfobacter followed the opposite trend being most present on the electrodes closer to the influent compared to the effluent desulfobacter is a sulfate reducing bacterium and was likely involved in the reduction of sulfate to sulfide as the wastewater flows through the mfc then due to the presence of the air cathodes and residual dissolved oxygen in solution sulfurimonas took over oxidizing the sulfide produced by desulfobacter this synergistic activity can be observed from the network analysis results indicating a significant p value 0 05 negative correlation between the two operational taxonomic units otus supporting information geobacter trichococcus desulfobacterium paludibacter and thauera showed an unequal distribution between anodes and cathodes geobacter and trichococcus were primarily concentrated on the anode trichococcus have rarely been reported on mfc anodes and typically only when solutions with high concentration of ammonia are fed to the reactor liu et al 2019 geobacter is a well known exoelectrogenic bacteria holmes et al 2004 and its distribution in the pilot mfc followed the same trend of the power density of the different modules fig 4 showing the highest concentration of geobacter in the modules in the middle of the mfc and the lowest in the anode modules closer to the influent and effluent the mfc modules next to the inlet and outlet were open to air in order to facilitate troubleshooting of the mfc and sampling however it has been previously shown that geobacter can tolerate and even utilize small amounts of oxygen to sustain its metabolism lin et al 2004 high dissolved oxygen concentrations however are detrimental to the bacterium suggesting that the oxygen intrusion in the wastewater close to the mfc influent and effluent could have limited its activity and the development of an exoelectrogenic biofilm desulfobacterium and paludibacter have been previously identified on mfc anodes in several studies huang et al 2012 kim et al 2011 li et al 2021 liang et al 2013 wang et al 2019 thauera which selectively colonized the cathode was previously detected in mfc studies more predominantly on the cathode shehab et al 2013 yang et al 2019 2018 zhang et al 2015 members of the genus thauera are known to play a role in denitrification daims et al 2010 and they were previously detected in mfcs operated for nitrogen removal sayess et al 2013 the detection of known genera responsible for nitrification such as nitrosomonas nitrobacter and nitrospira sayess et al 2013 at low relative abundance 0 13 0 16 coupled with the presence of nitrate and nitrite section 3 3 in the mfc reactor and the presence of thauera suggest the possibility of nitrification and denitrification occurring in the mfc reactor the overall microbial community structures collected from anodes and cathodes grew apart with the flow of wastewater i e from inlet to outlet fig 6 the community of anode17 and cathode17 which were located closest to the wastewater inlet had high similarity but diverged greatly with the wastewater flowing to the outlet from the middle to the outlet the electrochemical environment strongly influenced the divergence of microbial communities which were clustered by anode or cathode 3 3 mfc bf wastewater treatment performance a total volume of 110 m3 of wastewater was treated during the six month period of operation of the mfc with an average cod removal of 49 15 in the mfc alone and an overall 91 6 cod removal for the combined mfc bf technology fig 6a the average cod in the mfc influent was 425 114 mg l 1 which was decreased to 220 105 mg l 1 in the mfc effluent and to 36 23 mg l 1 in the bf effluent using the average cod removal in the mfc and the average current produced by the mfc resulted in a coulombic efficiency of approximately 9 the bf effluent was a clear liquid with no appreciable content of dispersed solids supporting information the tss concentration was reduced by 48 17 in the mfc from an average of 123 23 mg l 1 to 61 17 mg l 1 fig 6b the turbidity of the media decreased by 78 in the mfc and by an overall 97 post bf treatment supporting information in line with the decrease of cod and tss the average mfc influent turbidity was 60 ntu while the mfc effluent was 12 ntu and the bf effluent was 1 ntu indicating that most of the solids and particulate dispersed in solution was effectively removed during the mfc bf treatment the concentration of ammonia nitrite and nitrate in the mfc influent mfc effluent and post bf treatment was monitored after the inoculation stage of the mfc and throughout the whole study fig 7 the average ammonia concentration detected in the mfc influent was 33 27 mg l 1 and decreased by around 92 to 2 5 2 mg l 1 in the mfc effluent the ammonia concentration in the bf effluent averaged 0 4 1 mg l 1 previous studies have reported an ammonia removal in mfcs of approximately 60 for single chamber air cathode mfcs jung et al 2008 the ammonia is typically removed in mfcs by volatilization due to the conversion of ammonium ion to the more volatile ammonia species because of an elevated ph near the cathode jung et al 2008 motoyama et al 2021 however we cannot exclude the possibility of nitrification and denitrification occurring in the mfc reactor due to the presence of nitrate and nitrite and known genera responsible for nitrification and denitrification liang et al 2021 motoyama et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 nitrite concentrations decreased after treatment by the mfc from 0 16 0 04 mg l 1 to 0 06 0 02 mg l 1 the average concentration of nitrite in the bf effluent from week 6 to week 13 from startup was 0 03 0 04 mg l 1 and then increased in last few weeks of operation to 0 32 0 27 mg l 1 week 13 19 supporting information the increase in the nitrite concentration in the bf effluent was likely due to nitrification due to the higher loading of wastewater treated by the bf unit in the last weeks of the demonstration the bf was initially bypassed due to frequent clogging of the ultrafiltration unit and overflow in one granular activated carbon tank once these issues were resolved the bf was operated on a daily basis treating the mfc effluent the nitrate concentration followed a trend similar to the nitrite with a 41 decrease in the mfc from 0 78 0 40 mg l 1 to 0 47 0 31 mg l 1 followed by an increase in the bf effluent in the latter weeks of operation 3 1 2 7 mg l 1 from week 13 to week 19 the total nitrogen concentration decreased during the mfc bf treatment from 64 1 mg l 1 in the mfc influent to 29 3 mg l 1 in the mfc effluent and 11 4 mg l 1 post bf treatment indicating that the higher nitrate and nitrite concentrations in the bf effluent were due to nitrification the average sulfide and phosphorus concentrations are reported in the supporting information the quality of the wastewater in the mfc influent mfc effluent and bf effluent was analyzed in terms of bod5 fecal coliforms and e coli concentrations in a one month period collecting two samples per week supporting information the bod5 concentration followed a similar trend to that of the cod with a decrease of 70 in the mfc and of 91 post bf treatment the average influent bod5 was 146 mg l 1 which decreased to 44 mg l 1 in the mfc effluent and 13 mg l 1 in the bf effluent the fecal coliforms and e coli concentration decreased by two orders of magnitude through the mfc fecal coliforms influent 91 000 mpn ml 1 effluent 810 mpn ml 1 e coli influent 72 000 mpn ml 1 effluent 790 mpn ml 1 in the first two weeks of operation the fecal coliforms and e coli concentration in the bf effluent was 610 mpn ml 1 for both the strains the concentration of fecal coliforms and e coli was only 0 075 mpn ml 1 in the first three samples and increased to 24 mpn ml 1 in the last sample it was not clear if the higher content of microorganisms in the latter sample was due to a contamination during sampling or a decrease in the disinfection capability of the bf unit to investigate the impact of the ultrafiltration system on the bf disinfection capacity the uf membrane was removed over the last two weeks of operation and the concentration of fecal coliforms and e coli in the bf effluent was compared with that obtained in the presence of the uf unit the concentration of the fecal coliforms and e coli increased by two orders of magnitude in the absence of the uf unit fecal coliforms 220 mpn ml 1 e coli 180 mpn ml 1 over the last two weeks of operation suggesting that the ultrafiltration was more effective than the uv in reducing the content of microorganisms in the bf effluent at the end of the demonstration stage approximately after six months from the time of inoculation the mass of sludge accumulated in the mfc over the whole demonstration period was measured and analyzed in terms of tss and vss content the total wet weight of sludge was 88 2 kg with a tss of 40 3 g l 1 and a vss of 23 2 g l 1 the volume of wet sludge was approximately 91 l corresponding to a sludge accumulation of 0 9 l per 1000 l of wastewater treated and a sludge production of 0 16 kg tss per kg of cod removed conventional aerobic processes typically generate 0 32 kg tss per kg cod removed ginestet and camacho 2007 therefore 50 less sludge was generated in the mfc compared to conventional treatment 3 4 implications in the development and integration of mfcs in the wastewater treatment infrastructure we developed deployed and evaluated over six months the performance of the largest air cathode mfc ever produced providing data that can help with our insight for achieving practical deployment of bioelectrochemical systems in wastewater treatment plants the reactor startup was relatively fast even under challenging conditions of wastewater availability due to the low flow into the wet well suggesting that these systems could be used for rapid deployment less than 5 of the energy consumed by the pump to deliver the wastewater from the wet well to the mfc was recovered as electrical energy for example after three months of operation the mfc produced 11 4 wh at 1 89 lpm average power of 1 29 0 04 w over 9 h corresponding to only 3 of the energy consumed by the pump 401 wh however the energy generation in the mfc can likely be increased by maintaining a stable flow rate of a high strength wastewater even though the energy recovery and the power generation by the mfc were lower than expected the combined mfc bf technology treated domestic wastewater with a minimal energy consumption of only 0 13 wh l which is more than 75 lower than that of conventional wastewater treatment 0 6 wh l mccarty et al 2011 throughout the demonstration the mfc treated approximately 110 m3 of wastewater producing an average of 18 wh m 3 88 wh kgcod 1 of wastewater treated with peaks of 37 wh m 3 over a week of operation the mfc bf effluent quality met the water quality requirements for discharge from non municipal sewage treatment facilities for most of the parameters investigated ammonia 4 mg l 1 nitrate 10 mg l 1 ph 9 0 tss 30 mg l 1 and organic content 25 mg l 1 were all lower than the average monthly limit for discharge fecal coliforms were reduced below the required limit 20 mpn ml 1 only in the first three weeks of operation and were approximately nine times larger than the maximum limit in the last five samples indicating that higher stability of treatment performance should be achieved to avoid additional steps in the effluent disposal and the associated costs phosphorus concentration in the bf effluent was approximately 15 times larger than the maximum average monthly limit 4 mg l 1 requiring further approaches to manage the concentration of this chemical maintaining power density during system scale up is challenging but as shown here the volume of the reactor can be increased while producing power densities only slightly less than those obtained using smaller systems the pilot scale mfc maximum power density was 0 072 w m 2 based on the overall cathode area 20 m2 and 0 092 w m 2 neglecting the area of the cathode occupied by the stainless steel frame which decreased the electroactive area by 22 this power density is around one third of that previously reported for a 0 028 l cubic mfc 0 31 0 01 w m 2 fed domestic wastewater using the same anode and cathode materials and electrode spacing even though the active volume in the pilot mfc was 30 000 times larger this indicated that the electrode power density could be maintained in pilot scale mfcs if the reactor size was scaled up using reactor configurations similar to lab scale mfcs the power densities of the large air cathode mfc examined here were substantially higher than previous bioelectrochemical systems of similar scales 250 l the maximum power density in a previous study for a 250 l air cathode mfc was 0 057 1 w m 2 about 21 lower than that reported here 0 072 w m 2 and used a precious metal catalyst pt on the cathodes compared to activated carbon used here feng et al 2014 the maximum volumetric power density was 0 46 w m 3 which is less than one third of that obtained here 1 68 w m 3 feng et al 2014 the low volumetric power density was a consequence of the low electrode packing density in that study 8 m2 m 3 compared to 23 m2 m 3 here a maximum power density of only 0 007 w m 2 was reported in another study using a 720 l 6 reactors each of 120 l air cathode mfc das et al 2020 which is one order of magnitude smaller than that obtained here the much lower power density was likely a combination of the use of flat anodes carbon felt which produce lower power than carbon brushes yang et al 2017 and the low electrode packing density of the reactor 1 3 m2 m 3 the air cathode mfc examined here also had improved performance compared to large mfcs using aerated catholytes for example tests using a 1500 l mfc achieved maximum power densities of 0 036 w m 2 dong et al 2019 in one study and 0 029 w m 2 0 40 w m 3 in other tests he et al 2019 using aerated catholytes decreases the energy efficiency of the mfcs due to the need to sparge air in the catholyte high power densities have been reported for other mfcs which were defined as large scale systems based on total system volume but were constructed by combining several small scale systems so the power densities were not obtained for larger reactors babanova et al 2020 blatter et al 2021 ge and he 2016 liang et al 2019 for example a total system volume of 200 l was obtained by connecting 96 mfcs of two liters each ge and he 2016 and a 1000 l reactor was fabricated by using 50 modules that were 20 l each liang et al 2019 potentially increasing the capital cost of the mfc and the complexity of the power conditioning board minimizing the mfc internal resistance has been shown to be the most effective strategy to increase the performance of lab scale mfcs due to the low conductivity of the wastewater reducing the electrode spacing has been shown to decrease the internal resistance of mfcs and increase the reactor performance logan et al 2018 unfortunately reducing the electrode spacing could lead to short circuiting the cell if the electrodes were to touch each other requiring the installation of separators between the electrodes to ensure better electrical insulation further increasing the cost of the materials the mfc internal resistance can be further reduced by diminishing the anode and cathode resistances primarily by reducing the development of ph differences between the electrodes forcing the flow through closely spaced electrodes has recently been shown to greatly improve power generation rossi and logan 2021 rossi et al 2021 although additional considerations must be included to remove particles entering the mfc to minimize clogging based on the results of this study further improvements of mfc technology are needed prior to its transition into use in wastewater treatment facilities future research should focus on improving the throughput and energy production of the technology with the goal of reducing capital costs and reactor footprint by increasing electrode packing densities 4 conclusions the performance of the largest air cathode mfc developed to date was investigated over a six month period using domestic and industrial wastewater the air cathodes avoided the need for aeration of the wastewater that was serially pumped through 17 anode modules 11 m2 connected to 32 cathodes 20 m2 the mfc started producing useful electricity only three days after startup showing a large impact of the availability of wastewater on current and power generation the average power produced over six months was 0 46 0 35 w at an average current of 1 54 0 90 a with a peak of 1 43 w and 2 95 a recorded 81 days after inoculation the anode cathode pairs produced variable current and power depending on the wastewater flow rate and their position in the mfc with the modules in the middle of the reactor producing nearly 4 times more current due to the higher available cathode area and lower oxygen intrusion in the media the mfc removed 49 15 of the cod with a coulombic efficiency of approximately 9 while up to 91 6 of the cod was removed in the combined mfc bf process bod5 ammonia nitrate nitrite tss e coli and fecal coliforms were drastically abated in the mfc with removal up to 90 for chemicals bod5 ammonia and 99 for bacteria in the mfc bf overall technology the combined mfc bf treated domestic wastewater with a minimal energy consumption of only 0 13 wh l which is more than 50 lower than that of conventional wastewater treatment the pilot study presented here provides a path forward for the mfc technology showing that mfcs can be effectively integrated into the existing wastewater

16146,this study presents a nation wide assessment of the influence of chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing cpm wastewaters on synthetic organic contaminant soc emissions to swiss surface waters geographic information system gis based analysis of the presence of cpm in wastewater treatment plant wwtp catchments revealed wide distribution of this industrial sector across switzerland suggesting that one third of the 718 swiss wwtps may be influenced by cpm wastewaters to reflect the diversity of this type of wastewaters we investigated the effluents of 11 wwtps of diverse sizes and technologies which treated 0 100 wastewater from a variety of cpm activities in an extensive sampling campaign we collected temporally high resolved i e daily samples for 2 3 months to capture the dynamics of cpm discharges the 850 samples were then measured with liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms non target characterization of the lc hrms time series datasets revealed that cpm wastewaters left a highly variable and site specific signature in the effluents of the wwtps particularly compared to wwtps with purely domestic input a larger variety of substances up to 15 times more compounds with higher maximum concentrations 1 2 orders of magnitude and more uncommon substances were found in cpm influenced effluents moreover in the latter highly fluctuating discharges often contributed to a substantial fraction of the overall emissions the largely varying characteristics of cpm discharges between different facilities were primarily related to the type of activities at the industries i e production versus processing of chemicals as well as to the pre treatment and storage of cpm wastewaters eventually for one wwtp lc hrms time series were correlated with ecotoxicity time series obtained from bioassays and major toxic components could be identified overall in view of their potential relevance to water quality a strong focus on soc discharges from cpm is essential including the design of situation specific monitoring as well as risk assessment and mitigation strategies that consider the variability of industrial emissions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micropollutants industrial wastewater chemical and pharmaceutical industry high resolution mass spectrometry non target analysis temporal data 1 introduction wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents are a major source of synthetic organic contaminants socs to the aquatic environment there is evidence that in addition to domestic wastewater wastewaters from chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing cpm can contribute substantially to the loads of socs emitted to surface waters anliker et al 2020a anliker et al 2020b cardoso et al 2014 kleywegt et al 2019 larsson 2014 schlusener et al 2015 scott et al 2018 however to date most studies on cpm emissions in wwtp effluents including our own anliker et al 2020a anliker et al 2020b investigated the wastewaters of individual industries or industrial sites hence it is currently unclear whether soc emissions from cpm are isolated events or widespread to the best of our knowledge there are only two studies both focusing on pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in north america kleywegt et al 2019 scott et al 2018 that have assessed cpm discharges from different locations based on large sets of 100 target compounds it was clearly shown that the wastewaters of every company emitted substantially higher pharmaceutical loads than those detected in domestic wastewaters however these studies focused on target compounds in individual grab samples and therefore do not fully reflect the complexity and dynamics of cpm wastewaters indeed the temporal and compositional dynamics of cpm discharges overall have been rarely investigated to date the available studies have shown that cpm discharges strongly vary over time and that long term and high temporal resolution sampling is essential to capture production cycle dependent cpm emissions and related peak concentrations anliker et al 2020a anliker et al 2020b ruppe et al 2018 schlusener et al 2015 for a thorough chemical characterization of such complex samples high resolution mass spectrometry hrms has been established as the method of choice as it provides comprehensive information on both known and unknown compounds and hence does not rely on prior knowledge of the sample composition e g comprehensive production data which is commonly very difficult to obtain for cpm cardoso et al 2014 phillips et al 2010 moreover recently the analysis of entire datasets of unidentified lc hrms signals chemical fingerprints has increasingly been applied for the characterization and differentiation of various emissions sources of socs often in combination with time trend or spatial analysis anliker et al 2020a beckers et al 2020 chiaia hernandez et al 2017 du et al 2020 schollée et al 2021 without identifying specific compounds these non target investigations of hrms datasets are extremely valuable for a better understanding of soc sources in general however chemical characterization alone does not provide information about the ecotoxicological relevance of the detected hrms signals to evaluate the potential impacts of the wwtp effluents on aquatic communities lc hrms data eventually need to be related to toxicological effects brack et al 2018 yet time resolved toxicological evaluations are time consuming costly and therefore rare the goal of this study was to characterize soc discharges from cpm via wwtps on a national scale and to evaluate their relevance as soc source affecting surface water quality in comparison to domestic wastewaters specifically we were interested in i investigating the occurrence and spatial distribution of cpm discharges in switzerland ii describing their influence on effluent chemical composition and dynamics and iii providing a first assessment of potential factors that influence the extent and the characteristics of soc emissions from cpm in wwtp effluents finally we aimed to exemplarily link comprehensive temporal hrms data with temporal toxicity data to identify the cause of adverse effects observed in cpm wastewater to achieve these goals we extended our previous investigations of soc discharges from pharmaceutical manufacturing anliker et al 2020a anliker et al 2020b to a much larger set of wwtps including ones that receive substantial shares of wastewater from chemical facilities in a first step swiss wwtp catchments were analyzed systematically for the presence of cpm using geographic information system gis analysis and structural business statistics data based on this analysis seven wwtps were selected as sampling sites each receiving various shares of wastewater from diverse cpm facilities for 2 3 months daily effluent samples were taken at each wwtp and analyzed with lc hrms we then compared the time series datasets of the seven wwtps measured for the current study along with previously acquired data of four additional wwtps anliker et al 2020a anliker et al 2020b using a non target approach rather than on structure elucidation the analysis focused on general characteristics of the hrms time series inventories such as the number of compounds that persisted during wastewater treatment intensity variations over time and maximal intensities eventually due to the commitment of one of the connected industries comprehensive bioassays were performed at one wwtp in parallel to our lc hrms based monitoring for this wwtp lc hrms time series were correlated with ecotoxicity time series to find toxicity causing components based on matching time patterns as far as we are aware the current study is the first attempt to assess the relevance of soc discharges from cpm on a national level using comprehensive temporal lc hrms data 2 materials and methods 2 1 geospatial data analysis to assess the cpm industrial density per wwtp catchment geospatial data analysis was performed with the open source geographic information system software qgis version 3 10 qgis development team 2020 the swiss business statistics dataset swiss federal statistical office 2016 was filtered for entries of chemical and pharmaceutical industries i e for general classification of economic activities noga swiss federal office 2021b divisions 20 manufacture of chemicals and chemical products and 21 manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations the spatial resolution of the business statistics data was one hectare and values 3 were set to 3 in the original dataset to prevent the identification of individual industries the number of full time equivalent employees and the number of workplaces i e facilities within the chemical and pharmaceutical sector extracted from the business statistics was then intersected with the wwtp catchment areas eawag 2014 additionally for the visualization fig 1 the following basic swiss geospatial data were used national boundaries swisstopo 2015 lake shorelines swisstopo 2007 and the water network swiss federal office for the environment 2015 2 2 sampling site description this study analyzed the effluents of 11 wwtps of different sizes and technologies across switzerland which treated differing shares of cpm wastewater 0 100 see supplementary information si 1 for the sampling site selection criteria the effluents of seven wwtps were sampled for the present study and samples from four wwtps have been taken previously anliker et al 2020a anliker et al 2020b eight of the investigated wwtps receive both domestic and industrial wastewater one exclusively treats cpm wastewater and for comparison two only treat domestic wastewater this selection is representative of the situation in switzerland where the vast majority of cpm sites discharge their wastewater to municipal wwtps summary information on the 11 wwtps considered in this study are given in table 1 because the sampling at all wwtps was conducted under non disclosure agreements the locations of the wwtps and the names of the companies have been anonymized similarly the names of the compounds reported to be processed by industry have been removed hereafter the wwtps receiving cpm wastewater are referred to as cp and cpf with cpf referring specifically to wwtps that receive wastewater only from formulating and not producing cpm activities indicating the volume in percent industrial wastewater and the purely domestic wwtps are referred to as d01 and d02 the absolute volume of industrial wastewater treated varied between 50 and 9 600 m3 d for the wwtps with cpm in their catchments in this context it is important to notice that a small amount of industrial wastewater can already contribute substantially to the total influent doc see table 1 the purely industrial wwtp cp100 represents an exception insofar as it has much lower capacity than all other wwtps and is equipped with an advanced treatment specifically for soc removal i e activated carbon adsorption the other wwtps receive mixed influents and have only mechanical and conventional biological treatment steps which are in some cases complemented with phosphorous removal nitrification and denitrification these mostly biology based treatments will remain standard at most municipal swiss wwtps also in the foreseeable future as only selected 100 out of 718 wwtps will be upgraded with an additional treatment for soc removal swiss federal office 2021a biological treatment options are also the standard in other counties worldwide that have central wastewater treatment in terms of connected industries it should be noted that at four wwtps the cpm wastewater originates from a single company whereas at five it stems from several companies so called cpm clusters the in total 23 facilities covered by the study include producing chemical industries that synthesize plant protection products and base chemicals as well as producing and formulating i e facilities that process active pharmaceutical ingredients into medical end products pharmaceutical industries several companies are involved in research and development activities and for the majority of the companies on demand custom synthesis is an important part of their business activities there are wwtp catchments with a relatively low number of 101 500 employees in cpm as well as two catchments with 2 000 employees while this might not be the case everywhere kleywegt et al 2019 in switzerland cpm wastewater is generally pretreated on site before its collection in large buffer tanks from where it is then directed to a wwtp straub et al 2020 all the cpm companies covered in this study incinerate their most contaminated wastewaters based on information provided by companies connected to cp60 and cp100 the volume of incinerated wastewater amounts to 20 000 m3 and 10 000 m3 per year respectively apart from incinerating the most problematic wastewaters the level of on site wastewater pretreatment differed substantially among the companies it ranged from simple neutralization to highly specific treatment of individual wastewater streams using e g distillation chemical oxidation or activated carbon adsorption in some cases detailed information on pretreatment and on site wastewater handling was difficult to obtain and is therefore missing in table 1 while each constituting a specific case we think that together the sampling sites included in this study do reflect the variety of cpm wastewater in switzerland and are therefore suitable to describe soc discharges from this industrial sector on a national scale 2 3 chemicals and solutions information on the chemicals and solutions used for chemical analysis is provided in the si 2 2 4 sample collection and storage wwtp effluents were sampled to determine the socs released to surface waters to take into account the dynamics of cpm emissions and to increase the probability of capturing short term discharges highly resolved temporal sampling was performed for several months at cp1 0 and cp25 sampling was conducted for 2 months from early september until end of october 2017 56 samples per sampling site at d02 cp1 7 cp50 cp60 and cp100 the sampling campaign lasted for 3 months from end of october 2017 until end of january 2018 91 samples per sampling site daily 24 h composite samples were collected by the staff of the wwtps using the available on site infrastructure each day a sample aliquot of 50 ml was filled in a 100 ml glass bottle and stored at 4 c at the end of each week samples were shipped on ice to the laboratory and stored at 20 c until chemical analysis maximum six months after the end of the sampling campaign 2 5 sample preparation samples were prepared and analyzed in one batch per wwtp after thawing 5 ml of each sample were centrifuged megafuge 1 0 r heraeus sepatech at a relative centrifugal force of 3 g at 25 c for 15 min in glass vials to remove suspended particles then 1 5 ml supernatant were transferred to 2 ml glass measurement vials and spiked with 15 μl of a solution containing 235 isotope labeled internal standards istds si 3 table s1 the concentration of each istd was 1 µg l for the cp1 0 and cp25 samples and 2 µg l for all other wwtps see si 5 for details for the cp1 0 and cp25 samples a ten point calibration ranging from 0 005 to 10 µg l with a mix of 659 compounds si 4 table s2 including 114 compounds known to be manufactured at one of the cpm sites considered in this study was prepared in ultrapure water for all other wwtps a seven point calibration from 0 025 to 10 µg l was used in the following compounds for which an authentic reference standard was available and analyzed are referred to as target compounds during sample preparation for each sampling site four samples were spiked with the target compounds two samples each at a concentration of 0 1 and 1 µg l to assess recoveries additionally duplicates were prepared for three samples of each wwtp and measured for quality control finally laboratory method blank samples were included in the measurement to determine contamination and carry over 2 6 lc hrms measurements the wwtp effluent samples were analyzed by large volume direct injection lc hrms the samples of the different wwtps were measured in separate sequences to ensure the quality of the measurements the analytical instrument was cleaned and calibrated before each sequence in each sequence after every tenth wwtp sample a blank ultrapure water without and a blank with istds was analyzed the calibration curve was measured at the beginning and at the end of each sequence a sample volume of 50 μl was injected and separated with a mobile phase gradient water methanol both acidified with 0 1 formic acid on a reversed phase c18 column atlantis t3 3 μm particle size 3 0 150 mm inner diameter waters at a flow rate of 300 µl min hrms data was acquired on a hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer qexactive plus thermo scientific in positive and negative electrospray ionization esi mode in separate runs full scan spectra of two mass ranges i e 50 105 m z and 100 1000 m z were recorded at a resolution r of 35 000 and 140 000 at m z 200 respectively these full scans were followed by six data independent ms ms experiments r 17 500 at m z 200 because of the large differences in sample matrix slight adaptions to the method between sample measurements of different wwtps were necessary these are detailed in si 5 further details on the analytical instrumentation and the method are provided elsewhere anliker et al 2020b based on the istds and the quantified target compounds measurements generally resulted in mass errors 2 ppm and retention time rt deviations 30 sec measurement quality control data is presented in si 6 although the focus of this work is on socs the generic analytical method used may also have captured natural organic compounds and a few inorganics 2 7 lc hrms data processing and data analysis the lc hrms non target data processing closely followed the procedure described in anliker et al 2020a here the envimass workflow version 4 3 loos 2021 was used for the automatic generation of intensity time series of all lc hrms full scan features i e chromatographic peaks defined by m z and rt detected in the mass range of 100 1000 m z the data of each wwtp were processed in a separate batch the processing steps and settings of the envimass workflow are given in si 7 and si 8 respectively and details on the extraction of time series and subsequent filtering for relevant entries are described in anliker et al 2020a importantly only signals of an intensity 1e5 and time series with an average sample blank ratio 10 were considered in the analysis since componentization was performed i e features of adduct and isotopologues belonging to the same component were grouped and only the most intense entry was retained it was assumed that each feature in the final datasets corresponds to one compound selected target compounds were quantified with the software tracefinder 4 1 thermo scientific quantification was based on the area ratio of the reference standard and the istd of the analyte compounds were considered quantifiable if the relative recovery based on spiked samples and the reproducibility based on replicate samples was in a range of 75 to 125 overall the lc hrms data of 853 effluent samples were analyzed in this study between 56 and 91 for each of the 11 wwtps as mentioned above the data of the daily wwtp effluents samples from d01 and cp3 0 3 months observation period and cpf0 1 and cpf2 3 2 months observation period were acquired in the framework of previous studies these data were acquired and processed using a very similar approach to the one described here details are given in anliker et al 2020a for d01 and cp3 0 and in anliker et al 2020b for cpf0 1 and cpf2 3 data analysis was performed using the statistical software r version 3 6 1 r core team 2017 with the basic functions if not stated otherwise for quantification of the overall intensity variation the fold change observed in hrms time series was calculated as the ratio of the 0 95 quantile to the 0 05 quantile of the intensity values according to anliker et al 2020a as proposed previously anliker et al 2020a a threshold for overall time series variation 10 fold was used to detect potential cpm emissions assuming that large fluctuations were linked to production cycles a mass window tolerance of 2ppm and a rt tolerance of 30s was applied to define matching feature pairs between different wwtps for the correlation analysis non detects in the lc hrms data were set to zero spearman s rank order correlation coefficients ρ between hrms time series and toxicity time series were calculated using the r cor test function 2 8 bioassays a comprehensive ecotoxicological study with the effluents of cp60 was performed by a private laboratory soluval santiago couvet switzerland on behalf of one of the companies connected to the wwtp for this simultaneously to the lc hrms sample collection daily 24 h composite effluent samples were taken in vivo bioassays were then conducted for the 91 samples according to iso standards in screening mode i e at a reduced number of concentrations and replicates acute toxicity tests were performed for microcrustaceans daphnia magna endpoint immobilization and mortality duration 48 h iso 6341 bacteria microtoxtm vibrio fischeri bioluminescence 0 5 h iso 11348 3 as well as chronic toxicity tests with green algae raphidocelis subcapitata growth 72 h iso 8692 and macrophytes lemna minor population growth 7 d iso 20079 the results of the ecotoxicological assessment were expressed in toxic units see si 9 for details however as requested by the company that provided the data all toxicity data are given as normalized values only a fixed value was used for results below the sensitivity limit of the bioassays see si 9 in this work the toxicity time series were correlated with the lc hrms time series of cp60 thereby obtaining a virtual fractionation to identify features that potentially cause the observed ecotoxicological effects see section 2 7 similar approaches based on multivariate variate data analysis instead of time series have successfully been applied previously eide et al 2004 eide et al 2002 hug et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 presence of chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in swiss wwtp catchments according to the statistical records swiss federal statistical office 2016 there is relative to the country s small area of 41 300 km2 a considerable number of 1 000 industrial premises in the chemical 727 and pharmaceutical 279 sector registered the gis based analysis showed that chemical and pharmaceutical industries are located in 271 38 of the 718 swiss wwtp catchments the number of full time equivalent employees per catchment as a proxy for cpm industrial density is illustrated in the map in fig 1 discussions with the respective cantonal authorities revealed that a high number of full time employees in cpm industries was for most catchments a good indicator for identifying wwtps that treat substantial amounts of cpm wastewater in a few cases only it was found that cpm locations are purely administrative or the respective companies do not discharge any manufacturing wastewater as this was the case for wwtp d01 for instance table 1 in the majority of the wwtp catchments with cpm 172 of 271 there are 100 employees in the respective industry branch the analysis identified only four catchments with more than 2000 full time employees in the cpm sector these findings indicate that many wwtps in the swiss plateau potentially receive wastewater from cpm mostly from small to middle sized facilities hence contamination from cpm is potentially widespread nationwide and focusing on the well known cpm hotspots might miss important contributions it can be assumed that the situation is similar in other regions of the world where cpm locations are far more numerous than in switzerland e g 30 000 all over europe european chemical industry council 2020 25 000 in the us the international trade administration 2021 and 20 000 in china chen and reniers 2020 to the best of our knowledge systematic assessments of cpm emissions in these countries are missing and an analysis as the one presented here could provide valuable first insights into the prevalence of potential cpm contamination 3 2 characteristics of temporal lc hrms signatures in wwtp effluents next we were interested if the presence of cpm in the wastewater wwtp catchment has an actual impact on the effluents to this end we analyzed the effluent data of the 11 wwtps data processing resulted in a time series for each of the several thousand features detected in the lc hrms measurements of the effluent samples ranging from 4 542 cpf0 1 to 69 480 cp50 per wwtp fig 2 a first we characterized the time series datasets with a non target approach and then compared them considering the different contributions of cpm wastewater at each wwtp in the interest of clarity the data of the esi positive and negative mode measurements are discussed together 3 2 1 comparison of purely domestic and cpm wastewater receiving wwtp effluents starting with a general comparison of purely domestic and cpm influenced wwtp effluents clear differences were already apparent at the level of doc concentrations which were generally higher and fluctuated more at wwtps receiving cpm wastewater si 10 however doc measurements do not provide information on the composition of the effluents the lc hrms time series datasets revealed that compared to purely domestic wwtp effluents up to 15 times more features were detected in cpm wastewater receiving wwtp effluents fig 2 a suggesting that a larger substance spectrum was emitted in the latter furthermore the share of features with very high intensities i e 1e8 was larger at the wwtps that receive cpm wastewater ranging up to 7 compared to d01 and d02 with a share 1 si 11 figure s3 even though feature intensities cannot be directly transferred into concentrations because of different ionization efficiencies of the underlying compounds high intensities still often correspond to high concentrations hence the results imply that more compounds with very high concentrations were discharged in the effluents of wwtps receiving cpm wastewater compared to purely domestic ones we then focused on features with intensity variations 10 fold in their time series in the following referred to as highly fluctuating features i e potential industrial emissions see section 2 7 here the percentage of highly fluctuating features varied between 2 6 d01 and 16 7 cp50 fig 2 a black bars the number of highly fluctuating features was generally larger at wwtps that treat cpm wastewater and features with extreme variations i e 1 000 fold were only detected at these wwtps si 11 overall these general differences between purely domestic and wwtps receiving cpm wastewater were consistent with the findings of our previous work anliker et al 2020a which was based on comparing d01 and cp3 0 only given the large share of cpm wastewater in some of the wwtps the percentages of highly fluctuating features might seem relatively small however highly fluctuating features accounted for a much larger proportion 40 of the total measured intensity at the majority of the wwtps receiving cpm wastewater compared to purely domestic wwtps 20 fig 2 b this implies that highly fluctuating features most likely indicative of industrial discharges contributed considerably to total substance emissions the temporal patterns of the share of highly fluctuating features relative to the total intensity is provided in si 12 overall the comparison of the non target time series datasets of purely domestic and cpm influenced wwtp effluents indicated that substantial emissions in terms of both substance diversity and magnitude from cpm are rather the rule than the exception this conclusion is in accordance with the two other large scale studies on soc discharges from cpm both of which concluded that pharmaceutical manufacturing wastewaters were generally a relevant source of pharmaceuticals to the aquatic environment kleywegt et al 2019 scott et al 2018 in the future as a consequence of the current covid pandemic cpm activities are expected to increase in switzerland and the eu due to recent initiatives to bring back pharmaceutical production to europe to reduce the risk of medicine shortages european commission 2020 at the international level based on available literature larsson et al 2007 li et al 2008 it can be assumed that contamination from cpm is even more relevant in regions of the world with much higher production volumes and less focus on surface water quality therefore in many parts or the world cpm is likely a currently underestimated source of socs influencing water quality 3 2 2 differences between the effluents of cpm wastewater receiving wwtps as described in the section above cpm influenced wwtps were generally observed to have a large number of total features a large portion of intense features and a large proportion of highly fluctuating features however these characteristics did not correlate well to other factors such as the percentage of industrial wastewater the number of employees or the doc concentration a comprehensive analysis of the factors affecting cpm emissions was not possible due to missing information on industrial processes wastewater handling and pre treatment nevertheless a closer inspection of specific cases did reveal potential explanations for the differences observed among the cpm influenced wwtps first there seems to be a difference between producing and formulating facilities this difference might originate from the fact that formulating industries commonly emit fewer compounds for example during our sampling campaign at wwtp cpf0 1 and cpf2 3 only 77 different compounds were processed by the five companies involved in the study anliker et al 2020b compared to hundreds of compounds expected from synthesis activities including starting materials end products catalysts solvents intermediates and byproducts howard and muir 2013 apart from their small shares of cpm wastewater this might explain why at cpf0 1 and cpf2 3 highly fluctuating emissions contributed comparatively little 20 to the overall intensity fig 2 b still active pharmaceutical ingredients processed by formulating industries were responsible for the highest peak concentrations measured in the effluents of both wwtps anliker et al 2020b second as expected the extent to which cpm discharges are detected in wwtps effluents seems to largely depend on the wastewater pre treatment on the one hand cp1 7 and cp3 0 where highly fluctuating features contributed disproportionately 50 despite industrial wastewater shares 5 vol to the total intensities fig 2 b are known to have insufficient pretreatment and requirements for mitigation measures have been imposed on the respective companies on the other hand activated carbon adsorption is in place at two wwtps as an on site advanced pretreatment prior to release to cp1 0 and as final wwtp treatment step at cp100 at both wwtps relatively few features and smaller proportions of highly fluctuating emissions were detected fig 2 a however at cp100 the daily share of highly fluctuating features on the total emissions varied substantially fig 2 b when considering the time pattern of the total intensities at cp100 si 12 figure s4 k it becomes apparent that this variation was caused by one event of very high cumulative intensities also reflected in increased doc concentrations this event was attributable to a malfunction of the wwtp highlighting that a correctly operating treatment is fundamental to prevent emissions and that the fluctuating emissions observed at cp100 were in contrast to our initial assumption not per se caused by production cycles third industrial wastewater storage and discharge practices appear to strongly influence the dynamics of cpm discharges observed in wwtp effluents in particular at cp25 cpm wastewater is collected in large stacking tanks and released little by little into the wwtp this controlled discharge likely averages out production dependent fluctuations and might explain why relatively few highly fluctuating features were detected in the effluents of cp25 hence as has been highlighted previously anliker et al 2020b kleywegt et al 2019 for data interpretation knowledge on the production cycles and the companies wastewater handling is essential in some cases focusing on highly fluctuating features might be misleading and will miss relevant cpm discharges therefore considering additional indicators for industrial emissions might be necessary such as site specificity of features or much higher intensities of relatively constant features compared to other sites krauss et al 2019 3 3 comparison of the composition of wwtp effluents so far the focus was on the overall feature characteristics of the investigated wwtp effluents next we compared the composition of the effluents with a focus on the top most intense features assuming that those are the most relevant from a concentration point of view first we investigated the overlap of features between the different wwtps specifically we extracted the 100 most intense features at each wwtp and analyzed the percentage of matching features i e same m z and rt the results are displayed as overlap matrices in fig 3 generally more overlapping features were found between the effluents of wwtps that are less influenced by cpm wastewater i e up to 35 d02 and cpf2 3 in positive and up to 49 cpf0 1 and cp1 0 in negative esi mode in contrast the wwtps that receive 25 vol cpm wastewater had maximally 7 overlapping features with any other wwtp in esi positive mode and 18 in esi negative mode respectively this result indicates that compounds with highest concentrations in domestic wastewater are rather similar between different wwtps while they are site specific in the cpm wastewater influenced effluents we then looked for target compounds i e known substances for which reference standards were available and analyzed among the overlapping features it was found that compounds detected at more than two wwtps were substances known to be present at high concentrations in domestic wastewater effluents benzotriazole detected among the most intense features at 8 wwtps 4 5 methylbenzotriazole 6 metformin 5 4 acetamidoantipyrine 5 tramadol and o desvenlafaxine isobaric co eluting 5 gabapentin 5 n n diethyl 3 methylbenzamide deet 4 and irbesartan 3 in positive esi and the artificial sweeteners acesulfame 7 and saccharine 4 in negative esi mode however these well known domestic wastewater contaminants only rarely appeared among the 100 most intense features at wwtps strongly influenced by cpm wastewater generally the 100 most intense features of these wwtps only contained few target compounds anyhow and the ones found were typically reported i e either confidentially by the company or on a publicly available product list to be manufactured by a cpm company in the catchment of the respective wwtp these cpm target compounds were usually not measured in domestic wastewater or at much lower concentrations i e 1 2 orders of magnitude si 13 table s4 thus supporting our previous results from a smaller set of wwtps anliker et al 2020a anliker et al 2020b in summary each cpm site displays its very own substance spectrum and relevant compounds are hence site specific searching for features of high intensity variations in lc hrms time series anliker et al 2020a proved efficient in most cases to detect potential cpm discharges and thus can be applied in other regions of the world to obtain an initial estimate of the extent of such emissions however compound specific monitoring and sound environmental risk assessments of cpm discharges remain very challenging since each situation has to be assessed individually 3 4 identifying lc hrms features causing toxicity in the following we discuss the results of correlating the toxicity data with the lc hrms chemical data while no significant toxicity was observed in the acute toxicity assays with microcrustaceans and luminescent bacteria distinct time periods of substantial effects occurred in the chronic tests with green algae and macrophytes for the green algae significant toxicity was observed in the effluent samples during the last 20 days of the sampling campaign correlation of the hrms data with the algae toxicity data resulted in only one feature with a highly correlated time series i e spearman s ρ 0 9 fig 4 a the chemical structure of the measured m z 112 9857 deprotonated molecular ion was identified and confirmed with a reference standard as trifluoracetic acid tfa level 1 identification schymanski et al 2014 the maximum effluent concentration was estimated retrospectively based on a one point calibration and amounted to approximately 10 mg l although tfa is widely used in organic synthesis intensive follow up investigations of the concerned company showed that in this case tfa was formed during a specific waste stream pre treatment changing the pre treatment process substantially reduced the effluent toxicity importantly this example demonstrates that unidentified compounds in cpm wastewater might be responsible for considerable toxicity and as a consequence that risk assessments focusing only on active ingredients are insufficient for the macrophytes duckweed increased toxicity was observed during two short periods of 3 and 1 days the time series of three hrms features that were very well correlated with the macrophytes toxicity could be associated through different adducts indicating that feature componentization was not always successful to a herbicide herb a produced by a company connected to cp60 in fig 4 b the data of the most intense adduct m h is shown the other time series are given in si 14 figures s5 m and n indeed duckweed is well known to be sensitive to herb a epa 2020 while tfa corresponded to the 10th most intense feature i e according to maximum intensity during the sampling period in negative esi the most intense adduct of herb a was on rank 1204 only in positive esi demonstrating that also less intense features might be ecotoxicologically relevant herb a was on the confidential product list provided by the company and was included in our measurements as cpm target compound i e an authentic reference standard was measured leading to level 1 identification schymanski et al 2014 quantification resulted in a maximal effluent concentration of 9 3 µg l considering the complex composition of the effluents it is surprising that in both algae and macrophytes toxicity only one single compound was found to be responsible for the observed effects only for the macrophytes toxicity additional hrms features resulted in very high correlation coefficients si 14 figure s5 however none of them explained both periods of increased toxicity moreover some of the observed high correlations were rather uncertain because intensities of the corresponding hrms features were close to the limit of detection lod and or few data points were detected yet experiments with the individual substances showed increased toxicity by 170 and 140 for herb a and tfa respectively in non toxic cp60 effluent 7 day composite sample compared to standard test medium epa aap epa 1996 this observation suggests that the sample matrix can influence observed compound toxicity this might be due to synergistic effects with matrix components or enhanced bioavailability in the effluent samples in summary combining temporal hrms chemical data with temporal toxicity data proved highly successful in identifying compounds in cpm wastewaters that were toxic in in vivo bioassays fundamental to the success of time series correlation was the availability of high temporally resolved data reflecting daily fluctuations and short term peaks as well as the presence of distinct time patterns in these data 4 conclusions long term daily lc hrms effluent signatures of 11 swiss wwtps receiving 0 100 vol of cpm wastewater were acquired and analyzed in this study using mainly a non target approach this unique dataset enabled assessing the complexity diversity and contaminant dynamics of cpm discharges via wwtp effluents for the first time on a national level the results showed that cpm is surprisingly widely distributed across switzerland and 30 of the municipal wwtps potentially receive cpm wastewater suggesting that also in other countries cpm discharges might be a more widespread source of soc contamination than anticipated substantial soc emissions from cpm have to be expected unless i the share of industrial wastewater on the total wwtp flow is very low 5 ii a highly advanced wastewater pre treatment is in place and iii the number of compounds handled on site is small effluents mainly dominated by households exhibited relatively constant temporal dynamics and their composition was similar among different wwtps whereas cpm influenced effluents generally showed higher complexity variability and site specificity in some cases even small amounts of cpm wastewater 5 caused significant changes in the effluent composition compared to emissions in domestic wastewaters amounts of socs discharged in cpm wastewater may be very high i e up to 15 times more compounds and 1 2 orders of magnitude higher signal intensities indicating higher concentrations were observed because of the diversity of this industrial branch there are large differences in the dynamics and compositions between the effluents of cpm influenced wwtps compounds relevant for monitoring differ from facility to facility and often include non registered chemicals hence the strategies currently applied to monitor soc emissions in domestic wwtp effluents by performing sporadic measurements of a predefined set of target compounds are not suitable to assess cpm discharges rather the site specificity of cpm discharges requires considering the individual situation to achieve sound risk assessments and to define suitable monitoring programs and mitigation measures combining temporal hrms data and temporal toxicity data was highly successful to identify toxicity causing compounds in cpm wastewater and indicated that unknown unexpected and low abundant compounds may be ecotoxicologically relevant overall we conclude that in countries where cpm is present soc contamination from this industrial source is likely an underestimated factor influencing the quality of surface waters applying multiple mitigation strategies is essential to reduce the potential environmental impact of cpm wastewaters including reducing soc load and complexity as well as removing the most toxic compounds in the future innovative technical solutions are needed as an alternative to wastewater incineration which is very energy inefficient finally further studies are required to contribute to a better awareness of soc discharges from cpm and to increase the companies commitment to put their principles of environmental sustainability more rigorously into action in fact at cpm

16146,this study presents a nation wide assessment of the influence of chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing cpm wastewaters on synthetic organic contaminant soc emissions to swiss surface waters geographic information system gis based analysis of the presence of cpm in wastewater treatment plant wwtp catchments revealed wide distribution of this industrial sector across switzerland suggesting that one third of the 718 swiss wwtps may be influenced by cpm wastewaters to reflect the diversity of this type of wastewaters we investigated the effluents of 11 wwtps of diverse sizes and technologies which treated 0 100 wastewater from a variety of cpm activities in an extensive sampling campaign we collected temporally high resolved i e daily samples for 2 3 months to capture the dynamics of cpm discharges the 850 samples were then measured with liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms non target characterization of the lc hrms time series datasets revealed that cpm wastewaters left a highly variable and site specific signature in the effluents of the wwtps particularly compared to wwtps with purely domestic input a larger variety of substances up to 15 times more compounds with higher maximum concentrations 1 2 orders of magnitude and more uncommon substances were found in cpm influenced effluents moreover in the latter highly fluctuating discharges often contributed to a substantial fraction of the overall emissions the largely varying characteristics of cpm discharges between different facilities were primarily related to the type of activities at the industries i e production versus processing of chemicals as well as to the pre treatment and storage of cpm wastewaters eventually for one wwtp lc hrms time series were correlated with ecotoxicity time series obtained from bioassays and major toxic components could be identified overall in view of their potential relevance to water quality a strong focus on soc discharges from cpm is essential including the design of situation specific monitoring as well as risk assessment and mitigation strategies that consider the variability of industrial emissions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micropollutants industrial wastewater chemical and pharmaceutical industry high resolution mass spectrometry non target analysis temporal data 1 introduction wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents are a major source of synthetic organic contaminants socs to the aquatic environment there is evidence that in addition to domestic wastewater wastewaters from chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing cpm can contribute substantially to the loads of socs emitted to surface waters anliker et al 2020a anliker et al 2020b cardoso et al 2014 kleywegt et al 2019 larsson 2014 schlusener et al 2015 scott et al 2018 however to date most studies on cpm emissions in wwtp effluents including our own anliker et al 2020a anliker et al 2020b investigated the wastewaters of individual industries or industrial sites hence it is currently unclear whether soc emissions from cpm are isolated events or widespread to the best of our knowledge there are only two studies both focusing on pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in north america kleywegt et al 2019 scott et al 2018 that have assessed cpm discharges from different locations based on large sets of 100 target compounds it was clearly shown that the wastewaters of every company emitted substantially higher pharmaceutical loads than those detected in domestic wastewaters however these studies focused on target compounds in individual grab samples and therefore do not fully reflect the complexity and dynamics of cpm wastewaters indeed the temporal and compositional dynamics of cpm discharges overall have been rarely investigated to date the available studies have shown that cpm discharges strongly vary over time and that long term and high temporal resolution sampling is essential to capture production cycle dependent cpm emissions and related peak concentrations anliker et al 2020a anliker et al 2020b ruppe et al 2018 schlusener et al 2015 for a thorough chemical characterization of such complex samples high resolution mass spectrometry hrms has been established as the method of choice as it provides comprehensive information on both known and unknown compounds and hence does not rely on prior knowledge of the sample composition e g comprehensive production data which is commonly very difficult to obtain for cpm cardoso et al 2014 phillips et al 2010 moreover recently the analysis of entire datasets of unidentified lc hrms signals chemical fingerprints has increasingly been applied for the characterization and differentiation of various emissions sources of socs often in combination with time trend or spatial analysis anliker et al 2020a beckers et al 2020 chiaia hernandez et al 2017 du et al 2020 schollée et al 2021 without identifying specific compounds these non target investigations of hrms datasets are extremely valuable for a better understanding of soc sources in general however chemical characterization alone does not provide information about the ecotoxicological relevance of the detected hrms signals to evaluate the potential impacts of the wwtp effluents on aquatic communities lc hrms data eventually need to be related to toxicological effects brack et al 2018 yet time resolved toxicological evaluations are time consuming costly and therefore rare the goal of this study was to characterize soc discharges from cpm via wwtps on a national scale and to evaluate their relevance as soc source affecting surface water quality in comparison to domestic wastewaters specifically we were interested in i investigating the occurrence and spatial distribution of cpm discharges in switzerland ii describing their influence on effluent chemical composition and dynamics and iii providing a first assessment of potential factors that influence the extent and the characteristics of soc emissions from cpm in wwtp effluents finally we aimed to exemplarily link comprehensive temporal hrms data with temporal toxicity data to identify the cause of adverse effects observed in cpm wastewater to achieve these goals we extended our previous investigations of soc discharges from pharmaceutical manufacturing anliker et al 2020a anliker et al 2020b to a much larger set of wwtps including ones that receive substantial shares of wastewater from chemical facilities in a first step swiss wwtp catchments were analyzed systematically for the presence of cpm using geographic information system gis analysis and structural business statistics data based on this analysis seven wwtps were selected as sampling sites each receiving various shares of wastewater from diverse cpm facilities for 2 3 months daily effluent samples were taken at each wwtp and analyzed with lc hrms we then compared the time series datasets of the seven wwtps measured for the current study along with previously acquired data of four additional wwtps anliker et al 2020a anliker et al 2020b using a non target approach rather than on structure elucidation the analysis focused on general characteristics of the hrms time series inventories such as the number of compounds that persisted during wastewater treatment intensity variations over time and maximal intensities eventually due to the commitment of one of the connected industries comprehensive bioassays were performed at one wwtp in parallel to our lc hrms based monitoring for this wwtp lc hrms time series were correlated with ecotoxicity time series to find toxicity causing components based on matching time patterns as far as we are aware the current study is the first attempt to assess the relevance of soc discharges from cpm on a national level using comprehensive temporal lc hrms data 2 materials and methods 2 1 geospatial data analysis to assess the cpm industrial density per wwtp catchment geospatial data analysis was performed with the open source geographic information system software qgis version 3 10 qgis development team 2020 the swiss business statistics dataset swiss federal statistical office 2016 was filtered for entries of chemical and pharmaceutical industries i e for general classification of economic activities noga swiss federal office 2021b divisions 20 manufacture of chemicals and chemical products and 21 manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical preparations the spatial resolution of the business statistics data was one hectare and values 3 were set to 3 in the original dataset to prevent the identification of individual industries the number of full time equivalent employees and the number of workplaces i e facilities within the chemical and pharmaceutical sector extracted from the business statistics was then intersected with the wwtp catchment areas eawag 2014 additionally for the visualization fig 1 the following basic swiss geospatial data were used national boundaries swisstopo 2015 lake shorelines swisstopo 2007 and the water network swiss federal office for the environment 2015 2 2 sampling site description this study analyzed the effluents of 11 wwtps of different sizes and technologies across switzerland which treated differing shares of cpm wastewater 0 100 see supplementary information si 1 for the sampling site selection criteria the effluents of seven wwtps were sampled for the present study and samples from four wwtps have been taken previously anliker et al 2020a anliker et al 2020b eight of the investigated wwtps receive both domestic and industrial wastewater one exclusively treats cpm wastewater and for comparison two only treat domestic wastewater this selection is representative of the situation in switzerland where the vast majority of cpm sites discharge their wastewater to municipal wwtps summary information on the 11 wwtps considered in this study are given in table 1 because the sampling at all wwtps was conducted under non disclosure agreements the locations of the wwtps and the names of the companies have been anonymized similarly the names of the compounds reported to be processed by industry have been removed hereafter the wwtps receiving cpm wastewater are referred to as cp and cpf with cpf referring specifically to wwtps that receive wastewater only from formulating and not producing cpm activities indicating the volume in percent industrial wastewater and the purely domestic wwtps are referred to as d01 and d02 the absolute volume of industrial wastewater treated varied between 50 and 9 600 m3 d for the wwtps with cpm in their catchments in this context it is important to notice that a small amount of industrial wastewater can already contribute substantially to the total influent doc see table 1 the purely industrial wwtp cp100 represents an exception insofar as it has much lower capacity than all other wwtps and is equipped with an advanced treatment specifically for soc removal i e activated carbon adsorption the other wwtps receive mixed influents and have only mechanical and conventional biological treatment steps which are in some cases complemented with phosphorous removal nitrification and denitrification these mostly biology based treatments will remain standard at most municipal swiss wwtps also in the foreseeable future as only selected 100 out of 718 wwtps will be upgraded with an additional treatment for soc removal swiss federal office 2021a biological treatment options are also the standard in other counties worldwide that have central wastewater treatment in terms of connected industries it should be noted that at four wwtps the cpm wastewater originates from a single company whereas at five it stems from several companies so called cpm clusters the in total 23 facilities covered by the study include producing chemical industries that synthesize plant protection products and base chemicals as well as producing and formulating i e facilities that process active pharmaceutical ingredients into medical end products pharmaceutical industries several companies are involved in research and development activities and for the majority of the companies on demand custom synthesis is an important part of their business activities there are wwtp catchments with a relatively low number of 101 500 employees in cpm as well as two catchments with 2 000 employees while this might not be the case everywhere kleywegt et al 2019 in switzerland cpm wastewater is generally pretreated on site before its collection in large buffer tanks from where it is then directed to a wwtp straub et al 2020 all the cpm companies covered in this study incinerate their most contaminated wastewaters based on information provided by companies connected to cp60 and cp100 the volume of incinerated wastewater amounts to 20 000 m3 and 10 000 m3 per year respectively apart from incinerating the most problematic wastewaters the level of on site wastewater pretreatment differed substantially among the companies it ranged from simple neutralization to highly specific treatment of individual wastewater streams using e g distillation chemical oxidation or activated carbon adsorption in some cases detailed information on pretreatment and on site wastewater handling was difficult to obtain and is therefore missing in table 1 while each constituting a specific case we think that together the sampling sites included in this study do reflect the variety of cpm wastewater in switzerland and are therefore suitable to describe soc discharges from this industrial sector on a national scale 2 3 chemicals and solutions information on the chemicals and solutions used for chemical analysis is provided in the si 2 2 4 sample collection and storage wwtp effluents were sampled to determine the socs released to surface waters to take into account the dynamics of cpm emissions and to increase the probability of capturing short term discharges highly resolved temporal sampling was performed for several months at cp1 0 and cp25 sampling was conducted for 2 months from early september until end of october 2017 56 samples per sampling site at d02 cp1 7 cp50 cp60 and cp100 the sampling campaign lasted for 3 months from end of october 2017 until end of january 2018 91 samples per sampling site daily 24 h composite samples were collected by the staff of the wwtps using the available on site infrastructure each day a sample aliquot of 50 ml was filled in a 100 ml glass bottle and stored at 4 c at the end of each week samples were shipped on ice to the laboratory and stored at 20 c until chemical analysis maximum six months after the end of the sampling campaign 2 5 sample preparation samples were prepared and analyzed in one batch per wwtp after thawing 5 ml of each sample were centrifuged megafuge 1 0 r heraeus sepatech at a relative centrifugal force of 3 g at 25 c for 15 min in glass vials to remove suspended particles then 1 5 ml supernatant were transferred to 2 ml glass measurement vials and spiked with 15 μl of a solution containing 235 isotope labeled internal standards istds si 3 table s1 the concentration of each istd was 1 µg l for the cp1 0 and cp25 samples and 2 µg l for all other wwtps see si 5 for details for the cp1 0 and cp25 samples a ten point calibration ranging from 0 005 to 10 µg l with a mix of 659 compounds si 4 table s2 including 114 compounds known to be manufactured at one of the cpm sites considered in this study was prepared in ultrapure water for all other wwtps a seven point calibration from 0 025 to 10 µg l was used in the following compounds for which an authentic reference standard was available and analyzed are referred to as target compounds during sample preparation for each sampling site four samples were spiked with the target compounds two samples each at a concentration of 0 1 and 1 µg l to assess recoveries additionally duplicates were prepared for three samples of each wwtp and measured for quality control finally laboratory method blank samples were included in the measurement to determine contamination and carry over 2 6 lc hrms measurements the wwtp effluent samples were analyzed by large volume direct injection lc hrms the samples of the different wwtps were measured in separate sequences to ensure the quality of the measurements the analytical instrument was cleaned and calibrated before each sequence in each sequence after every tenth wwtp sample a blank ultrapure water without and a blank with istds was analyzed the calibration curve was measured at the beginning and at the end of each sequence a sample volume of 50 μl was injected and separated with a mobile phase gradient water methanol both acidified with 0 1 formic acid on a reversed phase c18 column atlantis t3 3 μm particle size 3 0 150 mm inner diameter waters at a flow rate of 300 µl min hrms data was acquired on a hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer qexactive plus thermo scientific in positive and negative electrospray ionization esi mode in separate runs full scan spectra of two mass ranges i e 50 105 m z and 100 1000 m z were recorded at a resolution r of 35 000 and 140 000 at m z 200 respectively these full scans were followed by six data independent ms ms experiments r 17 500 at m z 200 because of the large differences in sample matrix slight adaptions to the method between sample measurements of different wwtps were necessary these are detailed in si 5 further details on the analytical instrumentation and the method are provided elsewhere anliker et al 2020b based on the istds and the quantified target compounds measurements generally resulted in mass errors 2 ppm and retention time rt deviations 30 sec measurement quality control data is presented in si 6 although the focus of this work is on socs the generic analytical method used may also have captured natural organic compounds and a few inorganics 2 7 lc hrms data processing and data analysis the lc hrms non target data processing closely followed the procedure described in anliker et al 2020a here the envimass workflow version 4 3 loos 2021 was used for the automatic generation of intensity time series of all lc hrms full scan features i e chromatographic peaks defined by m z and rt detected in the mass range of 100 1000 m z the data of each wwtp were processed in a separate batch the processing steps and settings of the envimass workflow are given in si 7 and si 8 respectively and details on the extraction of time series and subsequent filtering for relevant entries are described in anliker et al 2020a importantly only signals of an intensity 1e5 and time series with an average sample blank ratio 10 were considered in the analysis since componentization was performed i e features of adduct and isotopologues belonging to the same component were grouped and only the most intense entry was retained it was assumed that each feature in the final datasets corresponds to one compound selected target compounds were quantified with the software tracefinder 4 1 thermo scientific quantification was based on the area ratio of the reference standard and the istd of the analyte compounds were considered quantifiable if the relative recovery based on spiked samples and the reproducibility based on replicate samples was in a range of 75 to 125 overall the lc hrms data of 853 effluent samples were analyzed in this study between 56 and 91 for each of the 11 wwtps as mentioned above the data of the daily wwtp effluents samples from d01 and cp3 0 3 months observation period and cpf0 1 and cpf2 3 2 months observation period were acquired in the framework of previous studies these data were acquired and processed using a very similar approach to the one described here details are given in anliker et al 2020a for d01 and cp3 0 and in anliker et al 2020b for cpf0 1 and cpf2 3 data analysis was performed using the statistical software r version 3 6 1 r core team 2017 with the basic functions if not stated otherwise for quantification of the overall intensity variation the fold change observed in hrms time series was calculated as the ratio of the 0 95 quantile to the 0 05 quantile of the intensity values according to anliker et al 2020a as proposed previously anliker et al 2020a a threshold for overall time series variation 10 fold was used to detect potential cpm emissions assuming that large fluctuations were linked to production cycles a mass window tolerance of 2ppm and a rt tolerance of 30s was applied to define matching feature pairs between different wwtps for the correlation analysis non detects in the lc hrms data were set to zero spearman s rank order correlation coefficients ρ between hrms time series and toxicity time series were calculated using the r cor test function 2 8 bioassays a comprehensive ecotoxicological study with the effluents of cp60 was performed by a private laboratory soluval santiago couvet switzerland on behalf of one of the companies connected to the wwtp for this simultaneously to the lc hrms sample collection daily 24 h composite effluent samples were taken in vivo bioassays were then conducted for the 91 samples according to iso standards in screening mode i e at a reduced number of concentrations and replicates acute toxicity tests were performed for microcrustaceans daphnia magna endpoint immobilization and mortality duration 48 h iso 6341 bacteria microtoxtm vibrio fischeri bioluminescence 0 5 h iso 11348 3 as well as chronic toxicity tests with green algae raphidocelis subcapitata growth 72 h iso 8692 and macrophytes lemna minor population growth 7 d iso 20079 the results of the ecotoxicological assessment were expressed in toxic units see si 9 for details however as requested by the company that provided the data all toxicity data are given as normalized values only a fixed value was used for results below the sensitivity limit of the bioassays see si 9 in this work the toxicity time series were correlated with the lc hrms time series of cp60 thereby obtaining a virtual fractionation to identify features that potentially cause the observed ecotoxicological effects see section 2 7 similar approaches based on multivariate variate data analysis instead of time series have successfully been applied previously eide et al 2004 eide et al 2002 hug et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 presence of chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in swiss wwtp catchments according to the statistical records swiss federal statistical office 2016 there is relative to the country s small area of 41 300 km2 a considerable number of 1 000 industrial premises in the chemical 727 and pharmaceutical 279 sector registered the gis based analysis showed that chemical and pharmaceutical industries are located in 271 38 of the 718 swiss wwtp catchments the number of full time equivalent employees per catchment as a proxy for cpm industrial density is illustrated in the map in fig 1 discussions with the respective cantonal authorities revealed that a high number of full time employees in cpm industries was for most catchments a good indicator for identifying wwtps that treat substantial amounts of cpm wastewater in a few cases only it was found that cpm locations are purely administrative or the respective companies do not discharge any manufacturing wastewater as this was the case for wwtp d01 for instance table 1 in the majority of the wwtp catchments with cpm 172 of 271 there are 100 employees in the respective industry branch the analysis identified only four catchments with more than 2000 full time employees in the cpm sector these findings indicate that many wwtps in the swiss plateau potentially receive wastewater from cpm mostly from small to middle sized facilities hence contamination from cpm is potentially widespread nationwide and focusing on the well known cpm hotspots might miss important contributions it can be assumed that the situation is similar in other regions of the world where cpm locations are far more numerous than in switzerland e g 30 000 all over europe european chemical industry council 2020 25 000 in the us the international trade administration 2021 and 20 000 in china chen and reniers 2020 to the best of our knowledge systematic assessments of cpm emissions in these countries are missing and an analysis as the one presented here could provide valuable first insights into the prevalence of potential cpm contamination 3 2 characteristics of temporal lc hrms signatures in wwtp effluents next we were interested if the presence of cpm in the wastewater wwtp catchment has an actual impact on the effluents to this end we analyzed the effluent data of the 11 wwtps data processing resulted in a time series for each of the several thousand features detected in the lc hrms measurements of the effluent samples ranging from 4 542 cpf0 1 to 69 480 cp50 per wwtp fig 2 a first we characterized the time series datasets with a non target approach and then compared them considering the different contributions of cpm wastewater at each wwtp in the interest of clarity the data of the esi positive and negative mode measurements are discussed together 3 2 1 comparison of purely domestic and cpm wastewater receiving wwtp effluents starting with a general comparison of purely domestic and cpm influenced wwtp effluents clear differences were already apparent at the level of doc concentrations which were generally higher and fluctuated more at wwtps receiving cpm wastewater si 10 however doc measurements do not provide information on the composition of the effluents the lc hrms time series datasets revealed that compared to purely domestic wwtp effluents up to 15 times more features were detected in cpm wastewater receiving wwtp effluents fig 2 a suggesting that a larger substance spectrum was emitted in the latter furthermore the share of features with very high intensities i e 1e8 was larger at the wwtps that receive cpm wastewater ranging up to 7 compared to d01 and d02 with a share 1 si 11 figure s3 even though feature intensities cannot be directly transferred into concentrations because of different ionization efficiencies of the underlying compounds high intensities still often correspond to high concentrations hence the results imply that more compounds with very high concentrations were discharged in the effluents of wwtps receiving cpm wastewater compared to purely domestic ones we then focused on features with intensity variations 10 fold in their time series in the following referred to as highly fluctuating features i e potential industrial emissions see section 2 7 here the percentage of highly fluctuating features varied between 2 6 d01 and 16 7 cp50 fig 2 a black bars the number of highly fluctuating features was generally larger at wwtps that treat cpm wastewater and features with extreme variations i e 1 000 fold were only detected at these wwtps si 11 overall these general differences between purely domestic and wwtps receiving cpm wastewater were consistent with the findings of our previous work anliker et al 2020a which was based on comparing d01 and cp3 0 only given the large share of cpm wastewater in some of the wwtps the percentages of highly fluctuating features might seem relatively small however highly fluctuating features accounted for a much larger proportion 40 of the total measured intensity at the majority of the wwtps receiving cpm wastewater compared to purely domestic wwtps 20 fig 2 b this implies that highly fluctuating features most likely indicative of industrial discharges contributed considerably to total substance emissions the temporal patterns of the share of highly fluctuating features relative to the total intensity is provided in si 12 overall the comparison of the non target time series datasets of purely domestic and cpm influenced wwtp effluents indicated that substantial emissions in terms of both substance diversity and magnitude from cpm are rather the rule than the exception this conclusion is in accordance with the two other large scale studies on soc discharges from cpm both of which concluded that pharmaceutical manufacturing wastewaters were generally a relevant source of pharmaceuticals to the aquatic environment kleywegt et al 2019 scott et al 2018 in the future as a consequence of the current covid pandemic cpm activities are expected to increase in switzerland and the eu due to recent initiatives to bring back pharmaceutical production to europe to reduce the risk of medicine shortages european commission 2020 at the international level based on available literature larsson et al 2007 li et al 2008 it can be assumed that contamination from cpm is even more relevant in regions of the world with much higher production volumes and less focus on surface water quality therefore in many parts or the world cpm is likely a currently underestimated source of socs influencing water quality 3 2 2 differences between the effluents of cpm wastewater receiving wwtps as described in the section above cpm influenced wwtps were generally observed to have a large number of total features a large portion of intense features and a large proportion of highly fluctuating features however these characteristics did not correlate well to other factors such as the percentage of industrial wastewater the number of employees or the doc concentration a comprehensive analysis of the factors affecting cpm emissions was not possible due to missing information on industrial processes wastewater handling and pre treatment nevertheless a closer inspection of specific cases did reveal potential explanations for the differences observed among the cpm influenced wwtps first there seems to be a difference between producing and formulating facilities this difference might originate from the fact that formulating industries commonly emit fewer compounds for example during our sampling campaign at wwtp cpf0 1 and cpf2 3 only 77 different compounds were processed by the five companies involved in the study anliker et al 2020b compared to hundreds of compounds expected from synthesis activities including starting materials end products catalysts solvents intermediates and byproducts howard and muir 2013 apart from their small shares of cpm wastewater this might explain why at cpf0 1 and cpf2 3 highly fluctuating emissions contributed comparatively little 20 to the overall intensity fig 2 b still active pharmaceutical ingredients processed by formulating industries were responsible for the highest peak concentrations measured in the effluents of both wwtps anliker et al 2020b second as expected the extent to which cpm discharges are detected in wwtps effluents seems to largely depend on the wastewater pre treatment on the one hand cp1 7 and cp3 0 where highly fluctuating features contributed disproportionately 50 despite industrial wastewater shares 5 vol to the total intensities fig 2 b are known to have insufficient pretreatment and requirements for mitigation measures have been imposed on the respective companies on the other hand activated carbon adsorption is in place at two wwtps as an on site advanced pretreatment prior to release to cp1 0 and as final wwtp treatment step at cp100 at both wwtps relatively few features and smaller proportions of highly fluctuating emissions were detected fig 2 a however at cp100 the daily share of highly fluctuating features on the total emissions varied substantially fig 2 b when considering the time pattern of the total intensities at cp100 si 12 figure s4 k it becomes apparent that this variation was caused by one event of very high cumulative intensities also reflected in increased doc concentrations this event was attributable to a malfunction of the wwtp highlighting that a correctly operating treatment is fundamental to prevent emissions and that the fluctuating emissions observed at cp100 were in contrast to our initial assumption not per se caused by production cycles third industrial wastewater storage and discharge practices appear to strongly influence the dynamics of cpm discharges observed in wwtp effluents in particular at cp25 cpm wastewater is collected in large stacking tanks and released little by little into the wwtp this controlled discharge likely averages out production dependent fluctuations and might explain why relatively few highly fluctuating features were detected in the effluents of cp25 hence as has been highlighted previously anliker et al 2020b kleywegt et al 2019 for data interpretation knowledge on the production cycles and the companies wastewater handling is essential in some cases focusing on highly fluctuating features might be misleading and will miss relevant cpm discharges therefore considering additional indicators for industrial emissions might be necessary such as site specificity of features or much higher intensities of relatively constant features compared to other sites krauss et al 2019 3 3 comparison of the composition of wwtp effluents so far the focus was on the overall feature characteristics of the investigated wwtp effluents next we compared the composition of the effluents with a focus on the top most intense features assuming that those are the most relevant from a concentration point of view first we investigated the overlap of features between the different wwtps specifically we extracted the 100 most intense features at each wwtp and analyzed the percentage of matching features i e same m z and rt the results are displayed as overlap matrices in fig 3 generally more overlapping features were found between the effluents of wwtps that are less influenced by cpm wastewater i e up to 35 d02 and cpf2 3 in positive and up to 49 cpf0 1 and cp1 0 in negative esi mode in contrast the wwtps that receive 25 vol cpm wastewater had maximally 7 overlapping features with any other wwtp in esi positive mode and 18 in esi negative mode respectively this result indicates that compounds with highest concentrations in domestic wastewater are rather similar between different wwtps while they are site specific in the cpm wastewater influenced effluents we then looked for target compounds i e known substances for which reference standards were available and analyzed among the overlapping features it was found that compounds detected at more than two wwtps were substances known to be present at high concentrations in domestic wastewater effluents benzotriazole detected among the most intense features at 8 wwtps 4 5 methylbenzotriazole 6 metformin 5 4 acetamidoantipyrine 5 tramadol and o desvenlafaxine isobaric co eluting 5 gabapentin 5 n n diethyl 3 methylbenzamide deet 4 and irbesartan 3 in positive esi and the artificial sweeteners acesulfame 7 and saccharine 4 in negative esi mode however these well known domestic wastewater contaminants only rarely appeared among the 100 most intense features at wwtps strongly influenced by cpm wastewater generally the 100 most intense features of these wwtps only contained few target compounds anyhow and the ones found were typically reported i e either confidentially by the company or on a publicly available product list to be manufactured by a cpm company in the catchment of the respective wwtp these cpm target compounds were usually not measured in domestic wastewater or at much lower concentrations i e 1 2 orders of magnitude si 13 table s4 thus supporting our previous results from a smaller set of wwtps anliker et al 2020a anliker et al 2020b in summary each cpm site displays its very own substance spectrum and relevant compounds are hence site specific searching for features of high intensity variations in lc hrms time series anliker et al 2020a proved efficient in most cases to detect potential cpm discharges and thus can be applied in other regions of the world to obtain an initial estimate of the extent of such emissions however compound specific monitoring and sound environmental risk assessments of cpm discharges remain very challenging since each situation has to be assessed individually 3 4 identifying lc hrms features causing toxicity in the following we discuss the results of correlating the toxicity data with the lc hrms chemical data while no significant toxicity was observed in the acute toxicity assays with microcrustaceans and luminescent bacteria distinct time periods of substantial effects occurred in the chronic tests with green algae and macrophytes for the green algae significant toxicity was observed in the effluent samples during the last 20 days of the sampling campaign correlation of the hrms data with the algae toxicity data resulted in only one feature with a highly correlated time series i e spearman s ρ 0 9 fig 4 a the chemical structure of the measured m z 112 9857 deprotonated molecular ion was identified and confirmed with a reference standard as trifluoracetic acid tfa level 1 identification schymanski et al 2014 the maximum effluent concentration was estimated retrospectively based on a one point calibration and amounted to approximately 10 mg l although tfa is widely used in organic synthesis intensive follow up investigations of the concerned company showed that in this case tfa was formed during a specific waste stream pre treatment changing the pre treatment process substantially reduced the effluent toxicity importantly this example demonstrates that unidentified compounds in cpm wastewater might be responsible for considerable toxicity and as a consequence that risk assessments focusing only on active ingredients are insufficient for the macrophytes duckweed increased toxicity was observed during two short periods of 3 and 1 days the time series of three hrms features that were very well correlated with the macrophytes toxicity could be associated through different adducts indicating that feature componentization was not always successful to a herbicide herb a produced by a company connected to cp60 in fig 4 b the data of the most intense adduct m h is shown the other time series are given in si 14 figures s5 m and n indeed duckweed is well known to be sensitive to herb a epa 2020 while tfa corresponded to the 10th most intense feature i e according to maximum intensity during the sampling period in negative esi the most intense adduct of herb a was on rank 1204 only in positive esi demonstrating that also less intense features might be ecotoxicologically relevant herb a was on the confidential product list provided by the company and was included in our measurements as cpm target compound i e an authentic reference standard was measured leading to level 1 identification schymanski et al 2014 quantification resulted in a maximal effluent concentration of 9 3 µg l considering the complex composition of the effluents it is surprising that in both algae and macrophytes toxicity only one single compound was found to be responsible for the observed effects only for the macrophytes toxicity additional hrms features resulted in very high correlation coefficients si 14 figure s5 however none of them explained both periods of increased toxicity moreover some of the observed high correlations were rather uncertain because intensities of the corresponding hrms features were close to the limit of detection lod and or few data points were detected yet experiments with the individual substances showed increased toxicity by 170 and 140 for herb a and tfa respectively in non toxic cp60 effluent 7 day composite sample compared to standard test medium epa aap epa 1996 this observation suggests that the sample matrix can influence observed compound toxicity this might be due to synergistic effects with matrix components or enhanced bioavailability in the effluent samples in summary combining temporal hrms chemical data with temporal toxicity data proved highly successful in identifying compounds in cpm wastewaters that were toxic in in vivo bioassays fundamental to the success of time series correlation was the availability of high temporally resolved data reflecting daily fluctuations and short term peaks as well as the presence of distinct time patterns in these data 4 conclusions long term daily lc hrms effluent signatures of 11 swiss wwtps receiving 0 100 vol of cpm wastewater were acquired and analyzed in this study using mainly a non target approach this unique dataset enabled assessing the complexity diversity and contaminant dynamics of cpm discharges via wwtp effluents for the first time on a national level the results showed that cpm is surprisingly widely distributed across switzerland and 30 of the municipal wwtps potentially receive cpm wastewater suggesting that also in other countries cpm discharges might be a more widespread source of soc contamination than anticipated substantial soc emissions from cpm have to be expected unless i the share of industrial wastewater on the total wwtp flow is very low 5 ii a highly advanced wastewater pre treatment is in place and iii the number of compounds handled on site is small effluents mainly dominated by households exhibited relatively constant temporal dynamics and their composition was similar among different wwtps whereas cpm influenced effluents generally showed higher complexity variability and site specificity in some cases even small amounts of cpm wastewater 5 caused significant changes in the effluent composition compared to emissions in domestic wastewaters amounts of socs discharged in cpm wastewater may be very high i e up to 15 times more compounds and 1 2 orders of magnitude higher signal intensities indicating higher concentrations were observed because of the diversity of this industrial branch there are large differences in the dynamics and compositions between the effluents of cpm influenced wwtps compounds relevant for monitoring differ from facility to facility and often include non registered chemicals hence the strategies currently applied to monitor soc emissions in domestic wwtp effluents by performing sporadic measurements of a predefined set of target compounds are not suitable to assess cpm discharges rather the site specificity of cpm discharges requires considering the individual situation to achieve sound risk assessments and to define suitable monitoring programs and mitigation measures combining temporal hrms data and temporal toxicity data was highly successful to identify toxicity causing compounds in cpm wastewater and indicated that unknown unexpected and low abundant compounds may be ecotoxicologically relevant overall we conclude that in countries where cpm is present soc contamination from this industrial source is likely an underestimated factor influencing the quality of surface waters applying multiple mitigation strategies is essential to reduce the potential environmental impact of cpm wastewaters including reducing soc load and complexity as well as removing the most toxic compounds in the future innovative technical solutions are needed as an alternative to wastewater incineration which is very energy inefficient finally further studies are required to contribute to a better awareness of soc discharges from cpm and to increase the companies commitment to put their principles of environmental sustainability more rigorously into action in fact at cpm sites where mitigation measures have been implemented the impact of soc discharges on water quality could be substantially reduced declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

16147,current research focuses on introducing additional energy or reducing agents to directly accelerate the formation of fe iv and fe v from ferrate fe vi thereby ameliorating the oxidation activity of fe vi interestingly this study discovers that colloid manganese dioxide cmno2 can remarkably promote fe vi to remove various contaminants via a novel surface promoted pathway many lines of evidence suggest that high valent fe species are the primary active oxidants in the cmno2 fe vi system however the underlying activation mechanism for the direct reduction of fe vi by cmno2 to generate fe iv fe v is eliminated further analysis found that fe vi can combine with the vacancies in cmno2 to form precursor complex cmno2 fe vi which possesses a higher oxidation potential than fe vi this makes cmno2 fe vi is more vigorous to oxidize pollutants with electron rich moieties through the electron transfer step than alone fe vi resulting in producing fe v and fe iv the products of fe vi decay i e fe ii fe iii and h2o2 are revealed to play vital roles in further boosting the formation of fe iv and fe v most importantly the catalytic stability of cmno2 in complicated waters is superior to popular reductants suggesting its outstanding application potential taken together this work provides a full scale insight into the surface promoted mechanism in fe vi oxidation process thus providing an efficient and green strategy for fe vi activation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ferrate colloid manganese dioxide surface promoted sulfamethoxazole oxidation 1 introduction for meeting the requirement of clean water resources developing more eco friendly and flexible wastewater treatment technologies has set off an upsurge recently ferrate fe vi has received increasing attention in wastewater treatment by right of its aptitude in multifunctional water remediation i e chemical oxidation disinfection and coagulation hu et al 2012 talaiekhozani et al 2017 as a powerful oxidant fe vi exhibits excellent potential in efficiently degrading a wide range of micropollutants with electron rich moieties like anilines phenols and amines sharma 2011 nevertheless the effectiveness of fe vi is still inefficient for some recalcitrant compounds and highly dependent on the solution ph luo et al 2020 sharma 2010 up to now many efforts have been made to activate fe vi via forming high valent fe intermediates i e fe iv and fe v or other reactive radicals e g oh and so4 gong et al 2020 sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 it is known that compared with radical active oxidants non radical species have conspicuous virtue in resistance to inorganic ions and natural organics since of their selectivity and moderate oxidation activity duan et al 2018 terryn et al 2017 fe iv and fe v as typical non radical oxidants are reported to have 2 5 orders of magnitude more reactive than fe vi sharma et al 2022 zhu et al 2020 therefore in order to improve the sluggish reactivity of fe vi under alkaline conditions current research mainly focuses on developing promising systems to induce fe vi to produce fe iv and fe v several reducing reagents such as h2o2 nh2oh and fe2 have been explored to expedite the elimination of target contaminants via producing more fe iv and fe v luo et al 2021 shao et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 nonetheless these homogeneous reductants may show low feasibility for practical use due to their inherent defect in generating secondary pollution besides various carbonaceous materials e g biochar carbon nanotubes and graphene characterized with high efficiency and easy availability were used to activate fe vi pan et al 2020 tian et al 2020 experimental results confirmed that they execute the role of electronic sacrifices to boost the introduction of fe iv and fe v sun et al 2019 tian et al 2020 at present there is limited information regarding intensifying fe vi through other sustainable and green strategies to form fe iv and fe v colloid manganese dioxide cmno2 the product of permanganate mn vii decomposition bio catalysis of dissolved manganese and mineral weathering has been frequently found in natural and engineered waters afonso et al 2003 buffle and leppard 1995 cheng et al 2019 by right of its higher surface area than other naturally occurring types of mno2 αmno2 βmno2 γmno2 and δmno2 cmno2 is known to be the most reactive phase of mn iv in contaminant removal and catalytic oxidation reactions liu et al 2019 as a fascinating catalyst cmno2 can activate various oxidants to eliminate micropollutants and heavy metal ions yu et al 2020 zou et al 2020 for example zou et al found that the introduction of cmno2 can contribute to better oxidation efficiency of thallium i by hocl and that vacancies play a pivotal role in cmno2 catalysis cui et al 2017 besides it was reported that cmno2 formed by in situ mn vii reduction can reinforce the connection between mn vii and concerned pollutants thus improving the decontamination performance of mn vii jiang et al 2009 yu et al 2020 considering the similarity between mn vii and fe vi both of which have several high valent reactive intermediates coupling fe vi with cmno2 might be an attractive candidate to efficiently remove micropollutants therefore the objective of this work is to investigate the influence of cmno2 on fe vi oxidized organic compounds and subsequently discuss the possible activation mechanism of cmno2 to our delight cmno2 can boost fe vi to remove various micropollutants more interestingly this work comprehensively reveals that a novel surface promoted mechanism dominates the cmno2 fe vi oxidation process firstly probing experiments linear free energy relationships lfers and degradation products analysis directly or indirectly demonstrate that high valent fe species are the primary active oxidants in the cmno2 fe vi process solid evidence negates the contribution of cmno2 for direct reduction of fe vi the surface promoted mechanism is fully confirmed by in situ raman tests electrochemical analysis and galvanic oxidation process gop furthermore due to the prominent decomposition of fe vi in the presence of micropollutants with electron rich moieties we propose fe iv and fe v can be further formed from other pathways in the cmno2 fe vi process finally the practical application potential of cmno2 fe vi process was compared with representative reductant fe vi systems this work is conducive to advancing the cognition of the surface promoted mechanism in fe vi oxidation process to provide valuable guidance for developing efficient fe vi oxidation systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals various mno2 including αmno2 βmno2 γmno2 δmno2 and cmno2 were prepared the detailed preparing methods

study are described in text s2 and s3 2 2 experimental procedure all of the degradation reactions were repeated thrice at least to obtain the average values with standard deviations shown in this paper degradation reactions were conducted in 250 ml glass beakers under magnetic stirring at 25 1 c fe vi stock solution was prepared via dissolving k2feo4 in borate buffer ph 9 0 1 0 mm initially 3 ml smx solution 250 μm and 20 mm borate buffer ph 8 0 were added in reaction solution reactions were initiated by simultaneously adding 7 5 ml cmno2 1 0 mm and 50 ml fe vi stock solution unless specified illustration the ph of the reaction solution was maintained by borate buffer and adjusted via adding sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid when needed the ph change of the reaction solution was maintained within 0 1 reaction samples quenched by hydroxylamine 1 g l 1 were collected using a syringe at specific time intervals and filtered to remove impurities other experimental procedures are described in text s4 7 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of various micropollutants were measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 usa and the detailed conditions are described in text s8 the specific flow rates mobile phases and detection wavelengths for hplc detection are listed in table s1 the initial fe vi stock concentrations were quantified by examining their absorbance at 510 nm ε 1150 m 1 cm 1 by a uv vis spectrometer sharma et al 2015 our results show that the presence of cmno2 had a negligible impact on residual fe vi and h2o2 content detection and detailed detection procedures are depicted in text s9 and s10 besides smx degradation intermediates were analyzed by an ultra hplc quadrupole time of flight premier mass spectrometer uplc qtof ms ms agilent 6500 text s11 2 4 characterization mno2 with various crystals were analyzed by x ray diffractometer xrd panalytical b v holland and the corresponding xrd results were presented in fig s1 which suggest that cmno2 is amorphous cui et al also confirmed that the additional cmno2 shows a non crystallized state cui et al 2017 the surface morphology of cmno2 was observed by transmission electron microscope tem to confirm its unordered crystal structure fig s2a the surface area and structural properties of various mno2 were analyzed by a surface area analyzer bet micromeritics asap 2460 usa the chemical states of fresh and used cmno2 were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps with an al ka anode radiation and the in situ raman tests were performed by a microscopic raman system with a 532 nm excitation laser renishaw wotton under edge uk text s12 the zeta potential of cmno2 under different conditions and the particle size of cmno2 were evaluated by a zetasizer nano zs malvern uk the diameters of cmno2 are 57 64 nm confirming that the prepared cmno2 is in the form of colloid fig s2b 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalytic performance of cmno2 the catalytic performance of cmno2 in improving fe vi reactivity was evaluated for sulfamethoxazole smx a representative antibiotic which has been frequently examined in water removal nimai et al 2020 shang et al 2020 as shown in fig 1 a the removal efficiency of smx by alone fe vi is relatively limited 39 4 and the physical absorption and chemical oxidation of cmno2 at ph 8 0 only result in less than 1 0 smx removal to our delight a significant smx degradation ratio 85 7 was obtained by coupling fe vi with cmno2 although fe vi and cmno2 fe vi systems present similar capacity for smx removal after reacting 120 min cmno2 still is a promising choose to shorten the treatment reaction fig s3 moreover the catalytic capacity of other typical mno2 like αmno2 βmno2 γmno2 and δmno2 were examined fig 1 a depicts that they are unable to activate fe vi the discrepant catalytic activity of different types of mno2 might be deciphered by the fact that cmno2 characterized with amorphous shape possesses short range order and long range disorder structure thus having more surface defects and active sites li et al 2020 among the five types of mno2 cmno2 has the maximal surface area table s2 this makes it is more likely to contact with fe vi the apparent activation energies e a for smx removal in fe vi and cmno2 fe vi systems were calculated by the arrhenius equation to get an underlying cognition about the promotion kinetics text s13 the e a of the cmno2 fe vi system for smx removal is 20 61 kj mol 1 lower than that of the fe vi oxidation process 25 56 kj mol 1 fig s4 the removal efficiencies of fe vi and cmno2 fe vi systems for diverse pollutants were determined including carbamazepine cbz diclofenac dcf sulfisoxazole siz and atenolol atn fig 1 b suggests all the tested contaminants are oxidized more expeditiously with the addition of cmno2 no matter in borate buffer or in phosphate buffer and the cmno2 induced promotion effects significantly rest with the chemical structure of organic compounds moreover the application of cmno2 is viable to activate fe vi at ph 7 0 9 0 fig s5 but the cmno2 fe vi system exhibits a lower smx removal rate at higher ph the restricted effect is likely associated with the decreasing oxidation activity of fe vi with increasing ph lee et al 2009 it is worth noting that as the initial cmno2 dosage varied from 10 to 50 μm the oxidative capacity of the cmno2 fe vi system gradually increased with further increasing the cmno2 dose invariable smx removal ratios were obtained fig s6a the corresponding fe vi consumption was examined to decipher the phenomenon preliminarily fig s6b depicts that excessive cmno2 cannot trigger further fe vi consumption generally adding a high dose of reductant will rapidly consume fe vi luo et al 2021 hence the results may indicate the reducing contribution of cmno2 in activating fe vi is negligible additionally the capacity of coupling cmno2 with other oxidants h2o2 peroxymonosulfate pms peroxydisulfate pds mn vii and periodate io4 for smx removal were analyzed fig s7 shows cmno2 h2o2 cmno2 pds cmno2 pms cmno2 mn vii and cmno2 io4 oxidation processes suggest only 1 3 2 4 4 0 2 0 and 7 9 smx removal rate at ph 8 0 after reacting 5 min respectively although previous studies have elaborated the feasibility of cmno2 for elevating the oxidation capacity of a wide variety of oxidants du et al 2020 jiang et al 2009 zhao et al 2017 inconspicuous smx degradation was shown in the above systems under our experimental conditions these results strongly demonstrate the superiority of the cmno2 fe vi system under environmentally relevant conditions for rapidly degrading smx 3 2 identification of active oxidants since fe vi decomposition will produce several intermediates radicals and non radicals may be involved in the cmno2 fe vi system some studies have reported that mno2 can catalyze h2o2 to form high active oxidants i e o2 and oh he et al 2019 therefore cmno2 might react with h2o2 derived from fe vi self decay to generate radicals for oxidation of smx it was found that the cmno2 h2o2 system possess negligible capacity for smx removal and benzoic acid ba cannot be oxidized fig s7 and s8 meaning that no radicals participated in contaminant degradation in the cmno2 fe vi process additionally lfers were constructed to further confirm the oxidation properties the pseudo first order rates of 11 kinds of representative substituted phenols sps were calculated fig s9 shows that cmno2 can promote fe vi to remove all the tested sps with high rate constants which are 1 2 6 3 fold faster than those measured in the fe vi oxidation process to describe the effect of substitution group on oxidation kinetics related rate k rel was built using 4 chlorophenol cp as a reference compound i e lg k rel log k obs k cp where k obs and k cp refer to the degradation rate constant of various sps and cp respectively good line correlations between k rel and hammett constant σ were obtained in fe vi and cmno2 fe vi systems table s3 fig 2 a and s10 generally a negative slope means such an oxidation process is a typical electrophilic reaction lee and von gunten 2012 this suggests that despite the cmno2 fe vi system with higher oxidation activity it is still sluggish to react with electron withdrawing groups it should be noticed that alone fe vi slope 1 46 was less sensitive to the substituent effects than the cmno2 fe vi process slope 0 5 which may result from the involvement of other selective oxidants in the degradation of micropollutants detailed discussion will be presented in sections 3 4 and 3 5 methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso a frequently used chemical probe of fe iv and fe v was employed to confirm their contributions in oxidizing smx rao et al 2021 as shown in fig 2b a low dose of pmso can clearly deteriorate smx degradation meanwhile the yield of methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 the characteristic product of pmso oxidized by a two electron transfer step was calculated fig s11 delineates that cmno2 significantly boosts fe vi to oxidize pmso and approximate 100 pmso2 conversion percentages were observed in fe vi and cmno2 fe vi systems these consequences may indicate that more fe iv and fe v are introduced in the cmno2 fe vi system however since the real reaction rate of fe vi with pmso in the cmno2 fe vi system is unknown the specific contribution of high valent fe species fe vi fe v and fe iv in oxidizing smx is unclear based on the present experimental results here to get an in depth understanding of the active oxidants smx degradation intermediates were analyzed by uplc qtof ms ms a total of 9 oxidation products of smx were detected in fe vi and cmno2 fe vi systems fig s12 and s13 table s4 depicts that almost identical degradation intermediates are detected in fe vi and cmno2 fe vi processes which may clarify that the two systems contain same active species since fe iv and fe v cannot change the degradation products of smx by fe vi yang et al 2021 many studies have systematically demonstrated fe vi fe v and fe iv collectively contribute to oxidizing smx in fe vi system where fe iv and fe v are the primary active oxidants luo et al 2021 wang et al 2021 taken together our present concequences indicate fe vi fe v and fe iv may jointly participate in smx removal in the cmno2 fe vi system attentively the following discussion will emphasize the critical role of other active intermediates 3 3 confirmation of the reductive contribution of cmno2 recent studies mainly focused on developing green reducing agents to in situ reduce fe vi which is a state of the art strategy to boost the formation of fe iv and fe v from fe vi feng et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 therefore cmno2 may perform as an electron donor to accelerate fe vi decomposition thus introducing more fe iv and fe v to improve the oxidation kinetics of fe vi to verify the above speculation fe vi consumption in fe vi and cmno2 fe vi systems in the absence of smx was monitored 9 8 μm fe vi was decomposed at ph 8 0 after reaction 5 min in the fe vi process fig s14a to our surprise it was marginal to elevate fe vi consumption with the addition of cmno2 10 2 μm meanwhile pre mixing experiments were carried out to further exclude the reductive role of cmno2 cmno2 and fe vi were pre mixed in the reaction solution and 5 μm smx was subsequently added after determined time intervals considering the self decay of fe vi pre mixing experiments did not last more than 5 min to avoid the influence of fe vi content change on the degradation efficiency if reductive functional groups on cmno2 surface can directly reduce fe vi smx degradation rate will dramatically decrease after the pre mixing process due to the lessened fe vi content approximately identical degradation rates were presented after pre mixing 1 min and even 5 min fig 2c the results also suggest the marginal loss of fe vi after contacting with cmno2 in the absence of smx moreover to gain an in depth comprehension of the reductive contribution of cmno2 the catalytic activity of fresh cmno2 and pre oxidized cmno2 oxidized by ozone for 1 or 2 hours were comparatively examined fig 2 d shows the smx removal efficiency of pre oxidized cmno2 coupled with fe vi system is slightly inferior to the fresh cmno2 only 4 2 inhibition effect was observed in the pre oxidized system indicating that the reducing role of cmno2 in directly introducing the formation of fe iv and fe v is not significant xps results reveal that approximate 100 mn iv are presented no matter in the fresh cmno2 or the used cmno2 after reacting five cycles fig s14b and s14c the result of mn iv content in cmno2 agrees well with previous studies which suggested that ex situ cmno2 contains few mn iii cui et al 2017 zou et al 2020 therefore no low valence mn species involves in the direct fe vi reduction in a nutshell all the consequences attempt to deny the role of cmno2 in directly promoting fe vi decomposition to produce fe iv and fe v 3 4 insights into the surface promoted mechanism the role of cmno2 in reducing fe vi is ruled out while the results of probe detection and degradation product analysis proved that high valent fe species are the active oxidants in the cmno2 fe vi system therefore cmno2 may ameliorate fe vi reactivity through another way that markedly differs from the common reduction pathway here a novel surface promoted mechanism is proposed to dominate the cmno2 fe vi system based on the recent studies catalyst surface promoting the reactivity of oxidation system mainly includes two pathways i catalyst strongly adsorbs target compound to form pollutant catalyst interface which is more readily oxidized by the selected oxidant ke et al 2021 yu et al 2020 ii oxidant can interact with the catalyst to generate highly active intermediates which possess higher oxidation potential than alone oxidant ren et al 2019 jiang et al revealed that cmno2 could not boost mn vii to remove pmso and cbz because they do not contain the functional groups to connect with cmno2 jiang et al 2009 qi et al 2021 fig 1 b and s11 show the faster pmso and cbz degradation in the cmno2 fe vi oxidation process than fe vi system suggesting that the involvement of cmno2 pollutant complex is excluded to prove the potential catalyst oxidant surface promoted mechanism in situ raman spectroscopy tests were employed to gain the direct evidence of cmno2 surface bonding to fe vi and to analyze the surface chemical evolution of cmno2 fig 3 a the raman spectra of cmno2 are featured with a strong band at the region of 574 638 cm 1 which is assigned to the stretching vibrations of mno6 octahedra cheng et al 2014 it is evident that in the presence of fe vi the raman peak intensity at 574 cm 1 relatively decreased which might be caused by the intercalation of ions via affecting the mn o vibrations perpendicular to the direction of mno6 octahedral double chains cheng et al 2014 besides fe vi presented a prominent raman peak at 800 cm 1 which is ascribed to the fe o oscillator sitter et al 1985 it should be noticed that after adding cmno2 a new peak at 783 cm 1 was detected since a smaller value of the raman peak situation represents a longer metal o bond f d hardcastle and wachs 1990 the red shift of 17 cm 1 should be attributed to the bending vibrations of the prolonged fe o bond these results strongly manifest the formation of cmno2 fe vi moreover the inconspicuous effects of ionic strength on smx degradation also verified the inner sphere surface complexation between fe vi and cmno2 fig s15 in situ electrochemical analyses were used to further testify the formation of active complex and the raised oxidation potential of fe vi by cmno2 fig 3 b shows the open circuit potential of glassy carbon electrode gce with cmno2 coating cmno2 gce immediately rises to 0 527 v after adding fe vi and then decreased upon the addition of smx it is rational to speculate that activating fe vi to produce cmno2 fe vi can enhance the cmno2 potential while the decreased potential is resulted by the redox reaction between cmno2 fe vi and smx and the decomposition of the complex in contrast the potential changes after injecting fe vi 0 475 v and smx on blank gce surface are weaker than that on cmno2 gce surface these results clearly demonstrate that the metastable precursor complex cmno2 fe vi possesses a higher oxidation potential than fe vi and is therefore more prone to oxidizing smx the results of the chronoamperometry test also support the above conclusion as shown in fig s16 the injection of fe vi and smx distinctly affected the current output which is an indurative proof to state the direct oxidation process between precursor complex and smx the current change of cmno2 gce is more significant than that of blank gce meaning that cmno2 fe vi is more active to oxidize smx moreover gop was employed to further analyze the surface promoted mechanism fe vi and pollutant were separated into two independent cells which were connected by an agar salt bridge and an ampere meter and cmno2 was coated on the platinum electrode pe fig 3c when fe vi and smx were added in fe vi cell and pollutant cell concurrently a conspicuous current was detected that rose to 33 5 μa at 0 2 min and gradually decreased to 5 5 μa at 30 min whereas the addition of fe vi and smx in blank pe cannot trigger current variation fig 3d this phenomenon fully suggested the generation of metastable active complex and smx can directly donate electron to cmno2 fe vi otherwise the current can be detected similarly cbz and dcf featured with electron rich groups also stimulated current formation fig 3d however electron deficient pollutants like ba atrazine atz and ibuprofen ibu had faint effects on the current generation due to their relatively inadequate capacity in donating electron to cmno2 fe vi fig s17 that is cmno2 fe vi still is inefficient in removing pollutants with electron deficient groups mn iii hydroxyl groups and vacancy in cmno2 are generally considered as the underlying active sites since there is scarcely any mn iii in cmno2 fig s14b mn iii cannot act as the critical site to combine with fe vi previously pms and io4 were proved to be bounded onto manganese oxide by displacing hydroxyl groups to form complex du et al 2020 huang and zhang 2019 so4 2 is an excellent alternative to replace surface hydroxyl groups zou et al 2020 so the effect of so4 2 on smx degradation was verified fig 4 a depicts that adding so4 2 has no restrictive influence on smx removal in the cmno2 fe vi system which manifests the role of surface hydroxyl is excluded cheng et al proposed that divalent cations can act as bridging constituents to connect negatively charged cmno2 with fulvic acid via ameliorating the electronegativity of cmno2 cheng et al 2019 meanwhile surface vacancies were revealed to be the adsorption sites for cmno2 to combine with divalent cations zou et al 2020 therefore if surface vacancies are the critical catalytic sites of cmno2 fe vi reactivity for smx removal can be further improved in the presence of divalent cations due to the enhanced connection between fe vi and cmno2 an interesting phenomenon that ca2 and mg2 had positive effects on smx removal in the cmno2 fe vi system was shown fig 4b and c but ca2 and mg2 cannot accelerate smx degradation in the fe vi system fig s18 such results agree well with the zeta potential measurements fig 4d which suggest that ca2 and mg2 can significantly neutralize the negative charge of cmno2 that is ca2 and mg2 could combine with the vacancies on cmno2 and then bridge with fe vi thus causing these enhancements all in all the effects of ca2 and mg2 on smx degradation indirectly elucidate that cmno2 surface vacancies play vital roles in boosting fe vi 3 5 rapider initiation of chain reactions for efficiently generating fe iv and fe v our above work has testified the existence of the surface promoted mechanism in the cmno2 fe vi system and the activated fe vi by cmno2 possesses more vigorous electrophilic reactivity than alone fe vi considering the one electron and two electron oxidation peculiarities of fe vi it is rational to conjecture that adding micropollutants containing electron rich compounds can markedly boost fe vi decomposition thus introducing fe iv and fe v consequently fe vi consumption with adding various dosages of contaminants was monitored in fe vi and cmno2 fe vi systems in combination with fig 5 a and s14a it is presented that with the introduction of 5 μm electron rich pollutant i e smx cbz and dcf in cmno2 fe vi reaction solution fe vi consumption was elevated and the strengthening effects varied with the type of pollutants more precisely adding 5 μm smx cbz and dcf can increase fe vi loss from 10 2 μm to 27 4 26 8 and 22 7 μm respectively these promotions suggested cmno2 fe vi as the initial oxidant is still efficient to degrade smx cbz and dcf it should be noticed that when an identical dosage of pollutant is introduced into the reaction the cmno2 fe vi system always exhibited more significant fe vi decay than alone fe vi fig 5a this is because that compared with fe vi cmno2 fe vi has a higher reactivity to oxidize pollutants than fe vi thus leading to faster fe vi decomposition nevertheless electron deficient compounds i e ba atz and ibu could not induce further fe vi loss neither in fe vi system nor in the cmno2 fe vi system elucidating that fe vi and cmno2 fe vi are difficult to oxidize these compounds more importantly the interesting changes of fe vi concentration suggest that although cmno2 cannot directly react with fe vi to produce fe iv or fe v they may be generated from the oxidation of pollutants by cmno2 fe vi in the incipient reaction phase additionally owing to the high reactivity of fe iv and fe v it is believed that the newly formed fe iv and fe v as the secondary oxidants can further efficiently oxidize contaminants via electron transfer process hence fe ii and fe iii will be generated according to a previous study zhang et al illustrated that un complexed fe iii could react with fe vi and fe v to form fe v and fe iv thus improving fe vi oxidation activity zhang et al 2021 fe ii and h2o2 were also considered as the promoting reagents of fe vi luo et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 our results depicted in fig 5b certify that the three self decay products can boost fe vi to remove smx under our experimental conditions smx degradation efficiency increased from 35 4 to 65 6 64 5 and 58 8 with the addition of 30 μm fe ii fe iii and h2o2 respectively as a consequence fe vi decomposition byproducts including fe ii fe iii and h2o2 may also contribute to further activating fe vi and reinforcing the formation of fe v and fe iv in the subsequent reaction phase since phosphate is a well demonstrated complex of fe iii the impact of phosphate on pollutant degradation was revealed fig 1 b shows the lower removal ratios of smx cbz dcf siz and atn were presented in phosphate buffer than in borate buffer which demonstrates that fe iii definitely contributes to further stimulating fe vi and fostering the removal of all the tested contaminants besides negligible h2o2 was detected in the cmno2 fe vi system fig s19 suggesting that h2o2 may be consumed by high valent fe species and eventually further expedites fe vi decomposition as well as pollutant degradation collectively due to the enhanced oxidation potential of fe vi by cmno2 faster chain reactions can be triggered than alone fe vi oxidation process thus producing more self decay products to further activate fe vi in other words apart from cmno2 fe vi fe iv and fe v produced by other indirect pathways conjointly contribute to efficient purification of contaminants in the cmno2 fe vi system 3 6 comparison with reductant fe vi systems to uncover the adaptability of the cmno2 fe vi system the oxidation performance of the system and typical fe vi activation systems in diverse water environments were compared previous studies documented that the introduction of homogeneous reagents e g so3 2 s2o3 2 and hydroxylamine ha and heterogeneous catalysts e g graphene oxide go hydrochar graphene and carbon nanotubes cnts benefited in improving the dull reactivity of fe vi pan et al 2020 sun et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 fig 6 a shows that so3 2 s2o3 2 ha go hydrochar graphene and cnts can directly elevate fe vi consumption from 9 8 μm to 38 4 50 50 15 6 21 3 29 1 and 43 2 μm respectively these changes suggest all of them can perform as reductants to boost fe vi decay based on previous studies it can be known that in above reductant fe vi systems fe iv and fe v produced by in situ fe vi reduction were primarily responsible for the oxidation of contaminants pan et al 2020 sun et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 the discrepant results further demonstrate the notably different activation way between cmno2 and typical reductants in addition the catalytic capacity of cmno2 was systematically compared with the above reductants as shown in fig 6b so3 2 can promote fe vi to remove smx 81 9 while s2o3 2 and ha are detrimental towards fe vi oxidation activity under our experimental conditions this suppressive phenomenon might be associated with the immediate consumption of active oxidants by s2o3 2 and ha consequently in the practical application the competitive consumption of active oxidants between reductants and pollutants may result in low removal efficiency of hazardous substances and potentially increase fe vi dosage miao et al 2015 wang et al 2020 carbonaceous catalysts were previously employed to enhance the repeatability of reductant and expedite fe vi decay pan et al 2020 fig 6 b suggests that go hydrochar graphene and cnts can enhance the oxidation activity of fe vi and the degradation efficiency of smx increased from 39 4 to 45 3 47 0 74 7 and 85 4 respectively their catalytic performances are relatively lower than cmno2 besides degradation experiments were carried out in actual water to investigate their applicability potential in secondary effluent river water and lake water deteriorative smx degradation ratios of alone fe vi so3 2 fe vi hydrochar fe vi graphene fe vi and go fe vi systems were exhibited fig s20a e these suppressive influences may result from that much organic matter and inorganic ions can compete with smx for active oxidants in real water table s5 gratifyingly cnts coupled with fe vi oxidation process exhibited outstanding resistance to intricate water impurity fig s20f more interestingly for the cmno2 fe vi system smx removal rate significantly increased from 85 6 to 87 4 93 7 and 91 6 in secondary effluent river water and lake water respectively fig 6c which suggest there might be some particular substances e g ca2 and mg2 to stabilize the catalytic activity of cmno2 in actual water the stability of cmno2 was also examined in order to avoid the promoting effect of fe vi self decay product fe iii each life experiment rested three hours to age fe iii particles according to previous research jiang et al 2015 the cyclic performance of the cmno2 fe vi system did not decline markedly and even after five successive experiments 75 2 smx was degraded after reaction 5 min decreasing about 10 fig 6d the slight suppression is possibly caused by the competitive consumption of active species by smx degradation byproducts previous studies have reported that in contrast with the redox activation process the advanced strategy that catalyst oxidant precursors directly attack target compounds could greatly alleviate the surface corrosion of catalysts thereby maintaining catalysts long term performance ren et al 2020 ren et al 2019 moreover the unique aggregation ability of cmno2 guarantees that the potential risk of residual cmno2 is negligible as it can be removed by the coagulation process during the actual application process all the results have sought to delineate that the cmno2 fe vi system holds a great promise in real water for green oxidation although cmno2 can elevate the oxidation capacity of fe vi for removing micropollutants with electron rich moieties the cmno2 fe vi system is still sluggish to oxidize some recalcitrant contaminants therefore further research should focus on how to accelerate the elimination of stubborn pollutants by fe vi while keeping the outstanding resistance of fe vi towards natural matrix 4 conclusion for the first time this work records the promoting effect of cmno2 on the degradation of pollutants by fe vi and offers a novel protocol for producing fe iv and fe v from fe vi herein an attractive oxidation system via coupling cmno2 with fe vi is developed for efficiently removing micropollutants interestingly negligible limiting effects on the oxidation performance of the cmno2 fe vi system in actual water were observed the cmno2 fe vi system showed more excellent oxidation stability in real wastewater than several popular reductant fe vi systems additionally the cmno2 fe vi system presented a brand new strategy for fe vi activation solid evidence proved fe vi was capable of combining with cmno2 via surface vacancies to form cmno2 fe vi which showed a higher oxidation potential than alone fe vi therefore in the initial reaction phase cmno2 fe vi can react with micropollutants more rapidly to form fe iv and fe v and then fe vi can be catalyzed by the products of fe vi decomposition to further improve the reactivity of fe vi since this activation way is independent of the surface reductive sites of cmno2 it can sustainably activate fe vi and avoid the secondary pollution of cmno2 decomposition products although cmno2 with weeny particle size exhibits a low possibility for repeatable application the exciting knowledge gained in this work might encourage more researchers to explore sustainable and green materials to boost fe vi via surface promoted strategy thereby realizing long lasting fe vi activation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16147,current research focuses on introducing additional energy or reducing agents to directly accelerate the formation of fe iv and fe v from ferrate fe vi thereby ameliorating the oxidation activity of fe vi interestingly this study discovers that colloid manganese dioxide cmno2 can remarkably promote fe vi to remove various contaminants via a novel surface promoted pathway many lines of evidence suggest that high valent fe species are the primary active oxidants in the cmno2 fe vi system however the underlying activation mechanism for the direct reduction of fe vi by cmno2 to generate fe iv fe v is eliminated further analysis found that fe vi can combine with the vacancies in cmno2 to form precursor complex cmno2 fe vi which possesses a higher oxidation potential than fe vi this makes cmno2 fe vi is more vigorous to oxidize pollutants with electron rich moieties through the electron transfer step than alone fe vi resulting in producing fe v and fe iv the products of fe vi decay i e fe ii fe iii and h2o2 are revealed to play vital roles in further boosting the formation of fe iv and fe v most importantly the catalytic stability of cmno2 in complicated waters is superior to popular reductants suggesting its outstanding application potential taken together this work provides a full scale insight into the surface promoted mechanism in fe vi oxidation process thus providing an efficient and green strategy for fe vi activation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ferrate colloid manganese dioxide surface promoted sulfamethoxazole oxidation 1 introduction for meeting the requirement of clean water resources developing more eco friendly and flexible wastewater treatment technologies has set off an upsurge recently ferrate fe vi has received increasing attention in wastewater treatment by right of its aptitude in multifunctional water remediation i e chemical oxidation disinfection and coagulation hu et al 2012 talaiekhozani et al 2017 as a powerful oxidant fe vi exhibits excellent potential in efficiently degrading a wide range of micropollutants with electron rich moieties like anilines phenols and amines sharma 2011 nevertheless the effectiveness of fe vi is still inefficient for some recalcitrant compounds and highly dependent on the solution ph luo et al 2020 sharma 2010 up to now many efforts have been made to activate fe vi via forming high valent fe intermediates i e fe iv and fe v or other reactive radicals e g oh and so4 gong et al 2020 sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 it is known that compared with radical active oxidants non radical species have conspicuous virtue in resistance to inorganic ions and natural organics since of their selectivity and moderate oxidation activity duan et al 2018 terryn et al 2017 fe iv and fe v as typical non radical oxidants are reported to have 2 5 orders of magnitude more reactive than fe vi sharma et al 2022 zhu et al 2020 therefore in order to improve the sluggish reactivity of fe vi under alkaline conditions current research mainly focuses on developing promising systems to induce fe vi to produce fe iv and fe v several reducing reagents such as h2o2 nh2oh and fe2 have been explored to expedite the elimination of target contaminants via producing more fe iv and fe v luo et al 2021 shao et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 nonetheless these homogeneous reductants may show low feasibility for practical use due to their inherent defect in generating secondary pollution besides various carbonaceous materials e g biochar carbon nanotubes and graphene characterized with high efficiency and easy availability were used to activate fe vi pan et al 2020 tian et al 2020 experimental results confirmed that they execute the role of electronic sacrifices to boost the introduction of fe iv and fe v sun et al 2019 tian et al 2020 at present there is limited information regarding intensifying fe vi through other sustainable and green strategies to form fe iv and fe v colloid manganese dioxide cmno2 the product of permanganate mn vii decomposition bio catalysis of dissolved manganese and mineral weathering has been frequently found in natural and engineered waters afonso et al 2003 buffle and leppard 1995 cheng et al 2019 by right of its higher surface area than other naturally occurring types of mno2 αmno2 βmno2 γmno2 and δmno2 cmno2 is known to be the most reactive phase of mn iv in contaminant removal and catalytic oxidation reactions liu et al 2019 as a fascinating catalyst cmno2 can activate various oxidants to eliminate micropollutants and heavy metal ions yu et al 2020 zou et al 2020 for example zou et al found that the introduction of cmno2 can contribute to better oxidation efficiency of thallium i by hocl and that vacancies play a pivotal role in cmno2 catalysis cui et al 2017 besides it was reported that cmno2 formed by in situ mn vii reduction can reinforce the connection between mn vii and concerned pollutants thus improving the decontamination performance of mn vii jiang et al 2009 yu et al 2020 considering the similarity between mn vii and fe vi both of which have several high valent reactive intermediates coupling fe vi with cmno2 might be an attractive candidate to efficiently remove micropollutants therefore the objective of this work is to investigate the influence of cmno2 on fe vi oxidized organic compounds and subsequently discuss the possible activation mechanism of cmno2 to our delight cmno2 can boost fe vi to remove various micropollutants more interestingly this work comprehensively reveals that a novel surface promoted mechanism dominates the cmno2 fe vi oxidation process firstly probing experiments linear free energy relationships lfers and degradation products analysis directly or indirectly demonstrate that high valent fe species are the primary active oxidants in the cmno2 fe vi process solid evidence negates the contribution of cmno2 for direct reduction of fe vi the surface promoted mechanism is fully confirmed by in situ raman tests electrochemical analysis and galvanic oxidation process gop furthermore due to the prominent decomposition of fe vi in the presence of micropollutants with electron rich moieties we propose fe iv and fe v can be further formed from other pathways in the cmno2 fe vi process finally the practical application potential of cmno2 fe vi process was compared with representative reductant fe vi systems this work is conducive to advancing the cognition of the surface promoted mechanism in fe vi oxidation process to provide valuable guidance for developing efficient fe vi oxidation systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals various mno2 including αmno2 βmno2 γmno2 δmno2 and cmno2 were prepared the detailed preparing methods are depicted in supporting information text s1 besides potassium ferrate k2feo4 is synthesized through the wet chemical method g w thompson et al 1951 other chemicals and reagents adopted in this study are described in text s2 and s3 2 2 experimental procedure all of the degradation reactions were repeated thrice at least to obtain the average values with standard deviations shown in this paper degradation reactions were conducted in 250 ml glass beakers under magnetic stirring at 25 1 c fe vi stock solution was prepared via dissolving k2feo4 in borate buffer ph 9 0 1 0 mm initially 3 ml smx solution 250 μm and 20 mm borate buffer ph 8 0 were added in reaction solution reactions were initiated by simultaneously adding 7 5 ml cmno2 1 0 mm and 50 ml fe vi stock solution unless specified illustration the ph of the reaction solution was maintained by borate buffer and adjusted via adding sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid when needed the ph change of the reaction solution was maintained within 0 1 reaction samples quenched by hydroxylamine 1 g l 1 were collected using a syringe at specific time intervals and filtered to remove impurities other experimental procedures are described in text s4 7 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of various micropollutants were measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 usa and the detailed conditions are described in text s8 the specific flow rates mobile phases and detection wavelengths for hplc detection are listed in table s1 the initial fe vi stock concentrations were quantified by examining their absorbance at 510 nm ε 1150 m 1 cm 1 by a uv vis spectrometer sharma et al 2015 our results show that the presence of cmno2 had a negligible impact on residual fe vi and h2o2 content detection and detailed detection procedures are depicted in text s9 and s10 besides smx degradation intermediates were analyzed by an ultra hplc quadrupole time of flight premier mass spectrometer uplc qtof ms ms agilent 6500 text s11 2 4 characterization mno2 with various crystals were analyzed by x ray diffractometer xrd panalytical b v holland and the corresponding xrd results were presented in fig s1 which suggest that cmno2 is amorphous cui et al also confirmed that the additional cmno2 shows a non crystallized state cui et al 2017 the surface morphology of cmno2 was observed by transmission electron microscope tem to confirm its unordered crystal structure fig s2a the surface area and structural properties of various mno2 were analyzed by a surface area analyzer bet micromeritics asap 2460 usa the chemical states of fresh and used cmno2 were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps with an al ka anode radiation and the in situ raman tests were performed by a microscopic raman system with a 532 nm excitation laser renishaw wotton under edge uk text s12 the zeta potential of cmno2 under different conditions and the particle size of cmno2 were evaluated by a zetasizer nano zs malvern uk the diameters of cmno2 are 57 64 nm confirming that the prepared cmno2 is in the form of colloid fig s2b 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalytic performance of cmno2 the catalytic performance of cmno2 in improving fe vi reactivity was evaluated for sulfamethoxazole smx a representative antibiotic which has been frequently examined in water removal nimai et al 2020 shang et al 2020 as shown in fig 1 a the removal efficiency of smx by alone fe vi is relatively limited 39 4 and the physical absorption and chemical oxidation of cmno2 at ph 8 0 only result in less than 1 0 smx removal to our delight a significant smx degradation ratio 85 7 was obtained by coupling fe vi with cmno2 although fe vi and cmno2 fe vi systems present similar capacity for smx removal after reacting 120 min cmno2 still is a promising choose to shorten the treatment reaction fig s3 moreover the catalytic capacity of other typical mno2 like αmno2 βmno2 γmno2 and δmno2 were examined fig 1 a depicts that they are unable to activate fe vi the discrepant catalytic activity of different types of mno2 might be deciphered by the fact that cmno2 characterized with amorphous shape possesses short range order and long range disorder structure thus having more surface defects and active sites li et al 2020 among the five types of mno2 cmno2 has the maximal surface area table s2 this makes it is more likely to contact with fe vi the apparent activation energies e a for smx removal in fe vi and cmno2 fe vi systems were calculated by the arrhenius equation to get an underlying cognition about the promotion kinetics text s13 the e a of the cmno2 fe vi system for smx removal is 20 61 kj mol 1 lower than that of the fe vi oxidation process 25 56 kj mol 1 fig s4 the removal efficiencies of fe vi and cmno2 fe vi systems for diverse pollutants were determined including carbamazepine cbz diclofenac dcf sulfisoxazole siz and atenolol atn fig 1 b suggests all the tested contaminants are oxidized more expeditiously with the addition of cmno2 no matter in borate buffer or in phosphate buffer and the cmno2 induced promotion effects significantly rest with the chemical structure of organic compounds moreover the application of cmno2 is viable to activate fe vi at ph 7 0 9 0 fig s5 but the cmno2 fe vi system exhibits a lower smx removal rate at higher ph the restricted effect is likely associated with the decreasing oxidation activity of fe vi with increasing ph lee et al 2009 it is worth noting that as the initial cmno2 dosage varied from 10 to 50 μm the oxidative capacity of the cmno2 fe vi system gradually increased with further increasing the cmno2 dose invariable smx removal ratios were obtained fig s6a the corresponding fe vi consumption was examined to decipher the phenomenon preliminarily fig s6b depicts that excessive cmno2 cannot trigger further fe vi consumption generally adding a high dose of reductant will rapidly consume fe vi luo et al 2021 hence the results may indicate the reducing contribution of cmno2 in activating fe vi is negligible additionally the capacity of coupling cmno2 with other oxidants h2o2 peroxymonosulfate pms peroxydisulfate pds mn vii and periodate io4 for smx removal were analyzed fig s7 shows cmno2 h2o2 cmno2 pds cmno2 pms cmno2 mn vii and cmno2 io4 oxidation processes suggest only 1 3 2 4 4 0 2 0 and 7 9 smx removal rate at ph 8 0 after reacting 5 min respectively although previous studies have elaborated the feasibility of cmno2 for elevating the oxidation capacity of a wide variety of oxidants du et al 2020 jiang et al 2009 zhao et al 2017 inconspicuous smx degradation was shown in the above systems under our experimental conditions these results strongly demonstrate the superiority of the cmno2 fe vi system under environmentally relevant conditions for rapidly degrading smx 3 2 identification of active oxidants since fe vi decomposition will produce several intermediates radicals and non radicals may be involved in the cmno2 fe vi system some studies have reported that mno2 can catalyze h2o2 to form high active oxidants i e o2 and oh he et al 2019 therefore cmno2 might react with h2o2 derived from fe vi self decay to generate radicals for oxidation of smx it was found that the cmno2 h2o2 system possess negligible capacity for smx removal and benzoic acid ba cannot be oxidized fig s7 and s8 meaning that no radicals participated in contaminant degradation in the cmno2 fe vi process additionally lfers were constructed to further confirm the oxidation properties the pseudo first order rates of 11 kinds of representative substituted phenols sps were calculated fig s9 shows that cmno2 can promote fe vi to remove all the tested sps with high rate constants which are 1 2 6 3 fold faster than those measured in the fe vi oxidation process to describe the effect of substitution group on oxidation kinetics related rate k rel was built using 4 chlorophenol cp as a reference compound i e lg k rel log k obs k cp where k obs and k cp refer to the degradation rate constant of various sps and cp respectively good line correlations between k rel and hammett constant σ were obtained in fe vi and cmno2 fe vi systems table s3 fig 2 a and s10 generally a negative slope means such an oxidation process is a typical electrophilic reaction lee and von gunten 2012 this suggests that despite the cmno2 fe vi system with higher oxidation activity it is still sluggish to react with electron withdrawing groups it should be noticed that alone fe vi slope 1 46 was less sensitive to the substituent effects than the cmno2 fe vi process slope 0 5 which may result from the involvement of other selective oxidants in the degradation of micropollutants detailed discussion will be presented in sections 3 4 and 3 5 methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso a frequently used chemical probe of fe iv and fe v was employed to confirm their contributions in oxidizing smx rao et al 2021 as shown in fig 2b a low dose of pmso can clearly deteriorate smx degradation meanwhile the yield of methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 the characteristic product of pmso oxidized by a two electron transfer step was calculated fig s11 delineates that cmno2 significantly boosts fe vi to oxidize pmso and approximate 100 pmso2 conversion percentages were observed in fe vi and cmno2 fe vi systems these consequences may indicate that more fe iv and fe v are introduced in the cmno2 fe vi system however since the real reaction rate of fe vi with pmso in the cmno2 fe vi system is unknown the specific contribution of high valent fe species fe vi fe v and fe iv in oxidizing smx is unclear based on the present experimental results here to get an in depth understanding of the active oxidants smx degradation intermediates were analyzed by uplc qtof ms ms a total of 9 oxidation products of smx were detected in fe vi and cmno2 fe vi systems fig s12 and s13 table s4 depicts that almost identical degradation intermediates are detected in fe vi and cmno2 fe vi processes which may clarify that the two systems contain same active species since fe iv and fe v cannot change the degradation products of smx by fe vi yang et al 2021 many studies have systematically demonstrated fe vi fe v and fe iv collectively contribute to oxidizing smx in fe vi system where fe iv and fe v are the primary active oxidants luo et al 2021 wang et al 2021 taken together our present concequences indicate fe vi fe v and fe iv may jointly participate in smx removal in the cmno2 fe vi system attentively the following discussion will emphasize the critical role of other active intermediates 3 3 confirmation of the reductive contribution of cmno2 recent studies mainly focused on developing green reducing agents to in situ reduce fe vi which is a state of the art strategy to boost the formation of fe iv and fe v from fe vi feng et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 therefore cmno2 may perform as an electron donor to accelerate fe vi decomposition thus introducing more fe iv and fe v to improve the oxidation kinetics of fe vi to verify the above speculation fe vi consumption in fe vi and cmno2 fe vi systems in the absence of smx was monitored 9 8 μm fe vi was decomposed at ph 8 0 after reaction 5 min in the fe vi process fig s14a to our surprise it was marginal to elevate fe vi consumption with the addition of cmno2 10 2 μm meanwhile pre mixing experiments were carried out to further exclude the reductive role of cmno2 cmno2 and fe vi were pre mixed in the reaction solution and 5 μm smx was subsequently added after determined time intervals considering the self decay of fe vi pre mixing experiments did not last more than 5 min to avoid the influence of fe vi content change on the degradation efficiency if reductive functional groups on cmno2 surface can directly reduce fe vi smx degradation rate will dramatically decrease after the pre mixing process due to the lessened fe vi content approximately identical degradation rates were presented after pre mixing 1 min and even 5 min fig 2c the results also suggest the marginal loss of fe vi after contacting with cmno2 in the absence of smx moreover to gain an in depth comprehension of the reductive contribution of cmno2 the catalytic activity of fresh cmno2 and pre oxidized cmno2 oxidized by ozone for 1 or 2 hours were comparatively examined fig 2 d shows the smx removal efficiency of pre oxidized cmno2 coupled with fe vi system is slightly inferior to the fresh cmno2 only 4 2 inhibition effect was observed in the pre oxidized system indicating that the reducing role of cmno2 in directly introducing the formation of fe iv and fe v is not significant xps results reveal that approximate 100 mn iv are presented no matter in the fresh cmno2 or the used cmno2 after reacting five cycles fig s14b and s14c the result of mn iv content in cmno2 agrees well with previous studies which suggested that ex situ cmno2 contains few mn iii cui et al 2017 zou et al 2020 therefore no low valence mn species involves in the direct fe vi reduction in a nutshell all the consequences attempt to deny the role of cmno2 in directly promoting fe vi decomposition to produce fe iv and fe v 3 4 insights into the surface promoted mechanism the role of cmno2 in reducing fe vi is ruled out while the results of probe detection and degradation product analysis proved that high valent fe species are the active oxidants in the cmno2 fe vi system therefore cmno2 may ameliorate fe vi reactivity through another way that markedly differs from the common reduction pathway here a novel surface promoted mechanism is proposed to dominate the cmno2 fe vi system based on the recent studies catalyst surface promoting the reactivity of oxidation system mainly includes two pathways i catalyst strongly adsorbs target compound to form pollutant catalyst interface which is more readily oxidized by the selected oxidant ke et al 2021 yu et al 2020 ii oxidant can interact with the catalyst to generate highly active intermediates which possess higher oxidation potential than alone oxidant ren et al 2019 jiang et al revealed that cmno2 could not boost mn vii to remove pmso and cbz because they do not contain the functional groups to connect with cmno2 jiang et al 2009 qi et al 2021 fig 1 b and s11 show the faster pmso and cbz degradation in the cmno2 fe vi oxidation process than fe vi system suggesting that the involvement of cmno2 pollutant complex is excluded to prove the potential catalyst oxidant surface promoted mechanism in situ raman spectroscopy tests were employed to gain the direct evidence of cmno2 surface bonding to fe vi and to analyze the surface chemical evolution of cmno2 fig 3 a the raman spectra of cmno2 are featured with a strong band at the region of 574 638 cm 1 which is assigned to the stretching vibrations of mno6 octahedra cheng et al 2014 it is evident that in the presence of fe vi the raman peak intensity at 574 cm 1 relatively decreased which might be caused by the intercalation of ions via affecting the mn o vibrations perpendicular to the direction of mno6 octahedral double chains cheng et al 2014 besides fe vi presented a prominent raman peak at 800 cm 1 which is ascribed to the fe o oscillator sitter et al 1985 it should be noticed that after adding cmno2 a new peak at 783 cm 1 was detected since a smaller value of the raman peak situation represents a longer metal o bond f d hardcastle and wachs 1990 the red shift of 17 cm 1 should be attributed to the bending vibrations of the prolonged fe o bond these results strongly manifest the formation of cmno2 fe vi moreover the inconspicuous effects of ionic strength on smx degradation also verified the inner sphere surface complexation between fe vi and cmno2 fig s15 in situ electrochemical analyses were used to further testify the formation of active complex and the raised oxidation potential of fe vi by cmno2 fig 3 b shows the open circuit potential of glassy carbon electrode gce with cmno2 coating cmno2 gce immediately rises to 0 527 v after adding fe vi and then decreased upon the addition of smx it is rational to speculate that activating fe vi to produce cmno2 fe vi can enhance the cmno2 potential while the decreased potential is resulted by the redox reaction between cmno2 fe vi and smx and the decomposition of the complex in contrast the potential changes after injecting fe vi 0 475 v and smx on blank gce surface are weaker than that on cmno2 gce surface these results clearly demonstrate that the metastable precursor complex cmno2 fe vi possesses a higher oxidation potential than fe vi and is therefore more prone to oxidizing smx the results of the chronoamperometry test also support the above conclusion as shown in fig s16 the injection of fe vi and smx distinctly affected the current output which is an indurative proof to state the direct oxidation process between precursor complex and smx the current change of cmno2 gce is more significant than that of blank gce meaning that cmno2 fe vi is more active to oxidize smx moreover gop was employed to further analyze the surface promoted mechanism fe vi and pollutant were separated into two independent cells which were connected by an agar salt bridge and an ampere meter and cmno2 was coated on the platinum electrode pe fig 3c when fe vi and smx were added in fe vi cell and pollutant cell concurrently a conspicuous current was detected that rose to 33 5 μa at 0 2 min and gradually decreased to 5 5 μa at 30 min whereas the addition of fe vi and smx in blank pe cannot trigger current variation fig 3d this phenomenon fully suggested the generation of metastable active complex and smx can directly donate electron to cmno2 fe vi otherwise the current can be detected similarly cbz and dcf featured with electron rich groups also stimulated current formation fig 3d however electron deficient pollutants like ba atrazine atz and ibuprofen ibu had faint effects on the current generation due to their relatively inadequate capacity in donating electron to cmno2 fe vi fig s17 that is cmno2 fe vi still is inefficient in removing pollutants with electron deficient groups mn iii hydroxyl groups and vacancy in cmno2 are generally considered as the underlying active sites since there is scarcely any mn iii in cmno2 fig s14b mn iii cannot act as the critical site to combine with fe vi previously pms and io4 were proved to be bounded onto manganese oxide by displacing hydroxyl groups to form complex du et al 2020 huang and zhang 2019 so4 2 is an excellent alternative to replace surface hydroxyl groups zou et al 2020 so the effect of so4 2 on smx degradation was verified fig 4 a depicts that adding so4 2 has no restrictive influence on smx removal in the cmno2 fe vi system which manifests the role of surface hydroxyl is excluded cheng et al proposed that divalent cations can act as bridging constituents to connect negatively charged cmno2 with fulvic acid via ameliorating the electronegativity of cmno2 cheng et al 2019 meanwhile surface vacancies were revealed to be the adsorption sites for cmno2 to combine with divalent cations zou et al 2020 therefore if surface vacancies are the critical catalytic sites of cmno2 fe vi reactivity for smx removal can be further improved in the presence of divalent cations due to the enhanced connection between fe vi and cmno2 an interesting phenomenon that ca2 and mg2 had positive effects on smx removal in the cmno2 fe vi system was shown fig 4b and c but ca2 and mg2 cannot accelerate smx degradation in the fe vi system fig s18 such results agree well with the zeta potential measurements fig 4d which suggest that ca2 and mg2 can significantly neutralize the negative charge of cmno2 that is ca2 and mg2 could combine with the vacancies on cmno2 and then bridge with fe vi thus causing these enhancements all in all the effects of ca2 and mg2 on smx degradation indirectly elucidate that cmno2 surface vacancies play vital roles in boosting fe vi 3 5 rapider initiation of chain reactions for efficiently generating fe iv and fe v our above work has testified the existence of the surface promoted mechanism in the cmno2 fe vi system and the activated fe vi by cmno2 possesses more vigorous electrophilic reactivity than alone fe vi considering the one electron and two electron oxidation peculiarities of fe vi it is rational to conjecture that adding micropollutants containing electron rich compounds can markedly boost fe vi decomposition thus introducing fe iv and fe v consequently fe vi consumption with adding various dosages of contaminants was monitored in fe vi and cmno2 fe vi systems in combination with fig 5 a and s14a it is presented that with the introduction of 5 μm electron rich pollutant i e smx cbz and dcf in cmno2 fe vi reaction solution fe vi consumption was elevated and the strengthening effects varied with the type of pollutants more precisely adding 5 μm smx cbz and dcf can increase fe vi loss from 10 2 μm to 27 4 26 8 and 22 7 μm respectively these promotions suggested cmno2 fe vi as the initial oxidant is still efficient to degrade smx cbz and dcf it should be noticed that when an identical dosage of pollutant is introduced into the reaction the cmno2 fe vi system always exhibited more significant fe vi decay than alone fe vi fig 5a this is because that compared with fe vi cmno2 fe vi has a higher reactivity to oxidize pollutants than fe vi thus leading to faster fe vi decomposition nevertheless electron deficient compounds i e ba atz and ibu could not induce further fe vi loss neither in fe vi system nor in the cmno2 fe vi system elucidating that fe vi and cmno2 fe vi are difficult to oxidize these compounds more importantly the interesting changes of fe vi concentration suggest that although cmno2 cannot directly react with fe vi to produce fe iv or fe v they may be generated from the oxidation of pollutants by cmno2 fe vi in the incipient reaction phase additionally owing to the high reactivity of fe iv and fe v it is believed that the newly formed fe iv and fe v as the secondary oxidants can further efficiently oxidize contaminants via electron transfer process hence fe ii and fe iii will be generated according to a previous study zhang et al illustrated that un complexed fe iii could react with fe vi and fe v to form fe v and fe iv thus improving fe vi oxidation activity zhang et al 2021 fe ii and h2o2 were also considered as the promoting reagents of fe vi luo et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 our results depicted in fig 5b certify that the three self decay products can boost fe vi to remove smx under our experimental conditions smx degradation efficiency increased from 35 4 to 65 6 64 5 and 58 8 with the addition of 30 μm fe ii fe iii and h2o2 respectively as a consequence fe vi decomposition byproducts including fe ii fe iii and h2o2 may also contribute to further activating fe vi and reinforcing the formation of fe v and fe iv in the subsequent reaction phase since phosphate is a well demonstrated complex of fe iii the impact of phosphate on pollutant degradation was revealed fig 1 b shows the lower removal ratios of smx cbz dcf siz and atn were presented in phosphate buffer than in borate buffer which demonstrates that fe iii definitely contributes to further stimulating fe vi and fostering the removal of all the tested contaminants besides negligible h2o2 was detected in the cmno2 fe vi system fig s19 suggesting that h2o2 may be consumed by high valent fe species and eventually further expedites fe vi decomposition as well as pollutant degradation collectively due to the enhanced oxidation potential of fe vi by cmno2 faster chain reactions can be triggered than alone fe vi oxidation process thus producing more self decay products to further activate fe vi in other words apart from cmno2 fe vi fe iv and fe v produced by other indirect pathways conjointly contribute to efficient purification of contaminants in the cmno2 fe vi system 3 6 comparison with reductant fe vi systems to uncover the adaptability of the cmno2 fe vi system the oxidation performance of the system and typical fe vi activation systems in diverse water environments were compared previous studies documented that the introduction of homogeneous reagents e g so3 2 s2o3 2 and hydroxylamine ha and heterogeneous catalysts e g graphene oxide go hydrochar graphene and carbon nanotubes cnts benefited in improving the dull reactivity of fe vi pan et al 2020 sun et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 fig 6 a shows that so3 2 s2o3 2 ha go hydrochar graphene and cnts can directly elevate fe vi consumption from 9 8 μm to 38 4 50 50 15 6 21 3 29 1 and 43 2 μm respectively these changes suggest all of them can perform as reductants to boost fe vi decay based on previous studies it can be known that in above reductant fe vi systems fe iv and fe v produced by in situ fe vi reduction were primarily responsible for the oxidation of contaminants pan et al 2020 sun et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 the discrepant results further demonstrate the notably different activation way between cmno2 and typical reductants in addition the catalytic capacity of cmno2 was systematically compared with the above reductants as shown in fig 6b so3 2 can promote fe vi to remove smx 81 9 while s2o3 2 and ha are detrimental towards fe vi oxidation activity under our experimental conditions this suppressive phenomenon might be associated with the immediate consumption of active oxidants by s2o3 2 and ha consequently in the practical application the competitive consumption of active oxidants between reductants and pollutants may result in low removal efficiency of hazardous substances and potentially increase fe vi dosage miao et al 2015 wang et al 2020 carbonaceous catalysts were previously employed to enhance the repeatability of reductant and expedite fe vi decay pan et al 2020 fig 6 b suggests that go hydrochar graphene and cnts can enhance the oxidation activity of fe vi and the degradation efficiency of smx increased from 39 4 to 45 3 47 0 74 7 and 85 4 respectively their catalytic performances are relatively lower than cmno2 besides degradation experiments were carried out in actual water to investigate their applicability potential in secondary effluent river water and lake water deteriorative smx degradation ratios of alone fe vi so3 2 fe vi hydrochar fe vi graphene fe vi and go fe vi systems were exhibited fig s20a e these suppressive influences may result from that much organic matter and inorganic ions can compete with smx for active oxidants in real water table s5 gratifyingly cnts coupled with fe vi oxidation process exhibited outstanding resistance to intricate water impurity fig s20f more interestingly for the cmno2 fe vi system smx removal rate significantly increased from 85 6 to 87 4 93 7 and 91 6 in secondary effluent river water and lake water respectively fig 6c which suggest there might be some particular substances e g ca2 and mg2 to stabilize the catalytic activity of cmno2 in actual water the stability of cmno2 was also examined in order to avoid the promoting effect of fe vi self decay product fe iii each life experiment rested three hours to age fe iii particles according to previous research jiang et al 2015 the cyclic performance of the cmno2 fe vi system did not decline markedly and even after five successive experiments 75 2 smx was degraded after reaction 5 min decreasing about 10 fig 6d the slight suppression is possibly caused by the competitive consumption of active species by smx degradation byproducts previous studies have reported that in contrast with the redox activation process the advanced strategy that catalyst oxidant precursors directly attack target compounds could greatly alleviate the surface corrosion of catalysts thereby maintaining catalysts long term performance ren et al 2020 ren et al 2019 moreover the unique aggregation ability of cmno2 guarantees that the potential risk of residual cmno2 is negligible as it can be removed by the coagulation process during the actual application process all the results have sought to delineate that the cmno2 fe vi system holds a great promise in real water for green oxidation although cmno2 can elevate the oxidation capacity of fe vi for removing micropollutants with electron rich moieties the cmno2 fe vi system is still sluggish to oxidize some recalcitrant contaminants therefore further research should focus on how to accelerate the elimination of stubborn pollutants by fe vi while keeping the outstanding resistance of fe vi towards natural matrix 4 conclusion for the first time this work records the promoting effect of cmno2 on the degradation of pollutants by fe vi and offers a novel protocol for producing fe iv and fe v from fe vi herein an attractive oxidation system via coupling cmno2 with fe vi is developed for efficiently removing micropollutants interestingly negligible limiting effects on the oxidation performance of the cmno2 fe vi system in actual water were observed the cmno2 fe vi system showed more excellent oxidation stability in real wastewater than several popular reductant fe vi systems additionally the cmno2 fe vi system presented a brand new strategy for fe vi activation solid evidence proved fe vi was capable of combining with cmno2 via surface vacancies to form cmno2 fe vi which showed a higher oxidation potential than alone fe vi therefore in the initial reaction phase cmno2 fe vi can react with micropollutants more rapidly to form fe iv and fe v and then fe vi can be catalyzed by the products of fe vi decomposition to further improve the reactivity of fe vi since this activation way is independent of the surface reductive sites of cmno2 it can sustainably activate fe vi and avoid the secondary pollution of cmno2 decomposition products although cmno2 with weeny particle size exhibits a low possibility for repeatable application the exciting knowledge gained in this work might encourage more researchers to explore sustainable and green materials to boost fe vi via surface promoted strategy thereby realizing long lasting fe vi activation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16148,due to the pivotal role of ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface enhanced visible light assisted biodegradation of tetracycline tc in anoxic system was realized through both batch experiment and long term operation in this study the results of the batch experiment elucidated that 50 mg l 1 tc could be completely removed within 10 h in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system the continuous flow experiment was operated for 75 d to evaluate the performance and stability of ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system tc removal efficiency in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system was as high as 92 4 1 6 at influent tc concentration of 50 mg l 1 tc and hydraulic retention time hrt of 10 h which would be attributed to the promoted separation of photoholes and photoelectrons at the presence of nitrate as electron acceptor facilitated electron transfer between semiconductor and biofilm was beneficial for enhancing tc biodegradation thus lowering toxicity of intermediate products and promoting microbial activity moreover the species related to tc biodegradation rhodopseudomonas phreatobacter and stenotrophomonas denitrification thauera and electron transfer delftia were enriched at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface besides a possible mechanism involved in enhanced tc degradation and nitrogen removal at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface was proposed this study provided a novel and promising strategy to enhance recalcitrant tc removal from industrial wastewater graphical abstract enhanced degradation mechanism of ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system was proposed image graphical abstract keywords tetracycline ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface electron transfer denitrification microbial community 1 introduction tetracycline tc which is a typical antibiotic is widely used for the control of disease and bacterial infection in humans and animals zhang et al 2011 the discharge of wastewater containing tc into water environment can cause serious threat to environment and human health therefore it is necessary to take targeted treatment of wastewater containing tc biological treatment has turned out to be a preferred technique in wastewater treatment which has the merits of low energy consumption and environmental friendly as compared to physical and chemical methods wang et al 2020a 2021 molecular oxygen often served as electron acceptors to degrade tc under aerobic condition in biological system liao et al 2021 unfortunately aerobic biodegradation could not completely metabolize recalcitrant contaminants such as tc due to the lack of related enzymes although at the expense of high cost consumption due to blast diffusion aeration pan et al 2019 it has been demonstrated that anaerobic treatment as the favorable method could remove organic contaminants via several biodegradation steps by microbial communities such as hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis xu et al 2018a however under the stress of pollutant toxicity the anaerobic biodegradation was often limited by the slow electron transfer and lack of electron acceptors wang et al 2020a recently anoxic treatment based on the biodegradation at the presence of various electron acceptors has attracted increasing attention wang et al 2020a our previous study testified that nitrate as the electron acceptors could enhance anoxic biodegradation of various recalcitrant contaminants such as pyridine hou et al 2018 n methylpyrrolidone nmp wang et al 2019 and n n dimethylformamide dmf wang et al 2020a however anoxic denitrification process related to tc biodegradation was negligible due to its bacteriostasis and poor biodegradability wen et al 2012 zheng et al 2016 tc has a significantly negative effect on biological gas production at the concentration as low as 250 μg l 1 indicating that respiratory metabolism process was rather sensitive to tc hou et al 2016 therefore anoxic biodegradation of tc at the presence of nitrate deserved to be developed in order to remove tc at high concentration recently photogenerated holes oh o2 or other reactive oxidative species were widely investigated to catalyze redox reaction which could transform bio recalcitrant contaminants on semiconductor materials surface via light excitation shi et al 2020 semiconductor materials surface could serve as both electron acceptors or donors to transfer electron from or to contaminants resulting the degradation of recalcitrant contaminants dong et al 2020 electron transfer could be accelerated at the semiconductor interface and it is proved to be feasible to improve the oxidation ability of semiconductor as electron acceptors de araújo et al 2017 liu et al 2020 accelerated degradation of recalcitrant compounds was rather helpful for the reduce of pollutant toxicity promotion of microbial activity and relieving the restriction on microbial respiratory electron transport chain xiong et al 2018 thus it could be inferred that recalcitrant contaminants such as tc could be transformed to easily biodegradable intermediates on semiconductor interface which could be easily utilized by microorganisms jiao et al 2008 in addition nitrate which was a highly efficient electron acceptor could play a key role in electron transfer at semiconductor and microorganism interface therefore it could be hypothesized that integrating semiconductor microorganism with nitrate should be feasible for the treatment of wastewater containing recalcitrant contaminants the coupled semiconductor microorganism nitrate interface would provide a new approach to effectively utilize light energy to drive chemical transformation and accelerate microbial metabolism under anoxic condition the electron transfer system based on light excited semiconductor microorganism nitrate provided a promising prospect for enhanced degradation of bio inhibitory contaminants yu et al 2020 however the construction of light assisted biodegradation system to enhance tc degradation at semiconductor microorganism nitrate interface has been rarely reported furthermore the feasibility of long term operation the influence of key parameters the variation of microbial community and the underlying degradation mechanism were still unclear therefore this study investigated the feasibility and stability of semiconductor microorganism nitrate interface for the enhanced light assisted biodegradation of tc in anoxic condition through both batch and continuous experiments considering that microorganisms could be damaged under ultraviolet light the xenon lamp is used to simulate visible light porous polyurethane material was used as a carrier for both semiconductor and microorganism the outer surface of the carrier was coated by the semiconductor ag tio2 with visible light response and the inner surface was attached by biofilm tc removal performance without and with nitrate was evaluated under various operation strategies in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface system the effect of crucial factor i e nitrate concentration tc concentration and hrt and long terms operation on the performance of continuous reactor was investigated further toxicity bioactivity and microbial community structure was also elucidated the possible mechanism of light assisted biodegradation referred to enhanced tc removal at the ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface was proposed 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation of ag tio2 semiconductor and coating procedure ag tio2 semiconductor which has the visible light response was prepared according to xiong et al 2018 the detailed preparation procedure was described in the text s1 titanium tetraisopropoxide ti och ch3 2 4 aladdin industrial co shanghai china and silver nitrate agno3 sinopharm chemical reagent co shanghai china were used as precursors of titania and silver respectively sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate c6h5na3 2h2o sinopharm chemical reagent co shanghai china was served as the reducing agent the coating of ag tio2 semiconductor onto porous polyurethane was performed according to dong et al 2016 the detailed procedure was depicted in the text s2 the characterization of ag tio2 semiconductor synthesized was described in text s3 2 2 reactor configuration synthetic wastewater and inocula the schematic diagram of the light assisted biodegradation reactor was depicted in fig s1 the reactor was a rectangular cylinder made of perspex glass with length of 5 cm width of 5 cm and height of 15 cm and the total working volume was 375 ml in order to improve the light transmittance the illuminated side was made of quartz glass the reactor was divided into two compartments to avoid collision between the porous sponge carrier and the rotor through a baffle with hole array installed at the 2 cm from bottom porous polyurethane carriers were stirred in the reactor by magnetic stirring the 300 w xenon lamp with a uv light filter was used as the visible light source and was installed beside the light assisted biodegradation

water system to prevent thermal catalytic effects the cuboidal polyurethane carriers fangdou science and technology ltd kunshan china with side length of 1 cm porosity of 89 and density of 0 1 g ml 1

aerated with nitrogen gas n2 for 10 min to remove dissolved oxygen 2 3 experimental protocols to evaluate the feasibility of light assisted biodegradation of tc batch experiment was conducted in the

reactor through gravity flow the experiment period of rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate was divided into four phases and the operation condition for each phase were summarized in table 1 in phase i in order to investigate the effect of nitrate dosage on tc degradation no3 n concentration in the influent of rlight cata bio nitrate was increased from 0 to 50 mg l 1 at hrt of 10 h with tc and acetate concentration in the influent controlled at 50 mg l 1 and 500 mg l 1 respectively the control reactor rlight cata bio was operated without nitrate in phase ii the effect of influent tc

photoelectron spectra xps were obtained using an escalab 250 thermo fisher scientific usa with al ka radiation at 1486 8 v toxicity variation during long terms operation was analyzed according to xu et al 2018b the activity of total adenosine triphosphate atp was detected according to the manufacturer s specification of kit jianglai biological china free radical species scavenging test according to shi et al 2020 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was analyzed using fto conducting glass coated by ag tio2 on an electrochemical workstation the impedance data was fitted to an equivalent electrical circuit using zview software linear sweep voltammograms lsv were analyzed within the range from 0 5 to 1 2 v the microstructure of the biofilm was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 250feg fei usa with the biofilm sample pretreated according to xiong et al 2018 2 5 bacterial community analysis and gene function prediction three sludge samples were collected for bacterial community analysis namely seed sludge the initial seed sludge slulight cata bio and slulight cata bio nitrate which were collected from rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate at the end of phase iv the genomic dna of each sample was extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil for high throughput sequencing the v3 v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with the primers 338f 5 acctcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 on the polymerase chain reaction system the sequence of purified amplicons was determined on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china furthermore phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states 2 picrust2 which was an improved approach for metagenome inference was used to predict the potential functions of microbial community picrust2 analysis was performed based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced tc removal in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system 3 1 1 tc removal performances under different operation conditions in order to testify the feasibility of ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system for enhanced light assisted tc biodegradation tc removal performances in ten systems were compared as demonstrated in fig 1 tc was slightly removed in both rcon and rcon nitrate with tc concentration decreased slightly from 52 8 2 1 and 51 7 1 9 mg l 1 to 47 8 0 6 and 46 9 1 3 mg l 1 within 10 h respectively the inappreciable tc removal indicated that the contribution of tc removal due to absorption was limited in both systems with or without nitrate the slight difference between rcon and rcon nitrate indicated that adsorption of tc could not be significantly affected by nitrate rlight showed similar tendency with rcon with tc concentration decreased from 53 8 2 3 mg l 1 to 45 5 0 9 indicating that sole photolysis could not effectively remove tc tc concentration of rlight nitrtate decreased from 49 7 0 9 to 40 7 0 7 mg l 1 within 10 h when tc removal efficiency in rlight nitrate was 3 higher compared with rlight probably due to the promoted photolysis of tc at the presence of nitrate nitrate could act as photosensitizer for tc photolysis because nitrate excited by light irradiation could form nitrogen reactive species nrs and reactive oxygen species ros nélieu et al 2009 tc concentration in rbio slightly decreased from 51 3 1 7 mg l 1 to 43 5 0 12 mg l 1 within 10 h which was close to those in both rcon and rcon nitrate this result indicated that tc removal through sole biodegradation was also limited probably due to toxicity and recalcitrance of tc bílková et al 2019 in contrast tc concentration in rbio nitrate decreased obviously from 50 1 1 4 to 34 6 0 9 mg l 1 within 10 h compared with rbio tc removal was enhanced with removal efficiency 12 5 higher for rbio nitrate indicating that nitrate as the electron acceptor could be beneficial for tc biodegradation organic contaminant could be transformed more easily with the supply of available electron acceptor such as nitrate through which electron produced from contaminant oxidation could be consumed rapidly through microbial metabolism wang et al 2020a tc removal performance in rlight cata and rlight cata nitrate were obviously improved as illustrated by tc concentration decreased rapidly from initial 49 7 0 8 and 52 1 1 7 mg l 1 to 23 6 0 7 and 18 7 2 4 mg l 1 within 2 h and then further decreased to 18 0 9 and 12 5 0 9 mg l 1 within 10 h respectively the decrease of tc concentration indicated that ag tio2 semiconductor could drive tc degradation under visible light particularly tc removal in rlight cata nitrate was about 12 higher compared with rlight cata which could be attributed to the catalysis on semiconductor interface especially at the presence of nitrate ag tio2 nitrate interface might improve catalytic capacity for tc degradation probably through acceleration of charge transfer liu et al 2020 in addition low concentration of anions such as nitrate promoted adsorption capacity of tc on semiconductor surface by reducing intermolecular repulsive forces which was consistent with zhang et al 2020b tc concentration in rlight cata bio ultimately decreased from 50 4 1 9 to 9 8 0 3 mg l 1 with the concentration decreased in rlight cata bio high than the sum of rlight cata and rbio indicating the synergistic effect between ag tio2 and biofilm under visible light biodegradation of tc intermediates produced from semiconductor catalysis could enhance the utilization of light energy for tc decomposing xiong et al 2018 besides electron transfer from semiconductor to microbe was helpful for the promotion of organic contaminant degradation ding et al 2018 shi et al 2020 notably rather excellent tc removal performance was demonstrated in rlight cata bio nitrate with tc concentration declined rapidly from 51 6 2 3 to 6 8 1 6 mg l 1 in the initial 1 h and further decline to 0 mg l 1 within 1 5 h compare with rlight cata nitrate and rlight cata bio complete tc removal within reaction time as short as 1 5 h in rlight cata bio nitrate indicated that nitrate could promote synergy between ag tio2 and biofilm at the interface moreover the removal profiles under different operation conditions were fitted according to first order kinetics as indicated by fig 1 and table s1 the first order removal rates k of the degradation systems with nitrate were generally greater than those without nitrate particularly the removal rate of rlight cata bio nitrate was as high as 2 53 h 1 versus 1 75 h 1 for rlight cata bio in the photocatalysis microbe system where the ag tio2 was used as the semiconductor material developed tc removal rate was as low as 0 59 h 1 probably due to the absence of nitrate xiong et al 2017 ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system developed in this study was relatively efficient in terms of tc removal confirming the key role of nitrate in tc degradation 3 1 2 performance of tc degradation in continuous experiment process the effect of key operation parameters i e no3 n concentration initial tc concentration and hrt on tc removal was rather crucial to achieve a feasible strategy for biosystem operation with the no3 n concentration increased gradually from initial 0 mg l 1 to 20 mg l 1 tc removal efficiency increased obviously from 45 4 2 4 to 91 6 6 1 fig 2 a however with the no3 n concentration further increased to 50 mg l 1 tc removal efficiency decreased to 62 2 0 8 suggesting the inhibition of tc removal at high no3 n dosage similar phenomenon was observed in tc photodegradation system by chen et al 2017 where tc removal rate decreased by 14 97 at no3 concentration higher than 0 05 mol l 1 due to the enlarged electrostatic repulsive force at the presence of high dosage nitrate lado ribeiro et al 2019 indicated that no3 n at high concentration could be adsorbed on the semiconductor surface competing for the active sites with the target contaminants furthermore excess nitrate plays a role of scavenger to consume photoholes and active free radical species generated on semiconductor payan et al 2019 it was worth noting that deteriorated tc removal performance at no3 n concentration of 50 mg l 1 was still higher than that rlight cata bio unlike tc removal toc removal efficiency increased gradually from 13 5 2 4 to 67 4 2 1 as the increase of no3 n concentration from 0 mg l 1 to 50 mg l 1 which could be attributed to the denitrification process via nitrate at related high concentration in our previous study mineralization efficiency of refractory compounds such as pyridine was significantly enhanced at the presence of nitrate indicating that nitrate as electron acceptor play a key role in simultaneous removal of pyridine and nitrogen hou et al 2018 influent concentration of recalcitrant contaminants should have an appreciable impact on reactor performance ou et al 2016 as indicated in fig 2b the reactor performance was remained relatively steady even when initial tc concentration increased from 20 mg l 1 to 50 mg l 1 as shown by slightly decreased tc and toc removal efficiency in rlight cata bio nitrate from 96 1 3 4 and 67 7 0 9 to 92 3 1 1 and 65 3 2 3 respectively however with the further increase of initial tc concentration to 100 mg l 1 tc and toc removal efficiency were sharply decreased to 58 3 3 8 and 50 6 4 1 respectively noteworthy deterioration of rlight cata bio nitrate performance in terms of tc and toc removal could be attributed to the reduced microbial activity at the presence of high concentration antibacterial tc lee et al 2020 however with initial tc concentration increased from 20 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 tc and toc concentration in rlight cata bio was decreased sharply from 85 7 1 8 and 65 9 0 8 to 29 9 2 3 and 25 6 1 7 respectively similar inhibition due to high tc dosage on microbial activity was widely reported chen et al 2016 dong et al 2016 niu et al 2013 reactor performance of rlight cata bio nitrate were much better than rlight cata bio especially at high tc dosage which was consistent with the profile described in fig 1 from these results the influent tc concentration in rlight cata bio nitrate should be controlled at 50 mg l 1 in order to maintain optimal removal efficiency for reactor operation for the practical treatment of wastewater containing toxic contaminants such as tc hrt should be adjusted properly in order to keep a proper loading rate wu et al 2018 as indicated in fig 2c as hrt decreased from 24 h to 6 h tc and toc removal efficiency in rlight cata bio decreased from 53 8 4 9 and 54 9 2 4 to 39 6 4 2 and 43 7 1 0 respectively however with the decrease of hrt from 24 h to 10 h tc removal efficiency in rlight cata bio nitrate decreased slightly from 94 1 2 5 to 92 9 1 9 respectively proving the efficient removal performance in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system when hrt was further decreased to 6 h tc removal efficiency was decreased to 62 6 1 8 which was still obviously higher than that in rlight cata bio correspondingly toc removal in rlight cata bio nitrate have been weakly affected with hrt decreased from 24 h to 6 h as displayed by the slight decrease of toc removal efficiency from 74 5 0 9 on 24 h to 65 8 1 4 on 10 h and then to 50 4 2 1 on 6 h therefore hrt of rlight cata bio nitrate was controlled at 10 h in the following study the stability of the biosystem during long term operation is of the primary concern to achieve the practical application considering the semiconductor photocorrosion and toxicity of tc long term operation performance deserved to be investigated to estimate the stability of ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate was operated in parallel from day 91 to day 165 at influent tc concentration of 50 mg l 1 and hrt of 10 h as indicated in fig 2d tc removal efficiencies in rlight cata bio nitrate increased slightly from 90 1 on day 91 to 93 8 on day 165 which was significantly higher than those in rlight cata bio above 40 correspondingly toc removal efficiency in rlight cata bio nitrate was always higher than 63 while toc removal efficiency in rlight cata bio was obviously below 50 tc removal efficiency based on ternary bivo4 ag cu2o nanocomposites was about 91 22 which was comparable with this study deng et al 2017 these results demonstrated that ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system could maintain a long term stable performance in terms of tc and toc removal indicating that rlight cata bio nitrate would have a huge potential for enhanced removal of recalcitrant organics from real wastewater 3 2 tc degradation intermediates and possible degradation pathway in order to reveal the possible tc degradation pathway the intermediate products in rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate were recognized by hplc ms spectrometer table s2 and fig s4 in rlight cata bio m1 m2 m3 m6 m7 m8 m9 m13 m14 m15 and m20 of intermediates were identified more product categories were detected in rlight cata bio nitrate including m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 m8 m9 m10 m11 m12 m13 m14 m15 m16 m17 m18 m19 m20 m22 m23 m24 and m25 the mutual products in both rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate were m1 m2 m3 m8 m9 m13 m14 m15 and m20 m1 m2 m3 m8 and m13 as the main intermediate products of tc degradation was also observed in other literatures cai et al 2020 xiong et al 2018 yang et al 2018 where tc transformation was catalyzed by semiconductor under light it is interesting to note that products including m4 m5 m10 m11 m12 m16 m17 m18 m19 m21 m22 m23 m24 and m25 was only observed in rlight cata bio nitrate speculating that more complicated reactions occurred in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system in addition m4 m5 m10 and m11 was also produced in other photocatalysis systems with the irradiation by excited nitrate chen et al 2016 huang et al 2018 xu et al 2020 yang et al 2018 indicating that nitrate played a significant role in tc transformation in photocatalysis systems based on the above intermediates analysis possible pathway for enhanced tc degradation in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system was proposed fig 3 firstly tc was transformed to the intermediates with four rings including m1 m2 m3 m4 and m5 through hydroxylation dehydroxylation demethylation dehydration carboxylation and bond cleavage these intermediates could be resulted from the oxidative transformation of tc by various oxidative species such as photoholes hydroxyl radical species etc xiong et al 2018 2017 xu et al 2020 subsequently these intermediates with four rings were further oxidized to m8 m9 m10 m11 and m12 through the deprivation of methyl formyl hydroxyl and amino groups resulting into the formation of m13 m14 m15 m16 m17 m18 and m19 similar conversion process was proposed in other visible light driven system for tc degradation zhu et al 2017 as is well known complete contaminant degradation can be limited by the mineralization ability of semiconductor catalysis wang et al 2011 the produced intermediates with three rings via the destruction of 4 ring structure compound could be further oxidized by microorganisms therefore m20 m22 m23 m24 and m25 were formed through the cleavage of c c bond and benzene ring structure hydroxylation and carboxylation and then final mineralization occurred to produce h2o and co2 compared with rlight cata bio successive hydroxylation reaction in rlight cata bio nitrate was rather crucial in tc degradation which could be attributed to promotion of oxidation ability at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface besides intermediates with four rings namely m6 and m7 were obviously accumulated in rlight cata bio which were relatively stable at semiconductor interface probably due to the lack of oxidative species in rlight cata bio he et al 2014 the generated intermediates i e m6 and m7 in rlight cata bio would be rather recalcitrant and difficult to be further mineralized through microbial metabolism the above intermediates and pathway analysis concluded that ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface not only promoted the oxidation process in intermediate transformation but also facilitated the further decomposition of intermediates through anoxic respiration process at the presence of nitrate eem was measured to analyze chemical characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom during tc degradation process further elucidating tc degradation pathway as indicated in fig s5 the two apparent fluorophores in the influent of both rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate were identified at excitation emission ex em wavelength of 350 520 nm and 400 520 nm in region v which was related to humic acid like substances obvious migration of fluorophores to ex em 275 520 nm in effluent were observed corresponding to fulvic acid like substances which was located in region v implying that tc was efficiently transformed coincidentally similar shift was also observed in bioi ag agi catalyzed system for tc degradation yang et al 2018 where this migration was thought to be related to the decomposition of polycyclic aromatic moieties other major fluorescence peaks of rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate were severally assigned to humic acid like humic acids fulvic acids tryptophan and protein like in regions v iii ii and iv which were typical biomass associated products ni et al 2011 shao et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 specially the production of humic acid like substance was accompanied by the decomposition of macromolecular organic such as ciprofloxacin tetracycline zhang et al 2018 in various degradation process humic acid could accelerate the energy and electron transfer zhang et al 2019 the fluorescence intensities of the peaks observed in rlight cata bio nitrate were higher than those in rlight cata bio indicating that microorganisms in rlight cata bio nitrate consumed more organic substances through respiration metabolism which was consistent with efficient tc removal in rlight cata bio nitrate microorganism metabolism would result in the secretion of various dissolved organic matters such as humic acid and protein like matter according to eem analysis more humic acid tryptophan protein like matter and aromatic protein substances could be generated in rlight cata bio nitrate than rlight cata bio indicating higher microbial activity in rlight cata bio nitrate the tryptophan protein and humic acid substances generated from microbial metabolism during tc biodegradation process could contribute to stability of biological system as well as microbial activity especially in the denitrification process he et al 2018 in addition extracellular electron transfer among bacteria could be promoted by dissolved organic matters such as humic acid substances as the electron shuttles as well bacterial cell growth could be promoted by the dissolved organic matters especially for proteobacteria phylum li et al 2022 3 3 fabrication of ag tio2 biofilm interface formation of biofilm and stability of ag tio2 coated should play a pivotal role in the successful fabrication of ag tio2 biofilm interface fig s6 depicted sem images of inner and external of the porous carriers used in both rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate to evaluate the special distribution of semiconductor and microorganisms prior to operation ag tio2 was coated tightly with the interior and exterior surface of the polyurethane carriers fig s6a and b at the end of phase iv for the polyurethane carriers taken from both rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate ag tio2 was still tightly attached on the exterior surface without obvious loss fig s6c and d indicating that ag tio2 coating on polyurethane carriers were quite stable in ag tio2 biofilm system after long term operation additionally few microorganism cells were observed on the exterior surface coated by ag tio2 probably due to the toxicity stimulation by tc and semiconductor induced damage i e photogenerated holes and active free radical dong et al 2016 in contrast obvious biofilm was observed in the interior pores of polyurethane carriers taken from both rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate fig s6e and f the growth of biofilm could be attributed to the fact that rough surface of polyurethane carriers coated by ag tio2 provided attachment sites for microorganisms compared with the sparse and nonuniform biofilm observed in rlight cata bio the biofilm in rlight cata bio nitrate obviously presented dense and tight structure microorganisms was enriched to fabricate biofilm in rlight cata bio nitrate where the biomass was significantly higher than that in rlight cata bio the thick biofilm observed in rlight cata bio nitrate could be helpful for the protection of the microbes inside against toxicity persecution especially for the species with a long growth period 3 4 functionalized microbial community in ag tio2 biofilm system microbial community analysis of the seed sludge and the biofilm in rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate after long term operation was carried out the microbial diversity of rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate were relatively lower as compared with seed sludge which could be attributed to the inhibition and selection role of tc and oxidative species in ag tio2 biofilm system table s3 as indicated in fig 4 a chloroflexi 22 31 proteobacteria 19 78 firmicutes 17 38 bacteroidetes 13 00 deinococcus thermus 8 41 and ignavibacteriae 5 87 were the dominant bacterial phyla in seed sludge which were reported to be the typical microbial species in biological wastewater treatment system ou et al 2016 the contrastive analysis of three samples reflected that bacterial species were severely reduced in ag tio2 biofilm system i e the major phyla were only proteobacteria 88 12 and 91 91 and bacteroidetes 11 86 and 6 90 in rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate respectively this result indicated that selective enrichment of function species could be induced under environment stress such as tc toxicity and light stimulation in addition both proteobacteria and bacteroidetes have been found to survive well in other tc degradation system lan et al 2020 su et al 2020 further analysis of community structure at the genus level was shown in fig 4b the species such as truepera 8 40 clostridium 6 63 trichococcus 5 56 arenimonas 5 00 filimonas 3 79 and thiobacillis 2 86 were found to be dominated in the seed sludge however these species have completely lost dominance in both rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate probably because of their poor adaptability in rlight cata bio rhodopseudomonas 65 73 delftia 14 67 macellibacterium 9 67 and bosea 2 10 were found to be dominant the most dominant species in rlight cata bio nitrate were rhodopseudomonas delftia thauera phreatobacter and stenotrophomonas with relative abundances of 68 20 8 86 4 84 1 82 and 1 48 respectively rhodopseudomonas which was a typical photosynthetic species could be used to degrade various polycyclic aromatic compounds at high concentration wu et al 2019 additionally rhodopseudomonas had excellent tolerance to toxic chemicals such as antibiotics and herbicides wu et al 2020 delftia which was capable of utilizing organic compounds as electron donors was an exoelectrongens which was beneficial for extracellular electron transfer he et al 2020 macellibacterium could utilize glucose to produce volatile fatty acids through fermentation in anaerobic metabolism system jabari et al 2012 bosea was found to be resistant to multiple antibiotics which was often found in the microbial community of other system treating wastewater containing tc low et al 2016 thauera was reported to be able to achieve the cleavage of the aromatic ring as well as a denitrifier xiong et al 2018 the strong correlation of resistance gene with thauera would facilitate the denitrifying process using tc as electron donor and carbon source at low dissolved oxygen concentration wang et al 2020b zou et al 2020 phreatobacter could be resistant to strong oxidants such as hydroxyl radical and effectively utilize organic substrates choi et al 2019 stenotrophomonas could utilize aromatic hydrocarbon contaminations as sole carbon source for denitrification bashandy et al 2020 in addition the abundances of functional species namely rhodopseudomonas thauera phreatobacter and stenotrophomonas in rlight cata bio nitrate was significantly higher than those in rlight cata bio speculating that the nitrate assisted the enrichment of functional species as electron acceptors in addition the presence of nitrate promoted further degradation of tc intermediates resulting into the enrichment of functional species related to nitrification interestingly the abundance of delftia associated with electron transport was relatively low in rlight cata bio nitrate as compared with rlight cata bio probably due to the direct electron transfer at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface reducing the dependence on electroactive species the enrichment of rhodopseudomonas delftia thauera phreatobacter and stenotrophomonas in rlight cata bio nitrate would contribute the high removal efficiency of tc and toc in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system 3 5 microbial activity and toxicity variation atp could be used as a crucial indicator to evaluate the microbial activity in biological metabolism velasco alvarez et al 2011 as demonstrated in fig 5 a the atp content in rlight cata bio decreased from 0 80 0 11 µmol l 1 on day 50 to 0 49 0 04 µmol l 1 on day 165 however the atp content in rlight cata bio nitrate increased from 0 90 0 06 µmol l 1 on day 50 to 1 2 0 03 µmol l 1 on day 165 it was indisputable that more atp was synthesized in rlight cata bio nitrate probably due to the fact that organic substrates could be thoroughly decomposed at the presence of nitrate nitrate was responsible for electron transfer to accelerate the biological respiration for atp generation wang et al 2020a meanwhile the high atp activity could promote secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps to defense cell destruction from toxic substance xiong and liu 2010 which could be indicated by the thick biofilm observed in sem images fig s6 the accumulation of tryptophan protein like matter and aromatic protein in rlight cata bio nitrate reflected the intense microbial activity in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system the increase of atp activity in rlight cata bio nitrate was consistent with the high tc and toc removal as well as the high microbial diversity in rlight cata bio nitrate similar phenomenon was also observed in a photo assisted biodegradation system for sulfamethoxazole removal where the increase of atp content inferred the fast biomass growth high toc removal efficiency and increased living cells liu et al 2022 this profile of atp variation was similar to ailijiang et al 2016 where the increased metabolic activity resulted in enhancement of phenol removal rate effluent from antibiotic wastewater treatment could cause adverse toxic effects on aqueous environments and human health the potential toxicity of tc and tc products might have a significant impact for microbial metabolism xu et al 2018b as demonstrated in fig 5b the relative inhibition ratios in rlight cata bio nitrate decreased from 39 8 3 6 on day 50 to 22 4 2 9 on day 165 which was obviously lower than those in rlight cata bio the low relative inhibition ratio was consistent with the low residual tc and toc in rlight cata bio nitrate indicating that the toxic tc and its degradation intermediates could be decomposed efficiently in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system the high inhibition ratio in rlight cata bio was consistent with the high residual of tc and the obvious accumulation of intermediates such as m6 and m7 niu et al 2013 evaluated the toxicity of tc intermediates by p phosphoreum and found that sloughed groups such as n methyl from tc and its intermediates increased the toxicity due to the lowered steric resistance and improved penetration into cell 3 6 electron transfer and active oxidative species at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface several active oxidative species such as h oh and o2 could be produced on semiconductor under light which could be used to catalyze oxidation for tc degradation as depicted in fig 6 a no obvious change in terms of tc removal efficiency could be observed in both rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate with the addition of o2 scavenger namely 1 4 benzoquinone bq indicating that the contribution of o2 for tc removal was negligible the relatively low concentration of dissolved oxygen in both rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate could be another reason for this result tc removal efficiency of rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate was slightly decreased to 74 7 3 52 and 89 78 4 37 respectively when oh scavenger namely isopropanol ipa was added however when photohole scavenger namely potassium iodide ki was added into both reactors serious suppression of tc removal appeared as indicated by the sharp decrease of tc removal efficiency to 45 12 7 93 and 51 2 5 45 in rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate therefore it could be inferred that photoholes were the main active species responsible for tc degradation rather than o2 and oh in this study aromatic ring compounds such as benzene could be attacked more easily by electron deficient electrophiles such as photoholes ji et al 2018 however about 50 of tc was still removed in rlight cata bio nitrate when photoholes were quenched although the removal performance was relatively poor this result indicated that tc could be removed in multiple ways such as biodegradation photodegradation and adsorption biodegradation could play a key role in tc removal especially at the presence of nitrate as the electron acceptor the key role of the photoholes in tc removal indicated that the photoelectrons could be consumed efficiently on ag tio2 semiconductor by nitrate at the presence of microbe on the special structure of interface at the presence of nitrate enhanced photohole electron pair separation could be achieved through the facilitated photoelectron transfer to nitrate resulting the efficient oxidation of organic compounds by photoholes similar phenomenon was also observed in bivo4 feooh semiconductor microbe biohybrid system by shi et al 2020 where photoelectrons at light excited was transferred to biofilm for enhanced pyridine degradation in order to investigate the performance of charge transmission at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and linear sweep voltammetry were performed as shown by smaller arc radius at both low frequency and high frequency fig 6b charge transfer resistance in rlight cata bio nitrate was significantly lower than those in rbio rbio nitrate rlight cata rlight cata nitrate and rlight cata bio indicating the enhanced separation of photoelectron photohole pairs and the transmission of photoelectrons at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface the increase of the charge transfer resistance at low frequency was observed in rlight cata bio suggesting that photoelectrons produced could not be transmitted efficiently to the biofilm compared with rlight cata bio nitrate the charge transfer resistance at high frequency in rlight cata nitrate was increased indicating that semiconductor biofilm interface was beneficial for photoelectron transport hence the charge transfer resistance was weakened at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface which could be attributed to the fact that the photoelectrons could be consumed easily by the attached biofilm at the presence of nitrate as the electron acceptor zhang et al 2020a indicated that the smaller arc radius represented the increased interfacial electron transport and electrical conductivity which could be attributed to the electron transfer channel formed at semiconductor interface furthermore linear sweep voltammetry further revealed the capability of electron conduction and interfacial electron transfer in rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate fig 6c the current density in rlight cata bio nitrate 0 095 ma cm 2 was much higher than that in rlight cata bio 0 017 ma cm 2 at potential of 1 2 v as indicated by zhou et al 2018 the current density in n tio2 biofilm interface was increased largely as compared to biofilm interface which was consistent with this study yan et al 2015 found that photocurrent was prone to transferring to the electrolyte rather than retaining on the semiconductor nitrate in the electrolyte could be easily utilized as the electron acceptor to facilitate charge transfer from semiconductor which could be the main reason for relatively high current density and low charge transfer resistance in rlight cata bio nitrate 3 7 mechanism for enhanced tc removal at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface to sum up the possible synergistic mechanism for enhanced tc degradation at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface could be proposed as shown in fig 7 firstly illuminant of xenon lamp excited the separation of photoholes and photoelectrons to generate oxidation ability on ag tio2 surface tc was destroyed through bond cleavage dehydration demethylation hydroxylation and carboxylation which was further decomposed to tricyclic and bicyclic intermediates on the other hand nitrate could be excited by xenon lamp irradiation to form nrs and ros for tc photolysis although the oxidation capacity of nrs was relatively weak huang et al 2018 different from other studies where hydroxyl radical was the main active oxidative species for antibiotics removal wang et al 2017 photoholes played a major role in tc decomposition in this study secondly the successful establishment of the ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface would provide available electron acceptor to expedite photohole electron separation for enhanced tc oxidation resulting into the generation of readily biodegradable intermediates additionally the metabolic activity of microorganisms was enhanced at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface probably due to the availability of biodegradable intermediates especially at the presence of nitrate as the electron acceptor the soluble microbial products such as eps was a key factor to facilitate microbial attachment onto carrier surface and biofilm development zhang et al 2015 the formation of biofilm on the carrier could accelerate extracellular electron transfer which was rather beneficial for tc degradation thirdly specific functional species related to tc biodegradation and electron transfer could be effectively enriched in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system resulting in high toxicity tolerance for tc tc and its intermediates could be metabolized by degradation related species rhodopseudomonas phreatobacter and stenotrophomonas the electrons generated from tc biodegradation could be transmitted to denitrifying species by electroactive species such as delftia functional prediction related to tc degradation denitrification and electron transfer was further depicted by picrust2 analysis based on 16s rrna sequencing and kegg pathways compare to rlight cata bio functional enzymes associated with tc degradation i e ec 1 1 1 26 ec 1 3 1 74 ec 3 5 2 14 ec 3 5 4 12 ec 1 6 3 3 ec 4 1 1 70 and ec 2 7 1 49 were all up regulated fig 7 and table s4 lu et al 2022 the hydroxymethylpyrimidine kinase which was as high as 9 44 in rlight cata bio nitrate was mainly responsible for dehydroxylation reaction gasparrini et al 2020 the abundant of glutaconyl coa decarboxylase in rlight cata bio nitrate was significantly high than that in rlight cata bio 0 17 10 2 vs 0 91 10 5 suggesting that decarboxylation reaction by microorganisms could be facilitated at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface in denitrification pathways the relative abundant of nitrate reductase encoded by narg h i and napa b nitrite reductase encoded by nirs k nitric oxide reductase encoded by norb c and nitrous oxide reductase encoded by nosz was up regulated in rlight cata bio nitrate fig 7 and table s5 confirming the occurrence of denitrification tc degradation intermediates could be mineralized through microbial respiration metabolism at the presence of nitrate which was confirmed by relatively high toc removal in rlight cata bio nitrate the abundances of electron transfer related gene involved in outer membrane c type cytochromes mtra cyma and fcca and redox active molecules such as soluble electron shuttles menc e g and riba were significantly increased in rlight cata bio nitrate fig 7 and table s5 the remarkably higher abundances of genes related to electron transfer in rlight cata bio nitrate indicated that two main electron transfer pathways were accelerated at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface the high electron transfer efficiency at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface significantly improved the synergistic metabolic activity which was of great significance for the enhanced degradation of refractory pollutants in order to investigate complex metabolism and electron transfer process the genetic technology such as quantitative real time pcr should be used to clarify complex biological mechanisms in our future research 3 8 implication in this study a novel ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface was developed for enhanced removal of recalcitrant contaminants such as tc at the presence of nitrate photoelectrons could be rapidly consumed to avoid the recombination of photohole photoelectron pairs which would result in improved oxidation ability of photoholes for the cleavage of tc ring yan et al 2015 nitrate which was the bioavailable electron acceptor could accept photoelectrons as well as electrons generated from microbial metabolism wang et al 2020a at ag tio2 semiconductor microbe interface developed by xiong et al 2018 aeration was required to maintain microbial activity as well as to provide oxygen as the electron acceptor at the bivo4 feooh semiconductor microbe interface developed by shi et al 2020 carbon paper was used as the carriers of bivo4 feooh which was easily covered by biofilm resulting in poor catalytic performance after long term operation in this study ag tio2 semiconductor was loaded on polyurethane carriers while biomass was mainly distributed in channel surface preventing the inhibition of biomass by active free radical during 165 days operation ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface system maintained a relatively high removal efficiency for tc which was of great significance to the practical application for the real wastewater treatment ag doped tio2 as semiconductor materials showed the excellent performance for electron transfer and high stability the separation of photoholes and photoelectrons in semiconductor materials play an important role in the removal of recalcitrant pollutants in our previous study enhanced bio photodegradation of pyridine was achieved at bivo4 feooh semiconductor microbe interface which could be attributed to the relatively high catalytic activity of bivo4 feooh semiconductor shi et al 2020 in our recent study novel cds g c3n4 semiconductor with the heterojunction structure could accelerate separation of photoholes and photoelectrons to enhance 4 chlorophenol degradation in semiconductor microbe interfaces which was attribute to higher photocurrent lower impedance and photoluminescence intensity shi et al 2022 thus other novel semiconductors especially those with the heterojunction construction and visible light response ability such as cds g c3n4 composite would replace ag doped tio2 used in this study to further improve removal efficiency in our future study nitrate was often found in real wastewater containing antibiotics such as municipal aquaculture and swine wastewater biological denitrification could be suppressed due to the inhibition of antibiotics such as tc causing the accumulation of harmful nitrite islam and gilbride 2019 proposed that nitrate removal efficiency could be decreased to less than 50 at tc concentration of 500 μg l 1 the nitrogen removal efficiency was reduced from 80 2 to 69 2 and 65 1 at tc concentration of 2 mg l 1 and 5 mg l 1 due to the inhibition of antibiotics tc chen et al 2015 however most studies were mainly focused on the removal of antibiotics or nitrogen with the relationship between antibiotics degradation and nitrate conversion neglected it should be pointed out that nitrate could be completely removed in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system but without the accumulation of nitrite data not shown indicating that the inhibition of tc on denitrification was negligible in this study tc degradation and nitrogen removal occurred simultaneously in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system providing a potential technology for the treatment of practical wastewater containing antibiotics and nitrate 4 conclusions in this study enhanced tc degradation was successfully achieved in the visible light assisted biodegradation system ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface improved the electron separation on the surface of semiconductor facilitating tc decomposition though the oxidation by photoholes the presence of nitrate resulted into the decrease of biotoxicity and the increase of bioactivity as well as the enrichment of specific functional species involved in tc degradation denitrification and electron transfer this study demonstrated that ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system was a potential technology

16148,due to the pivotal role of ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface enhanced visible light assisted biodegradation of tetracycline tc in anoxic system was realized through both batch experiment and long term operation in this study the results of the batch experiment elucidated that 50 mg l 1 tc could be completely removed within 10 h in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system the continuous flow experiment was operated for 75 d to evaluate the performance and stability of ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system tc removal efficiency in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system was as high as 92 4 1 6 at influent tc concentration of 50 mg l 1 tc and hydraulic retention time hrt of 10 h which would be attributed to the promoted separation of photoholes and photoelectrons at the presence of nitrate as electron acceptor facilitated electron transfer between semiconductor and biofilm was beneficial for enhancing tc biodegradation thus lowering toxicity of intermediate products and promoting microbial activity moreover the species related to tc biodegradation rhodopseudomonas phreatobacter and stenotrophomonas denitrification thauera and electron transfer delftia were enriched at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface besides a possible mechanism involved in enhanced tc degradation and nitrogen removal at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface was proposed this study provided a novel and promising strategy to enhance recalcitrant tc removal from industrial wastewater graphical abstract enhanced degradation mechanism of ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system was proposed image graphical abstract keywords tetracycline ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface electron transfer denitrification microbial community 1 introduction tetracycline tc which is a typical antibiotic is widely used for the control of disease and bacterial infection in humans and animals zhang et al 2011 the discharge of wastewater containing tc into water environment can cause serious threat to environment and human health therefore it is necessary to take targeted treatment of wastewater containing tc biological treatment has turned out to be a preferred technique in wastewater treatment which has the merits of low energy consumption and environmental friendly as compared to physical and chemical methods wang et al 2020a 2021 molecular oxygen often served as electron acceptors to degrade tc under aerobic condition in biological system liao et al 2021 unfortunately aerobic biodegradation could not completely metabolize recalcitrant contaminants such as tc due to the lack of related enzymes although at the expense of high cost consumption due to blast diffusion aeration pan et al 2019 it has been demonstrated that anaerobic treatment as the favorable method could remove organic contaminants via several biodegradation steps by microbial communities such as hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis xu et al 2018a however under the stress of pollutant toxicity the anaerobic biodegradation was often limited by the slow electron transfer and lack of electron acceptors wang et al 2020a recently anoxic treatment based on the biodegradation at the presence of various electron acceptors has attracted increasing attention wang et al 2020a our previous study testified that nitrate as the electron acceptors could enhance anoxic biodegradation of various recalcitrant contaminants such as pyridine hou et al 2018 n methylpyrrolidone nmp wang et al 2019 and n n dimethylformamide dmf wang et al 2020a however anoxic denitrification process related to tc biodegradation was negligible due to its bacteriostasis and poor biodegradability wen et al 2012 zheng et al 2016 tc has a significantly negative effect on biological gas production at the concentration as low as 250 μg l 1 indicating that respiratory metabolism process was rather sensitive to tc hou et al 2016 therefore anoxic biodegradation of tc at the presence of nitrate deserved to be developed in order to remove tc at high concentration recently photogenerated holes oh o2 or other reactive oxidative species were widely investigated to catalyze redox reaction which could transform bio recalcitrant contaminants on semiconductor materials surface via light excitation shi et al 2020 semiconductor materials surface could serve as both electron acceptors or donors to transfer electron from or to contaminants resulting the degradation of recalcitrant contaminants dong et al 2020 electron transfer could be accelerated at the semiconductor interface and it is proved to be feasible to improve the oxidation ability of semiconductor as electron acceptors de araújo et al 2017 liu et al 2020 accelerated degradation of recalcitrant compounds was rather helpful for the reduce of pollutant toxicity promotion of microbial activity and relieving the restriction on microbial respiratory electron transport chain xiong et al 2018 thus it could be inferred that recalcitrant contaminants such as tc could be transformed to easily biodegradable intermediates on semiconductor interface which could be easily utilized by microorganisms jiao et al 2008 in addition nitrate which was a highly efficient electron acceptor could play a key role in electron transfer at semiconductor and microorganism interface therefore it could be hypothesized that integrating semiconductor microorganism with nitrate should be feasible for the treatment of wastewater containing recalcitrant contaminants the coupled semiconductor microorganism nitrate interface would provide a new approach to effectively utilize light energy to drive chemical transformation and accelerate microbial metabolism under anoxic condition the electron transfer system based on light excited semiconductor microorganism nitrate provided a promising prospect for enhanced degradation of bio inhibitory contaminants yu et al 2020 however the construction of light assisted biodegradation system to enhance tc degradation at semiconductor microorganism nitrate interface has been rarely reported furthermore the feasibility of long term operation the influence of key parameters the variation of microbial community and the underlying degradation mechanism were still unclear therefore this study investigated the feasibility and stability of semiconductor microorganism nitrate interface for the enhanced light assisted biodegradation of tc in anoxic condition through both batch and continuous experiments considering that microorganisms could be damaged under ultraviolet light the xenon lamp is used to simulate visible light porous polyurethane material was used as a carrier for both semiconductor and microorganism the outer surface of the carrier was coated by the semiconductor ag tio2 with visible light response and the inner surface was attached by biofilm tc removal performance without and with nitrate was evaluated under various operation strategies in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface system the effect of crucial factor i e nitrate concentration tc concentration and hrt and long terms operation on the performance of continuous reactor was investigated further toxicity bioactivity and microbial community structure was also elucidated the possible mechanism of light assisted biodegradation referred to enhanced tc removal at the ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface was proposed 2 material and methods 2 1

titania and silver respectively sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate c6h5na3 2h2o sinopharm chemical reagent co shanghai china was served as the reducing agent the coating of ag tio2 semiconductor onto porous polyurethane was performed according to dong et al 2016 the detailed procedure was depicted in the text s2 the characterization of ag tio2 semiconductor synthesized was described in text s3 2 2 reactor configuration synthetic wastewater and inocula the schematic diagram of the light assisted biodegradation reactor was depicted in fig s1 the reactor was a rectangular cylinder made of perspex glass with length of 5 cm width of 5 cm and height of 15 cm and the total working volume was 375 ml in order to improve the light transmittance the illuminated side was made of quartz glass the reactor was divided into two compartments to avoid collision between the porous sponge carrier and the rotor through a baffle with hole array installed at the 2 cm from bottom porous polyurethane carriers were stirred in the reactor by magnetic stirring the 300 w xenon lamp with a uv light filter was used as the visible light source and was installed beside the light assisted biodegradation reactor the light intensity of 80 mw cm 2 was close to the average value of the visible light in sunlight light assisted biodegradation experiments were cooled to room temperature using a circulating water system to prevent thermal catalytic effects the cuboidal polyurethane carriers fangdou science and technology ltd kunshan china with side length of 1 cm porosity of 89 and density of 0 1 g ml 1

aerated with nitrogen gas n2 for 10 min to remove dissolved oxygen 2 3 experimental protocols to evaluate the feasibility of light assisted biodegradation of tc batch experiment was conducted in the light assisted biodegradation reactors with the initial tc concentration controlled at 50 mg l 1 nitrate sodium was added into the influent at no3 n concentration of 20 mg l 1 the batch experiment under different protocols were operated for the comparison of tc removal performance the contribution of tc removal through adsorption was evaluated in the control reactors rcon without nitrate rcon nitrate with nitrate with polyurethane carriers loaded by ag tio2 but without the biofilm and light the contribution of tc removal through biodegradation was evaluated in the reactors rbio without

without polyurethane carriers loaded by ag tio2 and biofilm rlight cata without nitrate and rlight cata nitrate with nitrate was operated with polyurethane carriers loaded by ag tio2 under visible light but without biofilm rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate was operated with polyurethane carriers loaded by ag tio2 and biofilm under visible light without nitrate and with nitrate respectively all experiment was repeated three times to calculate average and standard deviation in this study to investigate the performance and stability of ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface system continuous light assisted biodegradation reactors was operated synthetic wastewater was continuously fed into reactor bottom by peristaltic pumps and was continuously discharged from the top of reactor through gravity flow the experiment period of rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate was divided into four phases and the operation condition for each phase were summarized in table 1 in phase i in order to investigate the effect of nitrate dosage on tc degradation no3 n concentration in the influent of rlight cata bio nitrate was increased from 0 to 50 mg l 1 at hrt of 10 h with tc

oxidative species involved in rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate benzoquinone bq isopropanol ipa and potassium iodide ki were added into ag tio2 biofilm system as the scavengers for scavenging o2 oh and photoholes respectively 2 4 analytical methods before analysis all water samples for the identification and quantification of tc and its intermediate were filtered through 0 22 µm

discussion 3 1 enhanced tc removal in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system 3 1 1 tc removal performances under different operation conditions in order to testify the feasibility of ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system for enhanced light assisted tc biodegradation tc removal performances in ten systems were compared as demonstrated in fig 1 tc was slightly removed in both rcon and rcon nitrate with tc concentration decreased slightly from 52 8 2 1 and 51 7 1 9 mg l 1 to 47 8 0 6 and 46 9 1 3 mg l 1 within 10 h respectively the inappreciable tc removal indicated that the contribution of tc removal due to absorption was limited in both systems with or without nitrate the slight difference between rcon and rcon nitrate indicated that adsorption of tc could not be significantly affected by nitrate rlight showed similar tendency with rcon with tc concentration decreased from 53 8 2 3 mg l 1 to 45 5 0 9 indicating that sole photolysis could not effectively remove tc tc concentration of rlight nitrtate decreased from 49 7 0 9 to 40 7 0 7 mg l 1 within 10 h when tc removal efficiency in rlight nitrate was 3 higher compared with rlight probably due to the promoted photolysis of tc at the presence of nitrate nitrate could act as photosensitizer for tc photolysis because nitrate excited by light irradiation could form nitrogen reactive species nrs and reactive oxygen species ros nélieu et al 2009 tc concentration in rbio slightly decreased from 51 3 1 7 mg l 1 to 43 5 0 12 mg l 1 within 10 h which was close to those in both rcon and rcon nitrate this result indicated that tc removal through sole biodegradation was also limited probably due to toxicity and recalcitrance of tc bílková et al 2019 in contrast tc concentration in rbio nitrate decreased obviously from 50 1 1 4 to 34 6 0 9 mg l 1 within 10 h compared with rbio tc removal was enhanced with removal efficiency 12 5 higher for rbio nitrate indicating that nitrate as the electron acceptor could be beneficial for tc biodegradation organic contaminant could be transformed more easily with the supply of available electron acceptor such as nitrate through which electron produced from contaminant oxidation could be consumed rapidly through microbial metabolism wang et al 2020a tc removal performance in rlight cata and rlight cata nitrate were obviously improved as illustrated by tc concentration decreased rapidly from initial 49 7 0 8 and 52 1 1 7 mg l 1 to 23 6 0 7 and 18 7 2 4 mg l 1 within 2 h and then further decreased to 18 0 9 and 12 5 0 9 mg l 1 within 10 h respectively the decrease of tc concentration indicated that ag tio2 semiconductor could drive tc degradation under visible light particularly tc removal in rlight cata nitrate was about 12 higher compared with rlight cata which could be attributed to the catalysis on semiconductor interface especially at the presence of nitrate ag tio2 nitrate interface might improve catalytic capacity for tc degradation probably through acceleration of charge transfer liu et al 2020 in addition low concentration of anions such as nitrate promoted adsorption capacity of tc on semiconductor surface by reducing intermolecular repulsive forces which was consistent with zhang et al 2020b tc concentration in rlight cata bio ultimately decreased from 50 4 1 9 to 9 8 0 3 mg l 1 with the concentration decreased in rlight cata bio high than the sum of rlight cata and rbio indicating the synergistic effect between ag tio2 and biofilm under visible light biodegradation of tc intermediates produced from semiconductor catalysis could enhance the utilization of light energy for tc decomposing xiong et al 2018 besides electron transfer from semiconductor to microbe was helpful for the promotion of organic contaminant degradation ding et al 2018 shi et al 2020 notably rather excellent tc removal performance was demonstrated in rlight cata bio nitrate with tc concentration declined rapidly from 51 6 2 3 to 6 8 1 6 mg l 1 in the initial 1 h and further decline to 0 mg l 1 within 1 5 h compare with rlight cata nitrate and rlight cata bio complete tc removal within reaction time as short as 1 5 h in rlight cata bio nitrate indicated that nitrate could promote synergy between ag tio2 and biofilm at the interface moreover the removal profiles under different operation conditions were fitted according to first order kinetics as indicated by fig 1 and table s1 the first order removal rates k of the degradation systems with nitrate were generally greater than those without nitrate particularly the removal rate of rlight cata bio nitrate was as high as 2 53 h 1 versus 1 75 h 1 for rlight cata bio in the photocatalysis microbe system where the ag tio2 was used as the semiconductor material developed tc removal rate was as low as 0 59 h 1 probably due to the absence of nitrate xiong et al 2017 ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system developed in this study was relatively efficient in terms of tc removal confirming the key role of nitrate in tc degradation 3 1 2 performance of tc degradation in continuous experiment process the effect of key operation parameters i e no3 n concentration initial tc concentration and hrt on tc removal was rather crucial to achieve a feasible strategy for biosystem operation with the no3 n concentration increased gradually from initial 0 mg l 1 to 20 mg l 1 tc removal efficiency increased obviously from 45 4 2 4 to 91 6 6 1 fig 2 a however with the no3 n concentration further increased to 50 mg l 1 tc removal efficiency decreased to 62 2 0 8 suggesting the inhibition of tc removal at high no3 n dosage similar phenomenon was observed in tc photodegradation system by chen et al 2017 where tc removal rate decreased by 14 97 at no3 concentration higher than 0 05 mol l 1 due to the enlarged electrostatic repulsive force at the presence of high dosage nitrate lado ribeiro et al 2019 indicated that no3 n at high concentration could be adsorbed on the semiconductor surface competing for the active sites with the target contaminants furthermore excess nitrate plays a role of scavenger to consume photoholes and active free radical species generated on semiconductor payan et al 2019 it was worth noting that deteriorated tc removal performance at no3 n concentration of 50 mg l 1 was still higher than that rlight cata bio unlike tc removal toc removal efficiency increased gradually from 13 5 2 4 to 67 4 2 1 as the increase of no3 n concentration from 0 mg l 1 to 50 mg l 1 which could be attributed to the denitrification process via nitrate at related high concentration in our previous study mineralization efficiency of refractory compounds such as pyridine was significantly enhanced at the presence of nitrate indicating that nitrate as electron acceptor play a key role in simultaneous removal of pyridine and nitrogen hou et al 2018 influent concentration of recalcitrant contaminants should have an appreciable impact on reactor performance ou et al 2016 as indicated in fig 2b the reactor performance was remained relatively steady even when initial tc concentration increased from 20 mg l 1 to 50 mg l 1 as shown by slightly decreased tc and toc removal efficiency in rlight cata bio nitrate from 96 1 3 4 and 67 7 0 9 to 92 3 1 1 and 65 3 2 3 respectively however with the further increase of initial tc concentration to 100 mg l 1 tc and toc removal efficiency were sharply decreased to 58 3 3 8 and 50 6 4 1 respectively noteworthy deterioration of rlight cata bio nitrate performance in terms of tc and toc removal could be attributed to the reduced microbial activity at the presence of high concentration antibacterial tc lee et al 2020 however with initial tc concentration increased from 20 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 tc and toc concentration in rlight cata bio was decreased sharply from 85 7 1 8 and 65 9 0 8 to 29 9 2 3 and 25 6 1 7 respectively similar inhibition due to high tc dosage on microbial activity was widely reported chen et al 2016 dong et al 2016 niu et al 2013 reactor performance of rlight cata bio nitrate were much better than rlight cata bio especially at high tc dosage which was consistent with the profile described in fig 1 from these results the influent tc concentration in rlight cata bio nitrate should be controlled at 50 mg l 1 in order to maintain optimal removal efficiency for reactor operation for the practical treatment of wastewater containing toxic contaminants such as tc hrt should be adjusted properly in order to keep a proper loading rate wu et al 2018 as indicated in fig 2c as hrt decreased from 24 h to 6 h tc and toc removal efficiency in rlight cata bio decreased from 53 8 4 9 and 54 9 2 4 to 39 6 4 2 and 43 7 1 0 respectively however with the decrease of hrt from 24 h to 10 h tc removal efficiency in rlight cata bio nitrate decreased slightly from 94 1 2 5 to 92 9 1 9 respectively proving the efficient removal performance in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system when hrt was further decreased to 6 h tc removal efficiency was decreased to 62 6 1 8 which was still obviously higher than that in rlight cata bio correspondingly toc removal in rlight cata bio nitrate have been weakly affected with hrt decreased from 24 h to 6 h as displayed by the slight decrease of toc removal efficiency from 74 5 0 9 on 24 h to 65 8 1 4 on 10 h and then to 50 4 2 1 on 6 h therefore hrt of rlight cata bio nitrate was controlled at 10 h in the following study the stability of the biosystem during long term operation is of the primary concern to achieve the practical application considering the semiconductor photocorrosion and toxicity of tc long term operation performance deserved to be investigated to estimate the stability of ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate was operated in parallel from day 91 to day 165 at influent tc concentration of 50 mg l 1 and hrt of 10 h as indicated in fig 2d tc removal efficiencies in rlight cata bio nitrate increased slightly from 90 1 on day 91 to 93 8 on day 165 which was significantly higher than those in rlight cata bio above 40 correspondingly toc removal efficiency in rlight cata bio nitrate was always higher than 63 while toc removal efficiency in rlight cata bio was obviously below 50 tc removal efficiency based on ternary bivo4 ag cu2o nanocomposites was about 91 22 which was comparable with this study deng et al 2017 these results demonstrated that ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system could maintain a long term stable performance in terms of tc and toc removal indicating that rlight cata bio nitrate would have a huge potential for enhanced removal of recalcitrant organics from real wastewater 3 2 tc degradation intermediates and possible degradation pathway in order to reveal the possible tc degradation pathway the intermediate products in rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate were recognized by hplc ms spectrometer table s2 and fig s4 in rlight cata bio m1 m2 m3 m6 m7 m8 m9 m13 m14 m15 and m20 of intermediates were identified more product categories were detected in rlight cata bio nitrate including m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 m8 m9 m10 m11 m12 m13 m14 m15 m16 m17 m18 m19 m20 m22 m23 m24 and m25 the mutual products in both rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate were m1 m2 m3 m8 m9 m13 m14 m15 and m20 m1 m2 m3 m8 and m13 as the main intermediate products of tc degradation was also observed in other literatures cai et al 2020 xiong et al 2018 yang et al 2018 where tc transformation was catalyzed by semiconductor under light it is interesting to note that products including m4 m5 m10 m11 m12 m16 m17 m18 m19 m21 m22 m23 m24 and m25 was only observed in rlight cata bio nitrate speculating that more complicated reactions occurred in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system in addition m4 m5 m10 and m11 was also produced in other photocatalysis systems with the irradiation by excited nitrate chen et al 2016 huang et al 2018 xu et al 2020 yang et al 2018 indicating that nitrate played a significant role in tc transformation in photocatalysis systems based on the above intermediates analysis possible pathway for enhanced tc degradation in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system was proposed fig 3 firstly tc was transformed to the intermediates with four rings including m1 m2 m3 m4 and m5 through hydroxylation dehydroxylation demethylation dehydration carboxylation and bond cleavage these intermediates could be resulted from the oxidative transformation of tc by various oxidative species such as photoholes hydroxyl radical species etc xiong et al 2018 2017 xu et al 2020 subsequently these intermediates with four rings were further oxidized to m8 m9 m10 m11 and m12 through the deprivation of methyl formyl hydroxyl and amino groups resulting into the formation of m13 m14 m15 m16 m17 m18 and m19 similar conversion process was proposed in other visible light driven system for tc degradation zhu et al 2017 as is well known complete contaminant degradation can be limited by the mineralization ability of semiconductor catalysis wang et al 2011 the produced intermediates with three rings via the destruction of 4 ring structure compound could be further oxidized by microorganisms therefore m20 m22 m23 m24 and m25 were formed through the cleavage of c c bond and benzene ring structure hydroxylation and carboxylation and then final mineralization occurred to produce h2o and co2 compared with rlight cata bio successive hydroxylation reaction in rlight cata bio nitrate was rather crucial in tc degradation which could be attributed to promotion of oxidation ability at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface besides intermediates with four rings namely m6 and m7 were obviously accumulated in rlight cata bio which were relatively stable at semiconductor interface probably due to the lack of oxidative species in rlight cata bio he et al 2014 the generated intermediates i e m6 and m7 in rlight cata bio would be rather recalcitrant and difficult to be further mineralized through microbial metabolism the above intermediates and pathway analysis concluded that ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface not only promoted the oxidation process in intermediate transformation but also facilitated the further decomposition of intermediates through anoxic respiration process at the presence of nitrate eem was measured to analyze chemical characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom during tc degradation process further elucidating tc degradation pathway as indicated in fig s5 the two apparent fluorophores in the influent of both rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate were identified at excitation emission ex em wavelength of 350 520 nm and 400 520 nm in region v which was related to humic acid like substances obvious migration of fluorophores to ex em 275 520 nm in effluent were observed corresponding to fulvic acid like substances which was located in region v implying that tc was efficiently transformed coincidentally similar shift was also observed in bioi ag agi catalyzed system for tc degradation yang et al 2018 where this migration was thought to be related to the decomposition of polycyclic aromatic moieties other major fluorescence peaks of rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate were severally assigned to humic acid like humic acids fulvic acids tryptophan and protein like in regions v iii ii and iv which were typical biomass associated products ni et al 2011 shao et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 specially the production of humic acid like substance was accompanied by the decomposition of macromolecular organic such as ciprofloxacin tetracycline zhang et al 2018 in various degradation process humic acid could accelerate the energy and electron transfer zhang et al 2019 the fluorescence intensities of the peaks observed in rlight cata bio nitrate were higher than those in rlight cata bio indicating that microorganisms in rlight cata bio nitrate consumed more organic substances through respiration metabolism which was consistent with efficient tc removal in rlight cata bio nitrate microorganism metabolism would result in the secretion of various dissolved organic matters such as humic acid and protein like matter according to eem analysis more humic acid tryptophan protein like matter and aromatic protein substances could be generated in rlight cata bio nitrate than rlight cata bio indicating higher microbial activity in rlight cata bio nitrate the tryptophan protein and humic acid substances generated from microbial metabolism during tc biodegradation process could contribute to stability of biological system as well as microbial activity especially in the denitrification process he et al 2018 in addition extracellular electron transfer among bacteria could be promoted by dissolved organic matters such as humic acid substances as the electron shuttles as well bacterial cell growth could be promoted by the dissolved organic matters especially for proteobacteria phylum li et al 2022 3 3 fabrication of ag tio2 biofilm interface formation of biofilm and stability of ag tio2 coated should play a pivotal role in the successful fabrication of ag tio2 biofilm interface fig s6 depicted sem images of inner and external of the porous carriers used in both rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate to evaluate the special distribution of semiconductor and microorganisms prior to operation ag tio2 was coated tightly with the interior and exterior surface of the polyurethane carriers fig s6a and b at the end of phase iv for the polyurethane carriers taken from both rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate ag tio2 was still tightly attached on the exterior surface without obvious loss fig s6c and d indicating that ag tio2 coating on polyurethane carriers were quite stable in ag tio2 biofilm system after long term operation additionally few microorganism cells were observed on the exterior surface coated by ag tio2 probably due to the toxicity stimulation by tc and semiconductor induced damage i e photogenerated holes and active free radical dong et al 2016 in contrast obvious biofilm was observed in the interior pores of polyurethane carriers taken from both rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate fig s6e and f the growth of biofilm could be attributed to the fact that rough surface of polyurethane carriers coated by ag tio2 provided attachment sites for microorganisms compared with the sparse and nonuniform biofilm observed in rlight cata bio the biofilm in rlight cata bio nitrate obviously presented dense and tight structure microorganisms was enriched to fabricate biofilm in rlight cata bio nitrate where the biomass was significantly higher than that in rlight cata bio the thick biofilm observed in rlight cata bio nitrate could be helpful for the protection of the microbes inside against toxicity persecution especially for the species with a long growth period 3 4 functionalized microbial community in ag tio2 biofilm system microbial community analysis of the seed sludge and the biofilm in rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate after long term operation was carried out the microbial diversity of rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate were relatively lower as compared with seed sludge which could be attributed to the inhibition and selection role of tc and oxidative species in ag tio2 biofilm system table s3 as indicated in fig 4 a chloroflexi 22 31 proteobacteria 19 78 firmicutes 17 38 bacteroidetes 13 00 deinococcus thermus 8 41 and ignavibacteriae 5 87 were the dominant bacterial phyla in seed sludge which were reported to be the typical microbial species in biological wastewater treatment system ou et al 2016 the contrastive analysis of three samples reflected that bacterial species were severely reduced in ag tio2 biofilm system i e the major phyla were only proteobacteria 88 12 and 91 91 and bacteroidetes 11 86 and 6 90 in rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate respectively this result indicated that selective enrichment of function species could be induced under environment stress such as tc toxicity and light stimulation in addition both proteobacteria and bacteroidetes have been found to survive well in other tc degradation system lan et al 2020 su et al 2020 further analysis of community structure at the genus level was shown in fig 4b the species such as truepera 8 40 clostridium 6 63 trichococcus 5 56 arenimonas 5 00 filimonas 3 79 and thiobacillis 2 86 were found to be dominated in the seed sludge however these species have completely lost dominance in both rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate probably because of their poor adaptability in rlight cata bio rhodopseudomonas 65 73 delftia 14 67 macellibacterium 9 67 and bosea 2 10 were found to be dominant the most dominant species in rlight cata bio nitrate were rhodopseudomonas delftia thauera phreatobacter and stenotrophomonas with relative abundances of 68 20 8 86 4 84 1 82 and 1 48 respectively rhodopseudomonas which was a typical photosynthetic species could be used to degrade various polycyclic aromatic compounds at high concentration wu et al 2019 additionally rhodopseudomonas had excellent tolerance to toxic chemicals such as antibiotics and herbicides wu et al 2020 delftia which was capable of utilizing organic compounds as electron donors was an exoelectrongens which was beneficial for extracellular electron transfer he et al 2020 macellibacterium could utilize glucose to produce volatile fatty acids through fermentation in anaerobic metabolism system jabari et al 2012 bosea was found to be resistant to multiple antibiotics which was often found in the microbial community of other system treating wastewater containing tc low et al 2016 thauera was reported to be able to achieve the cleavage of the aromatic ring as well as a denitrifier xiong et al 2018 the strong correlation of resistance gene with thauera would facilitate the denitrifying process using tc as electron donor and carbon source at low dissolved oxygen concentration wang et al 2020b zou et al 2020 phreatobacter could be resistant to strong oxidants such as hydroxyl radical and effectively utilize organic substrates choi et al 2019 stenotrophomonas could utilize aromatic hydrocarbon contaminations as sole carbon source for denitrification bashandy et al 2020 in addition the abundances of functional species namely rhodopseudomonas thauera phreatobacter and stenotrophomonas in rlight cata bio nitrate was significantly higher than those in rlight cata bio speculating that the nitrate assisted the enrichment of functional species as electron acceptors in addition the presence of nitrate promoted further degradation of tc intermediates resulting into the enrichment of functional species related to nitrification interestingly the abundance of delftia associated with electron transport was relatively low in rlight cata bio nitrate as compared with rlight cata bio probably due to the direct electron transfer at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface reducing the dependence on electroactive species the enrichment of rhodopseudomonas delftia thauera phreatobacter and stenotrophomonas in rlight cata bio nitrate would contribute the high removal efficiency of tc and toc in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system 3 5 microbial activity and toxicity variation atp could be used as a crucial indicator to evaluate the microbial activity in biological metabolism velasco alvarez et al 2011 as demonstrated in fig 5 a the atp content in rlight cata bio decreased from 0 80 0 11 µmol l 1 on day 50 to 0 49 0 04 µmol l 1 on day 165 however the atp content in rlight cata bio nitrate increased from 0 90 0 06 µmol l 1 on day 50 to 1 2 0 03 µmol l 1 on day 165 it was indisputable that more atp was synthesized in rlight cata bio nitrate probably due to the fact that organic substrates could be thoroughly decomposed at the presence of nitrate nitrate was responsible for electron transfer to accelerate the biological respiration for atp generation wang et al 2020a meanwhile the high atp activity could promote secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps to defense cell destruction from toxic substance xiong and liu 2010 which could be indicated by the thick biofilm observed in sem images fig s6 the accumulation of tryptophan protein like matter and aromatic protein in rlight cata bio nitrate reflected the intense microbial activity in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system the increase of atp activity in rlight cata bio nitrate was consistent with the high tc and toc removal as well as the high microbial diversity in rlight cata bio nitrate similar phenomenon was also observed in a photo assisted biodegradation system for sulfamethoxazole removal where the increase of atp content inferred the fast biomass growth high toc removal efficiency and increased living cells liu et al 2022 this profile of atp variation was similar to ailijiang et al 2016 where the increased metabolic activity resulted in enhancement of phenol removal rate effluent from antibiotic wastewater treatment could cause adverse toxic effects on aqueous environments and human health the potential toxicity of tc and tc products might have a significant impact for microbial metabolism xu et al 2018b as demonstrated in fig 5b the relative inhibition ratios in rlight cata bio nitrate decreased from 39 8 3 6 on day 50 to 22 4 2 9 on day 165 which was obviously lower than those in rlight cata bio the low relative inhibition ratio was consistent with the low residual tc and toc in rlight cata bio nitrate indicating that the toxic tc and its degradation intermediates could be decomposed efficiently in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system the high inhibition ratio in rlight cata bio was consistent with the high residual of tc and the obvious accumulation of intermediates such as m6 and m7 niu et al 2013 evaluated the toxicity of tc intermediates by p phosphoreum and found that sloughed groups such as n methyl from tc and its intermediates increased the toxicity due to the lowered steric resistance and improved penetration into cell 3 6 electron transfer and active oxidative species at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface several active oxidative species such as h oh and o2 could be produced on semiconductor under light which could be used to catalyze oxidation for tc degradation as depicted in fig 6 a no obvious change in terms of tc removal efficiency could be observed in both rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate with the addition of o2 scavenger namely 1 4 benzoquinone bq indicating that the contribution of o2 for tc removal was negligible the relatively low concentration of dissolved oxygen in both rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate could be another reason for this result tc removal efficiency of rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate was slightly decreased to 74 7 3 52 and 89 78 4 37 respectively when oh scavenger namely isopropanol ipa was added however when photohole scavenger namely potassium iodide ki was added into both reactors serious suppression of tc removal appeared as indicated by the sharp decrease of tc removal efficiency to 45 12 7 93 and 51 2 5 45 in rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate therefore it could be inferred that photoholes were the main active species responsible for tc degradation rather than o2 and oh in this study aromatic ring compounds such as benzene could be attacked more easily by electron deficient electrophiles such as photoholes ji et al 2018 however about 50 of tc was still removed in rlight cata bio nitrate when photoholes were quenched although the removal performance was relatively poor this result indicated that tc could be removed in multiple ways such as biodegradation photodegradation and adsorption biodegradation could play a key role in tc removal especially at the presence of nitrate as the electron acceptor the key role of the photoholes in tc removal indicated that the photoelectrons could be consumed efficiently on ag tio2 semiconductor by nitrate at the presence of microbe on the special structure of interface at the presence of nitrate enhanced photohole electron pair separation could be achieved through the facilitated photoelectron transfer to nitrate resulting the efficient oxidation of organic compounds by photoholes similar phenomenon was also observed in bivo4 feooh semiconductor microbe biohybrid system by shi et al 2020 where photoelectrons at light excited was transferred to biofilm for enhanced pyridine degradation in order to investigate the performance of charge transmission at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and linear sweep voltammetry were performed as shown by smaller arc radius at both low frequency and high frequency fig 6b charge transfer resistance in rlight cata bio nitrate was significantly lower than those in rbio rbio nitrate rlight cata rlight cata nitrate and rlight cata bio indicating the enhanced separation of photoelectron photohole pairs and the transmission of photoelectrons at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface the increase of the charge transfer resistance at low frequency was observed in rlight cata bio suggesting that photoelectrons produced could not be transmitted efficiently to the biofilm compared with rlight cata bio nitrate the charge transfer resistance at high frequency in rlight cata nitrate was increased indicating that semiconductor biofilm interface was beneficial for photoelectron transport hence the charge transfer resistance was weakened at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface which could be attributed to the fact that the photoelectrons could be consumed easily by the attached biofilm at the presence of nitrate as the electron acceptor zhang et al 2020a indicated that the smaller arc radius represented the increased interfacial electron transport and electrical conductivity which could be attributed to the electron transfer channel formed at semiconductor interface furthermore linear sweep voltammetry further revealed the capability of electron conduction and interfacial electron transfer in rlight cata bio and rlight cata bio nitrate fig 6c the current density in rlight cata bio nitrate 0 095 ma cm 2 was much higher than that in rlight cata bio 0 017 ma cm 2 at potential of 1 2 v as indicated by zhou et al 2018 the current density in n tio2 biofilm interface was increased largely as compared to biofilm interface which was consistent with this study yan et al 2015 found that photocurrent was prone to transferring to the electrolyte rather than retaining on the semiconductor nitrate in the electrolyte could be easily utilized as the electron acceptor to facilitate charge transfer from semiconductor which could be the main reason for relatively high current density and low charge transfer resistance in rlight cata bio nitrate 3 7 mechanism for enhanced tc removal at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface to sum up the possible synergistic mechanism for enhanced tc degradation at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface could be proposed as shown in fig 7 firstly illuminant of xenon lamp excited the separation of photoholes and photoelectrons to generate oxidation ability on ag tio2 surface tc was destroyed through bond cleavage dehydration demethylation hydroxylation and carboxylation which was further decomposed to tricyclic and bicyclic intermediates on the other hand nitrate could be excited by xenon lamp irradiation to form nrs and ros for tc photolysis although the oxidation capacity of nrs was relatively weak huang et al 2018 different from other studies where hydroxyl radical was the main active oxidative species for antibiotics removal wang et al 2017 photoholes played a major role in tc decomposition in this study secondly the successful establishment of the ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface would provide available electron acceptor to expedite photohole electron separation for enhanced tc oxidation resulting into the generation of readily biodegradable intermediates additionally the metabolic activity of microorganisms was enhanced at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface probably due to the availability of biodegradable intermediates especially at the presence of nitrate as the electron acceptor the soluble microbial products such as eps was a key factor to facilitate microbial attachment onto carrier surface and biofilm development zhang et al 2015 the formation of biofilm on the carrier could accelerate extracellular electron transfer which was rather beneficial for tc degradation thirdly specific functional species related to tc biodegradation and electron transfer could be effectively enriched in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system resulting in high toxicity tolerance for tc tc and its intermediates could be metabolized by degradation related species rhodopseudomonas phreatobacter and stenotrophomonas the electrons generated from tc biodegradation could be transmitted to denitrifying species by electroactive species such as delftia functional prediction related to tc degradation denitrification and electron transfer was further depicted by picrust2 analysis based on 16s rrna sequencing and kegg pathways compare to rlight cata bio functional enzymes associated with tc degradation i e ec 1 1 1 26 ec 1 3 1 74 ec 3 5 2 14 ec 3 5 4 12 ec 1 6 3 3 ec 4 1 1 70 and ec 2 7 1 49 were all up regulated fig 7 and table s4 lu et al 2022 the hydroxymethylpyrimidine kinase which was as high as 9 44 in rlight cata bio nitrate was mainly responsible for dehydroxylation reaction gasparrini et al 2020 the abundant of glutaconyl coa decarboxylase in rlight cata bio nitrate was significantly high than that in rlight cata bio 0 17 10 2 vs 0 91 10 5 suggesting that decarboxylation reaction by microorganisms could be facilitated at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface in denitrification pathways the relative abundant of nitrate reductase encoded by narg h i and napa b nitrite reductase encoded by nirs k nitric oxide reductase encoded by norb c and nitrous oxide reductase encoded by nosz was up regulated in rlight cata bio nitrate fig 7 and table s5 confirming the occurrence of denitrification tc degradation intermediates could be mineralized through microbial respiration metabolism at the presence of nitrate which was confirmed by relatively high toc removal in rlight cata bio nitrate the abundances of electron transfer related gene involved in outer membrane c type cytochromes mtra cyma and fcca and redox active molecules such as soluble electron shuttles menc e g and riba were significantly increased in rlight cata bio nitrate fig 7 and table s5 the remarkably higher abundances of genes related to electron transfer in rlight cata bio nitrate indicated that two main electron transfer pathways were accelerated at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface the high electron transfer efficiency at ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface significantly improved the synergistic metabolic activity which was of great significance for the enhanced degradation of refractory pollutants in order to investigate complex metabolism and electron transfer process the genetic technology such as quantitative real time pcr should be used to clarify complex biological mechanisms in our future research 3 8 implication in this study a novel ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface was developed for enhanced removal of recalcitrant contaminants such as tc at the presence of nitrate photoelectrons could be rapidly consumed to avoid the recombination of photohole photoelectron pairs which would result in improved oxidation ability of photoholes for the cleavage of tc ring yan et al 2015 nitrate which was the bioavailable electron acceptor could accept photoelectrons as well as electrons generated from microbial metabolism wang et al 2020a at ag tio2 semiconductor microbe interface developed by xiong et al 2018 aeration was required to maintain microbial activity as well as to provide oxygen as the electron acceptor at the bivo4 feooh semiconductor microbe interface developed by shi et al 2020 carbon paper was used as the carriers of bivo4 feooh which was easily covered by biofilm resulting in poor catalytic performance after long term operation in this study ag tio2 semiconductor was loaded on polyurethane carriers while biomass was mainly distributed in channel surface preventing the inhibition of biomass by active free radical during 165 days operation ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface system maintained a relatively high removal efficiency for tc which was of great significance to the practical application for the real wastewater treatment ag doped tio2 as semiconductor materials showed the excellent performance for electron transfer and high stability the separation of photoholes and photoelectrons in semiconductor materials play an important role in the removal of recalcitrant pollutants in our previous study enhanced bio photodegradation of pyridine was achieved at bivo4 feooh semiconductor microbe interface which could be attributed to the relatively high catalytic activity of bivo4 feooh semiconductor shi et al 2020 in our recent study novel cds g c3n4 semiconductor with the heterojunction structure could accelerate separation of photoholes and photoelectrons to enhance 4 chlorophenol degradation in semiconductor microbe interfaces which was attribute to higher photocurrent lower impedance and photoluminescence intensity shi et al 2022 thus other novel semiconductors especially those with the heterojunction construction and visible light response ability such as cds g c3n4 composite would replace ag doped tio2 used in this study to further improve removal efficiency in our future study nitrate was often found in real wastewater containing antibiotics such as municipal aquaculture and swine wastewater biological denitrification could be suppressed due to the inhibition of antibiotics such as tc causing the accumulation of harmful nitrite islam and gilbride 2019 proposed that nitrate removal efficiency could be decreased to less than 50 at tc concentration of 500 μg l 1 the nitrogen removal efficiency was reduced from 80 2 to 69 2 and 65 1 at tc concentration of 2 mg l 1 and 5 mg l 1 due to the inhibition of antibiotics tc chen et al 2015 however most studies were mainly focused on the removal of antibiotics or nitrogen with the relationship between antibiotics degradation and nitrate conversion neglected it should be pointed out that nitrate could be completely removed in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system but without the accumulation of nitrite data not shown indicating that the inhibition of tc on denitrification was negligible in this study tc degradation and nitrogen removal occurred simultaneously in ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system providing a potential technology for the treatment of practical wastewater containing antibiotics and nitrate 4 conclusions in this study enhanced tc degradation was successfully achieved in the visible light assisted biodegradation system ag tio2 biofilm nitrate interface improved the electron separation on the surface of semiconductor facilitating tc decomposition though the oxidation by photoholes the presence of nitrate resulted into the decrease of biotoxicity and the increase of bioactivity as well as the enrichment of specific functional species involved in tc degradation denitrification and electron transfer this study demonstrated that ag tio2 biofilm nitrate system was a potential technology for enhancing visible light assisted biodegradation of recalcitrant organic contaminants such as tc declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16149,drinking water at the point of use harbors microorganisms that may pose potential risks to human health however the microbial diversity and health impacts of household drinking water are poorly understood since culture based methods only target on specific microorganisms and low biomass of drinking water hinders a high throughput profiling here we used an optimized workflow to efficiently collect microorganisms from low biomass drinking water and performed deep sequencing of 16s rrna genes to profile the bacterial diversity and biogeography of 110 household drinking water samples covering 38 cities of 29 provinces regions in china and further explored environmental drivers and potential health implications our analyses revealed a diverse drinking water community comprising a total of 22 771 operational taxonomic units otus the spatial turnover of drinking water communities is scale dependent and appears to be driven largely by rainfall and water source river the identified potential pathogenic species may have the possibility of causing health risks our novel insights enhance the current understanding of the diversity and biogeography of drinking water bacterial communities within a theoretical ecological framework and have further important implications for safe drinking water management and public health protection graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water microbial diversity biogeography public health 1 introduction the safety of drinking water is a major concern worldwide risks to human health may arise from consumption of drinking water contaminated with infectious agents cotruvo 2017 researchers have previously detected diverse human pathogens in drinking water such as the obligate pathogens vibrio cholera ferdous et al 2018 escherichia coli ikonen et al 2017 and shigella flexneri parist et al 2018 the opportunistic pathogen sphingomonas paucimobilis ryan and adley 2010 and even the emerging pathogen naegleria fowleri bartrand et al 2014 the problem of drinking water contamination is more serious in developing countries due to limited treatment processes and contaminated source water ferdous et al detected v cholerae in 10 of point of drinking water samples and 9 of source water samples collected in a low income urban community in bangladesh ferdous et al 2018 the prevalence of human pathogens in drinking water may be associated with serious diseases thus a comprehensive understanding of the microbial community in drinking water especially at the point of use is essential when making decisions regarding water management and increasing public accessibility to safe drinking water generally the microbiological monitoring of drinking water is specified by the world health organization and national practices which rely mainly on traditional culture based methods such as heterotrophic plate counts and selective plating of certain organisms allen et al 2004 however the general limitation of culture based methods is that they yield only a very small fraction approximately 0 25 of the microorganisms in drinking water environments roeselers et al 2015 van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 in recent years advances in genomic technologies have overcome this limitation by enabling the profiling of microbial communities based on high throughput sequencing hts and bioinformatics analyses of microbial 16s rrna genes facilitating in depth and comprehensive analyses of microbial communities ramirez et al 2018 thompson et al 2017 with the concerns related to drinking water safety considerable efforts were then paid to profile microbial communities in drinking water systems based on hts of 16s rrna genes and revealed the effects of treatment processes el chakhtoura et al 2018 han et al 2020 jia et al 2015 pinto et al 2012 pipe infrastructure ling et al 2018 roeselers et al 2015 and environmental conditions el chakhtoura et al 2018 ji et al 2017 on drinking water microbial community for household drinking water researchers had revealed the impacts of water source and treatment processes on tap water microbiome by non metric multidimensional scaling and source tracking analysis han et al 2020 roeselers et al 2015 nevertheless the current understanding of their link to public health is incomplete hull et al 2019 the low biomass sampling standardization and sample collection permission also hindered our comprehensive understanding recently with the increasing concerns to public health researchers appealed for a global drinking water microbiome project hull et al 2019 and highlighted the urgent needs on large scale study for comprehensive spatiotemporal understanding of drinking water microbiome considering the present patchwork of knowledge makes it difficult to assess the associated health risks and determine comprehensive control strategies consequently microbiological surveillance efforts intended to provide safe drinking water require a comprehensive understanding of the diversity and biogeography of the household drinking water microbiome based on which to assess the potential risks to public health and conduct microbiological safety management for drinking water in this study we used an optimized method to efficiently collect microorganisms from low biomass household drinking water and profiled bacterial communities of household drinking water samples collected from 38 cities in 29 provinces regions of china by deep sequencing of 16s rrna genes to 1 understand the diversity and biogeography of the bacterial communities in large scale household drinking water samples 2 to investigate the key environmental drivers that shape the diversity and biogeography of drinking water microbial communities and further 3 to explore the potential effects of household drinking water microbiome on human health 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and pretreatment a total of 110 tap water samples were collected from households in 38 cities of 29 provinces regions in china during december 2014 to march 2015 the detailed sample information e g sample id sampling location and sampling date is listed in table s1 to solve the problem of extremely low biomass in tap water that usually does not meet the requirement of high throughput sequencing and is an obstacle to profile bacterial diversity we optimized the sample collection and pretreatment process from our previous study chao et al 2013 to more effectively collect microorganisms from drinking water see details in fig s7 microorganisms in each sample were collected by filtering tap water through high performance cartridge type water purifiers torayvino toray industries inc japan three purifiers not exposed to tap water served as the blank samples microbial cells were then detached from the hollow fiber filters within the purifiers into ultrapure water via ultrasonication branson ultrasonics corp usa and were subsequently collected by filtration using a 0 45 μm cellulose ester membrane millipore corp usa ma et al 2017 the membranes were then stored at 20 c prior to dna extraction 2 2 dna extraction and illumina miseq

measured using a qubit 2 0 fluorometer invitrogen life techniques usa the dna concentrations in the three blank samples were below the detection limit the v4 region 265 nucleotides of the 16s rrna

at 95 c for 2 min followed by 30 cycles at 95 c for 20 s 55 c for 15 s and 72 c for 5 min with a final extension at 72 c for 10 min kozich et al 2013 all of the pcrs were performed in triplicate to avoid the bias of unequal amplification acinas et al 2005 and the purified amplicons were pooled all the experiments were conducted in one lab environmental microbiome engineering and biotechnology laboratory the university of hong kong hong kong by the same person 16s rrna gene amplicons were then sequenced on the illumina miseq pe250 platform beijing genomics institute china finally 98 tap water samples were successfully amplified and generated 38 822 310 250 sequencing reads per sample biological triplicates of one tap were collected for bias assessment and four widely used dna extraction kits see table s1 for details were used to assess the impacts of kits on dna extractions additionally two of samples were selected to evaluate the biases associated with the use of primers with three different barcodes all the sequencing data are available at ncbi sequence read archive with accession number prjna506878 2 3 sequence processing sequences were analyzed using mothur software package version 1 35 1 by following the analysis protocol of miseq sop kozich et al 2013 the 16s rrna gene sequences of each sample were separated according to barcodes of primers and processed using mothur briefly paired end reads were merged into contigs using make contigs and any contig with ambiguous base and no longer than 275 bp was removed using screen seqs the filtered sequences were then aligned to silva database and filtered using the screen seqs command to ensure that the derived sequences were attributed to the 16s sequence v4 region subsequently chimera contigs were identified and removed using uchime edgar et al 2011 three negative controls were set up and treated equally to the samples along the entire laboratory process and used to determine putative contaminants schauberger et al 2021 contaminating otus were identified and filtered from the samples using decontam davis et al 2018 the sequencing depth of 16s rrna genes was normalized to 30 000 sequences per sample for comparative analyses and were clustered into otus based on a similarity threshold of 0 97 using qiime version 1 9 1 caporaso et al 2010 the α diversity and β diversity analysis was performed with qiime pipeline core diversity analyses py for representative sequences of each otu a taxonomy assignment was conducted using the uclust edgar 2010 to avoid biases cross sample singletons were removed edgar 2013 finally the matrix table of otus and their abundances in drinking water samples was generated for downstream analysis to excavate typical taxa and their distribution features in household drinking water four groups were further identified 1 dominant otus occurrence of 80 and average abundance 0 1 2 low abundant generalist otus occurrence of 50 but average abundance 0 1 3 specialist otus occurrence of 20 but average abundance 0 1 and 4 rare otus occurrence in only one sample 2 4 distance decay relationships the rate of the distance decay relationship ddr was calculated as the slope of a linear least squares regression analysis of the relationship between bacterial community composition similarities versus geographical distances for each pair of samples based on bray curtis dissimilarity martiny et al 2011 matrix permutation tests were then used to examine the statistical significance of the distance decay slope we also tested whether the spatial turnover rates on three spatial scales within cities across cities within provinces regions and across provinces regions differed significantly from the slope of the overall distance decay curve a matrix permutation test was performed using 999 permutations the ddr analysis was conducted using r version 3 5 3 packages vegan and geosphere and visualized using ggplot2 2 5

potential microbial source pools for downstream modeling our drinking water otus were repicked and subsampled to 10 000 sequences per sample to keep consistent and comparable with emp data wu et al 2019 and then merged with emp data according to otu ids the proportion of microbiota origins was estimated using sourcetracker knights et al 2011 the established model was validated by using leave one out test thompson et al 2017 with accuracy of 90 1 100 table s6 2 6 statistical analysis the rarefaction curves of otus were generated using mothur with the function rarefaction single the r package ggplot2 was used to visualize the dominant generalist specialist and rare bacterial otus in the drinking water samples the abundance occurrence and correlation of dominant genera average abundance 0 1 were evaluated using the r package canvasxpress zhang et al 2018 the phylogenetic tree was performed by mega 7 0 9 kumar et al 2016 and visualized by itol v3 letunic and bork 2016 network analysis was

principal coordinates analysis was performed based on the abundance matrix of otus using paleontological statistics software past version 3 09 based on bray curtis dissimilarity 3 results and discussion 3 1 bacterial diversity in the nationwide drinking water supply a total of 22 771 otus were observed in household drinking water samples collected from 38 cities across 29 provinces regions in china fig 1 a of which two otu id 4408397 and 2651333 were prevalent in all cities the microbial diversity in each sample ranged from 113 to 4018 otus with an average of 1080 otus to further clarify the distribution patterns of diverse otus in the drinking water samples the relative abundance and occurrence of all the observed bacterial otus were shown in fig 1b especially focusing on four typical groups dominant low abundant generalist specialist and rare otus we identified 10 dominant otus with occurrence of 80 and average abundance 0 1 and these accounted for 26 1 of the total abundance the dominant otus belonged to the phyla of proteobacteria actinobacteria and planctomycetes fig 1c the majority 80 of the dominant community members eight otus belonged to proteobacteria of which seven were classified as α proteobacteria among them otu id 4408397 annotated as a member of the order rhizobiales had the highest average abundance of 11 70 and was detected in 93 88 of samples table s3 similarly rhizobiales have been previously reported to be widely distributed in drinking water distribution systems especially dominant in biofilms chao et al 2015 treatment filter white et al 2012 disinfected drinking water and tap water wang et al 2018 rhizobiales were referred to be chlorine resistant which could be enriched by treatment process wang et al 2018 the high residence of rhizobiales in drinking water may be due to its utilization ability of a wide range of carbon sources under both aerobic and anoxic conditions pang and liu 2007 and capability of degrading source water contaminants including methyl parathion polyacrylamides metolachlor quaternary ammonium alcohols kaech et al 2005 qiu et al 2006 white et al 2012 additionally there observed 45 bacterial otus with a low average abundance 0 1 but detected in more than 50 of the samples and 14 specialist otus with a relatively high abundance of 0 1 but only detected in 20 of samples furthermore 21 2 of all otus n 4 832 were detected in only 1 sample these were identified as rare otus and accounted for only 0 72 of the total abundance 3 2 bacterial community composition bacterial phylum sixty seven bacterial phyla were detected in the household drinking water samples proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum with an average abundance of 64 3 followed by acinobacteria 8 5 and planctomycetes 7 1 fig 2 a the relative abundances of proteobacteria in the samples ranged from 17 4 to 99 7 fig 2b and the highest abundance was detected in macau in contrast the abundances of acinobacteria and planctomycetes in drinking water samples ranged from 0 03 to 53 6 and from 0 007 to 42 0 respectively six phyla were prevalent in all samples namely proteobacteria actinobacteria planctomycetes bacteroidetes firmicutes and acidobacteria fig 2c with average abundances of 0 83 64 3 although the abundance of thermi was relatively high in the drinking water samples the prevalence of this phylum was only 57 1 in contrast spirochaetes was sparsely abundant 0 02 but highly prevalent 84 7 these data indicate an uneven microbial distribution pattern in household drinking water samples bacterial genus of the 623 detected bacterial genera 45 7 were present in an average abundance of 0 1 and were considered dominant genera fig 3 five of these dominant genera sphingomonas mycobacterium novosphingobium sediminibacterium and hyphomicrobium were prevalent in all samples with average abundances of 1 16 6 59 to further determine the geophylogeny of the prevalent communities all representative sequences of the otus assigned to the five dominant genera were extracted and used to construct a phylogenetic tree based on the neighbor joining method fig s5 the results indicated a high level of phylogenetic diversity wherein 297 otus were assigned to sphingomonas n 82 mycobacterium n 47 novosphingobium n 48 sediminibacterium n 43 and hyphomicrobium n 77 significantly otu id 4423410 sphingomonas and otu id 2151333 mycobacterium were detected in 93 9 and 89 8 of the samples respectively whereas 34 otus 11 4 were detected in only one drinking water sample this indicated a high level of phylogenetic homology but in a specific differential distribution of drinking water microbiome correlations of bacterial taxa further correlation based network analyses of all observed genera revealed significant intercorrelations r 0 6 and p 0 01 among 17 bacterial genera attributed to 6 phyla fig s6a noticeably four genera attributed to firmicutes bacillus clostridium paenibacillus and turicibacter were positively correlated and accounted for 62 5 of firmicutes total abundance constituting module ii modularity 0 657 fig s6b reports indicated that firmicutes is abundant in drinking water biofilms hong et al 2010 roeselers et al 2015 and tap water khan et al 2016 the high correlation of these firmicutes spp in drinking water is likely because of the cannibalism mechanism that bacillus e g b subtilis exposed to a nutrient poor environment can produce a peptide toxin sporulation delaying protein sdp that kills other cells especially gram positive firmicutes spp and then uptake the nutrients released from dead cells lamsa et al 2012 this self protection mechanism further contributes to the formation of drinking water biofilms wherein bacillus spp can produce sdp to kill cells outside the biofilm and thus support their continued growth lamsa et al 2012 the observed high abundance of firmicutes spp and the newly revealed co occurrence patterns in drinking water together with corresponding interaction mechanisms lead us to recommend further studies on the contributions of these species to drinking water biofilms and the associated health risks 3 3 scale dependent microbial sharing and distance decay patterns the geographical differentials and community composition patterns are key for understanding the drinking water bacterial ecosystems we examined the microbial sharing patterns of drinking water samples based on the profiles of otu sharing frequencies between cities here 77 2029 otus were shared between these cities fig 4 a the highest level of sharing was observed between two cities separated by a distance of 500 km while the lowest was observed between two cities separated by 3500 km indicating a distance dependent sharing pattern this pattern was further confirmed by comparing the shared diversity with the geographic distances between cities km which revealed that the percentage of shared diversity significantly decreased as the distance increased p 0 001 fig 4b to further reveal the geographic differentials of household drinking water microbiome the fundamental distance decay relationship ddr analysis in microbial ecology was performed according to its concept and previous observations of diverse ecosystems e g soil sediment river activated sludge we hypothesized that 1 the similarity between drinking water communities would decrease as the geographical distance increased and the slope of the ddr curve would vary over different scales and 2 the spatial turnover rates might be lower in drinking water microbial communities than in non flowing ecosystems overall we found that the similarity in bacterial community composition between any two drinking water samples decreased as the geographic distance increased fig 4c which supported our first hypothesis spearman s correlation analysis yielded a correlation coefficient r of 0 397 p 0 001 with a ddr curve slope of 0 37 the spatial turnover rates indicated by the slopes of ddr linear curves followed the pattern of within cities across cities within a province region across provinces regions countering our second hypothesis that the overall spatial turnover rates of household drinking water communities were found higher than natural environments such as rivers liu et al 2018 sediment martiny et al 2011 soil fierer and jackson 2006 man made environments such as activated sludge wu et al 2019 and even drinking water reservoirs liu et al 2015 further compared with a recent study for identifying the microbial impacts of source water on tap water in china han et al 2020 our larger scale observation facilitated a more significant distance decay relationship p 0 001 r 0 397 than its observation p 0 018 r 0 074 these together indicated drinking water microbiome may be much impacted by complex environmental factors deserving further explorations 3 4 two environmental drivers of microbial community composition here the machine learning classification sourcetracker knights et al 2011 considering complex environmental niches which had been previously used for tracing source of bacterial communities e g activated sludge wu et al 2019 or biological pollutants e g antibiotic resistance genes li et al 2018 was employed to identify potential sources of drinking water bacterial communities fig s8a inspired by the results that freshwater 79 7 and air 11 0 environments are the main potential microbial origins of household drinking water or indicating their similarities and to further clarify the turnover of drinking water microbial communities we considered and tested two related probable environmental drivers water sources and precipitation to explore their effect patterns first china has a complex topography and the rivers that supply drinking water are numerous and form seven major complicated river systems according to the systems samples were classified into eight groups according to their sources yangtze river yellow river pearl river songhua river huai river haihe river liao river and others to avoid bias one sample was randomly selected for each city for differential test further for statistical analysis drinking water microbiome from those river systems covering samples from more than 3 cities were studied on their similarities by comparing intra group vs with all other samples notably the bacterial communities in the drinking water samples in sources of the yangtze river and pearl river the first and second highest runoff volumes in china differed significantly from those of other sources p 0 001 fig 5 a in contrast the yellow river and haihe river did not significantly affect community dissimilarity likely because northern china uses more groundwater than surface water which may diminish the microbiological effects of source rivers thus the water source rivers could differ the drinking water microbial communities especially in regions supplied by rivers with high runoff volumes and those rely mainly on surface water from an ecological perspective rainfall usually affects the local landscape and biodiversity pires et al 2018 however it remains unknown whether and how rainfall might influence the microbial community in drinking water to explore the probable effects of rainfall samples were classified into three groups according to chinese isohyetal lines based on the average annual rainfall aar arid region aar 400 mm semi humid region aar 400 800 mm and humid region aar 800 mm the comparisons of inter and intra groups based on drinking water community similarity fig 5b revealed that drinking water microbiome of arid region and humid region significantly differ with other groups p 0 001 to further validate the impacts of precipitation on the drinking water microbiome we correlated community similarity with rainfall differentials the aar data was obtained from national meteorological information center data cma cn the correlation analysis revealed that microbial similarity between samples significantly decreased as the aar differentials increased p 0 001 fig 5c these together indicated precipitation could be a key factor influencing drinking water community structure the movement and utilization of water resources via precipitation infiltration transpiration runoff and subsurface flow are widely considered as means of water distribution around the globe i e the global water cycle schlesinger and jasechko 2014 here the runoff freshwater and precipitation air were identified to be main factors shaping household drinking water microbial communities indicating that the global water cycle affects the household drinking water microbiome accordingly drinking water quality is a global health and safety concern rather than an issue restricted to a specific region country continent thus the effects of the global water cycle and global change on the household drinking water microbiome especially the associated health effects warrant further long term and global scale studies 3 5 health implications and perspectives 3 5 1 health implications from microbial diversity and communities microbial diversity of drinking water samples differed significantly from 113 to 4018 otus with an average of 1080 typically tibet inner mongolia heilongjiang xinjiang and hubei provinces had bacterial diversity levels of 2000 otus these levels were even significantly higher than the average diversity of activated sludge observed at the same sequencing depth jiang et al 2018 wu et al 2019 which is used for wastewater treatment and considered to be with high microbial diversity considering the observed high microbial diversity and recognized low ratio of culturable drinking water microbiome approximately 0 25 roeselers et al 2015 we suspected that the higher microbial diversity the more uncultured not well studied microbes in drinking water to confirm that we correlated diversity number of otus with percentage of unassigned otus and observed a strong correlation at genus level r 0 709 fig 6 a whether the high microbial diversity or those unknown communities may bring potential microbial contaminations or health risks warranted further researches moreover though only averagely 2 4 could be identified at bacterial species level for further identification of potential pathogens in household drinking water they were compared with the published pathogen list of human pathogenic species woolhouse and gowtage sequeria 2005 a total of 19 potential pathogenic species were identified in these household drinking water samples with 0 8 species and 0 1 2 of total relative abundance detected in each sample fig s11 acinetobacter johnsonii like 0 1 2 rhodococcus fascians like 0 0 29 and paenibacillus macerans like 0 0 06 were in the highest sample detection frequency fig 6b among all the 29 studied provinces regions samples of three provinces regions macau shanghai and shanxi were in absence of potential pathogenic species detection while tibet was in the highest average abundance of potential pathogenic species with 0 55 followed by guizhou 0 35 and yunnan 0 18 this indicated regional potential pathogenic risks of household drinking water 3 5 2 perspectives on identification of microbial contaminations household drinking water microbiome with potential to carry microbial contamination is largely related with human health pandey et al 2014 westrick et al 2010 our study identified that 59 3 of 16s sequences and 66 9 of bacterial otus were unassigned at genus level and even 1 32 of 16s sequences and 4 79 of bacterial otus were assigned as new phylum fig 6a whether these unassigned taxa are pathogenic or toxin producing are key for assessment of microbial contamination and health risks in drinking water the health risks associated from bacterial contamination in drinking water are mainly concerned on pathogenic bacteria while the toxins could be produced by drinking water microbiome are usually underestimated here 2 85 of bacterial communities were assigned to cyanobacteria and some species of cyanobacteria had been reported to produce types of cyanotoxins pandey et al 2014 15 5 of cyanobacteria spp could be assigned to 19 genera among which anabaena microcystis and planktothrix were frequently reported to produce microcystin cylindrospermopsin anatoxin a etc boopathi and ki 2014 thus the assessment of microbiological contamination in drinking water should cover a comprehensive profile of toxins producing bacteria and associated health impacts in the present study network analysis help reveal the correlations of bacterial taxa indicating their co occurrence patterns and potential symbiotic mechanisms these co occurrences may happen in case of quorum sensing abisado et al 2018 interactive utilization of organic matter morita 1997 cannibalism mechanism lamsa et al 2012 biofilm formation douterelo et al 2016 etc significantly those co occurred taxa may support the survival of pathogens toxins producing bacteria in such low nutrient environment mikhailov et al 2019 simoes and simoes 2013 thus more efforts are warranted in excavating the correlations of drinking water microbiome which will greatly support us to identify indicator for pathogens toxins producing bacteria and even toxins and also to understand their starvation survival mechanisms therefore a systematic evaluation of microbial contamination and associated potential risks in drinking water fig 7 requires a comprehensive identification of pathogenic bacteria toxins producing bacteria and bacterial correlations for both of the known and unassigned bacterial taxa based on which to catalogue a full profile of microbial contamination rank a priority list and formulate monitoring standards is necessary meanwhile clarification of impact factors or contributors could facilitate our overview and together to develop efficient control strategies for drinking water microbial safety management 4 conclusion drinking water safety especially at the point of use is a major public health concern and health risks may arise from the consumption of drinking water with microbiological contamination the present study systematically profiled the microbial diversity and biogeography of household drinking water and further examined their environmental drivers and potential health implications a total of 22 771 otus were observed from 110 household drinking water samples covering 38 cities of 29 provinces regions in china the spatial turnover of drinking water communities is found to be scale dependent and driven largely by rainfall and water source river the identified potential pathogenic species may have the possibility of causing health risks additionally research perspectives on systematic assessment of microbial health risks mainly pathogens toxins producing bacteria and bacterial correlations in household drinking water are proposed our optimized workflow novel findings and perspectives proposed herein are expected to facilitate future studies on microbial communities in drinking water and the underlying mechanisms and promote the global surveillance and assessment of microbial health risks in drinking water and public health framework optimization for disease prevention declaration of

16149,drinking water at the point of use harbors microorganisms that may pose potential risks to human health however the microbial diversity and health impacts of household drinking water are poorly understood since culture based methods only target on specific microorganisms and low biomass of drinking water hinders a high throughput profiling here we used an optimized workflow to efficiently collect microorganisms from low biomass drinking water and performed deep sequencing of 16s rrna genes to profile the bacterial diversity and biogeography of 110 household drinking water samples covering 38 cities of 29 provinces regions in china and further explored environmental drivers and potential health implications our analyses revealed a diverse drinking water community comprising a total of 22 771 operational taxonomic units otus the spatial turnover of drinking water communities is scale dependent and appears to be driven largely by rainfall and water source river the identified potential pathogenic species may have the possibility of causing health risks our novel insights enhance the current understanding of the diversity and biogeography of drinking water bacterial communities within a theoretical ecological framework and have further important implications for safe drinking water management and public health protection graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water microbial diversity biogeography public health 1 introduction the safety of drinking water is a major concern worldwide risks to human health may arise from consumption of drinking water contaminated with infectious agents cotruvo 2017 researchers have previously detected diverse human pathogens in drinking water such as the obligate pathogens vibrio cholera ferdous et al 2018 escherichia coli ikonen et al 2017 and shigella flexneri parist et al 2018 the opportunistic pathogen sphingomonas paucimobilis ryan and adley 2010 and even the emerging pathogen naegleria fowleri bartrand et al 2014 the problem of drinking water contamination is more serious in developing countries due to limited treatment processes and contaminated source water ferdous et al detected v cholerae in 10 of point of drinking water samples and 9 of source water samples collected in a low income urban community in bangladesh ferdous et al 2018 the prevalence of human pathogens in drinking water may be associated with serious diseases thus a comprehensive understanding of the microbial community in drinking water especially at the point of use is essential when making decisions regarding water management and increasing public accessibility to safe drinking water generally the microbiological monitoring of drinking water is specified by the world health organization and national practices which rely mainly on traditional culture based methods such as heterotrophic plate counts and selective plating of certain organisms allen et al 2004 however the general limitation of culture based methods is that they yield only a very small fraction approximately 0 25 of the microorganisms in drinking water environments roeselers et al 2015 van der wielen and van der kooij 2010 in recent years advances in genomic technologies have overcome this limitation by enabling the profiling of microbial communities based on high throughput sequencing hts and bioinformatics analyses of microbial 16s rrna genes facilitating in depth and comprehensive analyses of microbial communities ramirez et al 2018 thompson et al 2017 with the concerns related to drinking water safety considerable efforts were then paid to profile microbial communities in drinking water systems based on hts of 16s rrna genes and revealed the effects of treatment processes el chakhtoura et al 2018 han et al 2020 jia et al 2015 pinto et al 2012 pipe infrastructure ling et al 2018 roeselers et al 2015 and environmental conditions el chakhtoura et al 2018 ji et al 2017 on drinking water microbial community for household drinking water researchers had revealed the impacts of water source and treatment processes on tap water microbiome by non metric multidimensional scaling and source tracking analysis han et al 2020 roeselers et al 2015 nevertheless the current understanding of their link to public health is incomplete hull et al 2019 the low biomass sampling standardization and sample collection permission also hindered our comprehensive understanding recently with the increasing concerns to public health researchers appealed for a global drinking water microbiome project hull et al 2019 and highlighted the urgent needs on large scale study for comprehensive spatiotemporal understanding of drinking water microbiome considering the present patchwork of knowledge makes it difficult to assess the associated health risks and determine comprehensive control strategies consequently microbiological surveillance efforts intended to provide safe drinking water require a comprehensive understanding of the diversity and biogeography of the household drinking water microbiome based on which to assess the potential risks to public health and conduct microbiological safety management for drinking water in this study we used an optimized method to efficiently collect microorganisms from low biomass household drinking water and profiled bacterial communities of household drinking water samples collected from 38 cities in 29 provinces regions of china by deep sequencing of 16s rrna genes to 1 understand the diversity and biogeography of the bacterial communities in large scale household drinking water samples 2 to investigate the key environmental drivers that shape the diversity and biogeography of drinking water microbial communities and further 3 to explore the potential effects of household drinking water microbiome on human health 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and pretreatment a total of 110 tap water samples were collected from households in 38 cities of 29 provinces regions in china during december 2014 to march 2015 the detailed sample information e g sample id sampling location and sampling date is listed in table s1 to solve the problem of extremely low biomass in tap water that usually does not meet the requirement of high throughput sequencing and is an obstacle to profile bacterial diversity we optimized the sample collection and pretreatment process from our previous study chao et al 2013 to more effectively collect microorganisms from drinking water see details in fig s7 microorganisms in each sample were collected by filtering tap water through high performance cartridge type water purifiers torayvino toray industries inc japan three purifiers not exposed to tap water served as the blank samples microbial cells were then detached from the hollow fiber filters within the purifiers into ultrapure water via ultrasonication branson ultrasonics corp usa and were subsequently collected by filtration using a 0 45 μm cellulose ester membrane millipore corp usa ma et al 2017 the membranes were then stored at 20 c prior to dna extraction 2 2 dna extraction and illumina miseq sequencing of the 16s rrna genes genomic dna was extracted of each sample using fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals france according to the standard protocol subsequently dna concentration was measured using a qubit 2 0 fluorometer invitrogen life techniques usa the dna concentrations in the three blank samples were below the detection limit the v4 region 265 nucleotides of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using f515 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and r806 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 primers and a dual index sequencing strategy table s2 the pcr conditions were as follows an initial denaturation at 95 c for 2 min followed by 30 cycles at 95 c for 20 s 55 c for 15 s and 72 c for 5 min with a final extension at 72 c for 10 min kozich et al 2013 all of the pcrs were performed in triplicate to avoid the bias of unequal amplification acinas et al 2005 and the purified amplicons were pooled all the experiments were conducted in one lab environmental microbiome engineering and biotechnology laboratory the university of hong kong hong kong by the same person 16s rrna gene amplicons were then sequenced on the illumina miseq pe250 platform beijing genomics institute china finally 98 tap water samples were successfully amplified and generated 38 822 310 250 sequencing reads per sample biological triplicates of one tap were collected for bias assessment and four widely used dna extraction kits see table s1 for details were used to assess the impacts of kits on dna extractions additionally two of samples were selected to evaluate the biases associated with the use of primers with three different barcodes all the sequencing data are available at ncbi sequence read archive with accession number prjna506878 2 3 sequence processing sequences were analyzed using mothur software package version 1 35 1 by following the analysis protocol of miseq sop kozich et al 2013 the 16s rrna gene sequences of each sample were separated according to barcodes of primers and processed using mothur briefly paired end reads were merged into contigs using make contigs and any contig with ambiguous base and no longer than 275 bp was removed using screen seqs the filtered sequences were then aligned to silva database and filtered using the screen seqs command to ensure that the derived sequences were attributed to the 16s sequence v4 region subsequently chimera contigs were identified and removed using uchime edgar et al 2011 three negative controls were set up and treated equally to the samples along the entire laboratory process and used to determine putative contaminants schauberger et al 2021 contaminating otus were identified and filtered from the samples using decontam davis et al 2018 the sequencing depth of 16s rrna genes was normalized to 30 000 sequences per sample for comparative analyses and were clustered into otus based on a similarity threshold of 0 97 using qiime version 1 9 1 caporaso et al 2010 the α diversity and β diversity analysis was performed with qiime pipeline core diversity analyses py for representative sequences of each otu a taxonomy assignment was conducted using the uclust edgar 2010 to avoid biases cross sample singletons were removed edgar 2013 finally the matrix table of otus and their abundances in drinking water samples was generated for downstream analysis to excavate typical taxa and their distribution features in household drinking water four groups were further identified 1 dominant otus occurrence of 80 and average abundance 0 1 2 low abundant generalist otus occurrence of 50 but average abundance 0 1 3 specialist otus occurrence of 20 but average abundance 0 1 and 4 rare otus occurrence in only one sample 2 4 distance decay relationships the rate of the distance decay relationship ddr was calculated as the slope of a linear least squares regression analysis of the relationship between bacterial community composition similarities versus geographical distances for each pair of samples based on bray curtis dissimilarity martiny et al 2011 matrix permutation tests were then used to examine the statistical significance of the distance decay slope we also tested whether the spatial turnover rates on three spatial scales within cities across cities within provinces regions and across provinces regions differed significantly from the slope of the overall distance decay curve a matrix permutation test was performed using 999 permutations the ddr analysis was conducted using r version 3 5 3 packages vegan and geosphere and visualized using ggplot2 2 5 microbial source tracking to conduct microbial source tracking we downloaded the otu table of 16s rrna gene amplicon studies from the earth microbiome project emp emp cr gg 13 8 subset 5k biom thompson et al 2017 a total of 2180 environmental samples that were explicitly attributable to freshwater n 462 ocean n 469 soil n 338 air n 81 animal feces n 789 or human feces n 41 were selected as potential microbial source pools for downstream modeling our drinking water otus were repicked and subsampled to 10 000 sequences per sample to keep consistent and comparable with emp data wu et al

principal coordinates analysis was performed based on the abundance matrix of otus using paleontological statistics software past version 3 09 based on bray curtis dissimilarity 3 results and discussion 3 1 bacterial diversity in the nationwide drinking water supply a total of 22 771 otus were observed in household drinking water samples collected from 38 cities across 29 provinces regions in china fig 1 a of which two otu id 4408397 and 2651333 were prevalent in all cities the microbial diversity in each sample ranged from 113 to 4018 otus with an average of 1080 otus to further clarify the distribution patterns of diverse otus in the drinking water samples the relative abundance and occurrence of all the observed bacterial otus were shown in fig 1b especially focusing on four typical groups dominant low abundant generalist specialist and rare otus we identified 10 dominant otus with occurrence of 80 and average abundance 0 1 and these accounted for 26 1 of the total abundance the dominant otus belonged to the phyla of proteobacteria actinobacteria and planctomycetes fig 1c the majority 80 of the dominant community members eight otus belonged to proteobacteria of which seven were classified as α proteobacteria among them otu id 4408397 annotated as a member of the order rhizobiales had the highest average abundance of 11 70 and was detected in 93 88 of samples table s3 similarly rhizobiales have been previously reported to be widely distributed in drinking water distribution systems especially dominant in biofilms chao et al 2015 treatment filter white et al 2012 disinfected drinking water and tap water wang et al 2018 rhizobiales were referred to be chlorine resistant which could be enriched by treatment process wang et al 2018 the high residence of rhizobiales in drinking water may be due to its utilization ability of a wide range of carbon sources under both aerobic and anoxic conditions pang and liu 2007 and capability of degrading source water contaminants including methyl parathion polyacrylamides metolachlor quaternary ammonium alcohols kaech et al 2005 qiu et al 2006 white et al 2012 additionally there observed 45 bacterial otus with a low average abundance 0 1 but detected in more than 50 of the samples and 14 specialist otus with a relatively high abundance of 0 1 but only detected in 20 of samples furthermore 21 2 of all otus n 4 832 were detected in only 1 sample these were identified as rare otus and accounted for only 0 72 of the total abundance 3 2 bacterial community composition bacterial phylum sixty seven bacterial phyla were detected in the household drinking water samples proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum with an average abundance of 64 3 followed by acinobacteria 8 5 and planctomycetes 7 1 fig 2 a the relative abundances of proteobacteria in the samples ranged from 17 4 to 99 7 fig 2b and the highest abundance was detected in macau in contrast the abundances of acinobacteria and planctomycetes in drinking water samples ranged from 0 03 to 53 6 and from 0 007 to 42 0 respectively six phyla were prevalent in all samples namely proteobacteria actinobacteria planctomycetes bacteroidetes firmicutes and acidobacteria fig 2c with average abundances of 0 83 64 3 although the abundance of thermi was relatively high in the drinking water samples the prevalence of this phylum was only 57 1 in contrast spirochaetes was sparsely abundant 0 02 but highly prevalent 84 7 these data indicate an uneven microbial distribution pattern in household drinking water samples bacterial genus of the 623 detected bacterial genera 45 7 were present in an average abundance of 0 1 and were considered dominant genera fig 3 five of these dominant genera sphingomonas mycobacterium novosphingobium sediminibacterium and hyphomicrobium were prevalent in all samples with average abundances of 1 16 6 59 to further determine the geophylogeny of the prevalent communities all representative sequences of the otus assigned to the five dominant genera were extracted and used to construct a phylogenetic tree based on the neighbor joining method fig s5 the results indicated a high level of phylogenetic diversity wherein 297 otus were assigned to sphingomonas n 82 mycobacterium n 47 novosphingobium n 48 sediminibacterium n 43 and hyphomicrobium n 77 significantly otu id 4423410 sphingomonas and otu id 2151333 mycobacterium were detected in 93 9 and 89 8 of the samples respectively whereas 34 otus 11 4 were detected in only one drinking water sample this indicated a high level of phylogenetic homology but in a specific differential distribution of drinking water microbiome correlations of bacterial taxa further correlation based network analyses of all observed genera revealed significant intercorrelations r 0 6 and p 0 01 among 17 bacterial genera attributed to 6 phyla fig s6a noticeably four genera attributed to firmicutes bacillus clostridium paenibacillus and turicibacter were positively correlated and accounted for 62 5 of firmicutes total abundance constituting module ii modularity 0 657 fig s6b reports indicated that firmicutes is abundant in drinking water biofilms hong et al 2010 roeselers et al 2015 and tap water khan et al 2016 the high correlation of these firmicutes spp in drinking water is likely because of the cannibalism mechanism that bacillus e g b subtilis exposed to a nutrient poor environment can produce a peptide toxin sporulation delaying protein sdp that kills other cells especially gram positive firmicutes spp and then uptake the nutrients released from dead cells lamsa et al 2012 this self protection mechanism further contributes to the formation of drinking water biofilms wherein bacillus spp can produce sdp to kill cells outside the biofilm and thus support their continued growth lamsa et al 2012 the observed high abundance of firmicutes spp and the newly revealed co occurrence patterns in drinking water together with corresponding interaction mechanisms lead us to recommend further studies on the contributions of these species to drinking water biofilms and the associated health risks 3 3 scale dependent microbial sharing and distance decay patterns the geographical differentials and community composition patterns are key for understanding the drinking water bacterial ecosystems we examined the microbial sharing patterns of drinking water samples based on the profiles of otu sharing frequencies between cities here 77 2029 otus were shared between these cities fig 4 a the highest level of sharing was observed between two cities separated by a distance of 500 km while the lowest was observed between two cities separated by 3500 km indicating a distance dependent sharing pattern this pattern was further confirmed by comparing the shared diversity with the geographic distances between cities km which revealed that the percentage of shared diversity significantly decreased as the distance increased p 0 001 fig 4b to further reveal the geographic differentials of household drinking water microbiome the fundamental distance decay relationship ddr analysis in microbial ecology was performed according to its concept and previous observations of diverse ecosystems e g soil sediment river activated sludge we hypothesized that 1 the similarity between drinking water communities would decrease as the geographical distance increased and the slope of the ddr curve would vary over different scales and 2 the spatial turnover rates might be lower in drinking water microbial communities than in non flowing ecosystems overall we found that the similarity in bacterial community composition between any two drinking water samples decreased as the geographic distance increased fig 4c which supported our first hypothesis spearman s correlation analysis yielded a correlation coefficient r of 0 397 p 0 001 with a ddr curve slope of 0 37 the spatial turnover rates indicated by the slopes of ddr linear curves followed the pattern of within cities across cities within a province region across provinces regions countering our second hypothesis that the overall spatial turnover rates of household drinking water communities were found higher than natural environments such as rivers liu et al 2018 sediment martiny et al 2011 soil fierer and jackson 2006 man made environments such as activated sludge wu et al 2019 and even drinking water reservoirs liu et al 2015 further compared with a recent study for identifying the microbial impacts of source water on tap water in china han et al 2020 our larger scale observation facilitated a more significant distance decay relationship p 0 001 r 0 397 than its observation p 0 018 r 0 074 these together indicated drinking water microbiome may be much impacted by complex environmental factors deserving further explorations 3 4 two environmental drivers of microbial community composition here the machine learning classification sourcetracker knights et al 2011 considering complex environmental niches which had been previously used for tracing source of bacterial communities e g activated sludge wu et al 2019 or biological pollutants e g antibiotic resistance genes li et al 2018 was employed to identify potential sources of drinking water bacterial communities fig s8a inspired by the results that freshwater 79 7 and air 11 0 environments are the main potential microbial origins of household drinking water or indicating their similarities and to further clarify the turnover of drinking water microbial communities we considered and tested two related probable environmental drivers water sources and precipitation to explore their effect patterns first china has a complex topography and the rivers that supply drinking water are numerous and form seven major complicated river systems according to the systems samples were classified into eight groups according to their sources yangtze river yellow river pearl river songhua river huai river haihe river liao river and others to avoid bias one sample was randomly selected for each city for differential test further for statistical analysis drinking water microbiome from those river systems covering samples from more than 3 cities were studied on their similarities by comparing intra group vs with all other samples notably the bacterial communities in the drinking water samples in sources of the yangtze river and pearl river the first and second highest runoff volumes in china differed significantly from those of other sources p 0 001 fig 5 a in contrast the yellow river and haihe river did not significantly affect community dissimilarity likely because northern china uses more groundwater than surface water which may diminish the microbiological effects of source rivers thus the water source rivers could differ the drinking water microbial communities especially in regions supplied by rivers with high runoff volumes and those rely mainly on surface water from an ecological perspective rainfall usually affects the local landscape and biodiversity pires et al 2018 however it remains unknown whether and how rainfall might influence the microbial community in drinking water to explore the probable effects of rainfall samples were classified into three groups according to chinese isohyetal lines based on the average annual rainfall aar arid region aar 400 mm semi humid region aar 400 800 mm and humid region aar 800 mm the comparisons of inter and intra groups based on drinking water community similarity fig 5b revealed that drinking water microbiome of arid region and humid region significantly differ with other groups p 0 001 to further validate the impacts of precipitation on the drinking water microbiome we correlated community similarity with rainfall differentials the aar data was obtained from national meteorological information center data cma cn the correlation analysis revealed that microbial similarity between samples significantly decreased as the aar differentials increased p 0 001 fig 5c these together indicated precipitation could be a key factor influencing drinking water community structure the movement and utilization of water resources via precipitation infiltration transpiration runoff and subsurface flow are widely considered as means of water distribution around the globe i e the global water cycle schlesinger and jasechko 2014 here the runoff freshwater and precipitation air were identified to be main factors shaping household drinking water microbial communities indicating that the global water cycle affects the household drinking water microbiome accordingly drinking water quality is a global health and safety concern rather than an issue restricted to a specific region country continent thus the effects of the global water cycle and global change on the household drinking water microbiome especially the associated health effects warrant further long term and global scale studies 3 5 health implications and perspectives 3 5 1 health implications from microbial diversity and communities microbial diversity of drinking water samples differed significantly from 113 to 4018 otus with an average of 1080 typically tibet inner mongolia heilongjiang xinjiang and hubei provinces had bacterial diversity levels of 2000 otus these levels were even significantly higher than the average diversity of activated sludge observed at the same sequencing depth jiang et al 2018 wu et al 2019 which is used for wastewater treatment and considered to be with high microbial diversity considering the observed high microbial diversity and recognized low ratio of culturable drinking water microbiome approximately 0 25 roeselers et al 2015 we suspected that the higher microbial diversity the more uncultured not well studied microbes in drinking water to confirm that we correlated diversity number of otus with percentage of unassigned otus and observed a strong correlation at genus level r 0 709 fig 6 a whether the high microbial diversity or those unknown communities may bring potential microbial contaminations or health risks warranted further researches moreover though only averagely 2 4 could be identified at bacterial species level for further identification of potential pathogens in household drinking water they were compared with the published pathogen list of human pathogenic species woolhouse and gowtage sequeria 2005 a total of 19 potential pathogenic species were identified in these household drinking water samples with 0 8 species and 0 1 2 of total relative abundance detected in each sample fig s11 acinetobacter johnsonii like 0 1 2 rhodococcus fascians like 0 0 29 and paenibacillus macerans like 0 0 06 were in the highest sample detection frequency fig 6b among all the 29 studied provinces regions samples of three provinces regions macau shanghai and shanxi were in absence of potential pathogenic species detection while tibet was in the highest average abundance of potential pathogenic species with 0 55 followed by guizhou 0 35 and yunnan 0 18 this indicated regional potential pathogenic risks of household drinking water 3 5 2 perspectives on identification of microbial contaminations household drinking water microbiome with potential to carry microbial contamination is largely related with human health pandey et al 2014 westrick et al 2010 our study identified that 59 3 of 16s sequences and 66 9 of bacterial otus were unassigned at genus level and even 1 32 of 16s sequences and 4 79 of bacterial otus were assigned as new phylum fig 6a whether these unassigned taxa are pathogenic or toxin producing are key for assessment of microbial contamination and health risks in drinking water the health risks associated from bacterial contamination in drinking water are mainly concerned on pathogenic bacteria while the toxins could be produced by drinking water microbiome are usually underestimated here 2 85 of bacterial communities were assigned to cyanobacteria and some species of cyanobacteria had been reported to produce types of cyanotoxins pandey et al 2014 15 5 of cyanobacteria spp could be assigned to 19 genera among which anabaena microcystis and planktothrix were frequently reported to produce microcystin cylindrospermopsin anatoxin a etc boopathi and ki 2014 thus the assessment of microbiological contamination in drinking water should cover a comprehensive profile of toxins producing bacteria and associated health impacts in the present study network analysis help reveal the correlations of bacterial taxa indicating their co occurrence patterns and potential symbiotic mechanisms these co occurrences may happen in case of quorum sensing abisado et al 2018 interactive utilization of organic matter morita 1997 cannibalism mechanism lamsa et al 2012 biofilm formation douterelo et al 2016 etc significantly those co occurred taxa may support the survival of pathogens toxins producing bacteria in such low nutrient environment mikhailov et al 2019 simoes and simoes 2013 thus more efforts are warranted in excavating the correlations of drinking water microbiome which will greatly support us to identify indicator for pathogens toxins producing bacteria and even toxins and also to understand their starvation survival mechanisms therefore a systematic evaluation of microbial contamination and associated potential risks in drinking water fig 7 requires a comprehensive identification of pathogenic bacteria toxins producing bacteria and bacterial correlations for both of the known and unassigned bacterial taxa based on which to catalogue a full profile of microbial contamination rank a priority list and formulate monitoring standards is necessary meanwhile clarification of impact factors or contributors could facilitate our overview and together to develop efficient control strategies for drinking water microbial safety management 4 conclusion drinking water safety especially at the point of use is a major public health concern and health risks may arise from the consumption of drinking water with microbiological contamination the present study systematically profiled the microbial diversity and biogeography of household drinking water and further examined their environmental drivers and potential health implications a total of 22 771 otus were observed from 110 household drinking water samples covering 38 cities of 29 provinces regions in china the spatial turnover of drinking water communities is found to be scale dependent and driven largely by rainfall and water source river the identified potential pathogenic species may have the possibility of causing health risks additionally research perspectives on systematic assessment of microbial health risks mainly pathogens toxins producing bacteria and bacterial correlations in household drinking water are proposed our optimized workflow novel findings and perspectives proposed herein are expected to facilitate future studies on microbial communities in drinking water and the underlying mechanisms and promote the global surveillance and assessment of microbial health risks in drinking water and public health framework optimization for disease prevention declaration of
