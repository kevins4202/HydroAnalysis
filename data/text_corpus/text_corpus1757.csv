8785,this paper provides an extended input output io model of sectoral water consumption for bali a province located in indonesia that is a well known global tourist destination currently the province is experiencing water shortages which leads to a burden and heavy competition in water usage among the various economic sectors we developed a method for determining which industrial economic sectors directly and indirectly consume the most substantial quantities of water and to what extent available water resources can become a restrictive factor in the development of leading economic sectors we also used another method backward and forward linkage indices to identify the key sectors influencing water consumption the results confirm that the agriculture sectors including other food crops non food crops and rice consume the highest portion of total water consumption however indirect water consumption appears to comprise a vital share of total water resources these sectors including the livestock industry food beverage tobacco and coffee industries the timber industry wood products crafts and minerals industry trading construction and other processing industries have the highest indirect consumption our model for direct and indirect water consumption is a useful tool for water and economic planning policymakers for devising water saving policies and expanding the provincial

roadmap idr indonesian rupiah 1 introduction water plays a critical role in society and is a vital driving force behind economic growth along with other regions of the world the asia pacific region is confronting major freshwater water resource glitches due to the increasing population rapid urbanization and economic development 21 67 the region faces inconsistency of demand to enhance agriculture industrial and energy production with a diminishing per capita water availability 2 indonesia is among the asian nations that are significantly affected by droughts and floods in various administrative provinces currently the country is facing intensifying freshwater supply issues predominantly on java and sumatra islands where the demand for freshwater is the highest the problems related to freshwater shortages are population growth industrialization overuse urbanization and the insufficient supply of water in some provinces e g bali and regions 59 the island of bali a well known tourist destination is one of 34 indonesian provinces covering a geographical area of 5 636 kilometers km2 according to bali province statistics the economy has become reliant on the tourism sector which is renowned for its overuse of water resources while agriculture is still the primary user of water the water use of domestic households and the tourism industry as well as other industrial water users is currently increasing the balinese water supply is restricted because of massive stretches of coastland with sensitive and restricted groundwater potential compared to the small size of the island and its dense population 4 19 the water supply is considered critical to the high population density and tourism infrastructure and a 70 upsurge in water consumption is projected in all regencies including south bali of denpasar badung and others see fig 1 by 2025 3 31 57 under these challenges water is progressively becoming a priority policy issue on an international national and regional level in 2012 the fourth edition of the world water report 67 recognized the importance of robust governance mechanisms are necessary to protect water resource and ensure sustainable development and equitable distribution of water derived benefits p 2 evaluating the demand of the various sectors requires a comprehensive understanding of the issues this paper will address some of these issues focusing on the interrelationship between the consumption of water and the production structure in bali this paper is organized as follows the first section provides a brief introduction states the importance of the economic situation and water resource in bali province and water consumption of multiple sectors and reviews the literature on water extended io model followed by the objectives sections 2 and 3 present the methodological framework including the water io framework water consumption multipliers and backward and forward linkages followed by a description of the regional economic and water data section 4 presents the results and discussion section 5 presents the limitations of the study finally the policy implications and future directions are presented in the last section 1 1 importance of the economic situation and water resources in bali the province of bali has been historically dominated by the agricultural sector which is a major economic driver for the province in 1969 the agrarian sector contributed 61 21 of bali s gross regional domestic product grdp 7 8 10 18 66 fig 2 illustrates that as of 2018 the contribution of the primary sector agriculture to the grdp decreased to 13 78 a major recent development in the balinese economy has been the expansion of the trade and service sectors the tourism sector accommodation food service activities has increased from contributing 9 59 in 1969 to 18 20 in 2005 and 23 33 in 2018 swiftly taking over the balinese economy 66 predominantly these distributions clearly demonstrate that the tourism sector has become a driving force in bali s economic development and a significant economic boost for bali province the transportation industry crucial for scaling up tourism accounted for 7 39 in 2010 and 9 74 in 2018 followed by the construction industry which reports increasing from 4 03 in 2005 to 9 39 in 2018 the trade restaurants and hotels sector makes a significant contribution not only to the economy but also to employment representing 31 69 760 093 jobs in 2017 7 bps 2018 the dominant tourism associated industries have been recognized as placing a considerable burden on water supplies and competing with local users as well as surpassing agriculture in terms of its contribution to the grdp 4 23 32 46 this creates an imbalance between sectors due to the higher water consumption of the tourism sector which reportedly consumes 65 of all local water resources 13 1 1 1 freshwater resources by regency in bali water is important to the development of economic activity and vital for sustaining life and livelihoods as well as having religious and cultural significance the province of bali s annual rainfall differs because of climatological changes and is less than 1 500 mm in the coastal zone and 3 000 mm in the mountainous areas 53 siska 2018 the main freshwater resources for the bali province are groundwater 40 0 followed by springs 28 7 rivers 25 0 and others 5 3 the regencies of denpasar and badung have 44 5 of all freshwater resources while buleleng tabanan gianyar and klungkung regencies have 40 3 the remaining regencies of jembrana bangli and karangasem comprises 15 2 of all freshwater resources see table 1 as we can see the sources of freshwater resources are unevenly distributed across the province of bali according to the ministry of public works 2015 several rivers in the province of bali are perennial rivers that account for 41 0 some do not flow during the dry season and only 21 0 of rivers flow during the wet season cited in siska 2018 53 40 however the regencies of denpasar gianyar and jembrana followed by buleleng and badung consume more groundwater resources which may be the reason for maintaining the water demand for the tourism sector for daily activities including swimming pools and gardens according to the food and agriculture organisation fao 2003 bali s water supply is compromised because of massive areas of coastland with sensitive and limited groundwater potential relative to the small size of the bali island and its dense population cited in ref 55 strauβ 2011 19 in addition a limited water supply occurred during the months of july and october due to because of shortage of rainfall that creates water stress and intensify the water demand between the local communities and economic sectors in this way the water allocation problems caused by the high rate of population density and as well as the competition among dominant economic sectors of agriculture tourism and other sectors would lead to severe problems with the water supply 4 55 therefore it is indispensable to seek new options for managing the available water resources in a sustainable manner 1 1 2 water use for different sectors the composition of water use in bali has increased 1 1 0 02 billion cubic meters m3 as a whole however the distribution of water use between agriculture domestic users and the tourism industry changed from 92 7 and 1 respectively in 1994 to 88 10 and 2 respectively in 2013 water use for agriculture exhibited a fluctuating trend between 1994 and 2014 decreasing from 1994 2003 and then increasing between 2003 2014 due to growth in rice production 53 the perusahaan daerah air minum pdam is a local government owned water utility whose responsibility it is to provide clean water supply to various sectors except the agricultural sector appendix 1 the rising population density caused an increase in water consumption by households i e the domestic sector from 67 7 in 2009 to 75 0 in 2015 followed by trade companies from 8 0 in 2009 to 11 2 in 2019 which includes multiple services such as star and non hotels restaurants and showrooms etc the water use by the manufacturing sector includes food and beverage and textile chemical and as shown in fig 3 other industries declined from 5 7 in 2009 to 4 7 in 2015 earlier studies e g cole 2012 suriyani 2015 trisnawati 2012 have reported that tourism consumes 65 of all local water resources which creates conflict between the hotel industry and local communities 13 56 58 according to tourism concern 2012 the changes in water supply distribution in favor of tourism raise questions regarding water quality and equity between the various economic sectors trade companies and domestic users 42 sometimes conflicts arise between farmers and pdam and local communities over clean water siska et al 2018 argued that there is a misunderstanding between water users on the level of water availability and allocation among sectors predominantly as a result of the recent rapid development in tourism 53 therefore by addressing these issues and the water challenges between the different sectors in the province of bali this study will determine precisely which sectors consume more water both directly and indirectly by using an extended io framework so that the findings can provide better solutions for the management of water resources 1 2 review of literature the leontief io model is a valuable tool for structural analysis and is widely used in the global academic community several studies have used this tool to analyze economic structures and their physical impact on the environment such as energy consumption environmental pollution and water pollution the application of the io model to environmental interactions the cost of economic industries and final demand categories were first introduced in 1966 by cumberland cited in ref 62 70 later in 1970 leontief extended the io model to analyze environmental issues by adding new rows or corresponding columns to accommodate new production inputs or outputs 36 proops 1977 used the extended io model to set up a range of indicators of both direct and indirect energy use 47 several researchers have used an extended io model to study energy consumption and atmospheric pollutant related issues 1 15 20 33 41 51 52 71 from an economic perspective the application of io analysis to water resources has received limited attention studies that use the io framework are even fewer in earlier studies harris and rea 1984 cited in ref 43 conducted a water allocation study in the united states us 25 and in 1992 sanchez choliz et al cited in ref 61 applied the io methodology to spain 50 only a few studies have assessed the effects of economic production structures and domestic demand on natural water resources especially in water threatened regions and countries 6 11 16 24 28 34 35 63 65 68 69 using an environmental water extended io eeio framework hristov 2016 concluded that because of the seasonal and spatial distribution of water resources in the western balkan region the sustainable management of water resources is crucial in macedonia 77 the eeio analysis supports data on environmental economic and water policies by quantifying how the demand for goods and services leads to resource use in the economy 74 76 moreover the eeio framework provides a high resolution of sectors and structural economic composition which makes it a useful tool for supply chain impact assessment 78 recently several io studies have been conducted about water resources in china 11 14 24 28 38 for instance wang et al 2009 developed a method to identify the relationship between production activities and the related water consumption in zhangya city an arid area of northwestern china which is categorized as a water shortage area 64 however the situation in china is not the same as that in other developing asian nations ono et al 2017 developed a water consumption inventory database that focused on investigating asian water use with an io framework 44 the data inventory is quite useful for countries like indonesia for assessing the relationship between economic activity and water consumption bogra et al 2016 described a water withdrawal io model by combining data about direct water withdrawal attained from various sources using a 2003 2004 economic io table 5 furthermore they estimated the direct and indirect water withdrawal of all industrial sectors in india pavisorn et al 2018 used an io model to assess the relationship between water use and thailand s economic structure 45 čegar 2020 constructed a water extended io model and empirically applied it to his study using the indicators of direct indirect and quantified cumulative water intensity of production sectors including indirect water use multipliers in the croatian economy 79 with regard to indonesia most studies using an io framework focus on structural changes in economic industries and trade 26 72 73 for example dwiatmoko et al 2019 used io analysis to investigate the effect of railway development on the indonesian national economy 17 moreover james and fujita 2000 used io tables to estimate the employment effects of manufactured exports in two sub periods 30 budy resosudarmo 2003 used io analysis to conduct research to identify policies to solve river water pollution in indonesia 49 with this background we found that no study used io tables to examine the province of bali or other indonesian provinces moreover the current water resources situation in bali province 53 55 particularly the higher water use competition among industrial sectors e g the agriculture and tourism sectors leads to conflicts among stakeholders therefore to fill the gaps mentioned above this study develops a water io table for bali province to explore the interrelationship between the economic sectors that consume the highest amount of water both directly and indirectly this study is the first attempt to use the water extended io method to quantify how demand for goods and services in these sectors leads to water use in the bali provincial economy it is also the first study about indonesia and other developing nations in asia except china in addition this study has significant practical implications for asian countries and others that have similar water competition situations the foremost objective of this study is to examine the relationship between the various economic sectors and their physical relationship with water consumption the appropriate method for analyzing the direct and indirect as well as the intersectoral water relationships in an economy is the extended leontief io model 39 while extending the model for water use 61 second this study also attempts to determine the sectors that consume the highest amount of water both directly and indirectly to explore the key sectors that have the most significant effect on the entire water consumption process in terms of both purchases and sales in the economy this study employs backward and forward linkages 70 the conclusions of this study will elucidate better solutions to facilitate the design of sustainable water use policies at the provincial level and address the intensifying competition for water among various economic sectors 2 methodology to achieve the sustainable use of water resources the construction of an io table is indubitably important for examining the relationship between economic sectors and water consumption in this paper we adopt a traditional leontief io model and extend it in terms of water consumption 2 1 conventional io production model the fundamental leontief io model is normally constructed from observed economic data for a country region or province and a specific time period io analysis is concerned with according to miller and blair 2009 the activity of a group of industrial sectors that both produce of goods outputs and consume goods from other industrial sectors inputs in the process of producing each industry s own output 39 p 2 in table 2 the extra column categorized as final demand comprises of household and government consumption capital investments and net exports of goods and services which represents the sales by each sector to final markets to use for production the additional row labeled value added accounts for other non industrial inputs to production such as labor depreciation of capital indirect business taxes and imports 39 the io model consists of a set of linear equations the basic equation in the leontief model determines that the production of an economy depends on intersectoral relations and final demand 1 x i j 1 n x i j d i where x i j represents the values of the transactions from each sector i to sector j and d i denotes the final demand for goods for each sector this equation can be rewritten to incorporate the technical coefficients of production a i j which are described as the purchases that sector j makes from sector i per total effective production unit of sector j which represents the direct input required by sector j 2 a i j x i j x j 3 x i j 1 n a i j x j d i in matrix notation for the entire economy it becomes 4 x a x d to solve for x we obtain the total production delivered to final demand 5 x i a 1 d where i a 1 is known as the leontief inverse matrix or the total requirement matrix representing the total production that every sector must generate to satisfy the final demand of the economy for further expression of equation 5 the production of sector i can be specified as follows 6 x i j 1 n β i j d i where β i j are the elements in the leontief inverse matrix i a 1 describes the increase in production generated by sector i if the demand of sector j increases by one unit the column sums of this matrix express the total direct and indirect requirements of a sector to meet its final demand the diagonal elements in the matrix are the direct effect and the column sum of the off diagonal elements equals the indirect effect 2 2 water input output model 2 2 1 the extended io model of water consumption as we elucidated in an earlier section the extension of the conventional method is done in terms of water consumption it is completed by adding an additional row ω in which physical data on each sector s water use is considered as a production factor this model defines total water consumption and differentiates between direct and indirect water consumption these concepts can be presented in the model which allows us to formulate a matrix of intersectoral water relationships and analyze the relative importance of direct and indirect water consumption 61 hereafter production vector x j data are expressed in monetary units the indicator of total direct consumption per unit produced ω j can be defined by dividing the water consumed directly by each sector ω j with total input to that sector x j this expression as a column vector is defined as follows 7 ω j ω j x j in matrix notation as earlier it will be denoted as 8 ω ω x ˆ 1 where x ˆ indicates a diagonal matrix with the elements of x on the leading diagonal to differentiate between direct and indirect effects equation 8 can be rewritten in terms of the total water consumption multiplier by simply multiplying the direct water consumption coefficient ω j by the quantity produced by each sector 9 ω x ω from equation 5 the production vector x can be expressed as open leontief model to obtain the total water consumption ω of the economy in terms of its own demand 10 ω ω ˆ i a 1 d 11 ω t ω i a 1 the expression ω i a 1 is an indicator of total water consumption ω t further it is a row vector that defines the total amount of water that the economy will both directly and indirectly consume if there are any changes in demand by one unit of any given sector we continued our analysis by further adopting velazquez s 2006 water consumption model 61 to proops model of energy use 1988 47 12 ω t ω ω a ω a 2 ω a n from the expansion of equation 11 the direct water consumption needed to sustain production by the economy can be separated from the indirect 22 68 in equation 12 where ω is the direct water requirement that is denoted by one unit of output from all sectors i the expression ω a is the water needed to let enable the production of a i and is called the first round indirect water consumption and ω a n is considered to be nth round indirect water consumption or the water required to produce the goods a n i evidently the sum of the entire round of consumption is called total indirect water consumption 64 2 2 2 the water consumption multiplier w c m as specified earlier total water consumption can be separated into direct and indirect effects to capture the indirect effect we must first consider the drag effect the leontief model accounts for the effect whereby the evolution of a given sector can drag total economic production in terms of water consumption the drag effect is measured by dividing the earlier defined indicator of total consumption ω t by the indicator of total direct consumption ω i e the water consumption multiplier w c m 61 13 w c m j i a 1 ω j t ω j the water consumption multiplier w c m defines the total quantity of water consumed by the entire economy per unit of water used directly to satisfy the demand of a given sector j in addition an indicator of indirect water consumption i w c per currency unit produced can be attained by simply subtracting unity from w c m this indicator also yields an estimate of the quantity of water used indirectly by sector j for each unit of water consumed directly to fulfill the demand of that sector 64 14 i w c j w c m j 1 ω j t ω j 1 i a 1 i 2 2 3 the matrix of intersectoral water relationships and the associated matrices from equation 11 we can specify a row vector in which each element defines the total water consumption of any given sector output changes by one unit by substituting the form of ω and subtracting direct water consumption from total water consumption a matrix for the intersectoral water relationship ω i w r may be obtained 64 15 ω i w r ω ˆ i a 1 i where states that the vector s element must be assigned alongside the diagonal of the matrix the new elements of ω i j i w r denote the additional quantity of water that would be consumed by the entire economy for each unit of additional output of the respective sector j the sum of all elements of column j expresses the indirect water requirements per unit of output of sector j this matrix is like traditional io technical coefficients in that it is able to be converted into a matrix of water transaction coefficients ψ i j ω 16 ψ i j ω ω i j i w r ω j the element ψ i j ω indicates the additional quantity of water that sector i will consume if the final demand for water by sector j increases by one unit the column sum of sector j must be equal to the indirect water consumption i w c of the respective sector therefore this new matrix reveals the intersectoral dependence between one sector and other sectors regarding water resources this is relatively important to the study in which a detailed evaluation is demonstrated 2 2 4 limitations of eeio methods the following are some salient limitations of eeio methods 33 79 the accurate assessment of environmental impact and associating these impacts with the sectors is challenging io tables are mostly not available in many nations and are published in considerably long intervals io tables may not capture all activities in the economy especially in low income nations the most critical assumption of eeio is homogeneity or the assumption that each sector in the economy produces a single homogeneous good or service all these limitations are mostly related to the accuracy and reliability of open static io models as simulation and predictive tools compared with that of other analytical tools and different methodologies an eeio analysis of the capacities and capabilities of production systems and economic structures are unique and even irreplaceable 79 2 3 indices of backward and forward linkages we have developed the water io model including recognizing the water transaction coefficients the water consumption indicators and intersectoral water relationships in earlier sections earlier studies on crucial sectors and linkages are frequently expressed entirely in monetary terms the identification of key sectors is considered useful for economic planning especially in developing nations the concept of forward and backward inter industry linkages was introduced by rasmussen to measure structural interdependence 48 75 82 85 given today s environmental problems more attention is being paid to studying economic structures in terms of resource use and water availability therefore to identify the key sectors and linkages related to environmental impact assessing the increasing water demand and ecosystem degradation is more useful the classification of environmentally significant sectors and linkages should differ from that attained in a purely economic analysis 83 84 now backward and forward linkages which play an essential role in investigating the sectors that have the greatest influence on the entire water consumption process via sales and purchases in the economy will be discussed 39 70 several studies on inter industry linkages have been performed using different methods as can be seen from in chenery et al 1958 duarte et al 2002 and velazquez 2004 12 16 60 however in this study we applied rasmussan s 1956 indicators for linkage analysis 48 backward linkage b l j r shows how much sector j affects the other sectors over purchases concerning water consumption and it can be defined as the column sum of the leontief inverse matrix i a 1 forward linkage f l i r indicates how much sector i influences others through its sales and is measured as the row sum of the leontief inverse i a 1 from a supply side viewpoint 10 17 b l j r w ˆ i 1 n a i j where b l j is the backward linkage explained as the column sum of the leontief inverse matrix i a 1 from the water io model a i j represents each of the elements in the matrix 18 f l i r w ˆ j 1 n a i j where f l i r is the forward linkage described as the row sum of the leontief inverse matrix i a 1 from the water io model a i j represents each of the elements in the matrix these linkages can be defined as indices below 19 r b l 1 n b j 1 n 2 j 1 n b j b j 1 n j 1 n b j 20 r f l 1 n f i 1 n 2 i 1 n f i f i 1 n i 1 n f i if r b l is greater than 1 a one unit change in final demand in sector j will result in an above average increase in the water consumption of all sectors in the entire economy by contrast if r f l is greater than 1 a unit change in all sectors final demand will lead to an above average increase in the water consumption of only sector i 12 generally if the backward and or forward linkage indices are greater than 1 we can say that these sectors are the key leading sectors in terms of water consumption in this paper such a method is taken one step further and applied to the environmentally extended io model of the balinese economy which comprises 25 sectors the forward and backward linkages are analyzed to demonstrate the direct and indirect effects of investing in particular sectors of the balinese economy this study provides new insights to its subsequent application of the derived forward and backward linkage coefficients to identify the most dominant sectors this enables the balinese economy to stimulate economic development yet simultaneously produce minimal environmental effects across the provincial economy moreover it is extremely beneficial for analyzing the economy wide environmental impact of government investment programs during times of crisis 75 3 data sources the dataset in this paper primarily comprises two types a regional io table that facilitates investigating the flows of goods and services among producers and consumers and the interrelationships between all economic sectors the water data contain direct water consumption and the water consumption coefficients i e both direct and indirect the quantity of freshwater consumption to produce a unit of output of sales or purchases in all economic sectors 3 1 regional io economic data recent research has paid more attention to analyzing the regional economic impact and intersectoral relationships within a region 37 54 68 in our analysis the regional io tables in monetary value units for bali province are for the year 2007 from the badan pusat statistik provinsi bali statistics of bali province 10 the io table classification is based on 54 sectors however mining and basic metal industry and other metal goods sectors were excluded because of a lack of data the io table structure includes the flow of intermediate consumption of production sectors final consumption and exports and the use of imports to make the comprehensive dataset reliable a few changes to the io table were needed due to restrictions in water consumption data as a result we combined 25 of the 52 sectors into aggregated sectors and developed a 2007 table for bali that represents a 25 sector by 25 sector io table whose grouping of economic sectors is constant with our division of 25 water use classifications see appendix 2 3 2 water data sector wise water consumption data are not available for the province of bali indonesia the water data in this paper were taken from the water consumption inventory database 44 which covers all goods and services in asia predominantly the water consumption associated with the economic sectors in nine asian countries including indonesia uses the asian international io table aiio this water data include rainwater surface water and groundwater but not greywater we estimated the direct water consumption for each sector using the direct water consumption data from indonesia except for a few sectors related to services to obtain data for these sectors we determined direct water consumption by sector by referencing the volume of freshwater drawn from sources of water by a given sector 27 4 results and discussion water consumption in the province of bali indonesia has recently received much attention due to developing water scarcity in the region and conflicts between the tourism and agriculture sectors to understand the situation with water resources and analyze bali s water consumption patterns we need to learn which sectors consume more water than others and which key sectors have a greater influence on the entire water consumption process in this section we present and discuss the results obtained from the analysis 4 1 features of water consumption indicators table 3 presents data on direct water consumption and demonstrates that the amount of water directly consumed by the primary sector the agriculture sector including other food crops non food crops and the rice sector is much higher than that consumed by the processing sectors and service sectors the agriculture sector s water consumption was above 4 billion m3 and the rest of the sectors only consumed a small portion of this amount about 456 million m3 these results confirm the fact that agriculture is the main consumer of water resources in bali accounting for 89 of the total water consumption in the province the top five dominant sectors in terms of direct water use in bali province are food crops 53 3 followed by non food crops 17 8 paddies 15 7 hotels and restaurants 5 5 and other grains 2 9 the water consumption intensity of the agricultural sectors is significantly higher than that of the other sectors specifically the water consumption per unit of output was highest for forestry and its products at 7 669 m3 per million indonesian rupiah idr interestingly the overall agriculture sector consumed more than 89 of all water resources however except for forestry and its product sectors paddy maize and other food crops sectors and the non food crops sector the direct water consumption per unit produced was less than 800 m3 per million rupiah thus agriculture related sectors have a pivotal impact on the use of water resources in the case of manufacturing and services sectors the water consumption per unit of output is quite small however sectors like food beverage tobacco coffee industries paper industry paper and cardboard goods and hotels and restaurants exhibit a high level of direct water consumption and relatively high consumption per unit of output data from the padas stone and other minerals sector the timber industry and wood products the car body industry and transportation equipment other processing industries construction the crafts and minerals industry the other building materials non metal mineral goods industry and the paper industry and paper and cardboard goods sector demonstrate low direct water consumption per unit produced sometimes these sectors are overlooked by water policymakers because of their low direct water consumption 61 however these sectors consume a great amount of water resources indirectly see table 4 furthermore the data can demonstrate the composition of their direct and indirect water consumption the direct water consumption observed for the agriculture sectors are rice 83 maize 85 other food crops 90 plantation non food crops 67 and livestock 76 this indicates that the water used in their production processes is drawn from the available surface water e g river and springs and underground water resources as stated above the industrial and service sectors consume a large amount of water indirectly in this view the indirect water consumption appears to comprise a pivotal share of the water consumption in bali province appendix fig 1 if compared with the agriculture sector the amount of water consumed by the manufacturing and service sectors is quite small however the indirect water consumption of the manufacturing and service sectors is significantly higher sectors such as padas stone and other minerals 8 textile apparel and leather goods industries 10 timber industry and wood products 11 paper industry paper and cardboard goods 12 crafts and minerals industry 14 car body industry and transportation equipment 16 other processing industries 18 construction 20 transport and other transport services 23 communications post and giro 24 among others consume a small quantity of water directly but their total consumption of water is somewhat high therefore it can be presumed that these sectors consume a great amount of water indirectly as shown in table 4 this indicates that they only use a small amount of water directly in production but to produce the inputs made by the other sectors combined in their production processes a high level of water consumption is required these sectors also have a large drag effect on the water consumption of the entire bali economy this can be observed by examining the water consumption multiplier wcm and the indicator of indirect consumption see table 4 if we only consider direct water consumption sectors like livestock 5 food beverage tobacco and coffee industries 9 timber industry and wood products 11 fuels and chemical industry rubber and plastics 13 crafts and minerals industry 14 car body industry and transportation equipment 16 and other processing industries 18 would be overlooked because their direct consumption is insignificant however the indirect consumption of these sectors is predominantly high a point that can be ignored due to the high level of direct consumption of the other sectors for each cubic meter 1 m3 of water consumed directly in the livestock sector 5 an increase in production requires the consumption of an additional 38 35 m3 of water by other production sectors likewise in the food beverage tobacco coffee industries 9 each 1 m3 consumed directly requires the indirect consumption of an additional 27 58 m3 of water by the other sectors for the timber industry and wood products sector 11 for each 1 m3 of water consumed directly 22 90 m3 is consumed indirectly the level of indirect water consumption was also high for the fuels and chemical industry rubber plastics 13 the crafts and minerals industry 14 the car body industry and transportation equipment 16 other processing industries 18 and service sectors such as construction 20 and hotels and restaurants 22 which advances 3 77 m3 for each 1 m3 consumed directly these results clearly indicate that the sectors with the highest indirect water consumption are those that are normally considered to be the driving forces behind bali s economy due to the strong influence that demand for their respective products exerts on the production of the remaining sectors in other words an increase in production in these sectors requires additional inputs from the other sectors locally provincially and nationally 4 2 intersectoral water relationships table 5 exhibits the intersectoral water transaction coefficients we first notice that the maximum water transaction coefficients are relatively low and that displays most water transactions among several sectors can be unseen because these transactions are limited to a few sectors in this developed new matrix it is obvious that indirect water consumption is derived from non food crops plantation 4 as shown in table 5 the matrix discloses that for each 1 m3 of water consumed directly by the other processing industries 18 fuels chemical industry rubber plastics 13 car body industry and transportation equipment 16 and livestock 5 sustaining this water demand requires an additional 75 9 m3 61 8 m3 15 1 m3 and 14 2 m3 of water respectively to be consumed by non food crops plantation similarly for each 1 m3 of water consumed directly by the other processing industries 18 food beverage tobacco coffee industries 9 and livestock 5 requires an additional 7 1 18 0 and 14 5 m3 of water respectively to be consumed by paddy 1 on the other hand it is shown that the sectors that stand out for their purchases are food beverage tobacco and coffee industries 9 whose demand is fulfilled with products generated by rice 1 maize 2 other food crops 3 and plantation non food crops 4 with a high water content other processing industries 18 are supplied mainly by plantation non food crops 4 rice 1 other food crops 3 and forestry products 6 construction 20 is also supplied predominantly by plantation non food crops 4 and forestry products 6 the hotel and restaurants sector 22 are supplied with rice 1 maize 2 other food crops 3 and plantation non food crops 4 apart from these four sectors other significant sales are those made by the crafts and minerals industry 14 to forestry and its products 6 and trading 21 lastly we must observe that the highest ratio of sales in all sectors are transacted within the sectors that specify a high rate of self consumption with concern to water table 6 presents the matrix of intersectoral water relationships it can be read either by rows or by columns the rows of the matrix can be interpreted as the sales of water that sector i makes to the rest of sector j the column sums to the total amount of water sold by sector i the columns of matrix j lists the purchases that sector j makes from the rest of the sectors j so the row sums of this matrix provide us with an indication of the total water requirements of sector j 4 3 inter industrial linkages the inter industrial linkages analysis can determine which key sectors have a greater impact on the entire water consumption process through both purchases and or sales 16 table 7 classifies the key sectors with respect to the water consumption in the bali province regarding the backward linkages index the other food crops sector 3 shows the largest water backward linkages indices backward linkage represents that a unit increase in all sector s final demand will generate an above average increase in water consumption of other food crops likewise sectors like hotels restaurants 22 food beverage tobacco coffee industries 9 plantation non food crops 4 and fuels chemical industry rubber plastics 13 have vital influence on total water consumption under the forward linkages indices other food crops 3 plantation non food crops 4 rice crop 1 and hotels restaurants 22 are the key water consumption influencing sectors this signifies that a unit change in their final demand will cause an above average increase in water consumption in all sectors remarkably the hotels and restaurants sector 22 reveals that it has higher influence on water consumption both in its backward and forward linkages indices some sectors like livestock 5 forestry and its products 6 fishery 7 paper industry paper and cardboard goods 12 transport and other transport services 23 and financial public community cultural entertainment and other services 25 and a few other sectors in manufacturing and service sectors have backward and forward linkage indices that are less than 1 which indicates less influence on water consumption 5 limitations the total number of sectors in this paper is 54 but there are no data for the mining and basic metal industry and other metal goods sectors by excluding these two sectors we aggregated 52 sectors into 25 sectors that were aggregated based on provincial industrial classifications 7 this could create a bias because there is a larger number of different products included in one sectoral classification 39 with the non availability of direct water consumption data for some sectors particularly service sectors such as the financial public community cultural and entertainment and other services communications post and giro and transport and other transport services we have collected direct water coefficients based on the reports and documents provided by udayana university indonesia and the water statistics reports obtained from the bali statistical bureau and japan international cooperation agency jica the results are subject to considerable uncertainty and underlying variability for instance the indonesia water use data for 2005 and the economic io table for 2007 are estimated moreover the total indonesian water use has considerable uncertainty because it is based on agency estimates various agencies such as badan pusat statistik provinsi bps fao united states department of agriculture and united states geological survey use different methods to estimate water use 80 finally the regional io table used in our analysis was for the year 2007 with the latest data available was created by the bali statistical bureau however today s current economic structure is somewhat like 2007 because the tourism and agricultural sectors are still dominant sectors in this region these limitations could be mitigated by a method that performs estimates for several years to show time based developments several studies feature the same limitation unavailable water use data for each sector however to overcome this constraint boudhar adopted a measure of sectoral water use that measures the volume of freshwater drawn from the water source by a given industry including water use for industrial sectors in m3 data which were taken from the fao aquastat 6 27 64 the proportion of each sector s contribution can be derived from the vector of sectoral water use in monetary units for a selected country the available data on the economic use of water are not structured according to the same group level in this case most studies have categorized a large number of disaggregated sectors into limited or aggregated sectors that can benefit from sourcing water consumption information from available data sources which includes agricultural and related national and international organizations meteorological departments groundwater monitoring agencies industrial reports and private and government owned industries 5 79 6 policy implications the production of key industrial sectors such as rice maize other food crops plantation and livestock not only increases water consumption in other sectors but also significantly increases water demand in crucial industrial sectors and the value added by other sectors the bali provincial government and the indonesian government must focus on key industrial sectors when designing water saving policies and enhancing water use efficiency in lowland rice through water saving technology such as system of rice intensification cultivation and drip irrigation water saving varieties such as the ciherang variety and timely repair irrigation channels to minimize water leakages the other dominant service sector tourism hotels and restaurants would increase the value added by the national economic system and have a higher impact on water consumption if the water consumed by these sectors is restricted it may affect economic growth an increase in the value added of these key sectors will lead to an increase in water resources used in the whole economy moreover when designing policies the water policymakers should also consider indirect water use the manufacturing i e food beverage tobacco and coffee industry timber industry and wood products fuel and chemical industry rubber plastics crafts and minerals industry car body industry and transportation equipment and other processing industries and service sectors construction have a high level of indirect water use and less direct use a unit change in the production of a sector with high indirect water use will unavoidably be redirected to the water use of the other sectors and may lead to destructive outcomes on the water resources in bali province therefore policymakers must consider both direct and indirect consumption when formulating policies the sustainable utilization of water resources is a challenging task in many countries particularly rapid economic growth urbanization and increasing population create a high competition among key sectors in bali to maintain stability among key sectors we came up with the following plans and actions that may help to tackle the challenges 1 with regard to agriculture water use developing water saving agriculture controlling erosion and landslide management systems preventing flood and reducing leakages in the drainage system and adopting water saving technologies such as drip irrigation systems in provinces with raw water 2 with regard to tourism e g hotels and restaurants and other manufacturing industries quota water supply paid water supply and double charging can be implemented for industries that overuse groundwater sources drawing more groundwater affects the resource available to future generations therefore it is essential to consider allocating it over generations 81 3 in provinces where water resources are scarce springs should be used as a source of irrigation water cross regional integrated water supply systems should be developed low water consuming industries should be encouraged and a water recycling system should be developed 4 the dominant key sectors tourism agriculture and manufacturing industries that follow sustainable water use practices must be rewarded to serve as incentives and there should be timely support from the government to water management organizations 5 the government or water management organizations must arrange yearly meetings to invite representatives from all the industrial sectors situated in the province or region to discuss the differences in the demand and supply of water in the province and share the innovative ideas of those who have already adopted water use saving technologies for the benefit of others therefore interest groups should be formed to impact the allocation process so that the end results best serve the interest of the society and environment likewise reform efforts in water allocation which result in a redistribution of economic benefits should be implemented 81 7 conclusions in this paper the proposed approach used specified water indicators and matrices to differentiate between direct and indirect water consumption we also applied backward and forward linkage analysis to exhibit the key water intensive sectors that influence the process of total water consumption the results indicate that direct water consumption for agriculture sectors i e rice 1 followed by maize 2 other food crops 3 plantation non food crops 4 and livestock 5 was the highest however the manufacturing and service sectors consume a large amount of water indirectly in this view the amount of water consumed by the manufacturing and service sectors is quite small nevertheless indirect water consumption appears to comprise a pivotal share of total water resources for instance sectors like livestock 5 food beverage tobacco coffee industries 9 timber industry and wood products 11 fuels and chemical industry rubber and plastics 13 crafts and minerals industry 14 car body industry and transportation equipment 16 and other processing industries 18 have a high level of indirect water consumption according to the backward and forward linkages other food crops 3 rice crop 1 hotels and restaurants 22 food beverage tobacco and coffee industries 9 plantation non food crops 4 and fuels and chemical industry rubber and plastics 13 are the key influencing sectors on processing total water consumption as expected hotels and restaurants 22 are a high influencing sector both in backward and forward linkage analysis we must admit the well known fact that the greatest demand for water from the agricultural sectors the hotels and restaurants and other sectors might specifically take place during the dry season particularly from april to september moreover this might sometimes cause problems in the production process due to a lack of the main inputs needed by the sector which has consequences for the economy 61 on this basis total water consumption that is indirect consumption together with direct consumption should be taken into proper consideration when planning the production economy of a province or country the indonesia climate change sectoral roadmap synthesis report 2009 indicated that the java bali region has already faced a deficit in its water balance and competition between economic sectors in using water resources is quite high 29 in addition distributing water resources between the various economic and non economic users such private household irrigation farming communities private commercial water companies state based water distribution manufacturing industries and tourism and other business activities can be a complicated and difficult task 55 therefore our developed water matrices and indices will provide a useful tool for water and economic planning policymakers in devising sustainable water saving solutions the same methodology can account for not only productive factors but also for environmental variables moreover this study will have significant practical implications for other regions that have similar situations of water resources or competition among industries finally we are aware that this paper is basically a partial primary approach to assessing the capacity of economic activities on balinese water resources and that it could be more complete by also performing a comprehensive analysis of water consumption and economic variables such as value added and the employment generated by each sector by doing so we might obtain a comprehensible representation of the economic and environmental prominence of the water used by the different productive sectors in addition our work might also be improved by using a current io table and observing variations in the variables such as virtual water and interregional or interprovincial trade and other inclusions overtime these are some of the potential future research areas of this

8785,this paper provides an extended input output io model of sectoral water consumption for bali a province located in indonesia that is a well known global tourist destination currently the province is experiencing water shortages which leads to a burden and heavy competition in water usage among the various economic sectors we developed a method for determining which industrial economic sectors directly and indirectly consume the most substantial quantities of water and to what extent available water resources can become a restrictive factor in the development of leading economic sectors we also used another method backward and forward linkage indices to identify the key sectors influencing water consumption the results confirm that the agriculture sectors including other food crops non food crops and rice consume the highest portion of total water consumption however indirect water consumption appears to comprise a vital share of total water resources these sectors including the livestock industry food beverage tobacco and coffee industries the timber industry wood products crafts and minerals industry trading construction and other processing industries have the highest indirect consumption our model for direct and indirect water consumption is a useful tool for water and economic planning policymakers for devising water saving policies and expanding the provincial

roadmap idr indonesian rupiah 1 introduction water plays a critical role in society and is a vital driving force behind economic growth along with other regions of the world the asia pacific region is confronting major freshwater water resource glitches due to the increasing population rapid urbanization and economic development 21 67 the region faces inconsistency of demand to enhance agriculture industrial and energy production with a diminishing per capita water availability 2 indonesia is among the asian nations that are significantly affected by droughts and floods in various administrative provinces currently the country is facing intensifying freshwater supply issues predominantly on java and sumatra islands where the demand for freshwater is the highest the problems related to freshwater shortages are population growth industrialization overuse urbanization and the insufficient supply of water in some provinces e g bali and regions 59 the island of bali a well known tourist destination is one of 34 indonesian provinces covering a geographical area of 5 636 kilometers km2 according to bali province statistics the economy has become reliant on the tourism sector which is renowned for its overuse of water resources while agriculture is still the primary user of water the water use of domestic households and the tourism industry as well as other industrial water users is currently increasing the balinese water supply is restricted because of massive stretches of coastland with sensitive and restricted groundwater potential compared to the small size of the island and its dense population 4 19 the water supply is considered critical to the high population density and tourism infrastructure and a 70 upsurge in water consumption is projected in all regencies including south bali of denpasar badung and others see fig 1 by 2025 3 31 57 under these challenges water is progressively becoming a priority policy issue on an international national and regional level in 2012 the fourth edition of the world water report 67 recognized the importance of robust governance mechanisms are necessary to protect water resource and ensure sustainable development and equitable distribution of water derived benefits p 2 evaluating the demand of the various sectors requires a comprehensive understanding of the issues this paper will address some of these issues focusing on the interrelationship between the consumption of water and the production structure in bali this paper is organized as follows the first section provides a brief introduction states the importance of the economic situation and water resource in bali province and water consumption of multiple sectors and reviews the literature on water extended io model followed by the objectives sections 2 and 3 present the methodological framework including the water io framework water consumption multipliers and backward and forward linkages followed by a description of the regional economic and water data section 4 presents the results and discussion section 5 presents the limitations of the study finally the policy implications and future directions are presented in the last section 1 1 importance of the economic situation and water resources in bali the province of bali has been historically dominated by the agricultural sector which is a major economic driver for the province in 1969 the agrarian sector contributed 61 21 of bali s gross regional domestic product grdp 7 8 10 18 66 fig 2 illustrates that as of 2018 the contribution of the primary sector agriculture to the grdp decreased to 13 78 a major recent development in the balinese economy has been the expansion of the trade and service sectors the tourism sector accommodation food service activities has increased from contributing 9 59 in 1969 to 18 20 in 2005 and 23 33 in 2018 swiftly taking over the balinese economy 66 predominantly these distributions clearly demonstrate that the tourism sector has become a driving force in bali s economic development and a significant economic boost for bali province the transportation industry crucial for scaling up tourism accounted for 7 39 in 2010 and 9 74 in 2018 followed by the construction industry which reports increasing from 4 03 in 2005 to 9 39 in 2018 the trade restaurants and hotels sector makes a significant contribution not only to the economy but also to employment representing 31 69 760 093 jobs in 2017 7 bps 2018 the dominant tourism associated industries have been recognized as placing a considerable burden on water supplies and competing with local users as well as surpassing agriculture in terms of its contribution to the grdp 4 23 32 46 this creates an imbalance between sectors due to the higher water consumption of the tourism sector which reportedly consumes 65 of all local water resources 13 1 1 1 freshwater resources by regency in bali water is important to the development of economic activity and vital for sustaining life and livelihoods as well as having religious and cultural significance the province of bali s annual rainfall differs because of climatological changes and is less than 1 500 mm in the coastal zone and 3 000 mm in the mountainous areas 53 siska 2018 the main freshwater resources for the bali province are groundwater 40 0 followed by springs 28 7 rivers 25 0 and others 5 3 the regencies of denpasar and badung have 44 5 of all freshwater resources while buleleng tabanan gianyar and klungkung regencies have 40 3 the remaining regencies of jembrana bangli and karangasem comprises 15 2 of all freshwater resources see table 1 as we can see the sources of freshwater resources are unevenly distributed across the province of bali according to the ministry of public works 2015 several rivers in the province of bali are perennial rivers that account for 41 0 some do not flow during the dry season and only 21 0 of rivers flow during the wet season cited in siska 2018 53 40 however the regencies of denpasar gianyar and jembrana followed by buleleng and badung consume more groundwater resources which may be the reason for maintaining the water demand for the tourism sector for daily activities including swimming pools and gardens according to the food and agriculture organisation fao 2003 bali s water supply is compromised because of massive areas of coastland with sensitive and limited groundwater potential relative to the small size of the bali island and its dense population cited in ref 55 strauβ 2011 19 in addition a limited water supply occurred during the months of july and october due to because of shortage of rainfall that creates water stress and intensify the water demand between the local communities and economic sectors in this way the water allocation problems caused by the high rate of population density and as well as the competition among dominant economic sectors of agriculture tourism and other sectors would lead to severe problems with the water supply 4 55 therefore it is indispensable to seek new options for managing the available water resources in a sustainable manner 1 1 2 water use for different sectors the composition of water use in bali has increased 1 1 0 02 billion cubic meters m3 as a whole however the distribution of water use between agriculture domestic users and the tourism industry changed from 92 7 and 1 respectively in 1994 to 88 10 and 2 respectively in 2013 water use for agriculture exhibited a fluctuating trend between 1994 and 2014 decreasing from 1994 2003 and then increasing between 2003 2014 due to growth in rice production 53 the perusahaan daerah air minum pdam is a local government owned water utility whose responsibility it is to provide clean water supply to various sectors except the agricultural sector appendix 1 the rising population density caused an increase in water consumption by households i e the domestic sector from 67 7 in 2009 to 75 0 in 2015 followed by trade companies from 8 0 in 2009 to 11 2 in 2019 which includes multiple services such as star and non hotels restaurants and showrooms etc the water use by the manufacturing sector includes food and beverage and textile chemical and as shown in fig 3 other industries declined from 5 7 in 2009 to 4 7 in 2015 earlier studies e g cole 2012 suriyani 2015 trisnawati 2012 have reported that tourism consumes 65 of all local water resources which creates conflict between the hotel industry and local communities 13 56 58 according to tourism concern 2012 the changes in water supply distribution in favor of tourism raise questions regarding water quality and equity between the various economic sectors trade companies and domestic users 42 sometimes conflicts arise between farmers and pdam and local communities over clean water siska et al 2018 argued that there is a misunderstanding between water users on the level of water availability and allocation among sectors predominantly as a result of the recent rapid development in tourism 53 therefore by addressing these issues and the water challenges between the different sectors in the province of bali this study will determine precisely which sectors consume more water both directly and indirectly by using an extended io framework so that the findings can provide better solutions for the management of water resources 1 2 review of literature the leontief io model is a valuable tool for structural analysis and is widely used in the global academic community several studies have used this tool to analyze economic structures and their physical impact on the environment such as energy consumption environmental pollution and water pollution the application of the io model to environmental interactions the cost of economic industries and final demand categories were first introduced in 1966 by cumberland cited in ref 62 70 later in 1970 leontief extended the io model to analyze environmental issues by adding new rows or corresponding columns to accommodate new production inputs or outputs 36 proops 1977 used the extended io model to set up a range of indicators of both direct and indirect energy use 47 several researchers have used an extended io model to study energy consumption and atmospheric pollutant related issues 1 15 20 33 41 51 52 71 from an economic perspective the application of io analysis to water resources has received limited attention studies that use the io framework are even fewer in earlier studies harris and rea 1984 cited in ref 43 conducted a water allocation study in the united states us 25 and in 1992 sanchez choliz et al cited in ref 61 applied the io methodology to spain 50 only a few studies have assessed the effects of economic production structures and domestic demand on natural water resources especially in water threatened regions and countries 6 11 16 24 28 34 35 63 65 68 69 using an environmental water extended io eeio framework hristov 2016 concluded that because of the seasonal and spatial distribution of water resources in the western balkan region the sustainable management of water resources is crucial in macedonia 77 the eeio analysis supports data on environmental economic and water policies by quantifying how the demand for goods and services leads to resource use in the economy 74 76 moreover the eeio framework provides a high resolution of sectors and structural economic composition which makes it a useful tool for supply chain impact assessment 78 recently several io studies have been conducted about water resources in china 11 14 24 28 38 for instance wang et al 2009 developed a method to identify the relationship between production activities and the related water consumption in zhangya city an arid area of northwestern china which is categorized as a water shortage area 64 however the situation in china is not the same as that in other developing asian nations ono et al 2017 developed a water consumption inventory database that focused on investigating asian water use with an io framework 44 the data inventory is quite useful for countries like indonesia for assessing the relationship between economic activity and water consumption bogra et al 2016 described a water withdrawal io model by combining data about direct water withdrawal attained from various sources using a 2003 2004 economic io table 5 furthermore they estimated the direct and indirect water withdrawal of all industrial sectors in india pavisorn et al 2018 used an io model to assess the relationship between water use and thailand s economic structure 45 čegar 2020 constructed a water extended io model and empirically applied it to his study using the indicators of direct indirect and quantified cumulative water intensity of production sectors including indirect water use multipliers in the croatian economy 79 with regard to indonesia most studies using an io framework focus on structural changes in economic industries and trade 26 72 73 for example dwiatmoko et al 2019 used io analysis to investigate the effect of railway development on the indonesian national economy 17 moreover james and fujita 2000 used io tables to estimate the employment effects of manufactured exports in two sub periods 30 budy resosudarmo 2003 used io analysis to conduct research to identify policies to solve river water pollution in indonesia 49 with this background we found that no study used io tables to examine the province of bali or other indonesian provinces moreover the current water resources situation in bali province 53 55 particularly the higher water use competition among industrial sectors e g the agriculture and tourism sectors leads to conflicts among stakeholders therefore to fill the gaps mentioned above this study develops a water io table for bali province to explore the interrelationship between the economic sectors that consume the highest amount of water both directly and indirectly this study is the first attempt to use the water extended io method to quantify how demand for goods and services in these sectors leads to water use in the bali provincial economy it is also the first study about indonesia and other developing nations in asia except china in addition this study has significant practical implications for asian countries and others that have similar water competition situations the foremost objective of this study is to examine the relationship between the various economic sectors and their physical relationship with water consumption the appropriate method for analyzing the direct and indirect as well as the intersectoral water relationships in an economy is the extended leontief io model 39 while extending the model for water use 61 second this study also attempts to determine the sectors that consume the highest amount of water both directly and indirectly to explore the key sectors that have the most significant effect on the entire water consumption process in terms of both purchases and sales in the economy this study employs backward and forward linkages 70 the conclusions of this study will elucidate better solutions to facilitate the design of sustainable water use policies at the provincial level and address the intensifying competition for water among various economic sectors 2 methodology to achieve the sustainable use of water resources the construction of an io table is indubitably important for examining the relationship between economic sectors and water consumption in this paper we adopt a traditional leontief io model and extend it in terms of water consumption 2 1 conventional io production model the fundamental leontief io model is normally constructed from observed economic data for a country region or province and a specific time period io analysis is concerned with according to miller and blair 2009 the activity of a group of industrial sectors that both produce of goods outputs and consume goods from other industrial sectors inputs in the process of producing each industry s own output 39 p 2 in table 2 the extra column categorized as final demand comprises of household and government consumption capital investments and net exports of goods and services which represents the sales by each sector to final markets to use for production the additional row labeled value added accounts for other non industrial inputs to production such as labor depreciation of capital indirect business taxes and imports 39 the io model consists of a set of linear equations the basic equation in the leontief model determines that the production of an economy depends on intersectoral relations and final demand 1 x i j 1 n x i j d i where x i j represents the values of the transactions from each sector i to sector j and d i denotes the final demand for goods for each sector this equation can be rewritten to incorporate the technical coefficients of production a i j which are described as the purchases that sector j makes from sector i per total effective production unit of sector j which represents the direct input required by sector j 2 a i j x i j x j 3 x i j 1 n a i j x j d i in matrix notation for the entire economy it becomes 4 x a x d to solve for x we obtain the total production delivered to final demand 5 x i a 1 d where i a 1 is known as the leontief inverse matrix or the total requirement matrix representing the total production that every sector must generate to satisfy the final demand of the economy for further expression of equation 5 the production of sector i can be specified as follows 6 x i j 1 n β i j d i where β i j are the elements in the leontief inverse matrix i a 1 describes the increase in production generated by sector i if the demand of sector j increases by one unit the column sums of this matrix express the total direct and indirect requirements of a sector to meet its final demand the diagonal elements in the matrix are the direct effect and the column sum of the off diagonal elements equals the indirect effect 2 2 water input output model 2 2 1 the extended io model of water consumption as we elucidated in an earlier section the extension of the conventional method is done in terms of water consumption it is completed by adding an additional row ω in which physical data on each sector s water use is considered as a production factor this model defines total water consumption and differentiates between direct and indirect water consumption these concepts can be presented in the model which allows us to formulate a matrix of intersectoral water relationships and analyze the relative importance of direct and indirect water consumption 61 hereafter production vector x j data are expressed in monetary units the indicator of total direct consumption per unit produced ω j can be defined by dividing the water consumed directly by each sector ω j with total input to that sector x j this expression as a column vector is defined as follows 7 ω j ω j x j in matrix notation as earlier it will be denoted as 8 ω ω x ˆ 1 where x ˆ indicates a diagonal matrix with the elements of x on the leading diagonal to differentiate between direct and indirect effects equation 8 can be rewritten in terms of the total water consumption multiplier by simply multiplying the direct water consumption coefficient ω j by the quantity produced by each sector 9 ω x ω from equation 5 the production vector x can be expressed as open leontief model to obtain the total water consumption ω of the economy in terms of its own demand 10 ω ω ˆ i a 1 d 11 ω t ω i a 1 the expression ω i a 1 is an indicator of total water consumption ω t further it is a row vector that defines the total amount of water that the economy will both directly and indirectly consume if there are any changes in demand by one unit of any given sector we continued our analysis by further adopting velazquez s 2006 water consumption model 61 to proops model of energy use 1988 47 12 ω t ω ω a ω a 2 ω a n from the expansion of equation 11 the direct water consumption needed to sustain production by the economy can be separated from the indirect 22 68 in equation 12 where ω is the direct water requirement that is denoted by one unit of output from all sectors i the expression ω a is the water needed to let enable the production of a i and is called the first round indirect water consumption and ω a n is considered to be nth round indirect water consumption or the water required to produce the goods a n i evidently the sum of the entire round of consumption is called total indirect water consumption 64 2 2 2 the water consumption multiplier w c m as specified earlier total water consumption can be separated into direct and indirect effects to capture the indirect effect we must first consider the drag effect the leontief model accounts for the effect whereby the evolution of a given sector can drag total economic production in terms of water consumption the drag effect is measured by dividing the earlier defined indicator of total consumption ω t by the indicator of total direct consumption ω i e the water consumption multiplier w c m 61 13 w c m j i a 1 ω j t ω j the water consumption multiplier w c m defines the total quantity of water consumed by the entire economy per unit of water used directly to satisfy the demand of a given sector j in addition an indicator of indirect water consumption i w c per currency unit produced can be attained by simply subtracting unity from w c m this indicator also yields an estimate of the quantity of water used indirectly by sector j for each unit of water consumed directly to fulfill the demand of that sector 64 14 i w c j w c m j 1 ω j t ω j 1 i a 1 i 2 2 3 the matrix of intersectoral water relationships and the associated matrices from equation 11 we can specify a row vector in which each element defines the total water consumption of any given sector output changes by one unit by substituting the form of ω and subtracting direct water consumption from total water consumption a matrix for the intersectoral water relationship ω i w r may be obtained 64 15 ω i w r ω ˆ i a 1 i where states that the vector s element must be assigned alongside the diagonal of the matrix the new elements of ω i j i w r denote the additional quantity of water that would be consumed by the entire economy for each unit of additional output of the respective sector j the sum of all elements of column j expresses the indirect water requirements per unit of output of sector j this matrix is like traditional io technical coefficients in that it is able to be converted into a matrix of water transaction coefficients ψ i j ω 16 ψ i j ω ω i j i w r ω j the element ψ i j ω indicates the additional quantity of water that sector i will consume if the final demand for water by sector j increases by one unit the column sum of sector j must be equal to the indirect water consumption i w c of the respective sector therefore this new matrix reveals the intersectoral dependence between one sector and other sectors regarding water resources this is relatively important to the study in which a detailed evaluation is demonstrated 2 2 4 limitations of eeio methods the following are some salient limitations of eeio methods 33 79 the accurate assessment of environmental impact and associating these impacts with the sectors is challenging io tables are mostly not available in many nations and are published in considerably long intervals io tables may not capture all activities in the economy especially in low income nations the most critical assumption of eeio is homogeneity or the assumption that each sector in the economy produces a single homogeneous good or service all these limitations are mostly related to the accuracy and reliability of open static io models as simulation and predictive tools compared with that of other analytical tools and different methodologies an eeio analysis of the capacities and capabilities of production systems and economic structures are unique and even irreplaceable 79 2 3 indices of backward and forward linkages we have developed the water io model including recognizing the water transaction coefficients the water consumption indicators and intersectoral water relationships in earlier sections earlier studies on crucial sectors and linkages are frequently expressed entirely in monetary terms the identification of key sectors is considered useful for economic planning especially in developing nations the concept of forward and backward inter industry linkages was introduced by rasmussen to measure structural interdependence 48 75 82 85 given today s environmental problems more attention is being paid to studying economic structures in terms of resource use and water availability therefore to identify the key sectors and linkages related to environmental impact assessing the increasing water demand and ecosystem degradation is more useful the classification of environmentally significant sectors and linkages should differ from that attained in a purely economic analysis 83 84 now backward and forward linkages which play an essential role in investigating the sectors that have the greatest influence on the entire water consumption process via sales and purchases in the economy will be discussed 39 70 several studies on inter industry linkages have been performed using different methods as can be seen from in chenery et al 1958 duarte et al 2002 and velazquez 2004 12 16 60 however in this study we applied rasmussan s 1956 indicators for linkage analysis 48 backward linkage b l j r shows how much sector j affects the other sectors over purchases concerning water consumption and it can be defined as the column sum of the leontief inverse matrix i a 1 forward linkage f l i r indicates how much sector i influences others through its sales and is measured as the row sum of the leontief inverse i a 1 from a supply side viewpoint 10 17 b l j r w ˆ i 1 n a i j where b l j is the backward linkage explained as the column sum of the leontief inverse matrix i a 1 from the water io model a i j represents each of the elements in the matrix 18 f l i r w ˆ j 1 n a i j where f l i r is the forward linkage described as the row sum of the leontief inverse matrix i a 1 from the water io model a i j represents each of the elements in the matrix these linkages can be defined as indices below 19 r b l 1 n b j 1 n 2 j 1 n b j b j 1 n j 1 n b j 20 r f l 1 n f i 1 n 2 i 1 n f i f i 1 n i 1 n f i if r b l is greater than 1 a one unit change in final demand in sector j will result in an above average increase in the water consumption of all sectors in the entire economy by contrast if r f l is greater than 1 a unit change in all sectors final demand will lead to an above average increase in the water consumption of only sector i 12 generally if the backward and or forward linkage indices are greater than 1 we can say that these sectors are the key leading sectors in terms of water consumption in this paper such a method is taken one step further and applied to the environmentally extended io model of the balinese economy which comprises 25 sectors the forward and backward linkages are analyzed to demonstrate the direct and indirect effects of investing in particular sectors of the balinese economy this study provides new insights to its subsequent application of the derived forward and backward linkage coefficients to identify the most dominant sectors this enables the balinese economy to stimulate economic development yet simultaneously produce minimal environmental effects across the provincial economy moreover it is extremely beneficial for analyzing the economy wide environmental impact of government investment programs during times of crisis 75 3 data sources the dataset in this paper primarily comprises two types a regional io table that facilitates investigating the flows of goods and services among producers and consumers and the interrelationships between all economic sectors the water data contain direct water consumption and the water consumption coefficients i e both direct and indirect the quantity of freshwater consumption to produce a unit of output of sales or purchases in all economic sectors 3 1 regional io economic data recent research has paid more attention to analyzing the regional economic impact and intersectoral relationships within a region 37 54 68 in our analysis the regional io tables in monetary value units for bali province are for the year 2007 from the badan pusat statistik provinsi bali statistics of bali province 10 the io table classification is based on 54 sectors however mining and basic metal industry and other metal goods sectors were excluded because of a lack of data the io table structure includes the flow of intermediate consumption of production sectors final consumption and exports and the use of imports to make the comprehensive dataset reliable a few changes to the io table were needed due to restrictions in water consumption data as a result we combined 25 of the 52 sectors into aggregated sectors and developed a 2007 table for bali that represents a 25 sector by 25 sector io table whose grouping of economic sectors is constant with our division of 25 water use classifications see appendix 2 3 2 water data sector wise water consumption data are not available for the province of bali indonesia the water data in this paper were taken from the water consumption inventory database 44 which covers all goods and services in asia predominantly the water consumption associated with the economic sectors in nine asian countries including indonesia uses the asian international io table aiio this water data include rainwater surface water and groundwater but not greywater we estimated the direct water consumption for each sector using the direct water consumption data from indonesia except for a few sectors related to services to obtain data for these sectors we determined direct water consumption by sector by referencing the volume of freshwater drawn from sources of water by a given sector 27 4 results and discussion water consumption in the province of bali indonesia has recently received much attention due to developing water scarcity in the region and conflicts between the tourism and agriculture sectors to understand the situation with water resources and analyze bali s water consumption patterns we need to learn which sectors consume more water than others and which key sectors have a greater influence on the entire water consumption process in this section we present and discuss the results obtained from the analysis 4 1 features of water consumption indicators table 3 presents data on direct water consumption and demonstrates that the amount of water directly consumed by the primary sector the agriculture sector including other food crops non food crops and the rice sector is much higher than that consumed by the processing sectors and service sectors the agriculture sector s water consumption was above 4 billion m3 and the rest of the sectors only consumed a small portion of this amount about 456 million m3 these results confirm the fact that agriculture is the main consumer of water resources in bali accounting for 89 of the total water consumption in the province the top five dominant sectors in terms of direct water use in bali province are food crops 53 3 followed by non food crops 17 8 paddies 15 7 hotels and restaurants 5 5 and other grains 2 9 the water consumption intensity of the agricultural sectors is significantly higher than that of the other sectors specifically the water consumption per unit of output was highest for forestry and its products at 7 669 m3 per million indonesian rupiah idr interestingly the overall agriculture sector consumed more than 89 of all water resources however except for forestry and its product sectors paddy maize and other food crops sectors and the non food crops sector the direct water consumption per unit produced was less than 800 m3 per million rupiah thus agriculture related sectors have a pivotal impact on the use of water resources in the case of manufacturing and services sectors the water consumption per unit of output is quite small however sectors like food beverage tobacco coffee industries paper industry paper and cardboard goods and hotels and restaurants exhibit a high level of direct water consumption and relatively high consumption per unit of output data from the padas stone and other minerals sector the timber industry and wood products the car body industry and transportation equipment other processing industries construction the crafts and minerals industry the other building materials non metal mineral goods industry and the paper industry and paper and cardboard goods sector demonstrate low direct water consumption per unit produced sometimes these sectors are overlooked by water policymakers because of their low direct water consumption 61 however these sectors consume a great amount of water resources indirectly see table 4 furthermore the data can demonstrate the composition of their direct and indirect water consumption the direct water consumption observed for the agriculture sectors are rice 83 maize 85 other food crops 90 plantation non food crops 67 and livestock 76 this indicates that the water used in their production processes is drawn from the available surface water e g river and springs and underground water resources as stated above the industrial and service sectors consume a large amount of water indirectly in this view the indirect water consumption appears to comprise a pivotal share of the water consumption in bali province appendix fig 1 if compared with the agriculture sector the amount of water consumed by the manufacturing and service sectors is quite small however the indirect water consumption of the manufacturing and service sectors is significantly higher sectors such as padas stone and other minerals 8 textile apparel and leather goods industries 10 timber industry and wood products 11 paper industry paper and cardboard goods 12 crafts and minerals industry 14 car body industry and transportation equipment 16 other processing industries 18 construction 20 transport and other transport services 23 communications post and giro 24 among others consume a small quantity of water directly but their total consumption of water is somewhat high therefore it can be presumed that these sectors consume a great amount of water indirectly as shown in table 4 this indicates that they only use a small amount of water directly in production but to produce the inputs made by the other sectors combined in their production processes a high level of water consumption is required these sectors also have a large drag effect on the water consumption of the entire bali economy this can be observed by examining the water consumption multiplier wcm and the indicator of indirect consumption see table 4 if we only consider direct water consumption sectors like livestock 5 food beverage tobacco and coffee industries 9 timber industry and wood products 11 fuels and chemical industry rubber and plastics 13 crafts and minerals industry 14 car body industry and transportation equipment 16 and other processing industries 18 would be overlooked because their direct consumption is insignificant however the indirect consumption of these sectors is predominantly high a point that can be ignored due to the high level of direct consumption of the other sectors for each cubic meter 1 m3 of water consumed directly in the livestock sector 5 an increase in production requires the consumption of an additional 38 35 m3 of water by other production sectors likewise in the food beverage tobacco coffee industries 9 each 1 m3 consumed directly requires the indirect consumption of an additional 27 58 m3 of water by the other sectors for the timber industry and wood products sector 11 for each 1 m3 of water consumed directly 22 90 m3 is consumed indirectly the level of indirect water consumption was also high for the fuels and chemical industry rubber plastics 13 the crafts and minerals industry 14 the car body industry and transportation equipment 16 other processing industries 18 and service sectors such as construction 20 and hotels and restaurants 22 which advances 3 77 m3 for each 1 m3 consumed directly these results clearly indicate that the sectors with the highest indirect water consumption are those that are normally considered to be the driving forces behind bali s economy due to the strong influence that demand for their respective products exerts on the production of the remaining sectors in other words an increase in production in these sectors requires additional inputs from the other sectors locally provincially and nationally 4 2 intersectoral water relationships table 5 exhibits the intersectoral water transaction coefficients we first notice that the maximum water transaction coefficients are relatively low and that displays most water transactions among several sectors can be unseen because these transactions are limited to a few sectors in this developed new matrix it is obvious that indirect water consumption is derived from non food crops plantation 4 as shown in table 5 the matrix discloses that for each 1 m3 of water consumed directly by the other processing industries 18 fuels chemical industry rubber plastics 13 car body industry and transportation equipment 16 and livestock 5 sustaining this water demand requires an additional 75 9 m3 61 8 m3 15 1 m3 and 14 2 m3 of water respectively to be consumed by non food crops plantation similarly for each 1 m3 of water consumed directly by the other processing industries 18 food beverage tobacco coffee industries 9 and livestock 5 requires an additional 7 1 18 0 and 14 5 m3 of water respectively to be consumed by paddy 1 on the other hand it is shown that the sectors that stand out for their purchases are food beverage tobacco and coffee industries 9 whose demand is fulfilled with products generated by rice 1 maize 2 other food crops 3 and plantation non food crops 4 with a high water content other processing industries 18 are supplied mainly by plantation non food crops 4 rice 1 other food crops 3 and forestry products 6 construction 20 is also supplied predominantly by plantation non food crops 4 and forestry products 6 the hotel and restaurants sector 22 are supplied with rice 1 maize 2 other food crops 3 and plantation non food crops 4 apart from these four sectors other significant sales are those made by the crafts and minerals industry 14 to forestry and its products 6 and trading 21 lastly we must observe that the highest ratio of sales in all sectors are transacted within the sectors that specify a high rate of self consumption with concern to water table 6 presents the matrix of intersectoral water relationships it can be read either by rows or by columns the rows of the matrix can be interpreted as the sales of water that sector i makes to the rest of sector j the column sums to the total amount of water sold by sector i the columns of matrix j lists the purchases that sector j makes from the rest of the sectors j so the row sums of this matrix provide us with an indication of the total water requirements of sector j 4 3 inter industrial linkages the inter industrial linkages analysis can determine which key sectors have a greater impact on the entire water consumption process through both purchases and or sales 16 table 7 classifies the key sectors with respect to the water consumption in the bali province regarding the backward linkages index the other food crops sector 3 shows the largest water backward linkages indices backward linkage represents that a unit increase in all sector s final demand will generate an above average increase in water consumption of other food crops likewise sectors like hotels restaurants 22 food beverage tobacco coffee industries 9 plantation non food crops 4 and fuels chemical industry rubber plastics 13 have vital influence on total water consumption under the forward linkages indices other food crops 3 plantation non food crops 4 rice crop 1 and hotels restaurants 22 are the key water consumption influencing sectors this signifies that a unit change in their final demand will cause an above average increase in water consumption in all sectors remarkably the hotels and restaurants sector 22 reveals that it has higher influence on water consumption both in its backward and forward linkages indices some sectors like livestock 5 forestry and its products 6 fishery 7 paper industry paper and cardboard goods 12 transport and other transport services 23 and financial public community cultural entertainment and other services 25 and a few other sectors in manufacturing and service sectors have backward and forward linkage indices that are less than 1 which indicates less influence on water consumption 5 limitations the total number of sectors in this paper is 54 but there are no data for the mining and basic metal industry and other metal goods sectors by excluding these two sectors we aggregated 52 sectors into 25 sectors that were aggregated based on provincial industrial classifications 7 this could create a bias because there is a larger number of different products included in one sectoral classification 39 with the non availability of direct water consumption data for some sectors particularly service sectors such as the financial public community cultural and entertainment and other services communications post and giro and transport and other transport services we have collected direct water coefficients based on the reports and documents provided by udayana university indonesia and the water statistics reports obtained from the bali statistical bureau and japan international cooperation agency jica the results are subject to considerable uncertainty and underlying variability for instance the indonesia water use data for 2005 and the economic io table for 2007 are estimated moreover the total indonesian water use has considerable uncertainty because it is based on agency estimates various agencies such as badan pusat statistik provinsi bps fao united states department of agriculture and united states geological survey use different methods to estimate water use 80 finally the regional io table used in our analysis was for the year 2007 with the latest data available was created by the bali statistical bureau however today s current economic structure is somewhat like 2007 because the tourism and agricultural sectors are still dominant sectors in this region these limitations could be mitigated by a method that performs estimates for several years to show time based developments several studies feature the same limitation unavailable water use data for each sector however to overcome this constraint boudhar adopted a measure of sectoral water use that measures the volume of freshwater drawn from the water source by a given industry including water use for industrial sectors in m3 data which were taken from the fao aquastat 6 27 64 the proportion of each sector s contribution can be derived from the vector of sectoral water use in monetary units for a selected country the available data on the economic use of water are not structured according to the same group level in this case most studies have categorized a large number of disaggregated sectors into limited or aggregated sectors that can benefit from sourcing water consumption information from available data sources which includes agricultural and related national and international organizations meteorological departments groundwater monitoring agencies industrial reports and private and government owned industries 5 79 6 policy implications the production of key industrial sectors such as rice maize other food crops plantation and livestock not only increases water consumption in other sectors but also significantly increases water demand in crucial industrial sectors and the value added by other sectors the bali provincial government and the indonesian government must focus on key industrial sectors when designing water saving policies and enhancing water use efficiency in lowland rice through water saving technology such as system of rice intensification cultivation and drip irrigation water saving varieties such as the ciherang variety and timely repair irrigation channels to minimize water leakages the other dominant service sector tourism hotels and restaurants would increase the value added by the national economic system and have a higher impact on water consumption if the water consumed by these sectors is restricted it may affect economic growth an increase in the value added of these key sectors will lead to an increase in water resources used in the whole economy moreover when designing policies the water policymakers should also consider indirect water use the manufacturing i e food beverage tobacco and coffee industry timber industry and wood products fuel and chemical industry rubber plastics crafts and minerals industry car body industry and transportation equipment and other processing industries and service sectors construction have a high level of indirect water use and less direct use a unit change in the production of a sector with high indirect water use will unavoidably be redirected to the water use of the other sectors and may lead to destructive outcomes on the water resources in bali province therefore policymakers must consider both direct and indirect consumption when formulating policies the sustainable utilization of water resources is a challenging task in many countries particularly rapid economic growth urbanization and increasing population create a high competition among key sectors in bali to maintain stability among key sectors we came up with the following plans and actions that may help to tackle the challenges 1 with regard to agriculture water use developing water saving agriculture controlling erosion and landslide management systems preventing flood and reducing leakages in the drainage system and adopting water saving technologies such as drip irrigation systems in provinces with raw water 2 with regard to tourism e g hotels and restaurants and other manufacturing industries quota water supply paid water supply and double charging can be implemented for industries that overuse groundwater sources drawing more groundwater affects the resource available to future generations therefore it is essential to consider allocating it over generations 81 3 in provinces where water resources are scarce springs should be used as a source of irrigation water cross regional integrated water supply systems should be developed low water consuming industries should be encouraged and a water recycling system should be developed 4 the dominant key sectors tourism agriculture and manufacturing industries that follow sustainable water use practices must be rewarded to serve as incentives and there should be timely support from the government to water management organizations 5 the government or water management organizations must arrange yearly meetings to invite representatives from all the industrial sectors situated in the province or region to discuss the differences in the demand and supply of water in the province and share the innovative ideas of those who have already adopted water use saving technologies for the benefit of others therefore interest groups should be formed to impact the allocation process so that the end results best serve the interest of the society and environment likewise reform efforts in water allocation which result in a redistribution of economic benefits should be implemented 81 7 conclusions in this paper the proposed approach used specified water indicators and matrices to differentiate between direct and indirect water consumption we also applied backward and forward linkage analysis to exhibit the key water intensive sectors that influence the process of total water consumption the results indicate that direct water consumption for agriculture sectors i e rice 1 followed by maize 2 other food crops 3 plantation non food crops 4 and livestock 5 was the highest however the manufacturing and service sectors consume a large amount of water indirectly in this view the amount of water consumed by the manufacturing and service sectors is quite small nevertheless indirect water consumption appears to comprise a pivotal share of total water resources for instance sectors like livestock 5 food beverage tobacco coffee industries 9 timber industry and wood products 11 fuels and chemical industry rubber and plastics 13 crafts and minerals industry 14 car body industry and transportation equipment 16 and other processing industries 18 have a high level of indirect water consumption according to the backward and forward linkages other food crops 3 rice crop 1 hotels and restaurants 22 food beverage tobacco and coffee industries 9 plantation non food crops 4 and fuels and chemical industry rubber and plastics 13 are the key influencing sectors on processing total water consumption as expected hotels and restaurants 22 are a high influencing sector both in backward and forward linkage analysis we must admit the well known fact that the greatest demand for water from the agricultural sectors the hotels and restaurants and other sectors might specifically take place during the dry season particularly from april to september moreover this might sometimes cause problems in the production process due to a lack of the main inputs needed by the sector which has consequences for the economy 61 on this basis total water consumption that is indirect consumption together with direct consumption should be taken into proper consideration when planning the production economy of a province or country the indonesia climate change sectoral roadmap synthesis report 2009 indicated that the java bali region has already faced a deficit in its water balance and competition between economic sectors in using water resources is quite high 29 in addition distributing water resources between the various economic and non economic users such private household irrigation farming communities private commercial water companies state based water distribution manufacturing industries and tourism and other business activities can be a complicated and difficult task 55 therefore our developed water matrices and indices will provide a useful tool for water and economic planning policymakers in devising sustainable water saving solutions the same methodology can account for not only productive factors but also for environmental variables moreover this study will have significant practical implications for other regions that have similar situations of water resources or competition among industries finally we are aware that this paper is basically a partial primary approach to assessing the capacity of economic activities on balinese water resources and that it could be more complete by also performing a comprehensive analysis of water consumption and economic variables such as value added and the employment generated by each sector by doing so we might obtain a comprehensible representation of the economic and environmental prominence of the water used by the different productive sectors in addition our work might also be improved by using a current io table and observing variations in the variables such as virtual water and interregional or interprovincial trade and other inclusions overtime these are some of the potential future research areas of this

8786,presence of fluoride and pathogen in drinking water is an issue of concern due to their health effects and as such much effort is being directed towards finding sustainable material for use in water treatment adsorption based water treatment techniques are often considered as the most effective and easy to use in rural set up however most of the adsorbents are not multifunction and are only effective towards fluoride in this study aluminosilicate activated clay was hydrothermally treated and applied for fluoride and pathogen removal from water fourier transform infrared ftir brunauer emmett teller method bet x ray diffraction spectroscopy xrd and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersion spectroscopy sem eds techniques were employed to characterize hydrothermally treated aluminosilicate clay htac batch defluoridation experiments were used to evaluate the fluoride removal efficiency while well diffusion assay method was used to evaluate the antimicrobial efficiency the bet results showed increase in surface area from 17 19 m2 g to 33 56 m2 g after treatment batch defluoridation showed maximum adsorption capacity of 1 75 mg g with 53 fluoride removal from initial fluoride concentration of 6 mg l using 0 8 g 40 ml dosage at initial ph 5 8 and contact time of 5 min at room temperature the adsorption kinetics data showed a better fit to pseudo second order model while the adsorption isotherm data showed correlation coefficient and chi square values of 0 98 and 0 01 respectively indicating a better fit to both langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms the regeneration studies showed that the material can be reused for up to six times using 0 1 m kcl as regenerant antimicrobial studies showed that htac has potency against escherichia coli e coli strains the study showed that synthesized htac has strong potential for application in fluoride and pathogen removal keywords aluminosilicate clay characterization defluoridation hydrothermal treatment pathogen removal 1 introduction sustainable development goals sdg s set by the united nations goal 6 1 aims at providing clean safe and affordable water to everyone across the globe by 2030 in order to eliminate waterborne diseases 1 moreover the sdg 6 1 acknowledges that billions of people mostly in rural areas still lack access to clean and affordable drinking water this calls for development of affordable easy to use and effective technologies for water treatment adsorption technique is often advocated for use in water treatment since it uses low cost and readily available materials as compared to other techniques in addition adsorption based techniques are easy to design low maintenance cost and are more flexible and efficient 2 materials such as clay 3 4 diatomaceous earth 5 porous nanohydoxyapatite 6 activated carbon 7 and activated alumina 8 have been developed for fluoride removal and have proven to be effective however these materials targets fluoride ions only the co occurrence of fluoride and pathogens in drinking water due to geogenic and anthropogenic factors respectively 9 10 necessitates the need to develop a multifunctional adsorbents which will be effective to remove both fluoride and pathogens to address this aspect 9 developed ag mgo nanoparticle modified nanohydroxyapatite adsorbent for fluoride and pathogen removal and found it to be effective towards both contaminants clay minerals are hydrous aluminosilicates materials characterized by large specific surface area chemical and mechanical stability high cation exchange capacity and layered structure which enables them to work as excellent adsorbent for both anions and cations from water moreover clays can be modified via hydrothermal treatment acid treatment and intercalation of metals on the interlayers to enhance their sorption efficiency towards inorganic and organic species from water 11 12 hydrothermal treatment process is defined as any homogenous or heterogeneous reaction in the presence of the mineralizer under high pressure and temperature conditions to dissolve and recrystallize materials that are insoluble under ordinary conditions 13 the technique has been previously applied in synthesis of zeolites and other porous products from aluminosilicate materials such as clays and coal fly ash 11 14 the hydrothermally treated materials are effective in fluoride removal and further possess antimicrobial activities 15 16 luo et al 2018 reported that hydrothermal treatment process improves the surface porosity of the material following the recrystallization nucleation and re precipitation of the dissolved si and al minerals at alkali conditions in our previous study the performance of mechanochemical treated locally available aluminosilicate rich clay soils in fluoride and pathogen removal from water was reported 17 the results obtained showed a maximum fluoride removal efficiency of 32 and zero zone of inhibition indicating that it is not effective towards pathogens when e coli strain was used therefore the present study aims at enhancing the effectiveness of the mechanochemically treated locally available aluminosilicate rich clay soils towards fluoride and pathogen removal from water through hydrothermal treatment the specific objectives were therefore i to synthesize hydrothermally treated aluminosilicate clay from locally available clay ii to evaluate the physicochemical characteristics of the synthesized hydrothermally treated aluminosilicate clay iii to determine the multi functionality of synthesized adsorbent towards fluoride and pathogen removal from water by using batch experiments iv to elucidate the sorption kinetics and nature of the adsorbent and lastly vi to examine the regeneration potential of the adsorbent 2

hydrothermally assisted aluminosilicate clay adsorbents prior to hydrothermal treatment the clay was activated mechanochemically by milling at 700 rpm using a rs200 milling machine retch green bay wi usa for 30 min 17 this was followed by hydrothermal treatment of the clay powder at the optimized conditions obtained in the preceding studies as follows 100 ml of 1 5 m naoh solution was pipetted into 250 ml heat resistant high density plastic bottles and then 2 g of the activated clay was added the mixtures were stirred on a magnetic stirrer at a temperature of 47 ᴼc at 800 rpm stirring speed for a period of 2 h 11 14 thereafter 20 ml of clay naoh slurry was transferred into a 45 ml parr bomb vessel which was sealed and placed in the furnace at temperature of 140 ᴼc for 48 h contact time the solid products formed after hydrothermal treatment were dispersed in 500 ml of deionized water to reduce the effect of high alkalinity of solution on the aluminosilicate clay adsorbent formed the suspensions were passed through 0 45 μm pore polypropylene membrane filters in order to recover the solid the solids were washed further with deionized water until near neutral ph recovered residues were then oven dried at 110 ᴼc for 6 h and then allowed to cool down in a desiccator furthermore the obtained hydrothermally treated aluminosilicate clays were milled to pass through 250 μm sieve and then stored in plastic bottles to prevent moisture ingress and labelled htac 2 3 physicochemical and mineralogical characterization the developed hydrothermally treated clay htac adsorbent was evaluated for its functional groups using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy bruker germany atr diamond ft ir spectrophotometer the total surface area pore volumes and pore sizes were measured by micromeritics tristar ii surface area and porosity unit instrument micromeritics norcross ga usa using brunauer emmett teller bet method scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate the clays morphology by using jeol 2100 electron microscope examination of the qualitative and quantitative mineral phase composition was done by employing a d8 advance x ray diffraction bruker germany equipped

001 m 0 01 m and 0 1 m kcl solutions was employed to determine point of zero charge phpzc 2 4 batch adsorption experiments batch adsorption method were conducted to evaluate contact time effect adsorbent dosage ph and adsorbate concentration on fluoride removal using htac the effect of contact time on fluoride removal and adsorption kinetics was evaluated by varying the contact time from 1 to 80 min at 200 rpm agitation using 0 8 g 40 ml adsorbent dosage and initial fluoride concentration of 10 mg l with ph of 6 0 5 the obtained mixtures were centrifuged for 30 min at 4000 rpm after agitating and the supernatants analyzed for residual fluoride concentration using orion ion selective electrode ise 9609bnwp with the detection limit of 0 01 mg l the electrode was calibrated using 0 1 1 10 and 100 mg l standards tisab iii solution was added to both standards and samples at volume ratio of 1 10 to decomplex fluoride ions the effect of adsorbent dosage in fluoride removal was evaluated by varying adsorbent dosage from 0 1 to 1 0 g 40 ml solution containing 10 mg l fluoride with ph of 6 0 5 was used as an adsorbate mixtures were agitated for optimum contact time of 5 min at 200 rpm the adsorption isotherms were studied by varying the initial concentration of the fluoride ions from 1 to 100 mg l using optimum adsorbent dosage of 0 8 g 40 ml and agitation time of 5 min at 200 rpm shaking speed to evaluate the effect of ph in fluoride removal the solution ph was adjusted from 2 to 12 using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl respectively the initial concentration of 10 mg l adsorbent dosage of 0 8 g 40 ml and contact time of 5 min at 200 rpm speed were maintained to evaluate the effect of co existing ions in fluoride removal experiment was conducted under optimum

chloride nitrate phosphate and sulphate all the experiments were done in duplicates for accuracy the percentage fluoride removal and adsorption capacity were determined from equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 f removal c o c e c o 100 2 q e c o c e v m where qe is the adsorption capacity in mg g co and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of fluoride respectively in mg l v is the volume of the solution in liters and m is the mass in gram 2 5 regeneration potential experiments fluoride loaded htac was regenerated by agitating 0 8 g of loaded htac separately with 100 ml of 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m kcl on a mechanical shaker for 30 min thereafter the mixtures were filtered using a 0 45 μm pore membrane filter and then the resulting filtrate diluted to 100 ml and analyzed for fluoride desorbed the resulting htac residues were thoroughly washed on the filter paper with deionized water and oven dried at 110 ᴼc for 4 h batch method were carried out on the regenerated htac adsorbent the regenerated reuse experiments were repeated for up to five times 2 6 antibacterial studies antibacterial efficacy of the htac materials for pathogen removal were tested with gram negative escherichia coli e coli atcc 35218 strains by utilizing the method of well diffusion assay the inhibition zone was measured and recorded the bacterial suspensions with 0 5 mcfarland turbidity were prepared mueller hinton agar was also prepared by methods earlier described in our previous work and placed into plates which were inoculated with the strains of e coli 17 wells with 6 mm diameter were bored with a cork borer and filled with 30 μl of four of the most hydrothermally treated clay materials on a single plate and then the most active material alone on a plate against the bacterial strain the plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 ᴼc thereafter the growth inhibition zone diameters were measured the agar plates and samples used in this study were carefully packaged in disposable plastic bags sealed and sent for immediate destruction as soon as measurements were concluded 3 results and discussions 3 1 physicochemical characterization 3 1 1 fourier transform infra red ftir analysis fig 1 presents the ftir spectra and functional groups of the mechanochemically activated aluminosilicate clay mac htac and htac after fluoride removal the mac showed major absorbance bands at wavelength region of 3400 1620 1005 950 and 650 cm 1 the bands at 3400 and 1620 cm 1 are attributed to the hydroxyl groups within the clay interlayers and the absorbed moisture the bands around 1005 cm 1 to lower wavelength regions are associated with the vibration and stretching of si o si si o al and al o al functional groups which are the building blocks of the aluminosilicate materials after hydrothermal treatment the hydroxyl bonds at 3400 and 1620 cm 1 wavelength regions disappeared this could be due to dehydroxylation that occurs during hydrothermal treatment the intensity of the bands at 1000 cm 1 to lower wavelength regions which are associated to the vibrations and stretching of si o al o and si o al increased and the bands appears to be sharper than they were in the mac this could be attributed to the formation of new aluminosilicate minerals at higher treatment pressure and temperature as a results of recrystallization moreover a new bands are observed at region between 1400 and 1500 cm 1 which could be attributed na o bonds after fluoride removal the intensity of the bands decreased which could be attributed to surface complexation between si and al oxides forming si f and al f bonds 3 1 2 specific surface area determination by brunauer emmett teller bet table 1 depicts the bet surface area single point surface area pore volume and size the results showed a significant increase in the average total surface area of mac from 17 19 0 02 m2 g to 33 56 0 04 m2 g in htac the increase in surface area suggests the evolution of porosity during hydrothermal treatment following the recrystallization the increased porosity is confirmed by the increasing pore volume from 0 064 0 01 0 13 cm3 g after hydrothermal treatment the average pore diameter determined using barrett joyner halenda bjh showed an increase from 16 14 0 01 nm to 20 15 0 02 nm in htac the results showed that hydrothermal treatment increases the mesoporosity of the material and could further yield better performance of fluoride removal 3 1 3 morphology of hydrothermally treated clay fig 2 a b depicts sem micrographs of mac and htac the analysis revealed irregular honeycomb with poorly defined flakes and cylindrical pore surface of the mac fig 2a the morphology transformed into a needle rod like crystalline shapes after the hydrothermal treatment fig 2b the transformation of the structural morphology is caused by the formation of new crystalline mineral phases of zeolite type following the alkali dissolution of si and al containing minerals and subsequent re precipitation of sodium on the surface luo et al 2018 the formed structures resembles those of hydroxyl sodalite mineral reported by lou et al 2018 moreover the morphology of htac appears to be crystalline and porous which is corroborated by the bet results which showed an increase in the surface properties after treatment table 1 the eds analysis for mac and htac are presented in fig 2c d both spectra s showed si al mg fe na and ca on the surface of the materials 3 1 4 x ray diffraction xrd x ray diffraction spectra for mac and htac are presented in fig 3 the x ray spectra showed the presence of montomorillonite mo microcline mi muscovite m actinolite ac quartz q and albite a mineral phases in the mac after hydrothermal treatment there was appearance of some new peaks which were matched to hydroxy sodalite hy phillipsite ph and chlorite ch minerals 18 the newly formed minerals are closely linked to zeolite mineral phases the reaction mechanism includes the dissolution of aluminosilicates material in the parent material under alkali treatment to release si and al which is followed by re precipitation nucleation and recrystallization during hydrothermal treatment this process of recrystallization and nucleation lead to formation of needle like structure as determined by sem micrographs fig 2 the ftir showed the stronger intensity for si o and al o bands as well as the formation of new bonds related to na o which confirms the formation of new mineral phases as indicated from xrd results in addition the surface area analysis also confirmed the formation of new highly porous materials which is the nature of crystalline material 3 2 batch defluoridation 3 2 1 effect of contact time and adsorption kinetics fig 4 depicts the variation of percent fluoride removal by htac with contact time a sharp increase in percentage fluoride removal from 37 to 40 was observed with increasing in contact time from 1 to 5 min this could be due to availability of more active sorption sites on the surface of the adsorbent 17 after 5 min the rate of fluoride removal was stabilized indicating that the system has attained the equilibrium and the active surface sites were occupied by fluoride ions leading to slower adsorption rate hence 5 min was adopted as the optimum contact time and was applied in subsequent experiments the adsorption data obtained at different contact times was fitted into the nonlinear equations of pseudo first order and pseudo second order of reaction kinetics models as well as the weber morris intra particle diffusion model in order to gain more insight on the possible adsorption mechanism as well as the rate limiting factors for fluoride adsorption onto the surface of htac 19 equations 3 and 4 depicts the nonlinear equations for pseudo first and second order reaction kinetics models 20 3 q t q e 1 e k a d t 4 q t q e 2 k 2 a d s t 1 k 2 q e 2 t where q e and q t are the adsorbed fluoride per unit mass mg g at equilibrium and time t min k ad min 1 and k 2ads g mg 1 min are rate constant values for pseudo first order and pseudo second order respectively the nonlinear plots for pseudo first order pfo and second order pso are presented in fig 5 and the models constants parameters are presented in table 2 the adsorption data yielded higher correlation coefficient value for pso r2 0 89 as compared to pfo r2 0 73 this suggests that the adsorption of fluoride ions by htac occurs via chemisorption wherein fluoride ions interact with the functional groups on the surface of htac leading to the formation of new chemical bonds such as al o f and si f as a result of ion exchange between oh group in the metal oxides and fluoride ions 21 the weber morris intra particle diffusion model is given by equation 5 22 where k i mg g min0 5 is the intra particle diffusion rate constant and is derived from the slope of t 0 5 versus qt while q t mg g is amount adsorbed per unit mass at a time t min0 5 and c mg g that gives an idea about the thickness of the boundary layer 5 q t k i t 0 5 c fig 6 present the weber morris intra particle diffusion plot the adsorption is controlled by intra particle diffusion if the plot yields straight line that passes through the origin in this case of fluoride adsorption by htac the plot exhibited dual linear which resemble phases of adsorption this behavior reflects that intra particle diffusion is not the only rate limiting step for fluoride adsorption by htac first phase of adsorption phase 1 with higher slope reflects the boundary layer adsorption wherein fluoride ions are attracted physically to the outer surface of the adsorbent second phase of adsorption phase 2 with gentle slope shows the diffusion of fluoride ions onto the mesopores of the adsorbent which is followed by subsequent interaction and surface complextion between fluoride ions and the molecules within the pores of the adsorbent leading to chemisorption similar observation were made by refs 21 23 the rate constant ki at phase 1 was found to be higher than the rate observed in phase 2 table 2 this observation suggests that the first phase of adsorption involving the physical attraction of fluoride ions to the boundary of htac was much faster the value of c determined from the intercept in the plots correspond to the boundary layer thickness is higher in phase 2 than phase 1 suggesting the stronger effect of the boundary layer limiting the diffusion of fluoride ion onto the pores of the adsorbent 23 3 2 2 effect of adsorbent dosage fig 7 depicts variation of percentage fluoride removal and adsorption capacity with adsorbent dosage the fluoride sorption increased steadily from 41 to 52 at adsorbent dosage of 0 1 0 8 g and thereafter stabilized fig 7 as adsorbent dosage increases more sites and surfaces become readily available for fluoride sorption hence there was increase in percent fluoride removal further increase in adsorbent dosage from 0 8 to 1 0 g resulted in equilibration as it becomes difficult for the adsorbate species to access the adsorption sites as a result of surface saturation by fluoride ions the adsorption capacity decreases as the adsorbent dosage increases due to reduction in available sites as a result of fluoride uptake onto htac surfaces leading reduction in percentage fluoride removal and stabilization at 0 8 g adsorbent dosage therefore the optimum dosage of 0 8 g 40 ml was adopted for subsequent experiments 3 2 3 effect of ph fig 8 depicts the effect of ph on percentage fluoride removal by htac the percentage fluoride removal was observed to increase as the ph increased from 2 to 6 and thereafter sharply decreased to stabilize at ph 8 12 fluoride removal of about 58 was observed at optimum ph of 6 2 and decreases to about 40 at ph 8 12 fig 8 the solution ph influences the surface charges of the adsorbent and further affect the behavior of adsorbate with the adsorbent in order to determine the surface charges ph point of zero charge phpzc point where in the net surface charges equals to zero of the adsorbent was determined using the titration method and it was found to be 8 1 which is close to that of modified bentonite clay 24 this means at this ph the surface of the material is neutrally charged at ph above the phpzc the adsorbent is negatively charged while at ph below the phpzc it is positively charged therefore at ph below phpzc where the surface of htac have positive charges equation 6 the fluoride sorption could be due to electrostatic attraction to the positively charged surface equation 7 the dominance of h ions at lower ph could result in the formation of weak hf acid leading to lower fluoride adsorption at extremely acidic ph equation 8 25 at ph above phpzc fluoride uptake slows down as the surface have more negatively charged ions due to abundance of oh ions on the htac surface and hence a repulsion between the surface and fluoride ions equation 9 6 htac oh 2 h htacoh 3 h 2 o 7 htacoh h 3 o f htacoh 2 h f 2 oh 8 h f hf 9 oh 2 2 f htacf 2 2 oh 3 2 4 effect of initial fluoride concentrations and adsorption isotherms the effect of initial concentration and adsorption isotherms were evaluated by varying the initial concentration from 1 to 100 mg l the results are presented in fig 9 in terms of equilibrium concentration against adsorption capacity it is observed that the adsorption capacity increases with increasing equilibrium concentration the data was fitted to nonlinear equations of langmuir equation 10 and freundlich equation 11 adsorption isotherm models in order to describe the relationship between fluoride ions and the adsorbent molecules 26 28 10 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 11 q e k f c e 1 n where ce mg l is the equilibrium fluoride concentration qe mg g is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium qm mg g is the maximum adsorption adsorbent s monolayer capacity kl l mg is the langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant related to the affinity of the binding sites kf mg g is the empirical freundlich constant related to the adsorption capacity and 1 n is the dimensionless parameter related to the adsorption intensity the adsorption is favorable when 1 n 1 unfavorable when 1 n 1 linear when 1 n 1 and irreversible when 1 n 0 28 the nonlinear plots for langmuir and freunlich isotherm models are depicted in fig 9 and the models constant parameters are presented in table 3 the fitting plots showed regression coefficient r2 value of 0 98 as well as lower chi square x2 value of 0 01 for both langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherm models langmuir adsorption isotherm model is based on the assumption that adsorbent has the fixed number of accessible sorption sites and all active sites have the same energy moreover it assumes that once the adsorbate molecule occupies the sorption no further adsorption can occur on the same site hence no interaction between the adsorbate molecules 29 thus adsorption occurs on homogenous surface conversely freundlich isotherm model assumes that adsorption occurs on a heterogeneous surface and is multilayer adsorption 22 the better fitting to both models suggests that htac surface as both heterogeneous and homogeneous sites which promote both monolayer and multilayer adsorption this is confirmed by the sem which revealed rough and smooth sites of surfaces of the material the 1 n value for freundlich isotherm was found to be less than 1 indicating that adsorption was favorable table 3 the monolayer adsorption capacity qm determined from langmuir isotherm model was however found to be higher 11 94 mg g compared to adsorption capacity calculated from freundlich isotherm kf 1 34 mg g suggesting that the dominance of monolayer adsorption 3 2 5 effect of co existing ions water may contain other anions in addition to f that interferes with the removal of fluoride fig 10 depicts the effect of some co existing anions on fluoride uptake by the htac fluoride sorption is very much influenced by the cl as there is an appreciable reduction in percentage fluoride removal from the blank hence suggesting cl is competing with fluoride removal during defluoridation this is probably due to relatively smaller and similar size with f ions while so4 2 po4 2 no3 and co3 2 ions gave similar decrease in percentage fluoride removal respectively the attraction strength is dependent on charge magnitude and hydrated ion radius hence so4 2 po4 2 no3 and co3 2 ions have similar magnitude and charges which probably similar percentage fluoride removal the order of fluoride uptake in the presence of other co existing anions was observed as follows cl po4 2 so4 2 no3 co3 2 3 3 regeneration studies the regeneration and recyclability potential of the htac were carried out in six successive adsorption and desorption cycles at an initial fluoride concentration of 6 0 mg l ph 5 85 at 5 min contact time using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m kcl respectively the results are presented in fig 11 the percentage fluoride uptake using 0 1 m naoh as regenerant decreased from 56 at first cycle until it reaches 30 at the fifth cycle this could be due to inadequate regeneration or loss of metal oxides during regeneration the trend observed in this study followed the same pattern reported by ref 4 however the percentage fluoride removal using 0 1 m kcl as regenerant slightly decreased slightly from 60 at first cycle until about 48 at the sixth cycle showing some promising regeneration abilities hence 0 1 m kcl is a better regenerant for the developed htac adsorbent and therefore recommended for future use 3 4 field water defluoridation the efficiency of htac in fluoride removal was further tested in the field water collected from siloam community borehole in vhembe district in limpopo province south africa with physicochemical composition presented in table 4 field water was treated at its natural ph and at optimum ph of 6 5 using adsorbent dosage of 0 8 g 40 ml mixtures were agitated for 5 min optimum contact time at 200 rpm on a mechanical shaker the results are presented in table 4 along with the who guideline values for drinking water quality the fluoride levels in raw siloam water after treatments at ph 6 5 and 8 5 was found to be lower due to fluoride uptake onto the htac surface a decrease in f concentration from 6 93 to 2 89 mg l and 3 48 mg l at ph 6 5 and 8 5 respectively were observed this was attributed to presence of more oh at higher ph which interfered with fluoride uptake during defluoridation siloam water showed a lower percent fluoride removal 49 compared with 51 in simulated water due to competition of other ions with fluoride uptake during defluoridation there was a reduction in cl co3 2 and so4 2 concentrations before and after treatment table 4 the lower efficiency in field water may therefore be attributed to the competition between fluoride and other co existing ions for adsorption sites the concentration of na and mg2 cations were slightly higher after treatments indicating their leaching on to the treated water however they remain within who recommended threshold 30 in conclusion the developed htac material has the potential for application in fluoride remediation in drinking water to achieve the who target of 1 5 mg l in drinking water the material may be applied in water containing fluoride concentration below 5 mg l for optimum performance 3 5 antibacterial studies antibacterial potency of the developed htac were evaluated by the well assay method fig 12 a show the photographs of the zone of inhibition of the selected four best modified htac samples investigated the four htac samples showed close defluoridation potentials hence all the four were tested for their antibacterial activities fig 12a by using gram negative e coli strains however only one of them have a zone of inhibition of about 15 mm an indication of promising antibacterial potency against the e coli atcc 35218 strains fig 12b in our previous studies where the clay was only activated mechanochemically none of the materials showed antibacterial potency activities against the bacterial strains used 17 the potency of the developed htac may be due to the release of oh ions and the release of intra cellular reactive oxygen species on exposure of bacterial cells to the surface of hydrothermally treated clays among other factors 15 4 conclusion the mechanochemically activated aluminosilicate clay was successfully treated hydrothermally to enhance its performance towards fluoride and pathogen removal from water the htac showed optimum fluoride sorption capacity of 2 75 mg g from 6 mg l initial fluoride concentration with initial ph of 6 0 5 using 0 8 g 40 ml adsorbent dosage after 5 min agitation time at 200 rpm shaking speed at room temperature the adsorption kinetics data fitted better to pseudo second order of reaction kinetics indicating that adsorption occurred via chemisorption adsorption isotherm data showed correlation coefficient and chi square values of 0 98 and 0 01 for both langmuir and freundlich isotherm models suggesting monolayer and heterogeneous layer adsorption the presence of co existing anions inhibits fluoride uptake with cl exerting greater inhibition the developed htac regenerated and reused for up to 6 successive cycles using 0 1 m kcl and 0 1 m naoh with kcl proving to be a better regenerant antibacterial studies showed that the developed htac adsorbent have potent antibacterial activities against the gram negative e coli bacterial strains this study showed that the developed htac has the potential for application in fluoride and pathogen removal from

8786,presence of fluoride and pathogen in drinking water is an issue of concern due to their health effects and as such much effort is being directed towards finding sustainable material for use in water treatment adsorption based water treatment techniques are often considered as the most effective and easy to use in rural set up however most of the adsorbents are not multifunction and are only effective towards fluoride in this study aluminosilicate activated clay was hydrothermally treated and applied for fluoride and pathogen removal from water fourier transform infrared ftir brunauer emmett teller method bet x ray diffraction spectroscopy xrd and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersion spectroscopy sem eds techniques were employed to characterize hydrothermally treated aluminosilicate clay htac batch defluoridation experiments were used to evaluate the fluoride removal efficiency while well diffusion assay method was used to evaluate the antimicrobial efficiency the bet results showed increase in surface area from 17 19 m2 g to 33 56 m2 g after treatment batch defluoridation showed maximum adsorption capacity of 1 75 mg g with 53 fluoride removal from initial fluoride concentration of 6 mg l using 0 8 g 40 ml dosage at initial ph 5 8 and contact time of 5 min at room temperature the adsorption kinetics data showed a better fit to pseudo second order model while the adsorption isotherm data showed correlation coefficient and chi square values of 0 98 and 0 01 respectively indicating a better fit to both langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms the regeneration studies showed that the material can be reused for up to six times using 0 1 m kcl as regenerant antimicrobial studies showed that htac has potency against escherichia coli e coli strains the study showed that synthesized htac has strong potential for application in fluoride and pathogen removal keywords aluminosilicate clay characterization defluoridation hydrothermal treatment pathogen removal 1 introduction sustainable development goals sdg s set by the united nations goal 6 1 aims at providing clean safe and affordable water to everyone across the globe by 2030 in order to eliminate waterborne diseases 1 moreover the sdg 6 1 acknowledges that billions of people mostly in rural areas still lack access to clean and affordable drinking water this calls for development of affordable easy to use and effective technologies for water treatment adsorption technique is often advocated for use in water treatment since it uses low cost and readily available materials as compared to other techniques in addition adsorption based techniques are easy to design low maintenance cost and are more flexible and efficient 2 materials such as clay 3 4 diatomaceous earth 5 porous nanohydoxyapatite 6 activated carbon 7 and activated alumina 8 have been developed for fluoride removal and have proven to be effective however these materials targets fluoride ions only the co occurrence of fluoride and pathogens in drinking water due to geogenic and anthropogenic factors respectively 9 10 necessitates the need to develop a multifunctional adsorbents which will be effective to remove both fluoride and pathogens to address this aspect 9 developed ag mgo nanoparticle modified nanohydroxyapatite adsorbent for fluoride and pathogen removal and found it to be effective towards both contaminants clay minerals are hydrous aluminosilicates materials characterized by large specific surface area chemical and mechanical stability high cation exchange capacity and layered structure which enables them to work as excellent adsorbent for both anions and cations from water moreover clays can be modified via hydrothermal treatment acid treatment and intercalation of metals on the interlayers to enhance their sorption efficiency towards inorganic and organic species from water 11 12 hydrothermal treatment process is defined as any homogenous or heterogeneous reaction in the presence of the mineralizer under high pressure and temperature conditions to dissolve and recrystallize materials that are insoluble under ordinary conditions 13 the technique has been previously applied in synthesis of zeolites and other porous products from aluminosilicate materials such as clays and coal fly ash 11 14 the hydrothermally treated materials are effective in fluoride removal and further possess antimicrobial activities 15 16 luo et al 2018 reported that hydrothermal treatment process improves the surface porosity of the material following the recrystallization nucleation and re precipitation of the dissolved si and al minerals at alkali conditions in our previous study the performance of mechanochemical treated locally available aluminosilicate rich clay soils in fluoride and pathogen removal from water was reported 17 the results obtained showed a maximum fluoride removal efficiency of 32 and zero zone of inhibition indicating that it is not effective towards pathogens when e coli strain was used therefore the present study aims at enhancing the effectiveness of the mechanochemically treated locally available aluminosilicate rich clay soils towards fluoride and pathogen removal from water through hydrothermal treatment the specific objectives were therefore i to synthesize hydrothermally treated aluminosilicate clay from locally available clay ii to evaluate the physicochemical characteristics of the synthesized hydrothermally treated aluminosilicate clay iii to determine the multi functionality of synthesized adsorbent towards fluoride and pathogen removal from water by using batch experiments iv to elucidate the sorption kinetics and nature of the adsorbent and lastly vi to examine the regeneration potential of the adsorbent 2

hydrothermally assisted aluminosilicate clay adsorbents prior to hydrothermal treatment the clay was activated mechanochemically by milling at 700 rpm using a rs200 milling machine retch green bay wi usa for 30 min 17 this was followed by hydrothermal treatment of the clay powder at the optimized conditions obtained in the preceding studies as follows 100 ml of 1 5 m naoh solution was pipetted into 250 ml heat resistant high density plastic bottles and then 2 g of the activated clay was added the mixtures were stirred on a magnetic stirrer at a temperature of 47 ᴼc at 800 rpm stirring speed for a period of 2 h 11 14 thereafter 20 ml of clay naoh slurry was transferred into a 45 ml parr bomb vessel which was sealed and placed in the furnace at temperature of 140 ᴼc for 48 h contact time the solid products formed after hydrothermal treatment were dispersed in 500 ml of deionized water to reduce the effect of high alkalinity of solution on the aluminosilicate clay adsorbent formed the suspensions were passed through 0 45 μm pore polypropylene membrane filters in order to recover the solid the solids were washed further with deionized water until near neutral ph recovered residues were then oven dried at 110 ᴼc for 6 h and then allowed to cool down in a desiccator furthermore the obtained hydrothermally treated aluminosilicate clays were milled to pass through 250 μm sieve and then stored in plastic bottles to prevent moisture ingress and labelled htac 2 3 physicochemical and mineralogical characterization the developed hydrothermally treated clay htac adsorbent was

to 80 min at 200 rpm agitation using 0 8 g 40 ml adsorbent dosage and initial fluoride concentration of 10 mg l with ph of 6 0 5 the obtained mixtures were centrifuged for 30 min at 4000 rpm after agitating and the supernatants analyzed for residual fluoride concentration using orion ion selective electrode ise 9609bnwp with the detection limit of 0 01 mg l the electrode was calibrated using 0 1 1 10 and 100 mg l standards tisab iii solution was added to both standards and samples at volume ratio of 1 10 to decomplex fluoride ions the effect of adsorbent dosage in fluoride removal was

the volume of the solution in liters and m is the mass in gram 2 5 regeneration potential experiments fluoride loaded htac was regenerated by agitating 0 8 g of loaded htac separately with 100 ml of 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m kcl on a mechanical shaker for 30 min thereafter the mixtures were filtered using a 0 45 μm pore membrane filter and then the resulting filtrate diluted to 100 ml and analyzed for fluoride desorbed the resulting htac residues were thoroughly washed on the filter paper with deionized water and oven dried at 110 ᴼc for 4 h batch method were carried out on the regenerated htac adsorbent the regenerated reuse experiments were repeated for up to five times 2 6 antibacterial studies antibacterial efficacy of the htac materials for pathogen removal were tested with gram negative escherichia coli e coli atcc 35218 strains by utilizing the method of well diffusion assay the inhibition zone was measured and recorded the bacterial suspensions with 0 5 mcfarland turbidity were prepared mueller hinton agar was also prepared by methods earlier described in our previous work and placed into plates which were inoculated with the strains of e coli 17 wells with 6 mm diameter were bored with a cork borer and filled with 30 μl of four of the most hydrothermally treated clay materials on a single plate and then the most active material alone on a plate against the bacterial strain the plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 ᴼc thereafter the growth inhibition zone diameters were measured the agar plates and samples used in this study were carefully packaged in disposable plastic bags sealed and sent for immediate destruction as soon as measurements were concluded 3 results and discussions 3 1 physicochemical characterization 3 1 1 fourier transform infra red ftir analysis fig 1 presents the ftir spectra and functional groups of the mechanochemically activated aluminosilicate clay mac htac and htac after fluoride removal the mac showed major absorbance bands at wavelength region of 3400 1620 1005 950 and 650 cm 1 the bands at 3400 and 1620 cm 1 are attributed to the hydroxyl groups within the clay interlayers and the absorbed moisture the bands around 1005 cm 1 to lower wavelength regions are associated with the vibration and stretching of si o si si o al and al o al functional groups which are the building blocks of the aluminosilicate materials after hydrothermal treatment the hydroxyl bonds at 3400 and 1620 cm 1 wavelength regions disappeared this could be due to dehydroxylation that occurs during hydrothermal treatment the intensity of the bands at 1000 cm 1 to lower wavelength regions which are associated to the vibrations and stretching of si o al o and si o al increased and the bands appears to be sharper than they were in the mac this could be attributed to the formation of new aluminosilicate minerals at higher treatment pressure and temperature as a results of recrystallization moreover a new bands are observed at region between 1400 and 1500 cm 1 which could be attributed na o bonds after fluoride removal the intensity of the bands decreased which could be attributed to surface complexation between si and al oxides forming si f and al f bonds 3 1 2 specific surface area determination by brunauer emmett teller bet table 1 depicts the bet surface area single point surface area pore volume and size the results showed a significant increase in the average total surface area of mac from 17 19 0 02 m2 g to 33 56 0 04 m2 g in htac the increase in surface area suggests the evolution of porosity during hydrothermal treatment following the recrystallization the increased porosity is confirmed by the increasing pore volume from 0 064 0 01 0 13 cm3 g after hydrothermal treatment the average pore diameter determined using barrett joyner halenda bjh showed an increase from 16 14 0 01 nm to 20 15 0 02 nm in htac the results showed that hydrothermal treatment increases the mesoporosity of the material and could further yield better performance of fluoride removal 3 1 3 morphology of hydrothermally treated clay fig 2 a b depicts sem micrographs of mac and htac the analysis revealed irregular honeycomb with poorly defined flakes and cylindrical pore surface of the mac fig 2a the morphology transformed into a needle rod like crystalline shapes after the hydrothermal treatment fig 2b the transformation of the structural morphology is caused by the formation of new crystalline mineral phases of zeolite type following the alkali dissolution of si and al containing minerals and subsequent re precipitation of sodium on the surface luo et al 2018 the formed structures resembles those of hydroxyl sodalite mineral reported by lou et al 2018 moreover the morphology of htac appears to be crystalline and porous which is corroborated by the bet results which showed an increase in the surface properties after treatment table 1 the eds analysis for mac and htac are presented in fig 2c d both spectra s showed si al mg fe na and ca on the surface of the materials 3 1 4 x ray diffraction xrd x ray diffraction spectra for mac and htac are presented in fig 3 the x ray spectra showed the presence of montomorillonite mo microcline mi muscovite m actinolite ac quartz q and albite a mineral phases in the mac after hydrothermal treatment there was appearance of some new peaks which were matched to hydroxy sodalite hy phillipsite ph and chlorite ch minerals 18 the newly formed minerals are closely linked to zeolite mineral phases the reaction mechanism includes the dissolution of aluminosilicates material in the parent material under alkali treatment to release si and al which is followed by re precipitation nucleation and recrystallization during hydrothermal treatment this process of recrystallization and nucleation lead to formation of needle like structure as determined by sem micrographs fig 2 the ftir showed the stronger intensity for si o and al o bands as well as the formation of new bonds related to na o which confirms the formation of new mineral phases as indicated from xrd results in addition the surface area analysis also confirmed the formation of new highly porous materials which is the nature of crystalline material 3 2 batch defluoridation 3 2 1 effect of contact time and adsorption kinetics fig 4 depicts the variation of percent fluoride removal by htac with contact time a sharp increase in percentage fluoride removal from 37 to 40 was observed with increasing in contact time from 1 to 5 min this could be due to availability of more active sorption sites on the surface of the adsorbent 17 after 5 min the rate of fluoride removal was stabilized indicating that the system has attained the equilibrium and the active surface sites were occupied by fluoride ions leading to slower adsorption rate hence 5 min was adopted as the optimum contact time and was applied in subsequent experiments the adsorption data obtained at different contact times was fitted into the nonlinear equations of pseudo first order and pseudo second order of reaction kinetics models as well as the weber morris intra particle diffusion model in order to gain more insight on the possible adsorption mechanism as well as the rate limiting factors for fluoride adsorption onto the surface of htac 19 equations 3 and 4 depicts the nonlinear equations for pseudo first and second order reaction kinetics models 20 3 q t q e 1 e k a d t 4 q t q e 2 k 2 a d s t 1 k 2 q e 2 t where q e and q t are the adsorbed fluoride per unit mass mg g at equilibrium and time t min k ad min 1 and k 2ads g mg 1 min are rate constant values for pseudo first order and pseudo second order respectively the nonlinear plots for pseudo first order pfo and second order pso are presented in fig 5 and the models constants parameters are presented in table 2 the adsorption data yielded higher correlation coefficient value for pso r2 0 89 as compared to pfo r2 0 73 this suggests that the adsorption of fluoride ions by htac occurs via chemisorption wherein fluoride ions interact with the functional groups on the surface of htac leading to the formation of new chemical bonds such as al o f and si f as a result of ion exchange between oh group in the metal oxides and fluoride ions 21 the weber morris intra particle diffusion model is given by equation 5 22 where k i mg g min0 5 is the intra particle diffusion rate constant and is derived from the slope of t 0 5 versus qt while q t mg g is amount adsorbed per unit mass at a time t min0 5 and c mg g that gives an idea about the thickness of the boundary layer 5 q t k i t 0 5 c fig 6 present the weber morris intra particle diffusion plot the adsorption is controlled by intra particle diffusion if the plot yields straight line that passes through the origin in this case of fluoride adsorption by htac the plot exhibited dual linear which resemble phases of adsorption this behavior reflects that intra particle diffusion is not the only rate limiting step for fluoride adsorption by htac first phase of adsorption phase 1 with higher slope reflects the boundary layer adsorption wherein fluoride ions are attracted physically to the outer surface of the adsorbent second phase of adsorption phase 2 with gentle slope shows the diffusion of fluoride ions onto the mesopores of the adsorbent which is followed by subsequent interaction and surface complextion between fluoride ions and the molecules within the pores of the adsorbent leading to chemisorption similar observation were made by refs 21 23 the rate constant ki at phase 1 was found to be higher than the rate observed in phase 2 table 2 this observation suggests that the first phase of adsorption involving the physical attraction of fluoride ions to the boundary of htac was much faster the value of c determined from the intercept in the plots correspond to the boundary layer thickness is higher in phase 2 than phase 1 suggesting the stronger effect of the boundary layer limiting the diffusion of fluoride ion onto the pores of the adsorbent 23 3 2 2 effect of adsorbent dosage fig 7 depicts variation of percentage fluoride removal and adsorption capacity with adsorbent dosage the fluoride sorption increased steadily from 41 to 52 at adsorbent dosage of 0 1 0 8 g and thereafter stabilized fig 7 as adsorbent dosage increases more sites and surfaces become readily available for fluoride sorption hence there was increase in percent fluoride removal further increase in adsorbent dosage from 0 8 to 1 0 g resulted in equilibration as it becomes difficult for the adsorbate species to access the adsorption sites as a result of surface saturation by fluoride ions the adsorption capacity decreases as the adsorbent dosage increases due to reduction in available sites as a result of fluoride uptake onto htac surfaces leading reduction in percentage fluoride removal and stabilization at 0 8 g adsorbent dosage therefore the optimum dosage of 0 8 g 40 ml was adopted for subsequent experiments 3 2 3 effect of ph fig 8 depicts the effect of ph on percentage fluoride removal by htac the percentage fluoride removal was observed to increase as the ph increased from 2 to 6 and thereafter sharply decreased to stabilize at ph 8 12 fluoride removal of about 58 was observed at optimum ph of 6 2 and decreases to about 40 at ph 8 12 fig 8 the solution ph influences the surface charges of the adsorbent and further affect the behavior of adsorbate with the adsorbent in order to determine the surface charges ph point of zero charge phpzc point where in the net surface charges equals to zero of the adsorbent was determined using the titration method and it was found to be 8 1 which is close to that of modified bentonite clay 24 this means at this ph the surface of the material is neutrally charged at ph above the phpzc the adsorbent is negatively charged while at ph below the phpzc it is positively charged therefore at ph below phpzc where the surface of htac have positive charges equation 6 the fluoride sorption could be due to electrostatic attraction to the positively charged surface equation 7 the dominance of h ions at lower ph could result in the formation of weak hf acid leading to lower fluoride adsorption at extremely acidic ph equation 8 25 at ph above phpzc fluoride uptake slows down as the surface have more negatively charged ions due to abundance of oh ions on the htac surface and hence a repulsion between the surface and fluoride ions equation 9 6 htac oh 2 h htacoh 3 h 2 o 7 htacoh h 3 o f htacoh 2 h f 2 oh 8 h f hf 9 oh 2 2 f htacf 2 2 oh 3 2 4 effect of initial fluoride concentrations and adsorption isotherms the effect of initial concentration and adsorption isotherms were evaluated by varying the initial concentration from 1 to 100 mg l the results are presented in fig 9 in terms of equilibrium concentration against adsorption capacity it is observed that the adsorption capacity increases with increasing equilibrium concentration the data was fitted to nonlinear equations of langmuir equation 10 and freundlich equation 11 adsorption isotherm models in order to describe the relationship between fluoride ions and the adsorbent molecules 26 28 10 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 11 q e k f c e 1 n where ce mg l is the equilibrium fluoride concentration qe mg g is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium qm mg g is the maximum adsorption adsorbent s monolayer capacity kl l mg is the langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant related to the affinity of the binding sites kf mg g is the empirical freundlich constant related to the adsorption capacity and 1 n is the dimensionless parameter related to the adsorption intensity the adsorption is favorable when 1 n 1 unfavorable when 1 n 1 linear when 1 n 1 and irreversible when 1 n 0 28 the nonlinear plots for langmuir and freunlich isotherm models are depicted in fig 9 and the models constant parameters are presented in table 3 the fitting plots showed regression coefficient r2 value of 0 98 as well as lower chi square x2 value of 0 01 for both langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherm models langmuir adsorption isotherm model is based on the assumption that adsorbent has the fixed number of accessible sorption sites and all active sites have the same energy moreover it assumes that once the adsorbate molecule occupies the sorption no further adsorption can occur on the same site hence no interaction between the adsorbate molecules 29 thus adsorption occurs on homogenous surface conversely freundlich isotherm model assumes that adsorption occurs on a heterogeneous surface and is multilayer adsorption 22 the better fitting to both models suggests that htac surface as both heterogeneous and homogeneous sites which promote both monolayer and multilayer adsorption this is confirmed by the sem which revealed rough and smooth sites of surfaces of the material the 1 n value for freundlich isotherm was found to be less than 1 indicating that adsorption was favorable table 3 the monolayer adsorption capacity qm determined from langmuir isotherm model was however found to be higher 11 94 mg g compared to adsorption capacity calculated from freundlich isotherm kf 1 34 mg g suggesting that the dominance of monolayer adsorption 3 2 5 effect of co existing ions water may contain other anions in addition to f that interferes with the removal of fluoride fig 10 depicts the effect of some co existing anions on fluoride uptake by the htac fluoride sorption is very much influenced by the cl as there is an appreciable reduction in percentage fluoride removal from the blank hence suggesting cl is competing with fluoride removal during defluoridation this is probably due to relatively smaller and similar size with f ions while so4 2 po4 2 no3 and co3 2 ions gave similar decrease in percentage fluoride removal respectively the attraction strength is dependent on charge magnitude and hydrated ion radius hence so4 2 po4 2 no3 and co3 2 ions have similar magnitude and charges which probably similar percentage fluoride removal the order of fluoride uptake in the presence of other co existing anions was observed as follows cl po4 2 so4 2 no3 co3 2 3 3 regeneration studies the regeneration and recyclability potential of the htac were carried out in six successive adsorption and desorption cycles at an initial fluoride concentration of 6 0 mg l ph 5 85 at 5 min contact time using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m kcl respectively the results are presented in fig 11 the percentage fluoride uptake using 0 1 m naoh as regenerant decreased from 56 at first cycle until it reaches 30 at the fifth cycle this could be due to inadequate regeneration or loss of metal oxides during regeneration the trend observed in this study followed the same pattern reported by ref 4 however the percentage fluoride removal using 0 1 m kcl as regenerant slightly decreased slightly from 60 at first cycle until about 48 at the sixth cycle showing some promising regeneration abilities hence 0 1 m kcl is a better regenerant for the developed htac adsorbent and therefore recommended for future use 3 4 field water defluoridation the efficiency of htac in fluoride removal was further tested in the field water collected from siloam community borehole in vhembe district in limpopo province south africa with physicochemical composition presented in table 4 field water was treated at its natural ph and at optimum ph of 6 5 using adsorbent dosage of 0 8 g 40 ml mixtures were agitated for 5 min optimum contact time at 200 rpm on a mechanical shaker the results are presented in table 4 along with the who guideline values for drinking water quality the fluoride levels in raw siloam water after treatments at ph 6 5 and 8 5 was found to be lower due to fluoride uptake onto the htac surface a decrease in f concentration from 6 93 to 2 89 mg l and 3 48 mg l at ph 6 5 and 8 5 respectively were observed this was attributed to presence of more oh at higher ph which interfered with fluoride uptake during defluoridation siloam water showed a lower percent fluoride removal 49 compared with 51 in simulated water due to competition of other ions with fluoride uptake during defluoridation there was a reduction in cl co3 2 and so4 2 concentrations before and after treatment table 4 the lower efficiency in field water may therefore be attributed to the competition between fluoride and other co existing ions for adsorption sites the concentration of na and mg2 cations were slightly higher after treatments indicating their leaching on to the treated water however they remain within who recommended threshold 30 in conclusion the developed htac material has the potential for application in fluoride remediation in drinking water to achieve the who target of 1 5 mg l in drinking water the material may be applied in water containing fluoride concentration below 5 mg l for optimum performance 3 5 antibacterial studies antibacterial potency of the developed htac were evaluated by the well assay method fig 12 a show the photographs of the zone of inhibition of the selected four best modified htac samples investigated the four htac samples showed close defluoridation potentials hence all the four were tested for their antibacterial activities fig 12a by using gram negative e coli strains however only one of them have a zone of inhibition of about 15 mm an indication of promising antibacterial potency against the e coli atcc 35218 strains fig 12b in our previous studies where the clay was only activated mechanochemically none of the materials showed antibacterial potency activities against the bacterial strains used 17 the potency of the developed htac may be due to the release of oh ions and the release of intra cellular reactive oxygen species on exposure of bacterial cells to the surface of hydrothermally treated clays among other factors 15 4 conclusion the mechanochemically activated aluminosilicate clay was successfully treated hydrothermally to enhance its performance towards fluoride and pathogen removal from water the htac showed optimum fluoride sorption capacity of 2 75 mg g from 6 mg l initial fluoride concentration with initial ph of 6 0 5 using 0 8 g 40 ml adsorbent dosage after 5 min agitation time at 200 rpm shaking speed at room temperature the adsorption kinetics data fitted better to pseudo second order of reaction kinetics indicating that adsorption occurred via chemisorption adsorption isotherm data showed correlation coefficient and chi square values of 0 98 and 0 01 for both langmuir and freundlich isotherm models suggesting monolayer and heterogeneous layer adsorption the presence of co existing anions inhibits fluoride uptake with cl exerting greater inhibition the developed htac regenerated and reused for up to 6 successive cycles using 0 1 m kcl and 0 1 m naoh with kcl proving to be a better regenerant antibacterial studies showed that the developed htac adsorbent have potent antibacterial activities against the gram negative e coli bacterial strains this study showed that the developed htac has the potential for application in fluoride and pathogen removal from

8787,in the industrial sector of bangladesh there is a lack of standardized mechanism to account for water incorporating both efficiency and sustainability with the growing number of textile industries that rely heavily on groundwater there is a desperate need for efficient water management at the process level as well as groundwater conservation for safe manufacturing operation this current study particularly emphasizes on the groundwater withdrawal and use in different units of the wet processing facility of a textile industry two years operational water use data was utilized to develop sustainable industrial water projection siwp tool for water management for the studied textile which also estimates the potential groundwater volume that can be conserved moreover energy and economic benefits are analyzed through the saving in electricity associated with the pumping cost of groundwater abstraction and softwater production in water treatment plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords conservation groundwater depletion industrial water processing facility textile industry groundwater abstraction water management tool 1 introduction in a manufacturing industry water is required in different processing stages of production the demand of water for manufacturing industries around the world is expected to increase by 400 by the year 2050 55 being a major contributor to the industrial enterprises textile industry is the 3rd largest user of freshwater resources in the world process operations in a textile industry such as dyeing finishing desizing scouring bleaching entirely rely on water the used water volume differs based on fibers machineries and other process related equipment and operations that require water estimation shows that about 28 0 million tons of textiles are dyed every year in the textile industries which consume over 5 0 billion m3 of freshwater resources 23 the textile sector of bangladesh is the main industrial division and considered to be the number one export earner for the country 59 contribution of this sector to the national export earning is more than 80 and 12 26 in the gdp recorded during the fiscal year fy 2017 18 36 at present the textile sector of bangladesh has approximately 7 000 factories and employs more than 4 0 million workers 36 60 the textile industries mainly manufacture readymade garments rmg woven and knitwear along with other textile products for various international apparel brands 59 and the production process of these textile factories includes but not limited to yarn and fabric manufacturing wet processing washing dyeing printing and finishing and garment production moreover these factories or wet processing unit of a large composite factory have the highest ecological footprint due to its exhaustive use of freshwater energy and chemicals needed to wash dye and finish textiles 21 due to the uneven development merged with the poor urban planning the majority of the highly water intensive and polluting industrial facilities of bangladesh have been founded within the 10 industrial clusters tejgaon tongi shyampur hazaribagh savar konabari kasimpur dhaka epz bscic narayanganj dnd and fatullah of the greater dhaka region at present approximately 2 179 industrial facilities are in operation within this region of which composite textile has the highest share 738 nos and then the wet processing facilities 241 nos comprising of an area of 1 800 sq km with continuous growing rate in residential rural and forest land accumulation for industrial use these industrial clusters will face acute shortage in the drinking water supply and the threat of land subsidence due to the extreme pollution in the existing water bodies and overdependence on the groundwater sources for both domestic and industrial use respectively 56 groundwater is the chief source of freshwater supply for most industrial settings as well as city dwellers in bangladesh 27 38 about 1 500 million m3 of groundwater is consumed by the textile sector which uses approximately 980 million kwh energy i e electricity and spends 4 0 billion usd to extract this groundwater volume annually due to the inefficient use of resources lack of awareness and absence of adequate groundwater policies every year the groundwater level is declining with an average rate of 2 5 m in areas where most textile industries are located 41 46 currently the average depth in the groundwater table is reported to be of 78 0 m from the ground level which is projected to reach 132 0 m by 2030 with annual depletion rate of 5 1 m 56 fig 1 shows the declining groundwater level of narayanganj district where the industrial cluster is located during the period of 2008 to 2018 seasonal fluctuation trends were almost similar in all the 4 wells dh081 dh003 dh080 and dh082 that are in araihazar narayanganj sadar rupganj and sonargaon upazillas respectively in these wells groundwater table fluctuated between 0 52 m to around 5 64 m within this same period 9 besides the textile industries of bangladesh consume about 0 25 0 30 m3 250 300 liters of water to manufacture 1 0 kg of finished fabrics which is also a potential factor responsible for high depletion of groundwater table 25 45 moreover water demand in textile industries is increasing day by day due to the rmg export target of 50 billion and 66 25 billion usd by the year 2021 and 2030 respectively and projection reveals that such export goal will give rise to a daily water demand of over 6 75 million m3 by the year 2030 45 however as the groundwater level goes down the pumping cost increases the inadequacy of freshwater supply resources will have a direct effect on the profitability of textile industries of bangladesh 21 ref 32 identified that the adoption of improved water management techniques can effectively lower the freshwater demand in wet processing unit of a textile industry this will essentially reduce the cost together satisfying the environmental regulations and the sustainability goals efficiency in textile water use can be achieved either by replacing existing high water consuming machineries or by improving the process of current water use 22 new machinery requires a higher capital cost which has much less potential to be selected for many industrial settings thus the process improvement is the preferred and best technique the textile industries can adopt 21 22 for instance ref 10 developed an industrial water management tool and applied that in a textile industry of china this tool was prepared based on the direct and indirect water usage indicators water withdrawal consumption and assimilatiion which can help in identifying the water intensive product and processes of the textile facility however this tool is only useful for the textile enterprises that have integrated real time monitoring system in the process level operation different parameters are required to calculate the direct and indirect water usage indices for the application of the developed tool 10 in a latter study ref 11 has further improved the tool and integrated the developed tool in the dyeing and printing process plant of a textile industry this newly refurbished tool can help the textile manufacturers in understanding the operation mechanism of a specific process by displaying the water withdrawal consumption and assimilation data at the process level it also determines the optimization points that need to be taken in account for improvement of a specific type of process level technology or machninery that is water intensive and environmentally harmful as being a highly water intensive facility of the industrial enterprises textile manufacutring industries are forced to take various water conservation technologies to mitigate the water scarcity problems associated with the textile manufacturing process 11 textile industries are one of the dominant sectors responsible for the overexploitation of groundwater resources in the world 12 the increasing manufacture and other process related operations have direct impacts on human health and environmental resources which require an efficient and cost effective solution through modern and practical means 31 the environment of bangladesh and its valuable natural resources have endured intensely due to the excessive preference on rapid economic growth over the environmental health 1 as the uncertainty and risks are growing from the overstressed environmental resources which have a direct negative impact over the economic profitability and growth an escalating focus has been placed over the concepts of cleaner production and greener economy across the industrial enterprises 1 14 besides over dependence on groundwater scarcity of freshwater supply sources and growing number of textile industries have made it necessary to investigate the current water management situation in the textile sector to achieve environmental sustainability in industrial water use 3 55 through the efficient use of groundwater development of systematic processes and effective monitoring tool is critical in the industrial sector of bangladesh there is a lack of tool or technique that combines both water efficiency and sustainable production approach the current study focuses on wet processing facility of a textile industry in bangladesh and develops a water management tool named as siwp using daily data related to groundwater abstraction softwater production and usage in different processes of the wet processing facility this tool establishes a functional relationship between the input and output of the wet processing facility assists to better quantify the distribution of water among different units and finally promotes conservation of groundwater 2 methodology 2 1 general information about the textile industry a textile industry located at rupganj area under narayanganj district about 26 0 km away from dhaka city was selected for the current study this industry began its journey to the rmg sector in 2009 fig 2 the industry manufactures both woven shirts women wear pajama or trousers and knitted tee shirts polo shirts knit and infant wear fabrics the total area of this manufacturing industry is approximately 30 000 m2 and it has nearly 12 000 staffs the average daily production and embroidery capacity is recorded as 150 000 and 110 000 pcs per day 1 1 calculated based on the yearly average production output of per piece t shirt respectively moreover the industry s knitting and dyeing capacity is of 25 tons per day respectively the textile industry produces different types of knit fabrics such as single jerky interlock pique drop needle french terry and lacquered knit in order to manufacture such fabrics the industry uses cotton polyester viscose organic cotton and mixed composition of cotton i e poly cotton poly viscose etc like other textile industries of bangladesh this industry uses both yarns and raw fabrics as the raw material typically in the textile manufacturing facility imported yarn is first turned into raw fabric through warping followed by the weaving after completion of weaving raw fabric is used in dyeing followed by the procedures such as singeing desizing scouring bleaching and mercerizing after completion of dyeing process the prepared fabric goes through finishing and finally the finished fabric is produced 2 fig 3 shows the typical processes used by the rmg sector of bangladesh in manufacturing finished fabrics 2 2 water consumption details the most water intensive facility of a textile industry is its wet processing unit fig 4 in this unit water is used for dyeing washing printing finishing and other processes depending on the industry s production pattern equipment and nature of dyes used 5 15 16 34 water is mainly treated as a solvent for the processing of chemicals washing and rinsing medium and also utilized in ion exchange boiler operation cooling facilities steam drying pressing and cleansing processes 34 42 51 to supply the freshwater in the wet processing unit textile industries use both surface and groundwater as the principal sources in some instances rainwater harvesting system has been introduced for supplementary supply of water 4 the studied industry uses groundwater as the main source of water and extracts water using three deep wells with three submersible pumps to fulfill the daily production and domestic consumption demand the daily groundwater abstraction capacity of the submersible pumps is about 6 240 m3 and the extracted groundwater is reserved in the underground raw water reservoir with a tank capacity of 6 500 m3 reserved raw water cannot be used directly in the

80 m3 h wtp 2 and 100 m3 h wtp 3 respectively the generated softwater is supplied to the underground softwater reservoir which has a tank capacity of 6 500 m3 and used in the industry s wet processing facilities including dyeing washing finishing and other utilities since no recycling is performed the used chemical loaded softwater is then supplied to the industry s effluent treatment plant etp and treated wastewater is discharged to the nearby government maintained canal fig 5 based on the water consumption records for the years 2018 and 2019 80 of the total groundwater reserve is softened and used in the industry s wet processing applications and rest is used in domestic consumption the dyeing process was recorded to be the most water intensive facility of the industry which consumed about 67 of the total softwater reserve fig 6 the specific water consumption rate sp w c was estimated using eq 1 and found to be of 0 13 m3 130 l to produce 1 kg product ref 25 reported this rate to be of 0 12 m3 per kg product based on average water consumption details from some textile industries of bangladesh for sustainable production in garment manufacturing it is desirable to have specific water consumption rate between 0 05 0 10 m3 per kg garment production 2 16 44 however the specific water consumption rate for production of unit quantity of garment is clearly indicative of high water consumption behavior of the rmg industries of bangladesh 1 sp w c w u fp v where w u total amount of water used m3 and fp v total fabric production volume kg being facilitated with modern technical equipment the textile industry has different flow meters to record the water consumption details on a daily basis for different wet processing processes and domestic applications i e drinking water supply car washing gardening toilet flush etc within the industry premises however the method to determine the amount of groundwater to be extracted daily is not supported by a valid mathematical basis it is mostly experience of the managers that determines the daily amount of abstraction thus there is likelihood for abstraction of water more than that is needed it is important to mention that city dwellers as well as industries of dhaka city largely rely on groundwater 6 40 2 3 data collection and analysis daily water consumption data for different processes of the wet processing facility for the years of 2018 and 2019 were collected this raw data includes daily groundwater abstraction water use in different wet processing units domestic use receiving wastewater volume in the etp and daily discharge amount of treated effluent the data were arranged in a database that shows the daily records of water abstraction and use in different processes for each month of a year a sample of the received raw data is given in appendix a prior to developing the water management tool the received daily data were processed and a new database was created for the groundwater abstraction softwater production and water use in different wet processing units the data processing involved identification and removal of erroneous data and replacement of missing data using linearly projected

when any observation values of explanatory variable are provided 20 to achieve sustainability projected data are the baseline for constant development and improvement in industrial water usage 39 in this study a linear regression model was developed based on the data of softwater production and consumption in different wet processing facilities for the years 2018 and 2019 the total process consumption tp c was calculated based on the summed up values of daily softwater consumption in different wet processing units a total of 730 days n 730 of daily softwater production sw p data was used to calculate daily process consumption tp c the correlation between these two variables tp c and sw p were analyzed using pearson correlation coefficient pearson correlation coefficient value r 0 70 is considered as the strong correlation and values ranging between 0 50 r 0 70 are inferred as the moderate correlation between the variables 52 the pearson correlation coefficient between the two variables is found to be r 0 930 see table 1 which infers that there is a strong positive correlation between the two variables therefore the amount of softwater that must be reserved is highly related and dependent on the softwater to be used in the wet processing units of the industry by estimating the daily needed softwater amount the groundwater to be extracted can easily be calculated all the statistical analyses were performed using spss software ver 25 0 for windows 26 in this study sw p m3 day is dependent variable as the groundwater abstraction is dependent on the amount of softwater required tp c m3 day is explanatory or independent variable since the daily production volume requires the softwater that is to be reserved for usage in different wet processing facilities the regression model between these two variables can be represented by eq 2 2 sw p b 0 b 1 tp c where b 0 and b 1 are constants from the coefficients value based on the model output table 2 eq 2 can be rewritten as 3 sw p 1 038 tp c 215 686 tp c is the combination of d c u c pr c f c and w c which can be written as 4 tpc dc uc prc wc fc therefore to find the coefficient associated with each of these processes the total amount of softwater used in each process was divided by the total softwater produced in the year 2019 like eq 3 relationship between softwater use for utility unit uc and

different processes estimated by eqs 5 9 the amount of groundwater to be extracted based on the requirement of softwater to be reserved in the tank can be estimated by eq 10 it is found out that 80 of

1 model performance indicators model performance indicators are used to evaluate and validate the model through expressing a single integer value based on the similarity between the measured and predicted data 33 47 this study employs daily data of groundwater abstraction softwater production and usage in different processes of six months sep 2019 feb 2020 for evaluating the model performance the performance evaluation for the developed models gw w sw p u c pr c f c w c and d c was executed by using different model performance evaluation indicators including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index of agreement d model efficiency factor mef mean squared error mse mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse and root relative squared error rrse the evaluation indices are given as

indicators including nse mef mae mse rmse rrse and d table 3 shows the results of all the performance indices used for validating each of the models nse value ranging from to 1 is higher for a well fit model where nse 1 signifies that the developed model has an accurate capability of representing the observed values while nse 0 indicates a model as accurate as predicting the arithmetic mean of the observed values 49 it is well established to seek for an nse value close to 1 while nse 0 70 is a well model performance indicator 33 49 58 lower values of model indicators like mae mef mse rmse and rrse and higher values 1 0 of d indicate a higher model efficiency 50 all the developed models demonstrate higher nse values 0 70 mef with a closer value to 0 and d with high coefficient values 0 849 moreover in comparison with other performance indices the models manifest a better predicting capability in lieu of the observed data of water use in different processes therefore for a given amount of fabric production volume and based on the specific water consumption rate sp w c for per unit fabric product total process consumption tp c can be found out and depending on the required volume of fabric production the developed models u c pr c f c w c and d c can predict a convincing value for water consumption in different wet processing facilities softwater to be reserved sw p and groundwater to be abstracted on a daily basis gw w founded on this groundwork the sustainable industrial water projection siwp tool fig 7 has been developed using this tool the water consumption amount in each wet processing application softwater to be produced and groundwater that need to be reserved for the daily manufacturing requirement can be easily estimated given that the amount of fabric production for that specific day is provided 3 2 groundwater saving and integration of sustainable production the industrial sectors of bangladesh e g textile tannery steel paper etc consume about 9 500 000 m3 of groundwater about 98 of water supply daily while the textile sector share this amount by consuming 4 013 000 m3 of groundwater 7 43 intense reliance on the groundwater reserves as the basic freshwater supply has brought about a rapid decline in groundwater table with a depletion rate of 2 0 3 0 m avg 2 5 m every year especially at areas comprised of textile clusters 19 43 56 however being ambitious of reaching to the export goal worth of 66 25 billion usd ref 43 reported the acute risk of water supply shortage in textile industries of bangladesh where the projection of water demand will be increased by 270 30 within the year 2030 about 8 382 billion m3 per year an immense amount of economic pressure and recession will be exerted on the textile sector as well as the country s gdp growth if the water supply is not assured properly to cope with the current challenge of rapid groundwater depletion and future water supply management groundwater saving is the only doable option for the textile industries of bangladesh as there is no alternate water supply source this proposition is also supported by the fact that sustainability can be achieved in textile water consumption where ref 18 viewed that sustaining the groundwater reserves for future usage is not only effective but a viable consideration this study identified that the studied industry used to extract an amount of 600 m3 additional groundwater on a daily basis in addition to the daily abstraction as there was no specific estimation on the manufacturing water consumption requirement using the siwp tool it can be shown that 500 m3 of groundwater can be saved from extracting daily for the emergency purpose 100 m3 of additional groundwater could be reserved in the underground water reservoir the estimated amount of groundwater 500 m3 is subtracted from the actual groundwater predicting model gw w and made a comparison with the previous groundwater abstraction details of the months when the tool was not employed fig 8 estimation revealed that by employing this siwp tool with the current projection of groundwater withdrawal amount the textile industry can save up to 9 of groundwater reserve on a monthly basis based on the implementation period of 7 months aug 2019 feb 2020 it is estimated that about 91 445 m3 91 445 000 l of groundwater is saved within this period and projection based on this same rate annually this tool can help to conserve about 156 763 m3 156 763 000 l of groundwater ref 54 defined sustainable or cleaner production as the generation of goods and services through processes and systems which are non polluting preservation of energy and natural resources economically feasible safe and healthy for workforce and consumers and socially and creatively beneficial for all people working in all process level operation the reduction in groundwater abstraction through the application of siwp tool has made a successful step forward for the textile industry to the realm of cleaner or sustainable production through the savings in groundwater while creating an economically and commercially viable consideration with a tool that is affordable and easy to use the softwater production reduced to 740 384 m3 7 months implementation period aug 2019 feb 2020 from 839 752 m3 comparison period of jan 2019 jun 2019 with a percentage change of 11 83 similar level of significant change was also observed in other wet processing applications as the dyeing unit was reported to be the most water intensive facility a substantial change was also recorded in this unit with sp w c dropping down from 0 08962 m3 kg 89 62 l kg fabric to 0 07855 m3 kg 78 55 l kg fabric with a percentage change of 12 36 the overall sp w c for the fabric manufacturing decreased to 0 10114 m3 101 14 l for the production of unit quantity of fabric see table 4 in other words a sustainable specific water consumption rate is achieved through this developed methodology applied by the siwp tool 3 3 energy savings and economic benefits economic productivity in the manufacturing and its associated processes is the main driver of an industrial setting however integration of sustainable production approaches does not undermine this ultimate target of an industry rather it enhances the economic productivity by considering the involved work force used technologies associated consumers and environment 3 53 apart from the conservation of water usage in different processes and reduction in groundwater withdrawal amount the siwp tool has also the potential to generate economic benefit within this industrial periphery since there is no government regulated tariff for groundwater abstraction and discharge of wastewater for industrial settings of bangladesh economic benefit is calculated based on the savings in pumping cost associated with the groundwater withdrawal and softwater production through the wtps ref 2 reported the specific cost saving in groundwater pumping is about 170 0 bdt 2 2 conversion rate 1 usd 84 90 bdt source https cutt ly pzshqea accessed 11 march 2021 2 0 usd ton fabric calculated based on the unit fabric production for a turkish textile industry the specific energy i e electricity cost saving associated with the groundwater and softwater pumping is about 9 67 bdt h calculated based on the hourly pumping operation of the submersible pumps and wtps of the studied industry therefore the industry can acclaim annually 153 173 bdt from the electricity saving cost associated with the groundwater abstraction and softwater production moreover during this implementation period the energy saving was found to be 4 254 kwh and 3 545 kwh for the groundwater withdrawal and softwater production through the pumping operation respectively so the annual energy saving for the studied textile industry will be 13 367 kwh the siwp tool and its associated techniques is proved to be efficient means by which the industry will gain not only conservation in the groundwater resource but an economic advantage and competitiveness than other textile industries within the rmg sector of bangladesh 4 conclusion and future recommendations an effective water management solution can be achieved across the textile industries using better knowledge about the water usage in different facilities of the manufacturing process the siwp tool has demonstrated its efficient accounting capability the techniques that have been used in developing the tool demonstrate the minimization in groundwater over extraction and ensure groundwater conservation 156 763 m3 groundwater per year together with energy saving and economic viability i e 13 367 kwh and 153 173 bdt annual savings from pumping operation and electricity cost respectively thus the current study will serve as a prospective step towards meeting the greener concepts of the textile industries of bangladesh as the development of the siwp tool is embedded with the goal of sustainable production and consumption the techniques that have been employed in this study to prepare the siwp tool can be used for other textile industries of bangladesh the siwp tool is cost effective and has shown significant potential in solving the ongoing problem of groundwater table decline in dhaka city future studies can incorporate a comprehensive water usage details for a cluster of textile industries and develop separate siwp tools for each industrial cluster furthermore the siwp tool can be used in assessing the performance of sustainable

8787,in the industrial sector of bangladesh there is a lack of standardized mechanism to account for water incorporating both efficiency and sustainability with the growing number of textile industries that rely heavily on groundwater there is a desperate need for efficient water management at the process level as well as groundwater conservation for safe manufacturing operation this current study particularly emphasizes on the groundwater withdrawal and use in different units of the wet processing facility of a textile industry two years operational water use data was utilized to develop sustainable industrial water projection siwp tool for water management for the studied textile which also estimates the potential groundwater volume that can be conserved moreover energy and economic benefits are analyzed through the saving in electricity associated with the pumping cost of groundwater abstraction and softwater production in water treatment plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords conservation groundwater depletion industrial water processing facility textile industry groundwater abstraction water management tool 1 introduction in a manufacturing industry water is required in different processing stages of production the demand of water for manufacturing industries around the world is expected to increase by 400 by the year 2050 55 being a major contributor to the industrial enterprises textile industry is the 3rd largest user of freshwater resources in the world process operations in a textile industry such as dyeing finishing desizing scouring bleaching entirely rely on water the used water volume differs based on fibers machineries and other process related equipment and operations that require water estimation shows that about 28 0 million tons of textiles are dyed every year in the textile industries which consume over 5 0 billion m3 of freshwater resources 23 the textile sector of bangladesh is the main industrial division and considered to be the number one export earner for the country 59 contribution of this sector to the national export earning is more than 80 and 12 26 in the gdp recorded during the fiscal year fy 2017 18 36 at present the textile sector of bangladesh has approximately 7 000 factories and employs more than 4 0 million workers 36 60 the textile industries mainly manufacture readymade garments rmg woven and knitwear along with other textile products for various international apparel brands 59 and the production process of these textile factories includes but not limited to yarn and fabric manufacturing wet processing washing dyeing printing and finishing and garment production moreover these factories or wet processing unit of a large composite factory have the highest ecological footprint due to its exhaustive use of freshwater energy and chemicals needed to wash dye and finish textiles 21 due to the uneven development merged with the poor urban planning the majority of the highly water intensive and polluting industrial facilities of bangladesh have been founded within the 10 industrial clusters tejgaon tongi shyampur hazaribagh savar konabari kasimpur dhaka epz bscic narayanganj dnd and fatullah of the greater dhaka region at present approximately 2 179 industrial facilities are in operation within this region of which composite textile has the highest share 738 nos and then the wet processing facilities 241 nos comprising of an area of 1 800 sq km with continuous growing rate in residential rural and forest land accumulation for industrial use these industrial clusters will face acute shortage in the drinking water supply and the threat of land subsidence due to the extreme pollution in the existing water bodies and overdependence on the groundwater sources for both domestic and industrial use respectively 56 groundwater is the chief source of freshwater supply for most industrial settings as well as city dwellers in bangladesh 27 38 about 1 500 million m3 of groundwater is consumed by the textile sector which uses approximately 980 million kwh energy i e electricity and spends 4 0 billion usd to extract this groundwater volume annually due to the inefficient use of resources lack of awareness and absence of adequate groundwater policies every year the groundwater level is declining with an average rate of 2 5 m in areas where most textile industries are located 41 46 currently the average depth in the groundwater table is reported to be of 78 0 m from the ground level which is projected to reach 132 0 m by 2030 with annual depletion rate of 5 1 m 56 fig 1 shows the declining groundwater level of narayanganj district where the industrial cluster is located during the period of 2008 to 2018 seasonal fluctuation trends were almost similar in all the 4 wells dh081 dh003 dh080 and dh082 that are in araihazar narayanganj sadar rupganj and sonargaon upazillas respectively in these wells groundwater table fluctuated between 0 52 m to around 5 64 m within this same period 9 besides the textile industries of bangladesh consume about 0 25 0 30 m3 250 300 liters of water to manufacture 1 0 kg of finished fabrics which is also a potential factor responsible for high depletion of groundwater table 25 45 moreover water demand in textile industries is increasing day by day due to the rmg export target of 50 billion and 66 25 billion usd by the year 2021 and 2030 respectively and projection reveals that such export goal will give rise to a daily water demand of over 6 75 million m3 by the year 2030 45 however as the groundwater level goes down the pumping cost increases the inadequacy of freshwater supply resources will have a direct effect on the profitability of textile industries of bangladesh 21 ref 32 identified that the adoption of improved water management techniques can effectively lower the freshwater demand in wet processing unit of a textile industry this will essentially reduce the cost together satisfying the environmental regulations and the sustainability goals efficiency in textile water use can be achieved either by replacing existing high water consuming machineries or by improving the process of current water use 22 new machinery requires a higher capital cost which has much less potential to be selected for many industrial settings thus the process improvement is the preferred and best technique the textile industries can adopt 21 22 for instance ref 10 developed an industrial water management tool and applied that in a textile industry of china this tool was prepared based on the direct and indirect water usage indicators water withdrawal consumption and assimilatiion which can help in identifying the water intensive product and processes of the textile facility however this tool is only useful for the textile enterprises that have integrated real time monitoring system in the process level operation different parameters are required to calculate the direct and indirect water usage indices for the application of the developed tool 10 in a latter study ref 11 has further improved the tool and integrated the developed tool in the dyeing and printing process plant of a textile industry this newly refurbished tool can help the textile manufacturers in understanding the operation mechanism of a specific process by displaying the water withdrawal consumption and assimilation data at the process level it also determines the optimization points that need to be taken in account for improvement of a specific type of process level technology or machninery that is water intensive and environmentally harmful as being a highly water intensive facility of the industrial enterprises textile manufacutring industries are forced to take various water conservation technologies to mitigate the water scarcity problems associated with the textile manufacturing process 11 textile industries are one of the dominant sectors responsible for the overexploitation of groundwater resources in the world 12 the increasing manufacture and other process related operations have direct impacts on human health and environmental resources which require an efficient and cost effective solution through modern and practical means 31 the environment of bangladesh and its valuable natural resources have endured intensely due to the excessive preference on rapid economic growth over the environmental health 1 as the uncertainty and risks are growing from the overstressed environmental resources which have a direct negative impact over the economic profitability and growth an escalating focus has been placed over the concepts of cleaner production and greener economy across the industrial enterprises 1 14 besides over dependence on groundwater scarcity of freshwater supply sources and growing number of textile industries have made it necessary to investigate the current water management situation in the textile sector to achieve environmental sustainability in industrial water use 3 55 through the efficient use of groundwater development of systematic processes and effective monitoring tool is critical in the industrial sector of bangladesh there is a lack of tool or technique that combines both water efficiency and sustainable production approach the current study focuses on wet processing facility of a textile industry in bangladesh and develops a water management tool named as siwp using daily data related to groundwater abstraction softwater production and usage in different processes of the wet processing facility this tool establishes a functional relationship between the input and output of the wet processing facility assists to better quantify the distribution of water among different units and finally promotes conservation of groundwater 2 methodology 2 1 general information about the textile industry a textile industry located at rupganj area under narayanganj district about 26 0 km away from dhaka city was selected for the current study this industry began its journey to the rmg sector in 2009 fig 2 the industry manufactures both woven shirts women wear pajama or trousers and knitted tee shirts polo shirts knit and infant wear fabrics the total area of this manufacturing industry is approximately 30 000 m2 and it has nearly 12 000 staffs the average daily production and embroidery capacity is recorded as 150 000 and 110 000 pcs per day 1 1 calculated based on the yearly average production output of per piece t shirt respectively moreover the industry s knitting and dyeing capacity is of 25 tons per day respectively the textile industry produces different types of knit fabrics such as single jerky interlock pique drop needle french terry and lacquered knit in order to manufacture such fabrics the industry uses cotton polyester viscose organic cotton and mixed composition of cotton i e poly cotton poly viscose etc like other textile industries of bangladesh this industry uses both yarns and raw fabrics as the raw material typically in the textile manufacturing facility imported yarn is first turned into raw fabric through warping followed by the weaving after completion of weaving raw fabric is used in dyeing followed by the procedures such as singeing desizing scouring bleaching and mercerizing after completion of dyeing process the prepared fabric goes through finishing and finally the finished fabric is produced 2 fig 3 shows the typical processes used by the rmg sector of bangladesh in manufacturing finished fabrics 2 2 water consumption details the most water intensive facility of a textile industry is its wet processing unit fig 4 in this unit water is used for dyeing washing printing finishing and other processes depending on the industry s production pattern equipment and nature of dyes used 5 15 16 34 water is mainly treated as a solvent for the processing of chemicals washing and rinsing medium and also utilized in ion exchange boiler operation cooling facilities steam drying pressing and cleansing processes 34 42 51 to supply the freshwater in the wet processing unit textile industries use both surface and groundwater as the principal sources in some instances rainwater harvesting system has been introduced for supplementary supply of water 4 the studied industry uses groundwater as the main source of water and extracts water using three deep wells with three submersible pumps to fulfill the daily production and domestic consumption demand the daily groundwater abstraction capacity of the submersible pumps is about 6 240 m3 and the extracted groundwater is reserved in the underground raw water reservoir with a tank capacity of 6 500 m3 reserved raw water cannot be used directly in the wet processing unit due to the hardness i e ca mg of the raw water which is further softened through three water treatment plants wtps the three water treatment plants have a capacity of 60 m3 h wtp 1 80 m3 h wtp 2 and 100 m3 h wtp 3 respectively the generated softwater is supplied to the underground softwater reservoir which has a tank capacity of 6 500 m3 and used in the industry s wet processing facilities including dyeing washing finishing and other utilities since no recycling is performed the used chemical loaded softwater is then supplied to the industry s effluent treatment plant etp and treated wastewater is discharged to the nearby government maintained canal fig 5 based on the water consumption records for the years 2018 and 2019 80 of the total groundwater reserve is softened and used in the industry s wet processing applications and rest is used in domestic consumption the dyeing process was recorded to be the most water intensive facility of the industry which consumed about 67 of the total softwater reserve fig 6 the specific water consumption rate sp w c was estimated using eq 1 and found to be of 0 13 m3 130 l to produce 1 kg product ref 25 reported this rate to be of 0 12 m3 per kg product based on average water consumption details from some textile industries of bangladesh for sustainable production in garment manufacturing it is desirable to have specific water consumption rate between 0 05 0 10 m3 per kg garment production 2 16 44 however the specific water consumption rate for production of unit quantity of garment is clearly indicative of high water consumption behavior of the rmg industries of bangladesh 1 sp w c w u fp v where w u total amount of water used m3 and fp v total fabric production volume kg being facilitated with modern technical equipment the textile industry has different flow meters to record the water consumption details on a daily basis for different wet processing processes and domestic applications i e drinking water supply car washing gardening toilet flush etc within the industry premises however the method to determine the amount of groundwater to be extracted daily is not supported by a valid mathematical basis it is mostly experience of the managers that determines the daily amount of abstraction thus there is likelihood for abstraction of water more than that is needed it is important to mention that city dwellers as well as industries of dhaka city largely rely on groundwater 6 40 2 3 data collection and analysis daily water consumption data for different processes of the wet processing facility for the years of 2018 and 2019 were collected this raw data includes daily groundwater abstraction water use in different wet processing units domestic use receiving wastewater volume in the etp and daily discharge amount of treated effluent the data were arranged in a database that shows the daily records of water abstraction and use in different processes for each month of a year a sample of the received raw data is given in appendix a prior to developing the water management tool the received daily data were processed and a new database was created for the groundwater abstraction softwater production and water use in different wet processing units the data processing involved identification and removal of erroneous data and replacement of missing data using linearly projected values based on the past records the nomenclatures used in this study for different processes are given as follows total process consumption tp c dyeing d c utility u c printing pr c washing w c and finishing f c daily softwater production sw p 2 4 model tool development to develop the proposed water management tool it is required to establish relationship between the two key variables i daily total process consumption tp c and ii softwater production sw p regression analysis method was used in this regard regression analysis is performed to model the variation of the projected or predicted

when any observation values of explanatory variable are provided 20 to achieve sustainability projected data are the baseline for constant development and improvement in industrial water usage 39 in this study a linear regression model was developed based on the data of softwater production and consumption in different wet processing facilities for the years 2018 and 2019 the total process consumption tp c was calculated based on the summed up values of daily softwater consumption in different wet processing units a total of 730 days n 730 of daily softwater production sw p data was used to calculate daily process consumption tp c the correlation between these two variables tp c and sw p were analyzed using pearson correlation coefficient pearson correlation coefficient value r 0 70 is considered as the strong correlation and values ranging between 0 50 r 0 70 are inferred as the moderate correlation between the variables 52 the pearson correlation coefficient between the two variables is found to be r 0 930 see table 1 which infers that there is a strong positive correlation between the two variables therefore the amount of softwater that must be reserved is highly related and dependent on the softwater to be used in the wet processing units of the industry by estimating the daily needed softwater amount the groundwater to be extracted can easily be calculated all the statistical analyses were performed using spss software ver 25 0 for windows 26 in this study sw p m3 day is dependent variable as the groundwater abstraction is dependent on the amount of softwater required tp c m3 day is explanatory or independent variable since the daily production volume requires the softwater that is to be reserved for usage in different wet processing facilities the regression model between these two variables can be represented by eq 2 2 sw p b 0 b 1 tp c where b 0 and b 1 are constants from the coefficients value based on the model output table 2 eq 2 can be rewritten as 3 sw p 1 038 tp c 215 686 tp c is the combination of d c u c pr c f c and w c which can be written as 4 tpc dc uc prc wc fc therefore to find the coefficient associated with each of these processes the total amount of softwater used in each process was divided by the total softwater produced in the year 2019 like eq 3 relationship between softwater use for utility unit uc and

1 model performance indicators model performance indicators are used to evaluate and validate the model through expressing a single integer value based on the similarity between the measured and predicted data 33 47 this study employs daily data of groundwater abstraction softwater production and usage in different processes of six months sep 2019 feb 2020 for evaluating the model performance the performance evaluation for the developed models gw w sw p u c pr c f c w c and d c was executed by using different model performance evaluation indicators including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse

indicators including nse mef mae mse rmse rrse and d table 3 shows the results of all the performance indices used for validating each of the models nse value ranging from to 1 is higher for a well fit model where nse 1 signifies that the developed model has an accurate capability of representing the observed values while nse 0 indicates a model as accurate as predicting the arithmetic mean of the observed values 49 it is well established to seek for an nse value close to 1 while nse 0 70 is a well model performance indicator 33 49 58 lower values of model indicators like mae mef mse rmse and rrse and higher values 1 0 of d indicate a higher model efficiency 50 all the developed models demonstrate higher nse values 0 70 mef with a closer value to 0 and d with high coefficient values 0 849 moreover in comparison with other performance indices the models manifest a better predicting capability in lieu of the observed data of water use in different processes therefore for a given amount of fabric production volume and based on the specific water consumption rate sp w c for per unit fabric product total process consumption tp c can be found out and depending on the required volume of fabric production the developed models u c pr c f c w c and d c can predict a convincing value for water consumption in different wet processing facilities softwater to be reserved sw p and groundwater to be abstracted on a daily basis gw w founded on this groundwork the sustainable industrial water projection siwp tool fig 7 has been developed using this tool the water consumption amount in each wet processing application softwater to be produced and groundwater that need to be reserved for the daily manufacturing requirement can be easily estimated given that the amount of fabric production for that specific day is provided 3 2 groundwater saving and integration of sustainable production the industrial sectors of bangladesh e g textile tannery steel paper etc consume about 9 500 000 m3 of groundwater about 98 of water supply daily while the textile sector share this amount by consuming 4 013 000 m3 of groundwater 7 43 intense reliance on the groundwater reserves as the basic freshwater supply has brought about a rapid decline in groundwater table with a depletion rate of 2 0 3 0 m avg 2 5 m every year especially at areas comprised of textile clusters 19 43 56 however being ambitious of reaching to the export goal worth of 66 25 billion usd ref 43 reported the acute risk of water supply shortage in textile industries of bangladesh where the projection of water demand will be increased by 270 30 within the year 2030 about 8 382 billion m3 per year an immense amount of economic pressure and recession will be exerted on the textile sector as well as the country s gdp growth if the water supply is not assured properly to cope with the current challenge of rapid groundwater depletion and future water supply management groundwater saving is the only doable option for the textile industries of bangladesh as there is no alternate water supply source this proposition is also supported by the fact that sustainability can be achieved in textile water consumption where ref 18 viewed that sustaining the groundwater reserves for future usage is not only effective but a viable consideration this study identified that the studied industry used to extract an amount of 600 m3 additional groundwater on a daily basis in addition to the daily abstraction as there was no specific estimation on the manufacturing water consumption requirement using the siwp tool it can be shown that 500 m3 of groundwater can be saved from extracting daily for the emergency purpose 100 m3 of additional groundwater could be reserved in the underground water reservoir the estimated amount of groundwater 500 m3 is subtracted from the actual groundwater predicting model gw w and made a comparison with the previous groundwater abstraction details of the months when the tool was not employed fig 8 estimation revealed that by employing this siwp tool with the current projection of groundwater withdrawal amount the textile industry can save up to 9 of groundwater reserve on a monthly basis based on the implementation period of 7 months aug 2019 feb 2020 it is estimated that about 91 445 m3 91 445 000 l of groundwater is saved within this period and projection based on this same rate annually this tool can help to conserve about 156 763 m3 156 763 000 l of groundwater ref 54 defined sustainable or cleaner production as the generation of goods and services through processes and systems which are non polluting preservation of energy and natural resources economically feasible safe and healthy for workforce and consumers and socially and creatively beneficial for all people working in all process level operation the reduction in groundwater abstraction through the application of siwp tool has made a successful step forward for the textile industry to the realm of cleaner or sustainable production through the savings in groundwater while creating an economically and commercially viable consideration with a tool that is affordable and easy to use the softwater production reduced to 740 384 m3 7 months implementation period aug 2019 feb 2020 from 839 752 m3 comparison period of jan 2019 jun 2019 with a percentage change of 11 83 similar level of significant change was also observed in other wet processing applications as the dyeing unit was reported to be the most water intensive facility a substantial change was also recorded in this unit with sp w c dropping down from 0 08962 m3 kg 89 62 l kg fabric to 0 07855 m3 kg 78 55 l kg fabric with a percentage change of 12 36 the overall sp w c for the fabric manufacturing decreased to 0 10114 m3 101 14 l for the production of unit quantity of fabric see table 4 in other words a sustainable specific water consumption rate is achieved through this developed methodology applied by the siwp tool 3 3 energy savings and economic benefits economic productivity in the manufacturing and its associated processes is the main driver of an industrial setting however integration of sustainable production approaches does not undermine this ultimate target of an industry rather it enhances the economic productivity by considering the involved work force used technologies associated consumers and environment 3 53 apart from the conservation of water usage in different processes and reduction in groundwater withdrawal amount the siwp tool has also the potential to generate economic benefit within this industrial periphery since there is no government regulated tariff for groundwater abstraction and discharge of wastewater for industrial settings of bangladesh economic benefit is calculated based on the savings in pumping cost associated with the groundwater withdrawal and softwater production through the wtps ref 2 reported the specific cost saving in groundwater pumping is about 170 0 bdt 2 2 conversion rate 1 usd 84 90 bdt source https cutt ly pzshqea accessed 11 march 2021 2 0 usd ton fabric calculated based on the unit fabric production for a turkish textile industry the specific energy i e electricity cost saving associated with the groundwater and softwater pumping is about 9 67 bdt h calculated based on the hourly pumping operation of the submersible pumps and wtps of the studied industry therefore the industry can acclaim annually 153 173 bdt from the electricity saving cost associated with the groundwater abstraction and softwater production moreover during this implementation period the energy saving was found to be 4 254 kwh and 3 545 kwh for the groundwater withdrawal and softwater production through the pumping operation respectively so the annual energy saving for the studied textile industry will be 13 367 kwh the siwp tool and its associated techniques is proved to be efficient means by which the industry will gain not only conservation in the groundwater resource but an economic advantage and competitiveness than other textile industries within the rmg sector of bangladesh 4 conclusion and future recommendations an effective water management solution can be achieved across the textile industries using better knowledge about the water usage in different facilities of the manufacturing process the siwp tool has demonstrated its efficient accounting capability the techniques that have been used in developing the tool demonstrate the minimization in groundwater over extraction and ensure groundwater conservation 156 763 m3 groundwater per year together with energy saving and economic viability i e 13 367 kwh and 153 173 bdt annual savings from pumping operation and electricity cost respectively thus the current study will serve as a prospective step towards meeting the greener concepts of the textile industries of bangladesh as the development of the siwp tool is embedded with the goal of sustainable production and consumption the techniques that have been employed in this study to prepare the siwp tool can be used for other textile industries of bangladesh the siwp tool is cost effective and has shown significant potential in solving the ongoing problem of groundwater table decline in dhaka city future studies can incorporate a comprehensive water usage details for a cluster of textile industries and develop separate siwp tools for each industrial cluster furthermore the siwp tool can be used in assessing the performance of sustainable

8788,the concept of sustainable risk assessment in industrial wastewater treatment is vital to determine the causes and consequences of plant failure the potential wastewater related risks that could hamper the operation of the entire manufacturing facility are currently inadequately defined and under researched this work proposes a framework that includes the comparison of literature and experimental data to quantify the impact of the significant process parameters on the critical process outputs from the business perspective managing and minimising risks will be possible when the number of impact parameters is low and the relationships between different parameters are clearly understood the results show that even only the evaluation of technical risks can provide an assessment platform template for other risk types also the structured and statistically analyzed data sets applied might be further used in the design and development of machine learning platforms algorithms to inform sustainable process outcomes adjusted for various geographical locations and human factors which significantly affect the industrial water sector globally graphical abstract image 1 keywords risk water sector data analytics fmea wastewater 1 introduction the definition of the term risk is essential for the successful management of many activities and technologies 1 the risk definition can affect the outcome of policy debate the allocation of resources among safety measures and the distribution of political power in society 2 a general framework development depends on the risk definition that can be considered as a political act expressing the definers values leading to adverse consequences for a particular decision 1 no definition of the term risk can be advanced as the correct approach because there is no one definition that is suitable for all definers values 3 water risks can only be coordinated as a collective action from industry policy makers customers and citizens aiming to protect water resources and mitigate long term water related risks 4 the effectiveness of the possible risk mitigation depends on the selection of methods and tools used for the residual risk measurement 5 6 the establishment of a risk assessment framework will guide enterprises on how to reduce their impact on global water resources through development of an innovative risk management culture 7 development of new approaches to assess and evaluate various risks could open new possibilities to manage water resources worldwide 8 the risk of an emerging global water crisis is regarded as the third highest ranked risk in terms of overall impact on the industry 2 there is a clear need for the implementation of better practices and more holistic measures that can rectify risks related to water use on industrial sites in common with many other industries the water sector is formalizing explicit approaches to risk management and decision making that have formerly been implicit 9 many industries follow the accepted standards of performance and codes of practice 10 however the overall complexity of the industrial water sector may require the integrated risk analysis to better understand what drives the risk from or to the plant process or operation risk management frameworks establish a platform based on the risk identification evaluation and management to drive decision making by industrial stakeholders 11 the framework of an iterative approach recognizes that continuous improvement of the risk analysis to develop a mature capacity in risk management 12 the implementation of a portfolio of risk techniques within a water sector depends on enterprise size existing management culture and the governmental regulations 13 the implementation of a risk assessment framework should not be considered as the end point of risk management but as an inspiration for the continuous process re assessment to mitigate any potential risk 14 overall risk analysis can be considered as a tool that informs the decision making process 15 the risk management activity should reflect sensible and meaningful conclusions rather than theoretical perspectives as previously suggested 16 17 the efficient risk management of a water utility requires both methods for proper risk assessment and multiple criteria decision analysis 18 risks are not limited to the boundaries of a single enterprise and are often driven by customer pressures and increased stakeholder interest 19 thus the dependencies between suppliers customers competitors and organization must be identified assessed mitigated and monitored to the author knowledge no previous work has been carried out on the development of qualitative methods for integrated risk assessment in the wastewater sector moreover the previous business risk models were mostly used for the evaluation of risks arising from domestic water use 20 21 the emergence of industrial 4 0 technologies have enabled the detailed evaluation of various risks across business operations and supply chains 22 the identification of risks arising within the framework of industry 4 0 includes the data analysis and development of additional statistical tools 23 the structural complexity of supply chain networks significantly influences overall system complexity and can be comprehensively assessed by statistical tools i e jmp minitab tools to reduce the amount of information needed to specify the system and its components 24 heat maps are often used with the simultaneous combination of univariate and multivariate data and statistical assessments for the statistical modeling of parameters 25 previous studies have recommended a risk modeling approach framed by industry 4 0 concepts that includes a clustered heat map to reduce the model complexity and includes options for the risk ranking 26 understanding risks originating from human errors management weaknesses technological failures irrational exploitation of natural resources and generation of non disposable waste can prevent industry from accidents disruptions and financial bankruptcy 27 risk management is often linked to significant uncertainties and associated complexity which emphasize the need for the development of rigorous and sophisticated modeling approaches 28 supply chain consideration have attracted an increasing focus on wastewater related risks 29 30 the aim of this paper is to provide a tool for qualitative and quantitative risk assessment and decision support for industrial sites one single approach cannot be used to access all risk related problems 31 hence quantitative methods such as risk ranking are also required this work presents a new approach in assessing risks in a common structured way using process performance metrics to develop a real time risk ranking methodology to guide risk reduction measures and decision making a decision model is developed that combines risk ranking with multi criteria decision analysis and take uncertainties into consideration using statistical evaluation platform 2 materials and methods 2 1 risk assessment risk assessment can be performed in a closed loop implicit to fig 1 are an initial identification of the roots causing risks an analysis of roots and consequences of the risk being realized in the industrial and public water sectors a consideration of their combined outcome by evaluating the magnitude of the risk some judgement of the significance of the acceptability of the risk and then a decision to act either in risk mitigation or in demonstrating that the risk is low and the residual risk is being acceptably managed the risk assessment process is represented by the continuous control loop that is an iteration of data collection analysis and decision making fig 1 is a framework suggesting actions which can effectively manage the risk followed by any additional analysis or action to mitigate the risks the risk assessment is shown as an iterative process that can be repeated an unlimited number of times to mitigate the risks risk assessment is considered as a process that does not reduce risk alone 32 33 its purpose is to inform decision making and associated actions to manage risk in the enterprise management action related to risk mitigation assumes the responsibility has been passed to the risk owner who is accountable for action and takes responsibility for seeing the actions and its completion so that the risk is mitigated accordingly 34 the enterprise water use may exacerbate the water risk by depleting the water catchment area it relies on for sustained operations therefore companies must take measures to respond to water risk responses to water related risk range from purely financial strategies to actions that reduce demand or increase supply and usually include a mix of these actions 32 fig 1 illustrates a decision framework for analysing the consequences of industrial revenue maximization minimization of environmental impact integration of novel and cost efficient technological solutions etc and developing a response strategy when examining water use it is critical to understand when and where the water is withdrawn unlike greenhouse gas emissions which have the same impacts regardless of where the emissions are generated geographically the absolute volume of water used is often less important than the timing and location of use previous studies showed that one cubic meter used in an arid urban region poses a greater physical risk than one cubic meter used in a wet rural region because the uncertainty of water supply in the future is significantly greater 31 consequently organisations need to examine their water carbon footprint and identify whether there are any physical water risk hot spots in their value chain 2 2 risk response decision framework fig 1 illustrates the necessity to identify which risks may materialize when managing the water supply the risks must be categorized according to the literature or professional experience of the management committee through the careful audit of the available data in this work jmp sas software will be used for the statistical data evaluation and identification of appropriate control parameters the upper specification usl and lower specification lsl limits of each individual risk can be determined using literature and measured data sets using statistical evaluation tools and defined organizational limits the results of the preliminary analysis will identify gaps which require additional data collection and analysis the collected data will be classified using the jmp software with the further establishment of the statistical model and later a modified failure mode and effect analysis fmea for risk assessment in the next step the data will be validated at several industrial sites or using support of various local communities with respect to regulations and future changes in policymaking the results will be shown as a map using five risk indicators for each risk level each indicator will be color coded from green indicating low risk to red indicating high risk the output will be limited by the accuracy of the reference data from the literature and industrial sites which may contribute to some error in the model outputs however this approach is considered perturbative in nature and is the first step in identifying the major risks to the organization with the potential to be extended in the future with the more comprehensive data output 2 3 data collection the operational data is collected using literature sources 35 36 and using online monitoring tools at industrial sites a large number of different types of sensors distributed across the system is involved in the data collection this network is often associated with a distributed data storage and pre processing control units the collected data passes through many connections and middleware and therefore it is crucial to guarantee that the data is being reliably transmitted and received at the destination in a timely manner also the collected data should be properly stored for future analysis to obtain higher accuracy levels 35 however qualitative aspects of the data collection have a strong impact on the way the data can be statistically processed and evaluated using various risk assessment tools 36 the efficiency of wastewater treatment is basic indicator of wastewater treatment plant function 37 municipal wastewater is mainly comprised of water together with relatively small concentrations 0 01 of suspended and dissolved organic and inorganic solids 38 among the organic compounds present in sewage fraction are carbohydrates lignin fats soaps synthetic detergents proteins and their decomposition products etc 39 overall the wastewater plant efficiency depends on the amount and composition of wastewater on condition and type of sewer network plant operating conditions equipment design geographic location and climatic conditions 40 41 the efficiency of the wastewater plant is often associated with cod that is indirectly used to determine the concentration of organic compounds in water by measuring the mass of oxygen needed for the total oxidation to carbon dioxide 42 the wastewater processes depend largely on the level of treatment required as prescribed by the discharge permit issued by the governmental agency levels of treatment required are defined customarily as preliminary with the removal of coarse solids secondary with the substantial removal of organic material and suspended and dissolved solids and tertiary with the complete removal of organic matter and suspended solids which are typically accompanied by the reduction in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus 43 previous studies have shown that suspended solids chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen and ammonia content are main indicators of effluent quality of wastewater treatment 44 the list with output parameters can be also extended to active autotrophic biomass active heterotrophic biomass slowly biodegradable substrate biological oxygen demand bod kjeldahl nitrogen etc 45 however the inclusion of more output parameters can make the model more complicated and less accurate due to the absence of available validation data and missing equipment to characterize these parameters within the required sensitivity range 46 in the present work the risk assessment tool was developed using a case study on wastewater treatment plant wwtp used for the water cleaning from pharmaceutical production in ireland the data was collected in 2017 2018 the measurements were recorded on the daily basis in the morning the values of chemical oxygen demand cod nitrates total nitrogen phosphorus ammonia and suspended solids were determined using monitoring tools at the wastewater plant for the risk assessment model the collected data for the wastewater treatment plants were also combined with the upper and lower specification limit results which were found in the literature 47 51 and compared with the data provided by the industrial sites statistical analysis using control charts was performed on the industrial experimental data to determine the upper and lower specification limits 2 4 statistical model the risk model is based on the statistical analysis using the control charts which were generated with the jmp software control charts are defined as a graphical and analytic tool for monitoring process variation the natural variation in a process can be quantified using a set of control limits control limits help distinguish common cause variation from special cause variation typically action is taken to identify and eliminate special cause variation and to quantify the common cause variation in a process because it can determine the process capability in the present work the data was visualized using a levey jennings plot the upper and lower critical regions were introduced from the literature and collected data at the industrial site previous studies showed the critical ranges for various operating parameters 32 33 the literature data with respect to minimal and maximal values significantly varied from one study to another which was related to the variability of geographical location of cooling towers the experimental data were also provided by the industrial users to determine the outlier data which are below or above the minimal and maximal values jmp software was used to detect the outliers by visualization from three dimensional control charts the calculations using an excel model were conducted with data series from the literature that required rescaling to display minimal and maximal values of the related risk 2 5 fmea characterization and heat mapping failure mode and effect analysis fmea is the most important tool used to address the drawbacks of the conventional risk priority number calculation with the neglected group effects and interrelationships on measurements 34 a risk framework was proposed by weighing the impact of each parameter on the potential risk in water technologies the parameter weight was calculated in a systematic way and ranked according to the probability to occur from low to high risk the combined statistically processed data and normalized excel data model provides the information on low and high risk causing parameters which are inputs for the grouping and ranking of potential risks in the water sector using fmea modeling a heat map is a method of visualizing two dimensional data where the hue or intensity of color varies according to a given value criterion referred to as color shaded matrix display 52 in a clustered heat map similar color patterns are grouped together to reveal larger structural properties of the data in order to interpret the heatmap a number of rules and visualization techniques have been developed color coding which for simplicity will be limited to 3 unique colours will signal to the user the dimension status the red yellow and green colours are chosen as they are internationally recognizable 1 green color means an acceptable risk that is an event irrelevant to the general operation of the facility as a daily risk it does not require special security measures 2 yellow color illustrates a tolerable risk that is called as a moderate risk requiring intervention and providing the cost of reducing the risk that is reasonable for the damage caused 3 red color shows an unacceptable risk meaning an immediate threat to the environment and people requiring immediate steps to limit it in the model the risks were assessed using the combined results from statistical analysis and heat mapping of data the estimate of effect coefficient β can be obtained in eq 1 53 1 β x x 1 x y in eq 1 x x is the matrix for m replicates of the design x is a factor and y is a vector the equation has a unique solution which is the vector of ordinary least squares estimates in design of experiment each factor that can influence the response variable needs to be estimated individually 53 the effect can be estimated by getting the average of the responses at each level of the factor since the literature defined the risk priority number rpn as the product of three risk factors which were equally treated 34 this study considers the relative importance weights of the risk factors using a sum of products of factor effect coefficients multiplied by the measured value as shown in eq 2 2 rpn 1 n β i x i є in eq 2 β i is a factor effect coefficient є is a random error and x i is the measured concentration value on the industrial site which was continuously collected for each single risk factor nitrates phosphorus total nitrogen ammonia chemical oxygen demand total suspended solids over the time period 2 6 limitation of the present work previous studies have identified that where there is a lack of overarching company or government policy and structure around water conservation cultural attitudes to minimising water use and effluent discharge 54 55 in the present methodology only the risks related to the environmental impact health and technology will be assessed overall this work focuses on how risk assessment results can be used in decision analysis to evaluate and compare measures for the risk reduction since an integrated approach is used the work aims to include a wide range of possible scenarios and water technologies instead of analysing only a specific type of event or specific water system that may cause harm this manuscript does not deal with designing specific measures for reducing certain risks or the process of implementing and monitoring selected measures although risk assessment and decision analysis results provide a necessary basis for risk communication the present research aims to outline a general strategy for the development of a comprehensive tool for recording information regarding water system processes although risk assessments and decision analyses play an important role in crisis management this work is not focused on crisis management the financial and reputational risks i e water price market regulations basic human rights etc will be outside the scope of the current research 3 results 3 1 statistical data analysis different statistical analysis could help identify the interconnectedness of the variables to facilitate assessment of overarching trends and quantify operational performance 56 in the present study a simple and reliable predictive statistical model will be able to correlate output variables with input parameters such as nitrates and phosphorus into the wastewater 57 the recovery of nitrates and phosphorus containing nutrients from wastewater sludge reduces the burden on the reactive nitrates and phosphorus demand in the synthetic fertilizer manufacturing industry 58 the development of a platform for the control of nitrate and phosphorus input can ensure the efficient and sustainable use of sewage sludge nutrients leading to less adverse effect on the environment the water quality data for 24 months collected in 2017 2018 is summarized in fig 2 the collected data were shown as levey jennings plot to indicate fluctuations and outliers in the output parameters the control limits indicate that mostly all industrially provided parameters do not exceed the standard parameters measured in previous work 53 54 when the outliers for the nitrate and phosphorus concentrations were compared it seems that the maximal outlier in phosphorus amount increased just once in june 2018 the operator s notes indicated that this is due to the breakage of sensors which were involved in the measurement of phosphorus concentration the fluctuations in the nitrate concentration were high due to the higher concentrations of biological sludge entering the wastewater facility and significantly affecting the denitrification process the outliers in total nitrogen and ammonia concentrations were related more to the operational challenges at the wastewater facility than to seasonal changes confirming previous results 59 60 this is due to the mild weather in ireland over the entire year with an average temperature of 10 9 c the strong and significant correlation of datasets confirmed that the population abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria is relatively stable throughout the year in ireland and does not change significantly when wastewater temperature dropped in the winter months it was also observed that the cod and tss concentrations were significantly below the literature determined limits which describes the wastewater treatment plant as an efficient and sustainable facility these interactions indicate the overall excellent quality of the wastewater plant with the occasional changes in the ph and alkalinity monitored satisfactorily during the measurement recordings to avoid any risks related to environmental toxicity moreover the present data analysis has also shown that the differences in wastewater treatment in 2017 and 2018 were small 3 2 fmea characterization and heat mapping failure mode and effects analysis fmea is a method that examines potential failures in products or processes and has been used in many quality management systems 32 one important issue of fmea is the determination of the risk priorities of failure modes the fmea tool combines the human knowledge and experience to 1 identify known or potential failure modes of a product or process 2 evaluate the failures of a product or process and their effects 3 assist operators with strategies on how to minimize the risks and 4 eliminate or reduce the chance of the failures occurring in the future 68 in this work we propose a modified fmea approach system modeled risk analysis smra to determine the risk priorities of failure modes using both statistical model and risk assessment model for the wastewater treatment plant the proposed method will categorize the risks and provide recommendations on how to minimize the risks in each category using a point grading system the risk priorities are determined in terms of overall risks rather than maximum or minimum risks only incomplete and imprecise information on the evaluation of risk factors can also be considered in the smra assessment the smra assessment process includes several steps step 1 estimate the potential failure mode step 2 describe the potential effects of failure step 3 calculate the β effect coefficient step 4 determine the current process controls usl using literature step 5 measure the concentration of a parameter causing any associated risk step 6 calculate the risk priority number using eq 2 step 7 fill out the fmea form as shown in table 1 the smra form is filled out using colours in a scale green for the low risk situations to the red marked highest risk overall tss and cod have the greatest influence on the risk classification of the wastewater treatment process in the present study the rpn was classified according to the concentration of nutrients which remain in a sludge nitrate and phosphorus total nitrogen in the wastewater amount of formed ammonia and tss during treatment and cod required for the highly efficient wastewater treatment process rpn numbers below 250 belong to low risk situations and this can be expected when the concentration of tss and cod are significantly below usl whereas the other parameters can near the maximum usl value quantitatively moderate risks showed rpn values ranging from 300 to 350 when the concentration of tss is near the maximal usl value the other parameters can be equal or slightly greater than the usl whereas the cod concentration remains significantly lower than the usl value suggested by the literature or experimental site measurement high risks obtained rpn values which are greater than 350 and can be expected when high amounts of tss are formed with the concurrent high consumption of chemical oxygen in the wastewater treatment process the high risk indicates the unbalanced ecosystem with the modified chemical composition that makes the water body unsuitable for recreational purposes and human consumption when eutrophication occurs the oxygen in the water is used up surrounding living microorganisms die and high concentrations of suspended solids are formed in the pond in the present work the collected data at the industrial site was used for the validation of the fmea model table 1 shows that the selected values must be within the usl range that was statistically calculated using the industrial maximal outliers it is highly recommended to conduct the model validation using more data sets collected by various industrial sites to justify the usl range according to the increasing efficiency of the wastewater treatment technology in the next decades the proposed risk assessment method is only adequate for sites that have complete and good quality historical data detailed consistently described regularly collected because it is based on risk identification the present srma model includes six parameters which have an impact on wastewater treatment however various literature sources contain different information on the significance of input and output parameters previous studies suggested the consideration of ph value biochemical oxygen demand boc heavy metals copper lead chromium zinc phenols etc 46 however other sources indicated that ph value and boc concentrations enter the model through the input of cod parameter 61 the concentration of heavy metals and phenols are often associated with the tss material that is one of the output parameters in the present model 62 selection of the usl value and multilinear regression coefficient are two major parameters affecting the risk priority number the list of process effects of failure can be extended using the literature and observations of plant operators increased eutrophication is one of the major failures in wastewater treatment that is caused by the high anthropogenic loads of biogenic substances discharged into water bodies 63 municipal wastewaters containing large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus play of key roles in the acceleration of eutrophication intensity 64 the main direction in the prevention of eutrophication caused by wastewater discharge is to decrease nutrient loads introduced to wastewater receivers 65 the previous identification of weights for individual frequency of occurrence and the start size can also significantly impact the wastewater treatment process therefore more data collected over several years will be required from different industrial facilities to identify the most accurate descriptors for the wastewater treatments based on the results obtained the next stage of research is to develop appropriate weights for individual technological line devices this will permit a more accurate risk assessment due to the rely on the individual frequency of the parameters and the start size and less rely on the maximal significance of all risk parameters 4 discussion this work presents a research framework detailing how to identify and prevent risks in the water sector a case of risks related to eutrophication at the wastewater treatment facility has been used to develop a methodology and

experimental data sets at different global locations could facilitate the management of wastewater treatment plants the data analysis indicated that the outliers from the experimental data significantly deviate from the results which were found in the literature this indicates that more experimental data should be collected to understand these variations however control charts suggested that there is a clear correlation between the concentration of ammonia total nitrogen suspended solid and chemical oxygen demand overall fluctuations in the collected wastewater data were small indicating the effluent wastewater nutrient loading did not significant vary over the two years this can be attributed to the uniformed removal performance of the treatment plant the outliers were

assessment in the water sector as shown in fig 3 the main input variables enter a risk assessment framework with the integrated impact factors influencing the present system initially all potential risk sources can be analyzed using statistical tools then evaluated and later minimized or prevented most of the current research focuses on the risk data processing either historical or real time numerical data 66 however research on the use of combined literature and industrially collected data to prevent risk assessment is comparatively uncommon the reason for this may be linked to the

8788,the concept of sustainable risk assessment in industrial wastewater treatment is vital to determine the causes and consequences of plant failure the potential wastewater related risks that could hamper the operation of the entire manufacturing facility are currently inadequately defined and under researched this work proposes a framework that includes the comparison of literature and experimental data to quantify the impact of the significant process parameters on the critical process outputs from the business perspective managing and minimising risks will be possible when the number of impact parameters is low and the relationships between different parameters are clearly understood the results show that even only the evaluation of technical risks can provide an assessment platform template for other risk types also the structured and statistically analyzed data sets applied might be further used in the design and development of machine learning platforms algorithms to inform sustainable process outcomes adjusted for various geographical locations and human factors which significantly affect the industrial water sector globally graphical abstract image 1 keywords risk water sector data analytics fmea wastewater 1 introduction the definition of the term risk is essential for the successful management of many activities and technologies 1 the risk definition can affect the outcome of policy debate the allocation of resources among safety measures and the distribution of political power in society 2 a general framework development depends on the risk definition that can be considered as a political act expressing the definers values leading to adverse consequences for a particular decision 1 no definition of the term risk can be advanced as the correct approach because there is no one definition that is suitable for all definers values 3 water risks can only be coordinated as a collective action from industry policy makers customers and citizens aiming to protect water resources and mitigate long term water related risks 4 the effectiveness of the possible risk mitigation depends on the selection of methods and tools used for the residual risk measurement 5 6 the establishment of a risk assessment framework will guide enterprises on how to reduce their impact on global water resources through development of an innovative risk management culture 7 development of new approaches to assess and evaluate various risks could open new possibilities to manage water resources worldwide 8 the risk of an emerging global water crisis is regarded as the third highest ranked risk in terms of overall impact on the industry 2 there is a clear need for the implementation of better practices and more holistic measures that can rectify risks related to water use on industrial sites in common with many other industries the water sector is formalizing explicit approaches to risk management and decision making that have formerly been implicit 9 many industries follow the accepted standards of performance and codes of practice 10 however the overall complexity of the industrial water sector may require the integrated risk analysis to better understand what drives the risk from or to the plant process or operation risk management frameworks establish a platform based on the risk identification evaluation and management to drive decision making by industrial stakeholders 11 the framework of an iterative approach recognizes that continuous improvement of the risk analysis to develop a mature capacity in risk management 12 the implementation of a portfolio of risk techniques within a water sector depends on enterprise size existing management culture and the governmental regulations 13 the implementation of a risk assessment framework should not be considered as the end point of risk management but as an inspiration for the continuous process re assessment to mitigate any potential risk 14 overall risk analysis can be considered as a tool that informs the decision making process 15 the risk management activity should reflect sensible and meaningful conclusions rather than theoretical perspectives as previously suggested 16 17 the efficient risk management of a water utility requires both methods for proper risk assessment and multiple criteria decision analysis 18 risks are not limited to the boundaries of a single enterprise and are often driven by customer pressures and increased stakeholder interest 19 thus the dependencies between suppliers customers competitors and organization must be identified assessed mitigated and monitored to the author knowledge no previous work has been carried out on the development of qualitative methods for integrated risk assessment in the wastewater sector moreover the previous business risk models were mostly used for the evaluation of risks arising from domestic water use 20 21 the emergence of industrial 4 0 technologies have enabled the detailed evaluation of various risks across business operations and supply chains 22 the identification of risks arising within the framework of industry 4 0 includes the data analysis and development of additional statistical tools 23 the structural complexity of supply chain networks significantly influences overall system complexity and can be comprehensively assessed by statistical tools i e jmp minitab tools to reduce the amount of information needed to specify the system and its components 24 heat maps are often used with the simultaneous combination of univariate and multivariate data and statistical assessments for the statistical modeling of parameters 25 previous studies have recommended a risk modeling approach framed by industry 4 0 concepts that includes a clustered heat map to reduce the model complexity and includes options for the risk ranking 26 understanding risks originating from human errors management weaknesses technological failures irrational exploitation of natural resources and generation of non disposable waste can prevent industry from accidents disruptions and financial bankruptcy 27 risk management is often linked to significant uncertainties and associated complexity which emphasize the need for the development of rigorous and sophisticated modeling approaches 28 supply chain consideration have attracted an increasing focus on wastewater related risks 29 30 the aim of this paper is to provide a tool for qualitative and quantitative risk assessment and decision support for industrial sites one single approach cannot be used to access all risk related problems 31 hence quantitative methods such as risk ranking are also required this work presents a new approach in assessing risks in a common structured way using process performance metrics to develop a real time risk ranking methodology to guide risk reduction measures and decision making a decision model is developed that combines risk ranking with multi criteria decision analysis and take uncertainties into consideration using statistical evaluation platform 2 materials and methods 2 1 risk assessment risk assessment can be performed in a closed loop implicit to fig 1 are an initial identification of the roots causing risks an analysis of roots and consequences of the risk being realized in the industrial and public water sectors a consideration of their combined outcome by evaluating the magnitude of the risk some judgement of the significance of the acceptability of the risk and then a decision to act either in risk mitigation or in demonstrating that the risk is low and the residual risk is being acceptably managed the risk assessment process is represented by the continuous control loop that is an iteration of data collection analysis and decision making fig 1 is a framework suggesting actions which can effectively manage the risk followed by any additional analysis or action to mitigate the risks the risk assessment is shown as an iterative process that can be repeated an unlimited number of times to mitigate the risks risk assessment is considered as a process that does not reduce risk alone 32 33 its purpose is to inform decision making and associated actions to manage risk in the enterprise management action related to risk mitigation assumes the responsibility has been passed to the risk owner who is accountable for action and takes responsibility for seeing the actions and its completion so that the risk is mitigated accordingly 34 the enterprise water use may exacerbate the water risk by depleting the water catchment area it relies on for sustained operations therefore companies must take measures to respond to water risk responses to water related risk range from purely financial strategies to actions that reduce demand or increase supply and usually include a mix of these actions 32 fig 1 illustrates a decision framework for analysing the consequences of industrial revenue maximization minimization of environmental impact integration of novel and cost efficient technological solutions etc and developing a response strategy when examining water use it is critical to understand when and where the water is withdrawn unlike greenhouse gas emissions which have the same impacts regardless of where the emissions are generated geographically the absolute volume of water used is often less important than the timing and location of use previous studies showed that one cubic meter used in an arid urban region poses a greater physical risk than one cubic meter used in a wet rural region because the uncertainty of water supply in the future is significantly greater 31 consequently organisations need to examine their water carbon footprint and identify whether there are any physical water risk hot spots in their value chain 2 2 risk response decision framework fig 1 illustrates the necessity to identify which risks may materialize when managing the water supply the risks must be categorized according to the literature or professional experience of the management committee through the careful audit of the available data in this work jmp sas software will be used for the statistical data evaluation and identification of appropriate control parameters the upper specification usl and lower specification lsl limits of each individual risk can be determined using literature and measured data sets using statistical evaluation tools and defined organizational limits the results of the preliminary analysis will identify gaps which require additional data collection and analysis the collected data will be classified using the jmp software with the further establishment of the statistical model and later a modified failure mode and effect analysis fmea for risk assessment in the next step the data will be validated at several industrial sites or using support of various local communities with respect to regulations and future changes in policymaking the results will be shown as a map using five risk indicators for each risk level each indicator will be color coded from green indicating low risk to red indicating high risk the output will be limited by the accuracy of the reference data from the literature and industrial sites which may contribute to some error in the model outputs however this approach is considered perturbative in nature and is the first step in identifying the major risks to the organization with the potential to be extended in the future with the more comprehensive data output 2 3 data collection the operational data is collected using literature sources 35 36 and using online monitoring tools at industrial sites a large number of different types of sensors distributed across the system is involved in the data collection this network is often associated with a distributed data storage and pre processing control units the collected data passes through many connections and middleware and therefore it is crucial to guarantee that the data is being reliably transmitted and received at the destination in a timely manner also the collected data should be properly stored for future analysis to obtain higher accuracy levels 35 however qualitative aspects of the data collection have a strong impact on the way the data can be statistically processed and evaluated using various risk assessment tools 36 the efficiency of wastewater treatment is basic indicator of wastewater treatment plant function 37 municipal wastewater is mainly comprised of water together with relatively small concentrations 0 01 of suspended and dissolved organic and inorganic solids 38 among the organic compounds present in sewage fraction are carbohydrates lignin fats soaps synthetic detergents proteins and their decomposition products etc 39 overall the wastewater plant efficiency depends on the amount and composition of wastewater on condition and type of sewer network plant operating conditions equipment design geographic location and climatic conditions 40 41 the efficiency of the wastewater plant is often associated with cod that is indirectly used to determine the concentration of organic compounds in water by measuring the mass of oxygen needed for the total oxidation to carbon dioxide 42 the wastewater processes depend largely on the level of treatment required as prescribed by the discharge permit issued by the governmental agency levels of treatment required are defined customarily as preliminary with the removal of coarse solids secondary with the substantial removal of organic material and suspended and dissolved solids and tertiary with the complete removal of organic matter and suspended solids which are typically accompanied by the reduction in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus 43 previous studies have shown that suspended solids chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen and ammonia content are main indicators of effluent quality of wastewater treatment 44 the list with output parameters can be also extended to active autotrophic biomass active heterotrophic biomass slowly biodegradable substrate biological oxygen demand bod kjeldahl nitrogen etc 45 however the inclusion of more output parameters can make the model more complicated and less accurate due to the absence of available validation data and missing equipment to characterize these parameters within the required sensitivity range 46 in the present work the risk assessment tool was developed using a case study on wastewater treatment plant wwtp used for the water cleaning from pharmaceutical production in ireland the data was collected in 2017 2018 the measurements were recorded on the daily basis in the morning the values of chemical oxygen demand cod nitrates total nitrogen phosphorus ammonia and suspended solids were determined using monitoring tools at the wastewater plant for the risk assessment model the collected data for the wastewater treatment plants were also combined with the upper and lower specification limit results which were found in the literature 47 51 and compared with the data provided by the industrial sites statistical analysis using control charts was performed on the industrial experimental data to determine the upper and lower specification limits 2 4 statistical model the risk model is based on the statistical analysis using the control charts which were generated with the jmp software control charts are defined as a graphical and analytic tool for monitoring process variation the natural variation in a process can be quantified using a set of control limits control limits help distinguish common cause variation from special cause variation typically action is taken to identify and eliminate special cause variation and to quantify the common cause variation in a process because it can determine the process capability in the present work the data was visualized using a levey jennings plot the upper and lower critical regions were introduced from the literature and collected data at the industrial site previous studies showed the critical ranges for various operating parameters 32 33 the literature data with respect to minimal and maximal values significantly varied from one study to another which was related to the variability of geographical location of cooling towers the experimental data were also provided by the industrial users to determine the outlier data which are below or above the minimal and maximal values jmp software was used to detect the outliers by visualization from three dimensional control charts the calculations using an excel model were conducted with data series from the literature that required rescaling to display minimal and maximal values of the related risk 2 5 fmea characterization and heat mapping failure mode and effect analysis fmea is the most important tool used to address the drawbacks of the conventional risk priority number calculation with the neglected group effects and interrelationships on measurements 34 a risk framework was proposed by weighing the impact of each parameter on the potential risk in water technologies the parameter weight was calculated in a systematic way and ranked according to the probability to occur from low to high risk the combined statistically processed data and normalized excel data model provides the information on low and high risk causing parameters which are inputs for the grouping and ranking of potential risks in the water sector using fmea modeling a heat map is a method of visualizing two dimensional data where the hue or intensity of color varies according to a given value criterion referred to as color shaded matrix display 52 in a clustered heat map similar color patterns are grouped together to reveal larger structural properties of the data in order to interpret the heatmap a number of rules and visualization techniques have been developed color coding which for simplicity will be limited to 3 unique colours will signal to the user the dimension status the red yellow and green colours are chosen as they are internationally recognizable 1 green color means an acceptable risk that is an event irrelevant to the general operation of the facility as a daily risk it does not require special security measures 2 yellow color illustrates a tolerable risk that is called as a moderate risk requiring intervention and providing the cost of reducing the risk that is reasonable for the damage caused 3 red color shows an unacceptable risk meaning an immediate threat to the environment and people requiring immediate steps to limit it in the model the risks were assessed using the combined results from statistical analysis and heat mapping of data the estimate of effect coefficient β can be obtained in eq 1 53 1 β x x 1 x y in eq 1 x x is the matrix for m replicates of the design x is a factor and y is a vector the equation has a unique solution which is the vector of ordinary least squares estimates in design of experiment each factor that can influence the response variable needs to be estimated individually 53 the effect can be estimated by getting the average of the responses at each level of the factor since the literature defined the risk priority number rpn as the product of three risk factors which were equally treated 34 this study considers the relative importance weights of the risk factors using a sum of products of factor effect coefficients multiplied by the measured value as shown in eq 2 2 rpn 1 n β i x i є in eq 2 β i is a factor effect coefficient є is a random error and x i is the measured concentration value on the industrial site which was continuously collected for each single risk factor nitrates phosphorus total nitrogen ammonia chemical oxygen demand total suspended solids over the time period 2 6 limitation of the present work previous studies have identified that where there is a lack of overarching company or government policy and structure around water conservation cultural attitudes to minimising water use and effluent discharge 54 55 in the present methodology only the risks related to the environmental impact health and technology will be assessed overall this work focuses on how risk assessment results can be used in decision analysis to evaluate and compare measures for the risk reduction since an integrated approach is used the work aims to include a wide range of possible scenarios and water technologies instead of analysing only a specific type of event or specific water system that may cause harm this manuscript does not deal with designing specific measures for reducing certain risks or the process of implementing and monitoring selected measures although risk assessment and decision analysis results provide a necessary basis for risk communication the present research aims to outline a general strategy for the development of a comprehensive tool for recording information regarding water system processes although risk assessments and decision analyses play an important role in crisis management this work is not focused on crisis management the financial and reputational risks i e water price market regulations basic human rights etc will be outside the scope of the current research 3 results 3 1 statistical data analysis different statistical analysis could help identify the interconnectedness of the variables to facilitate assessment of overarching trends and quantify operational performance 56 in the present study a simple and reliable predictive statistical model will be able to correlate output variables with input parameters such as nitrates and phosphorus into the wastewater 57 the recovery of nitrates and phosphorus containing nutrients from wastewater sludge reduces the burden on the reactive nitrates and phosphorus demand in the synthetic fertilizer manufacturing industry 58 the development of a platform for the control of nitrate and phosphorus input can ensure the efficient and sustainable use of sewage sludge nutrients leading to less adverse effect on the environment the water quality data for 24 months collected in 2017 2018 is summarized in fig 2 the collected data were shown as levey jennings plot to indicate fluctuations and outliers in the output parameters the control limits indicate that mostly all industrially provided parameters do not exceed the standard parameters measured in previous work 53 54 when the outliers for the nitrate and phosphorus concentrations were compared it seems that the maximal outlier in phosphorus amount increased just once in june 2018 the operator s notes indicated that this is due to the breakage of sensors which were involved in the measurement of phosphorus concentration the fluctuations in the nitrate concentration were high due to the higher concentrations of biological sludge entering the wastewater facility and significantly affecting the denitrification process the outliers in total nitrogen and ammonia concentrations were related more to the operational challenges at the wastewater facility than to seasonal changes confirming previous results 59 60 this is due to the mild weather in ireland over the entire year with an average temperature of 10 9 c the strong and significant correlation of datasets confirmed that the population abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria is relatively stable throughout the year in ireland and does not change significantly when wastewater temperature dropped in the winter months it was also observed that the cod and tss concentrations were significantly below the literature determined limits which describes the wastewater treatment plant as an efficient and sustainable facility these interactions indicate the overall excellent quality of the wastewater plant with the occasional changes in the ph and alkalinity monitored satisfactorily during the measurement recordings to avoid any risks related to environmental toxicity moreover the present data analysis has also shown that the differences in wastewater treatment in 2017 and 2018 were small 3 2 fmea characterization and heat mapping failure mode and effects analysis fmea is a method that examines potential failures in products or processes and has been used in many quality management systems 32 one important issue of fmea is the determination of the risk priorities of failure modes the fmea tool combines the human knowledge and experience to 1 identify known or potential failure modes of a product or process 2 evaluate the failures of a product or process and their effects 3 assist operators with strategies on how to minimize the risks and 4 eliminate or reduce the chance of the failures occurring in the future 68 in this work we propose a modified fmea approach system modeled risk analysis smra to determine the risk priorities of failure modes using both statistical model and risk assessment model for the wastewater treatment plant the proposed method will categorize the risks and provide recommendations on how to minimize the risks in each category using a point grading system the risk priorities are determined in terms of overall risks rather than maximum or minimum risks only incomplete and imprecise information on the evaluation of risk factors can also be considered in the smra assessment the smra assessment process includes several steps step 1 estimate the potential failure mode step 2 describe the potential effects of failure step 3 calculate the β effect coefficient step 4 determine the current process controls usl using literature step 5 measure the concentration of a parameter causing any associated risk step 6 calculate the risk priority number using eq 2 step 7 fill out the fmea form as shown in table 1 the smra form is filled out using colours in a scale green for the low risk situations to the red marked highest risk overall tss and cod have the greatest influence on the risk classification of the wastewater treatment process in the present study the rpn was classified according to the concentration of nutrients which remain in a sludge nitrate and phosphorus total nitrogen in the wastewater amount of formed ammonia and tss during treatment and cod required for the highly efficient wastewater treatment process rpn numbers below 250 belong to low risk situations and this can be expected when the concentration of tss and cod are significantly below usl whereas the other parameters can near the maximum usl value quantitatively moderate risks showed rpn values ranging from 300 to 350 when the concentration of tss is near the maximal usl value the other parameters can be equal or slightly greater than the usl whereas the cod concentration remains significantly lower than the usl value suggested by the literature or experimental site measurement high risks obtained rpn values which are greater than 350 and can be expected when high amounts of tss are formed with the concurrent high consumption of chemical oxygen in the wastewater treatment process the high risk indicates the unbalanced ecosystem with the modified chemical composition that makes the water body unsuitable for recreational purposes and human consumption when eutrophication occurs the oxygen in the water is used up surrounding living microorganisms die and high concentrations of suspended solids are formed in the pond in the present work the collected data at the industrial site was used for the validation of the fmea model table 1 shows that the selected values must be within the usl range that was statistically calculated using the industrial maximal outliers it is highly recommended to conduct the model validation using more data sets collected by various industrial sites to justify the usl range according to the increasing efficiency of the wastewater treatment technology in the next decades the proposed risk assessment method is only adequate for sites that have complete and good quality historical data detailed consistently described regularly collected because it is based on risk identification the present srma model includes six parameters which have an impact on wastewater treatment however various literature sources contain different information on the significance of input and output parameters previous studies suggested the consideration of ph value biochemical oxygen demand boc heavy metals copper lead chromium zinc phenols etc 46 however other sources indicated that ph value and boc concentrations enter the model through the input of cod parameter 61 the concentration of heavy metals and phenols are often associated with the tss material that is one of the output parameters in the present model 62 selection of the usl value and multilinear regression coefficient are two major parameters affecting the risk priority number the list of process effects of failure can be extended using the literature and observations of plant operators increased eutrophication is one of the major failures in wastewater treatment that is caused by the high anthropogenic loads of biogenic substances discharged into water bodies 63 municipal

8789,the aim of this study was to assess the possibility of phosphorus and nitrogen recovery from the liquid fraction of digestates reject water pilot study using a two step technology where the precipitation of biogenic compounds in the form of magnesium ammonium phosphate struvite will be preceded by a deammonification process the tests confirmed the possibility of nutrient recovery from deammonification effluent a removal efficiency from 85 0 to 92 0 of po4 3 ions and from 13 0 to 21 0 of nh4 ions in the form of magnesium salt was achieved at a ph in the range of 8 7 9 0 however when the ph value was from 9 1 to 9 3 phosphate ions were precipitated not only as magnesium salts but also as calcium salts the maximum struvite crystal sizes ranged from 0 72 to 1 65 mm and was determined by the concentration of the suspended solids in the reject water whose presence was a factor limiting the crystallization of struvite keywords liquid fraction of digestates nitrogen and

some austrian states rodriguez garcia et al 7 based on the life cycle assessment lca analysis assessed that the combination of canon processes and controlled struvite precipitation proved to be the

using the processes of biological deammonification and chemical precipitation of ammonium and phosphate ions in the form of magnesium ammonium phosphate the liquid fraction of digestates redirected to the main biological line of wwtp can constitute up to 30 of the total nitrogen tn load flowing into bioreactors which increases the energy demand for aeration for its removal deammonification can enable effective removal of up to 100 of the ammonium nitrogen contained in the reject water 8 while the search for alternative sources of phosphorus and in particular the possibilities of its recovery in sewage sludge treatment processes is one of the most important issues in the world for the phosphorus industry it stands to say that the technologies used for recovery of phosphorus from the liquid fraction of digestates are still the subject of research 6 9 14 the literature presents the researcher s results for simultaneous removal and recovery of biogenic compounds in integrated reject water treatment technologies the most frequently presented technology is in the following configuration chemical phosphorus precipitation in reject water as the first stage of integrated technology and biological removal of nitrogen compounds as the second stage of integrated technology 15 16 however the subject of continuous and intensive research is technology using an inverted configuration biological nitrogen removal process as the 1st step and struvite precipitation process as the 2nd step this configuration was adopted for research in the presented paper in order to determine whether it is possible and justified from the operational point of view for the chemical precipitation of struvite the anhydrous magnesium sulfate was used as an external magnesium source the nitrogen removal was carried out in a deammonification reactor the aim of this study was not only to determine the highest p n elimination rates but also the greatest efficiency in the formation of struvite salts and the avoidance of problems with crystal growth because of ion competition due to excessively high ca2 contents the upstream deammonification process location which leads to an increase in the ph and temperature values allows one to reach the determined optimal ph and temperature value environment 8 7 9 0 and 23 28 c respectively in a resource efficient manner this lowers the operating costs of such a configuration including costs related to the purchase of alkaline compounds dosed to the map reactor and the costs of electricity related to possible aeration of the reactor in this configuration the risk from alkalinity and ammonia stand availability is limited which as in the case of the map production deammonification configuration could take place fig 1 the

processes of biological ammonium ion removal deammonification and chemical precipitation of struvite took place the research was carried out at municipal wwtp in swarzewo located in northern poland europe it is the largest facility in the polish coastal zone with sizes of 130 000 or 50 000 population equivalent pe which treats on average 15 000 to 5000 m3 d of wastewater in the sbr system at summer time and remaining period of the year respectively the mixed sludge produced in the treatment plant primary and excessive activated sludge together with the external organic cosubstrate waste

capacity 400 kg ts h ekoline pfc9000s flocculant cationic polyacrylamide is dosed to the digestate before centrifuged with a dose of approx 6 9 kg mg ts the dehydration process aims to obtain a dry matter content in the solid fraction at the level of 20 21 which is a condition of the optimization of the final composting process typical suspended solids concentrations in the centrifuge effluents are 200 mg l however during the start up phase and during digestate overload this concentration can increase significantly even above 2000 mg l the liquid fraction of the digestate reject water in an amount corresponding to 2 6 of the daily wastewater flow recycled to sbr reactors the research system was set up in the centrifuge hall building and was fed with real reject water flowing from the centrifuge 2 2 parameters of the deammonification process the investigations were carried out in a pilot scale sbr reactor with a working capacity of 250 l total capacity 500 l fig 3a a deammonification biomass from the wwtp in duisburg kasslerfeld germany was used previously for 6 months the biomass was multiplied in laboratory conditions using synthetic reject water used in previous studies e g ref 8 after transporting the pilot sbr reactor to the wwtp swarzewo the sludge was acclimated to the rejected water for a period of 21 days the one stage deammonification process was carried out at a temperature of 30 1 c the 24 h cycle of operation included 5 min of reject water filling 23 5 h working period 15 min of sedimentation and 10 min of effluent discharge intermittent aeration was used in the working period using the option of 10 min mixing and 5 min aeration at the assumed dissolved oxygen concentration of 0 5 mg o2 l the ammonium nitrogen load of the reactor was maintained in the stable working phase at 0 4 kgn m3 d the sludge age approx 7 d was used in order to increase the leaching of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob mainly in the form of flocs this strategy was also intended to increase the efficiency of removing suspended solids occurring in reject water it is also indicated that this strategy promotes increasing the load of anammox bacteria with free ammonia which inhibits the second phase of nitrification 17 the parameters of the deammonification process were adopted based on previous results of tests on a laboratory scale table 1 2 3 precipitation of biogenic compounds from the liquid fraction of digestates the procedure of p and n precipitation in insoluble salt forms was decided based on reviewing the literature and the conditions of chemical precipitation most often suggested in the literature were adopted table 2 the magnesium ion deficit was a factor limiting struvite precipitation from digestates therefore to obtain the maximum efficiency of phosphorus and nitrogen precipitation from the effluent in the form of mgnh4po4 6h2o external dosing of magnesium salts was necessary to achieve more favorable conditions for controlling struvite precipitation according to literature recommendations table 2 the doses of magnesium salts were selected so that at the same time the values of the molar ratio of magnesium to po4 3 ions were from 1 2 1 to 2 1 and the value of the molar ratio of ca mg were below 1 anhydrous magnesium sulfate minimum content 94 5 chempur was used as a magnesium supplement in pilot studies due to its alkalinity ph 7 9 to apply lower doses of alkaline compounds to correct the ph value of the reject water a solution of magnesium salt 1 ml of the solution contained 10 mg mg with a constant dose i e 250 ml for one 6 h operation cycle was added to the reactor filled with reject water 30 l volume the duration of the mixing phase was 90 min with a mixing intensity of 240 rpm after a certain period of mixing a 180 min sedimentation phase was foreseen after the sedimentation phase a drain phase of purified reject water was adopted which lasted 60 min in this study a ph of 8 7 9 3 was used for struvite precipitation therefore it was necessary to increase the ph of reject water using sodium hydroxide a 4 m naoh solution was used the naoh solution was dosed until the set ph value was obtained and its doses were added to the reactor automatically by means of a pump installed in the system cooperating with the ph meter recovery of biogenic compounds that precipitated in insoluble salts forms and the percentage of removal of the remaining analyzed impurities total suspended solids tss ca2 and mg2 ions were calculated as the quotient of the difference in concentration

instruments ltd the mastersizer software enabled the reading of the struvite crystal size 3 results and discussion the physicochemical properties of digestates before and after the subsequent stages of treatment i e in the liquid fraction of digestates flowing into integrated technology and at the outflow from reactors in which the processes of biological ammonium ion removal deammonification and chemical precipitation of struvite respectively took place are given in table 3 the liquid fraction of digestates flowing into the integrated two stage technology was characterized by variable concentrations of phosphate phosphorus and ammonium nitrogen the concentration range varied from 18 5 to 35 8 mg l for p po4 3 and from 392 7 to 1007 0 mg l for n nh4 large variations in p po4 3 and n nh4 concentration values are also reported in the literature their concentration ranges depending on the batch components used and digestate separation technology were 30 235 mg l for p po4 3 and 460 to 3580 mg l for n nh4 40 42 concentrations of other analyzed parameters varied from 476 3 to 2165 0 mg l for tss 62 7 85 5 mg l for calcium and 25 5 46 5 mg l for magnesium ions similar concentration for magnesium and calcium in the liquid fraction of digestates were obtained by bachmann et al 43 and kolecka et al 44 after a period of sludge adaptation to the real reject water from wwtp swarzwo 21 d the efficiency of ammonium nitrogen removal in the deammonification process varied from 50 to 75 a significant problem during the operation of the deammonification reactor was the periodic inflow of leachate with very high concentrations of tss over 2000 mg l which caused a significant decrease in ammonium nitrogen removal to 10 and in the sedimentation properties of the sludge and its outflow from the reactor attempts made by the operator of the swarzewo wwtp to increase the efficiency of suspension separation during digestates dewatering on centrifuges by increasing the dose of polyelectrolytes contributed to the decrease in the tss concentration in liquid phases of digestates however a negative effect on the formation of sticking deammonification sludge granules was observed this contributed to the further higher outflow of sludge from the deammonification reactor and its inflow to the second stage of integrated technology due to the problems described above the average efficiency of the deammonification process for the entire study period was only 30 the efficiency of ammonium ion removal in the second stage of integrated technology i e in the pilot reactor for struvite precipitation varied from 13 0 to 27 0 fig 4 the obtained results do not clearly indicate a specific numerical effect of nh4 recovery potential the differences in the recovery of ammonium ions were probably due to the qualitative characteristics of the reject water in the analyzed liquid fraction of digestates the ammonium ion concentration was much higher than the magnesium and phosphate ions concentrations table 3 therefore the efficiency of ammonia removal was relatively small it was also found that by increasing reject water alkalinity ph values the efficiency of ammonium ion removal also increased fig 4 the ph value is important in converting nh4 ions to gaseous nh3 in the process of stripping ammonia during the struvite precipitation reaction celen and turker 45 and stratful et al 29 studied the effect of ph value on the efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus removal studies have shown greater nitrogen removal as ph increases with the increase of the reject water ph value the efficiency of calcium ion removal also increased the highest efficiency of ca2 removal 14 0 26 0 was found when the liquid fraction of digestates ph value ranged from 9 1 to 9 3 fig 4 when the ph values ranged from 8 7 to 9 0 the concentration of calcium ions decreased to a maximum of 11 0 in relation to the concentrations in the initial samples fig 4 therefore it can be assumed that despite maintaining he mg2 ca2 1 m ratio phosphate ions at ph 9 1 to 9 3 could be precipitated not only in the form of struvite but also as other calcium salts e g ca3 po4 2 and cahpo4 yigit and mazlum 46 and rahman et al 5 found that the presence of ca2 in a solution with a ph above 9 0 contributes to an increase in the number of impurities such as ca3 po4 2 and cahpo4 jaffer et al 47 showed that phosphorus precipitated in struvite only when the ca2 mg2 molar ratio was below 1 le corre et al 31 observed precipitation of pure struvite only when the ca2 mg2 molar ratio ranged from 0 5 to 1 0 hao et al 35 cited by rahman et al 5 found that xrd data misled the researchers into believing that the harvested crystals were struvite but in fact it was amorphous phosphorus struvite precipitation is a ph dependent reaction and pure struvite is formed at a near neutral ph from the elemental analysis of the crystals they confirmed that the highly purified 99 7 struvite was formed at ph 7 0 7 5 they also found that the struvite content decreased to around 30 70 at ph 8 0 9 0 and with a ph over 9 5 the content decreased sharply to 30 higher ph levels 10 5 resulted in the complete disappearance of struvite in the precipitates according to hermassi et al 48 the optimum ph to achieve the formation of struvite and bobierrite is approximately 9 5 and the optimum ph conditions to achieve the maximum recovery of ammonium is in the range between 4 and 8 5 as the total ammonium concentration is present in a higher concentration of nh4 however irrespective of the value of the molar quotient of mg p and ph high efficiency of phosphate removal in reject water was observed which varied from 85 0 to 93 0 fig 4 similar phosphate removal efficiency was obtained by munch and barr 28 yan and shih 11 moulessehoul et al 12 kim et al 49 kim et al 50 and quintana et al 51 the analyzed liquid fraction of digestates had a temperature of 23 28 c and according to literature reports the optimal temperature range in which struvite crystals were more effectively precipitated was in the range of 20 30 c table 2 thus it can be assumed that the observed temperature of the reject water could favor the precipitation of struvite crystals the particle size of the precipitated struvite suspension is of great importance to the struvite recovery technology design on this basis the method to separating struvite from liquids can be determined based on the granulometric analysis information on the size of the precipitated struvite particles was obtained it was observed that the crystals were of different sizes and their maximum sizes ranged from 0 72 to 1 65 mm table 4 during the research a certain trend was also observed with increasing concentration of the tss in the inflow to the second stage reactor the size of the struvite crystals decreased the largest crystal size was from 0 72 to 0 89 mm when the tss concentration was from 2 3 to 3 9 g l however when the tss concentration was more than ten times lower struvite crystal sizes were almost twice as large up to 1 65 mm the obtained test results confirmed the assumption that the presence of interfering factors suspensions may affect the dynamics of struvite precipitation and crystallization also ariyanto et al 52 are of the opinion that the presence of impurities in solution can inhibit the precipitation of struvite as well as affect the size of its crystals taddeo et al 53 determined how the presence of a suspension in the liquid fraction of digestates affects the process of struvite formation the crystallization efficiency and the presence of struvite in the precipitate were inversely proportional to the concentration of the suspension if the tss concentration in the liquid fraction of digestates was 0 8 g l the crystallization efficiency and the struvite content in the sediment were 94 and 76 respectively however when the concentration of tss in the reject water was seven times higher crystallization and the presence of struvite in the precipitate decreased they were 61 and 48 respectively despite the similar parameters of struvite precipitation values of mg p molar ratio temperature reaction time and mixing intensity researchers who tested only on synthetic wastewater observed lower sizes of struvite crystals table 4 which confirms that synthetic reject water does not reflect the quality of real reject water and the dynamics of struvite precipitation and crystallization in the analyzed real reject water may differ significantly from the results of tests with synthetic reject water high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in the liquid fraction of digestate from agricultural biogas plants is reported in the literature which are a valuable product from the point of view of the recovery of these elements the by products of fermentation e g liquid fraction of digestate may contain depending on feedstock and digestate separation technology 0 03 to 1 50 gptot l and 0 01 to 0 70 gpo4 3 l 41 53 56 the liquid fraction of digestate from agricultural biogas plants is characterized by concentrations of biogenic compounds similar to reject water from municipal wastewater treatment plants this is important because if it will be necessary to remove or recover nutrients from the liquid fraction of digestate the use of a two stage technology deammonification process struvite production process could be considered while there are many publications about phosphorus recovery from raw animal excrements or dairy industry waste only a few works concern the recovery of phosphorus from the liquid fraction of digestates 4 conclusions in the pilot study the possibility of the nutrient recovery in a two step technology for reject water treatment io deammonification iio struvite production was conducted the deammonification process io integrated technology did not interfere with the struvite precipitation course iio because the reject water after io was characterized by n p molar ratios from 1 7 to 4 5 the necessary molar ratio of these elements for struvite precipitation is 1 0 1 0 the interferences concerned the leaching of biomass from the first reactor in which the deammonification process was carried out to the second reactor in which struvite was precipitated resulting in an increase in the concentration of the suspension in the digestates the obtained results indicate the great importance of a proper digestate dewatering process with the practical possibility of struvite crystals precipitation credit

8789,the aim of this study was to assess the possibility of phosphorus and nitrogen recovery from the liquid fraction of digestates reject water pilot study using a two step technology where the precipitation of biogenic compounds in the form of magnesium ammonium phosphate struvite will be preceded by a deammonification process the tests confirmed the possibility of nutrient recovery from deammonification effluent a removal efficiency from 85 0 to 92 0 of po4 3 ions and from 13 0 to 21 0 of nh4 ions in the form of magnesium salt was achieved at a ph in the range of 8 7 9 0 however when the ph value was from 9 1 to 9 3 phosphate ions were precipitated not only as magnesium salts but also as calcium salts the maximum struvite crystal sizes ranged from 0 72 to 1 65 mm and was determined by the concentration of the suspended solids in the reject water whose presence was a factor limiting the crystallization of struvite keywords liquid fraction of digestates nitrogen and

observed this contributed to the further higher outflow of sludge from the deammonification reactor and its inflow to the second stage of integrated technology due to the problems described above the average efficiency of the deammonification process for the entire study period was only 30 the efficiency of ammonium ion removal in the second stage of integrated technology i e in the pilot reactor for struvite precipitation varied from 13 0 to 27 0 fig 4 the obtained results do not clearly indicate a specific numerical effect of nh4 recovery potential the differences in the recovery of ammonium ions were probably due to the qualitative characteristics of the reject water in the analyzed liquid fraction of digestates the ammonium ion concentration was much higher than the magnesium and phosphate ions concentrations table 3 therefore the efficiency of ammonia removal was relatively small it was also found that by increasing reject water alkalinity ph values the efficiency of ammonium ion removal also increased fig 4 the ph value is important in converting nh4 ions to gaseous nh3 in the process of stripping ammonia during the struvite precipitation reaction celen and turker 45 and stratful et al 29 studied the effect of ph value on the efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus removal studies have shown greater nitrogen removal as ph increases with the increase of the reject water ph value the efficiency of calcium ion removal also increased the highest efficiency of ca2 removal 14 0 26 0 was found when the liquid fraction of digestates ph value ranged from 9 1 to 9 3 fig 4 when the ph values ranged from 8 7 to 9 0 the concentration of calcium ions decreased to a maximum of 11 0 in relation to the concentrations in the initial samples fig 4 therefore it can be assumed that despite maintaining he mg2 ca2 1 m ratio phosphate ions at ph 9 1 to 9 3 could be precipitated not only in the form of struvite but also as other calcium salts e g ca3 po4 2 and cahpo4 yigit and mazlum 46 and rahman et al 5 found that the presence of ca2 in a solution with a ph above 9 0 contributes to an increase in the number of impurities such as ca3 po4 2 and cahpo4 jaffer et al 47 showed that phosphorus precipitated in struvite only when the ca2 mg2 molar ratio was below 1 le corre et al 31 observed precipitation of pure struvite only when the ca2 mg2 molar ratio ranged from 0 5 to 1 0 hao et al 35 cited by rahman et al 5 found that xrd data misled the researchers into believing that the harvested crystals were struvite but in fact it was amorphous phosphorus struvite precipitation is a ph dependent reaction and pure struvite is formed at a near neutral ph from the elemental analysis of the crystals they confirmed that the highly purified 99 7 struvite was formed at ph 7 0 7 5 they also found that the struvite content decreased to around 30 70 at ph 8 0 9 0 and with a ph over 9 5 the content decreased sharply to 30 higher ph levels 10 5 resulted in the complete disappearance of struvite in the precipitates according to hermassi et al 48 the optimum ph to achieve the formation of struvite and bobierrite is approximately 9 5 and the optimum ph conditions to achieve the maximum recovery of ammonium is in the range between 4 and 8 5 as the total ammonium concentration is present in a higher concentration of nh4 however irrespective of the value of the molar quotient of mg p and ph high efficiency of phosphate removal in reject water was observed which varied from 85 0 to 93 0 fig 4 similar phosphate removal efficiency was obtained by munch and barr 28 yan and shih 11 moulessehoul et al 12 kim et al 49 kim et al 50 and quintana et al 51 the analyzed liquid fraction of digestates had a temperature of 23 28 c and according to literature reports the optimal temperature range in which struvite crystals were more effectively precipitated was in the range of 20 30 c table 2 thus it can be assumed that the observed temperature of the reject water could favor the precipitation of struvite crystals the particle size of the precipitated struvite suspension is of great importance to the struvite recovery technology design on this basis the method to separating struvite from liquids can be determined based on the granulometric analysis information on the size of the precipitated struvite particles was obtained it was observed that the crystals were of different sizes and their maximum sizes ranged from 0 72 to 1 65 mm table 4 during the research a certain trend was also observed with increasing concentration of the tss in the inflow to the second stage reactor the size of the struvite crystals decreased the largest crystal size was from 0 72 to 0 89 mm when the tss concentration was from 2 3 to 3 9 g l however when the tss concentration was more than ten times lower struvite crystal sizes were almost twice as large up to 1 65 mm the obtained test results confirmed the assumption that the presence of interfering factors suspensions may affect the dynamics of struvite precipitation and crystallization also ariyanto et al 52 are of the opinion that the presence of impurities in solution can inhibit the precipitation of struvite as well as affect the size of its crystals taddeo et al 53 determined how the presence of a suspension in the liquid fraction of digestates affects the process of struvite formation the crystallization efficiency and the presence of struvite in the precipitate were inversely proportional to the concentration of the suspension if the tss concentration in the liquid fraction of digestates was 0 8 g l the crystallization efficiency and the struvite content in the sediment were 94 and 76 respectively however when the concentration of tss in the reject water was seven times higher crystallization and the presence of struvite in the precipitate decreased they were 61 and 48 respectively despite the similar parameters of struvite precipitation values of mg p molar ratio temperature reaction time and mixing intensity researchers who tested only on synthetic wastewater observed lower sizes of struvite crystals table 4 which confirms that synthetic reject water does not reflect the quality of real reject water and the dynamics of struvite precipitation and crystallization in the analyzed real reject water may differ significantly from the results of tests with synthetic reject water high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in the liquid fraction of digestate from agricultural biogas plants is reported in the literature which are a valuable product from the point of view of the recovery of these elements the by products of fermentation e g liquid fraction of digestate may contain depending on feedstock and digestate separation technology 0 03 to 1 50 gptot l and 0 01 to 0 70 gpo4 3 l 41 53 56 the liquid fraction of digestate from agricultural biogas plants is characterized by concentrations of biogenic compounds similar to reject water from municipal wastewater treatment plants this is important because if it will be necessary to remove or recover nutrients from the liquid fraction of digestate the use of a two stage technology deammonification process struvite production process could be considered while there are many publications about phosphorus recovery from raw animal excrements or dairy industry waste only a few works concern the recovery of phosphorus from the liquid fraction of digestates 4 conclusions in the pilot study the possibility of the nutrient recovery in a two step technology for reject water treatment io deammonification iio struvite production was conducted the deammonification process io integrated technology did not interfere with the struvite precipitation course iio because the reject water after io was characterized by n p molar ratios from 1 7 to 4 5 the necessary molar ratio of these elements for struvite precipitation is 1 0 1 0 the interferences concerned the leaching of biomass from the first reactor in which the deammonification process was carried out to the second reactor in which struvite was precipitated resulting in an increase in the concentration of the suspension in the digestates the obtained results indicate the great importance of a proper digestate dewatering process with the practical possibility of struvite crystals precipitation credit
