25200,mass coral bleaching has emerged in the 21st century as the greatest threat to the health of the world s reefs a sophisticated process understanding of bleaching at the polyp scale has now been achieved through laboratory and field studies but this knowledge is yet to be applied in mechanistic models of shelf scale reef systems in this study we develop a mechanistic model of the coral symbiont relationship that considers temperature mediated build up of reactive oxygen species due to excess light leading to zooxanthellae expulsion the model explicitly represents the coral host biomass as well as zooxanthellae biomass intracellular pigment concentration nutrient status and the state of reaction centres and the xanthophyll cycle photophysiological processes represented include photoadaptation xanthophyll cycle dynamics and reaction centre state transitions the mechanistic model of the coral symbiont relationship is incorporated into a 1 km resolution coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical model that encompasses the entire 2000 km length of the great barrier reef a simulation of the 2016 bleaching event shows the model is able to capture the broadscale features of the observed bleaching but fails to capture bleaching on offshore reefs due to the model s grid being unable to resolve the bathymetry of shallow platforms surrounded by deep water to further analyse the model behaviour a 200 m resolution nested simulation of davies reef 18 49 s 147 38 e is undertaken we use this nested model to demonstrate the depth gradient in zooxanthellae response to thermal stress finally we discuss the uncertainties in the bleaching model which lie primarily in quantifying the link between reactive oxygen build up and the expulsion process through the mechanistic representation of environmental forcing this model of coral bleaching applied in realistic environmental conditions has the potential to generate more detailed predictions than the presently available satellite based coral bleaching metrics and can be used to evaluate proposed management strategies keywords symbiodinium mass bleaching biogeochemical model climate change coral mortality great barrier reef 1 introduction coral bleaching is the expulsion of the unicellular zooxanthellae symbionts from the coral host often leading to mortality the link between a warming surface ocean and mass bleaching events had became obvious after the 1998 global event it was possible in 1999 to predict from climate model simulations that the thermal tolerances of reef building corals were likely to be exceeded every year within a few decades and that events as severe as the 1998 event would likely become commonplace within 20 years hoegh guldberg 1999 this 1999 prediction of an unprecedented future has eventuated in the late 2010s hughes et al 2017 thus the broadscale patterns of mass bleaching are predictable on decadal scales new management strategies under consideration for coral reef protection include prioritising those individual reefs that are more resilient to future threats hock et al 2017 thus it is urgent that we are able to identify reefs with lower thermal stress or other environmental conditions such as good water clarity that lead to greater resilience furthermore active intervention strategies are being considered that include the introduction of temperature tolerant individuals or species anthony et al 2017 van oppen et al 2017 to predict the success of these interventions requires models of coral symbiont bleaching dynamics that explicitly consider the tolerance enabling trait such as sensitivity to reactive oxygen concentration further these bleaching models must be applied in a realistic spatially resolved environmental setting to optimise deployment historically process based modelling of the coral symbiont relationship has received relatively little attention compared to other aquatic ecosystem building functional groups such as seagrass or phytoplankton e g madden and kemp 1996 baird et al 2003 this oversight is being addressed with the increasing awareness of the impacts of climate change on the coral symbiont relationship the coral symbiont relationship was first modelled using a dynamic energy budget approach muller et al 2009 eynaud et al 2011 gustafsson et al 2013 also explicitly modelled the coral symbiont relationship and included some more mechanistic process description such as diffusive limitation of nutrient uptake gustafsson et al 2014 added photo oxidative stress and in particular the xanthophyll cycle reaction centre dynamics and reactive oxygen build up to their earlier work showing that heterotrophic feeding provided protection from temperature enhanced photo oxidative stress most recently cunning et al 2017 have also shown that the balance of autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrogen sources influences the steady state of the coral symbiont system where bleached or unbleached are two final states the process based models of the coral symbiont relationship cited above have been undertaken by considering one polyp in isolation allowing comparison to laboratory experiments but the output of these one polyp simulations are not easily compared to observations from natural coral reefs a simplified form of the gustafsson et al 2013 model has been implemented in a great barrier reef gbr scale model baird et al 2016b mongin et al 2016 but the dynamics of the coral themselves in this complex biogeochemical model has only been briefly analysed herzfeld et al 2016 in order to understand the mass bleaching occurring on reefs around the world and to support a range of management actions it is necessary to apply process based coral symbiont models that consider temperature mediated light driven oxidative stress within biogeochemical ecosystem models that are capable of predicting the time varying light nutrient and prey conditions of natural reef environments a large multi agency collaboration has developed the ereefs coupled hydrodynamic sediment and biogeochemical model that simulates at multiple scales the environmental conditions of the great barrier reef schiller et al 2014 the project provides 1 and 4 km resolution hindcast and near real time simulations of hydrodynamic and biogeochemical quantities www ereefs info the models provides skilful predictions of the drivers of coral processes such as temperature spectrally resolved bottom light and water column concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients and particulate organic matter across the entire length of the great barrier reef from 2011 present skerratt et al 2018 furthermore the ereefs project includes bespoke model generation that allows high resolution models to be nested within the 1 km regional hindcast recom relocatable coastal ocean model in this paper we develop a process based model of the coral symbiont relationship that considers temperature mediated light driven oxidative stress resulting in zooxanthellae expulsion the model explicitly represents the coral host and the zooxanthellae biomass pigment concentration nutrient status as well as the reaction centre and xanthophyll cycle dynamics the process based model of the coral symbiont relationship is incorporated into the ereefs 3d coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical model of the great barrier reef and a simulation run of the 2016 bleaching event in the 1 km configuration and a 200 m davies reef configuration the model behaviour is analysed at both scales and model uncertainty discussed finally with a model that captures the impact of temperature solar radiation and water column inorganic and particulate nutrients on coral bleaching we consider future applications in the management of the great barrier reef 2 model description the ultimate purpose of the mechanistic model of coral bleaching developed in this paper is to be able to predict bleaching in natural environments and to explore the impact of interventions to reduce bleaching this requires a model that responds to water column conditions such as nutrients light and temperature and produces metrics of stress such as concentration of reactive oxygen species and zooxanthellae expulsion rates the coral symbiont model developed here is an extension of the coral polyp model of gustafsson et al 2013 and the photosystem bleaching model of gustafsson et al 2014 further we have included the photoadaption model of baird et al 2013 and the multiple nutrient limitation microalgae model of baird et al 2016b this combination of process descriptions is applied in a complex biogeochemical model of the great barrier reef that has been described elsewhere mongin et al 2016 and was developed in the ereefs project schiller et al 2014 the following description of the coral symbiont model is split into three sections 1 the interactions between the coral host the symbiont and the environment 2 photoadaptation through pigment synthesis and the xanthophyll cycle and 3 photosynthesis reaction centre dynamics and reactive oxygen production leading to zooxanthellae expulsion 2 1 coral host symbiont and the environment the state variables for the coral polyp model table a 1 include the biomass of coral tissue ch g n m 2 and the structurial material of the zooxanthellae cells cs mg n m 2 the structurial material of the zooxanthellae cs in addition to nitrogen contains carbon and phosphorus at the redfield ratio the zooxanthellae cells also contain reserves of nitrogen r n mg n m 2 phosphorus r p mg p m 2 and carbon r c mg c m 2 the zooxanthellae light absorption capability is resolved by considering the time varying concentrations of pigments chlorophyll a chl diadinoxanthin x p and diatoxanthin x h for which the state variable represents the areal concentration a further three pigments chlorophyll c 2 peridinin and β carotene are considered in the absorption calculations but their concentrations are in fixed ratios to chlorophyll a exchanges between the coral community and the overlying water can alter the water column concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon dic nitrogen n and phosphorus p as well as particulate phytoplankton b zooplankton z and detritus d where multiple nitrogen plankton and detritus types are resolved table a 1 the coral host is able to assimilate organic nitrogen either through translocation from the zooxanthellae cells or through the capture of water column organic detritus and or plankton fig 1 the zooxanthellae varies its intracellular pigment content depending on potential light limitation of growth and the incremental benefit of adding pigment allowing for the package effect baird et al 2013 the coral tissue is assumed to have a redfield c n p stoichiometry redfield et al 1963 as shown by muller parker et al 1994 the zooxanthellae are modelled with variable c n p ratios muller parker et al 1994 based on a structurial material at the redfield ratio but with variable internal reserves the fluxes of c n and p with the overlying water column nutrient uptake and detritial mucus release can therefore vary from the redfield ratio an explanation of the individual processes follows with tables in appendix listing all the model state variables table a 1 derived variables table a 2 equations tables a 3 a 4 a 5 a 6 and parameters values tables a 7 and a 8 2 1 1 effective projected area fraction of corals a key component of the coral symbiont model is to relate the biomass of the polyp to coral cover the fraction of the bottom covered when viewed from above this relationship is important as it determines for a given biomass of coral host the area of the bottom the polyp covers the bottom cover impacts on the nutrient flux from the water column and limits the number of zooxanthellae per unit area following the derivation of baird et al 2016a we use a mathematical form that captures the likelihood that an independently placed polyp will lie over the top of another polyp and is similar to a poisson distribution 1 a eff 1 exp ω ch c h where a eff is the effective projected area fraction of the coral community m2 m 2 ch is the biomass of the coral host and ω ch is the nitrogen specific polyp area coefficient m2 g n 1 in the coarser configurations coral communities are restricted to a size that is often much less than the model grid size due to their existence on the rims of reefs baird et al 2004b to consider this sub grid scale patchiness eq 1 is slightly modified resulting in the effective projected area for corals calculated by 2 a eff a c h 1 exp ω ch c h a c h the area coefficient a ch represents the fraction of a grid cell that the corals can occupy in the case of 200 m grids this will be up to 1 representing dense corals on the whole cell for coarser grids a ch is reduced to represent that the cell contains both dense coral communities on the forereef reef crest and also sparse coral communities on the reef flat lagoon areas in the 1 km grid a ch represents the fraction of the area of dense corals to total reef area and is of order 0 36 the geometrically derived equation for a ch is given by fig 2 3 a ch 1 r x 2 r 2 r h 1 h 2 π r x where x is the width of dense coral communities on the reef and r is the equivalent circular radius of the grid cell the impact of concentrating corals into one portion of a grid cell as quantified by a ch only affects the calculations when the concentrated area begins self shading thus in eq 2 when ω ch ch a ch is small a eff 1 exp ω ch ch but if ω ch ch a ch 1 and a ch 1 the coral biomass saturates due to space limitation at a lower biomass than it would for a ch 1 the ereefs model contains macroalgae that grow above the corals at the seabed for the case of macroalgae over growing corals the effective projected area occupied by corals is further reduced by the presence of macroalgal leaves 4 a eff a ch exp ω ma m a 1 exp ω ch c h a ch where ma is the biomass of macroalgae and ω ma is the nitrogen specific leaf area coefficient m2 g n 1 we assume that the fraction of the bottom covered by the macroalgae exp ω ma ma is evenly spread across the surface thus the portion covered by corals is also reduced by the same factor resulting in the multiplication of the exp ω ma ma and a c h 1 exp ω c h c h a c h in eq 4 in the ereefs biogeochemical model the macroalgae is parameterised more like a filamentous epiphytic macroalgae rather than a leafy seaweed larger seaweeds including halimeda beds that are extensive in t 1 he northern gbr mcneil et al 2016 may exclude the corals or seagrasses via a different mechanisms than captured in eq 4 but are not represented in the model 2 1 2 growth rate of zooxanthellae the model considers the diffusion limited supply of dissolved inorganic nutrients n and p and the absorption of light delivering n p and fixed c to the internal reserves of the cell fig 1 nitrogen and phosphorus are taken directly into the reserves but carbon is first fixed through photosynthesis kirk 1994 5 106 co 2 212 h 2 o 1060 photons 106 ch 2 o 106 h 2 o 138 o 2 more on eq 5 is derived in section 2 2 2 the internal reserves of c n and p are consumed to form structural material at the redfield ratio redfield et al 1963 6 106 ch 2 o 16 no 3 po 4 3 16 h 2 o 19 h 1060 photons ch 2 o 106 nh 3 16 h 3 po 4 note that while oxygen balances across the two equations the oxygen released from no 3 in eq 6 appears as a product in the photosynthesis equation eq 5 ignoring this small mismatch in time of oxygen production simplifies the model equations while maintaining oxygen conservation the growth rate of zooxanthellae is given by the maximum growth rate μ max multiplied by the normalised reserves r of each of n p and c 7 μ μ max r n r p r c fig 3 is a simple schematic showing the impact of growth alone on internal reserves for a population of two cells growing into exactly three cells although the equations are continuous in time for a population the mass of the reserves and therefore the total c n p chl a ratio of the cell depends on the interaction of the supply and consumption rates when consumption exceeds supply and the supply rates are non redfield the normalised internal reserves of the non limiting nutrients approach 1 while the limiting nutrient becomes depleted thus the model behaves like a law of the minimum growth model except during fast changes in nutrient supply rates the molar ratio of a cell including both structural material and reserves is given by 8 c n p 106 1 r c 16 1 r n 1 r p 2 1 3 uptake of nutrients and particulate matter from the overlying water the maximum flux of nutrients and prey to the surface of the coral is specified as a mass transfer limit per projected area of coral atkinson and bilger 1992 baird et al 2004b as given by falter et al 2004 zhang et al 2011 9 s x 2850 2 τ ρ 0 38 sc x 0 6 sc x ν d x where s x is the mass transfer rate coefficient of element x n p τ is the shear stress on the bottom ρ is the density of water and scx is the schmidt number the schmidt number is the ratio of the diffusivity of momentum ν and mass d x and varies with temperature salinity and nutrient species the mass transfer rate constant s x can be thought of as the height of water cleared of nutrient per unit of time by the water coral exchange the capture of organic particles phytoplankton zooplankton labile detritus is also represented as an areal flux ribes and atkinson 2007 considered whether mass transfer limits apply to particulate matter on reefs and found for coral rubble communities only a weak velocity dependence suggesting filter feeders overcame any diffusion limitations see also monismith et al 2010 thus instead of using a velocity dependent mass transfer rate like was used for dissolved tracers eq 9 capture of organic particles g is represented by a constant mass transfer rate coefficient s part multiplied by the sum of the concentration of each of organic constituents in the water column the calculated capture rate is limited to the maximum growth rate of the coral tissue μ ch max c h table a 4 the maximum fluxes of both nutrients and particulates from the overlying water are multiplied by the effective projected area fraction of the coral a eff to account for corals covering only a fraction of the bottom 2 1 4 translocation between zooxanthellae and coral host translocation here represents the one way consumption of zooxanthellae organic matter produced through either zooxanthellae growth or mortality a fraction f tran of zooxanthellae growth is translocated to the coral tissue this fraction is given by the ratio of the projected area of the zooxanthellae cells to twice the surface area of the coral polyp 2chω ch 10 f tran π r cs 2 c s m n 2 c h ω ch where r cs is the radius of the zooxanthellae cells when f tran 0 5 zooxanthellae growth is primarily used for increasing symbiont population and for f tran 0 5 it is primarily translocated the initial number of symbiont cells is set so that π r cs 2 cs m n 2 ch ω ch is less than 1 under this initial condition as π r cs 2 cs m n 2 ch ω ch approaches 1 all symbiont growth is translocated so f tran never has a value above 1 this translocation formulation represents a geometrically derived space limitation on zooxanthellae being located within two layers of gastrodermal cells gustafsson et al 2013 the geometric derivation has avoided the need for uncertain and or poorly defined mass specific space limitation coefficients 2 1 5 coral polyp net production coral host biomass ch grows at a maximum rate μ c h m a x c h conditional on the availability of organic matter either taken up from the water column as particulate organic matter by the host itself eq 9 or through translocation from zooxanthellae it is assumed that the realised hetertrophic feeding rate of zooxanthellae g is independent of the physiology of the coral host and further that the fraction of the zooxanthellae growth that is translocated depends only on the unavailability of space for the zooxanthellae population to reside in see above 11 g min min μ ch max c h f tran μ cs cs ζ cs c s 0 g should this rate of translocation plus the flux of organic matter due to zooxanthellae mortality exceed the maximum growth rate of coral host biomass μ ch max c h then the coral host grows at its maximum rate and the excess is released into the environment as mucus should the translocation rate and the particulate organic matter flux be less than μ ch max c h then the coral host grows at the sum of the two finally should the sum of the translocation rate and the particulate organic matter flux be greater than μ ch max c h then the host will use all of the translocated organic matter and a fraction of captured particulate organic matter with the fraction being composed of fractions of each particulate components based on the relative concentration of organic matter in each category 2 1 6 non bleaching mortality of coral polyps there are two mortality terms the mortality of the entire polyp ζ ch affecting both coral and zooxanthellae biomass and mortality of the zooxanthellae ζ cs the polyp mortality term has a quadratic mortality coefficient ζ ch that stabilises the biomass of coral tissue to μ ch ζ ch for a maximum growth rate of coral μ ch max 0 05 d 1 ζ ch has been set to 0 01 g n m 2 1 d 1 so the biomass of coral tissue ch stabilises at 0 05 0 01 5 g n m 2 as this biomass is per unit area and includes a correction for corals being only viable on a eff of the area ζ ch needs to be divided by a eff in the equations the model does not consider coral host mortality due to thermal stress directly the impact of zooxanthellae expulsion on the host is a reduced translocation of organic matter from the symbiont to the host reducing growth if heterotrophic feeding is growth limiting 2 2 photoadaptation through pigment synthesis and the xanthophyll cycle the model considers the photoacclimation or photoadaptation of the zooxanthellae cells through the processes of pigment synthesis and xanthophyll pigment cycling fig 4 left the model assumes a constant ratio of xanthophyll pigments to chlorophyll a θ chl2xan this ratio is maintained constant through time by assuming xanthophyll synthesis is θ chl2xan multiplied by the chlorophyll a synthesis for simplicity we assume all synthesised xanthophyll is of the photosynthesising form similarly a constant ratio of synthesis of peridinin chlorophyll c 2 and β carotene accessory pigments to chlorophyll a ensures these accessory pigments also maintain a constant ratio the de coupling of zooxanthellae growth and pigment synthesis results in a variable carbon to chlorophyll ratio through time the rate of synthesis of pigment is based on the incremental benefit of adding pigment to the rate of photosynthesis this calculation includes a reduced benefit when carbon reserves are replete 1 r c the reduced benefit due to self shading χ and the fraction of inhibited reaction centres q in q t the factor χ is calculated for the derivative of the absorption cross section per unit projected area α pa with non dimensional group ρ γ c i r for a sphere of radius r baird et al 2013 12 1 pa α ρ 1 e 2 ρ 2 ρ 2 2 ρ 1 ρ 3 χ where χ represents the area specific incremental rate of change of absorption with ρ for the multi spectral calculation used in this paper we calculate the quantum weighted mean of χ χ the rate of chlorophyll a synthesis is given by 13 c i t k chl max 1 r c 1 q in q t χ if c chl a θ min where k chl max is the maximum rate of synthesis and θ min is the minimum c chl ratio below θ min pigment synthesis is zero both self shading and the rate of photosynthesis itself are based on photon absorption rather than energy absorption as experimentally shown in microalgae nielsen and sakshaug 1993 2 2 1 xanthophyll cycle the symbiont cell contains six pigments chlorophyll a chlorophyll c 2 peridinin β carotene and diadinoxanthin that absorb light and pass the photons on through the photosystem and diatoxanthin that absorbs light and dissipates it as heat diadinoxanthin and diatoxanthin are almost identical molecules diatoxanthin is the de epoxidised form of diadinoxanthin the xanthophyll cycle falkowski and raven 2007 is the reversible switching of diadinoxanthin to diatoxanthin under potentially damaging excess light and vice versa under light limiting conditions the xanthophyll cycle in the model is represented by two state variables the areal concentration of diadinoxanthin x p and of diatoxanthin x h and requires one new parameter τ xan the time scale of switching the rate at which the xanthophyll pigments switch from diadinoxanthin to diatoxanthin or vice versa is assumed to be relatively fast when compared to the synthesis of pigments the reversible processes is given by 14 x p t 8 q in q t 0 5 3 τ xan φ x p x h x h t where the time scale 1 τ xan is order of 10 minutes gustafsson et al 2014 the direction of switching in eq 14 is set by the term q in q t 0 5 3 such that cells with a large fraction of inhibited reaction centres q in q t 0 5 switch from diadinoxanthin x p to diatoxanthin x h and a small fraction of oxidised reaction centres vice versa the term 8 q in q t 0 5 3 also increases cubically from zero to 1 for q in q t 0 5 or decreases from zero to 1 for q in q t 0 5 as the cell becomes more or less inhibited respectively using a cubic power that takes a small value in the vicinity of 0 5 prevents fast switching between diadinoxanthin x p and diatoxanthin x h in the region of 0 5 the constant 8 arises from 8 0 53 1 where 3 is the cubic power a odd power is necessary to retain the direction of switching the final bracketed term x p x h recognises that the switching is quantified for the population of cells and so is proportional to the total xanthophyll pigment concentration of the population finally the rate of conversion slows as one pigment pool is reduced to zero as determined by a parabolic term φ eq 15 if q in q t 0 5 and x h x p i e uninhibited reaction centres with more heat dissipating than light absorbing pigment or q in q t 0 5 and x p x h i e inhibited reaction centres with more light absorbing than heat dissipating pigment then φ 1 and the rate of switching is independent of the present mix of heat and light absorbing pigment otherwise a parabolic form for φ is used to reduce the rate of switching as the processes completes 15 φ 1 4 x p x p x h 0 5 2 the parabola is at a maximum at x p x h but decreases by the square of the difference between the fraction of diadinoxanthin x p and 0 5 the square ensures that the fractional term does not change the overall sign of the switching which as already mentioned is set by the reaction centre status i e 8 q in q t 0 5 3 the value of the parabolic term is zero at x p x h at x p x h or x p x h the parabolic term is equal to 0 25 the parabolic term is multiplied by 4 so that when switching is complete φ 1 1 0 thus preventing x p or x h either exceeding x p x h or becoming negative in summary the full switching term eq 14 results in the relatively quick switching of the xanthophyll pigments between light absorbing and heat dissipating based on the oxidation status of the reaction centres the processes of light absorption by diadinoxanthin chlorophyll a chlorophyll c 2 peridinin and β carotene is called photochemical quenching pq while light absorbed and dissipated by diatoxanthin x h is called non photochemical quenching npq a common measure of pq is 1 fv fm raven 1997 where fv is the difference between maximum fluorescence fm and minimum fluorescence i e variable fluorescence fv fm is a measurable ratio that represents the maximum potential quantum efficiency of photosystem ii if all capable reaction centres are open which is equivalent in this model to q ox q t 2 2 2 carbon fixation respiration when photons are captured by oxidised reaction centres photosynthesis there an increase in the cellular reserves of carbon r c and an accompanying uptake of dissolved inorganic carbon 106 1060 12 k i q ox q t a q ox 1 r c and release of oxygen per cell 138 1060 32 k i q ox q t a q ox 1 r c to the water column table a 3 while the reserves of nutrients have been defined generically above a quantity of n p taken up but not yet combined at the redfield ratio the reserves of carbon are a generic photosynthate they represent the point at which a photon has been absorbed and its energy used to produce fixed carbon and release oxygen basal respiration represents a constant cost of cell maintenance the loss of internal reserves μ cs max m c ϕ r c results in a gain of water column dissolved inorganic carbon per cell 106 1060 12 14 μ cs max ϕ r c as well as a loss in water column dissolved oxygen per cell 138 1060 32 14 μ cs max ϕ r c table a 3 the loss in water column dissolved oxygen per cell represents an instantaneous respiration of the fixed carbon of the reserves basal respiration decreases internal reserves and therefore growth rate but does not directly lead to cell mortality at zero carbon reserves implicit in this scheme is that the basal cost is higher when the cell has more carbon reserves r c a linear mortality term resulting in the loss of structural material and carbon reserves is considered below 2 3 photosynthesis reaction centre dynamics and reactive oxygen production to model the processes of photoinhibition we include a submodel of reaction centre dynamics that captures the fate of photons absorbed by the cell as a changing oxidation state of the reaction centre of photosystem ii psii the model contains state variables for the concentration of oxidised reaction centre q ox reduced reaction centre concentration q red and inhibited reaction centre concentration q in as well as the concentration of reactive oxygen species ros fig 4 the reaction centre dynamics is based on stoichiometric relationships between reaction centre numbers photons absorbed and the rate of generation of reactive oxygen species to follow the path of a photon as it moves through the reaction centres fig 4 photons are absorbed by either a photosynthetic pigment or a heat dissipating pigment in the ratio of the concentration of the two pigment types if the photon is absorbed by a heat dissipating pigment it is lost if the photon is absorbed by a photosynthetic pigment then it will result in a change in either the internal reserves of carbon the reaction centre state or the concentration of reactive oxygen species like absorption by pigments the photons interact with the reaction centres as a proportion of the total number of reaction centres if the photon encounters an oxidised reaction centre the reserves are deplete and the rubisco enzyme active then the only change will be an increase in carbon reserves i e carbon fixation if the photon encounters an oxidised reaction centre but fixation is inhibited then an oxidised reaction centre becomes reduced if the photon hits a reduced reaction centre then a reduced reaction centre becomes inhibited the final alternative if the photon interactions with an inhibited reaction centre then the reaction centre remains inhibited and a reactive oxygen species is generated adding to the reactive oxygen pool the following sections derives rates for these pathways 2 3 1 light absorption

γ car o the component of light absorbed by oxidised reaction centres and therefore available for carbon fixation is 19 k i fix k i q ox q t a q ox 1 r c where the oxidised fraction of reaction centres is q ox q t and the fixation rate can be limited by the carbon reserves 1 r c if the carbon reserves are full r c approaches 1 then fixation does not consume photons carbon fixation is also reduced by the temperature inhibition of the active component of the reaction centres this is the key term in coral bleaching the mechanism through which this occurs is understood to be the inactivation of the ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco lilley et al 2010 field observations show bleaching occurs relative to the climatological value for each reef site liu et al 2014 suggesting a mechanism for corals to adapt to local conditions for practical purposes we propose the following equation for the temperature dependent inhibition of carbon fixation 20 a q ox 1 exp 2 δ t 1 exp 2 where δt is the temperature anomaly and is calculated as the difference between the model bottom temperature and the spatially and temporally varying climatological temperature at that depth ridgway and dunn 2003 the form of eq 20 was based on a general line of reasoning that bleaching stress begins at a temperature anomaly of 1 c the noaa bleaching index uses 1 c above climatology that would reduce a q ox in eq 20 to 0 73 and that for a sustained period 2 summer months 2 c equivalent to 16 degree heating weeks causes maximal stress a q ox 0 if the climatological temperature is below 26 c then δt is given by the model bottom temperature minus 26 c the constant 2 c represents the temperature anomaly above which activity of oxidised reaction centres is zero for δt 0 c a q ox 1 and all oxidised reaction centres are active and δt 2 c a q ox 0 and all oxidised reaction centres are inactive both the constant 2 c and the use of a seasonally varying seabed climatological temperature which is based on all available but nonetheless limited number of in situ observations and interpolated onto a coarse 0 5 grid are key uncertainties worth consideration in future work the component of total absorption that is absorbed by oxidised reaction centres but not used in fixation and therefore responsible for moving reaction centres from an oxidised to reduced state is the remaining light absorbed at the oxidised centres 21 k i unfix k i q ox q t k i fix photons are absorbed by the reaction centres in each of the three oxidation states in proportion to the fraction in each state independent of the carbon reserves absorption of a photon by an oxidised state is discussed above absorption by a reduced state moves it to an inhibited state absorption by an inhibited state does not change the state but produces ros see below 22 q ox t k i n m rcii q ox q t 1 a q ox 1 r c 23 q red t k i n m rcii q ox q t 1 a q ox 1 r c k i n m rcii q red q t 24 q in t k i n m rcii q red q t where k i is the rate of photon absorption eq 16 n is the number of zooxanthellae cells and m rcii is a stoichiometric coefficient and is one over the number of photons needed to reduce a whole reaction centre table a 8 the reaction centre turn over time is shorter than the chlorophyll synthesis or carbon fixation terms to illustrate this point suggett et al 2008 gives the cross sectional area of an individual reaction centre as 385 10 20 m2 thus for a photon flux of 250 mol photon m 2 d 1 a relatively low light level for midday the time interval between individual photon interceptions is 385 10 20 250 a v 1 86400 0 1 s as this turnover is much quicker than other processes represented in the photosystem model it has the potential to slow the model integration a solution is to divide the terms in eqs 23 25 by 106 this results in reaction centre dynamics varying on an hourly rather than second time scale the slower response of the reaction centres has only small feedbacks to other terms in the photosystem model and maintains conservation of reaction centre numbers in the calculation 2 3 2 production of reactive oxygen photons absorbed by inhibited reaction centres generate reactive

reactions centres is difficult to quantify and may be a function of temperature hill et al 2011 we took the assumption that the reaction centres would need to be able to repair damaged caused by 10 mol photon m 2 d 1 this relatively low daily averaged light intensity represents a threshold below which surface adapted coral species show an impact due to low light and might therefore be a

oxygen species are reduced through a temperature dependent processes hill et al 2011 27 ros t f t r n r p r c ros where f t is a function of temperature and here is set at the maximum growth rate of the zooxanthellae cells this particularly uncertain assumption results in the cells detoxifying at the same rate as they grow the logic for this term is as simple as a healthier symbiont is one that grows faster and coincidently would have more resources for detoxification 2 4 zooxanthellae expulsion the rate of expulsion of zooxanthellae cells is function of the reactive oxygen concentration ros

davies reef configuration the 200 m model of davies reef off townsville centred on 18 49 s 147 38 e andrews and gentien 1982 was built using the ereefs project recom automatic nesting capability https research csiro au ereefs models models about recom the model bathymetry was interpolated from the gbr100 bathymetry beaman 2010 version 4 with improved resolution of reef tops atmospheric forcing was the same as the 1 km model above the initial conditions of water column state variables are interpolated from a previous run of the 1 km model gbr1 h2p0 b1p9 chyd dhnd while some benthic variables seagrass and coral distributions have distributions re interpolated from the high resolution benthic maps and assigned values from the nearest neighbour in the initialising model the 200 m nested model uses boundary conditions provided by a standard ereefs 1 km model simulation gbr1 h2p0 b1p9 chyd dhnd that did not include coral bleaching thus the model that generated the boundary conditions for the nested model is slightly different to the 1 km configuration described above but the water column properties that are advected into the nested model which depend primarily on nutrient plankton processes in the water column will be very similar the boundary condition for all water column tracers was formulated using the advection scheme van leer 1977 used within the model domain itself this consistency of boundary and advection schemes ensures diffusion and dispersion errors are minimised 3 results the coral bleaching model presented in this paper details new formulations for the processes of zooxanthellae growth as a function of the interaction of nutrient and light uptake photoadaption through the pigment synthesis and xanthophyll cycling photoinhibition through reaction centre dynamics and zooxanthellae expulsion through a build up of reactive oxygen species here we describe the model behaviour in a 1 km configuration along the entire great barrier reef during a mass bleaching event in early 2016 in a 200 m nested model of davies reef and finally at the scale of one polyp through analysing a time series at two depths in the davies reef model 3 1 gbr scale behaviour of the zooxanthellae model the 2016 bleaching event was the most severe experienced by the great barrier reef with the greatest bleaching occurring in the far north hughes et al 2017 this extreme event provides a good test of the model on january 1 the simulated water temperature at the coral surface was only just above the summer monthly maximum as shown by the simulated rubisco activity being close to 1 i e not inhibited by thermal stress fig 7 left by february 1 the temperature relative to climatology had increased significantly and did not reduce until after april 1 the response in concentration of reactive oxygen on january 1 fig 8 shows zooxanthellae on some shallow reefs had relatively high levels of oxidative stress by february 1 most of the reefs north of hinchinbook island shows high levels of reactive oxygen although interestingly this reduced somewhat by march 1 the model predicted reactive oxygen stress has a similar spatial distribution as the observed bleaching from aerial surveys fig 8 bottom left with the exception that the model bathymetry is too deep at most of the offshore reefs to accumulate oxidative stress while these results are promising they illustrate that for the purposes of predicting coral bleaching the 1 km model suffers from poor resolution of many of the outer reef reef tops 3 2 individual davies reef scale behaviour davies reef is a 4 km 2 km kidney shaped reef located off townsville fig 9 in the 1 km model described above davies consists of approximately 8 grid cells with a minimum depth of 15 m below mean sea level in the 200 m nested model which can resolve reef tops far better the minimum depth is 3 8 m this allows for a much greater spatial variation in light at the seabed fig 9 photosynthetically available radiation par other environmental variables such as temperature din dip and particulate organic matter pom also show variation across the reef as the fast moving overlying waters are altered by fluxes with the benthos focusing on the diurnal change at 6 am all xanthophyll pigments are photoabsorbing and the reaction centres are primarily oxidised fig 9 the nitrogen assimilation by corals is dominated by organic nitrogen uptake i e heterotrophic feeding which in the model is only allowed in dark conditions by 3 pm most xanthophyll pigments have switched to heat dissipating with the exception of those below 20 m that remain photoabsorbing the reaction centres in shallow waters have become strongly inhibited although again at depth remain primarily oxidised interestingly the reserves of c n and p as well as the reactive oxygen concentration remain relatively constant through the day this is because the growth of zooxanthellae is relatively slow so the reserves are not being depleted quickly as the reactive oxygen concentration is relatively constant the bleaching rate is only moderately stronger during the day bleaching is occurring only in waters less than 10 m the temperature mediated inactivity of rubisco a q ox is more evenly spread across the reef thus the reduced bleaching below 10 m is due to lower light levels rather than less thermal stress fig 10 3 3 polyp scale behaviour of the zooxanthellae model analysis of time series at two depths in the davies reef nested configuration can be used to further investigate the behaviour of the coral bleaching model we have chosen two adjacent sites one shallow and one deep fig 9 depth panel here we are looking at the physiological response of the zooxanthellae photosystem to different light levels under thermal stress fig 11 3 3 1 zooxanthellae growth limitation zooxanthellae growth is a function of the maximum growth rate and the reserves of nitrogen phosphorus and carbon each normalised reserve r is a value between zero and one the normalised reserved increases when the supply of the nutrient exceeds the consumption for growth and decreases when consumption for growth exceeds the nutrient supply baird et al 2003 in coral reef environments nutrients are generally strongly limiting in the surface waters and less so at depth one exception to this generality is if rubisco becomes inactive at high temperatures and then absorption does not add to carbon reserves and growth can become limited by fixed carbon at the shallow site fig 11a carbon reserves are high 0 7 phosphorus reserves intermediate 0 6 and nitrogen reserves low 0 1 thus growth is strongly n limited high carbon reserves can be maintained in part because rubisco is moderately active a q ox 0 5 fig 11b although on the 3rd march the carbon reserves can be seen to drop when rubisco became inactive for 24 h fig 11b at the deep site fig 11d we see that the carbon reserves are also high and the zooxanthellae are still nitrogen limited this is possible because of the clear water bottom light is only halved from the 3 8 m site and because of photoacclimation described in next section 3 3 2 zooxanthellae photoacclimation photoacclimation occurs through changing rates of pigment synthesis and xanthophyll pigment switching pigment synthesis at the shallow site the cells adjust to high light by reducing pigment synthesis resulting in a high c chl ratio of 100 g g fig 11b a high c chl ratio is a low cellular chlorophyll concentration at the deep site the c chl is reduced to 40 g g as chlorophyll synthesis is greater to capture a higher percentage of the photons that are hitting the cells xanthophyll cycle at the shallow site the reaction centres are inactive during the day with recovery over night fig 11c as a result the xanthophyll cycle is primarily in the heat dissipating state during the day and light absorbing in the early morning in contrast at the deeper site fig 11f a greater fraction of the reaction centres are oxidised and therefore the xanthophyll pigments are all in the photosynthesising state the photoacclimation processes are able to keep the carbon reserves to a relatively similar level at the two sites despite light levels varying from 8 to 80 mol photon m 2 d 1 this is in part due to impact of nitrogen limitation on the other reserves 3 3 3 reactive oxygen accumulation and bleaching the rate of ros build up depends on both the fraction of inhibited reaction centres and the flux of photons to the reaction centres thus at the deep site the reactive oxygen concentration is low and the bleaching rate is zero fig 11f in contrast at the shallow site there was a substantial fraction of inactive reaction centres fig 11c and a large photon flux so reactive oxygen concentration builds up at the shallow site in early march when rubisco became totally inactive more photons hit inactive reaction centres and there was an even greater accumulation of ros leading to more zooxanthellae expulsion fig 11c 4 discussion in this paper we have introduced new formulations of coral host symbiont interactions photoadaptation xanthophyll cycling and reactive oxygen dynamics outputs of a simulation at the gbr wide scale show promise for predicting mass bleaching events and the behaviour at the scale of davies reef appear reasonable at this point in the model development components of the model derivation are uncertain and the laboratory and field data sets to assess the model outputs are still emerging nonetheless this represents the first application of a sophisticated coral bleaching model applied across a entire shelf system 4 1 model formulation the coral symbiont model presented here is derived from process representations that take advantage where possible of geometric or physical constraints the geometric descriptions used include 1 a relationship between polyp biomass and coral cover derived from a random placement geometric model eq 2 2 the limiting term for zooxanthellae self shading based on the derivative of the absorption cross section against absorption of the pigments eq 12 3 the uptake of dissolved nutrients through a diffusive boundary layer eq 9 and 4 the space limitation of zooxanthellae using zooxanthellae projected areas in a two layer gastrodermal cell anatomy eq 10 one advantage of this geometric approach is that it often requires fewer and better constrained parameters than empirical process descriptions this approach has proven successful in other marine biogeochemical applications baird et al 2004a wild allen et al 2013 and is fundamental to the formulation of the ereefs biogeochemical model baird et al 2016b the process descriptions also take advantage of stoichiometric relationships between reaction centre numbers photons absorbed and the concentration of reactive oxygen species created it is a unique characteristic of the ereefs biogeochemical water column optical model baird et al 2016b that the processes of absorption by photoautotrophs are photon conserving such that the photosynthetic growth processes in phytoplankton and benthic plants are a function of stoichiometric combination of photons and nitrogen and phosphorus baird et al 2001 this approach is also applied in zooxanthellae with the absorption coefficient of the multiple pigments determining the number of photons absorbed and then this quantity reduces reaction centres or accumulates carbon or reactive oxygen in stoichiometrically determined ratios by using these constraints the model is able to resolve reaction centre state fig 4 and include the processes of photoinhibition and reactive oxygen generation with the inclusion of just a few new model parameters such as the stoichiometric ratio of rcii units to photons m rcii and a few temperature dependent reaction rates we openly recognise that we do not have the knowledge to follow all processes mechanistically thus the inactivation of the rubisco mediated carbon fixation eq 20 the repair rate of inhibited reaction centres eq 26 and the detoxification rate of reactive oxygen species eq 27 are temperature dependent empirical formulations for which the underlying biochemical reactions are not resolved additionally the reactive oxygen concentration that initiates bleaching ros threshold and the mathematical form of the expulsion above this threshold eq 28 are based on simple reasoning emerging laboratory techniques murphy et al 2017 may provide the quantitative understanding necessary to formulate more mechanistic process descriptions the descriptions of ros dynamics that are empirically formulated are the characteristics that would be considered unique for temperature tolerant corals bay et al 2016 and thus those that may determine the resilience of reefs in the future matz et al 2018 as these uncertainties are fundamental to some management strategies being considered anthony et al 2017 it is urgent that modellers use the emerging understanding of the processes driving ros toxicity as it becomes available there is also considerable uncertainty of the role of all pigments in the electron chain fujiki and taguchi 2001 propose that the photosynthetic xanthophyll pigment diadinoxanthin does not pass photons onto chlorophyll a while other works suggest photosynthetic xanthophylls do drive carbon fixation falkowski and raven 2007 in this paper we provide a path from diadinoxanthin absorption to carbon fixation fig 4 other detailed structural studies show that the morphology of the pigment bed changes with physiological status liu et al 2004 thus potentially changing the roles of pigments the challenge of including knowledge from detailed biochemical studies like these is formidable and is not attempted here even in the cases where physical constraints are used in the model formulation there is uncertainty regarding their form for example the model presented here uses sphere packing geometry in a two layer gastrodermal cell anatomy to determine the translocation fraction of zooxanthellae growth eq 10 another study van woesik et al 2010 for example considers layers of cells stacked vertically with the light intensity of lower layers limiting zooxanthellae density while it may be possible to choose the most appropriate mechanistic formulation for a particular coral species the task of choosing a generic form as we have attempted here inevitably has shortcomings the model developed here does not consider all phenomena relevant to bleaching for example the model considers only one mechanism for thermal stress induced bleaching while the existence of bleaching under low light conditions demonstrates that other mechanisms exist tolleter et al 2013 further only one generic coral type and one symbiodinium clade is considered thus the simulation here is not able to resolve the differences between temperature tolerances of different corals assemblages bay et al 2016 finally the ereefs biogeochemical model baird et al 2016b that incorporates the new zooxanthellae photophysiological processes derived in this paper represents only a fraction of the processes affecting coral health for example the model represents only one coral type and one macroalgae type and considers the only interaction between the two is a competition for nutrients and light a more sophisticated ecosystem or habitat style model would consider multiple coral and seagrass types inhabiting particular niches on the seabed and interacting with a range of herbivorous fish bozec et al 2018 such an improved representation of coral mortality which could include other processes such as cyclone damage and starfish grazing babcock et al 2016 would remove the need for the ad hoc quadratic mortality term for coral hosts despite all the simplifications and omissions the model developed here does represent a comprehensive set of processes spanning scales from the polyp processes to the shelf scale and from nutrient and photochemical interactions to coral symbiosis 4 2 future applications the use of satellite derived temperature exposure alone as a measure of coral bleaching severity has been broadly successful liu et al 2014 and is used operationally at a global scale nonetheless it has not captured all bleaching events accurately and work is under way to include solar radiation in bleaching algorithms skirving et al 2018 even with additional considerations such as solar radiation satellite algorithms will always be limited to the estimation of near surface properties and their inability to consider factors affecting bleaching such as dissolved nutrients d angelo and wiedenmann 2014 that cannot be remotely sensed furthermore satellite observations will never be predictive thus the near real time prediction and forecasting of coral bleaching by a biogeochemical model such as developed here that can consider the history of temperature light and other environmental conditions at the surface of the corals provides a means to overcome some of these limitations finally a process based model is capable of explicitly representing management strategies such as local shading coelho et al 2017 marine cloud brightening or increased stress tolerance of individuals and or populations of coral or zooxanthellae anthony et al 2017 the ereefs modelling framework has already been used to optimise catchment management for the purposes of improving water quality on the great barrier reef brodie et al 2017 the bleaching model derived here will next be used to quantify the impact of interventions designed to minimise the impacts of a warming ocean on the corals of the great barrier reef acknowledgements the coral

25200,mass coral bleaching has emerged in the 21st century as the greatest threat to the health of the world s reefs a sophisticated process understanding of bleaching at the polyp scale has now been achieved through laboratory and field studies but this knowledge is yet to be applied in mechanistic models of shelf scale reef systems in this study we develop a mechanistic model of the coral symbiont relationship that considers temperature mediated build up of reactive oxygen species due to excess light leading to zooxanthellae expulsion the model explicitly represents the coral host biomass as well as zooxanthellae biomass intracellular pigment concentration nutrient status and the state of reaction centres and the xanthophyll cycle photophysiological processes represented include photoadaptation xanthophyll cycle dynamics and reaction centre state transitions the mechanistic model of the coral symbiont relationship is incorporated into a 1 km resolution coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical model that encompasses the entire 2000 km length of the great barrier reef a simulation of the 2016 bleaching event shows the model is able to capture the broadscale features of the observed bleaching but fails to capture bleaching on offshore reefs due to the model s grid being unable to resolve the bathymetry of shallow platforms surrounded by deep water to further analyse the model behaviour a 200 m resolution nested simulation of davies reef 18 49 s 147 38 e is undertaken we use this nested model to demonstrate the depth gradient in zooxanthellae response to thermal stress finally we discuss the uncertainties in the bleaching model which lie primarily in quantifying the link between reactive oxygen build up and the expulsion process through the mechanistic representation of environmental forcing this model of coral bleaching applied in realistic environmental conditions has the potential to generate more detailed predictions than the presently available satellite based coral bleaching metrics and can be used to evaluate proposed management strategies keywords symbiodinium mass bleaching biogeochemical model climate change coral mortality great barrier reef 1 introduction coral bleaching is the expulsion of the unicellular zooxanthellae symbionts from the coral host often leading to mortality the link between a warming surface ocean and mass bleaching events had became obvious after the 1998 global event it was possible in 1999 to predict from climate model simulations that the thermal tolerances of reef building corals were likely to be exceeded every year within a few decades and that events as severe as the 1998 event would likely become commonplace within 20 years hoegh guldberg 1999 this 1999 prediction of an unprecedented future has eventuated in the late 2010s hughes et al 2017 thus the broadscale patterns of mass bleaching are predictable on decadal scales new management strategies under consideration for coral reef protection include prioritising those individual reefs that are more resilient to future threats hock et al 2017 thus it is urgent that we are able to identify reefs with lower thermal stress or other environmental conditions such as good water clarity that lead to greater resilience furthermore active intervention strategies are being considered that include the introduction of temperature tolerant individuals or species anthony et al 2017 van oppen et al 2017 to predict the success of these interventions requires models of coral symbiont bleaching dynamics that explicitly consider the tolerance enabling trait such as sensitivity to reactive oxygen concentration further these bleaching models must be applied in a realistic spatially resolved environmental setting to optimise deployment historically process based modelling of the coral symbiont relationship has received relatively little attention compared to other aquatic ecosystem building functional groups such as seagrass or phytoplankton e g madden and kemp 1996 baird et al 2003 this oversight is being addressed with the increasing awareness of the impacts of climate change on the coral symbiont relationship the coral symbiont relationship was first modelled using a dynamic energy budget approach muller et al 2009 eynaud et al 2011 gustafsson et al 2013 also explicitly modelled the coral symbiont relationship and included some more mechanistic process description such as diffusive limitation of nutrient uptake gustafsson et al 2014 added photo oxidative stress and in particular the xanthophyll cycle reaction centre dynamics and reactive oxygen build up to their earlier work showing that heterotrophic feeding provided protection from temperature enhanced photo oxidative stress most recently cunning et al 2017 have also shown that the balance of autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrogen sources influences the steady state of the coral symbiont system where bleached or unbleached are two final states the process based models of the coral symbiont relationship cited above have been undertaken by considering one polyp in isolation allowing comparison to laboratory experiments but the output of these one polyp simulations are not easily compared to observations from natural coral reefs a simplified form of the gustafsson et al 2013 model has been implemented in a great barrier reef gbr scale model baird et al 2016b mongin et al 2016 but the dynamics of the coral themselves in this complex biogeochemical model has only been briefly analysed herzfeld et al 2016 in order to understand the mass bleaching occurring on reefs around the world and to support a range of management actions it is necessary to apply process based coral symbiont models that consider temperature mediated light driven oxidative stress within biogeochemical ecosystem models that are capable of predicting the time varying light nutrient and prey conditions of natural reef environments a large multi agency collaboration has developed the ereefs coupled hydrodynamic sediment and biogeochemical model that simulates at multiple scales the environmental conditions of the great barrier reef schiller et al 2014 the project provides 1 and 4 km resolution hindcast and near real time simulations of hydrodynamic and biogeochemical quantities www ereefs info the models provides skilful predictions of the drivers of coral processes such as temperature spectrally resolved bottom light and water column concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients and particulate organic matter across the entire length of the great barrier reef from 2011 present skerratt et al 2018 furthermore the ereefs project includes bespoke model generation that allows high resolution models to be nested within the 1 km regional hindcast recom relocatable coastal ocean model in this paper we develop a process based model of the coral symbiont relationship that considers temperature mediated light driven oxidative stress resulting in zooxanthellae expulsion the model explicitly represents the coral host and the zooxanthellae biomass pigment concentration nutrient status as well as the reaction centre and xanthophyll cycle dynamics the process based model of the coral symbiont relationship is incorporated into the ereefs 3d coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical model of the great barrier reef and a simulation run of the 2016 bleaching event in the 1 km configuration and a 200 m davies reef configuration the model behaviour is analysed at both scales and model uncertainty discussed finally with a model that captures the impact of temperature solar radiation and water column inorganic and particulate nutrients on coral bleaching we consider future applications in the management of the great barrier reef 2 model description the ultimate purpose of the mechanistic model of coral bleaching developed in this paper is to be able to predict bleaching in natural environments and to explore the impact of interventions to reduce bleaching this requires a model that responds to water column conditions such as nutrients light and temperature and produces metrics of stress such as concentration of reactive oxygen species and zooxanthellae expulsion rates the coral symbiont model developed here is an extension of the coral polyp model of gustafsson et al 2013 and the photosystem bleaching model of gustafsson et al 2014 further we have included the photoadaption model of baird et al 2013 and the multiple nutrient limitation microalgae model of baird et al 2016b this combination of process descriptions is applied in a complex biogeochemical model of the great barrier reef that has been described elsewhere mongin et al 2016 and was developed in the ereefs project schiller et al 2014 the following description of the coral symbiont model is split into three sections 1 the interactions between the coral host the symbiont and the environment 2 photoadaptation through pigment synthesis and the xanthophyll cycle and 3 photosynthesis reaction centre dynamics and reactive oxygen production leading to zooxanthellae expulsion 2 1 coral host symbiont and the environment the state variables for the coral polyp model table a 1 include the biomass of coral tissue ch g n m 2 and the structurial material of the zooxanthellae cells cs mg n m 2 the structurial material of the zooxanthellae cs in addition to nitrogen contains carbon and phosphorus at the redfield ratio the zooxanthellae cells also contain reserves of nitrogen r n mg n m 2 phosphorus r p mg p m 2 and carbon r c mg c m 2 the zooxanthellae light absorption capability is resolved by considering the time varying concentrations of pigments chlorophyll a chl diadinoxanthin x p and diatoxanthin x h for which the state variable represents the areal concentration a further three pigments chlorophyll c 2 peridinin and β carotene are considered in the absorption calculations but their concentrations are in fixed ratios to chlorophyll a exchanges between the coral community and the overlying water can alter the water column concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon dic nitrogen n and phosphorus p as well as particulate phytoplankton b zooplankton z and detritus d where multiple nitrogen plankton and detritus types are resolved table a 1 the coral host is able to assimilate organic nitrogen either through translocation from the zooxanthellae cells or through the capture of water column organic detritus and or plankton fig 1 the zooxanthellae varies its intracellular pigment content depending on potential light limitation of growth and the incremental benefit of adding pigment allowing for the package effect baird et al 2013 the coral tissue is assumed to have a redfield c n p stoichiometry redfield et al 1963 as shown by muller parker et al 1994 the zooxanthellae are modelled with variable c n p ratios muller parker et al 1994 based on a structurial material at the redfield ratio but with variable internal reserves the fluxes of c n and p with the overlying water column nutrient uptake and detritial mucus release can therefore vary from the redfield ratio an explanation of the individual processes follows with tables in appendix listing all the model state variables table a 1 derived variables table a 2 equations tables a 3 a 4 a 5 a 6 and parameters values tables a 7 and a 8 2 1 1 effective projected area fraction of corals a key component of the coral symbiont model is to relate the biomass of the polyp to coral cover the fraction of the bottom covered when viewed from above this relationship is important as it determines for a given biomass of coral host the area of the bottom the polyp covers the bottom cover impacts on the nutrient flux from the water column and limits the number of zooxanthellae per unit area following the derivation of baird et al 2016a we use a mathematical form that captures the likelihood that an independently placed polyp will lie over the top of another polyp and is similar to a poisson distribution 1 a eff 1 exp ω ch c h where a eff is the effective projected area fraction of the coral community m2 m 2 ch is the biomass of the coral host and ω ch is the nitrogen specific polyp area coefficient m2 g n 1 in the coarser configurations coral communities are restricted to a size that is often much less than the model grid size due to their existence on the rims of reefs baird et al 2004b to consider this sub grid scale patchiness eq 1 is slightly modified resulting in the effective projected area for corals calculated by 2 a eff a c h 1 exp ω ch c h a c h the area coefficient a ch represents the fraction of a grid cell that the corals can occupy in the case of 200 m grids this will be up to 1 representing dense corals on the whole cell for coarser grids a ch is reduced to represent that the cell contains both dense coral communities on the forereef reef crest and also sparse coral communities on the reef flat lagoon areas in the 1 km grid a ch represents the fraction of the area of dense corals to total reef area and is of order 0 36 the geometrically derived equation for a ch is given by fig 2 3 a ch 1 r x 2 r 2 r h 1 h 2 π r x where x is the width of dense coral communities on the reef and r is the equivalent circular radius of the grid cell the impact of concentrating corals into one portion of a grid cell as quantified by a ch only affects the calculations when the concentrated area begins self shading thus in eq 2 when ω ch ch a ch is small a eff 1 exp ω ch ch but if ω ch ch a ch 1 and a ch 1 the coral biomass saturates due to space limitation at a lower biomass than it would for a ch 1 the ereefs model contains macroalgae that grow above the corals at the seabed for the case of macroalgae over growing corals the effective projected area occupied by corals is further reduced by the presence of macroalgal leaves 4 a eff a ch exp ω ma m a 1 exp ω ch c h a ch where ma is the biomass of macroalgae and ω ma is the nitrogen specific leaf area coefficient m2 g n 1 we assume that the fraction of the bottom covered by the macroalgae exp ω ma ma is evenly spread across the surface thus the portion covered by corals is also reduced by the same factor resulting in the multiplication of the exp ω ma ma and a c h 1 exp ω c h c h a c h in eq 4 in the ereefs biogeochemical model the macroalgae is parameterised more like a filamentous epiphytic macroalgae rather than a leafy seaweed larger seaweeds including halimeda beds that are extensive in t 1 he northern gbr mcneil et al 2016 may exclude the corals or seagrasses via a different mechanisms than captured in eq 4 but are not represented in the model 2 1 2 growth rate of zooxanthellae the model considers the diffusion limited supply of dissolved inorganic nutrients n and p and the absorption of light delivering n p and fixed c to the internal reserves of the cell fig 1 nitrogen and phosphorus are taken directly into the reserves but carbon is first fixed through photosynthesis kirk 1994 5 106 co 2 212 h 2 o 1060 photons 106 ch 2 o 106 h 2 o 138 o 2

ignoring this small mismatch in time of oxygen production simplifies the model equations while maintaining oxygen conservation the growth rate of zooxanthellae is given by the maximum growth rate μ max multiplied by the normalised reserves r of each of n p and c 7 μ μ max r n r p r c fig 3 is a simple schematic showing the impact of growth alone on internal reserves for a population of two cells growing into exactly three cells although the equations are continuous in time for a population the mass of the reserves and therefore the total c n p chl a ratio of the cell depends on the interaction of the supply and consumption rates when consumption exceeds supply and the supply rates are non redfield the normalised internal reserves of the non limiting nutrients approach 1 while the limiting nutrient becomes depleted thus the model behaves like a law of the minimum growth model except during fast changes in nutrient supply rates the molar ratio of a cell including both structural material and reserves is given by 8 c n p 106 1 r c 16 1 r n 1 r p 2 1 3 uptake of nutrients and particulate matter from the overlying water the maximum flux of nutrients and prey to the surface of the coral is specified as a mass transfer limit per projected area of coral atkinson and bilger 1992 baird et al 2004b as given by falter et al 2004 zhang et al 2011 9 s x 2850 2 τ ρ 0 38 sc x 0 6 sc x ν d x where s x is the mass transfer rate coefficient of element x n p τ is the shear stress on the bottom ρ is the density of water and scx is the schmidt number the schmidt number is the ratio of the diffusivity of momentum ν and mass d x and varies with temperature salinity and nutrient species the mass transfer rate constant s x can be thought of as the height of water cleared of nutrient per unit of time by the water coral exchange the capture of organic particles phytoplankton zooplankton labile detritus is also represented as an areal flux ribes and atkinson 2007 considered whether mass transfer limits apply to particulate matter on reefs and found for coral rubble communities only a weak velocity dependence suggesting filter feeders overcame any diffusion limitations see also monismith et al 2010 thus instead of using a velocity dependent mass transfer rate like was used for dissolved tracers eq 9 capture of organic particles g is represented by a constant mass transfer rate coefficient s part multiplied by the sum of the concentration of each of organic constituents in the water column the calculated capture rate is limited to the maximum growth rate of the coral tissue μ ch max c h table a 4 the maximum fluxes of both nutrients and particulates from the overlying water are multiplied by the effective projected area fraction of the coral a eff to account for corals covering only a fraction of the bottom 2 1 4 translocation between zooxanthellae and coral host translocation here represents the one way consumption of zooxanthellae organic matter produced through either zooxanthellae growth or mortality a fraction f tran of zooxanthellae growth is translocated to the coral tissue this fraction is given by the ratio of the projected area of the zooxanthellae cells to twice the surface area of the coral polyp 2chω ch 10 f tran π r cs 2 c s m n 2 c h ω ch where r cs is the radius of the zooxanthellae cells when f tran 0 5 zooxanthellae growth is primarily used for increasing symbiont population and for f tran 0 5 it is primarily translocated the initial number of symbiont cells is set so that π r cs 2 cs m n 2 ch ω ch is less than 1 under this initial condition as π r cs 2 cs m n 2 ch ω ch approaches 1 all symbiont growth is translocated so f tran never has a value above 1 this translocation formulation represents a geometrically derived space limitation on zooxanthellae being located within two layers of gastrodermal cells gustafsson et al 2013 the geometric derivation has avoided the need for uncertain and or poorly defined mass specific space limitation coefficients 2 1 5 coral polyp net production coral host biomass ch grows at a maximum rate μ c h m a x c h conditional on the availability of organic matter either taken up from the water column as particulate organic matter by the host itself eq 9 or through translocation from zooxanthellae it is assumed that the realised hetertrophic feeding rate of zooxanthellae g is independent of the physiology of the coral host and further that the fraction of the zooxanthellae growth that is translocated depends only on the unavailability of space for the zooxanthellae population to reside in see above 11 g min min μ ch max c h f tran μ cs cs ζ cs c s 0 g should this rate of translocation plus the flux of organic matter due to zooxanthellae mortality exceed the maximum growth rate of coral host biomass μ ch max c h then the coral host grows at its maximum rate and the excess is released into the environment as mucus should the translocation rate and the particulate organic matter flux be less than μ ch max c h then the coral host grows at the sum of the two finally should the sum of the translocation rate and the particulate organic matter flux be greater than μ ch max c h then the host will use all of the translocated organic matter and a fraction of captured particulate organic matter with the fraction being composed of fractions of each particulate components based on the relative concentration of organic matter in each category 2 1 6 non bleaching mortality of coral polyps there are two mortality terms the mortality of the entire polyp ζ ch affecting both coral and zooxanthellae biomass and mortality of the zooxanthellae ζ cs the polyp mortality term has a quadratic mortality coefficient ζ ch that stabilises the biomass of coral tissue to μ ch ζ ch for a maximum growth rate of coral μ ch max 0 05 d 1 ζ ch has been set to 0 01 g n m 2 1 d 1 so the biomass of coral tissue ch stabilises at 0 05 0 01 5 g n m 2 as this biomass is per unit area and includes a correction for corals being only viable on a eff of the area ζ ch needs to be divided by a eff in the equations the model does not consider coral host mortality due to thermal stress directly the impact of zooxanthellae expulsion on the host is a reduced translocation of organic matter from the symbiont to the host reducing growth if heterotrophic feeding is growth limiting 2 2 photoadaptation through pigment synthesis and the xanthophyll cycle the model considers the photoacclimation or photoadaptation of the zooxanthellae cells through the processes of pigment synthesis and xanthophyll pigment cycling fig 4 left the model assumes a constant ratio of xanthophyll pigments to chlorophyll a θ chl2xan this ratio is maintained constant through time by assuming xanthophyll synthesis is θ chl2xan multiplied by the chlorophyll a synthesis for simplicity we assume all synthesised xanthophyll is of the photosynthesising form similarly a constant ratio of synthesis of peridinin chlorophyll c 2 and β carotene accessory pigments to chlorophyll a ensures these accessory pigments also maintain a constant ratio the de coupling of zooxanthellae growth and pigment synthesis results in a variable carbon to chlorophyll ratio through time the rate of synthesis of pigment is based on the incremental benefit of adding pigment to the rate of photosynthesis this calculation includes a reduced benefit when carbon reserves are replete 1 r c the reduced benefit due to self shading χ and the fraction of inhibited reaction centres q in q t the factor χ is calculated for the derivative of the absorption cross section per unit projected area α pa with non dimensional group ρ γ c i r for a sphere of radius r baird et al 2013 12 1 pa α ρ 1 e 2 ρ 2 ρ 2 2 ρ 1 ρ 3 χ where χ represents the area specific incremental rate of change of absorption with ρ for the multi spectral calculation used in this paper we calculate the quantum weighted mean of χ χ the rate of chlorophyll a synthesis is given by 13 c i t k chl max 1 r c 1 q in q t χ if c chl a θ min where k chl max is the maximum rate of synthesis and θ min is the minimum c chl ratio below θ min pigment synthesis is zero both self shading and the rate of photosynthesis itself are based on photon absorption rather than energy absorption as experimentally shown in microalgae nielsen and sakshaug 1993 2 2 1 xanthophyll cycle the symbiont cell contains six pigments chlorophyll a chlorophyll c 2 peridinin β carotene and diadinoxanthin that absorb light and pass the photons on through the photosystem and diatoxanthin that absorbs light and dissipates it as heat diadinoxanthin and diatoxanthin are almost identical molecules diatoxanthin is the de epoxidised form of diadinoxanthin the xanthophyll cycle falkowski and raven 2007 is the reversible switching of diadinoxanthin to diatoxanthin under potentially damaging excess light and vice versa under light limiting conditions the xanthophyll cycle in the model is represented by two state variables the areal concentration of diadinoxanthin x p and of diatoxanthin x h and requires one new parameter τ xan the time scale of switching the rate at which the xanthophyll pigments switch from diadinoxanthin to diatoxanthin or vice versa is assumed to be relatively fast when compared to the synthesis of pigments the reversible processes is given by 14 x p t 8 q in q t 0 5 3 τ xan φ x p x h x h t where the time scale 1 τ xan is order of 10 minutes gustafsson et al 2014 the direction of switching in eq 14 is set by the term q in q t 0 5 3 such that cells with a large fraction of inhibited reaction centres q in q t 0 5 switch from diadinoxanthin x p to diatoxanthin x h and a small fraction of oxidised reaction centres vice versa the term 8 q in q t 0 5 3 also increases cubically from zero to 1 for q in q t 0 5 or decreases from zero to 1 for q in q t 0 5 as the cell becomes more or less inhibited respectively using a cubic power that takes a small value in the vicinity of 0 5 prevents fast switching between diadinoxanthin x p and diatoxanthin x h in the region of 0 5 the constant 8 arises from 8 0 53 1 where 3 is the cubic power a odd power is necessary to retain the direction of switching the final bracketed term x p x h recognises that the switching is quantified for the population of cells and so is proportional to the total xanthophyll pigment concentration of the population finally the rate of conversion slows as one pigment pool is reduced to zero as determined by a parabolic term φ eq 15 if q in q t 0 5 and x h x p i e uninhibited reaction centres with more heat dissipating than light absorbing pigment or q in q t 0 5 and x p x h i e inhibited reaction centres with more light absorbing than heat dissipating pigment then φ 1 and the rate of switching is independent of the present mix of heat and light absorbing pigment otherwise a parabolic form for φ is used to reduce the rate of switching as the processes completes 15 φ 1 4 x p x p x h 0 5 2 the parabola is at a maximum at x p x h but decreases by the square of the difference between the fraction of diadinoxanthin x p and 0 5 the square ensures that the fractional term does not change the overall sign of the switching which as already mentioned is set by the reaction centre status i e 8 q in q t 0 5 3 the value of the parabolic term is zero at x p x h at x p x h or x p x h the parabolic term is equal to 0 25 the parabolic term is multiplied by 4 so that when switching is complete φ 1 1 0 thus preventing x p or x h either exceeding x p x h or becoming negative in summary the full switching term eq 14 results in the relatively quick switching of the xanthophyll pigments between light absorbing and heat dissipating based on the oxidation status of the reaction centres the processes of light absorption by diadinoxanthin chlorophyll a chlorophyll c 2 peridinin and β carotene is called photochemical quenching pq while light absorbed and dissipated by diatoxanthin x h is called non photochemical quenching npq a common measure of pq is 1 fv fm raven 1997 where fv is the difference between maximum fluorescence fm and minimum fluorescence i e variable fluorescence fv fm is a measurable ratio that represents the maximum potential quantum efficiency of photosystem ii if all capable reaction centres are open which is equivalent in this model to q ox q t 2 2 2 carbon fixation respiration when photons are captured by oxidised reaction centres photosynthesis there an increase in the cellular reserves of carbon r c and an accompanying uptake of dissolved inorganic carbon 106 1060 12 k i q ox q t a q ox 1 r c and release of oxygen per cell 138 1060 32 k i q ox q t a q ox 1 r c to the water column table a 3 while the reserves of nutrients have been defined generically above a quantity of n p taken up but not yet combined at the redfield ratio the reserves of carbon are a generic photosynthate they represent the point at which a photon has been absorbed and its energy used to produce fixed carbon and release oxygen basal respiration represents a constant cost of cell maintenance the loss of internal reserves μ cs max m c ϕ r c results in a gain of water column dissolved inorganic carbon per cell 106 1060 12 14 μ cs max ϕ r c as well as a loss in water column dissolved oxygen per cell 138 1060 32 14 μ cs max ϕ r c table a 3 the loss in water column dissolved oxygen per cell represents an instantaneous respiration of the fixed carbon of the reserves basal respiration decreases internal reserves and therefore growth rate but does not directly lead to cell mortality at zero carbon reserves implicit in this scheme is that the basal cost is higher when the cell has more carbon reserves r c a linear mortality term resulting in the loss of structural material and carbon reserves is considered below 2 3 photosynthesis reaction centre dynamics and reactive oxygen production to model the processes of photoinhibition we include a submodel of reaction centre dynamics that captures the fate of photons absorbed by the cell as a changing oxidation state of the reaction centre of photosystem ii psii the model contains state variables for the concentration of oxidised reaction centre q ox reduced reaction centre concentration q red and inhibited reaction centre concentration q in as well as the concentration of reactive oxygen species ros fig 4 the reaction centre dynamics is based on stoichiometric relationships between reaction centre numbers photons absorbed and the rate of generation of reactive oxygen species to follow the path of a photon as it moves through the reaction centres fig 4 photons are absorbed by either a photosynthetic pigment or a heat dissipating pigment in the ratio of the concentration of the two pigment types if the photon is absorbed by a heat dissipating pigment it is lost if the photon is absorbed by a photosynthetic pigment then it will result in a change in either the internal reserves of carbon the reaction centre state or the concentration of reactive oxygen species like absorption by pigments the photons interact with the reaction centres as a proportion of the total number of reaction centres if the photon encounters an oxidised reaction centre the reserves are deplete and the rubisco enzyme active then the only change will be an increase in carbon reserves i e carbon fixation if the photon encounters an oxidised reaction centre but fixation is inhibited then an oxidised reaction centre becomes reduced if the photon hits a reduced reaction centre then a reduced reaction centre becomes inhibited the final alternative if the photon interactions with an inhibited reaction centre then the reaction centre remains inhibited and a reactive oxygen species is generated adding to the reactive oxygen pool the following sections derives rates for these pathways 2 3 1 light absorption

γ car o the component of light absorbed by oxidised reaction centres and therefore available for carbon fixation is 19 k i fix k i q ox q t a q ox 1 r c where the oxidised fraction of reaction centres is q ox q t and the fixation rate can be limited by the carbon reserves 1 r c if the carbon reserves are full r c approaches 1 then fixation does not consume photons carbon fixation is also reduced by the temperature inhibition of the active component of the reaction centres this is the key term in coral bleaching the mechanism through which this occurs is understood to be the inactivation of the ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco lilley et al 2010 field observations show bleaching occurs relative to the climatological value for each reef site liu et al 2014 suggesting a mechanism for corals to adapt to local conditions for practical purposes we propose the following equation for the temperature dependent inhibition of carbon fixation 20 a q ox 1 exp 2 δ t 1 exp 2 where δt is the temperature anomaly and is calculated as the difference between the model bottom temperature and the spatially and temporally varying climatological temperature at that depth ridgway and dunn 2003 the form of eq 20 was based on a general line of reasoning that bleaching stress begins at a temperature anomaly of 1 c the noaa bleaching index uses 1 c above climatology that would reduce a q ox in eq 20 to 0 73 and that for a sustained period 2 summer months 2 c equivalent to 16 degree heating weeks causes maximal stress a q ox 0 if the climatological temperature is below 26 c then δt is given by the model bottom temperature minus 26 c the constant 2 c represents the temperature anomaly above which activity of oxidised reaction centres is zero for δt 0 c a q ox 1 and all oxidised reaction centres are active and δt 2 c a q ox 0 and all oxidised reaction centres are inactive both the constant 2 c and the use of a seasonally varying seabed climatological temperature which is based on all available but nonetheless limited number of in situ observations and interpolated onto a coarse 0 5 grid are key uncertainties worth consideration in future work the component of total absorption that is absorbed by oxidised reaction centres but not used in fixation and therefore responsible for moving reaction centres from an oxidised to reduced state is the remaining light absorbed at the oxidised centres 21 k i unfix k i q ox q t k i fix photons are absorbed by the reaction centres in each of the three oxidation states in proportion to the fraction in each state independent of the carbon reserves absorption of a photon by an oxidised state is discussed above absorption by a reduced state moves it to an inhibited state absorption by an inhibited state does not change the state but produces ros see below 22 q ox t k i n m rcii q ox q t 1 a q ox 1 r c 23 q red t k i n m rcii q ox q t 1 a q ox 1 r c k i n m rcii q red q t 24 q in t k i n m rcii q red q t where k i is the rate of photon absorption eq 16 n is the number of zooxanthellae cells and m rcii is a stoichiometric coefficient and is one over the number of photons needed to reduce a whole reaction centre table a 8 the reaction centre turn over time is shorter than the chlorophyll synthesis or carbon fixation terms to illustrate this point suggett et al 2008 gives the cross sectional area of an individual reaction centre as 385 10 20 m2 thus for a photon flux of 250 mol photon m 2 d 1 a relatively low light level for midday the time interval between individual photon interceptions is 385 10 20 250 a v 1 86400 0 1 s as this turnover is much quicker than other processes represented in the photosystem model it has the potential to slow the model integration a solution is to divide the terms in eqs 23 25 by 106 this results in reaction centre dynamics varying on an hourly rather than second time scale the slower response of the reaction centres has only small feedbacks to other terms in the photosystem model and maintains conservation of reaction centre numbers in the calculation 2 3 2 production of reactive oxygen photons absorbed by inhibited reaction centres generate reactive

reactions centres is difficult to quantify and may be a function of temperature hill et al 2011 we took the assumption that the reaction centres would need to be able to repair damaged caused by 10 mol photon m 2 d 1 this relatively low daily averaged light intensity represents a threshold below which surface adapted coral species show an impact due to low light and might therefore be a reasonable minimum repair rate as discussed later this is one of the most uncertain components of the model to repair damaged caused by 10 mol photon m 2 d 1 26 q in t 268 m rcii q in q ox t where m rcii is a stoichiometric coefficient mol photon mol reaction centre 1 and the constant 268 arises from the 10 mol photon m 2 d 1 limit 2 3 4 rate of detoxification of reactive oxygen species reactive oxygen species are reduced through a temperature dependent processes hill et al 2011 27 ros t f t r n r p r c ros where f t is a function of temperature and here is set at the maximum growth rate of the zooxanthellae cells this particularly uncertain assumption results in the cells detoxifying at the same rate as they grow the logic for this term is as simple as a healthier symbiont is one that grows faster and coincidently would have more resources for detoxification 2 4 zooxanthellae expulsion the rate of expulsion of zooxanthellae cells is function of the reactive oxygen concentration ros 28 c s t max γ ros ros threshold m o c s where γ is the maximum expulsion rate m o 138 16 32 14 m n is the stoichiometric coefficient for the oxygen content of the structural component of a cell and rosthreshold is the limit below which no bleaching occurs a similar rate of loss is applied to q ox q red q in chl x p x h r c r n r p and ros expulsion leads to an increase in detritus at the redfield ratio d red in the bottom water column layer from the zooxanthellae structural material and an increased in dissolved nutrients carbon dic nitrogen in the form of ammonia nh 4 and phosphorus

davies reef configuration the 200 m model of davies reef off townsville centred on 18 49 s 147 38 e andrews and gentien 1982 was built using the ereefs project recom automatic nesting capability https research csiro au ereefs models models about recom the model bathymetry was interpolated from the gbr100 bathymetry beaman 2010 version 4 with improved resolution of reef tops atmospheric forcing was the same as the 1 km model above the initial conditions of water column state variables are interpolated from a previous run of the 1 km model gbr1 h2p0 b1p9 chyd dhnd while some benthic variables seagrass and coral distributions have distributions re interpolated from the high resolution benthic maps and assigned values from the nearest neighbour in the initialising model the 200 m nested model uses boundary conditions provided by a standard ereefs 1 km model simulation gbr1 h2p0 b1p9 chyd dhnd that did not include coral bleaching thus the model that generated the boundary conditions for the nested model is slightly different to the 1 km configuration described above but the water column properties that are advected into the nested model which depend primarily on nutrient plankton processes in the water column will be very similar the boundary condition for all water column tracers was formulated using the advection scheme van leer 1977 used within the model domain itself this consistency of boundary and advection schemes ensures diffusion and dispersion errors are minimised 3 results the coral bleaching model presented in this paper details new formulations for the processes of zooxanthellae growth as a function of the interaction of nutrient and light uptake photoadaption through the pigment synthesis and xanthophyll cycling photoinhibition through reaction centre dynamics and zooxanthellae expulsion through a build up of reactive oxygen species here we describe the model behaviour in a 1 km configuration along the entire great barrier reef during a mass bleaching event in early 2016 in a 200 m nested model of davies reef and finally at the scale of one polyp through analysing a time series at two depths in the davies reef model 3 1 gbr scale behaviour of the zooxanthellae model the 2016 bleaching event was the most severe experienced by the great barrier reef with the greatest bleaching occurring in the far north hughes et al 2017 this extreme event provides a good test of the model on january 1 the simulated water temperature at the coral surface was only just above the summer monthly maximum as shown by the simulated rubisco activity being close to 1 i e not inhibited by thermal stress fig 7 left by february 1 the temperature relative to climatology had increased significantly and did not reduce until after april 1 the response in concentration of reactive oxygen on january 1 fig 8 shows zooxanthellae on some shallow reefs had relatively high levels of oxidative stress by february 1 most of the reefs north of hinchinbook island shows high levels of reactive oxygen although interestingly this reduced somewhat by march 1 the model predicted reactive oxygen stress has a similar spatial distribution as the observed bleaching from aerial surveys fig 8 bottom left with the exception that the model bathymetry is too deep at most of the offshore reefs to accumulate oxidative stress while these results are promising they illustrate that for the purposes of predicting coral bleaching the 1 km model suffers from poor resolution of many of the outer reef reef tops 3 2 individual davies reef scale behaviour davies reef is a 4 km 2 km kidney shaped reef located off townsville fig 9 in the 1 km model described above davies consists of approximately 8 grid cells with a minimum depth of 15 m below mean sea level in the 200 m nested model which can resolve reef tops far better the minimum depth is 3 8 m this allows for a much greater spatial variation in light at the seabed fig 9 photosynthetically available radiation par other environmental variables such as temperature din dip and particulate organic matter pom also show variation across the reef as the fast moving overlying waters are altered by fluxes with the benthos focusing on the diurnal change at 6 am all xanthophyll pigments are photoabsorbing and the reaction centres are primarily oxidised fig 9 the nitrogen assimilation by corals is dominated by organic nitrogen uptake i e heterotrophic feeding which in the model is only allowed in dark conditions by 3 pm most xanthophyll pigments have switched to heat dissipating with the exception of those below 20 m that remain photoabsorbing the reaction centres in shallow waters have become strongly inhibited although again at depth remain primarily oxidised interestingly the reserves of c n and p as well as the reactive oxygen concentration remain relatively constant through the day this is because the growth of zooxanthellae is relatively slow so the reserves are not being depleted quickly as the reactive oxygen concentration is relatively constant the bleaching rate is only moderately stronger during the day bleaching is occurring only in waters less than 10 m the temperature mediated inactivity of rubisco a q ox is more evenly spread across the reef thus the reduced bleaching below 10 m is due to lower light levels rather than less thermal stress fig 10 3 3 polyp scale behaviour of the zooxanthellae model analysis of time series at two depths in the davies reef nested configuration can be used to further investigate the behaviour of the coral bleaching model we have chosen two adjacent sites one shallow and one deep fig 9 depth panel here we are looking at the physiological response of the zooxanthellae photosystem to different light levels under thermal stress fig 11 3 3 1 zooxanthellae growth limitation zooxanthellae growth is a function of the maximum growth rate and the reserves of nitrogen phosphorus and carbon each normalised reserve r is a value between zero and one the normalised reserved increases when the supply of the nutrient exceeds the consumption for growth and decreases when consumption for growth exceeds the nutrient supply baird et al 2003 in coral reef environments nutrients are generally strongly limiting in the surface waters and less so at depth one exception to this generality is if rubisco becomes inactive at high temperatures and then absorption does not add to carbon reserves and growth can become limited by fixed carbon at the shallow site fig 11a carbon reserves are high 0 7 phosphorus reserves intermediate 0 6 and nitrogen reserves low 0 1 thus growth is strongly n limited high carbon reserves can be maintained in part because rubisco is moderately active a q ox 0 5 fig 11b although on the 3rd march the carbon reserves can be seen to drop when rubisco became inactive for 24 h fig 11b at the deep site fig 11d we see that the carbon reserves are also high and the zooxanthellae are still nitrogen limited this is possible because of the clear water bottom light is only halved from the 3 8 m site and because of photoacclimation described in next section 3 3 2 zooxanthellae photoacclimation photoacclimation occurs through changing rates of pigment synthesis and xanthophyll pigment switching pigment synthesis at the shallow site the cells adjust to high light by reducing pigment synthesis resulting in a high c chl ratio of 100 g g fig 11b a high c chl ratio is a low cellular chlorophyll concentration at the deep site the c chl is reduced to 40 g g as chlorophyll synthesis is greater to capture a higher percentage of the photons that are hitting the cells xanthophyll cycle at the shallow site the reaction centres are inactive during the day with recovery over night fig 11c as a result the xanthophyll cycle is primarily in the heat dissipating state during the day and light absorbing in the early morning in contrast at the deeper site fig 11f a greater fraction of the reaction centres are oxidised and therefore the xanthophyll pigments are all in the photosynthesising state the photoacclimation processes are able to keep the carbon reserves to a relatively similar level at the two sites despite light levels varying from 8 to 80 mol photon m 2 d 1 this is in part due to impact of nitrogen limitation on the other reserves 3 3 3 reactive oxygen accumulation and bleaching the rate of ros build up depends on both the fraction of inhibited reaction centres and the flux of photons to the reaction centres thus at the deep site the reactive oxygen concentration is low and the bleaching rate is zero fig 11f in contrast at the shallow site there was a substantial fraction of inactive reaction centres fig 11c and a large photon flux so reactive oxygen concentration builds up at the shallow site in early march when rubisco became totally inactive more photons hit inactive reaction centres and there was an even greater accumulation of ros leading to more zooxanthellae expulsion fig 11c 4 discussion in this paper we have introduced new formulations of coral host symbiont interactions photoadaptation xanthophyll cycling and reactive oxygen dynamics outputs of a simulation at the gbr wide scale show promise for predicting mass bleaching events and the behaviour at the scale of davies reef appear reasonable at this point in the model development components of the model derivation are uncertain and the laboratory and field data sets to assess the model outputs are still emerging nonetheless this represents the first application of a sophisticated coral bleaching model applied across a entire shelf system 4 1 model formulation the coral symbiont model presented here is derived from process representations that take advantage where possible of geometric or physical constraints the geometric descriptions used include 1 a relationship between polyp biomass and coral cover derived from a random placement geometric model eq 2 2 the limiting term for zooxanthellae self shading based on the derivative of the absorption cross section against absorption of the pigments eq 12 3 the uptake of dissolved nutrients through a diffusive boundary layer eq 9 and 4 the space limitation of zooxanthellae using zooxanthellae projected areas in a two layer gastrodermal cell anatomy eq 10 one advantage of this geometric approach is that it often requires fewer and better constrained parameters than empirical process descriptions this approach has proven successful in other marine biogeochemical applications baird et al 2004a wild allen et al 2013 and is fundamental to the formulation of the ereefs biogeochemical model baird et al 2016b the process descriptions also take advantage of stoichiometric relationships between reaction centre numbers photons absorbed and the concentration of reactive oxygen species created it is a unique characteristic of the ereefs biogeochemical water column optical model baird et al 2016b that the processes of absorption by photoautotrophs are photon conserving such that the photosynthetic growth processes in phytoplankton and benthic plants are a function of stoichiometric combination of photons and nitrogen and phosphorus baird et al 2001 this approach is also applied in zooxanthellae with the absorption coefficient of the multiple pigments determining the number of photons absorbed and then this quantity reduces reaction centres or accumulates carbon or reactive oxygen in stoichiometrically determined ratios by using these constraints the model is able to resolve reaction centre state fig 4 and include the processes of photoinhibition and reactive oxygen generation with the inclusion of just a few new model parameters such as the stoichiometric ratio of rcii units to photons m rcii and a few temperature dependent reaction rates we openly recognise that we do not have the knowledge to follow all processes mechanistically thus the inactivation of the rubisco mediated carbon fixation eq 20 the repair rate of inhibited reaction centres eq 26 and the detoxification rate of reactive oxygen species eq 27 are temperature dependent empirical formulations for which the underlying biochemical reactions are not resolved additionally the reactive oxygen concentration that initiates bleaching ros threshold and the mathematical form of the expulsion above this threshold eq 28 are based on simple reasoning emerging laboratory techniques murphy et al 2017 may provide the quantitative understanding necessary to formulate more mechanistic process descriptions the descriptions of ros dynamics that are empirically formulated are the characteristics that would be considered unique for temperature tolerant corals bay et al 2016 and thus those that may determine the resilience of reefs in the future matz et al 2018 as these uncertainties are fundamental to some management strategies being considered anthony et al 2017 it is urgent that modellers use the emerging understanding of the processes driving ros toxicity as it becomes available there is also considerable uncertainty of the role of all pigments in the electron chain fujiki and taguchi 2001 propose that the photosynthetic xanthophyll pigment diadinoxanthin does not pass photons onto chlorophyll a while other works suggest photosynthetic xanthophylls do drive carbon fixation falkowski and raven 2007 in this paper we provide a path from diadinoxanthin absorption to carbon fixation fig 4 other detailed structural studies show that the morphology of the pigment bed changes with physiological status liu et al 2004 thus potentially changing the roles of pigments the challenge of including knowledge from detailed biochemical studies like these is formidable and is not attempted here even in the cases where physical constraints are used in the model formulation there is uncertainty regarding their form for example the model presented here uses sphere packing geometry in a two layer gastrodermal cell anatomy to determine the translocation fraction of zooxanthellae growth eq 10 another study van woesik et al 2010 for example considers layers of cells stacked vertically with the light intensity of lower layers limiting zooxanthellae density while it may be possible to choose the most appropriate mechanistic formulation for a particular coral species the task of choosing a generic form as we have attempted here inevitably has shortcomings the model developed here does not consider all phenomena relevant to bleaching for example the model considers only one mechanism for thermal stress induced bleaching while the existence of bleaching under low light conditions demonstrates that other mechanisms exist tolleter et al 2013 further only one generic coral type and one symbiodinium clade is considered thus the simulation here is not able to resolve the differences between temperature tolerances of different corals assemblages bay et al 2016 finally the ereefs biogeochemical model baird et al 2016b that incorporates the new zooxanthellae photophysiological processes derived in this paper represents only a fraction of the processes affecting coral health for example the model represents only one coral type and one macroalgae type and considers the only interaction between the two is a competition for nutrients and light a more sophisticated ecosystem or habitat style model would consider multiple coral and seagrass types inhabiting particular niches on the seabed and interacting with a range of herbivorous fish bozec et al 2018 such an improved representation of coral mortality which could include other processes such as cyclone damage and starfish grazing babcock et al 2016 would remove the need for the ad hoc quadratic mortality term for coral hosts despite all the simplifications and omissions the model developed here does represent a comprehensive set of processes spanning scales from the polyp processes to the shelf scale and from nutrient and photochemical interactions to coral symbiosis 4 2 future applications the use of satellite derived temperature exposure alone as a measure of coral bleaching severity has been broadly successful liu et al 2014 and is used operationally at a global scale nonetheless it has not captured all bleaching events accurately and work is under way to include solar radiation in bleaching algorithms skirving et al 2018 even with additional considerations such as solar radiation satellite algorithms will always be limited to the estimation of near surface properties and their inability to consider factors affecting bleaching such as dissolved nutrients d angelo and wiedenmann 2014 that cannot be remotely sensed furthermore satellite observations will never be predictive thus the near real time prediction and forecasting of coral bleaching by a biogeochemical model such as developed here that can consider the history of temperature light and other environmental conditions at the surface of the corals provides a means to overcome some of these limitations finally a process based model is capable of explicitly representing management strategies such as local shading coelho et al 2017 marine cloud brightening or increased stress tolerance of individuals and or populations of coral or zooxanthellae anthony et al 2017 the ereefs modelling framework has already been used to optimise catchment management for the purposes of improving water quality on the great barrier reef brodie et al 2017 the bleaching model derived here will next be used to quantify the impact of interventions designed to minimise the impacts of a warming ocean on the corals of the great barrier reef acknowledgements the coral

25201,recent advances in wildlife tracking technology including the motus system have allowed researchers to continuously track small organisms with lightweight radio transmitters over large spatial and temporal ranges the quantity and format of data generated by the motus system is unprecedented and requires novel statistical methods building from the bsam package in r we propose new biologically informed bayesian state space models for animal movement in jags that include informed assumptions about behavior to apply the models we employed a localization routine on a motus data set from migrating red eyed vireos vireo olivaceus this allowed us to apply the new models to estimate unobserved locations and behaviors directed migratory flights were detected at night and often over water e g the bay of fundy the long island sound and the new york bight migratory flights were not exclusively nocturnal keywords motus bird migration state space models automated telemetry movement ecology red eyed vireo 1 introduction understanding migratory animal movement is important to conservation kays et al 2015 and has implications for public health cohen et al 2015 gaidet et al 2010 vandegrift et al 2010 and the economy kremen et al 2007 in the last five years there has been a rapid increase in the use of automated vhf radio telemetry technology to collect individual based movement data through the motus wildlife tracking system a collaborative continental scale network of automated vhf radio telemetry receivers taylor et al 2017 although this network has radically increased the spatial and temporal scale at which the movement of small organisms can be investigated the motus data collection effort has outpaced the development of methods to infer movement to date most motus studies have included only coarse tower scale localizations crysler et al 2016 gómez et al 2017 mitchell et al 2012 smetzer et al 2017 woodworth et al 2014 2015 as methods for triangulation or localization are still in development furthermore although motus data typically involve significant gaps in detection and data as tagged organisms move between stationary receivers methods for estimating behaviors or locations between receivers when organisms are undetected have not been presented state space models ssms can leverage temporally irregular data with large and variable spatial errors to predict location and behavioral states at unobserved times and are therefore a promising avenue for analyzing automated telemetry such as motus data jonsen et al 2013 patterson et al 2008 models that estimate unobserved states by accounting for observational error can make use of various types of data such as satellite telemetry jonsen et al 2005 patterson et al 2010 acoustic detector alós et al 2016 pedersen and weng 2013 and light level geolocator data winship et al 2012 in addition to being customizable to the type of data available they represent a powerful class of models that can reveal population level movement and unobserved behaviors breed et al 2017 therrien et al 2015 ssms for animal movement have two major components 1 the process model that describes animals movements mostly with variations on correlated random walks and 2 the observation model which describes the relationship between the observed data and the unobserved true states of the system e g location of animals ssms vary in their observation models i e in the model that describes the relationship of the data to the unobserved true states of animal location applying existing ssms to motus data requires an adequate observation model the most straightforward observation model stems from jonsen et al 2005 and assumes each unobserved true location is observed imperfectly with errors that follow a bivariate normal distribution of which the variance is proportional to the observation s error implementing a ssm with such an observation model requires only a localization routine that addresses the peculiarities of motus data and produces location estimates and errors motus data principally consist of time referenced signal strength values on towers with known locations these data often contain simultaneous detections in which a single radio burst is heard on multiple antennas at identical or near identical times giving the illusion that an animal is in multiple locations at once or moving at unrealistic speeds thus a localization routine that can provide estimates of location and associated locational error for both single and simultaneous detections is an important first step in applying ssms with straightforward observation models to motus data hierarchical ssms are a particularly apt choice for motus data as vhf radio transmitters are relatively inexpensive but short lived compared to other tracking devices and thus are deployed on numerous individuals of a population this data collection strategy stands to benefit from hierarchical movement models that estimate population level movement jonsen 2016 thus bayesian implementations of movement models such as in jags plummer 2003 lend themselves well to generalize to hierarchical versions furthermore a bayesian framework allows researchers to easily integrate multiple data sources and inform movement models with contextualized ancillary data streams like heart rate attraction surfaces cyclical behaviors or natural history e g mcclintock et al 2012 2013 mcclintock and michelot 2017 last while ssms may suffer from convergence problems in some cases auger méthé et al 2016 bayesian model estimates can be rapidly scrutinized with conventional convergence diagnostics gelman et al 2013 in this paper we demonstrate a ssm approach for automated telemetry data by adapting and extending a bayesian hierarchical state space model from the r bsam package jonsen et al 2005 jonsen 2016 jonsen et al 2017 we use motus data collected on migratory red eyed vireos vireo olivaceus along the eastern coast of the usa smetzer et al 2017 as a case study we present a novel localization routine for estimating locations and associated spatial error from automated telemetry data that allows us to use the observation model of jonsen et al 2005 we use the derived localizations to fit a suite of hierarchical movement models to the location data to 1 estimate unobserved locations and behaviors 2 test ecological hypotheses about migration and stopover ecology and 3 demonstrate methods for incorporating ancillary ecological data into this modeling approach finally we annotate the estimated trajectories with landscape data to assess landscape level associations of unobserved behaviors at the population level 2 methods 2 1 motus system motus named after the latin for movement relies on the collaboration of disparate researchers to learn how animals move given a species of interest one researcher or group of researchers affixes transmitters to individual animals typically birds or bats who are caught and released the transmitters emit at a very high frequency vhf radio signal and are scaled to the size of the animal so that their movement is not hindered or altered because of these size limitations the emitted signal has a very limited range thus the researcher relies on others who establish and maintain receivers that passively listen for the vhf emissions while the motus project originated in canada there are receivers along the eastern coast of the united states through central america and northeastern south america as well as some in europe and australia the passive nature of the receivers and the collaboration across continents allows animals to be tracked to locations they may not have been expected to travel however there are limitations inherent in this system not seen in satellite tracking while satellites can travel over water receiver towers are limited to where people can erect and maintain them taylor et al 2017 2 2 data structure and localization we applied the localization procedure to motus detections from red eyed vireos vireo olivaceus captured and outfitted with vhf radio transmitters avian nanotag ntqb 2 lotek wireless inc newmarket on 40 d expected tag life 0 29 g during fall migration in the gulf of maine usa in 2014 smetzer et al 2017 birds were tracked with the motus network taylor et al 2017 a regional scale array of automated telemetry stations that in 2014 spanned primarily the east coast of north america from northern nova scotia to maryland and parts of the great lakes smetzer et al 2017 fig 2 telemetry stations consisted of one to three 9 element yagi antennas mounted atop elevated structures or occasionally omni directional antennas attached to lotek or sensorgnome www sensorgnome org receivers calibration studies with this technology have shown detection ranges of approximately 12 km for birds aloft and 2 km for birds on the ground for 9 element yagi antennas mills et al 2011 taylor et al 2011 we only included detection events that consisted of 3 bursts of a given id at multiples of the tag s burst interval to eliminate false positives smetzer et al 2017 woodworth et al 2015 for sufficiency we also limited our analysis to birds with a 150 detections at 7 stations we trimmed portions of the tracks to eliminate long periods ca 3 days during which the telemetry array did not detect the birds this yielded 72 069 detections from 7 birds between september 19 and october 9 2014 we used basic principles of antenna geometry to assign coarse locations to birds for tag bursts recorded on one yagi antenna i e single detections we estimated a location along the directional beam because the power received by directional antennas is maximized along the beam friis 1946 shaw 2013 we assumed birds detected outside the capture site were aloft and those at the capture site were still on the ground in stopover we thus assigned all single detections at the capture site a location 1 km along the beam i e half the typical detection range for grounded birds and those outside the capture site a location 6 km down the beam of the detecting yagi antenna smetzer et al 2017 we assigned the latitude and longitude of the receiver as location for any detections on omnidirectional antennas for tag bursts recorded on 1 antenna i e simultaneous detections we assigned locations for each detection using the same routine and subsequently took a weighted average of the point estimates we derived weights by scaling signal strength values to the range of all values in the data set this approach weighted the localization closer in space to the center of the antenna beam on which the strongest signal strength value was recorded we estimated location specific error for each detection also using principles of antenna theory we incorporated potential error arising from antenna geometry and orientations signal strength and number of antennas recording a given tag burst but ignored other potential error sources such as tag orientation weather and altitude we first modeled spatial error as a function of antenna orientation we assumed the maximum latitudinal error of 6 km i e half the extent of the beam s detection range occurred on antennas oriented north and south and that the maximum longitudinal error of 6 km occurred on those oriented east or west we similarly assumed longitudinal error was minimized on north south antennas and latitudinal error on east west antennas we specifically assigned the minimum error as 1 89 km which is roughly half the distance across the 35 detection beam of the antenna at 6 km distance down the beam thus the longitudinal error for birds aloft oscillates sinusoidally between 6 km at 90 270 and 1 89 km at 0 180 while the latitudinal error oscillates sinusoidally between 6 km at 180 0 and 1 89 km at 90 270 fig 1 the error term is thus the largest possible radius that could serve to delimit potential locations following the same procedure we calculated associated error terms ranging from 1 km to 0 32 km for detections at the banding site fig 1 we assigned uniform 1 km errors to detections on omnidirectional antennas given their low detection range for simultaneous detections we weighted the longitudinal and latitudinal errors by signal strength as with the point estimates thus each location estimate was given a point estimate and an estimate of error in both longitude and latitude the resulting tracks contained point estimates each with corresponding latitudinal and longitudinal errors appendix a in supplementary material 2 3 model presentation and extension we built on the hierarchical first difference correlated random walk for gps data hereafter hdcrws model presented by jonsen 2016 and subsequently modified in the r package bsam jonsen et al 2017 the bsam package makes use of bayesian estimation of ssm parameters that govern movements as well as discrete time continuous space estimates of location and behavior hereafter location behavior at each point in time the bsam package was originally written for gps and argos data and can thus handle data that is temporally irregular and highly variable in spatial error jonsen et al 2005 jonsen 2016 hence a localization procedure that estimates even coarse locations and location errors can make the bsam package accessible to motus users the hdcrws model is also an apt choice for motus data as it returns movement model parameters estimated over multiple animals tracks as well as location and behavioral estimates for unobserved states at discrete timesteps along the tracks the hdcrws model includes both a process model and a measurement error model for graphical representation see appendix d in supplementary material the measurement error model serves to leverage information of a tagged animal s observed location even if it is observed imprecisely we utilized the measurement error model for gps data proposed by jonsen 2016 in the hssm function briefly the measurement errors for each location y i which corresponds to a detection are assumed to each follow bivariate normal distributions with detection specific variances i that are expanded by a tag specific scalar ψ jonsen 2016 eq 8 the observed y i are the direct output from the localization procedure observations are denoted with i and are temporally irregular as the detections and thus locations are obtained whenever the bird enters the detection range thus the observed location y i comes from the true location μ i but is contaminated with observation error ν i as y i μ i ν i this measurement error follows a bivariate normal distribution and the width of the symmetrical measurement error distribution is determined by the magnitude of observed longitudinal and latitudinal error τ l o n i 2 and τ l a t i 2 respectively we let ν i n n o ψ n ω i n where ω i n τ l o n i 2 0 0 τ l a t i 2 the parameter ψ n represents animal specific measurement error scalars where n denotes the individual animal for identifiability we set l o g ψ n u 10 10 this yields animal specific variance parameters as the same tags may yield different amounts of noise when attached to different animals or may be attached slightly differently this is clearly the case for motus data as well moreover a regularization equation links true states that correspond to irregular time points of detections to unobserved locations at regular timesteps which are used in the process model jonsen 2016 eq 9 this observation model and the measurement error model within leverage the varying spatial accuracy of motus localizations and harness the temporally irregularly collected data typical of motus detections the process model describes transitions between estimated unobserved locational and behavioral states at regular time intervals in a biologically meaningful way a previous simulation study showed that including knowledge about the data generating mechanism in the process model as we demonstrate below results in improved location and behavioral estimates baldwin 2017 we first present the process model from jonsen et al 2017 and then present our modifications appendix d in supplementary material if we define the behavior of the animal at time t as b t then the set of x t and b t together delimit the trajectory throughout time forming a behavior space time prism as animals move through space a key feature that changes with their internal state is the correlation between subsequent movements for instance one state may correspond to a relatively rapid persistent movement in a direction with high correlation between subsequent movements and another to a relatively slow area restricted search with little correlation between subsequent movements a useful process model thus incorporates the potential for one of two values for a correlation between movements to govern the transition between unobserved true states b eq 1 1 x t x t 1 γ b x t 2 x t 1 ε herein the location x t is obtained by the previous location x t 1 plus the behavioral state specific correlation parameter γ b multiplied by the movement to reach x t 1 this movement is not entirely deterministic as the zero mean process noise term ε implies as ε n o σ and σ σ l o n 2 ρ σ l o n 2 σ l a t 2 ρ σ l o n 2 σ l a t 2 σ l a t 2 σ follows an inverse wishart distribution with 2 degrees of freedom so σ l o n 2 σ l a t 2 and ρ are positive in the application we forgo estimating ρ in favor of estimating each element of σ for all practical purposes ε can be interpreted as the variability in movement the process model in eq 1 has two values for γ b as b 1 2 to denote behavioral states 1 and 2 a high value for γ 1 describes sections of the movement path with a high correlation between subsequent movements in both distance and direction for migrating birds this would likely describe migratory movements a low value for γ 2 indicates a low correlation between subsequent movements for migrating birds this would correspond to moving more randomly turning often and staying in the same area such as when foraging in an area of high concentration of resources we restrict γ 1 to remain larger than γ 2 by setting γ 1 b e t a 2 1 5 and γ 2 γ 1 u while u u 0 1 thus the model can estimate two behavioral states each characterized by different values for γ the γ b with b 1 2 however behavioral states are context dependent and not randomly chosen the hdcrws model proposes an estimatable transition matrix α j i to find the behavioral changes in the model α j i p r b t i b t 1 j so α 11 describes the chance of remaining in behavioral state 1 and α 21 describes the chance of switching to behavioral state 1 from behavioral state 2 and so forth as b 1 2 we see that α j i α 11 α 12 α 21 α 22 α 11 1 α 11 α 21 1 α 21 thus to describe the process model we must estimate the following parameters from the data γ 1 γ 2 α 11 α 21 and the elements of σ while this process model in the hdcrws is elegant and serves to describe many types of animal movement we added two new components to tailor it to modeling fall migration of songbirds in northeastern north america we specifically investigate a long held concept in ornithology migratory behavior of songbirds is a predominantly nocturnal phenomenon berthold 2001 although large scale movements are thought to be primarily nocturnal for most passerines recent evidence from automated telemetry indicates that birds often make landscape scale movements that are sometimes quite large in distance and even during the day taylor et al 2011 mills et al 2011 we thus developed night flight models nf that incorporate hour of the day as biological knowledge in the nf models we replaced the parameters α b 1 with the following expression α b 1 α b t 1 1 1 4 sin π 2 π 12 h t 1 0 75 herein h t is the decimal hour of day at time which yields a 24 hour period sinusoidal weighting of α b t 1 1 between 1 and 0 5 fig 3 dashed line this weighting reduces the chance of spuriously estimated diurnal migration behavior constrains the parameter space a model must explore and allows us to consider this model as a candidate for model selection as the nf models make a clear assumption about the magnitude of weighting applied to α b 1 we also considered when flight wf models with an estimated penalty in these models the amplitude of the sine wave can be estimated allowing the weight to α b 1 to go low as 0 depending on the tuning parameter ju fig 3 solid lines in the wf models α b 1 α b t 1 1 j u sin π 2 π 12 h t 1 1 j u and j u u 0 0 5 this model parameterization also allows us to effectively calculate the probability of flight during different hours of the day and to compare between a model that assumes strict nocturnal migratory movements nf to one that assumes potentially weakly nocturnal migratory movements wf we also considered models with a drift component d we applied the drift components only to migratory behavioral states and allowed for southern d s western d w or southwestern drift d sw in line with observed patterns of fall migration on the eastern coast of the north america a southwesterly drift is justified in the context of fall migration on the east coast as birds are known to follow geographic features like coasts during migration åkesson 1993 bruderer and liechti 1998 the process equation for the d models appears as below in eq 2 2 x t x t 1 γ b x t 2 x t 1 d b ε herein d is a 2 2 matrix with the elements of each row corresponding to the drift in longitude and latitude exhibited in each behavioral state we used combinations of uniform distributions between 1 and 0 on latitudinal and longitudinal drift components to enforce drift direction since one degree of latitude or longitude is likely well beyond the upper limit of possible additional movement in one 1 h timestep thus for the d sw model we set d 1 l o n g i t u d e u 1 0 and d 1 l a t i t u d e u 1 0 for the d w model we used d 1 l o n g i t u d e u 1 0 and d 1 l a t i t u d e 0 and for the d s model we set d 1 l o n g i t u d e 0 and d 1 l a t i t u d e u 1 0 we furthermore constrained the maximal displacement distance in a single timestep x t 2 x t 1 in all models to be less than the distance traveled if the bird were flying at 75 km h without stopping or turning e g average flight speeds of passerines alerstam et al 2007 using the nf wf and drift model features we assembled a suite of models to fit to the red eyed vireo localization data table 1 in the interest of model comparison we included a null model by modifying the hdcrws model to use one behavioral state only thus in eq 2 we replaced γ b with γ and did not estimate α in all other aspects the one state model was equal to the hdcrws model we also considered the unmodified two state hdcrws model the models hdcrws hdcrws nf hdcrws wf hdcrws d s hdcrws d w and hdcrws d sw are represented graphically in appendix d in supplementary material we obtained both a deviance information criteria dic as d i c d θ p d plummer 2003 and the widely applicable information criterion waic to compare models watanabe 2010 we defined the log likelihood of the multivariate normal distributed spatial estimates in the model code to estimate the waic using the loo r package vehtari et al 2016 2 4 application to red eyed vireo fall migration we fit all 8 movement models table 1 with 4 chains each with a burn in of 100 000 samples and obtained 50 000 samples and a thin rate of 50 to yield 1000 fin l posterior samples all models were fit to the data in using r 3 3 1 r core team 2016 and jags 4 1 0 plummer 2003 on the massachusetts green high performance computing cluster mghpcc and finished running between 6 6 and 8 9 days to address ssm estimation problems auger méthé et al 2016 we selected only models that showed adequate convergence in parameters as evinced by visual inspection of traceplots autocorrelation plots and posterior distribution as well as calculated values of r ˆ appendix a in supplementary material section 3 2 appendix b in supplementary material we eliminated models from the model selection process if any of the posterior distributions for elements of σ or γ showed poor mixing as we could not consider core components the model fully converged however we were more lenient about the convergence metrics for α in the nf and wf models because the influence of the α parameters was modulated by the circadian weight nevertheless this parameter s convergence metric never ascended above 2 16 in any of the models considered appendix b in supplementary material for diagnosing convergence in the spatial and behavioral estimates we used the more stringent cutoff of r ˆ 1 1 gelman et al 2013 and discarded all estimated timesteps for which the convergence criterion was not met in both spatial and behavioral estimates appendix a in supplementary material section 4 we used the posterior estimates from the hdcrws model to determine whether the location at each estimated timestamp was over land or water we represented spatial uncertainty in location estimates as the square root of the sum of squared breadth of the 95 credibility intervals of latitude and longitude we determined whether a posterior estimate was over land or water using the continental boundaries from the maptools r package bivand and lewin koh 2017 and rounded the behavioral estimates b as they ranged between 1 and 2 the estimated b values were beta distributed after subtracting 1 so we modeled behavior as a function of whether a point was over water or land using a beta generalized linear mixed model glmm with random intercepts for individual bird we compared this to a null model with only a single intercept term and random intercepts we ran the beta glmms with 4 chains for 10 000 iterations after a burn in of 5000 and were thinned by 10 in jags 4 2 0 all model parameters showed successful convergence and we compared models with dic and waic we also performed a chi squared test of independence on behavioral state counts and terrestrial status 2 5 uncertainty analysis we implemented an uncertainty analysis to assess variability in the model output to this end we jack knifed the hdcrws model running it seven times each time without the data from one of the seven total individual birds this allowed us to investigate the variability in 1 behavioral state separation 2 variation in spatial separation of behaviors and 3 variation in temporal separation of behavior we used r 3 4 1 r core team 2016 and the following r packages for data processing coda best et al 2010 dplyr wickham and francois 2016 geosphere hijmans et

sensorgnome brzustowski 2017 yarr phillips 2017 and the binomial histogram code from de la cruz rot 2005 3 results of the 8 models fitted to the movement data 4 showed satisfactoryconvergence in model parameters and were used for model comparison table 2 we observed high model uncertainty according to dic which only slightly disfavored the hdcrws nf model i c 0 592 among other three models using waic the hdcrws wf d sw model was favored over the next best model the hdcrws δ w a i c 13 180 however the hdcrws wf d sw model yielded 194 fewer converged location behaviors than the hdcrws model table 2 each model could have returned 907 location behaviors but many individual location behaviors were excluded due to lack of convergence all models showed similar well separated behavioral states table 3 the wf models showed a near 0 value for the ju parameter indicating a weak sinusoidal effect of time of day on the choice of behavioral state all models showed similar estimates of α values near 0 9 for α 11 and values near 0 1 for α 21 except for the nf model which revealed a broad estimate for α 21 possibly because this model experienced a strong influence of the weighting factor table 3 the temporal distribution of migratory and area restricted movements varied little among models with exception of the hdcrws nf model fig 4 herein migratory movements occurred almost exclusively at night while area restricted searches occurred almost only by day as dictated by the weighting term the high degree of model uncertainty with respect to dic indicated that there was not a clear best model as such we chose the hdcrws model as the most useful because it estimated the highest number of converged location behaviors with this we estimated numerous sections of the 7 birds tracks and delimited not only their movement trajectories but also their unobserved behaviors fig 5 migratory flights occurred over the gulf of maine the new york bight and the bay of fundy the average behavioral estimate for points over land 1 72 was higher than the average behavioral estimate for points observed over water 1 62 we found no evidence for the significance of this difference in means as the beta glmm with the binary variable fit the data minimally better than the null model δ d i c 1 5 δ w a i c 1 6 nine percent of all migratory behaviors were over land and 91 were over sea 16 of all area restricted searches were over land while 84 were over sea a chi squared test of independence between terrestrial status and behavioral state was suggestive but non significant x 2 2 9996 df 1 p 0 08329 the uncertainty analysis revealed robust behavioral state separation but a large influence of one bird revi 430 on the estimates of the parameters α 11 and α 21 moreover it confirmed the weak evidence for spatial and temporal separation of behaviors appendix e in supplementary material 4 discussion we fit eight candidate movement models to red eyed vireo migration along the east coast of north america 4 of which revealed satisfactorily converged movement model parameter estimates well separated behavioral states and hundreds of well converged location behaviors this is the first application of spatially explicit movement models to motus derived detection data this work represents an important methodological step in more fully harnessing the wealth of data from motus to infer movement paths using biologically informed ssms and reveal unobserved population level behaviors we observed that red eyed vireo migration occurs mostly at night but not exclusively so we take the equivocal poor fit of the nf model which enforces nocturnal migration as well as the low estimated values for the j u parameter in the wf models as evidence for this claim near zero values of j u suggest a weak diurnal weighting of α fig 3 and were found in both the hdcrws wf d sw and the hdcrws wf models the strict nocturnal diurnal segregation of ars and migratory behavior could break down by either ars behaviors occurring at night migration behaviors occurring by day or both nocturnal ars flights could occur from reorientation flights after abandoned nocturnal migratory departures landscape scale stopover movements mills et al 2011 smetzer et al 2017 taylor et al 2011 or from nocturnal exploratory flights to assess weather conditions schmaljohann et al 2010 the hdcrws model revealed numerous nocturnal ars behaviors and some diurnal migratory behaviors suggesting that migratory flights are not limited to the night and ars movements are not strictly diurnal we noted no significant segregation of migratory behaviors by terrestrial status however there was a slight trend towards migratory states to be more over water than ars states because terrestrial behaviors were almost entirely ars fig 6 we saw both behavioral states migration and ars over water we suspect that a larger buffer to determine the terrestrial status of birds i e by assigning locations that are within 1 km of the shoreline as land status may show some habitat segregation as some larger bodies of water can only be crossed by sustained directed flights fig 5 moreover numerous receiver antennas that received detections were located on the coast pointed towards the ocean thus the coarse localization routine would place a bird over water just by being detected on such an antenna on the other hand stopover flights are known to occur over land for red eyed vireos smetzer et al 2017 woodworth et al 2014 but it is unclear whether our two state model would classify a short stopover flight as ars or migration although all converged models reported two well separated behavioral states many of the hdcrws model s behavioral estimates were near 1 5 i e neither decidedly ars nor migratory fig 6 this suggests that two states may not be enough to sufficiently characterize the observed strategies that fall along a continuum of undirected to directed movement for instance recent automated telemetry work in the gulf of maine documented passerines making 500 km flights that were not oriented towards their migratory goals and thus not well explained by current theories in the literature brown and taylor 2017 indeed landscape scale stopover flights are widespread taylor et al 2011 and may be best modelled by a third behavioral state that lies between strict ars and highly directed migratory flights we hypothesize that multistate models with more than 2 states could further tease apart the numerous supposed pelagic ars behaviors as we doubt that red eyed vireos are foraging over water fig 6 some authors have put forth movement models with more than 2 states e g jonsen et al 2017 mcclintock and michelot 2017 and these may be fruitful for migratory birds that indeed show stopover flights such models may be able to split ars movements into reorientation stopover flights and undirected ars given sufficient spatial coverage of motus towers we further speculate using a third state that maintains a fixed value of γ 0 in the process equation could serve to identify track sections of motionlessness as the displacement is multiplied by γ and would thus be forced to 0 in that behavior all movement models must strike a balance between generality and specificity and practitioners must interpret the results of general models with caution we encountered model uncertainty and convergence issues for some location behaviors even within models that showed satisfactory process model parameter convergence we suggest that modelers who wish to reconstruct movement trajectories with bayesian ssms scrutinize the convergence of many aspects of their models and justify their choice of movement model based on model performance e g information criteria assumption importance utility the hdcrws nf model was able to eliminate diurnal migratory behavior but this came at a cost of poor model fit with waic and suggestively worse dic and fewer total converged location behaviors all models returned fewer converged location behaviors than the 907 that could have been achieved unsurprisingly most of these non converged location behaviors appear in gaps of the track that lack data additionally as gap duration increased r ˆ values for spatial and behavioral estimates as well as spatial uncertainty increased appendix a in supplementary material section 4 we thus suggest that simulation studies should address the question of how long should a gap in an animal track be before it becomes impossible to estimate the unobserved trajectory due to lack of convergence or poor accuracy such an answer could provide fruitful guidelines to practitioners who wish to apply movement models to their data and to researchers designing field studies using the motus network while we tailored our localization routine to match the observation model in jonsen et al 2005 motus detections share characteristics with data from acoustic telemetry arrays tags emit signals near continuously and stationary receivers are programmed to collect data without interruptions thus with a model for detection probability absences of detections can contribute to the localization routine or observation model c f pedersen and weng 2013 5 conclusion we have shown that through a simplistic localization routine we can fit sophisticated movement models to motus data this allows for reconstruction of unobserved flight trajectories and characterization of unobserved behaviors with process models that apply at the population level migratory behavior was not exclusively nocturnal and model estimated locations over water showed greater variability in behavioral state than terrestrial locations but no significant different in mean behavioral state we illustrated that 1 convergence of both model parameters and estimated location behaviors can be difficult and should be addressed by practitioners 2 model selection may not be a straightforward process so practitioners should justify their choice of models and 3 posterior estimates of movement tracks can be annotated with environmental data to answer ecological questions as the motus project continues to grow and more automated telemetry towers become activated both the frequency and length of unobserved sections of animals tracks will likely decrease leveraging a large quantity of movement data to estimate location and behavior during the unobserved sections remains a valid goal that we hope ecological modelling community will continue to pursue as knowledge of migration

25201,recent advances in wildlife tracking technology including the motus system have allowed researchers to continuously track small organisms with lightweight radio transmitters over large spatial and temporal ranges the quantity and format of data generated by the motus system is unprecedented and requires novel statistical methods building from the bsam package in r we propose new biologically informed bayesian state space models for animal movement in jags that include informed assumptions about behavior to apply the models we employed a localization routine on a motus data set from migrating red eyed vireos vireo olivaceus this allowed us to apply the new models to estimate unobserved locations and behaviors directed migratory flights were detected at night and often over water e g the bay of fundy the long island sound and the new york bight migratory flights were not exclusively nocturnal keywords motus bird migration state space models automated telemetry movement ecology red eyed vireo 1 introduction understanding migratory animal movement is important to conservation kays et al 2015 and has implications for public health cohen et al 2015 gaidet et al 2010 vandegrift et al 2010 and the economy kremen et al 2007 in the last five years there has been a rapid increase in the use of automated vhf radio telemetry technology to collect individual based movement data through the motus wildlife tracking system a collaborative continental scale network of automated vhf radio telemetry receivers taylor et al 2017 although this network has radically increased the spatial and temporal scale at which the movement of small organisms can be investigated the motus data collection effort has outpaced the development of methods to infer movement to date most motus studies have included only coarse tower scale localizations crysler et al 2016 gómez et al 2017 mitchell et al 2012 smetzer et al 2017 woodworth et al 2014 2015 as methods for triangulation or localization are still in development furthermore although motus data typically involve significant gaps in detection and data as tagged organisms move between stationary receivers methods for estimating behaviors or locations between receivers when organisms are undetected have not been presented state space models ssms can leverage temporally irregular data with large and variable spatial errors to predict location and behavioral states at unobserved times and are therefore a promising avenue for analyzing automated telemetry such as motus data jonsen et al 2013 patterson et al 2008 models that estimate unobserved states by accounting for observational error can make use of various types of data such as satellite telemetry jonsen et al 2005 patterson et al 2010 acoustic detector alós et al 2016 pedersen and weng 2013 and light level geolocator data winship et al 2012 in addition to being customizable to the type of data available they represent a powerful class of models that can reveal population level movement and unobserved behaviors breed et al 2017 therrien et al 2015 ssms for animal movement have two major components 1 the process model that describes animals movements mostly with variations on correlated random walks and 2 the observation model which describes the relationship between the observed data and the unobserved true states of the system e g location of animals ssms vary in their observation models i e in the model that describes the relationship of the data to the unobserved true states of animal location applying existing ssms to motus data requires an adequate observation model the most straightforward observation model stems from jonsen et al 2005 and assumes each unobserved true location is observed imperfectly with errors that follow a bivariate normal distribution of which the variance is proportional to the observation s error implementing a ssm with such an observation model requires only a localization routine that addresses the peculiarities of motus data and produces location estimates and errors motus data principally consist of time referenced signal strength values on towers with known locations these data often contain simultaneous detections in which a single radio burst is heard on multiple antennas at identical or near identical times giving the illusion that an animal is in multiple locations at once or moving at unrealistic speeds thus a localization routine that can provide estimates of location and associated locational error for both single and simultaneous detections is an important first step in applying ssms with straightforward observation models to motus data hierarchical ssms are a particularly apt choice for motus data as vhf radio transmitters are relatively inexpensive but short lived compared to other tracking devices and thus are deployed on numerous individuals of a population this data collection strategy stands to benefit from hierarchical movement models that estimate population level movement jonsen 2016 thus bayesian implementations of movement models such as in jags plummer 2003 lend themselves well to generalize to hierarchical versions furthermore a bayesian framework allows researchers to easily integrate multiple data sources and inform movement models with contextualized ancillary data streams like heart rate attraction surfaces cyclical behaviors or natural history e g mcclintock et al 2012 2013 mcclintock and michelot 2017 last while ssms may suffer from convergence problems in some cases auger méthé et al 2016 bayesian model estimates can be rapidly scrutinized with conventional convergence diagnostics gelman et al 2013 in this paper we demonstrate a ssm approach for automated telemetry data by adapting and extending a bayesian hierarchical state space model from the r bsam package jonsen et al 2005 jonsen 2016 jonsen et al 2017 we use motus data collected on migratory red eyed vireos vireo olivaceus along the eastern coast of the usa smetzer et al 2017 as a case study we present a novel localization routine for estimating locations and associated spatial error from automated telemetry data that allows us to use the observation model of jonsen et al 2005 we use the derived localizations to fit a suite of hierarchical movement models to the location data to 1 estimate unobserved locations and behaviors 2 test ecological hypotheses about migration and stopover ecology and 3 demonstrate methods for incorporating ancillary ecological data into this modeling approach finally we annotate the estimated trajectories with landscape data to assess landscape level associations of unobserved behaviors at the population level 2 methods 2 1 motus system motus named after the latin for movement relies on the collaboration of disparate researchers to learn how animals move given a species of interest one researcher or group of researchers affixes transmitters to individual animals typically birds or bats who are caught and released the transmitters emit at a very high frequency vhf radio signal and are scaled to the size of the animal so that their movement is not hindered or altered because of these size limitations the emitted signal has a very limited range thus the researcher relies on others who establish and maintain receivers that passively listen for the vhf emissions while the motus project originated in canada there are receivers along the eastern coast of the united states through central america and northeastern south america as well as some in europe and australia the passive nature of the receivers and the collaboration across continents allows animals to be tracked to locations they may not have been expected to travel however there are limitations inherent in this system not seen in satellite tracking while satellites can travel over water receiver towers are limited to where people can erect and maintain them taylor et al 2017 2 2 data structure and localization we applied the localization procedure to motus detections from red eyed vireos vireo olivaceus captured and outfitted with vhf radio transmitters avian nanotag ntqb 2 lotek wireless inc newmarket on 40 d expected tag life 0 29 g during fall migration in the gulf of maine usa in 2014 smetzer et al 2017 birds were tracked with the motus network taylor et al 2017 a regional scale array of automated telemetry stations that in 2014 spanned primarily the east coast of north america from northern nova scotia to maryland and parts of the great lakes smetzer et al 2017 fig 2 telemetry stations consisted of one to three 9 element yagi antennas mounted atop elevated structures or occasionally omni directional antennas attached to lotek or sensorgnome www sensorgnome org receivers calibration studies with this technology have shown detection ranges of approximately 12 km for birds aloft and 2 km for birds on the ground for 9 element yagi antennas mills et al 2011 taylor et al 2011 we only included detection events that consisted of 3 bursts of a given id at multiples of the tag s burst interval to eliminate false positives smetzer et al 2017 woodworth et al 2015 for sufficiency we also limited our analysis to birds with a 150 detections at 7 stations we trimmed portions of the tracks to eliminate long periods ca 3 days during which the telemetry array did not detect the birds this yielded 72 069 detections from 7 birds between september 19 and october 9 2014 we used basic principles of antenna geometry to assign coarse locations to birds for tag bursts recorded on one yagi antenna i e single detections we estimated a location along the directional beam because the power received by directional antennas is maximized along the beam friis 1946 shaw 2013 we assumed birds detected outside the capture site were aloft and those at the capture site were still on the ground in stopover we thus assigned all single detections at the capture site a location 1 km along the beam i e half the typical detection range for grounded birds and those outside the capture site a location 6 km down the beam of the detecting yagi antenna smetzer et al 2017 we assigned the latitude and longitude of the receiver as location for any detections on omnidirectional antennas for tag bursts recorded on 1 antenna i e simultaneous detections we assigned locations for each detection using the same routine and subsequently took a weighted average of the point estimates we derived weights by scaling signal strength values to the range of all values in the data set this approach weighted the localization closer in space to the center of the antenna beam on which the strongest signal strength value was recorded we estimated location specific error for each detection also using principles of antenna theory we incorporated potential error arising from antenna geometry and orientations signal strength and number of antennas recording a given tag burst but ignored other potential error sources such as tag orientation weather and altitude we first modeled spatial error as a function of antenna orientation we assumed the maximum latitudinal error of 6 km i e half the extent of the beam s detection range occurred on antennas oriented north and south and that the maximum longitudinal error of 6 km occurred on those oriented east or west we similarly assumed longitudinal error was minimized on north south antennas and latitudinal error on east west antennas we specifically assigned the minimum error as 1 89 km which is roughly half the distance across the 35 detection beam of the antenna at 6 km distance down the beam thus the longitudinal error for birds aloft oscillates sinusoidally between 6 km at 90 270 and 1 89 km at 0 180 while the latitudinal error oscillates sinusoidally between 6 km at 180 0 and 1 89 km at 90 270 fig 1 the error term is thus the largest possible radius that could serve to delimit potential locations following the same procedure we calculated associated error terms ranging from 1 km to 0 32 km for detections at the banding site fig 1 we assigned uniform 1 km errors to detections on omnidirectional antennas given their low detection range for simultaneous detections we weighted the longitudinal and latitudinal errors by signal strength as with the point estimates thus each location estimate was given a point estimate and an estimate of error in both longitude and latitude the resulting tracks contained point estimates each with corresponding latitudinal and longitudinal errors appendix a in supplementary material 2 3 model presentation and extension we built on the hierarchical first difference correlated random walk for gps data hereafter hdcrws model presented by jonsen 2016 and subsequently modified in the r package bsam jonsen et al 2017 the bsam package makes use of bayesian estimation of ssm parameters that govern movements as well as discrete time continuous space estimates of location and behavior hereafter location behavior at each point in time the bsam package was originally written for gps and argos data and can thus handle data that is temporally irregular and highly variable in spatial error jonsen et al 2005 jonsen 2016 hence a localization procedure that estimates even coarse locations and location errors can make the bsam package accessible to motus users the hdcrws model is also an apt choice for motus data as it returns movement model parameters estimated over multiple animals tracks as well as location and behavioral estimates for unobserved states at discrete timesteps along the tracks the hdcrws model includes both a process model and a measurement error model for graphical representation see appendix d in supplementary material the measurement error model serves to leverage information of a tagged animal s observed location even if it is observed imprecisely we utilized the measurement error model for gps data proposed by jonsen 2016 in the hssm function briefly the measurement errors for each location y i which corresponds to a detection are assumed to each follow bivariate normal distributions with detection specific variances i that are expanded by a tag specific scalar ψ jonsen 2016 eq 8 the observed y i are the direct output from the localization procedure observations are denoted with i and are temporally irregular as the detections and thus locations are obtained whenever the bird enters the detection range thus the observed location y i comes from the true location μ i but is contaminated with observation error ν i as y i μ i ν i this measurement error follows a bivariate normal distribution and the width of the symmetrical measurement error distribution is determined by the magnitude of observed longitudinal and latitudinal error τ l o n i 2 and τ l a t i 2 respectively we let ν i n n o ψ n ω i n where ω i n τ l o n i 2 0 0 τ l a t i 2 the parameter ψ n represents animal specific measurement error scalars where n denotes the individual animal for identifiability we set l o g ψ n u 10 10 this yields animal specific variance parameters as the same tags may yield different amounts of noise when attached to different animals or may be attached slightly differently this is clearly the case for motus data as well moreover a regularization equation links true states that correspond to irregular time points of detections to unobserved locations at regular timesteps which are used in the process model jonsen 2016 eq 9 this observation model and the measurement error model within leverage the varying spatial accuracy of motus localizations and harness the temporally irregularly collected data typical of motus detections the process model describes transitions between estimated unobserved locational and behavioral states at regular time intervals in a biologically meaningful way a previous simulation study showed that including knowledge about the data generating mechanism in the process model as we demonstrate below results in improved location and behavioral estimates baldwin 2017 we first present the process model from jonsen et al 2017 and then present our modifications appendix d in supplementary material if we define the behavior of the animal at time t as b t then the set of x t and b t together delimit the trajectory throughout time forming a behavior space time prism as animals move through space a key feature that changes with their internal state is the correlation between subsequent movements for instance one state may correspond to a relatively rapid persistent movement in a direction with high correlation between subsequent movements and another to a relatively slow area restricted search with little correlation between subsequent movements a useful process model thus incorporates the potential for one of two values for a correlation between movements to govern the transition between unobserved true states b eq 1 1 x t x t 1 γ b x t 2 x t 1 ε herein the location x t is obtained by the previous location x t 1 plus the behavioral state specific correlation parameter γ b multiplied by the movement to reach x t 1 this movement is not entirely deterministic as the zero mean process noise term ε implies as ε n o σ and σ σ l o n 2 ρ σ l o n 2 σ l a t 2 ρ σ l o n 2 σ l a t 2 σ l a t 2 σ follows an inverse wishart distribution with 2 degrees of freedom so σ l o n 2 σ l a t 2 and ρ are positive in the application we forgo estimating ρ in favor of estimating each element of σ for all practical purposes ε can be interpreted as the variability in movement the process model in eq 1 has two values for γ b as b 1 2 to denote behavioral states 1 and 2 a high value for γ 1 describes sections of the movement path with a high correlation between subsequent movements in both distance and direction for migrating birds this would likely describe migratory movements a low value for γ 2 indicates a low correlation between subsequent movements for migrating birds this would correspond to moving more randomly turning often and staying in the same area such as when foraging in an area of high concentration of resources we restrict γ 1 to remain larger than γ 2 by setting γ 1 b e t a 2 1 5 and γ 2 γ 1 u while u u 0 1 thus the model can estimate two behavioral states each characterized by different values for γ the γ b with b 1 2 however behavioral states are context dependent and not randomly chosen the hdcrws model proposes an estimatable transition matrix α j i to find the behavioral changes in the model α j i p r b t i b t 1 j so α 11 describes the chance of remaining in behavioral state 1 and α 21 describes the chance of switching to behavioral state 1 from behavioral state 2 and so forth as b 1 2 we see that α j i α 11 α 12 α 21 α 22 α 11 1 α 11 α 21 1 α 21 thus to describe the process model we must estimate the following parameters from the data γ 1 γ 2 α 11 α 21 and the elements of σ while this process model in the hdcrws is elegant and serves to describe many types of animal movement we added two new components to tailor it to modeling fall migration of songbirds in northeastern north america we specifically investigate a long held concept in ornithology migratory behavior of songbirds is a predominantly nocturnal phenomenon berthold 2001 although large scale movements are thought to be primarily nocturnal for most passerines recent evidence from automated telemetry indicates that birds often make landscape scale movements that are sometimes quite large in distance and even during the day taylor et al 2011 mills et al 2011 we thus developed night flight models nf that incorporate hour of the day as biological knowledge in the nf models we replaced the parameters α b 1 with the following expression α b 1 α b t 1 1 1 4 sin π 2 π 12 h t 1 0 75 herein h t is the decimal hour of day at time which yields a 24 hour period sinusoidal weighting of α b t 1 1 between 1 and 0 5 fig 3 dashed line this weighting reduces the chance of spuriously estimated diurnal migration behavior constrains the parameter space a model must explore and allows us to consider this model as a candidate for model selection as the nf models make a clear assumption about the magnitude of weighting applied to α b 1 we also considered when flight wf models with an estimated penalty in these models the amplitude of the sine wave can be estimated allowing the weight to α b 1 to go low as 0 depending on the tuning parameter ju fig 3 solid lines in the wf models α b 1 α b t 1 1 j u sin π 2 π 12 h t 1 1 j u and j u u 0 0 5 this model parameterization also allows us to effectively calculate the probability of flight during different hours of the day and to compare between a model that assumes strict nocturnal migratory movements nf to one that assumes potentially weakly nocturnal migratory movements wf we also considered models with a drift component d we applied the drift components only to migratory behavioral states and allowed for southern d s western d w or southwestern drift d sw in line with observed patterns of fall migration on the eastern coast of the north america a southwesterly drift is justified in the context of fall migration on the east coast as birds are known to follow geographic features like coasts during migration åkesson 1993 bruderer and liechti 1998 the process equation for the d models appears as below in eq 2 2 x t x t 1 γ b x t 2 x t 1 d b ε herein d is a 2 2 matrix with the elements of each row corresponding to the drift in longitude and latitude exhibited in each behavioral state we used combinations of uniform distributions between 1 and 0 on latitudinal and longitudinal drift components to enforce drift direction since one degree of latitude or longitude is likely well beyond the upper limit of possible additional movement in one 1 h timestep thus for the d sw model we set d 1 l o n g i t u d e u 1 0 and d 1 l a t i t u d e u 1 0 for the d w model we used d 1 l o n g i t u d e u 1 0 and d 1 l a t i t u d e 0 and for the d s model we set d 1 l o n g i t u d e 0 and d 1 l a t i t u d e u 1 0 we furthermore constrained the maximal displacement distance in a single timestep x t 2 x t 1 in all models to be less than the distance traveled if the bird were flying at 75 km h without stopping or turning e g average flight speeds of passerines alerstam et al 2007 using the nf wf and drift model features we assembled a suite of models to fit to the red eyed vireo localization data table 1 in the interest of model comparison we included a null model by modifying the hdcrws model to use one behavioral state only thus in eq 2 we replaced γ b with γ and did not estimate α in all other aspects the one state model was equal to the hdcrws model we also considered the unmodified two state hdcrws model the models hdcrws hdcrws nf hdcrws wf hdcrws d s hdcrws d w and hdcrws d sw are represented graphically in appendix d in supplementary material we obtained both a deviance information criteria dic as d i c d θ p d plummer 2003 and the widely applicable information criterion waic to compare models watanabe 2010 we defined the log likelihood of the multivariate normal distributed spatial estimates in the model code to estimate the waic using the loo r package vehtari et al 2016 2 4 application to red eyed vireo fall migration we fit all 8 movement models table 1 with 4 chains each with a burn in of 100 000 samples and obtained 50 000 samples and a thin rate of 50 to yield 1000 fin l posterior samples all models were fit to the data in using r 3 3 1 r core team 2016 and jags 4 1 0 plummer 2003 on the massachusetts green high performance computing cluster mghpcc and finished running between 6 6 and 8 9 days to address ssm estimation problems auger méthé et al 2016 we selected only models that showed adequate convergence in parameters as evinced by visual inspection of traceplots autocorrelation plots and posterior distribution as well as calculated values of r ˆ appendix a in supplementary material section 3 2 appendix b in supplementary material we eliminated models from the model selection process if any of the posterior distributions for elements of σ or γ showed poor mixing as we could not consider core components the model fully converged however we were more lenient about the convergence metrics for α in the nf and wf models because the influence of the α parameters was modulated by the circadian weight nevertheless this parameter s convergence metric never ascended above 2 16 in any of the models considered appendix b in supplementary material for diagnosing convergence in the spatial and behavioral estimates we used the more stringent cutoff of r ˆ 1 1 gelman et al 2013 and discarded all estimated timesteps for which the convergence criterion was not met in both spatial and behavioral estimates appendix a in supplementary material section 4 we used the posterior estimates from the hdcrws model to determine whether the location at each estimated timestamp was over land or water we represented spatial uncertainty in location estimates as the square root of the sum of squared breadth of the 95 credibility intervals of latitude and longitude we determined whether a posterior estimate was over land or water using the continental boundaries from the maptools r package bivand and lewin koh 2017 and rounded the behavioral estimates b as they ranged between 1 and 2 the estimated b values were beta distributed after subtracting 1 so we modeled behavior as a function of whether a point was over water or land using a beta generalized linear mixed model glmm with random intercepts for individual bird we compared this to a null model with only a single intercept term and random intercepts we ran the beta glmms with 4 chains for 10 000 iterations after a burn in of 5000 and were thinned by 10 in jags 4 2 0 all model parameters showed successful convergence and we compared models with dic and waic we also performed a chi squared test of independence on behavioral state counts and terrestrial status 2 5 uncertainty analysis we implemented an uncertainty analysis to assess variability in the model output to this end we jack knifed the hdcrws model running it seven times each time without the data from one of the seven total individual birds this allowed us to investigate the variability in 1 behavioral state separation 2 variation in spatial separation of behaviors and 3 variation in temporal separation of behavior we used r 3 4 1 r core team 2016 and the following r packages for data processing coda best et al 2010 dplyr wickham and francois 2016 geosphere hijmans et

sensorgnome brzustowski 2017 yarr phillips 2017 and the binomial histogram code from de la cruz rot 2005 3 results of the 8 models fitted to the movement data 4 showed satisfactoryconvergence in model parameters and were used for model comparison table 2 we observed high model uncertainty according to dic which only slightly disfavored the hdcrws nf model i c 0 592 among other three models using waic the hdcrws wf d sw model was favored over the next best model the hdcrws δ w a i c 13 180 however the hdcrws wf d sw model yielded 194 fewer converged location behaviors than the hdcrws model table 2 each model could have returned 907 location behaviors but many individual location behaviors were excluded due to lack of convergence all models showed similar well separated behavioral states table 3 the wf models showed a near 0 value for the ju parameter indicating a weak sinusoidal effect of time of day on the choice of behavioral state all models showed similar estimates of α values near 0 9 for α 11 and values near 0 1 for α 21 except for the nf model which revealed a broad estimate for α 21 possibly because this model experienced a strong influence of the weighting factor table 3 the temporal distribution of migratory and area restricted movements varied little among models with exception of the hdcrws nf model fig 4 herein migratory movements occurred almost exclusively at night while area restricted searches occurred almost only by day as dictated by the weighting term the high degree of model uncertainty with respect to dic indicated that there was not a clear best model as such we chose the hdcrws model as the most useful because it estimated the highest number of converged location behaviors with this we estimated numerous sections of the 7 birds tracks and delimited not only their movement trajectories but also their unobserved behaviors fig 5 migratory flights occurred over the gulf of maine the new york bight and the bay of fundy the average behavioral estimate for points over land 1 72 was higher than the average behavioral estimate for points observed over water 1 62 we found no evidence for the significance of this difference in means as the beta glmm with the binary variable fit the data minimally better than the null model δ d i c 1 5 δ w a i c 1 6 nine percent of all migratory behaviors were over land and 91 were over sea 16 of all area restricted searches were over land while 84 were over sea a chi squared test of independence between terrestrial status and behavioral state was suggestive but non significant x 2 2 9996 df 1 p 0 08329 the uncertainty analysis revealed robust behavioral state separation but a large influence of one bird revi 430 on the estimates of the parameters α 11 and α 21 moreover it confirmed the weak evidence for spatial and temporal separation of behaviors appendix e in supplementary material 4 discussion we fit eight candidate movement models to red eyed vireo migration along the east coast of north america 4 of which revealed satisfactorily converged movement model parameter estimates well separated behavioral states and hundreds of well converged location behaviors this is the first application of spatially explicit movement models to motus derived detection data this work represents an important methodological step in more fully harnessing the wealth of data from motus to infer movement paths using biologically informed ssms and reveal unobserved population level behaviors we observed that red eyed vireo migration occurs mostly at night but not exclusively so we take the equivocal poor fit of the nf model which enforces nocturnal migration as well as the low estimated values for the j u parameter in the wf models as evidence for this claim near zero values of j u suggest a weak diurnal weighting of α fig 3 and were found in both the hdcrws wf d sw and the hdcrws wf models the strict nocturnal diurnal segregation of ars and migratory behavior could break down by either ars behaviors occurring at night migration behaviors occurring by day or both nocturnal ars flights could occur from reorientation flights after abandoned nocturnal migratory departures landscape scale stopover movements mills et al 2011 smetzer et al 2017 taylor et al 2011 or from nocturnal exploratory flights to assess weather conditions schmaljohann et al 2010 the hdcrws model revealed numerous nocturnal ars behaviors and some diurnal migratory behaviors suggesting that migratory flights are not limited to the night and ars movements are not strictly diurnal we noted no significant segregation of migratory behaviors by terrestrial status however there was a slight trend towards migratory states to be more over water than ars states because terrestrial behaviors were almost entirely ars fig 6 we saw both behavioral states migration and ars over water we suspect that a larger buffer to determine the terrestrial status of birds i e by assigning locations that are within 1 km of the shoreline as land status may show some habitat segregation as some larger bodies of water can only be crossed by sustained directed flights fig 5 moreover numerous receiver antennas that received detections were located on the coast pointed towards the ocean thus the coarse localization routine would place a bird over water just by being detected on such an antenna on the other hand stopover flights are known to occur over land for red eyed vireos smetzer et al 2017 woodworth et al 2014 but it is unclear whether our two state model would classify a short stopover flight as ars or migration although all converged models reported two well separated behavioral states many of the hdcrws model s behavioral estimates were near 1 5 i e neither decidedly ars nor migratory fig 6 this suggests that two states may not be enough to sufficiently characterize the observed strategies that fall along a continuum of undirected to directed movement for instance recent automated telemetry work in the gulf of maine documented passerines making 500 km flights that were not oriented towards their migratory goals and thus not well explained by current theories in the literature brown and taylor 2017 indeed landscape scale stopover flights are widespread taylor et al 2011 and may be best modelled by a third behavioral state that lies between strict ars and highly directed migratory flights we hypothesize that multistate models with more than 2 states could further tease apart the numerous supposed pelagic ars behaviors as we doubt that red eyed vireos are foraging over water fig 6 some authors have put forth movement models with more than 2 states e g jonsen et al 2017 mcclintock and michelot 2017 and these may be fruitful for migratory birds that indeed show stopover flights such models may be able to split ars movements into reorientation stopover flights and undirected ars given sufficient spatial coverage of motus towers we further speculate using a third state that maintains a fixed value of γ 0 in the process equation could serve to identify track sections of motionlessness as the displacement is multiplied by γ and would thus be forced to 0 in that behavior all movement models must strike a balance between generality and specificity and practitioners must interpret the results of general models with caution we encountered model uncertainty and convergence issues for some location behaviors even within models that showed satisfactory process model parameter convergence we suggest that modelers who wish to reconstruct movement trajectories with bayesian ssms scrutinize the convergence of many aspects of their models and justify their choice of movement model based on model performance e g information criteria assumption importance utility the hdcrws nf model was able to eliminate diurnal migratory behavior but this came at a cost of poor model fit with waic and suggestively worse dic and fewer total converged location behaviors all models returned fewer converged location behaviors than the 907 that could have been achieved unsurprisingly most of these non converged location behaviors appear in gaps of the track that lack data additionally as gap duration increased r ˆ values for spatial and behavioral estimates as well as spatial uncertainty increased appendix a in supplementary material section 4 we thus suggest that simulation studies should address the question of how long should a gap in an animal track be before it becomes impossible to estimate the unobserved trajectory due to lack of convergence or poor accuracy such an answer could provide fruitful guidelines to practitioners who wish to apply movement models to their data and to researchers designing field studies using the motus network while we tailored our localization routine to match the observation model in jonsen et al 2005 motus detections share characteristics with data from acoustic telemetry arrays tags emit signals near continuously and stationary receivers are programmed to collect data without interruptions thus with a model for detection probability absences of detections can contribute to the localization routine or observation model c f pedersen and weng 2013 5 conclusion we have shown that through a simplistic localization routine we can fit sophisticated movement models to motus data this allows for reconstruction of unobserved flight trajectories and characterization of unobserved behaviors with process models that apply at the population level migratory behavior was not exclusively nocturnal and model estimated locations over water showed greater variability in behavioral state than terrestrial locations but no significant different in mean behavioral state we illustrated that 1 convergence of both model parameters and estimated location behaviors can be difficult and should be addressed by practitioners 2 model selection may not be a straightforward process so practitioners should justify their choice of models and 3 posterior estimates of movement tracks can be annotated with environmental data to answer ecological questions as the motus project continues to grow and more automated telemetry towers become activated both the frequency and length of unobserved sections of animals tracks will likely decrease leveraging a large quantity of movement data to estimate location and behavior during the unobserved sections remains a valid goal that we hope ecological modelling community will continue to pursue as knowledge of migration

25202,assessments of connectivity are subject to the limitations imposed by the technique used to model species movement least cost path analysis is one such commonly applied technique that has a number of associated limitations that are often discounted such as the assumption of individual omniscience or symmetrical movement between patches we contend that not accounting for methodological limitations may lead to inaccurate assessments of connectivity and thus there is a need for more robust and adaptable approaches using simulated data and in a case study on ord s kangaroo rat dipodomys ordii we present an approach that uses effective distance in this case calculated from least cost paths in combination with a spatial interaction model sim which allows one to incorporate additional landscape characteristics and interactions influencing movement thereby overcoming key assumptions and limitations associated with the least cost framework we show how various factors influencing connectivity can be incorporated how outputs from the sim can be used to quantify connectivity how outputs from different models may be compared and importantly that in both a simulated and empirical case study application the assessment of functional connectivity is sensitive to small changes to the model keywords functional connectivity spatial interaction model effective distance movement least cost path connectivity model 1 introduction a species capacity to persist in a heterogeneous environment depends on its ability to move successfully between patches of suitable habitat that promote reproduction and survival described in terms of connectivity the ability to interpret measure and quantify how well or poorly individuals move between patches has provided a metric that can be somewhat elusive to assess accurately robustly and consistently crooks and sanjayan 2006 a complete understanding of connectivity requires that both habitat patches and the space between patches the matrix are properly represented and accounted for tischendorf and fahrig 2000 ricketts 2001 kuefler et al 2010 murphy et al 2010 kennedy et al 2011 ziolkowska et al 2014 thereby ensuring that both the structural i e landscape composition and configuration and functional i e species behaviour and landscape interactions components are accounted for and represented prugh 2009 watts and handley 2010 courbin et al 2014 in practice however accounting for the multitude of factors that specifically determine functional connectivity for a species can be challenging data on the actual route s travelled between patches provides the most accurate information on connectivity for a species because a travelled route reflects both movement choices and the actual distance traversed between locations graves et al 2007 sawyer et al 2011 milanesi et al 2016 however determining actual routes requires intensive monitoring that may be logistically infeasible so often route data simply do not exist fagan and calabrese 2006 kindlmann and burel 2008 zeller et al 2012 instead much effort has been applied to developing models that account for the ways in which the matrix influences movement between patches and provide predictions for paths or corridors that provide a measure of effective distance between patches patches that are effectively closer are assumed to have greater functional connectivity currently least cost methods are the most well known and frequently applied method for calculating effective distances among patches to assess functional connectivity sawyer et al 2011 ayram et al 2016 etherington 2016 least cost approaches rely on a raster surface model of the resistance or permeability of the landscape adriaensen et al 2003 and commonly a habitat selection model such as a resource selection function rsf is used to assign resistance values then paths and effective or cost distances are calculated based on the resistance values and connectivity is assessed based on these distances generated in this way least cost paths lcps measure functional connectivity to a certain degree by accounting for matrix heterogeneity and differential landscape use by a species however when solely based on habitat selection or suitability these paths assume that species direct their movements based on habitat preferences or resource requirements and that poor or unsuitable habitat will be avoided during movements coulon et al 2015 for many species other factors affect and determine a species movements in the matrix so movement between patches and thus connectivity is determined across a wider spectrum of landscape features than just suitable or selected for habitat belisle 2005 cline and hunter 2014 vasudev and fletcher 2015 vasudev et al 2015 keeley et al 2017 therefore basing a resistance layer only on variables related to habitat selection does not comprehensively depict all the relevant landscape properties composition and configuration that determine connectivity and species movement abilities motivation cognition and physical capacities sawyer et al 2011 zeller et al 2012 mateo sanchez et al 2015 abrahms et al 2017 in such cases the assessment or prediction of functional connectivity will be lacking or inaccurate chetkiewicz et al 2006 abrahms et al 2016 resistance based least cost models have other limitations to consider the least cost approach assumes that individuals have sufficient knowledge of the landscape individual omniscience which allows one to know their desired destination and to choose an optimal route between two locations douglas 1994 adriaensen et al 2003 coulon et al 2015 etherington 2016 this assumption discounts that for some species perceptual range would limit the ability to select a precise optimal path zollner 2000 olden et al 2004 pe er and kramer schadt 2008 prevedello et al 2010 vinatier et al 2011 fletcher et al 2013 and therefore effective distance may overestimate connectivity similarly a calculated path does not provide any indication of the likelihood of a species travelling the whole length of the path or how that likelihood changes with distance and thus should be considered alongside information on a species dispersal characteristics creech et al 2014 such as a distance decay function or dispersal kernel skelsey et al 2013 additionally a lcp is calculated in a way that results in a symmetrical path between patches which assumes that the same path is travelled and thus the same effort is invested independent of which patch is the origin and which patch is the destination belisle 2005 finally least cost routes are unable to account for the influence that patch traits such as habitat quality or spatial configuration of source and destination patches e g attraction to or preference for clusters of habitat may have on connectivity fahrig 1997 rodenhouse et al 2003 visconti and elkin 2009 schooley and branch 2011 betts et al 2015 extensions of the least cost approach to overcome limitations have been proposed least cost corridors beier et al 2009 pinto and keitt 2009 savage et al 2010 resistance kernel modelling compton et al 2007 cushman et al 2013 and composite least cost approaches e g brodie et al 2015 ribeiro et al 2017 address the need to consider alternative or multiple routes when assessing connectivity however these approaches remain limited to symmetrical patch relationships and do not consider patch characteristics such as habitat quality that may determine connectivity thus to date there has been no consensus as to which approach provides the most consistent or generalizable method for providing estimates of effective distance because strong correlations to empirical data on connectivity tend to vary depending on the species and situation spear et al 2010 sawyer et al 2011 zeller et al 2012 milanesi et al 2016 simpkins et al 2017 certainly there is a need for alternative approaches for assessing connectivity that can accommodate more complex dispersal behaviours and or landscape interactions despite a growing acceptance that least cost based assessments of connectivity require more information than just landscape resistance e g vasudev et al 2015 benz et al 2016 abrahms et al 2017 keeley et al 2017 the historical and continued prominence of the least cost approach within connectivity research and management must be considered e g stevenson holt et al 2014 alexander et al 2016 ayram et al 2016 jackson et al 2016 milanesi et al 2016 with this in mind we propose an approach for assessing connectivity that allows one to address the limitations that may be associated with applying lcps such as the assumptions of sufficient landscape knowledge and symmetrical paths between patches and not accounting for patch traits our approach retains a resistance based landscape representation and the lcp model effective distances and then applies a second model a spatial interaction model sim that allows one to incorporate additional landscape characteristics and interactions influencing movement that lcps are not able to account for this second model provides count outputs that reflect numbers of movements among areas of interest i e patches to provide a more complete and comparable assessment of connectivity coulon et al 2015 more specifically in our approach the calculated lcp effective distances are the starting point representation of movement through the matrix by accounting for one aspect of species behaviour e g habitat selection then a sim is used to easily incorporate additional relevant components of the connectivity landscape such as physical features e g barriers or species behaviours e g motivation or dispersal traits and or add variables that describe attributes of patches that may increase their attractiveness or emissivity functional connectivity is then quantified and assessed using predictions of counts in and out of patches calculated from the sim in this paper we first present and demonstrate our method using simulated data by assessing the difference between a habitat selection based connectivity model and a set of adjusted models that incorporate movement and or dispersal factors that may influence functional connectivity then we apply our approach in a case study on a regional metapopulation of the endangered ord s kangaroo rat dipodomys ordii in canada to compare connectivity assessments between a habitat selection based model and alternative models that account for dispersal specific factors importantly this allows us to test whether a simple habitat selection based approach is a reasonable and stable approximation for assessing connectivity for this endangered species if the habitat selection based connectivity predictions are substantially different from alternative models that account for dispersal and or movement behaviour then there is reasonable evidence that relying only on habitat selection to assess connectivity risks making erroneous management decisions for kangaroo rats in the study region as part of our demonstration and case study we suggest ways to interpret and present outcomes of our adapted connectivity modelling method 2 methods 2 1 overview of spatial interaction models our approach uses a spatial interaction model wilson 1967 1970 a model commonly applied by social scientists to assess human connectivity as a complementary step to a lcp analysis to assess functional connectivity for a species like many ecological connectivity models distance is a primary determinant of connectivity however the model also includes variables that describe the attractiveness of destinations and the emissivity of origins a sim can take several forms depending on the input data available we use a variation of the production constrained sim which uses known or accurately estimated counts of patch emigration and the effective distance between patches to calculate predictions of 1 total immigration into each patch and 2 pairwise exchange for each patch pair in our scenarios the sim takes the form 1 t i j a i w j o i d j c i j where 2 a i j w j c i j 1 and 3 c i j d i j β tij is the total number of individuals exchanged between all origin patches i and destination patches j oi gives total outflows or emigration from each origin i wj is a variable s that describes the attractiveness of destinations dj is the unknown number of total inflows or immigration into each patch and ai acts as a balancing factor the spatial separation function cij describes the constraint of distance on connectivity which here is specified as a distance decay function that draws values for calculations from a matrix of pairwise distances dij 2 2 simulated population 2 2 1 design of simulated landscape in standard lcp configuration we demonstrate our approach using a simulated landscape and emigration data and parameter values for a hypothetical species in this way we emphasize that data and values from any species or study area can be assessed using our framework for calculation of the lcps we created a raster surface with five equally proportioned habitat selection classes and an average amount of fragmentation among classes using qrule v4 1 which generates fractal maps using the mid point displacement algorithm gardner and urban 2007 we then used a geographic information system gis to generate 16 circular randomly placed patches patch area was determined by generating random buffer diameters with the constraint that the total amount of patch habitat in the landscape would equal approximately 20 of the total landscape the combined habitat selection and patch map was converted into a resistance surface by assigning values ranging from 1 to 100 to the patches and each of the habitat selection classes where 1 was the lowest resistance habitat and 100 the highest resistance habitat fig 1 we then calculated lcps in a gis for each path effective distance was calculated as the total measured path length from centroid to centroid of the patches alternatively effective distance could be calculated as the cumulative cost along the path etherington and holland 2013 however we applied the simpler measure in this case since there is no conclusion as to which of these measures may be more representative in all cases e g schwartz et al 2009 foltete et al 2008 zeller et al 2012 avon and berges 2016 marrotte and bowman 2017 we compiled path distances into a distance matrix which served as the base landscape connectivity representation for input into a sim we set up inputs for the sim component by designating 1500 dispersing individuals as the total network flows tij and then assigned total emigration from each patch oi based on area assuming that larger patches would have proportionally higher dispersal than smaller patches we used patch area to set the attractiveness of destinations wj assuming that larger patches provide more available habitat and are more likely to be encountered by dispersing individuals for the spatial separation function cij we used a power function with the distance decay parameter β set to 2 to simulate a common inverse distance squared dispersal curve the lcp distances were used as the inputs for the spatial separation function and this model configuration became our base or standard model the calculated outputs from the sim for immigration i e total patch inflows dj and pairwise patch exchange were used to assess functional connectivity next we assembled a set of adjusted model scenarios to illustrate ways of altering components of the sim to incorporate behavioural interaction or landscape elements that may be affecting functional connectivity in addition to habitat selection each of the following model scenarios were calculated and the sim outputs of immigration and pairwise exchange were used to assess functional connectivity the connectivity assessments from the adjusted models and the standard model were compared using metrics and measures described in section 2 4 model assessment 2 2 2 adjusted connectivity model scenarios 2 2 2 1 constraints on dispersal distance the effective distance from an lcp has been used in combination with a maximum dispersal distance threshold to delineate unconnected patches in connectivity analyses urban et al 2009 landguth et al 2012 however a distance decay model more realistically models how dispersal to patches changes with distance such as when physical ability e g males disperse further than females or environmental constraints e g harsh weather conditions constrain dispersal distance to shorter distances overall vary or when a species perceptual range is limited to account for distance constraints the parameter of the distance decay function in the sim s spatial separation function is adjusted for demonstration purposes we increased the parameter β 3 higher constraint to constrain dispersal to closer patches and we decreased the parameter β 1 lower constraint to increase dispersal to distant patches 2 2 2 2 changes to the shape of the dispersal curve the use of an inverse power function is quite common to model dispersal fric and konvicka 2007 however an assessment of connectivity should consider the spatial distribution of dispersal events for species and if the inverse power function is an appropriate choice in a sim any of the different mathematical functions or kernels that have been derived to model dispersal curves can be substituted in place of the standard power function within the spatial separation term we adjusted our standard sim model using three different dispersal functions exponential decay exponential normal gaussian decay and square root negative exponential decay i e fat tailed distributions 2 2 2 3 implementation of physical barriers barriers of natural or anthropogenic origin can impact connectivity for many species epps et al 2013 and a barrier can be modelled as part of the resistance layer however as an option to reconfiguring a resistance layer the distance matrix in the sim can be manually adjusted to allow for scenario modelling of the effects of a potential barrier on connectivity e g a new road we used the sim approach to model different barrier scenarios in our landscape by increasing the pairwise distances for affected patches in the semi permeable barrier scenario effective distance for patch pairs separated by the potential barrier were doubled and in the impermeable barrier scenario the effective distance was increased to an insurmountable distance to represent an impassable barrier that effectively dissects the landscape into two separate populations 2 2 2 4 movement bias a calculated lcp is unable to account for the asymmetrical influence that landscape or environmental factors such as a prevailing wind an elevational gradient or stream current may have on movement between patches and connectivity schooley and wiens 2003 belisle 2005 we demonstrate the possibility of incorporating directional bias and unequal patch to patch distances into the sim by manually adjusting effective distances to create an asymmetric distance matrix that accounts for a southerly movement bias due to a decrease in elevation from north to south 2 2 2 5 habitat patch traits an lcp does not account for selection of patches because of differences in habitat quality or other patch traits incorporating patch quality such as by using effective patch area hanski 1994 hokit et al 2001 may better model patch connectivity e g schooley and branch 2011 effective area eap for patch p can be calculated as 4 e a p q p a p q where qp is the habitat quality of patch p ap is the area of patch p and q is the maximal habitat quality of any patch the patch quality index q ranges from 0 poorest quality to 1 highest quality and is based on an ecological variable that describes patch quality e g percent cover of a required vegetation species patch quality is incorporated into the sim by using effective area as a variable that describes the attractiveness of destination patches which gives higher quality patches more weight or pull in the model in our example we assigned a hypothetical quality value to each patch calculate eap and substituted eap for simple patch area as the destination attractiveness variable dj 2 2 2 6 clustering or accessibility bias patches spatially configured as clusters may affect connectivity due to increased structural accessibility i e greater odds of finding a patch and spatial autocorrelation effects andren 1994 fahrig 1997 with and king 1999 heinz et al 2005 altermatt and holyoak 2012 cattarino et al 2013 alternatively clustered patches may be more attractive for species that direct their movement or select patches based on conspecific attraction stamps 1988 smith and peacock 1990 serrano and tella 2003 campomizzi et al 2008 zeigler et al 2011 sim models of human connectivity account for a clustering bias in which a destination becomes inherently more favourable and attractive as clustering increases by incorporating the hansen accessibility variable hansen 1959 accessibility ai is calculated as 5 a i j w j α f c i j where wj is the population of patch j α is parameter that can be used to weight denser areas and cij describes the spatial separation between i and j 2 3 case study 2 3 1 overview we applied our approach to an ord s kangaroo rat metapopulation in canada for which connectivity has only been assessed previously using a weighted euclidean distance approach brands 2016 in the interest of assessing the cogency of a more refined lcp based connectivity approach for ord s kangaroo rat and to contribute management recommendations for this endangered species we assembled a number of different connectivity models that ranged from a habitat selection based resistance model to more complex representations that incorporate various dispersal specific factors that may determine functional connectivity then we evaluated if there were substantial and relevant differences between the predictions from the original habitat selection based connectivity model and the alternative models 2 3 2 study area and species habitat and behaviour the study area is located in suffield national wildlife area snwa in southeastern alberta where we focused on one subregion of the snwa known as the amiens region where an isolated subpopulation within the northern most extent of the ord s kangaroo rat range exists heinrichs et al 2015 brands 2016 fig 2 kangaroo rats require exposed sandy soils to create burrows and territories which are limited and patchy in the study area and thus a patchy network of dunes of various sizes and quality loosely organize subpopulations of kangaroo rats dispersal between patches occurs as young kangaroo rats leave their natal den to build burrows and establish territories the typical dispersal distance for kangaroo rats in this region is less than 500 m although dispersal movements of greater than 4000 m have been recorded gummer 1997 kangaroo rats have a very high reproductive rate and the population can increase by ten fold over a period of months therefore connectivity between patches is essential to ensure suitable territories can be found and established among the limited number of habitat patches heinrichs et al 2015 alberta environment and sustainable resource development 2013 previous studies on this population have determined that kangaroo rats select habitat comprised of exposed sandy soils partial vegetation cover low slope relatively higher elevation and in closer proximity to the major rivers in the study area bender et al 2010 koenig 2010 lcps and effective distance calculated based on habitat selection would assume movement through the matrix and thus connectivity is determined exclusively by these landscape factors importantly if this assumption is false the paths calculated from habitat selection based resistance layer may over or under estimate effective distance between patches and the resulting assessment of connectivity for kangaroo rats may be non representative in some key ways for instance it is possible that elevation and proximity to the river in the study are not predictors of movement or dispersal behaviour per se but rather more descriptive of the regional geographic characteristics of locations of suitable habitat further movement between patches is likely asymmetrical given a kangaroo rat s small size steep slopes are likely more traversable downhill than up and differences in quality among habitat patches may make patches more emissive or attractive finally the maximum dispersal ability and dispersal curve for kangaroo rats is not well known brands 2016 and thus connections especially between distant patches should be assessed carefully 2 3 3 patch assignment habitat patches in the network were defined using field survey data from a long term study on the species detailed in bender et al 2007 known and potential possible natural habitat patches were digitized in a gis and the patch areas calculated dune patches exist in varying states of stabilization that may determine patch quality for kangaroo rats so the quality of each patch was characterized and a relative quality score assigned based on previous population modelling heinrichs et al 2015 the study network consisted of 20 patches of varying size and quality table 1 count data for emigration rates from patches have not been collected extensively therefore we calculated estimates of emigration for unknown patches by using empirical data on average observed burrow counts at surveyed dune patches and by assuming a conservative increase in individuals over one season of fivefold table 1 our estimates of emigration gave total network flows of 1545 individuals a small capture recapture dataset on dispersing juveniles gummer 1997 was used to specify the spatial separation function for the base model as an inverse power function with a β parameter of 1 62 2 3 4 resistance layer generation we generated the resistance layer from a previously developed kangaroo rat rsf koenig 2010 the relative probability of occurrence map predicted from the rsf was classed into a five class resistance surface that ranged from 1 for the highest probability of occurrence locations i e low resistance to 100 for the lowest probability of occurrence locations i e high resistance patch centroids were used as origins and destinations to calculate lcps between all locations within a gis effective distances between patches were calculated as the total path length and distances were compiled into a distance matrix for use in the sim 2 3 5 sim calculation the original sim connectivity model was calculated using patch area as the input for destination attractiveness wj emigration values as the outflows oi and the habitat selection based lcp pairwise distances as the inputs for dij five alternative models were specified to account for dispersal and movement specific kangaroo rat behaviours and biological constraints that are not accounted for when using a habitat selection based resistance layer each model can be thought of as an alternative hypothesis of functional connectivity the alternative models of connectivity and the rationale and model adjustments are summarized in table 2 the alternative sims were calculated and the predictions of patch immigration and pairwise exchange were compared among models using the metrics and measures described in section 2 4 model assessment 2 4 model assessment we assessed our simulated landscape scenarios and our case study at two scales first we assessed results at the landscape scale by deriving a standardized percent linkage connectivity metric l which measures the percentage of active pairwise links or connections in the network percent linkage is calculated as the ratio of the number of active links lobs which is the number of linkages where the pairwise exchange matrix value is equal to or greater than one to the total number of links ltot in the network therefore 6 l l o b s l t o t 100 where 7 l t o t n n 1 and n is the number of patches in the network l ranges from 0 to 100 and a higher l score indicates a higher proportion of active connections within the network and suggests higher connectivity additionally we assessed the differences in connectivity predictions using two standardized metrics adapted to interpret the sim flow matrix of pairwise exchange the standardized root mean square error srmse knudsen and fotheringham 1986 and a modified sørenson similarity index ssi lenormand et al 2012 oshan 2016 evaluate the difference and similarity between models respectively srmse is calculated as 8 s r m s e i j t i j t i j ˆ 2 n n 1 1 2 i j t i j n n 1 where an srmse value of 0 indicates pairwise exchange matrices that are exactly the same and increasingly larger values indicates a greater divergence between the values of two pairwise exchange matrices the modified ssi is calculated as 9 s s i 1 n n 1 i j 2 min t i j t i j ˆ t i j t i j ˆ where ssi is bound between 0 and 1 and a value closer to 1 indicates two pairwise exchange matrices that have a greater degree of similarity second we assessed results at the patch scale by assessing the model predictions of total patch immigration and the patch counts of pairwise exchange we assessed effect size by comparing the magnitude of the difference in patch immigration totals between the original model and each of the adjusted models we also subtracted total emigration from total immigration for each patch to give net flows for patches which provides a measure for comparing patch contributions to connectivity and patch function in the network among models finally we used flow mapping to visually assess differences in scenarios and to examine spatial patterns of connectivity among the different models we compiled the sim predictions for patch immigration net flows and pairwise exchange in a gis and then compared the mapped outputs to look for spatial differences in connectivity model outputs 3 results we present the results in two parts first we present results from the demonstration landscape to highlight how the differences in sim outputs can be interpreted compared and presented for a connectivity analysis in general and then we present the results from our kangaroo rat empirical case study 3 1 demonstration landscape for the demonstration landscape alterations to the standard connectivity model resulted in substantial changes to the assessments of connectivity at the landscape scale the percent linkage measure reflects the difference in the standard model 80 8 and the adjusted models which ranged from very low to very high connectivity 9 2 to 97 table 3 the calculations of srmse and ssi measure the difference in the standard model and each adjusted model table 3 compared to the standard model the exponential normal decay and exponential dispersal functions generated the most different predictions high srmse and ssi closer to 0 and the square root negative exponential dispersal function and the weak barrier model generated predictions most similar to the standard model low srmse and ssi closer to 1 assessment of connectivity also varied substantially at the patch scale the magnitude of the difference in patch immigration was beyond 15 different for most scenarios table 4 the patch quality model had the greatest number of patches that were different from the standard model 14 of 16 patches and the exponential normal decay and exponential models had the largest differences in magnitude for individual patches i e patch inflow predictions much higher or lower than the standard model examining net flows predictions indicated the model with the most comparable semi permeable barrier model and most different exponential normal decay model predictions to the standard model table 5 several patches patches 4 5 8 13 and 16 changed in function i e from net contributors to net acceptors depending on the model specification the pairwise exchange maps fig 3 illustrate changes in pairwise relationships with changes to the model for example compared to the standard model exchange in the exponential and exponential normal models becomes concentrated among close neighbours while with the exponential square root model there is a decrease in the overall number of links but an increase in pairwise exchange among distant patch pairs the pairwise flow maps emphasize the fine scale pairwise network changes and how and where exchange among patches is redistributed and how patch relationships respond to the re specification of the original connectivity model 3 2 kangaroo rat case study for this network of kangaroo rat habitat patches changing the original connectivity model to account for a range of possible dispersal behaviours resulted in substantial changes at certain scales of the assessment of connectivity the landscape scale percent linkage scores did not vary greatly percent linkage for the original lcp based kangaroo rat connectivity model was 67 1 and in the alternative models it ranged from 63 9 to 74 2 table 6 the quality dispersal accessibility model predicted the lowest connectivity and the lower dispersal constraint model predicted the highest connectivity at the landscape scale srmse and ssi comparisons of the alternative models to the rsf based model ranged from 0 47 to 1 53 and 0 73 to 0 90 respectively table 6 at the landscape level the quality dispersal clustering model generated the most different predictions from the original model at the patch scale differences in connectivity measures were more substantial for all alternative scenarios immigration differed by more than 15 for more than one third of patches in the network and differences of more than 20 were not uncommon table 7 the quality dispersal accessibility model had the greatest patch level differences for immigration in both number of patches and number of inflows with some patches having predicted immigration differing from the original model by more than 50 only two patches patches 6 and 17 retained relatively consistent totals for patch immigration among the different models net flows for patches also differed substantially between the original model and each of the alternative models table 8 many patches were consistent in producing positive or negative net flows among the different connectivity models however six patches patches 2 3 8 9 10 and 16 changed between producing positive or negative net flows depending on the connectivity model we mapped total patch immigration net flows and pairwise exchange for the original model and the isolation model and the quality dispersal accessibility model since they were the two alternative models that generated the most different predictions as judged by the landscape and patch metrics fig 4 the map comparisons illustrate and confirm that there are notable differences in the existence and strength of pairwise relationships when the connectivity model is changed to account for patch characteristics and or dispersal behaviours accounting for the isolation of the river valley patches patches 1 2 and 9 resulted in an increase in total immigration for several of the interior dune patches patches 4 5 7 10 11 and 19 these increases in immigration resulted in notable changes in net flows for patches 2 9 and 20 and patch 16 changed from having negative to positive net flows in the pairwise exchange flow map the decrease in pairwise connections overall especially among the river valley and upper habitat patch regions is illustrated compared to the original model the isolation model decreases pairwise exchange among the river valley and upper dune regions especially for more distant patches and exchange is increased among some upper habitat patches patches 4 5 7 8 and 14 accounting for patch quality a greater dispersal constraint and a higher attractiveness of clustered patches resulted in an increase in total immigration for primarily high quality patches substantive changes in net flows occurred for patch 16 which changed from negative to positive net flows and for the two large river valley patches patch 2 and 9 which changed from positive to negative net flows reflecting the decrease in attractiveness for these lower quality locations compared to the original model pairwise exchange is concentrated among closer patches and there is an increase in the relationships between higher quality patches and in and amongst the interior patches of the network patches 14 16 patches 10 11 in all models the patch cluster of patch 12 and 13 and the cluster of patches 6 17 and 18 are likely effectively isolated from the rest of the network as shown by very low predictions of pairwise flow 5 to other patches 4 discussion understanding and assessing functional connectivity is essential for conservation however current approaches to modelling functional connectivity that employ least cost modelling are still hindered by assumptions and limitations especially when it comes to incorporating aspects of species behaviour or movement we attempt to confront this issue by presenting an approach for assessing functional connectivity that expands and builds upon commonly applied techniques and methods and provides the opportunity to address methodological limitations and or missing variables or influences specifically we have shown how a sim can be used with existing effective distance measures to generate and compare alternative models of connectivity and determine whether substantial differences exist that may warrant more cautious conclusions regarding connectivity while conventional methods allow one to explore the effects of different resistance values or different resistance layers on connectivity e g cushman et al 2013 uncertainties and assumptions permeate connectivity analyses beyond the resistance layer notably when there is uncertainty associated with effective distances such as when factors other than resource or habitat selection influence movement between locations e g asymmetrical movement when a resistance layer is generated at a resolution or scale that may be missing or obscuring landscape elements that influence movement sawyer et al 2011 remelgado et al 2017 or when there is a need to compare different hypotheses of functional connectivity it becomes important to know whether and how an assessment of connectivity changes rayfield et al 2010 sawyer et al 2011 our sim approach is a straightforward and readily adaptable approach that provides several types of flow outputs that allow one to explicitly determine at which scale e g landscape versus patch scale connectivity and or connections are affected as the model is changed further while we applied lcp distance as the distance input into the sim any distance measure e g resistance distance genetic distance can be used in the distance matrix we therefore contend that the sim component of our approach will be valuable to a wide range of researchers and practitioners because it can be used to update previous assessments compare scenarios and test for sensitivity when assessing connectivity under conditions of data deficiency or uncertainty e g ribeiro et al 2017 being able to assess differences in alternative models of connectivity is both relevant to theoretical and empirical studies in both our demonstration and case study we found that incorporating factors not originally specified in the resistance layer had a considerable effect on predictions of connectivity which we hope compels ecologists to consider that assessments of functional connectivity may be very sensitive to changes in how the landscape is represented and modelled especially at the patch scale even in instances where the landscape scale network measures such as percent linkage srmse or ssi described arguably negligible differences in the models overall the patch scale flow measures and pairwise flow comparisons unique to the sim approach revealed pertinent and invaluable information on how changes to the model affected pairwise relationships and individual patch function these extra levels of information confirmed that for our assessments of connectivity accounting for additional aspects of the environment or dispersal behaviour that may influence functional connectivity provides substantially different conclusions thus we reiterate that patch connections and exchange at the pairwise level can be extremely sensitive to both species characteristics such as dispersal ability and small changes in the interpretation and representation of the landscape and that these sensitivities may be missed by assessments or metrics that are measured at the landscape scale further this type of approach that permits comparison among several different models can help to identify patch relationships that are relatively stable or are sensitive to changes in the representation our approach will be particularly useful when dealing with small and or sensitive populations the absolute counts of flows predicted from the sim allow one to quantify very small changes in immigration in pairwise exchange down to changes in single dispersers when compared to patch incidence metapopulation models or connectivity approaches that rely on binary designations of unoccupied versus occupied to describe patch occupancy and rank the importance or contribution of patches the value of knowing how model predictions change in absolute number of individuals at the patch scale when managing small populations is evident our case study on a small population of kangaroo rats revealed prominent differences in patch relationships and patch function in the network between a connectivity assessment based solely on a habitat selection model versus models that incorporated specific and unique components of dispersal and behaviour for this regional metapopulation the strength and existence of pairwise relationships were not consistent as the connectivity model was changed which highlights the sensitivity and possible unpredictability of this system at the patch scale with respect to modelling connectivity this has important implications for management in this region since habitat restoration and translocations are key directives for species management bender et al 2010 brands 2016 ultimately we suggest that it is presumptuous to assume habitat selection and movement behaviour are equivalent for this network of kangaroo rats and doing so may provide a mistaken understanding of connectivity and patch relationships that could hinder conservation efforts we suggest that a more concerted effort be made to understand dispersal and movement behaviour of this endangered species before conclusions about connectivity are made and used to inform management specifically if empirical data on patch immigration and emigration rates could be collected then the connectivity models presented could be validated to determine what habitat and movement factors are determining functional connectivity for the species in this location we concede that there are other factors that may also affect connectivity that are not currently addressed by our framework in our demonstration and case study our modified models incorporated additional attractiveness and emissivity variables as is without considering that some variables may have a greater influence on connectivity than others e g murphy et al 2010 while not presented here variables in sims can be weighted using constants or can include parameters to model more complex relationships e g an exponential relationship between a variable and connectivity and the weightings of variables can be specified based on known empirical relationships and or biological knowledge e g bossenbroek et al 2001 where these data are lacking variable specification may be explored in more of a sensitivity analysis investigation by testing different weighting schemes and comparing outputs as well specific factors that determine dispersal success such as mortality during dispersal or the influence of density dependence on emigration or immigration to patches are not part of our modelling approach however because these may be described either as patch to patch specific effects or as patch specific traits there may be ways these effects could be incorporated into the sim framework as additional model variables which should be explored further 5 conclusion because of the complex interplay between species movement and landscape heterogeneity and the different ways this manifests as connectivity the effects of assumptions or small changes to a functional connectivity model may be unpredictable or unexpected further these effects can occur at different scales and as we have shown a measure made at one scale may miss or obscure changes to connectivity at other scales that if ignored could have drastic implications for management and conservation especially when assessing small and or sensitive populations a challenge to connectivity modelling is acknowledging that there is a tradeoff between the level of detail incorporated into a model and the robustness and reliability of its results and predictions our sim approach provides a novel solution to help ecologists better understand where uncertainty may exist and thus help to determine when an assessment of functional connectivity may be too simplistic and may need to account for additional detail regarding behaviour and movement within the matrix abrahms et al 2016 we firmly believe in species and context dependency when considering functional connectivity betts et al 2015 and maintain that the integration and application of sims for assessing connectivity provides a promising approach to addressing these dependencies and the limitations associated with current commonly applied approaches acknowledgements this work was supported by funding from alberta innovates technology futures alberta

25202,assessments of connectivity are subject to the limitations imposed by the technique used to model species movement least cost path analysis is one such commonly applied technique that has a number of associated limitations that are often discounted such as the assumption of individual omniscience or symmetrical movement between patches we contend that not accounting for methodological limitations may lead to inaccurate assessments of connectivity and thus there is a need for more robust and adaptable approaches using simulated data and in a case study on ord s kangaroo rat dipodomys ordii we present an approach that uses effective distance in this case calculated from least cost paths in combination with a spatial interaction model sim which allows one to incorporate additional landscape characteristics and interactions influencing movement thereby overcoming key assumptions and limitations associated with the least cost framework we show how various factors influencing connectivity can be incorporated how outputs from the sim can be used to quantify connectivity how outputs from different models may be compared and importantly that in both a simulated and empirical case study application the assessment of functional connectivity is sensitive to small changes to the model keywords functional connectivity spatial interaction model effective distance movement least cost path connectivity model 1 introduction a species capacity to persist in a heterogeneous environment depends on its ability to move successfully between patches of suitable habitat that promote reproduction and survival described in terms of connectivity the ability to interpret measure and quantify how well or poorly individuals move between patches has provided a metric that can be somewhat elusive to assess accurately robustly and consistently crooks and sanjayan 2006 a complete understanding of connectivity requires that both habitat patches and the space between patches the matrix are properly represented and accounted for tischendorf and fahrig 2000 ricketts 2001 kuefler et al 2010 murphy et al 2010 kennedy et al 2011 ziolkowska et al 2014 thereby ensuring that both the structural i e landscape composition and configuration and functional i e species behaviour and landscape interactions components are accounted for and represented prugh 2009 watts and handley 2010 courbin et al 2014 in practice however accounting for the multitude of factors that specifically determine functional connectivity for a species can be challenging data on the actual route s travelled between patches provides the most accurate information on connectivity for a species because a travelled route reflects both movement choices and the actual distance traversed between locations graves et al 2007 sawyer et al 2011 milanesi et al 2016 however determining actual routes requires intensive monitoring that may be logistically infeasible so often route data simply do not exist fagan and calabrese 2006 kindlmann and burel 2008 zeller et al 2012 instead much effort has been applied to developing models that account for the ways in which the matrix influences movement between patches and provide predictions for paths or corridors that provide a measure of effective distance between patches patches that are effectively closer are assumed to have greater functional connectivity currently least cost methods are the most well known and frequently applied method for calculating effective distances among patches to assess functional connectivity sawyer et al 2011 ayram et al 2016 etherington 2016 least cost approaches rely on a raster surface model of the resistance or permeability of the landscape adriaensen et al 2003 and commonly a habitat selection model such as a resource selection function rsf is used to assign resistance values then paths and effective or cost distances are calculated based on the resistance values and connectivity is assessed based on these distances generated in this way least cost paths lcps measure functional connectivity to a certain degree by accounting for matrix heterogeneity and differential landscape use by a species however when solely based on habitat selection or suitability these paths assume that species direct their movements based on habitat preferences or resource requirements and that poor or unsuitable habitat will be avoided during movements coulon et al 2015 for many species other factors affect and determine a species movements in the matrix so movement between patches and thus connectivity is determined across a wider spectrum of landscape features than just suitable or selected for habitat belisle 2005 cline and hunter 2014 vasudev and fletcher 2015 vasudev et al 2015 keeley et al 2017 therefore basing a resistance layer only on variables related to habitat selection does not comprehensively depict all the relevant landscape properties composition and configuration that determine connectivity and species movement abilities motivation cognition and physical capacities sawyer et al 2011 zeller et al 2012 mateo sanchez et al 2015 abrahms et al 2017 in such cases the assessment or prediction of functional connectivity will be lacking or inaccurate chetkiewicz et al 2006 abrahms et al 2016 resistance based least cost models have other limitations to consider the least cost approach assumes that individuals have sufficient knowledge of the landscape individual omniscience which allows one to know their desired destination and to choose an optimal route between two locations douglas 1994 adriaensen et al 2003 coulon et al 2015 etherington 2016 this assumption discounts that for some species perceptual range would limit the ability to select a precise optimal path zollner 2000 olden et al 2004 pe er and kramer schadt 2008 prevedello et al 2010 vinatier et al 2011 fletcher et al 2013 and therefore effective distance may overestimate connectivity similarly a calculated path does not provide any indication of the likelihood of a species travelling the whole length of the path or how that likelihood changes with distance and thus should be considered alongside information on a species dispersal characteristics creech et al 2014 such as a distance decay function or dispersal kernel skelsey et al 2013 additionally a lcp is calculated in a way that results in a symmetrical path between patches which assumes that the same path is travelled and thus the same effort is invested independent of which patch is the origin and which patch is the destination belisle 2005 finally least cost routes are unable to account for the influence that patch traits such as habitat quality or spatial configuration of source and destination patches e g attraction to or preference for clusters of habitat may have on connectivity fahrig 1997 rodenhouse et al 2003 visconti and elkin 2009 schooley and branch 2011 betts et al 2015 extensions of the least cost approach to overcome limitations have been proposed least cost corridors beier et al 2009 pinto and keitt 2009 savage et al 2010 resistance kernel modelling compton et al 2007 cushman et al 2013 and composite least cost approaches e g brodie et al 2015 ribeiro et al 2017 address the need to consider alternative or multiple routes when assessing connectivity however these approaches remain limited to symmetrical patch relationships and do not consider patch characteristics such as habitat quality that may determine connectivity thus to date there has been no consensus as to which approach provides the most consistent or generalizable method for providing estimates of effective distance because strong correlations to empirical data on connectivity tend to vary depending on the species and situation spear et al 2010 sawyer et al 2011 zeller et al 2012 milanesi et al 2016 simpkins et al 2017 certainly there is a need for alternative approaches for assessing connectivity that can accommodate more complex dispersal behaviours and or landscape interactions despite a growing acceptance that least cost based assessments of connectivity require more information than just landscape resistance e g vasudev et al 2015 benz et al 2016 abrahms et al 2017 keeley et al 2017 the historical and continued prominence of the least cost approach within connectivity research and management must be considered e g stevenson holt et al 2014 alexander et al 2016 ayram et al 2016 jackson et al 2016 milanesi et al 2016 with this in mind we propose an approach for assessing connectivity that allows one to address the limitations that may be associated with applying lcps such as the assumptions of sufficient landscape knowledge and symmetrical paths between patches and not accounting for patch traits our approach retains a resistance based landscape representation and the lcp model effective distances and then applies a second model a spatial interaction model sim that allows one to incorporate additional landscape characteristics and interactions influencing movement that lcps are not able to account for this second model provides count outputs that reflect numbers of movements among areas of interest i e patches to provide a more complete and comparable assessment of connectivity coulon et al 2015 more specifically in our approach the calculated lcp effective distances are the starting point representation of movement through the matrix by accounting for one aspect of species behaviour e g habitat selection then a sim is used to easily incorporate additional relevant components of the connectivity landscape such as physical features e g barriers or species behaviours e g motivation or dispersal traits and or add variables that describe attributes of patches that may increase their attractiveness or emissivity functional connectivity is then quantified and assessed using predictions of counts in and out of patches calculated from the sim in this paper we first present and demonstrate our method using simulated data by assessing the difference between a habitat selection based connectivity model and a set of adjusted models that incorporate movement and or dispersal factors that may influence functional connectivity then we apply our approach in a case study on a regional metapopulation of the endangered ord s kangaroo rat dipodomys ordii in canada to compare connectivity assessments between a habitat selection based model and alternative models that account for dispersal specific factors importantly this allows us to test whether a simple habitat selection based approach is a reasonable and stable approximation for assessing connectivity for this endangered species if the habitat selection based connectivity predictions are substantially different from alternative models that account for dispersal and or movement behaviour then there is reasonable evidence that relying only on habitat selection to assess connectivity risks making erroneous management decisions for kangaroo rats in the study region as part of our demonstration and case study we suggest ways to interpret and present outcomes of our adapted connectivity modelling method 2 methods 2 1 overview of spatial interaction models our approach uses a spatial interaction model wilson 1967 1970 a model commonly applied by social scientists to assess human connectivity as a complementary step to a lcp analysis to assess functional connectivity for a species like many ecological connectivity models distance is a primary determinant of connectivity however the model also includes variables that describe the attractiveness of destinations and the emissivity of origins a sim can take several forms depending on the input data available we use a variation of the production constrained sim which uses known or accurately estimated counts of patch emigration and the effective distance between patches to calculate predictions of 1 total immigration into each patch and 2 pairwise exchange for each patch pair in our scenarios the sim takes the form 1 t i j a i w j o i d j c i j where 2 a i j w j c i j 1 and 3 c i j d i j β tij is the total number of individuals exchanged between all origin patches i and destination patches j oi gives total outflows or emigration from each origin i wj is a variable s that describes the attractiveness of destinations dj is the unknown number of total inflows or immigration into each patch and ai acts as a balancing factor the spatial separation function cij describes the constraint of distance on connectivity which here is specified as a distance decay function that draws values for calculations from a matrix of pairwise distances dij 2 2 simulated population 2 2 1 design of simulated landscape in standard lcp configuration we demonstrate our approach using a simulated landscape and emigration data and parameter values for a hypothetical species in this way we emphasize that data and values from any species or study area can be assessed using our framework for calculation of the lcps we created a raster surface with five equally proportioned habitat selection classes and an average amount of fragmentation among classes using qrule v4 1 which generates fractal maps using the mid point displacement algorithm gardner and urban 2007 we then used a geographic information system gis to generate 16 circular randomly placed patches patch area was determined by generating random buffer diameters with the constraint that the total amount of patch habitat in the landscape would equal approximately 20 of the total landscape the combined habitat selection and patch map was converted into a resistance surface by assigning values ranging from 1 to 100 to the patches and each of the habitat selection classes where 1 was the lowest resistance habitat and 100 the highest resistance habitat fig 1 we then calculated lcps in a gis for each path effective distance was calculated as the total measured path length from centroid to centroid of the patches alternatively effective distance could be calculated as the cumulative cost along the path etherington and holland 2013 however we applied the simpler measure in this case since there is no conclusion as to which of these measures may be more representative in all cases e g schwartz et al 2009 foltete et al 2008 zeller et al 2012 avon and berges 2016 marrotte and bowman 2017 we compiled path distances into a distance matrix which served as the base landscape connectivity representation for input into a sim we set up inputs for the sim component by designating 1500 dispersing individuals as the total network flows tij and then assigned total emigration from each patch oi based on area assuming that larger patches would have proportionally higher dispersal than smaller patches we used patch area to set the attractiveness of destinations wj assuming that larger patches provide more available habitat and are more likely to be encountered by dispersing individuals for the spatial separation function cij we used a power function with the distance decay parameter β set to 2 to simulate a common inverse distance squared dispersal curve the lcp distances were used as the inputs for the spatial separation function and this model configuration became our base or standard model the calculated outputs from the sim for immigration i e total patch inflows dj and pairwise patch exchange were used to assess functional connectivity next we assembled a set of adjusted model scenarios to illustrate ways of altering components of the sim to incorporate behavioural interaction or landscape elements that may be affecting functional connectivity in addition to habitat selection each of the following model scenarios were calculated and the sim outputs of immigration and pairwise exchange were used to assess functional connectivity the connectivity assessments from the adjusted models and the standard model were compared using metrics and measures described in section 2 4 model assessment 2 2 2 adjusted connectivity model scenarios 2 2 2 1 constraints on dispersal distance the effective distance from an lcp has been used in combination with a maximum dispersal distance threshold to delineate unconnected patches in connectivity analyses urban et al 2009 landguth et al 2012 however a distance decay model more realistically models how dispersal to patches changes with distance such as when physical ability e g males disperse further than females or environmental constraints e g harsh weather conditions constrain dispersal distance to shorter distances overall vary or when a species perceptual range is limited to account for distance constraints the parameter of the distance decay function in the sim s spatial separation function is adjusted for demonstration purposes we increased the parameter β 3 higher constraint to constrain dispersal to closer patches and we decreased the parameter β 1 lower constraint to increase dispersal to distant patches 2 2 2 2 changes to the shape of the dispersal curve the use of an inverse power function is quite common to model dispersal fric and konvicka 2007 however an assessment of connectivity should consider the spatial distribution of dispersal events for species and if the inverse power function is an appropriate choice in a sim any of the different mathematical functions or kernels that have been derived to model dispersal curves can be substituted in place of the standard power function within the spatial separation term we adjusted our standard sim model using three different dispersal functions exponential decay exponential normal gaussian decay and square root negative exponential decay i e fat tailed distributions 2 2 2 3 implementation of physical barriers barriers of natural or anthropogenic origin can impact connectivity for many species epps et al 2013 and a barrier can be modelled as part of the resistance layer however as an option to reconfiguring a resistance layer the distance matrix in the sim can be manually adjusted to allow for scenario modelling of the effects of a potential barrier on connectivity e g a new road we used the sim approach to model different barrier scenarios in our landscape by increasing the pairwise distances for affected patches in the semi permeable barrier scenario effective distance for patch pairs separated by the potential barrier were doubled and in the impermeable barrier scenario the effective distance was increased to an insurmountable distance to represent an impassable barrier that effectively dissects the landscape into two separate populations 2 2 2 4 movement bias a calculated lcp is unable to account for the asymmetrical influence that landscape or environmental factors such as a prevailing wind an elevational gradient or stream current may have on movement between patches and connectivity schooley and wiens 2003 belisle 2005 we demonstrate the possibility of incorporating directional bias and unequal patch to patch distances into the sim by manually adjusting effective distances to create an asymmetric distance matrix that accounts for a southerly movement bias due to a decrease in elevation from north to south 2 2 2 5 habitat patch traits an lcp does not account for selection of patches because of differences in habitat quality or other patch traits incorporating patch quality such as by using effective patch area hanski 1994 hokit et al 2001 may better model patch connectivity e g schooley and branch 2011 effective area eap for patch p can be calculated as 4 e a p q p a p q where qp is the habitat quality of patch p ap is the area of patch p and q is the maximal habitat quality of any patch the patch quality index q ranges from 0 poorest quality to 1 highest quality and is based on an ecological variable that describes patch quality e g percent cover of a required vegetation species patch quality is incorporated into the sim by using effective area as a variable that describes the attractiveness of destination patches which gives higher quality patches more weight or pull in the model in our example we assigned a hypothetical quality value to each patch calculate eap and substituted eap for simple patch area as the destination attractiveness variable dj 2 2 2 6 clustering or accessibility bias patches spatially configured as clusters may affect connectivity due to increased structural accessibility i e greater odds of finding a patch and spatial autocorrelation effects andren 1994 fahrig 1997 with and king 1999 heinz et al 2005 altermatt and holyoak 2012 cattarino et al 2013 alternatively clustered patches may be more attractive for species that direct their movement or select patches based on conspecific attraction stamps 1988 smith and peacock 1990 serrano and tella 2003 campomizzi et al 2008 zeigler et al 2011 sim models of human connectivity account for a clustering bias in which a destination becomes inherently more favourable and attractive as clustering increases by incorporating the hansen accessibility variable hansen 1959 accessibility ai is calculated as 5 a i j w j α f c i j where wj is the population of patch j α is parameter that can be used to weight denser areas and cij describes the spatial separation between i and j 2 3 case study 2 3 1 overview we applied our approach to an ord s kangaroo rat metapopulation in canada for which connectivity has only been assessed previously using a weighted euclidean distance approach brands 2016 in the interest of assessing the cogency of a more refined lcp based connectivity approach for ord s kangaroo rat and to contribute management recommendations for this endangered species we assembled a number of different connectivity models that ranged from a habitat selection based resistance model to more complex representations that incorporate various dispersal specific factors that may determine functional connectivity then we evaluated if there were substantial and relevant differences between the predictions from the original habitat selection based connectivity model and the alternative models 2 3 2 study area and species habitat and behaviour the study area is located in suffield national wildlife area snwa in southeastern alberta where we focused on one subregion of the snwa known as the amiens region where an isolated subpopulation within the northern most extent of the ord s kangaroo rat range exists heinrichs et al 2015 brands 2016 fig 2 kangaroo rats require exposed sandy soils to create burrows and territories which are limited and patchy in the study area and thus a patchy network of dunes of various sizes and quality loosely organize subpopulations of kangaroo rats dispersal between patches occurs as young kangaroo rats leave their natal den to build burrows and establish territories the typical dispersal distance for kangaroo rats in this region is less than 500 m although dispersal movements of greater than 4000 m have been recorded gummer 1997 kangaroo rats have a very high reproductive rate and the population can increase by ten fold over a period of months therefore connectivity between patches is essential to ensure suitable territories can be found and established among the limited number of habitat patches heinrichs et al 2015 alberta environment and sustainable resource development 2013 previous studies on this population have determined that kangaroo rats select habitat comprised of exposed sandy soils partial vegetation cover low slope relatively higher elevation and in closer proximity to the major rivers in the study area bender et al 2010 koenig 2010 lcps and effective distance calculated based on habitat selection would assume movement through the matrix and thus connectivity is determined exclusively by these landscape factors importantly if this assumption is false the paths calculated from habitat selection based resistance layer may over or under estimate effective distance between patches and the resulting assessment of connectivity for kangaroo rats may be non representative in some key ways for instance it is possible that elevation and proximity to the river in the study are not predictors of movement or dispersal behaviour per se but rather more descriptive of the regional geographic characteristics of locations of suitable habitat further movement between patches is likely asymmetrical given a kangaroo rat s small size steep slopes are likely more traversable downhill than up and differences in quality among habitat patches may make patches more emissive or attractive finally the maximum dispersal ability and dispersal curve for kangaroo rats is not well known brands 2016 and thus connections especially between distant patches should be assessed carefully 2 3 3 patch assignment habitat patches in the network were defined using field survey data from a long term study on the species detailed in bender et al 2007 known and potential possible natural habitat patches were digitized in a gis and the patch areas calculated dune patches exist in varying states of stabilization that may determine patch quality for kangaroo rats so the quality of each patch was characterized and a relative quality score assigned based on previous population modelling heinrichs et al 2015 the study network consisted of 20 patches of varying size and quality table 1 count data for emigration rates from patches have not been collected extensively therefore we calculated estimates of emigration for unknown patches by using empirical data on average observed burrow counts at surveyed dune patches and by assuming a conservative increase in individuals over one season of fivefold table 1 our estimates of emigration gave total network flows of 1545 individuals a small capture recapture dataset on dispersing juveniles gummer 1997 was used to specify the spatial separation function for the base model as an inverse power function with a β parameter of 1 62 2 3 4 resistance layer generation we generated the resistance layer from a previously developed kangaroo rat rsf koenig 2010 the relative probability of occurrence map predicted from the rsf was classed into a five class resistance surface that ranged from 1 for the highest probability of occurrence locations i e low resistance to 100 for the lowest probability of occurrence locations i e high resistance patch centroids were used as origins and destinations to calculate lcps between all locations within a gis effective distances between patches were calculated as the total path length and distances were compiled into a distance matrix for use in the sim 2 3 5 sim calculation the original sim connectivity model was calculated using patch area as the input for destination attractiveness wj emigration values as the outflows oi and the habitat selection based lcp pairwise distances as the inputs for dij five alternative models were specified to account for dispersal and movement specific kangaroo rat behaviours and biological constraints that are not accounted for when using a habitat selection based resistance layer each model can be thought of as an alternative hypothesis of functional connectivity the alternative models of connectivity and the rationale and model adjustments are summarized in table 2 the alternative sims were calculated and the predictions of patch immigration and pairwise exchange were compared among models using the metrics and measures described in section 2 4 model assessment 2 4 model assessment we assessed our simulated landscape scenarios and our case study at two scales first we assessed results at the landscape scale by deriving a standardized percent linkage connectivity metric l which measures the percentage of active pairwise links or connections in the network percent linkage is calculated as the ratio of the number of active links lobs which is the number of linkages where the pairwise exchange matrix value is equal to or greater than one to the total number of links ltot in the network therefore 6 l l o b s l t o t 100 where 7 l t o t n n 1 and n is the number of patches in the network l ranges from 0 to 100 and a higher l score indicates a higher proportion of active connections within the network and suggests higher connectivity additionally we assessed the differences in connectivity predictions using two standardized metrics adapted to interpret the sim flow matrix of pairwise exchange the standardized root mean square error srmse knudsen and fotheringham 1986 and a modified sørenson similarity index ssi lenormand et al 2012 oshan 2016 evaluate the difference and similarity between models respectively srmse is calculated as 8 s r m s e i j t i j t i j ˆ 2 n n 1 1 2 i j t i j n n 1 where an srmse value of 0 indicates pairwise exchange matrices that are exactly the same and increasingly larger values indicates a greater divergence between the values of two pairwise exchange matrices the modified ssi is calculated as 9 s s i 1 n n 1 i j 2 min t i j t i j ˆ t i j t i j ˆ where ssi is bound between 0 and 1 and a value closer to 1 indicates two pairwise exchange matrices that have a greater degree of similarity second we assessed results at the patch scale by assessing the model predictions of total patch immigration and the patch counts of pairwise exchange we assessed effect size by comparing the magnitude of the difference in patch immigration totals between the original model and each of the adjusted models we also subtracted total emigration from total immigration for each patch to give net flows for patches which provides a measure for comparing patch contributions to connectivity and patch function in the network among models finally we used flow mapping to visually assess differences in scenarios and to examine spatial patterns of connectivity among the different models we compiled the sim predictions for patch immigration net flows and pairwise exchange in a gis and then compared the mapped outputs to look for spatial differences in connectivity model outputs 3 results we present the results in two parts first we present results from the demonstration landscape to highlight how the differences in sim outputs can be interpreted compared and presented for a connectivity analysis in general and then we present the results from our kangaroo rat empirical case study 3 1 demonstration landscape for the demonstration landscape alterations to the standard connectivity model resulted in substantial changes to the assessments of connectivity at the landscape scale the percent linkage measure reflects the difference in the standard model 80 8 and the adjusted models which ranged from very low to very high connectivity 9 2 to 97 table 3 the calculations of srmse and ssi measure the difference in the standard model and each adjusted model table 3 compared to the standard model the exponential normal decay and exponential dispersal functions generated the most different predictions high srmse and ssi closer to 0 and the square root negative exponential dispersal function and the weak barrier model generated predictions most similar to the standard model low srmse and ssi closer to 1 assessment of connectivity also varied substantially at the patch scale the magnitude of the difference in patch immigration was beyond 15 different for most scenarios table 4 the patch quality model had the greatest number of patches that were different from the standard model 14 of 16 patches and the exponential normal decay and exponential models had the largest differences in magnitude for individual patches i e patch inflow predictions much higher or lower than the standard model examining net flows predictions indicated the model with the most comparable semi permeable barrier model and most different exponential normal decay model predictions to the standard model table 5 several patches patches 4 5 8 13 and 16 changed in function i e from net contributors to net acceptors depending on the model specification the pairwise exchange maps fig 3 illustrate changes in pairwise relationships with changes to the model for example compared to the standard model exchange in the exponential and exponential normal models becomes concentrated among close neighbours while with the exponential square root model there is a decrease in the overall number of links but an increase in pairwise exchange among distant patch pairs the pairwise flow maps emphasize the fine scale pairwise network changes and how and where exchange among patches is redistributed and how patch relationships respond to the re specification of the original connectivity model 3 2 kangaroo rat case study for this network of kangaroo rat habitat patches changing the original connectivity model to account for a range of possible dispersal behaviours resulted in substantial changes at certain scales of the assessment of connectivity the landscape scale percent linkage scores did not vary greatly percent linkage for the original lcp based kangaroo rat connectivity model was 67 1 and in the alternative models it ranged from 63 9 to 74 2 table 6 the quality dispersal accessibility model predicted the lowest connectivity and the lower dispersal constraint model predicted the highest connectivity at the landscape scale srmse and ssi comparisons of the alternative models to the rsf based model ranged from 0 47 to 1 53 and 0 73 to 0 90 respectively table 6 at the landscape level the quality dispersal clustering model generated the most different predictions from the original model at the patch scale differences in connectivity measures were more substantial for all alternative scenarios immigration differed by more than 15 for more than one third of patches in the network and differences of more than 20 were not uncommon table 7 the quality dispersal accessibility model had the greatest patch level differences for immigration in both number of patches and number of inflows with some patches having predicted immigration differing from the original model by more than 50 only two patches patches 6 and 17 retained relatively consistent totals for patch immigration among the different models net flows for patches also differed substantially between the original model and each of the alternative models table 8 many patches were consistent in producing positive or negative net flows among the different connectivity models however six patches patches 2 3 8 9 10 and 16 changed between producing positive or negative net flows depending on the connectivity model we mapped total patch immigration net flows and pairwise exchange for the original model and the isolation model and the quality dispersal accessibility model since they were the two alternative models that generated the most different predictions as judged by the landscape and patch metrics fig 4 the map comparisons illustrate and confirm that there are notable differences in the existence and strength of pairwise relationships when the connectivity model is changed to account for patch characteristics and or dispersal behaviours accounting for the isolation of the river valley patches patches 1 2 and 9 resulted in an increase in total immigration for several of the interior dune patches patches 4 5 7 10 11 and 19 these increases in immigration resulted in notable changes in net flows for patches 2 9 and 20 and patch 16 changed from having negative to positive net flows in the pairwise exchange flow map the decrease in pairwise connections overall especially among the river valley and upper habitat patch regions is illustrated compared to the original model the isolation model decreases pairwise exchange among the river valley and upper dune regions especially for more distant patches and exchange is increased among some upper habitat patches patches 4 5 7 8 and 14 accounting for patch quality a greater dispersal constraint and a higher attractiveness of clustered patches resulted in an increase in total immigration for primarily high quality patches substantive changes in net flows occurred for patch 16 which changed from negative to positive net flows and for the two large river valley patches patch 2 and 9 which changed from positive to negative net flows reflecting the decrease in attractiveness for these lower quality locations compared to the original model pairwise exchange is concentrated among closer patches and there is an increase in the relationships between higher quality patches and in and amongst the interior patches of the network patches 14 16 patches 10 11 in all models the patch cluster of patch 12 and 13 and the cluster of patches 6 17 and 18 are likely effectively isolated from the rest of the network as shown by very low predictions of pairwise flow 5 to other patches 4 discussion understanding and assessing functional connectivity is essential for conservation however current approaches to modelling functional connectivity that employ least cost modelling are still hindered by assumptions and limitations especially when it comes to incorporating aspects of species behaviour or movement we attempt to confront this issue by presenting an approach for assessing functional connectivity that expands and builds upon commonly applied techniques and methods and provides the opportunity to address methodological limitations and or missing variables or influences specifically we have shown how a sim can be used with existing effective distance measures to generate and compare alternative models of connectivity and determine whether substantial differences exist that may warrant more cautious conclusions regarding connectivity while conventional methods allow one to explore the effects of different resistance values or different resistance layers on connectivity e g cushman et al 2013 uncertainties and assumptions permeate connectivity analyses beyond the resistance layer notably when there is uncertainty associated with effective distances such as when factors other than resource or habitat selection influence movement between locations e g asymmetrical movement when a resistance layer is generated at a resolution or scale that may be missing or obscuring landscape elements that influence movement sawyer et al 2011 remelgado et al 2017 or when there is a need to compare different hypotheses of functional connectivity it becomes important to know whether and how an assessment of connectivity changes rayfield et al 2010 sawyer et al 2011 our sim approach is a straightforward and readily adaptable approach that provides several types of flow outputs that allow one to explicitly determine at which scale e g landscape versus patch scale connectivity and or connections are affected as the model is changed further while we applied lcp distance as the distance input into the sim any distance measure e g resistance distance genetic distance can be used in the distance matrix we therefore contend that the sim component of our approach will be valuable to a wide range of researchers and practitioners because it can be used to update previous assessments compare scenarios and test for sensitivity when assessing connectivity under conditions of data deficiency or uncertainty e g ribeiro et al 2017 being able to assess differences in alternative models of connectivity is both relevant to theoretical and empirical studies in both our demonstration and case study we found that incorporating factors not originally specified in the resistance layer had a considerable effect on predictions of connectivity which we hope compels ecologists to consider that assessments of functional connectivity may be very sensitive to changes in how the landscape is represented and modelled especially at the patch scale even in instances where the landscape scale network measures such as percent linkage srmse or ssi described arguably negligible differences in the models overall the patch scale flow measures and pairwise flow comparisons unique to the sim approach revealed pertinent and invaluable information on how changes to the model affected pairwise relationships and individual patch function these extra levels of information confirmed that for our assessments of connectivity accounting for additional aspects of the environment or dispersal behaviour that may influence functional connectivity provides substantially different conclusions thus we reiterate that patch connections and exchange at the pairwise level can be extremely sensitive to both species characteristics such as dispersal ability and small changes in the interpretation and representation of the landscape and that these sensitivities may be missed by assessments or metrics that are measured at the landscape scale further this type of approach that permits comparison among several different models can help to identify patch relationships that are relatively stable or are sensitive to changes in the representation our approach will be particularly useful when dealing with small and or sensitive populations the absolute counts of flows predicted from the sim allow one to quantify very small changes in immigration in pairwise exchange down to changes in single dispersers when compared to patch incidence metapopulation models or connectivity approaches that rely on binary designations of unoccupied versus occupied to describe patch occupancy and rank the importance or contribution of patches the value of knowing how model predictions change in absolute number of individuals at the patch scale when managing small populations is evident our case study on a small population of kangaroo rats revealed prominent differences in patch relationships and patch function in the network between a connectivity assessment based solely on a habitat selection model versus models that incorporated specific and unique components of dispersal and behaviour for this regional metapopulation the strength and existence of pairwise relationships were not consistent as the connectivity model was changed which highlights the sensitivity and possible unpredictability of this system at the patch scale with respect to modelling connectivity this has important implications for management in this region since habitat restoration and translocations are key directives for species management bender et al 2010 brands 2016 ultimately we suggest that it is presumptuous to assume habitat selection and movement behaviour are equivalent for this network of kangaroo rats and doing so may provide a mistaken understanding of connectivity and patch relationships that could hinder conservation efforts we suggest that a more concerted effort be made to understand dispersal and movement behaviour of this endangered species before conclusions about connectivity are made and used to inform management specifically if empirical data on patch immigration and emigration rates could be collected then the connectivity models presented could be validated to determine what habitat and movement factors are determining functional connectivity for the species in this location we concede that there are other factors that may also affect connectivity that are not currently addressed by our framework in our demonstration and case study our modified models incorporated additional attractiveness and emissivity variables as is without considering that some variables may have a greater influence on connectivity than others e g murphy et al 2010 while not presented here variables in sims can be weighted using constants or can include parameters to model more complex relationships e g an exponential relationship between a variable and connectivity and the weightings of variables can be specified based on known empirical relationships and or biological knowledge e g bossenbroek et al 2001 where these data are lacking variable specification may be explored in more of a sensitivity analysis investigation by testing different weighting schemes and comparing outputs as well specific factors that determine dispersal success such as mortality during dispersal or the influence of density dependence on emigration or immigration to patches are not part of our modelling approach however because these may be described either as patch to patch specific effects or as patch specific traits there may be ways these effects could be incorporated into the sim framework as additional model variables which should be explored further 5 conclusion because of the complex interplay between species movement and landscape heterogeneity and the different ways this manifests as connectivity the effects of assumptions or small changes to a functional connectivity model may be unpredictable or unexpected further these effects can occur at different scales and as we have shown a measure made at one scale may miss or obscure changes to connectivity at other scales that if ignored could have drastic implications for management and conservation especially when assessing small and or sensitive populations a challenge to connectivity modelling is acknowledging that there is a tradeoff between the level of detail incorporated into a model and the robustness and reliability of its results and predictions our sim approach provides a novel solution to help ecologists better understand where uncertainty may exist and thus help to determine when an assessment of functional connectivity may be too simplistic and may need to account for additional detail regarding behaviour and movement within the matrix abrahms et al 2016 we firmly believe in species and context dependency when considering functional connectivity betts et al 2015 and maintain that the integration and application of sims for assessing connectivity provides a promising approach to addressing these dependencies and the limitations associated with current commonly applied approaches acknowledgements this work was supported by funding from alberta innovates technology futures alberta

25203,the production of co2 during sediment decomposition in field and laboratory incubations is often reported to be higher than that of ch4 we present a mathematical description of cellulose conversion into methane and carbon dioxide in the anoxic sediments of tropical ladario and belmont lakes which were investigated before the processes of anaerobic respiration and acidogenesis competing for cellulose monomer as well as the processes of anaerobic respiration acetoclastic methanogenesis and syntrophic acetate oxidation competing for acetate are considered the gaseous and dissolved h2 co2 and ch4 are taken into account in dynamic equations for total 12c 13c and 13c carbon in ch4 and co2 considering the amounts of ch4 and co2 produced during the batch tests and changes in their carbon isotope values modelling based on balances of summary total 12c 13c and 13c carbon is used to adequately describe the experimental data on sediment methanization the high co2 ch4 ratio with a delay in methane production observed in the batch experiments is interpreted by the model as due to an initial fe3 reduction the model is validated by describing the system s dynamics under strong inhibition of acetoclastic methanogenesis by methyl fluoride for comparison the model is used to show a standard pathway of cellulose methanization in the tropical anzol de ouro lake with a 1 1 ratio of produced co2 to ch4 in conditions in which anaerobic respiration was proved to be insignificant keywords anaerobic respiration kinetic isotope effect sediment methanization syntrophic acetate oxidation summary total and heavier carbon balances tropical lakes 1 introduction methane is the second most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide smith et al 2003 methane is formed as a result of a vital activity of methanogenic archeas which in anaerobic conditions complete the process of decay of organic matter the resulting methane is oxidized by methanotrophic microorganisms and its oxidation occurs both under aerobic and anaerobic conditions reducing the emission of methane into the atmosphere borrel et al 2011 kallistova et al 2017 the most widespread biodegradable organic material in the earth is cellulose lynd et al 2002 the formation of ch4 and co2 from cellulosic material c6h10o5 n is catalyzed by several types of microorganisms which participate in depolymerization hydrolysis enzymatic acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the major products of enzymatic acidogenesis of cellulose are monosaccharides which are then transformed into volatile fatty acids vfa such as acetate ch3cooh hydrogen h2 and carbondioxide co2 1 c 6 h 10 o 5 3 h 2 o 2c h 3 cooh 2c o 2 4 h 2 adding the common stoichiometric equations of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis to the eq 1 of monosaccharide transformation we obtain that during cellulose methanization ch4 and co2 are produced in equal molar amounts 1 1 2 c 6 h 10 o 5 h 2 o 3 c h 4 3 c o 2 the dynamics of isotopic incorporation isotope mixing models problem of routing and trophic discrimination factors remain central to isotopic ecology fry 2012 the unified approach describing the dynamics of isotope fractionation in microbial substrate transformation was suggested by vavilin et al 2017 since the concentrations of components with the heavier isotope in the substrate s intermediates i products p and biomasses b are much smaller than those with the lighter isotope the fractionation equation can be written as 3 d q h d t 1 α q h q d q d t where q q l q h q l q l and q h are the component concentrations with the total lighter and heavier isotopes respectively from 1 it follows that the concentration change in the substrate with the heavier isotope is proportional to the change in the total substrate concentration using the equations for total and 13c carbon in cellulose acetate ch4 and co2 it was demonstrated that syntrophic acetate oxidation becomes important during methane formation in sediments of tropical lakes at 25 c the model showed that in the simulated three brazilian lakes vavilin et al 2017 ch4 and co2 are produced in equivalent amounts 1 1 it was reported that dynamic changes in the concentration of 13c contained in all components allowed the pathway of cellulose degradation to be specified meanwhile co2 production during peat decomposition in field and laboratory incubations is often reported to be higher than that of ch4 production corbett et al 2013 according to chanton et al 2008 co2 and ch4 in fens originate primarily from dissolved organic matter whereas in bogs co2 and ch4 come from combination of the dissolved organic matter and the bulk peat the importance of inorganic and organic terminal electron acceptors teas in anaerobic respiration is an explanation of the high co2 ch4 ratios while another potential explanation of this ratio being high is the buildup of fermentation byproducts bridgham et al 2013 humic substances may act as organic teas in wetland ecosystems neither sulphate reduction nor methanogenesis can be the predominant pathways of the metabolism of organic substances until the microbiologically reduced ferric oxide is depleted since iron reducing microorganisms are able to displace sulphate reducing bacteria and methanogenic archaea in competition for organic substrates lovley and philips 1989 lovley 1991 lovley et al 1996 2004 a high co2 ch4 ratio with a delay in methane production was observed also in sediments of a few tropical lakes conrad et al 2011 the purpose of this study is to describe mathematically a pathway of methane formation from sediments of these tropical lakes where measurements of dynamics of the production of gaseous volumes of ch4 and co2 and their isotopic signatures were performed it is considered in the model that during cellulose methanization the processes of anaerobic respiration and acidogenesis compete for cellulose monomer as the substrate as well as anaerobic respiration acetoclastic methanogenesis and acetate oxidation compete for acetate as the substrate giving the high co2 ch4 ratio with a delay in methane production thus the high co2 ch4 ratio is interpreted by the model as being due to a dominant initial anaerobic respiration for that fe3 reduction is assumed 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the batch experiments a detailed description of experiments has been presented elsewhere conrad et al 2011 samples of sediments were taken from floodplain lakes of the amazon and pantanal regions in brazil sediment cores were taken and the upper 0 3 cm of sediments were used in batch experiments at 25 c gas samples were taken from the incubated bottles and analyzed for co2 ch4 δ 13 c o 2 and δ 13 c h 4 at the end of incubation the bottles were used for sampling of the liquid phase which was analyzed for acetate and other vfa during sediment incubations propionate and other vfa were also detected conrad et al 2011 but only in the presence of ch3f which inhibits acetoclastic methanogenesis and in concentrations much less than that of acetate we simulated the experimental data from sediments of the lakes ladario belmont and anzol de ouro water temperature over the sediments of lakes was 31 c about 9 ml aliquots of the sediments were transferred into 27 ml sterile tubes and incubated anaerobically at 25 c 2 2

as the substrates acidogenesis with dissolved cellulose monomer as the substrate acetate oxidation and acetoclastic methanogenesis with acetate as the substrate and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis with dissolved hydrogen and carbon dioxide as the substrates gaseous and soluble h2 co2 and ch4 are considered in general the model used in this paper is similar to the model presented earlier by vavilin et al 2017 however here instead of a combined process of hydrolysis acidogenesis we describe separately the processes of cellulose depolimerization acidogenesis of cellulose monomer and anaerobic respiration with fe3 reduction using cellulose monomer and acetate as the organic substrates the following stoichiometric chemical reactions involving microbial biomass are used for

now it is a huge problem in the calibration of a complex non linear model to find the global minimum instead of generally finding local ones razavi and gupta 2015 in our case we divided the calibration process into two parts first calibration was performed for non isotopic data ch4 and co2 dynamic curves second the isotopic data 13c dynamic changes in ch4 and co2 were used in the

because of the intensive biomass growth of aceticlastic methanogens acetate oxidizers and hydrogenotrophic methanogens respectively fig 2e initially dissolved carbon dioxide quickly transfers into the gas phase fig 2g further co2 production follows syntrophic acetate oxidation and acetoclastic methanogenesis fig 2e the total amount of produced methane is significantly less than that of carbon dioxide fig 2g the start of methane production fig 2g coincides with the end of fe3 reduction fig 2a and the development of hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis fig 2e for the incubation time the ratio of produced ch4 and co2 reaches only slightly higher than 0 5 fig 2d at the end of incubation hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis dominates over acetoclastic methanogenesis fig 2i in the model table 1 the carbon isotope fractionation factor for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is taken high α h 2 c o 2 1 05 while that for acetoclastic methanogenesis is assumed to be much less and equal to 1 005 penning et al 2006 conrad and klose 2011 as cellulose is the substrate δ c 13 in cellulose increases over time fig 2h in accordance with the dynamic model the summary total c c 12 c 13 and c 13 are constant during methanization of cellulose in spite of c 13 redistribution between substrate intermediates and products not shown in accordance with the model methane is produced from h2 co2 and ch3cooh initially methane production from ladario lake sediments is very low due to the low concentration of methanogenic populations however the isotope signature in methane changes from the start of incubation because anaerobic respiration has some influence on the system dynamics from the beginning of experiment 0 12 days after the 15th day the δ c 13 h 4 value changes due to the development of comparative inputs of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis fig 2h a c all in all carbon isotope signature dynamics may reflect the dominance of different parallel processes in an anaerobic system similar to vavilin 2012 the inhibition of acetate and h2 co2 consumption by methyl fluoride ch3f is incorporated into the dynamic model to account for the effect of ch3f on the cellulose degradation process it was confirmed that in the presence of ch3f the amount of produced co2 was much greater than that of ch4 fig 3 g the inhibition of microorganism activity by ch3f is described in the model assuming an exponential decrease of maximal substrate consumption rate over time 13 ρ m ρ m exp k t where ρ m is the maximal rate of substrate consumption k is a constant equal to 1 0 0 1 0 1 and 0 1 d 1 for acetoclastic methanogenesis anaerobic respiration acetate oxidation and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis respectively these values of k were obtained as a result of additional calibration of the model while all other parameters and initial values remained the same as in the model without addition of ch3f however we increased the value of the carbon isotope fractionation factor α for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis from 1 05 to 1 065 fig 3f ch3f has been frequently used as a specific inhibitor for acetoclastic methanogenesis conrad 2005 it has been validated for pure cultures janssen and frenzel 1997 as well as for mixed cultures of rice fields and lake sediments conrad and klose 1999 penning and conrad 2007 in accordance with janssen and frenzel 1997 the model thus demonstrates a strong inhibition of acetoclastic methanogenesis while acetate oxidation and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis are inhibited much less the exponential decrease of maximal substrate consumption rate over time may be interpreted as due to biodegradation of ch3f conrad and klose 1999 in accordance with the model at the end of simulation acetate and dissolved hydrogen concentrations significantly increase fig 3a c in the presence of ch3f soon after the beginning of incubation hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis absolutely dominates over acetoclastic methanogenesis fig 3i 3 2 sediment methanization in belmont lake fig 4 shows system dynamics in the sediment of belmont lake the key model parameters and initial concentrations of microorganisms are summarized in table 1 in contrast to ladario lake fig 2g b from the start of incubation anaerobic respiration is not totally dominating over acidogenesis fig 4e b because of the comparatively high initial biomass concentrations of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens and acetate oxidizers fig 4e during incubation acetate and dissolved hydrogen concentrations are much lower in belmont lake than in ladario lake compare figs 4a c and 2a c similarly to ladario lake the initially dissolved carbon dioxide is quickly transferred to the gas phase fig 4g further co2 production follows anaerobic respiration and the development of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and syntrophic acetate oxidation fig 4b e g methane production begins since the start of incubation fig 4g d the total amount of produced methane is less than that of carbon dioxide fig 4g but at the end of incubation time the ratio of produced ch4 to co2 increases to a value much higher than 0 5 fig 4d which was also reported for ladario lake fig 2d throughout incubation hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis dominates over acetoclastic methanogenesis fig 4i in accordance with the dynamic model the summary total c c 12 c 13 and c 13 are constant during methanization of cellulose in spite of c 13 redistribution between substrate intermediates and products not shown 3 3 sediment methanization in anzol de ouro lake fig 5 shows system dynamics in the sediment of anzol de ouro lake the key model parameters and initial concentrations of microorganisms are summarized in table 1 in contrast to ladario and belmont lakes the model shows a standard pathway of cellulose methanization in the tropical anzol de ouro lake with a ratio of produced co2 to ch4 of 1 1 where anaerobic respiration is proved to be insignificant the model shows also that syntrophic acetate oxidation is of crucial importance in sediment methanization of all tropical lakes ladario belmont and anzol de ouro 3 4 competition of fe3 reducers and acidogens for cellulose monomer it is commonly accepted that the acidogenesis of glucose should also be a quick process batstone et al 2002 anaerobic respiration should also be a quick process to compete with acidogens for cellulose monomer as the common substrate the specific maximum biomass growth rate coefficients of acidogens and fe3 reducers used in the model are shown in table 1 fig 6 shows the ratio of the consumption rates of cellulose monomer during anaerobic respiration and acidogenesis in ladario belmont and anzol de ouro lakes in accordance with the model in the initial period from the 0th to about the 12th day the process of anaerobic respiration absolutely dominates over the process of acidogenesis in ladario lake after the 12th day the process of anaerobic respiration becomes insignificant in belmont lake during first 4 5 days the rates of anaerobic respiration and acidogenesis are comparable in anzol de ouro lake in contrast during all incubation time anaerobic respiration is insignificant in accordance with function 8 the rate of fe3 reduction depends on the concentrations of fe3 cellulose monomer or acetate and the biomass of fe3 reducers it depends also on the maximum specific rate of organic matter conversion during anaerobic respiration anaerobic fe3 reduction exclusively with acetate not cellulose could not describe the system dynamics well methane emissions from shallow sediments contribute a major part of methane emissions from freshwater lakes bastviken 2009 in ladario lake simulated in our study the high fe3 concentration may cause the low methane production during sediment incubations recently schilder et al 2017 measuring δ c 13 values of the examined invertebrate biological groups that can incorporate ch4 derived carbon reported that a contribution of biogenic methane production depends on the trophic status of the lake eutrophication of the lake with increasing nutrient loading increases the contribution of biogenic methane in contrast to deutrophication with decreasing nutrient loading and increasing oxygen concentration 4 concluding remarks modelling showed that at the beginning the processes of anaerobic respiration fe3 reduction and acidogenesis compete for cellulose monomer as a common substrate in ladario and belmont lakes the high co2 ch4 ratio with a delay in methane production observed in the batch experiments was interpreted by the model as being due to the dominance of initial anaerobic respiration anaerobic respiration was insignificant in anzol de ouro lake similarly to vavilin et al 2017 the model showed that syntrophic acetate oxidation is of crucial importance in sediment methanization of the investigated tropical lakes the model confirmed that in the presence of ch3f the amount of produced co2 was much greater than that of ch4 a strong inhibition of acetoclastic methanogenesis was demonstrated while the inhibition of anaerobic respiration acetate

25203,the production of co2 during sediment decomposition in field and laboratory incubations is often reported to be higher than that of ch4 we present a mathematical description of cellulose conversion into methane and carbon dioxide in the anoxic sediments of tropical ladario and belmont lakes which were investigated before the processes of anaerobic respiration and acidogenesis competing for cellulose monomer as well as the processes of anaerobic respiration acetoclastic methanogenesis and syntrophic acetate oxidation competing for acetate are considered the gaseous and dissolved h2 co2 and ch4 are taken into account in dynamic equations for total 12c 13c and 13c carbon in ch4 and co2 considering the amounts of ch4 and co2 produced during the batch tests and changes in their carbon isotope values modelling based on balances of summary total 12c 13c and 13c carbon is used to adequately describe the experimental data on sediment methanization the high co2 ch4 ratio with a delay in methane production observed in the batch experiments is interpreted by the model as due to an initial fe3 reduction the model is validated by describing the system s dynamics under strong inhibition of acetoclastic methanogenesis by methyl fluoride for comparison the model is used to show a standard pathway of cellulose methanization in the tropical anzol de ouro lake with a 1 1 ratio of produced co2 to ch4 in conditions in which anaerobic respiration was proved to be insignificant keywords anaerobic respiration kinetic isotope effect sediment methanization syntrophic acetate oxidation summary total and heavier carbon balances tropical lakes 1 introduction methane is the second most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide smith et al 2003 methane is formed as a result of a vital activity of methanogenic archeas which in anaerobic conditions complete the process of decay of organic matter the resulting methane is oxidized by methanotrophic microorganisms and its oxidation occurs both under aerobic and anaerobic conditions reducing the emission of methane into the atmosphere borrel et al 2011 kallistova et al 2017 the most widespread biodegradable organic material in the earth is cellulose lynd et al 2002 the formation of ch4 and co2 from cellulosic material c6h10o5 n is catalyzed by several types of microorganisms which participate in depolymerization hydrolysis enzymatic acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis the major products of enzymatic acidogenesis of cellulose are monosaccharides which are then transformed into volatile fatty acids vfa such as acetate ch3cooh hydrogen h2 and carbondioxide co2 1 c 6 h 10 o 5 3 h 2 o 2c h 3 cooh 2c o 2 4 h 2 adding the common stoichiometric equations of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis to the eq 1 of monosaccharide transformation we obtain that during cellulose methanization ch4 and co2 are produced in equal molar amounts 1 1 2 c 6 h 10 o 5 h 2 o 3 c h 4 3 c o 2 the dynamics of isotopic incorporation isotope mixing models problem of routing and trophic discrimination factors remain central to isotopic ecology fry 2012 the unified approach describing the dynamics of isotope fractionation in microbial substrate transformation was suggested by vavilin et al 2017 since the concentrations of components with the heavier isotope in the substrate s intermediates i products p and biomasses b are much smaller than those with the lighter isotope the fractionation equation can be written as 3 d q h d t 1 α q h q d q d t where q q l q h q l q l and q h are the component concentrations with the total lighter and heavier isotopes respectively from 1 it follows that the concentration change in the substrate with the heavier isotope is proportional to the change in the total substrate concentration using the equations for total and 13c carbon in cellulose acetate ch4 and co2 it was demonstrated that syntrophic acetate oxidation becomes important during methane formation in sediments of tropical lakes at 25 c the model showed that in the simulated three brazilian lakes vavilin et al 2017 ch4 and co2 are produced in equivalent amounts 1 1 it was reported that dynamic changes in the concentration of 13c contained in all components allowed the pathway of cellulose degradation to be specified meanwhile co2 production during peat decomposition in field and laboratory incubations is often reported to be higher than that of ch4 production corbett et al 2013 according to chanton et al 2008 co2 and ch4 in fens originate primarily from dissolved organic matter whereas in bogs co2 and ch4 come from combination of the dissolved organic matter and the bulk peat the importance of inorganic and organic terminal electron acceptors teas in anaerobic respiration is an explanation of the high co2 ch4 ratios while another potential explanation of this ratio being high is the buildup of fermentation byproducts bridgham et al 2013 humic substances may act as organic teas in wetland ecosystems neither sulphate reduction nor methanogenesis can be the predominant pathways of the metabolism of organic substances until the microbiologically reduced ferric oxide is depleted since iron reducing microorganisms are able to displace sulphate reducing bacteria and methanogenic archaea in competition for organic substrates lovley and philips 1989 lovley 1991 lovley et al 1996 2004 a high co2 ch4 ratio with a delay in methane production was observed also in sediments of a few tropical lakes conrad et al 2011 the purpose of this study is to describe mathematically a pathway of methane formation from sediments of these tropical lakes where measurements of dynamics of the production of gaseous volumes of ch4 and co2 and their isotopic signatures were performed it is considered in the model that during cellulose methanization the processes of anaerobic respiration and acidogenesis compete for cellulose monomer as the substrate as well as anaerobic respiration acetoclastic methanogenesis and acetate oxidation compete for acetate as the substrate giving the high co2 ch4 ratio with a delay in methane production thus the high co2 ch4 ratio is interpreted by the model as being due to a dominant initial anaerobic respiration for that fe3 reduction is assumed 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the batch experiments a detailed description of experiments has been presented elsewhere conrad et al 2011 samples of sediments were taken from floodplain lakes of the amazon and pantanal regions in brazil sediment cores were taken and the upper 0 3 cm of sediments were used in batch experiments at 25 c gas samples were taken from the incubated bottles and analyzed for co2 ch4 δ 13 c o 2 and δ 13 c h 4 at the end of incubation the bottles were used for sampling of the liquid phase which was analyzed for acetate and other vfa during sediment incubations propionate and other vfa were also detected conrad et al 2011 but only in the presence of ch3f which inhibits acetoclastic methanogenesis and in concentrations much less than that of acetate we simulated the experimental data from sediments of the lakes ladario belmont and anzol de ouro water temperature over the sediments of lakes was 31 c about 9 ml aliquots of the sediments were transferred into 27 ml sterile tubes and incubated anaerobically at 25 c 2 2 model fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of cellulose methanization with separate metabolic steps depolimerization of cellulose polymer anaerobic respiration with dissolved cellulose monomer or acetate as the substrates acidogenesis with dissolved cellulose monomer as the substrate acetate oxidation and acetoclastic methanogenesis with acetate as the substrate and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis with dissolved hydrogen and carbon dioxide as the substrates gaseous and soluble h2 co2 and ch4 are considered in general the model used in this paper is similar to the model presented earlier by vavilin et al 2017 however here instead of a combined process of hydrolysis acidogenesis we describe separately the processes of cellulose depolimerization acidogenesis of cellulose monomer and anaerobic respiration with fe3 reduction using cellulose monomer and acetate as the organic substrates the following stoichiometric chemical reactions involving microbial biomass are used for

the equations in the model published by vavilin et al 2017 in which the gaseous and dissolved h2 co2 and ch4 were taken into account in dynamic equations for total and 13c carbon in ch4 and co2 because of a higher temperature 25 c in the present paper we do not consider such processes as homoacetogenesis the numerical simulations were performed using matlab software mathworks inc 1984 up to now it is a huge problem in the calibration of a complex non linear model to find the global minimum instead of generally finding local ones razavi and gupta 2015 in our case we divided the calibration process into two parts first calibration was performed for non isotopic data ch4 and co2 dynamic curves second the isotopic data 13c dynamic changes in ch4 and co2 were used in the calibration process at the second step to speed up the process of searching for the values of parameters to fit the model to some experimental data ch 4 co 2 δ c 13 h 4 δ c 13 o 2 the model variables with corresponding experimental points were displayed simultaneously on the computer during the simulations a visual comparison of the simulations appearing on computer screen obtained at different values of the parameters is a quick way to find the appropriate values of the parameters the total set of equations is described in the appendix a the carbon isotope signature is calculated as 12 δ q

methanization in ladario lake fig 2 shows system dynamics in the sediment of ladario lake the key model parameters and initial concentrations of microorganisms are summarized in table 1 in accordance with the model acetate concentration starts increasing once fe3 is totally reduced to fe2 fig 2a due to biomass growth of acidogens fig 2b acetate and dissolved hydrogen concentrations fall fig 2a c because of the intensive biomass growth of aceticlastic methanogens acetate oxidizers and hydrogenotrophic methanogens respectively fig 2e initially dissolved carbon dioxide quickly transfers into the gas phase fig 2g further co2 production follows syntrophic acetate oxidation and acetoclastic methanogenesis fig 2e the total amount of produced methane is significantly less than that of carbon dioxide fig 2g the start of methane production fig 2g coincides with the end of fe3 reduction fig 2a and the development of hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis fig 2e for the incubation time the ratio of produced ch4 and co2 reaches only slightly higher than 0 5 fig 2d at the end of incubation hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis dominates over acetoclastic methanogenesis fig 2i in the model table 1 the carbon isotope fractionation factor for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is taken high α h 2 c o 2 1 05 while that for acetoclastic methanogenesis is assumed to be much less and equal to 1 005 penning et al 2006 conrad and klose 2011 as cellulose is the substrate δ c 13 in cellulose increases over time fig 2h in accordance with the dynamic model the summary total c c 12 c 13 and c 13 are constant during methanization of cellulose in spite of c 13 redistribution between substrate intermediates and products not shown in accordance with the model methane is produced from h2 co2 and ch3cooh initially methane production from ladario lake sediments is very low due to the low concentration of methanogenic populations however the isotope signature in methane changes from the start of incubation because anaerobic respiration has some influence on the system dynamics from the beginning of experiment 0 12 days after the 15th day the δ c 13 h 4 value changes due to the development of comparative inputs of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis fig 2h a c all in all carbon isotope signature dynamics may reflect the dominance of different parallel processes in an anaerobic system similar to vavilin 2012 the inhibition of acetate and h2 co2 consumption by methyl fluoride ch3f is incorporated into the dynamic model to account for the effect of ch3f on the cellulose degradation process it was confirmed that in the presence of ch3f the amount of produced co2 was much greater than that of ch4 fig 3 g the inhibition of microorganism activity by ch3f is described in the model assuming an exponential decrease of maximal substrate consumption rate over time 13 ρ m ρ m exp k t where ρ m is the maximal rate of substrate consumption k is a constant equal to 1 0 0 1 0 1 and 0 1 d 1 for acetoclastic methanogenesis anaerobic respiration acetate oxidation and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis respectively these values of k were obtained as a result of additional calibration of the model while all other parameters and initial values remained the same as in the model without addition of ch3f however we increased the value of the carbon isotope fractionation factor α for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis from 1 05 to 1 065 fig 3f ch3f has been frequently used as a specific inhibitor for acetoclastic methanogenesis conrad 2005 it has been validated for pure cultures janssen and frenzel 1997 as well as for mixed cultures of rice fields and lake sediments conrad and klose 1999 penning and conrad 2007 in accordance with janssen and frenzel 1997 the model thus demonstrates a strong inhibition of acetoclastic methanogenesis while acetate oxidation and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis are inhibited much less the exponential decrease of maximal substrate consumption rate over time may be interpreted as due to biodegradation of ch3f conrad and klose 1999 in accordance with the model at the end of simulation acetate and dissolved hydrogen concentrations significantly increase fig 3a c in the presence of ch3f soon after the beginning of incubation hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis absolutely dominates over acetoclastic methanogenesis fig 3i 3 2 sediment methanization in belmont lake fig 4 shows system dynamics in the sediment of belmont lake the key model parameters and initial concentrations of microorganisms are summarized in table 1 in contrast to ladario lake fig 2g b from the start of incubation anaerobic respiration is not totally dominating over acidogenesis fig 4e b because of the comparatively high initial biomass concentrations of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens and acetate oxidizers fig 4e during incubation acetate and dissolved hydrogen concentrations are much lower in belmont lake than in ladario lake compare figs 4a c and 2a c similarly to ladario lake the initially dissolved carbon dioxide is quickly transferred to the gas phase fig 4g further co2 production follows anaerobic respiration and the development of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and syntrophic acetate oxidation fig 4b e g methane production begins since the start of incubation fig 4g d the total amount of produced methane is less than that of carbon dioxide fig 4g but at the end of incubation time the ratio of produced ch4 to co2 increases to a value much higher than 0 5 fig 4d which was also reported for ladario lake fig 2d throughout incubation hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis dominates over acetoclastic methanogenesis fig 4i in accordance with the dynamic model the summary total c c 12 c 13 and c 13 are constant during methanization of cellulose in spite of c 13 redistribution between substrate intermediates and products not shown 3 3 sediment methanization in anzol de ouro lake fig 5 shows system dynamics in the sediment of anzol de ouro lake the key model parameters and initial concentrations of microorganisms are summarized in table 1 in contrast to ladario and belmont lakes the model shows a standard pathway of cellulose methanization in the tropical anzol de ouro lake with a ratio of produced co2 to ch4 of 1 1 where anaerobic respiration is proved to be insignificant the model shows also that syntrophic acetate oxidation is of crucial importance in sediment methanization of all tropical lakes ladario belmont and anzol de ouro 3 4 competition of fe3 reducers and acidogens for cellulose monomer it is commonly accepted that the acidogenesis of glucose should also be a quick process batstone et al 2002 anaerobic respiration should also be a quick process to compete with acidogens for cellulose monomer as the common substrate the specific maximum biomass growth rate coefficients of acidogens and fe3 reducers used in the model are shown in table 1 fig 6 shows the ratio of the consumption rates of cellulose monomer during anaerobic respiration and acidogenesis in ladario belmont and anzol de ouro lakes in accordance with the model in the initial period from the 0th to about the 12th day the process of anaerobic respiration absolutely dominates over the process of acidogenesis in ladario lake after the 12th day the process of anaerobic respiration becomes insignificant in belmont lake during first 4 5 days the rates of anaerobic respiration and acidogenesis are comparable in anzol de ouro lake in contrast during all incubation time anaerobic respiration is insignificant in accordance with function 8 the rate of fe3 reduction depends on the concentrations of fe3 cellulose monomer or acetate and the biomass of fe3 reducers it depends also on the maximum specific rate of organic matter conversion during anaerobic respiration anaerobic fe3 reduction exclusively with acetate not cellulose could not describe the system dynamics well methane emissions from shallow sediments contribute a major part of methane emissions from freshwater lakes bastviken 2009 in ladario lake simulated in our study the high fe3 concentration may cause the low methane production during sediment incubations recently schilder et al 2017 measuring δ c 13 values of the examined invertebrate biological groups that can incorporate ch4 derived carbon reported that a contribution of biogenic methane production depends on the trophic status of the lake eutrophication of the lake with increasing nutrient loading increases the contribution of biogenic methane in contrast to deutrophication with decreasing nutrient loading and increasing oxygen concentration 4 concluding remarks modelling showed that at the beginning the processes of anaerobic respiration fe3 reduction and acidogenesis compete for cellulose monomer as a common substrate in ladario and belmont lakes the high co2 ch4 ratio with a delay in methane production observed in the batch experiments was interpreted by the model as being due to the dominance of initial anaerobic respiration anaerobic respiration was insignificant in anzol de ouro lake similarly to vavilin et al 2017 the model showed that syntrophic acetate oxidation is of crucial importance in sediment methanization of the investigated tropical lakes the model confirmed that in the presence of ch3f the amount of produced co2 was much greater than that of ch4 a strong inhibition of acetoclastic methanogenesis was demonstrated while the inhibition of anaerobic respiration acetate oxidation and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was much less acknowledgement the authors were supported by a grant from the russian science foundation project 17 17 01204 appendix a description of the

25204,lakes are active processors of organic carbon oc and play important roles in landscape and global carbon cycling allochthonous oc loads from the landscape along with autochthonous oc loads from primary production are mineralized in lakes buried in lake sediments and exported via surface or groundwater outflows although these processes provide a basis for a conceptual understanding of lake oc budgets few studies have integrated these fluxes under a dynamic modeling framework to examine their interactions and relative magnitudes we developed a simple dynamic mass balance model for oc and applied the model to a set of five lakes we examined the relative magnitudes of oc fluxes and found that long term 10 year lake oc dynamics were predominantly driven by allochthonous loads in four of the five lakes underscoring the importance of terrestrially derived oc in northern lake ecosystems our model highlighted seasonal patterns in lake oc budgets with increasing water temperatures and lake productivity throughout the growing season corresponding to a transition from burial to respiration dominated oc fates ratios of respiration to burial however were also mediated by the source autochthonous vs allochthonous of total oc loads autochthonous oc is more readily respired and may therefore proportionally reduce burial under a warming climate but allochthonous oc may increase burial due to changes in precipitation the ratios of autochthonous to allochthonous inputs and respiration to burial demonstrate the importance of dynamic models for examining both the seasonal and inter annual roles of lakes in landscape and global carbon cycling particularly in a global change context finally we highlighted critical data needs which include surface water doc observations in paired tributary and lake systems measurements of oc burial rates groundwater input volume and doc and budgets of particulate oc keywords carbon cycle mass balance dissolved organic carbon particulate organic carbon lter gleon 1 introduction lakes are dynamic components of the landscape that actively process store and transport terrestrially derived organic carbon oc cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 tanentzap et al 2017 as well as emit inorganic carbon to the atmosphere arvola et al 2002 raymond et al 2013 weyhenmeyer et al 2015 making them important in global carbon c cycling owing to few ecosystem scale studies that fully balance oc budgets cole et al 1989 hanson et al 2014 2015 there remains a considerable knowledge gap in lake oc dynamics and thus in fully understanding the role of lakes in the global c cycle global estimates of co2 emissions i e evasion from lakes and reservoirs are 0 32 pg petagrams c yr 1 raymond et al 2013 whereas anywhere from 0 02 0 07 pg c yr 1 tranvik et al 2009 to 0 06 0 25 pg c yr 1 are stored in sediments mendonça et al 2017 these estimates however are highly uncertain and models that dynamically account for major oc fluxes and storage terms in lakes and that explore uncertainties around those terms are needed to advance our understanding of lake oc cycling and their contribution to global c budgets hanson et al 2015 reed et al 2018 existing mass balance models are generally based on low spatio temporal frequency data confined to single lakes and are often from boreal regions jonsson et al 2001 urban et al 2005 andersson and sobek 2006 cremona et al 2014 in a first step in overcoming some of these limitations we developed and applied a dynamic mass balance model to examine the relative magnitudes of oc fluxes across a set of five lakes with whole ecosystem oc budget data our goal was to build a simple oc model that could be applied in a range of lake ecosystems to capture seasonal and annual variation in oc concentrations 1 1 overview of concepts of key oc fluxes in lake ecosystems for lakes the term mass balance has been broadly used to quantify carbon or nutrient budgets as the combination of inputs outputs and changes to standing stocks in the water column and sediments pace and lovett 2013 inputs to lake ecosystem oc budgets are the sum of allochthonous externally derived dissolved doc and particulate oc poc inflows from surface and groundwater sources atmospheric deposition via precipitation dry deposits and litterfall and autochthonous internally derived doc and poc kawasaki and benner 2006 and phytoplanktonic primary production outputs from the oc pool reflect mechanisms that mineralize i e photo oxidation and respiration and export oc via surface and groundwater outflows here for simplicity all mineralization processes that convert oc to co2 are collectively modeled as respiration the mass change in oc in the water column and lake sediments is considered as change in storage outputs and storage are the fates of oc loads and their balances define the role of lakes in broader c cycling box 1 fig 1 at the global scale lakes are thought to be net sources of c to the atmosphere based on the mean co2 kortelainen et al 2006 tranvik et al 2009 raymond et al 2013 and methane bastviken et al 2011 concentrations at higher than atmospheric levels in lake surface waters oc export is less frequently considered but equally important in terms of the quality and quantity of oc ultimately reaching the ocean via tributaries raymond and bauer 2001 santoso et al 2017 because lakes store oc in sediments they can also act as sinks in the global c cycle mulholland and elwood 1982 dillon and molot 1997 einsele et al 2001 einola et al 2011 we synthesized existing knowledge of lake oc budgets into a model that integrates these important mechanisms including both in lake as well as external i e watershed processes fig 1 below we described these processes in three main categories of the dominant processes that influence long term lake oc budgets 1 allochthonous inputs 2 autochthonous inputs and 3 storage and export 1 2 allochthonous inputs allochthonous inputs include all externally derived oc including terrestrial doc and poc from surface and groundwater inflows litterfall and direct fall precipitation box 1 although surface water inflows regularly deliver doc to lake ecosystems the uncertainties around their sources and magnitudes are perhaps the most commonly overlooked aspect in oc budgets largely owing to data limitations hanson et al 2015 duffy et al 2018 prior studies have included direct measurements of inflow stream concentrations of doc when available schindler et al 1997 jonsson et al 2001 urban et al 2005 klump et al 2009 but other approaches have included literature derived input estimates striegl and michmerhuizen 1998 equations based on watershed area sobek et al 2006 watershed wetland area ratios o connor et al 2009 precipitation hanson et al 2004 staehr et al 2010 or gis based estimates based on land cover and distance weighted hydrological flow paths canham et al 2004 in lakes without surface inflows including closed basin and seepage lakes groundwater can be the dominant hydrological input e g gaiser et al 2009 and can deliver doc to lakes especially in organic rich soils schindler and krabbenhoft 1998 empirical measurements of groundwater discharge and doc concentration however are rare and difficult to estimate hanson et al 2014 poc inputs from litterfall and wet and dry atmospheric deposition are typically small and are generally estimated as a function of lake size and literature or expert based loading coefficients hanson et al 2004 1 3 autochthonous inputs autochthonous doc and poc originate within lakes through bacterial exudates and photosynthesis by primary producers since gross primary production gpp is difficult to measure at the ecosystem level net primary production npp considered the difference between gpp and autotrophic respiration is measured instead pace and lovett 2013 box 1 approaches to estimate npp include bottle incubations urban 2005 yang et al 2008 and high frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen or co2 concentrations cole et al 2002 staehr et al 2010 statistical relationships have also been developed to estimate npp from lake temperature and total phosphorus tp hanson et al 2004 chlorophyll a chl a jonsson et al 2001 ramlal et al 2003 or static proportions of the overall oc pool åberg et al 2004 1 4 storage and export long term burial of poc in lake sediments is the mechanism by which lakes remove c from the global c cycle and is therefore a critical component of our understanding of the fate of both allochthonous and autochthonous

surface or groundwater cole et al 1984 exports represent allochthonous inputs to downstream aquatic ecosystems and therefore contribute to landscape c cycling kling et al 2000 1 5 objective and research question our broad objectives were 1 to quantify long term i e 10 year dynamics and magnitudes of doc fluxes through the development of a simple dynamic model and 2 to use this model to reveal the dynamics of dominant drivers of oc fates allochthonous vs autochtonous load and burial vs respiration we applied the model to five lakes that encompass contrasts in morphology hydrology and trophic state to understand the relative influence of these lake characteristics on oc cycling and to address our overarching research question what are the magnitudes and uncertainties in processes governing lake oc cycling and how do these change through time 2 methods 2 1 study lakes and data sources we modeled temporal dynamics of oc budgets for five lakes that span a range of limnological characteristics e g hydrologic residence time depth trophic state table 1 lakes were selected based on contrasting characteristics and availability of observational data required observational data included precipitation hydrological inflow discharge inflow doc concentration and various in lake measurements surface water temperature chl a concentration and secchi depth all lakes had a minimum of 10 years of limnological data used for model training and at least four years of in lake doc and do measurements for model validation see the appendix for detailed data descriptions and sources supplementary material our dataset included four oligotrophic lakes and one eutrophic lake lake areas ranged from 71 38 ha to 565 000 ha and mean depths ranged from 7 m to 27 m hydrologic residence times ranged from 0 8 years to 6 3 years in lake mean annual doc concentrations ranged from 3 g m 3 to 6 g m 3 watersheds are primarily forested for harp lake trout lake and lake vänern whereas toolik lake is in a tundra dominated watershed and monona is in an agricultural and heavily developed watershed 2 2 general model approach we developed a relatively simple dynamic mass balance model fig 1 tables 2 and 3 that included four state variables representing oc table 3 eqs 1 4 and one representing dissolved oxygen do eq 5 literature based and calibrated parameters for the equations are in table 2 we used literature based parameters for processes generally described in previous studies and when lake specific information was unavailable and to prevent overfitting of the model allochthonous doc and poc eqs 1 2 for the lakes were modeled separately from autochthonous doc and poc eqs 3 4 model complexity was commensurate with the number of observational variables available we operated the model on a daily time step for 10 13 years based on data availability as all five lakes are drainage lakes with outlet streams lake levels are relatively stable from 1995 to 2017 trout lake varied 0 5 m and lake monona varied 1 m n lottig personal communication lake vänern varied 1 m from 2003 to 2009 tongal and berndtsson 2014 lake level and therefore volume was assumed static over the modeling period inflow discharge at a daily time step was available for all study lakes doc concentration of inflows was available at weekly or biweekly intervals to model inflow doc at a daily time step we used the loadflex package in r to fit stream load models for each system appling et al 2015 we first fit a regression model for each lake which was then incorporated in a composite method which uses model residuals from the regression model to adjust predictions based on observed data aulenbach 2013 kelly et al 2018 after testing the nine available regression models model 9 was used for all lakes except trout lake where model 4 returned the best fit see kelly et al 2018 for full regression model equations when inflow doc concentrations were not available for all tributaries doc was scaled to equal total inflow volume observational data of in lake chl a secchi depth and temperature were available weekly or bi weekly and were linearly interpolated to a daily time step precipitation was assumed zero for missing dates however precipitation data gaps were rare to account for the absence of winter data at toolik we set inflow doc to 0 when the main inflow toolik inlet was frozen supplementary material the model was written and executed in r version 3 3 2 r core team 2016 model code and data are available here https github com gleon sos 2 3 allochthonous doc and poc

leaching burial and export pocalloch eq 2 allochthonous poc input ipoc eq 2 1 was modeled as a proportion of idoc cpocfactor deposition dpoc eq 2 2 was the sum of canopy dpoccanopy and wetland dpocwetland inputs where dpoccanopy eq 2 21 was the product of the proportion of lake perimeter that is canopy pcanopy a parameter representing a transfer coefficient cpocaerial of poc from the canopy to the lake and lakeperimeter dpocwetland eq 2 22 was assumed to scale with ddocwetland by the proportion cpocfactor pocalloch had a burial fate balloch eq 2 3 calculated as the product of a burial coefficient bpocalloch and pocalloch as with docalloch downstream export epocalloch eq 2 4 was included as the product of pocalloch and outflow daily precipitation qprecip mm was based on measurements from the weather station nearest to each lake the concentration of doc in precipitation was set to 2 g m 3 hanson et al 2014 time series of lake specific groundwater inflow volume m3 and doc concentration g m 3 were not available we estimated the proportion of inflow as groundwater in our study lakes based on literature values when available but assumed no groundwater in the absence of data supplementary material resulting estimated groundwater proportions were 0 for all lakes except trout lake which we estimated at 19 hanson et al 2014 groundwater doc concentration was assumed to be 10 g m 3 table 2 docgwconc hanson et al 2014 shoreline adjacent wetlands and forests were estimated from publicly available spatial datasets supplementary material we focused on wetlands adjacent to the shoreline because they contribute most of wetland derived doc to lakes not already captured in eq 1 1 hanson et al 2014 to account for potential misalignment among spatial wetland and forest data and lake boundaries we defined adjacency as within 30 m of lake boundaries 2 4 autochthonous doc and poc our approach to modeling autochthonous inputs table 3 eqs 3 4 was generally similar to that of allochthonous inputs for leaching mineralization export and burial eqs 3 3 3 5 4 2 4 3 but differed in the input terms nppdoc eq 3 2 and npppoc eq 4 1 total autochthonous inputs npptot eq 3 1 were the product of gpp which was modeled as a function of chl a μg l 1 mixing depth zmix set to half of photic depth m and surface water temperature t c per morin et al 1999 and the proportion of gpp not respired by autotrophs 1 rautotroph the gpp function was calculated using observed temperature and chl a data that ranged from 5 to 25 c and 1 1000 mg m 2 respectively across all lakes since models of gpp are not well constrained at low temperatures we set gpp to zero if surface water temperatures were 4 c chl a concentrations were converted from volumetric to areal units by multiplying by photic depth which was estimated from secchi depth m wetzel 2001 the doc fraction of total npp nppdoc was calculated using the pace and prairie 2005 negative exponential equation eq 3 2 the remainder of npptot was attributed to poc npppoc eq 4 1 water column dissolved oxygen do was used to constrain net ecosystem production nepoc eq 5 1 under the assumption that at short time scales and under pseudo equilibrium conditions atmospheric exchange fatm approximated nepoc fatm eq 5 2 was calculated as a function of piston velocity k set to 0 7 m d 1 with no wind speed data this is a conservative estimate do and do saturation and mixing depth zmix the saturation of do dosat is temperature dependent and was determined using the garcia benson method in the lakemetabolizer r package

the photic zone and two calibrated parameters rdocautoch and rdocalloch tables 2 and 3 eqs 1 4 3 4 5 12 see model calibration and uncertainty analysis we determined epilimnion temperature by averaging observed temperatures throughout the photic zone when data were available from multiple depths but otherwise used surface temperature supplementary material 2 5 model calibration and uncertainty analysis the collinearity of the four free parameters in the model respiration rdocalloch rdocautoch burial bpocalloch and bpocautoch table 2 was tested using the collin function in the r package fme soetaert and petzoldt 2010 in general when the collinearity index is less than 20 linear independence is assumed brun et al 2001 omlin et al 2001 finding low collinearity the four parameters were fit by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals of doc and do do residuals were weighted 0 25 that of doc and the total number of residuals was equally weighted between do and doc the model was fit using a pseudo random search algorithm in the fme package burial parameters were constrained in the model as a proportion between 0 no burial of poc and 1 all poc is buried rdocalloch was constrained between 0 0003 and 0 03 d 1 based on the range of oc decomposition rates for inland waters with residence times between 1 10 years presented in catalán et al 2016 rdocautoch was constrained between 0 003 and 0 3 d 1 hanson et al 2004 goodness of fit was evaluated with root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse scores calculated for doc and do for each lake using the hydrogof r package zambrano bigiarini 2017 goodness of fits were reported for doc and do because the model was fit to both simultaneously rather than individually a sensitivity analysis of each parameter was conducted by allowing the parameter to vary at 100 different values within the set bounds while fixing the other three parameters at their calibrated values we estimated parameter means and uncertainties using a bootstrapping routine per dugan et al 2017 using the bootstrapped parameters we calculated residual errors between observed and modeled doc and do we created 100 pseudo observational datasets by randomizing these residuals 100 times and adding each randomized residual set to the observed data we then re fit the parameters to the pseudo observational datasets to provide 100 new parameter estimates finally we recorded parameter distribution characteristics and assessed correlations among parameters within each lake 3 results 3 1 model performance parameter estimates and sensitivity analysis modeled doc and do generally followed observed temporal patterns across years in each study lake fig 2 the rmse of the model fits for doc and do were below 0 6 mg l 1 and 1 7 mg l 1 respectively table 4 the nse metric reveals if the modeled results are more accurate nse 0 than the long term mean nse reveals strong model fits for lake monona and vänern for both doc and do table 4 trout lake and harp lake had poor fits for doc nse 0 and toolik and harp lake had poor fits for do nse 0 in these lakes the model captured annual and seasonal doc and do dynamics but did not consistently characterize the magnitude of short term spikes in doc i e days to weeks fig 2 nonetheless long term model performance indicated the ability to account for lake variability in doc and do at seasonal to inter annual time scales across all lakes parameter estimates for the allochthonous components of the budget were generally more consistent and better constrained than those for autochthonous inputs table 4 respiration of allochthonous doc rdocalloch ranged from about 0 0011 0 0025 d 1 among lakes and sem values were about two orders of magnitude lower indicating tightly constrained mean values in contrast respiration of autochthonous doc rdocautoch was higher and more variable than rdocalloch among lakes ranging from about 0 0034 0 4500 d 1 burial rates for allochthonous inputs bpocalloch were high with values at or near the upper limit 1 0000 d 1 for all lakes except lake monona burial of autochthonous inputs bpocautoch was comparatively lower and more variable ranging from approximately 0 0310 0 8700 d 1 sem values for burial tended to be about one order of magnitude smaller than corresponding parameter means across all lakes modeled doc mg l 1 was generally most sensitive to rdocalloch except for lake monona for which modeled doc was most sensitive to bpocautoch fig 3 the other four lakes were minimally affected by changes in bpocautoch 1 mg l 1 difference across the range of parameter values changes in bpocalloch had consistently small effects 2 mg l 1 on modeled doc across all lakes trout lake harp lake and lake vänern were the most sensitive to rdocalloch with modeled doc ranging about 2 3 mg l 1 across the range of parameter values whereas toolik lake and lake monona were moderately sensitive 1 1 5 mg l 1 differences and lake vänern overall parameter sensitivity was greatest for harp lake lake monona and trout lake for which modeled doc varied as much as 5 6 mg l 1 across the range of parameter values fig 3 conversely modeled doc varied no more than 2 and 3 mg l 1 for toolik lake and lake vänern respectively 3 2 summary of fluxes and fates with the exception of trout lake oc loads were primarily driven by allochthonous inputs underscoring the importance of terrestrially derived oc in overall lake budgets table 5 fig 4 additionally respiration exceeded burial in all lakes but lake monona trout lake also had the smallest total annual oc load of the five lakes 43 69 g m 2 yr 1 the lowest proportion of total load exported 0 09 and the largest proportional difference between respiration 0 76 and burial 0 17 among all lakes lake monona had the largest total oc load 118 88 g m 2 yr 1 among lakes lowest proportion respired 0 14 and second greatest proportion buried 0 36 lake monona was the only lake dominated by burial long term on average burial rates were greater than twice respiration rates across modeled years in contrast proportions of burial 0 36 and respiration 0 37 in harp lake were approximately equal harp lake also exhibited proportions of allochthonous 0 55 and autochthonous inputs 0 45 that were approximately similar in lake monona and lake vänern toolik lake had the second largest mean 87 33 g m 2 yr 1 but most variable standard deviation sd 63 07 g m 2 yr 1 total oc load and was the most driven by allochthonous inputs 0 87 among all lakes this inter annual variability in total oc load for toolik lake was driven by highly variable allochthonous inputs sd 64 95 g m 2 yr 1 and also resulted in highly variable export sd 54 85 g m 2 yr 1 compared to other lakes toolik lake on average demonstrated the lowest proportion buried 0 07 and greatest proportion exported 0 64 3 3 seasonal fates seasonal patterns in oc fluxes were consistent across entire respective time series for each lake with autochthonous inputs and respiration increasing to a summer maximum fig 4 as water temperatures increased during the growing season e g may aug the balance between allochthonous and autochthonous inputs generally shifted toward autochthonous inputs due to increases in npp whereas the ratio between respiration and burial generally shifted towards respiration figs 4 and 5 there was high seasonal variability in the dominant fluxes in each lake fig 5 trout lake remained dominated by respiration year round but respiration increased relative to burial as water temperatures warmed harp lake and lake vänern were dominated by burial early in the growing season but became dominated by respiration as temperatures warmed whereas respiration in lake monona exceeded burial late in the growing season the lake remained dominated by burial when calculated on an annual basis table 5 fig 5 toolik lake was dominated by respiration most of the year and respiration increased as the ratio of autochthonous to allochthonous inputs increased this distinct negative slope as the growing season progressed was unique to toolik lake suggesting the importance of continued allochthonous inputs during summer months in the other lakes in addition to autochthonous inputs overall these seasonal dynamics suggest that water temperatures are associated with changes in the balance between key oc fates burial and respiration but that such shifts are mediated by the balance between allochthonous and autochthonous inputs that vary across lake systems 4 discussion 4 1 representing lake processes although our model is not exhaustive in accounting for all oc pathways and relies on empirically derived equations our results indicated that a relatively simple dynamic model can recreate long term trends in doc and represent the set of key biogeochemical trophic and landscape processes that combine to determine the fate of oc in lake ecosystems further the fluxes we modeled were within the range of other published studies for these lakes based on steady state models using much of the same lter data hanson et al 2014 provided similar estimates for trout of allochthonous inputs hanson 15 92 g m 2 yr 1 our model 15 65 g m 2 yr 1 burial hanson 3 66 g m 2 yr 1 our model 7 46 g m 2 yr 1 and export hanson 4 95 g m 2 yr 1 our model 3 96 g m 2 yr 1 but not for respiration hanson 7 31 g m 2 yr 1 our model 33 04 g m 2 yr 1 likely because hanson et al 2014 did not account for autochthonous inputs similar to our study whalen and cornwell 1985 demonstrated that toolik lake was driven by high proportional allochthonous inputs whalen and cornwall 0 91 our study 0 87 relative to autochthonous inputs and low burial whalen and cornwall 0 02 our study 0 07 our proportion exported 0 64 contrasted somewhat with whalen and cornwall 0 82 but much of this excess export was respired 0 28 in our model dillon and molot s 1997 proportional estimates for burial in harp lake were low compared to ours dillon and molot 0 01 our model 26 60 and the magnitudes of allochthonous inputs were somewhat similar dillon and molot 28 9 g m 2 yr 1 our study 40 05 g m 2 yr 1 but dillon and molot 1997 did not consider autochthonous inputs therefore we are unable to compare total loads and differences in the proportion exported in dillon and molot 0 58 vs our study 0 25 which may be explained by our inclusion of autochthonous inputs and respiration differences in budget estimates may also be due to differences in study years dillon and molot 1981 1989 our study 1991 2001 although our results generally agreed with prior studies based on steady state models our estimated respiration rates were generally higher than those noted in the literature hanson et al 2014 dillon and molot 1997 we offer that dynamic models better represent these processes by accounting for seasonal changes in temperature and chl a concentrations therefore although steady state models may be sufficient for recreating some key ecological processes dynamic models are needed for determining the relative magnitudes of oc fates in lake ecosystems given the importance of autochthonous inputs and respiration 4 2 key uncertainties in oc fates well constrained estimates of oc burial in lakes remain a challenge to model although our estimates for burial parameters have relatively low uncertainties table 4 burial may be underestimated for these lakes the sensitivity analysis revealed that modeled doc generally varied 2 mg l 1 as a function of bpocalloch which accounted for up to 50 of modeled doc except for lake monona which was highly sensitive to bpocalloch a key consideration is that our model buried close to 100 of pocalloch in all lakes except lake monona table 4 bpocalloch therefore any increase in pocalloch would be directly proportional to increases in burial owing to lack of observational data we assumed pocalloch was 10 of docalloch cpocfactor but this may be an underestimate and does not account for potential seasonal variation in the doc poc ratio intense precipitation can increase poc concentration disproportionately to doc concentration in streams jeong et al 2012 dhillon and inamdar 2013 which could temporarily increase pocalloch and thus burial wet years increase docalloch inputs to lakes at regional scales by increasing connectivity among waterbodies rose et al 2017 and mobilizing doc from soils tank et al 2018 and probably also increase pocalloch however short term spikes in poc are unlikely to have large effects on long term oc budgets and ratios between poc and doc although our burial estimates were somewhat uncertain due to underrepresentation of pocalloch during precipitation events burial would have to increase substantially over the course of the entire modeling period for burial to dominate over respiration including three fold or greater for toolik lake and trout lake table 5 therefore missing pocalloch likely leads to underestimates of burial but is unlikely to account for enough oc to affect long term budgets and exceed the magnitudes of respiration in many lake ecosystems given the insensitivity of modeled doc to bpocalloch across our five study lakes 4 3 on going research and data needs our work is an important advance in quantifying the fates of oc across aquatic ecosystems however we encountered constraints associated with current data availability if requisite data were collected for a larger number of lakes spanning wider environmental gradients e g climate watershed conditions trophic state water residence times contributions of lakes to landscape carbon cycles could be better estimated at broad spatial scales hotchkiss et al 2018 jones et al 2018 seekell et al 2018 although we designed our modeling framework to be flexible across different lake ecosystems our study contained four north temperate lakes and one arctic lake all of which were deep and dimictic summer and winter stratification and spring and autumn mixing of the water column literature based parameters were obtained from previous research on these lake ecosystems and may not apply in all other lake ecosystems future work should include additional high latitude tropical or shallow lakes to test the generalizability of our model across a more diverse set of lake ecosystems than those included in this study nonetheless part of our intention for including model data and code with this manuscript was so that future work can build off our model and make adjustments as more data across more diverse lake ecosystems become available during model development we encountered a notable paucity of high frequency measurements of inflow doc concentration of which broader collection would facilitate dynamic oc modeling in more lakes although collection of these data may be expensive and logistically challenging the increasing availability of automated high frequency sensor equipment may alleviate long term costs associated with sensor deployment and manual data retrieval in addition relatively little is currently known about poc budgets despite their key interactions with doc einsele et al 2001 we need more poc observational data for incorporation into dynamic models of oc particularly in inflows for estimating pocalloch such studies would help constrain poc parameters and improve estimates of the fates of poc within overall oc budgets finally data limitations required us to make simplifying assumptions about the volume of groundwater inputs and the lakes themselves although these are common assumptions in similar mass balance studies the inability to account for groundwater may lead to underestimates of allochthonous inputs and may complicate comparisons across lakes particularly isolated lakes the one lake with non zero estimated groundwater volume however was trout lake for which modeled allochthonous inputs were lowest across lakes in this study nonetheless a key implication of our study is the need for more observational data particularly pertaining to surface water and groundwater volume and doc concentrations poc cycling and burial rates additionally data limitations may explain poor nse scores 0 for doc for harp lake and trout lake which indicate that modeled doc was no more accurate than long term doc means table 4 for harp lake modeled doc was generally lower than observed doc fig 3 potentially due to artificially low do measurements which reduced nse for do for harp lake underestimated do would lead to underestimated respiration which would reduce autochthonous inputs for trout lake the model did not capture short term spring time dips in doc fig 3 which may potentially be explained by ice melt dynamics not represented in interpolated inflow doc data in addition nse was also poor for do for toolik lake modeled do was consistently higher than observations fig 3 this suggests overestimated autochthonous inputs and therefore underestimated allochthonous inputs which may be attributed to undetected pulses in inflow doc in surface water or groundwater additionally food web dynamics e g grazing may also help explain large fluctuations in allochthonous inputs or poor nse values in general whereas short term spikes are unlikely to affect long term oc fate estimates consistent biases in observations may skew model outputs therefore dynamic models such as ours can be used to identify important sources of uncertainty in overall oc budgets that can be targeted in future monitoring and research 4 4 lessons from a dynamic model implications in a dynamic world prior to our study it was known that lakes actively process emit and store globally significant amounts of c cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 raymond et al 2013 our results demonstrate that a dynamic model can considerably advance knowledge on the role of lakes in landscape and ultimately global c cycling by highlighting dominant inputs and fates of oc in individual systems lakes more readily respire more autochthonous than allochthonous oc wetzel 2001 in our study our one lake dominated by autochthonous inputs trout lake exhibited the greatest respiration relative to burial table 5 therefore lakes as global c sources or sinks may depend both on the balances between 1 respiration and burial and 2 allochthonous and autochthonous inputs the balance between respiration and burial can vary according to regional climate and respiration is typically greater than burial in boreal lakes compared to those in higher latitudes anthony et al 2014 this represents a potential negative feedback for the global c cycle under a warming climate with poleward boreal advance and thawing of frozen high latitude lakes anthony et al 2014 our model identified another important global change implication associated with warming water temperatures across all lakes in our study warm surface temperatures were generally associated with a shift toward autochthonous relative to allochthonous inputs as well as an increase in respiration relative to burial fig 5 this likely is due to elevated npp during summer growing seasons accompanied by relatively high respiration rates of autochthonous relative to allochthonous inputs table 4 although the balance between respiration and burial appears to shift toward respiration with increases in temperature it is also possible for burial to increase with temperature if temperature increases coincide with greater oc loads e g warm season precipitation events increasing pocalloch and consequently burial as a function of bpocalloch as such our results suggest that processes favoring allochthonous inputs will generally have a greater effect on oc burial than processes that drive autochthonous inputs more broadly however lakes have generally become more productive under recent climate warming kraemer et al 2016 which our study suggests favors autochthonous over allochthonous inputs and respiration over burial therefore changes in both precipitation including magnitude timing duration and form de wit et al 2018 and air temperature have key implications for the fate of oc in lake ecosystems under a changing climate reed et al 2018 however effects of warming will vary according to the balance between allochthonous and autochthonous inputs which is mediated by precipitation due to its effect on the origin of the total oc load although our model was not designed as a predictive tool our findings illustrate the usefulness of a dynamic mass balance model for highlighting key global change processes and interactions that ultimately influence the role of lakes in global c cycling improved estimates of the contribution of lakes to global c budgets should account for the source and degradability of total oc loads and consequent effects on respiration and burial acknowledgments this project was a product of the global lake ecological observatory network

25204,lakes are active processors of organic carbon oc and play important roles in landscape and global carbon cycling allochthonous oc loads from the landscape along with autochthonous oc loads from primary production are mineralized in lakes buried in lake sediments and exported via surface or groundwater outflows although these processes provide a basis for a conceptual understanding of lake oc budgets few studies have integrated these fluxes under a dynamic modeling framework to examine their interactions and relative magnitudes we developed a simple dynamic mass balance model for oc and applied the model to a set of five lakes we examined the relative magnitudes of oc fluxes and found that long term 10 year lake oc dynamics were predominantly driven by allochthonous loads in four of the five lakes underscoring the importance of terrestrially derived oc in northern lake ecosystems our model highlighted seasonal patterns in lake oc budgets with increasing water temperatures and lake productivity throughout the growing season corresponding to a transition from burial to respiration dominated oc fates ratios of respiration to burial however were also mediated by the source autochthonous vs allochthonous of total oc loads autochthonous oc is more readily respired and may therefore proportionally reduce burial under a warming climate but allochthonous oc may increase burial due to changes in precipitation the ratios of autochthonous to allochthonous inputs and respiration to burial demonstrate the importance of dynamic models for examining both the seasonal and inter annual roles of lakes in landscape and global carbon cycling particularly in a global change context finally we highlighted critical data needs which include surface water doc observations in paired tributary and lake systems measurements of oc burial rates groundwater input volume and doc and budgets of particulate oc keywords carbon cycle mass balance dissolved organic carbon particulate

ecosystem scale studies that fully balance oc budgets cole et al 1989 hanson et al 2014 2015 there remains a considerable knowledge gap in lake oc dynamics and thus in fully understanding the role of lakes in the global c cycle global estimates of co2 emissions i e evasion from lakes and reservoirs are 0 32 pg petagrams c yr 1 raymond et al 2013 whereas anywhere from 0 02 0 07 pg c yr 1 tranvik et al 2009 to 0 06 0 25 pg c yr 1 are stored in sediments mendonça et al 2017 these estimates however are highly uncertain and models that dynamically account for major oc fluxes and storage terms in lakes and that explore uncertainties around those terms are needed to advance our understanding of lake oc cycling and their contribution to global c budgets hanson et al 2015 reed et al 2018 existing mass balance models are generally based on low spatio temporal frequency data confined to single lakes and are often from boreal regions jonsson et al 2001 urban et al 2005 andersson and sobek 2006 cremona et al 2014 in a first step in overcoming some of these limitations we developed and applied a dynamic mass balance model to examine the relative magnitudes of oc fluxes across a set of five lakes with whole ecosystem oc budget data our goal was to build a simple oc model that could be applied in a range of lake ecosystems to capture seasonal and annual variation in oc concentrations 1 1 overview of concepts of key oc fluxes in lake ecosystems for lakes the term mass balance has been broadly used to quantify carbon or nutrient budgets as the combination of inputs outputs and changes to standing stocks in the water column and sediments pace and lovett 2013 inputs to lake ecosystem oc budgets are the sum of allochthonous externally derived dissolved doc and particulate oc poc inflows from surface and groundwater sources atmospheric deposition via precipitation dry deposits and litterfall and autochthonous internally derived doc and poc kawasaki and benner 2006 and phytoplanktonic primary production outputs from the oc pool reflect mechanisms that mineralize i e photo oxidation and respiration and export oc via surface and groundwater outflows here for simplicity all mineralization processes that convert oc to co2 are collectively modeled as respiration the mass change in oc in the water column and lake sediments is considered as change in storage outputs and storage are the fates of oc loads and their balances define the role of lakes in broader c cycling box 1 fig 1 at the global scale lakes are thought to be net sources of c to the atmosphere based on the mean co2 kortelainen et al 2006 tranvik et al 2009 raymond et al 2013 and methane bastviken et al 2011 concentrations at higher than atmospheric levels in lake surface waters oc export is less frequently considered but equally important in terms of the quality and quantity of oc ultimately reaching the ocean via tributaries raymond and bauer 2001 santoso et al 2017 because lakes store oc in sediments they can also act as sinks in the global c cycle mulholland and elwood 1982 dillon and molot 1997 einsele et al 2001 einola et al 2011 we synthesized existing knowledge of lake oc budgets into a model that integrates these important mechanisms including both in lake as well as external i e watershed processes fig 1 below we described these processes in three main categories of the dominant processes that influence long term lake oc budgets 1 allochthonous inputs 2 autochthonous inputs and 3 storage and export 1 2 allochthonous inputs allochthonous inputs include all externally derived oc including terrestrial doc and poc from surface and groundwater inflows litterfall and direct fall precipitation box 1 although surface water inflows regularly deliver doc to lake ecosystems the uncertainties around their sources and magnitudes are perhaps the most commonly overlooked aspect in oc budgets largely owing to data limitations hanson et al 2015 duffy et al 2018 prior studies have included direct measurements of inflow stream concentrations of doc when available schindler et al 1997 jonsson et al 2001 urban et al 2005 klump et al 2009 but other approaches have included literature derived input estimates striegl and michmerhuizen 1998 equations based on watershed area sobek et al 2006 watershed wetland area ratios o connor et al 2009 precipitation hanson et al 2004 staehr et al 2010 or gis based estimates based on land cover and distance weighted hydrological flow paths canham et al 2004 in lakes without surface inflows including closed basin and seepage lakes groundwater can be the dominant hydrological input e g gaiser et al 2009 and can deliver doc to lakes especially in organic rich soils schindler and krabbenhoft 1998 empirical measurements of groundwater discharge and doc concentration however are rare and difficult to estimate hanson et al 2014 poc inputs from litterfall and wet and dry atmospheric deposition are typically small and are generally estimated as a function of lake size and literature or expert based loading coefficients hanson et al 2004 1 3 autochthonous inputs autochthonous doc and poc originate within lakes through bacterial exudates and photosynthesis by primary producers since gross primary production gpp is difficult to measure at the ecosystem level net primary production npp considered the difference between gpp and autotrophic respiration is measured instead pace and lovett 2013 box 1 approaches to estimate npp include bottle incubations urban 2005 yang et al 2008 and high frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen or co2 concentrations cole et al 2002 staehr et al 2010 statistical relationships have also been developed to estimate npp from lake temperature and total phosphorus tp hanson et al 2004 chlorophyll a chl a jonsson et al 2001 ramlal et al 2003 or static proportions of the overall oc pool åberg et al 2004 1 4 storage and export long term burial of poc in lake sediments is the mechanism by which lakes remove c from the global c cycle and is therefore a critical component of our understanding of the fate of both allochthonous and autochthonous poc cole et al 2002 tranvik et al 2009 mendonça et al 2017 poc burial in lakes is a product of in lake poc concentrations poc particle sizes and associated settling rates sediment particle size and density that control resuspension lake hydrodynamics that affect settling rates and resuspension and benthic biogeochemistry downing et al 2008 xu et al 2013 methods for estimating sediment accumulation rates are diverse and commonly include functions based on lake area canham et al 2004 hanson et al 2004 sediment cores yang et al 2008 klump et al 2009 heathcote and downing 2012 sediment traps jonsson et al 2001 ramlal et al 2003 or bathymetry downing et al 2008 a challenge associated with estimating accumulation rates is the reliance on point measurements to characterize sediment accumulation rates that can vary widely over both space and time allochthonous and autochthonous poc that is not buried is exported directly mineralized or leached in the form of doc and exported via surface or groundwater cole et al 1984 exports represent allochthonous inputs to downstream aquatic ecosystems and therefore contribute to landscape c cycling kling et al 2000 1 5 objective and research question our broad objectives were 1 to quantify long term i e 10 year dynamics and magnitudes of doc fluxes through the development of a simple dynamic model and 2 to use this model to reveal the dynamics of dominant drivers of oc fates allochthonous vs autochtonous load and burial vs respiration we applied the model to five lakes that encompass contrasts in morphology hydrology and trophic state to understand the relative influence of these lake characteristics on oc cycling and to address our overarching research question what are the magnitudes and uncertainties in processes governing lake oc cycling and how do these change through time 2 methods 2 1 study lakes and data sources we modeled temporal dynamics of oc budgets for five lakes that span a range of limnological characteristics e g hydrologic residence time depth trophic state table 1 lakes were selected based on contrasting characteristics and availability of observational data required observational data included precipitation hydrological inflow discharge inflow doc concentration and various in lake measurements surface water temperature chl a concentration and secchi depth all lakes had a minimum of 10 years of limnological data used for model training and at least four years of in lake doc and do measurements for model validation see the appendix for detailed data descriptions and sources supplementary material our dataset included four oligotrophic lakes and one eutrophic lake lake areas ranged from 71 38 ha to 565 000 ha and mean depths ranged from 7 m to 27 m hydrologic residence times ranged from 0 8 years to 6 3 years in lake mean annual doc concentrations ranged from 3 g m 3 to 6 g m 3 watersheds are primarily forested for harp lake trout lake and lake vänern whereas toolik lake is in a tundra dominated watershed and monona is in an agricultural and heavily developed watershed 2 2 general model approach we developed a relatively simple dynamic mass balance model fig 1 tables 2 and 3 that included four state variables representing oc table 3 eqs 1 4 and one representing dissolved oxygen do eq 5 literature based and calibrated parameters for the equations are in table 2 we used literature based parameters for processes generally described in previous studies and when lake specific information was unavailable and to prevent overfitting of the model allochthonous doc and poc eqs 1 2 for the lakes were modeled separately from autochthonous doc and poc eqs 3 4 model complexity was commensurate with the number of observational variables available we operated the model on a daily time step for 10 13 years based on data availability as all five lakes are drainage lakes with outlet streams lake levels are relatively stable from 1995 to 2017 trout lake varied 0 5 m and lake monona varied 1 m n lottig personal communication lake vänern varied 1 m from 2003 to 2009 tongal and berndtsson 2014 lake level and therefore volume was assumed static over the modeling period inflow discharge at a daily time step was available for all study lakes doc concentration of inflows was available at weekly or biweekly intervals to model inflow doc at a daily time step we used the loadflex package in r to fit stream load models for each system appling et al 2015 we first fit a regression model for each lake which was then incorporated in a composite method which uses model residuals from the regression model to adjust predictions based on observed data aulenbach 2013 kelly et al 2018 after testing the nine available regression models model 9 was used for all lakes except trout lake where model 4 returned the best fit see kelly et al 2018 for full regression model equations when inflow doc concentrations were not available for all tributaries doc was scaled to equal total inflow volume observational data of in lake chl a secchi depth and temperature were available weekly or bi weekly and were linearly interpolated to a daily time step precipitation was assumed zero for missing dates however precipitation data gaps were rare to account for the absence of winter data at toolik we set inflow doc to 0 when the main inflow toolik inlet was frozen supplementary material the model was written and executed in r version 3 3 2 r core team 2016 model code and data are available here https github com gleon sos 2 3 allochthonous doc and poc changes in allochthonous doc were modeled as a function of doc load deposition leaching mineralization and export docalloch eq 1 allochthonous doc load was calculated as the sum of inflows idoc eq 1 1 from both surface idoc sw eq 1 11 and groundwater idoc gw eq 1 12 and deposition ddoc eq 1 2 from precipitation dprecip eq 1 21 and adjacent wetlands dwetland eq 1 22 mass loads were calculated as the product of doc concentrations and flows except for dwetland which was the product of the proportion of lake perimeter that is wetland pwetland a parameter representing a transfer coefficient cdocwetland of doc from the wetland to the lake and lake perimeter lakeperimeter the third input lalloch eq 1 3 represented in lake leaching of pocalloch to docalloch as the product of a first order decay rate clalloch 1 bpocalloch and the pocalloch concentration there were two fates of docalloch eq 1 the first was mineralization mdocalloch eq 1 4 which was the product of a first order decay rate rdocalloch the docalloch concentration and a q10 temperature adjustment using a standard arrhenius equation a temperature multiplier θ of 1 08 was used for all lakes equating to a q10 2 reynolds and irish 1997 the second was export downstream edocalloch eq 1 5 which was the product of docalloch and outflow qoutflow changes in allochthonous poc were modeled as a function of poc load deposition leaching burial and export pocalloch eq 2 allochthonous poc input ipoc eq 2 1 was modeled as a proportion of idoc cpocfactor deposition dpoc eq 2 2 was the sum of canopy dpoccanopy and wetland dpocwetland inputs where dpoccanopy eq 2 21 was the product of the proportion of lake perimeter that is canopy pcanopy a parameter representing a transfer coefficient cpocaerial of poc from the canopy to the lake and lakeperimeter dpocwetland eq 2 22 was assumed to scale with ddocwetland by the proportion cpocfactor pocalloch had a burial fate balloch eq 2 3 calculated as the product of a burial coefficient bpocalloch and pocalloch as with docalloch downstream export epocalloch eq 2 4 was included as the product of pocalloch and outflow daily precipitation qprecip mm was based on measurements from the weather station nearest to each lake the concentration of doc in precipitation was set to 2 g m 3 hanson et al 2014 time series of lake specific groundwater inflow volume m3 and doc concentration g m 3 were not available we estimated the proportion of inflow as groundwater in our study lakes based on literature values when available but assumed no groundwater in the absence of data supplementary material resulting estimated groundwater proportions were 0 for all lakes except trout lake which we estimated at 19 hanson et al 2014 groundwater doc concentration was assumed to be 10 g m 3 table 2 docgwconc hanson et al 2014 shoreline adjacent wetlands and forests were estimated from publicly available spatial datasets supplementary material we focused on wetlands adjacent to the shoreline because they contribute most of wetland derived doc to lakes not already captured in eq 1 1 hanson et al 2014 to account for potential misalignment among spatial wetland and forest data and lake boundaries we defined adjacency as within 30 m of lake boundaries 2 4 autochthonous doc and poc our approach to modeling autochthonous inputs table 3 eqs 3 4 was generally similar to that of allochthonous inputs for leaching mineralization export and burial eqs 3 3 3 5 4 2 4 3 but differed in the input terms nppdoc eq 3 2 and npppoc eq 4 1 total autochthonous inputs npptot eq 3 1 were the product of gpp which was modeled as a function of chl a μg l 1 mixing depth zmix set to half of photic depth m and surface water temperature t c per morin et al 1999 and the proportion of gpp not respired by autotrophs 1 rautotroph the gpp function was calculated using observed temperature and chl a data that ranged from 5 to 25 c and 1 1000 mg m 2 respectively across all lakes since models of gpp are not well constrained at low temperatures we set gpp to zero if surface water temperatures were 4 c chl a concentrations were converted from volumetric to areal units by multiplying by photic depth which was estimated from secchi depth m wetzel 2001 the doc fraction of total npp nppdoc was calculated using the pace and prairie 2005 negative exponential equation eq 3 2 the remainder of npptot was attributed to poc npppoc eq 4 1 water column dissolved oxygen do was used to constrain net ecosystem production nepoc eq 5 1 under the assumption that at short time scales and under pseudo equilibrium conditions atmospheric exchange fatm approximated nepoc fatm eq 5 2 was calculated as a function of piston velocity k set to 0 7 m d 1 with no wind speed data this is a conservative estimate do and do saturation and mixing depth zmix the saturation of do dosat is temperature dependent and was determined using the garcia benson method in the lakemetabolizer r package winslow et al 2016 heterotrophic respiration rhtot was calculated as a function of docautoch and docalloch concentration g m 3 in the photic zone epilimnion temperature assumed to be uniform through the photic zone and two calibrated parameters rdocautoch and rdocalloch tables 2 and 3 eqs 1 4 3 4 5 12 see model calibration and uncertainty analysis we determined epilimnion temperature by averaging observed temperatures throughout the photic zone when data were available from multiple depths but otherwise used surface temperature supplementary material 2 5 model calibration and uncertainty analysis the collinearity of the four free parameters in the model respiration rdocalloch rdocautoch burial bpocalloch and bpocautoch table 2 was tested using the collin function in the r package fme soetaert and petzoldt 2010 in general when the collinearity index is less than 20 linear independence is assumed brun et al 2001 omlin et al 2001 finding low collinearity the four parameters were fit by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals of doc and do do residuals were weighted 0 25 that of doc and the total number of residuals was equally weighted between do and doc the model was fit using a pseudo random search algorithm in the fme package burial parameters were constrained in the model as a proportion between 0 no burial of poc and 1 all poc is buried rdocalloch was constrained between 0 0003 and 0 03 d 1 based on the range of oc decomposition rates for inland waters with residence times between 1 10 years presented in catalán et al 2016 rdocautoch was constrained between 0 003 and 0 3 d 1 hanson et al 2004 goodness of fit was evaluated with root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse scores calculated for doc and do for each lake using the hydrogof r package zambrano bigiarini 2017 goodness of fits were reported for doc and do because the model was fit to both simultaneously rather than individually a sensitivity analysis of each parameter was conducted by allowing the parameter to vary at 100 different values within the set bounds while fixing the other three parameters at their calibrated values we estimated parameter means and uncertainties using a bootstrapping routine per dugan et al 2017 using the bootstrapped parameters we calculated residual errors between observed and modeled doc and do we created 100 pseudo observational datasets by randomizing these residuals 100 times and adding each randomized residual set to the observed data we then re fit the parameters to the pseudo observational datasets to provide 100 new parameter estimates finally we recorded parameter distribution characteristics and assessed correlations among parameters within each lake 3 results 3 1 model performance parameter estimates and sensitivity analysis modeled doc and do generally followed observed temporal patterns across years in each study lake fig 2 the rmse of the model fits for doc and do were below 0 6 mg l 1 and 1 7 mg l 1 respectively table 4 the nse metric reveals if the modeled results are more accurate nse 0 than the long term mean nse reveals strong model fits for lake monona and vänern for both doc and do table 4 trout lake and harp lake had poor fits for doc nse 0 and toolik and harp lake had poor fits for do nse 0 in these lakes the model captured annual and seasonal doc and do dynamics but did not consistently characterize the magnitude of short term spikes in doc i e days to weeks fig 2 nonetheless long term model performance indicated the ability to account for lake variability in doc and do at seasonal to inter annual time scales across all lakes parameter estimates for the allochthonous components of the budget were generally more consistent and better constrained than those for autochthonous inputs table 4 respiration of allochthonous doc rdocalloch ranged from about 0 0011 0 0025 d 1 among lakes and sem values were about two orders of magnitude lower indicating tightly constrained mean values in contrast respiration of autochthonous doc rdocautoch was higher and more variable than rdocalloch among lakes ranging from about 0 0034 0 4500 d 1 burial rates for allochthonous inputs bpocalloch were high with values at or near the upper limit 1 0000 d 1 for all lakes except lake monona burial of autochthonous inputs bpocautoch was comparatively lower and more variable ranging from approximately 0 0310 0 8700 d 1 sem values for burial tended to be about one order of magnitude smaller than corresponding parameter means across all lakes modeled doc mg l 1 was generally most sensitive to rdocalloch except for lake monona for which modeled doc was most sensitive to bpocautoch fig 3 the other four lakes were minimally affected by changes in bpocautoch 1 mg l 1 difference across the range of parameter values changes in bpocalloch had consistently small effects 2 mg l 1 on modeled doc across all lakes trout lake harp lake and lake vänern were the most sensitive to rdocalloch with modeled doc ranging about 2 3 mg l 1 across the range of parameter values whereas toolik lake and lake monona were moderately sensitive 1 1 5 mg l 1 differences and lake vänern overall parameter sensitivity was greatest for harp lake lake monona and trout lake for which modeled doc varied as much as 5 6 mg l 1 across the range of parameter values fig 3 conversely modeled doc varied no more than 2 and 3 mg l 1 for toolik lake and lake vänern respectively 3 2 summary of fluxes and fates with the exception of trout lake oc loads were primarily driven by allochthonous inputs underscoring the importance of terrestrially derived oc in overall lake budgets table 5 fig 4 additionally respiration exceeded burial in all lakes but lake monona trout lake also had the smallest total annual oc load of the five lakes 43 69 g m 2 yr 1 the lowest proportion of total load exported 0 09 and the largest proportional difference between respiration 0 76 and burial 0 17 among all lakes lake monona had the largest total oc load 118 88 g m 2 yr 1 among lakes lowest proportion respired 0 14 and second greatest proportion buried 0 36 lake monona was the only lake dominated by burial long term on average burial rates were greater than twice respiration rates across modeled years in contrast proportions of burial 0 36 and respiration 0 37 in harp lake were approximately equal harp lake also exhibited proportions of allochthonous 0 55 and autochthonous inputs 0 45 that were approximately similar in lake monona and lake vänern toolik lake had the second largest mean 87 33 g m 2 yr 1 but most variable standard deviation sd 63 07 g m 2 yr 1 total oc load and was the most driven by allochthonous inputs 0 87 among all lakes this inter annual variability in total oc load for toolik lake was driven by highly variable allochthonous inputs sd 64 95 g m 2 yr 1 and also resulted in highly variable export sd 54 85 g m 2 yr 1 compared to other lakes toolik lake on average demonstrated the lowest proportion buried 0 07 and greatest proportion exported 0 64 3 3 seasonal fates seasonal patterns in oc fluxes were consistent across entire respective time series for each lake with autochthonous inputs and respiration increasing to a summer maximum fig 4 as water temperatures increased during the growing season e g may aug the balance between allochthonous and autochthonous inputs generally shifted toward autochthonous inputs due to increases in npp whereas the ratio between respiration and burial generally shifted towards respiration figs 4 and 5 there was high seasonal variability in the dominant fluxes in each lake fig 5 trout lake remained dominated by respiration year round but respiration increased relative to burial as water temperatures warmed harp lake and lake vänern were dominated by burial early in the growing season but became dominated by respiration as temperatures warmed whereas respiration in lake monona exceeded burial late in the growing season the lake remained dominated by burial when calculated on an annual basis table 5 fig 5 toolik lake was dominated by respiration most of the year and respiration increased as the ratio of autochthonous to allochthonous inputs increased this distinct negative slope as the growing season progressed was unique to toolik lake suggesting the importance of continued allochthonous inputs during summer months in the other lakes in addition to autochthonous inputs overall these seasonal dynamics suggest that water temperatures are associated with changes in the balance between key oc fates burial and respiration but that such shifts are mediated by the balance between allochthonous and autochthonous inputs that vary across lake systems 4 discussion 4 1 representing lake processes although our model is not exhaustive in accounting for all oc pathways and relies on empirically derived equations our results indicated that a relatively simple dynamic model can recreate long term trends in doc and represent the set of key biogeochemical trophic and landscape processes that combine to determine the fate of oc in lake ecosystems further the fluxes we modeled were within the range of other published studies for these lakes based on steady state models using much of the same lter data hanson et al 2014 provided similar estimates for trout of allochthonous inputs hanson 15 92 g m 2 yr 1 our model 15 65 g m 2 yr 1 burial hanson 3 66 g m 2 yr 1 our model 7 46 g m 2 yr 1 and export hanson 4 95 g m 2 yr 1 our model 3 96 g m 2 yr 1 but not for respiration hanson 7 31 g m 2 yr 1 our model 33 04 g m 2 yr 1 likely because hanson et al 2014 did not account for autochthonous inputs similar to our study whalen and cornwell 1985 demonstrated that toolik lake was driven by high proportional allochthonous inputs whalen and cornwall 0 91 our study 0 87 relative to autochthonous inputs and low burial whalen and cornwall 0 02 our study 0 07 our proportion exported 0 64 contrasted somewhat with whalen and cornwall 0 82 but much of this excess export was respired 0 28 in our model dillon and molot s 1997 proportional estimates for burial in harp lake were low compared to ours dillon and molot 0 01 our model 26 60 and the magnitudes of allochthonous inputs were somewhat similar dillon and molot 28 9 g m 2 yr 1 our study 40 05 g m 2 yr 1 but dillon and molot 1997 did not consider autochthonous inputs therefore we are unable to compare total loads and differences in the proportion exported in dillon and molot 0 58 vs our study 0 25 which may be explained by our inclusion of autochthonous inputs and respiration differences in budget estimates may also be due to differences in study years dillon and molot 1981 1989 our study 1991 2001 although our results generally agreed with prior studies based on steady state models our estimated respiration rates were generally higher than those noted in the literature hanson et al 2014 dillon and molot 1997 we offer that dynamic models better represent these processes by accounting for seasonal changes in temperature and chl a concentrations therefore although steady state models may be sufficient for recreating some key ecological processes dynamic models are needed for determining the relative magnitudes of oc fates in lake ecosystems given the importance of autochthonous inputs and respiration 4 2 key uncertainties in oc fates well constrained estimates of oc burial in lakes remain a challenge to model although our estimates for burial parameters have relatively low uncertainties table 4 burial may be underestimated for these lakes the sensitivity analysis revealed that modeled doc generally varied 2 mg l 1 as a function of bpocalloch which accounted for up to 50 of modeled doc except for lake monona which was highly sensitive to bpocalloch a key consideration is that our model buried close to 100 of pocalloch in all lakes except lake monona table 4 bpocalloch therefore any increase in pocalloch would be directly proportional to increases in burial owing to lack of observational data we assumed pocalloch was 10 of docalloch cpocfactor but this may be an underestimate and does not account for potential seasonal variation in the doc poc ratio intense precipitation can increase poc concentration disproportionately to doc concentration in streams jeong et al 2012 dhillon and inamdar 2013 which could temporarily increase pocalloch and thus burial wet years increase docalloch inputs to lakes at regional scales by increasing connectivity among waterbodies rose et al 2017 and mobilizing doc from soils tank et al 2018 and probably also increase pocalloch however short term spikes in poc are unlikely to have large effects on long term oc budgets and ratios between poc and doc although our burial estimates were somewhat uncertain due to underrepresentation of pocalloch during precipitation events burial would have to increase substantially over the course of the entire modeling period for burial to dominate over respiration including three fold or greater for toolik lake and trout lake table 5 therefore missing pocalloch likely leads to underestimates of burial but is unlikely to account for enough oc to affect long term budgets and exceed the magnitudes of respiration in many lake ecosystems given the insensitivity of modeled doc to bpocalloch across our five study lakes 4 3 on going research and data needs our work is an important advance in quantifying the fates of oc across aquatic ecosystems however we encountered constraints associated with current data availability if requisite data were collected for a larger number of lakes spanning wider environmental gradients e g climate watershed conditions trophic state water residence times contributions of lakes to landscape carbon cycles could be better estimated at broad spatial scales hotchkiss et al 2018 jones et al 2018 seekell et al 2018 although we designed our modeling framework to be flexible across different lake ecosystems our study contained four north temperate lakes and one arctic lake all of which were deep and dimictic summer and winter stratification and spring and autumn mixing of the water column literature based parameters were obtained from previous research on these lake ecosystems and may not apply in all other lake ecosystems future work should include additional high latitude tropical or shallow lakes to test the generalizability of our model across a more diverse set of lake ecosystems than those included in this study nonetheless part of our intention for including model data and code with this manuscript was so that future work can build off our model and make adjustments as more data across more diverse lake ecosystems become available during model development we encountered a notable paucity of high frequency measurements of inflow doc concentration of which broader collection would facilitate dynamic oc modeling in more lakes although collection of these data may be expensive and logistically challenging the increasing availability of automated high frequency sensor equipment may alleviate long term costs associated with sensor deployment and manual data retrieval in addition relatively little is currently known about poc budgets despite their key interactions with doc einsele et al 2001 we need more poc observational data for incorporation into dynamic models of oc particularly in inflows for estimating pocalloch such studies would help constrain poc parameters and improve estimates of the fates of poc within overall oc budgets finally data limitations required us to make simplifying assumptions about the volume of groundwater inputs and the lakes themselves although these are common assumptions in similar mass balance studies the inability to account for groundwater may lead to underestimates of allochthonous inputs and may complicate comparisons across lakes particularly isolated lakes the one lake with non zero estimated groundwater volume however was trout lake for which modeled allochthonous inputs were lowest across lakes in this study nonetheless a key implication of our study is the need for more observational data particularly pertaining to surface water and groundwater volume and doc concentrations poc cycling and burial rates additionally data limitations may explain poor nse scores 0 for doc for harp lake and trout lake which indicate that modeled doc was no more accurate than long term doc means table 4 for harp lake modeled doc was generally lower than observed doc fig 3 potentially due to artificially low do measurements which reduced nse for do for harp lake underestimated do would lead to underestimated respiration which would reduce autochthonous inputs for trout lake the model did not capture short term spring time dips in doc fig 3 which may potentially be explained by ice melt dynamics not represented in interpolated inflow doc data in addition nse was also poor for do for toolik lake modeled do was consistently higher than observations fig 3 this suggests overestimated autochthonous inputs and therefore underestimated allochthonous inputs which may be attributed to undetected pulses in inflow doc in surface water or groundwater additionally food web dynamics e g grazing may also help explain large fluctuations in allochthonous inputs or poor nse values in general whereas short term spikes are unlikely to affect long term oc fate estimates consistent biases in observations may skew model outputs therefore dynamic models such as ours can be used to identify important sources of uncertainty in overall oc budgets that can be targeted in future monitoring and research 4 4 lessons from a dynamic model implications in a dynamic world prior to our study it was known that lakes actively process emit and store globally significant amounts of c cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 raymond et al 2013 our results demonstrate that a dynamic model can considerably advance knowledge on the role of lakes in landscape and ultimately global c cycling by highlighting dominant inputs and fates of oc in individual systems lakes more readily respire more autochthonous than allochthonous oc wetzel 2001 in our study our one lake dominated by autochthonous inputs trout lake exhibited the greatest respiration relative to burial table 5 therefore lakes as global c sources or sinks may depend both on the balances between 1 respiration and burial and 2 allochthonous and autochthonous inputs the balance between respiration and burial can vary according to regional climate and respiration is typically greater than burial in boreal lakes compared to those in higher latitudes anthony et al 2014 this represents a potential negative feedback for the global c cycle under a warming climate with poleward boreal advance and thawing of frozen high latitude lakes anthony et al 2014 our model identified another important global change implication associated with warming water temperatures across all lakes in our study warm surface temperatures were generally associated with a shift toward autochthonous relative to allochthonous inputs as well as an increase in respiration relative to burial fig 5 this likely is due to elevated npp during summer growing seasons accompanied by relatively high respiration rates of autochthonous relative to allochthonous inputs table 4 although the balance between respiration and burial appears to shift toward respiration with increases in temperature it is also possible for burial to increase with temperature if temperature increases coincide with greater oc loads e g warm season precipitation events increasing pocalloch and consequently burial as a function of bpocalloch as such our results suggest that processes favoring allochthonous inputs will generally have a greater effect on oc burial than processes that drive autochthonous inputs more broadly however lakes have generally become more productive under recent climate warming kraemer et al 2016 which our study suggests favors autochthonous over allochthonous inputs and respiration over burial therefore changes in both precipitation including magnitude timing duration and form de wit et al 2018 and air temperature have key implications for the fate of oc in lake ecosystems under a changing climate reed et al 2018 however effects of warming will vary according to the balance between allochthonous and autochthonous inputs which is mediated by precipitation due to its effect on the origin of the total oc load although our model was not designed as a predictive tool our findings illustrate the usefulness of a dynamic mass balance model for highlighting key global change processes and interactions that ultimately influence the role of lakes in global c cycling improved estimates of the contribution of lakes to global c budgets should account for the source and degradability of total oc loads and consequent effects on respiration and burial acknowledgments this project was a product of the global lake ecological observatory network
