multi objective framework was developed to achieve an optimal reservoir operating strategy under sudden pollution injection to assess a wide range of responses to potential future pollution injection events a large number of reservoir release and pollution injection scenarios 1000 release modes and three injection location scenarios were considered the ce qual w2 model served to simulate pollutant concentration and reservoir cleanup time rct under each scenario to minimize the reservoir water quality modeling s computational burden a multilayer perceptron mlp neural network was trained and validated against simulated responses to various scenarios to reduce the dimensions of the problem forcings of this surrogate model were made orthogonal by principal component analysis pca this surrogate model helps estimate response variables at any intermediate scenario and can be readily coupled with a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii optimization model to underpin pareto optimal solutions four objective functions were considered i non supplied water demand ii weighted combination of frequency and magnitude of pollution violation iii ratio of pollution rate released from reservoir outlets to the total rate of injection and iv difference between the reservoir volume and its normal water storage finally a multi method decision making procedure was applied to select the best compromise solution for all stakeholders i e ministry of energy ministry of agriculture center for environmental health and regional water authority this study is the first to propose a reservoir optimal operation model using an mlp pca model coupled with several conflict resolution models findings showed that the closer the pollution injection point was to the reservoir outlet the shorter the rct following a 40 day simulation the solution selected for the injection site closest to the reservoir outlet resulted in a 4 day rct under identified compromise solutions for scenarios of pollutant e coli injections 470 m 3290 m and 6580 m upstream from the dam the rct decreased by 1 2 and 2 days respectively keywords sudden pollution injection principal component analysis non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii social choice rules fallback bargaining 1 introduction development and expansion of agricultural and industrial activities pose significant environmental hazards associated with the release of contaminants to surface and groundwater resources wang et al 2013 among the most important infrastructure constructed to supply agricultural industrial and urban water demands dams are particularly vulnerable to contaminants from various sources entering their reservoirs haghighat et al 2020 maymandi et al 2018 pourshahabi et al 2020 these pollution injection events can follow such occurrences as overturned chemical carriers sudden storage tank leaks or even terrorist attacks shokri et al 2014 zhang and mei 2013 therefore it is necessary to monitor pollution in reservoirs and develop reservoir management strategies to deal with critical conditions li et al 2014 which can disturb water supply to different sectors and have significant socioeconomic repercussions the urgency of this problem has prompted several studies on optimal reservoir management under such critical situations e g saadatpour and afshar 2013 shokri et al 2014 zhang and xin 2017 darmian et al 2018 the ce qual w2 model is widely used in the literature to simulate pollution propagation in a reservoir analyze reservoir responses and estimate cleanup time e g haddad et al 2013 saadatpour and afshar 2013 shokri et al 2014 amirkhani et al 2016 this numerical model is however associated with a high run time when considering multiple scenarios this issue can be alleviated by using artificial neural network ann based surrogate models to emulate reservoir response to pollution injection saadatpour et al 2020 training and validation of the ann based surrogate model requires a large input output dataset which is procured by executing the ce qual w2 numerical model however the redundant information in the resulting dataset prevents the ann model from effectively uncovering the response functions in the input output data making the surrogate model imprecise and time consuming especially when coupled with a multi objective optimization model principal component analysis pca can solve this problem by rendering the input output dataset orthogonal and decreasing its dimension traditionally application of the pca technique has been limited to extracting strictly linear features from datasets rattan and hsieh 2005 however its ability to simplify model architecture and accelerate its training justifies using pca to reduce the size of any dataset noori et al 2011 while the successful use of pca to reduce artificial intelligence models input matrix dimensions has been reported in several scientific fields noori et al 2010 zhang 2007 zhang et al 2006 choi and park 2001 its use to decrease simulation optimization run time under multiple reservoir release and injection pollution scenarios remains unexplored in sudden pollution injection situations satisfying water demands and achieving optimal management of water quality are the main goals of reservoir operation darmian et al 2018 for these situations non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii shokri et al 2014 and multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso saadatpour and afshar 2013 among other multi objective optimization frameworks can be applied in the latter two studies however only two of the following four objectives were considered simultaneously i minimizing non supplied water demands ii maximizing pollution release from reservoir outlets such that reservoir cleanup time rct is minimized iii minimizing the magnitude and frequency of water quality standard violations and iv minimizing the difference between current and normal reservoir storage this approach poses the risk of achieving suboptimal strategies in the case of sudden pollution injection different objectives can lead to conflict between stakeholders traditionally the best cross stakeholder compromise reservoir management strategies have been achieved almost exclusively through the use of the nash conflict resolution model haddad et al 2013 yang et al 2014 recently more efficient conflict resolution models e g fallback bargaining fb and social choice rules scrs have been employed in various environmental fields e g mahjouri and bizhani manzar 2013 ghodsi et al 2016 however the implementation of these conflict resolution models has yet to be considered in choosing the optimal dam operation policy under sudden pollution injection in the present study a novel conflict resolution based methodology for multi objective reservoir emergency operation under sudden pollution injection was developed for a case where a certain amount of pollution here coliforms was abruptly injected into the reservoir the proposed model attempted to address the drawbacks of previous studies using the following approaches reducing the optimization model run time using an mlp pca model as a surrogate model decreasing the risk of achieving suboptimal strategies by simultaneously considering a comprehensive set of four objectives in the optimization model assessing the impact of injection location on reservoir operation by defining three distinct injection location scenarios choosing the best compromise solution among the pareto optimal results using the fb and scrs conflict resolution models the details of the proposed methodology and a case study are presented in sections 2 and 3 respectively the developed models effectiveness in ascertaining the best reservoir operation policy under sudden pollution injection is presented in sections 4 results and 5 conclusions 2 methodology illustrated in a flowchart fig 1 the proposed multi objective framework for reservoir operation under sudden pollution injection consisted of six steps 1 meteorological hydrographic and reservoir geometry data were gathered and prepared 2 the ce qual w2 numerical model drew upon water quality and geometric data prepared in the first step to simulate pollution propagation within the dam storage the volume area elevation table generated by the ce qual w2 numerical model was then compared to the actual volume area elevation curve 3 two general types of ce qual w2 generated scenarios were used to train the mlp surrogate model reservoir release scenarios considering different constraints including reservoir storage capacity and the maximum capacity of outlets and injection pollution scenarios considering different locations of injection the ce qual w2 numerical model was then executed to determine reservoir cleanup time rct and pollution concentration level at reservoir outlets for each scenario results were saved as an input output dataset for the subsequent steps 4 the dimension of the previously derived dataset having been reduced using a pca tool a randomly chosen 70 and 30 of the resulting input output dataset respectively served to train and validate the mlp neural network training and validation sets were selected to i prevent extrapolation i e training data covered the full range of variability and ii prevent biased interpretation by ensuring that the mean and standard deviation of the training and validation data were as similar as possible in identifying through a trial and error process the best fitted mlp pca model the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean squared error rmse served in both training and validation steps as criteria for assessing the model s accuracy nourani et al 2011 eventually a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii multi objective optimization model was developed and coupled with the mlp pca model to render a tradeoff surface consisting of pareto optimal solutions 5 employing two conflict resolution methods fallback bargaining fb and social choice rules scrs the best compromise solution for all stakeholders was identified 6 in choosing the best conflict solution approach the median voting rule mvr conflict resolution model was applied in the next subsections the main portions of the proposed methodology are briefly described 2 1 the ce qual w2 numerical model widely used for modeling the eutrophication and thermal layers of reservoirs the ce qual w2 numerical model is a two dimensional hydrodynamics and water quality model applicable to the simulation of pollution propagation in desired layers or segments of water bodies edinger and buchak 1975 saadatpour and afshar 2013 in the present study the use of the ce qual w2 model served to achieve two goals i simulate a reservoir based on qualitative and geometric information and ii determine rct and pollutant concentrations at outlets for each scenario considering interactions between multiple pollutants and the resulting uncertainties seems necessary to achieve an optimal strategy for water quality management nikoo et al 2016 tavakoli et al 2014 but since the intrusion of human waste into water resources causes various diseases and alters the taste and smell of water escherichia coli e coli level indicative of potential pathogen pollution and excrement content was considered a representative indicator of reservoir water quality coliform concentration was modeled as cole and wells 2006 1 c col d col t θ 20 φ col β col δ φ col δ z where c col is the rate of change in coliform concentration d col is the first order coliform concentration per diem decay rate at 20 c t is a temperature correction factor used to modify the decay rate d col usually 1 04 for coliform bacteria cole and wells 2006 θ is the water temperature c β col is settling velocity m day 1 φ col is the coliform concentration and z is the vertical coordinate two factors contribute to the elimination of coliforms decay and settling the first part of eq 1 d col t θ 20 φ col represents coliform first order decay and the second part β col δ φ col δ z represents the coliform settling factor cole and wells 2006 reservoir model calibration occurred in two stages i reservoir geometry calibration and ii reservoir operation calibration cole and wells 2006 given a lack of measured spatial and temporal distribution data for φ col the calibration process was more challenging however as this study focused on surrogate based optimization of the model rather than its calibration d col and β col were set to 0 73 day 1 and 1 38 m day 1 respectively auer and niehaus 1993 calibration of the ce qual w2 hydrodynamic simulation of iran s narmab dam reservoir drew on 2012 data including release values inflow stream temperature topography and meteorological information reservoir geometry was calibrated from geometric information used in developing a finite difference representation of the reservoir bathymetric cross sections were generated from a topographic map and a volume area elevation table was developed to serve as a basis of comparison for the model generated volume area elevation table calibration of the hydrodynamic features concentrated on temperature profiles and elevation of the water surface within the reservoir the hydrodynamic model was calibrated using daily water surface elevation wse and monthly vertical temperature profiles for 2012 fig 2 presents a comparison of measured wse and model simulated wse 2 2 mlp pca model based on its accurate performance in several water resources related studies adamowski et al 2012 parsaie and haghiabi 2015 taravatrooy et al 2018 an ann model with an mlp architecture was employed in the current study in a supervised training procedure this black box model was adjusted to minimize the error e between observed and estimated values araghinejad et al 2018 2 e j 1 j n o j e j 2 n where n is the number of data o j is the observed target value for the j th data point and e j is the estimated target value for the j th data point here inputs to the mlp neural network were reservoir outlets daily discharge values for all scenarios considered 1000 release scenarios for two outlets and 40 days 80 1000 and outputs were daily pollutant e coli concentrations for each input 80 pollutant concentrations per release scenario 80 1000 estimating the associated pollutant concentration for each injection location scenario involved forcing the ce qual w2 model with 1000 reservoir release scenarios this was repeated for three injection locations and eventually yielded four 80 1000 data matrices representing the mlp input output dataset one matrix included the 1000 different release modes and the other three the reservoir response pollutant concentration at reservoir outlets under the three different injection location scenarios computationally an mlp neural network model may be overfitted if it contains more parameters than can be calibrated by the input output dataset by removing redundant information from the dataset the application of pca can effectively reduce the number of nodes in the input and output layers thereby mitigating the overfitting issue in applying pca principal components of each standardized dataset are calculated and their individual contributions to the total variance quantified the principal components pcs can be specified as helena et al 2000 3 pc i a i 1 x 1 a i 2 x 2 a ip x p where ai are related eigenvectors p is the number of pcs and xi are related input variables in a second step rows contributing less than a preassigned threshold fraction of the total variation are eliminated for a case where the pca processing algorithm is fed two 80 1000 matrices one for reservoir release and another for released pollutant concentration at the reservoir outlets fig 3 shows the elimination of 72 and 78 principal components respectively thereby generating the input target dataset for the mlp model further details regarding the pca tool can be found in ilin and raiko 2010 on a pc equipped with an x64 based processor intel r core tm i7 6700k cpu 4 00 ghz 32 gb ram the ce qual w2 model s average run time for each release scenario was 65 s requiring 54 h to prepare the training data 3 1000 model runs the mlp pca model was implemented as a surrogate for the ce qual w2 model in the optimization procedure avoiding execution of the ce qual w2 simulation model with nsga ii the total surrogate based optimization run time was then about 10 100 s 2 8 h using the same pc system during which the surrogate model was run 151 200 times 2 3 nsga ii multi objective optimization model developed by deb et al 2002 and widely used in many fields of research e g nikoo et al 2014 alizadeh et al 2017 raei et al 2017 nsga ii is one of the most efficient and powerful multi objective optimization models in the present study a four objective nsga ii optimization model was used to identify a set of pareto optimal solutions four objective functions were formulated for the ministry of agriculture ma center for environmental health ceh ministry of energy me and regional water authority rwa as follows the objective function of minimizing non supplied water demand z ma was representative of the ma s preference to meet agricultural water demand 4 z ma m i n i m i z e t 1 t n t r t a d t 1 2 5 t r t r t 1 r t 2 where n is number of simulation days t is time in days a d t is the agricultural water demand for the t th day r t 1 r t 2 are the t th day s reservoir outlet releases for outlets 1 and 2 respectively and tr t is the total release from the dam on the t th day the objective function of minimizing the weighted combination of relative frequency and total magnitude of water quality standard violation z ceh was representative of the ceh s objective of adopting strategies that protect people s health from environmental hazards 6 z ceh m i n i m i z e w 1 n sv n frequency w 2 t 1 n sv m t c t c max n sv magnitude where w 1 and w 2 are weights assigned to the frequency and magnitude of pollution violation based on questionnaires completed by experts analyzed using the analytic hierarchy process ahp method saaty 1987 in the present study they were assigned values of w 1 0 5375 and w 2 0 4625 for further information about this process refer to supplementary material section s 2 c max is the maximum value of pollutant concentration at the reservoir outlets obtained by the ce qual w2 model in the second step of the proposed methodology it is considered to remain constant throughout the optimization process mt c t is the magnitude of the quality standard violation occurring at the reservoir outlets on the t th day of n sv and n sv is the number of days of water quality standard violation sewage and animal waste can contain several kinds of disease causing organisms that can lead to serious illnesses if consumed the appearance of e coli in water is a good indication of pollution of sewage or animal waste therefore in the case of sudden pollution injection into the reservoir based on the ceh s priorities it was preferable to minimize the quantity of hazardous material released from the dam outlets to ensure that the available water supply was safe and reliable the objective function of minimizing the difference between the rate of pollution e coli injection and pollutant release from reservoir outlets z me represented the preference of the me 7 z me m i n i m i z e t 1 t n 1 tp r t tip where tip is the total rate of the injected pollutant and tp r t is the total rate of pollutant e coli released from dam outlets on the t th day of simulation and is equal to c t out q t where c t out and q t are pollution concentration at the outlets and reservoir discharge on the t th day of simulation respectively in general the energy sector prefers to release more water from the reservoir to allow greater energy production however under conditions of sudden pollution injection it is not possible to release water indefinitely due to downstream qualitative requirements of the reservoir therefore the me preferred the rct to be minimized so that it could use the maximum capacity of the hydropower to generate hydroelectricity as soon as possible minimizing the rct variable was a straightforward objective function that could be defined to accomplish this however the trade off surface sensitivity analysis showed that by selecting rct as the independent variable of the objective function it was not possible to effectively include the consequences of different release scenarios on the objective function z me therefore considering the decision variables in this study reservoir outlets daily discharge values the idea of developing the objective function z me based on discharge values was proposed as an alternative strategy the objective function of minimizing the difference between the current reservoir storage and the normal water storage capacity z rwa represented the preference of the rwa 8 z rwa m i n i m i z e t 1 t n 1 s t s n where s n is the normal storage capacity of the reservoir which includes both inactive and active storage and refers to a volume of the reservoir below the normal water level nwl in the case study investigated here the nwl is 207 m above mean sea level which corresponds to a normal storage capacity of 115 million cubic meters madadi et al 2015 and s t is the present reservoir storage the rwa preferred to maintain the existing water storage of the reservoir for future supply in the nsga ii optimization model with 80 decision variables 40 day simulation for two reservoir outlets the population size and number of generations were set to 800 and 180 respectively 2 4 conflict resolution methods with multiple stakeholders the decision making process is often complicated by conflicting goals and different priorities in such situations the final decision should consider all stakeholders priorities disagreements and relative decision making power conflict resolution models exist to address these issues in the present study the widely used fb and scr conflict resolution models served to specify a compromise operational rule among all alternative rules non dominated solutions on the trade off curve fb was implemented with unanimity fb method and q approval fb method while the scrs were implemented with condorcet choice cc and borda scoring bs options finally mvr also an scr was used to select the best compromise solution among the four selected solutions provided by the aforementioned conflict resolution models fig 4 a brief description of each conflict resolution model follows 2 4 1 fallback bargaining fb method introduced by brams and kilgour 2001 the fb method begins with the bargainers most preferred alternative if they all agree the option is selected however if there are conflicts all stakeholders fall back to their next preferred alternative this process continues until the bargainers reach an alternative of adequate satisfaction sheikhmohammady and madani 2008 in other words the fb method maximizes the minimum satisfaction of bargainers two different approaches of the fb method were applied here unanimity fb and q approval fb unanimity fallback bargaining method based on the unanimity fb method the alternative of highest unanimous support and quality is chosen brams and kilgour 2001 sheikhmohammady and madani 2008 bargainers first rate all alternatives non dominated trade off solutions according to their priorities resulting in each bargainer selecting their most profitable choice a total of m alternatives ranked by n bargainers generates an n m matrix after rating alternatives and establishing a preferential matrix bargainers begin the negotiating process by choosing their most favored alternative and then drop back to their second third and so on before they all hit a point of acceptance the method maximizes the bargainers minimum satisfaction with the outcome of the unanimity being at least middling in each bargainers rating when all bargainers show an impasse in their ratings the impasse state may be chosen as the outcome brams and kilgour 2001 b q approval fallback bargaining method under the q approval fb method the alternative that q of n bargainers support where 1 q n is chosen brams and kilgour 2001 sheikhmohammady and madani 2008 2 4 2 social choice rules scrs arrow 1951 introduced the modern social choice theory which focuses on preferences when decision makers in fields such as political voting economy and managerial conflicts espouse different preferences amongst available alternatives applied to decision making a social choice rule scr chooses a set of feasible social states for each configuration of decision makers preferences and other characteristics fishburn 2015 some of the most common scr approaches to find a socially optimal solution include condorcet choice borda scoring and median voting rule briefly described below condorcet choice cc a condorcet winner is an alternative that is preferred over other alternatives by a majority of decision makers black et al 1958 this method reaches the preferable alternative by a two by two comparison between all possible choices with one point assigned to the preferred choice in each comparison step at the end the condorcet winner is the choice with the maximum number of points sheikhmohammady and madani 2008 borda scoring bs based on this method for n alternatives each decision maker assigns a score n j to his j th most preferred alternative in other words the score that an alternative receives is the number of times the alternative is preferred over others for each alternative scores assigned by each decision maker are summed then the alternative s with the highest total score is are selected as a borda compromise solution black et al 1958 median voting rule mvr mvr selects the alternative receiving the highest rank where the only important factor is the majority not the number of supporters bassett and persky 1999 3 case study a case study was conducted for the narmab dam which provides agricultural and domestic water along with hydroelectric demands to the cities of minoudasht gonbad and azadshahr in iran s golestan province fig 5 extending over a normal surface area of 5 4 km2 lat 36 45 02 37 13 40 n long 55 16 20 55 38 25 e the reservoir normally stores roughly 115 mcm of water madadi et al 2015 a plot of the reservoir s longitudinal segmentation adopted for the ce qual w2 model fig 6 i shows i where the narmab river s two branches the khormalou and chehel chay enter the reservoir yellow tipped arrows segments 15 and 9 respectively and ii the location of pollution injection sites red arrows distal 2 mid distance 9 and proximal 15 segments situated 6580 3290 and 470 m respectively from the dam outlets which received rectangular pulses of pollution e coli of 1 106 col dl 1 this level of pollutant entered the reservoir on the 91st julian day j day and continued for 5 days at a flow rate of 8 m3 s 1 fig 6 ii represents the ce qual w2 layers for the reservoir side view showing the 16 longitudinal segments and 23 layers the narmab dam has two outlets one at an elevation of 168 m and the other at 166 m above sea level and their locations are specified in fig 6 ii in case of a sudden pollution injection an immediate optimal reservoir operation response is critical to minimize damage this is achieved by addressing stakeholders disparate preferences and optimally meeting their collective demands the formulation of the objective function z me for example was developed on the basis that an operation policy should increase the pollutant release rate in order to increase the fraction of pollution that is eliminated by releasing water through the reservoir s outlets in such a case in addition to the reservoir s capacity for self purification the possibility of discharging the pollutant in water released through the reservoir s outlets has been considered to accelerate the cleaning of the reservoir likewise the objective function z ma specifically addressed the quantitative requirements water supply for water downstream from the reservoir without attention to any quality goals for these waters in fact the downstream quantitative and qualitative requirements of the reservoir were not assembled in one objective function but rather in two separate and contrasting objective functions objective functions z ma and z ceh 4 results to identify the optimal reservoir operation policy in case of a sudden pollution injection at each of the three specified injection locations fig 6 reservoir response sensitivity was evaluated using the ce qual w2 numerical model as expected reservoir responses to pollution injection in different segments varied significantly fig 7 given the fixed release values from the reservoir as mentioned earlier three important factors in the elimination of coliforms as a pollution indicator in the reservoir are decay settling and pollution release for a fixed release policy if pollution is injected into the reservoir at a location distant from the reservoir outlets the reservoir plays an important role in pollution washout and the pollutant has more time to decay and settle on the other hand the closer the pollutant injection is to the outlet of the reservoir the greater the first day maximum pollutant concentration at the reservoir outlets and the lower the rct the point of peak pollutant concentration for each injection segment indicates the role of the reservoir s shape in pollution washout for example injection at segment 15 proximal to the reservoir outlet resulted in a greater maximum concentration peak of pollution and lower rct than at the more distal locations in this case time to peak pollutant concentration and its values fig 7 illustrated that the more proximal the injection location the more the reservoir release strategy and operation played an important role compared to settling or decay factors 4 1 mlp pca results given the significantly different reservoir responses to pollution injection in different segments of the reservoir the release concentration relationship for each injection location was modeled by a distinct mlp pca model trained and validated with relevant data for example to train and validate the surrogate model for segment 2 two datasets release values and pollution concentrations for injection in segment 2 served as input and output data respectively see section 2 2 in establishing each mlp pca model the pca tool was first applied to the values of release scenarios and associated concentration levels at the outlets to reduce the dataset s dimensions and generate a smaller input output dataset appropriate for training the mlp model for each dataset after standardizing its data and calculating their variance covariance matrix its 80 principal components were obtained for each dataset the contribution of the first 20 principal components to the total variance is shown in fig 8 in this study the maximum fraction of removed rows was set to 0 018 for the inputs and 0 08 0 1 and 0 05 for the targets of injection sites 2 9 15 respectively achieved through a trial and error process the reduction of the dataset s dimensions through the deletion of its principal components had no significant effect on mlp model performance rows with a contribution to the total variation of less than the assigned maximum fractional value were removed for all pollution injection scenarios this process led to the elimination of 72 and 78 principal components of the input and target datasets respectively accordingly in all cases the size of input and output matrices were reduced to 8 1000 and 2 1000 respectively subsequently an mlp model was used to establish the relationship between the prepared input and target datasets for this purpose 70 and 30 of the pca processed dataset were randomly separated as training and validation sets respectively for the mlp model the best architecture for each single hidden layer mlp pca model table 1 was determined using a trial and error process to prevent the network from overfitting the training set and failing to generalize the invisible test dataset training ended when the error in the validation dataset began to increase this procedure was carried out by modifying the number of hidden layer neurons within a range of 5 30 statistical evaluations coefficient of determination and rmse of the mlp pca models training and validation phase accuracy for the three different injection sites are shown in table 1 since the output of the mlp pca model for each release scenario was an estimate based on the first two principal components of pollution concentration one must implement a reverse pca process on the values calculated by the mlp pca model as a last step for each release scenario the outcome of this step represented the temporal variation of the pollutant concentration at the two reservoir outlets 80 values of contaminant concentration based on the model accuracy evaluation criterion r2 temporal variations of the pollutant concentration computed by the proposed surrogate model compared well to values computed by the calibrated ce qual w2 model under all release scenarios a robust correlation for all release scenarios r2 0 93 existed between the time efficient mlp pca surrogate model s estimated pollutant concentrations and those of the ce qual w2 model fig 9 compares the results of release concentration modeling by the mlp pca and ce qual w2 models for a given scenario the surrogate models training process was significantly accelerated by replacing the mlp model which had 80 nodes in the input and output layers with the proposed mlp pca model for example the average training time of an mlp network with a 80 20 80 structure was 2760 s for each of the three injection location scenarios while these times were reduced to 26 s upon the pca based reduction of the input and output layer nodes to 8 and 2 4 2 optimization model results in the next step a four objective nsga ii optimization algorithm was developed and coupled with the relevant mlp pca surrogate model for each pollution injection location which in turn rendered four dimensional trade off surfaces consisting of 29 36 and 30 possible solutions for segments 2 9 and 15 respectively as mentioned before the optimization model s four objectives were related to the priorities of the different stakeholders in the case study the trade off surfaces associated with pollution injection sites at segments 2 and 15 are shown in fig 10 a and b respectively while for the pollution injection site at segment 9 the trade off surface is presented in fig s1 supplementary material in the trade off curves obtained for all three injection location scenarios it was clearly seen that the objective functions z ma and z me were in contradiction with the objective functions z ceh and z rwa this meant that the reduction of non supplied water demand and rct was in line with increasing the amount of pollution released from reservoir outlets and the difference between the current and normal reservoir storage 4 3 conflict resolution results four conflict resolution methods including bs cc unanimity fb and q approval fb were then employed to select the best compromise solution among the pareto optimal results illustrated in figs 10 and s1 table 2 shows the objective values of the selected compromise solutions achieved by each method for each pollution injection site results listed in table 2 show that while the selected compromise solutions by scrs bs and cc for each injection location scenario were the same the two fb methods q approval fb and unanimity fb derived two different compromise solutions also the comparison of the selected compromise solutions revealed that fb methods paid more attention to supplying water demand and reducing rct by selecting solutions that released more water the mvr conflict resolution model was then applied to achieve a solution with the maximum support of stakeholders between the four selected solutions listed in table 2 for the pollutant injection sites at segments 2 9 and 15 the superior solutions among the four conflict resolution methods selected by the median voting rule mvr were 1 14 and 16 respectively 4 4 analysis of solution behavior based on haddad et al 2013 we expected the trend of temporal variations in pollution concentration at reservoir outlets and the operation policy to be independent of one another i e regardless of the operation policy the pollution concentration at outlets would first increase and then decrease this is confirmed in fig 11 where pollutant concentrations calculated by the mlp pca model for both upper and lower outlets of the reservoir are shown for all three pollution injection scenarios and the two alternative reservoir management policies i no management policy i e pollution ignored and water released from reservoir as under normal conditions as determined by the official dam release rules ii policy selected by the mvr model indeed what lead to the difference in efficiency of the managed and unmanaged policies was their respective rates of pollutant release from the reservoir namely the product of pollution concentration at the outlets c out and reservoir discharge q i e c out q application of an operation policy selected by the mvr model as a compromise solution prompted an oscillating pattern in the rate of pollutant release whereas this pattern was almost uniform under unmanaged operation fig 12 a b and s2 the result of a constantly changing release policy fig 12c and d this oscillating pattern avoided introducing a fixed and beyond acceptable standards pollution rate to downstream waters in this way a large injection of pollutant would be followed by a small release from the dam such that downstream waters were not intermittently exposed to large pollution events the inequality of the area beneath the two curves fig 12a b and s2 was representative of the difference in the policies of releasing water from the reservoir outlets under both managed and unmanaged modes the proposed optimization model considering the four previously mentioned stakeholders objectives tried to reduce the risk of introducing pollution to downstream waters while at the same time meeting downstream water demands to the greatest possible extent accordingly this approach did not simultaneously use all outlets maximum capacity when the upper outlet was used to maximum capacity only part of the lower outlet s capacity was available indeed peaks of curves for injection sites in segments 2 and 15 did not occur at the same time pointing to the efficiency of the proposed optimization model to establish a compromise between stakeholders fig 12c and d for equivalent plots for pollutant injection at segment 9 see fig s3 the pollutant was eliminated from the reservoir sooner under injection at segment 15 than under other scenarios fig 11 in addition for segment 2 the peak duration of pollution concentration exceeded that under the other scenarios showing that the reservoir operator alert time to select the best operation strategy would be greater for segment 15 it would be less start and end times of pollution standard violation at the outlet of the reservoir and the rct resulting from each of the managed and unmanaged modes are presented for all three scenarios table 3 optimal release policy scenarios for pollutant injections in segments 2 9 and 15 led to decreases in rct of 2 2 and 1 days respectively the effect of release policy on pollution transfer within the reservoir and the effect of the reservoir on decreasing the cleaning time are illustrated in fig 13 for a pollutant injection in segment 2 and under the optimal release policy the reservoir returned to pre injection conditions in 112 julian days while under the unmanaged release the reservoir did not reach pre injection conditions until 5 days later 5 summary and conclusions assessing the performance of reservoirs and finding optimal strategies for reservoir operation in critical situations such as a sudden pollution injection requires one to balance the downstream demands of different sectors and maintain safe environmental conditions within both the dam reservoir and downstream waters in order to achieve these goals several tools were used in this study the ce qual w2 numerical model a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii multi objective optimization model a multilayer perceptron mlp neural network principal component analysis pca and several conflict resolution models this study proposed a novel and efficient method to implement a coupled mlp pca model with a nsga ii optimization model to consider four objectives the methodology involved first gathering reservoir data and employing the ce qual w2 numerical model numerous reservoir release and injection pollution scenarios were generated which in turn forced the ce qual w2 to determine reservoir cleanup time rct and associated pollution concentration for each scenario this procedure resulted in an input output dataset dimensions of which were reduced using a pca tool next an nsga ii multi objective optimization model was developed and coupled with the mlp pca model to achieve a set of pareto optimal solutions using four conflict resolution models condorcet choice borda scoring q approval and unanimity approaches different compromise solutions were achieved from which the best compromise solution was selected using a median voting rule mvr approach this conflict resolution procedure had not previously been applied to the optimal operation of a reservoir under a sudden pollution injection the application of an optimal release policy in the case of pollutant injections in reservoir segments 2 9 and 15 distal to proximal led to a decrease in rct of 2 2 and 1 days respectively a pollution injection location closer to rather than farther from the reservoir outlets led to a lower rct with the reservoir playing a lesser role in the elimination of pollution because of the smaller effects of decay and settling under these conditions injection location close to outlets the reservoir operator alert time to select the best operation strategy was lower hence the proposed methodology is an effective approach with a high efficiency for conflict resolution in sudden pollution injection conditions for a reservoir in this study we only investigated the impact of location of pollution injection on pollution concentration in reservoir outlets however other factors such as pollution intensity and time of pollution should be investigated the authors suggestions for future investigations include i consider more injection scenarios based on the amount location and time of pollution injection ii evaluate the risk to the system under conditions of sudden pollution injection iii consider the uncertainty of meteorological and hydrological factors caused by different times of pollution injection iv consider the effect of surrogate model error on the optimization model and the optimal solution and v investigate the possibility of real time reservoir operation under suddenly injected pollution by integrating

multi objective framework was developed to achieve an optimal reservoir operating strategy under sudden pollution injection to assess a wide range of responses to potential future pollution injection events a large number of reservoir release and pollution injection scenarios 1000 release modes and three injection location scenarios were considered the ce qual w2 model served to simulate pollutant concentration and reservoir cleanup time rct under each scenario to minimize the reservoir water quality modeling s computational burden a multilayer perceptron mlp neural network was trained and validated against simulated responses to various scenarios to reduce the dimensions of the problem forcings of this surrogate model were made orthogonal by principal component analysis pca this surrogate model helps estimate response variables at any intermediate scenario and can be readily coupled with a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii optimization model to underpin pareto optimal solutions four objective functions were considered i non supplied water demand ii weighted combination of frequency and magnitude of pollution violation iii ratio of pollution rate released from reservoir outlets to the total rate of injection and iv difference between the reservoir volume and its normal water storage finally a multi method decision making procedure was applied to select the best compromise solution for all stakeholders i e ministry of energy ministry of agriculture center for environmental health and regional water authority this study is the first to propose a reservoir optimal operation model using an mlp pca model coupled with several conflict resolution models findings showed that the closer the pollution injection point was to the reservoir outlet the shorter the rct following a 40 day simulation the solution selected for the injection site closest to the reservoir outlet resulted in a 4 day rct under identified compromise solutions for scenarios of pollutant e coli injections 470 m 3290 m and 6580 m upstream from the dam the rct decreased by 1 2 and 2 days respectively keywords sudden pollution injection principal component analysis non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii social choice rules fallback bargaining 1 introduction development and expansion of agricultural and industrial activities pose significant environmental hazards associated with the release of contaminants to surface and groundwater resources wang et al 2013 among the most important infrastructure constructed to supply agricultural industrial and urban water demands dams are particularly vulnerable to contaminants from various sources entering their reservoirs haghighat et al 2020 maymandi et al 2018 pourshahabi et al 2020 these pollution injection events can follow such occurrences as overturned chemical carriers sudden storage tank leaks or even terrorist attacks shokri et al 2014 zhang and mei 2013 therefore it is necessary to monitor pollution in reservoirs and develop reservoir management strategies to deal with critical conditions li et al 2014 which can disturb water supply to different sectors and have significant socioeconomic repercussions the urgency of this problem has prompted several studies on optimal reservoir management under such critical situations e g saadatpour and afshar 2013 shokri et al 2014 zhang and xin 2017 darmian et al 2018 the ce qual w2 model is widely used in the literature to simulate pollution propagation in a reservoir analyze reservoir responses and estimate cleanup time e g haddad et al 2013 saadatpour and afshar 2013 shokri et al 2014 amirkhani et al 2016 this numerical model is however associated with a high run time when considering multiple scenarios this issue can be alleviated by using artificial neural network ann based surrogate models to emulate reservoir response to pollution injection saadatpour et al 2020 training and validation of the ann based surrogate model requires a large input output dataset which is procured by executing the ce qual w2 numerical model however the redundant information in the resulting dataset prevents the ann model from effectively uncovering the response functions in the input output data making the surrogate model imprecise and time consuming especially when coupled with a multi objective optimization model principal component analysis pca can solve this problem by rendering the input output dataset orthogonal and decreasing its dimension traditionally application of the pca technique has been limited to extracting strictly linear features from datasets rattan and hsieh 2005 however its ability to simplify model architecture and accelerate its training justifies using pca to reduce the size of any dataset noori et al 2011 while the successful use of pca to reduce artificial intelligence models input matrix dimensions has been reported in several scientific fields noori et al 2010 zhang 2007 zhang et al 2006 choi and park 2001 its use to decrease simulation optimization run time under multiple reservoir release and injection pollution scenarios remains unexplored in sudden pollution injection situations satisfying water demands and achieving optimal management of water quality are the main goals of reservoir operation darmian et al 2018 for these situations non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii shokri et al 2014 and multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso saadatpour and afshar 2013 among other multi objective optimization frameworks can be applied in the latter two studies however only two of the following four objectives were considered simultaneously i minimizing non supplied water demands ii maximizing pollution release from reservoir outlets such that reservoir cleanup time rct is minimized iii minimizing the magnitude and frequency of water quality standard violations and iv minimizing the difference between current and normal reservoir storage this approach poses the risk of achieving suboptimal strategies in the case of sudden pollution injection different objectives can lead to conflict between stakeholders traditionally the best cross stakeholder compromise reservoir management strategies have been achieved almost exclusively through the use of the nash conflict resolution model haddad et al 2013 yang et al 2014 recently more efficient conflict resolution models e g fallback bargaining fb and social choice rules scrs have been employed in various environmental fields e g mahjouri and bizhani manzar 2013 ghodsi et al 2016 however the implementation of these conflict resolution models has yet to be considered in choosing the optimal dam operation policy under sudden pollution injection in the present study a novel conflict resolution based methodology for multi objective reservoir emergency operation under sudden pollution injection was developed for a case where a certain amount of pollution here coliforms was abruptly injected into the reservoir the proposed model attempted to address the drawbacks of previous studies using the following approaches reducing the optimization model run time using an mlp pca model as a surrogate model decreasing the risk of achieving suboptimal strategies by simultaneously considering a comprehensive set of four objectives in the optimization model assessing the impact of injection location on reservoir operation by defining three distinct injection location scenarios choosing the best compromise solution among the pareto optimal results using the fb and scrs conflict resolution models the details of the proposed methodology and a case study are presented in sections 2 and 3 respectively the developed models effectiveness in ascertaining the best reservoir operation policy under sudden pollution injection is presented in sections 4 results and 5 conclusions 2 methodology illustrated in a flowchart fig 1 the proposed multi objective framework for reservoir operation under sudden pollution injection consisted of six steps 1 meteorological hydrographic and reservoir geometry data were gathered and prepared 2 the ce qual w2 numerical model drew upon water quality and geometric data prepared in the first step to simulate pollution propagation within the dam storage the volume area elevation table generated by the ce qual w2 numerical model was then compared to the actual volume area elevation curve 3 two general types of ce qual w2 generated scenarios were used to train the mlp surrogate model reservoir release scenarios considering different constraints including reservoir storage capacity and the maximum capacity of outlets and injection pollution scenarios considering different locations of injection the ce qual w2 numerical model was then executed to determine reservoir cleanup time rct and pollution concentration level at reservoir outlets for each scenario results were saved as an input output dataset for the subsequent steps 4 the dimension of the previously derived dataset having been reduced using a pca tool a randomly chosen 70 and 30 of the resulting input output dataset respectively served to train and validate the mlp neural network training and validation sets were selected to i prevent extrapolation i e training data covered the full range of variability and ii prevent biased interpretation by ensuring that the mean and standard deviation of the training and validation data were as similar as possible in identifying through a trial and error process the best fitted mlp pca model the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean squared error rmse served in both training and validation steps as criteria for assessing the model s accuracy nourani et al 2011 eventually a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii multi objective optimization model was developed and coupled with the mlp pca model to render a tradeoff surface consisting of pareto optimal solutions 5 employing two conflict resolution methods fallback bargaining fb and social choice rules scrs the best compromise solution for all stakeholders was identified 6 in choosing the best conflict solution approach the median voting rule mvr conflict resolution model was applied in the next subsections the main portions of the proposed methodology are briefly described 2 1 the ce qual w2 numerical model widely used for modeling the eutrophication and thermal layers of reservoirs the ce qual w2 numerical model is a two dimensional hydrodynamics and water quality model applicable to the simulation of pollution propagation in desired layers or segments of water bodies edinger and buchak 1975 saadatpour and afshar 2013 in the present study the use of the ce qual w2 model served to achieve two goals i simulate a reservoir based on qualitative and geometric information and ii determine rct and pollutant concentrations at outlets for each scenario considering interactions between multiple pollutants and the resulting uncertainties seems necessary to achieve an optimal strategy for water quality management nikoo et al 2016 tavakoli et al 2014 but since the intrusion of human waste into water resources causes various diseases and alters the taste and smell of water escherichia coli e coli level indicative of potential pathogen pollution and excrement content was considered a representative indicator of reservoir water quality coliform concentration was modeled as cole and wells 2006 1 c col d col t θ 20 φ col β col δ φ col δ z where c col is the rate of change in coliform concentration d col is the first order coliform concentration per diem decay rate at 20 c t is a temperature correction factor used to modify the decay rate d col usually 1 04 for coliform bacteria cole and wells 2006 θ is the water temperature c β col is settling velocity m day 1 φ col is the coliform concentration and z is the vertical coordinate two factors contribute to the elimination of coliforms decay and settling the first part of eq 1 d col t θ 20 φ col represents coliform first order decay and the second part β col δ φ col δ z represents the coliform settling factor cole and wells 2006 reservoir model calibration occurred in two stages i reservoir geometry calibration and ii reservoir operation calibration cole and wells 2006 given a lack of measured spatial and temporal distribution data for φ col the calibration process was more challenging however as this study focused on surrogate based optimization of the model rather than its calibration d col and β col were set to 0 73 day 1 and 1 38 m day 1 respectively auer and niehaus 1993 calibration of the ce qual w2 hydrodynamic simulation of iran s narmab dam reservoir drew on 2012 data including release values inflow stream temperature topography and meteorological information reservoir geometry was calibrated from geometric information used in developing a finite difference representation of the reservoir bathymetric cross sections were generated from a topographic map and a volume area elevation table was developed to serve as a basis of comparison for the model generated volume area elevation table calibration of the hydrodynamic features concentrated on temperature profiles and elevation of the water surface within the reservoir the hydrodynamic model was calibrated using daily water surface elevation wse and monthly vertical temperature profiles for 2012 fig 2 presents a comparison of measured wse and model simulated wse 2 2 mlp pca model based on its accurate performance in several water resources related studies adamowski et al 2012 parsaie and haghiabi 2015 taravatrooy et al 2018 an ann model with an mlp architecture was employed in the current study in a supervised training procedure this black box model was adjusted to minimize the error e between observed and estimated values araghinejad et al 2018 2 e j 1 j n o j e j 2 n where n is the number of data o j is the observed target value for the j th data point and e j is the estimated target value for the j th data point here inputs to the mlp neural network were reservoir outlets daily discharge values for all scenarios considered 1000 release scenarios for two outlets and 40 days 80 1000 and outputs were daily pollutant e coli concentrations for each input 80 pollutant concentrations per release scenario 80 1000 estimating the associated pollutant concentration for each injection location scenario involved forcing the ce qual w2 model with 1000 reservoir release scenarios this was repeated for three injection locations and eventually yielded four 80 1000 data matrices representing the mlp input output dataset one matrix included the 1000 different release modes and the other three the reservoir response pollutant concentration at reservoir outlets under the three different injection location scenarios computationally an mlp neural network model may be overfitted if it contains more parameters than can be calibrated by the input output dataset by removing redundant information from the dataset the application of pca can effectively reduce the number of nodes in the input and output layers thereby mitigating the overfitting issue in applying pca principal components of each standardized dataset are calculated and their individual contributions to the total variance quantified the principal components pcs can be specified as helena et al 2000 3 pc i a i 1 x 1 a i 2 x 2 a ip x p where ai are related eigenvectors p is the number of pcs and xi are related input variables in a second step rows contributing less than a preassigned threshold fraction of the total variation are eliminated for a case where the pca processing algorithm is fed two 80 1000 matrices one for reservoir release and another for released pollutant concentration at the reservoir outlets fig 3 shows the elimination of 72 and 78 principal components respectively thereby generating the input target dataset for the mlp model further details regarding the pca tool can be found in ilin and raiko 2010 on a pc equipped with an x64 based processor intel r core tm i7 6700k cpu 4 00 ghz 32 gb ram the ce qual w2 model s average run time for each release scenario was 65 s requiring 54 h to prepare the training data 3 1000 model runs the mlp pca model was implemented as a surrogate for the ce qual w2 model in the optimization procedure avoiding execution of the ce qual w2 simulation model with nsga ii the total surrogate based optimization run time was then about 10 100 s 2 8 h using the same pc system during which the surrogate model was run 151 200 times 2 3 nsga ii multi objective optimization model developed by deb et al 2002 and widely used in many fields of research e g nikoo et al 2014 alizadeh et al 2017 raei et al 2017 nsga ii is one of the most efficient and powerful multi objective optimization models in the present study a four objective nsga ii optimization model was used to identify a set of pareto optimal solutions four objective functions were formulated for the ministry of agriculture ma center for environmental health ceh ministry of energy me and regional water authority rwa as follows the objective function of minimizing non supplied water demand z ma was representative of the ma s preference to meet agricultural water demand 4 z ma m i n i m i z e t 1 t n t r t a d t 1 2 5 t r t r t 1 r t 2 where n is number of simulation days t is time in days a d t is the agricultural water demand for the t th day r t 1 r t 2 are the t th day s reservoir outlet releases for outlets 1 and 2 respectively and tr t is the total release from the dam on the t th day the objective function of minimizing the weighted combination of relative frequency and total magnitude of water quality standard violation z ceh was representative of the ceh s objective of adopting strategies that protect people s health from environmental hazards 6 z ceh m i n i m i z e w 1 n sv n frequency w 2 t 1 n sv m t c t c max n sv magnitude where w 1 and w 2 are weights assigned to the frequency and magnitude of pollution violation based on questionnaires completed by experts analyzed using the analytic hierarchy process ahp method saaty 1987 in the present study they were assigned values of w 1 0 5375 and w 2 0 4625 for further information about this process refer to supplementary material section s 2 c max is the maximum value of pollutant concentration at the reservoir outlets obtained by the ce qual w2 model in the second step of the proposed methodology it is considered to remain constant throughout the optimization process mt c t is the magnitude of the quality standard violation occurring at the reservoir outlets on the t th day of n sv and n sv is the number of days of water quality standard violation sewage and animal waste can contain several kinds of disease causing organisms that can lead to serious illnesses if consumed the appearance of e coli in water is a good indication of pollution of sewage or animal waste therefore in the case of sudden pollution injection into the reservoir based on the ceh s priorities it was preferable to minimize the quantity of hazardous material released from the dam outlets to ensure that the available water supply was safe and reliable the objective function of minimizing the difference between the rate of pollution e coli injection and pollutant release from reservoir outlets z me represented the preference of the me 7 z me m i n i m i z e t 1 t n 1 tp r t tip where tip is the total rate of the injected pollutant and tp r t is the total rate of pollutant e coli released from dam outlets on the t th day of simulation and is equal to c t out q t where c t out and q t are pollution concentration at the outlets and reservoir discharge on the t th day of simulation respectively in general the energy sector prefers to release more water from the reservoir to allow greater energy production however under conditions of sudden pollution injection it is not possible to release water indefinitely due to downstream qualitative requirements of the reservoir therefore the me preferred the rct to be minimized so that it could use the maximum capacity of the hydropower to generate hydroelectricity as soon as possible minimizing the rct variable was a straightforward objective function that could be defined to accomplish this however the trade off surface sensitivity analysis showed that by selecting rct as the independent variable of the objective function it was not possible to effectively include the consequences of different release scenarios on the objective function z me therefore considering the decision variables in this study reservoir outlets daily discharge values the idea of developing the objective function z me based on discharge values was proposed as an alternative strategy the objective function of minimizing the difference between the current reservoir storage and the normal water storage capacity z rwa represented the preference of the rwa 8 z rwa m i n i m i z e t 1 t n 1 s t s n where s n is the normal storage capacity of the reservoir which includes both inactive and active storage and refers to a volume of the reservoir below the normal water level nwl in the case study investigated here the nwl is 207 m above mean sea level which corresponds to a normal storage capacity of 115 million cubic meters madadi et al 2015 and s t is the present reservoir storage the rwa preferred to maintain the existing water storage of the reservoir for future supply in the nsga ii optimization model with 80 decision variables 40 day simulation for two reservoir outlets the population size and number of generations were set to 800 and 180 respectively 2 4 conflict resolution methods with multiple stakeholders the decision making process is often complicated by conflicting goals and different priorities in such situations the final decision should consider all stakeholders priorities disagreements and relative decision making power conflict resolution models exist to address these issues in the present study the widely used fb and scr conflict resolution models served to specify a compromise operational rule among all alternative rules non dominated solutions on the trade off curve fb was implemented with unanimity fb method and q approval fb method while the scrs were implemented with condorcet choice cc and borda scoring bs options finally mvr also an scr was used to select the best compromise solution among the four selected solutions provided by the aforementioned conflict resolution models fig 4 a brief description of each conflict resolution model follows 2 4 1 fallback bargaining fb method introduced by brams and kilgour 2001 the fb method begins with the bargainers most preferred alternative if they all agree the option is selected however if there are conflicts all stakeholders fall back to their next preferred alternative this process continues until the bargainers reach an alternative of adequate satisfaction sheikhmohammady and madani 2008 in other words the fb method maximizes the minimum satisfaction of bargainers two different approaches of the fb method were applied here unanimity fb and q approval fb unanimity fallback bargaining method based on the unanimity fb method the alternative of highest unanimous support and quality is chosen brams and kilgour 2001 sheikhmohammady and madani 2008 bargainers first rate all alternatives non dominated trade off solutions according to their priorities resulting in each bargainer selecting their most profitable choice a total of m alternatives ranked by n bargainers generates an n m matrix after rating alternatives and establishing a preferential matrix bargainers begin the negotiating process by choosing their most favored alternative and then drop back to their second third and so on before they all hit a point of acceptance the method maximizes the bargainers minimum satisfaction with the outcome of the unanimity being at least middling in each bargainers rating when all bargainers show an impasse in their ratings the impasse state may be chosen as the outcome brams and kilgour 2001 b q approval fallback bargaining method under the q approval fb method the alternative that q of n bargainers support where 1 q n is chosen brams and kilgour 2001 sheikhmohammady and madani 2008 2 4 2 social choice rules scrs arrow 1951 introduced the modern social choice theory which focuses on preferences when decision makers in fields such as political voting economy and managerial conflicts espouse different preferences amongst available alternatives applied to decision making a social choice rule scr chooses a set of feasible social states for each configuration of decision makers preferences and other characteristics fishburn 2015 some of the most common scr approaches to find a socially optimal solution include condorcet choice borda scoring and median voting rule briefly described below condorcet choice cc a condorcet winner is an alternative that is preferred over other alternatives by a majority of decision makers black et al 1958 this method reaches the preferable alternative by a two by two comparison between all possible choices with one point assigned to the preferred choice in each comparison step at the end the condorcet winner is the choice with the maximum number of points sheikhmohammady and madani 2008 borda scoring bs based on this method for n alternatives each decision maker assigns a score n j to his j th most preferred alternative in other words the score that an alternative receives is the number of times the alternative is preferred over others for each alternative scores assigned by each decision maker are summed then the alternative s with the highest total score is are selected as a borda compromise solution black et al 1958 median voting rule mvr mvr selects the alternative receiving the highest rank where the only important factor is the majority not the number of supporters bassett and persky 1999 3 case study a case study was conducted for the narmab dam which provides agricultural and domestic water along with hydroelectric demands to the cities of minoudasht gonbad and azadshahr in iran s golestan province fig 5 extending over a normal surface area of 5 4 km2 lat 36 45 02 37 13 40 n long 55 16 20 55 38 25 e the reservoir normally stores roughly 115 mcm of water madadi et al 2015 a plot of the reservoir s longitudinal segmentation adopted for the ce qual w2 model fig 6 i shows i where the narmab river s two branches the khormalou and chehel chay enter the reservoir yellow tipped arrows segments 15 and 9 respectively and ii the location of pollution injection sites red arrows distal 2 mid distance 9 and proximal 15 segments situated 6580 3290 and 470 m respectively from the dam outlets which received rectangular pulses of pollution e coli of 1 106 col dl 1 this level of pollutant entered the reservoir on the 91st julian day j day and continued for 5 days at a flow rate of 8 m3 s 1 fig 6 ii represents the ce qual w2 layers for the reservoir side view showing the 16 longitudinal segments and 23 layers the narmab dam has two outlets one at an elevation of 168 m and the other at 166 m above sea level and their locations are specified in fig 6 ii in case of a sudden pollution injection an immediate optimal reservoir operation response is critical to minimize damage this is achieved by addressing stakeholders disparate preferences and optimally meeting their collective demands the formulation of the objective function z me for example was developed on the basis that an operation policy should increase the pollutant release rate in order to increase the fraction of pollution that is eliminated by releasing water through the reservoir s outlets in such a case in addition to the reservoir s capacity for self purification the possibility of discharging the pollutant in water released through the reservoir s outlets has been considered to accelerate the cleaning of the reservoir likewise the objective function z ma specifically addressed the quantitative requirements water supply for water downstream from the reservoir without attention to any quality goals for these waters in fact the downstream quantitative and qualitative requirements of the reservoir were not assembled in one objective function but rather in two separate and contrasting objective functions objective functions z ma and z ceh 4 results to identify the optimal reservoir operation policy in case of a sudden pollution injection at each of the three specified injection locations fig 6 reservoir response sensitivity was evaluated using the ce qual w2 numerical model as expected reservoir responses to pollution injection in different segments varied significantly fig 7 given the fixed release values from the reservoir as mentioned earlier three important factors in the elimination of coliforms as a pollution indicator in the reservoir are decay settling and pollution release for a fixed release policy if pollution is injected into the reservoir at a location distant from the reservoir outlets the reservoir plays an important role in pollution washout and the pollutant has more time to decay and settle on the other hand the closer the pollutant injection is to the outlet of the reservoir the greater the first day maximum pollutant concentration at the reservoir outlets and the lower the rct the point of peak pollutant concentration for each injection segment indicates the role of the reservoir s shape in pollution washout for example injection at segment 15 proximal to the reservoir outlet resulted in a greater maximum concentration peak of pollution and lower rct than at the more distal locations in this case time to peak pollutant concentration and its values fig 7 illustrated that the more proximal the injection location the more the reservoir release strategy and operation played an important role compared to settling or decay factors 4 1 mlp pca results given the significantly different reservoir responses to pollution injection in different segments of the reservoir the release concentration relationship for each injection location was modeled by a distinct mlp pca model trained and validated with relevant data for example to train and validate the surrogate model for segment 2 two datasets release values and pollution concentrations for injection in segment 2 served as input and output data respectively see section 2 2 in establishing each mlp pca model the pca tool was first applied to the values of release scenarios and associated concentration levels at the outlets to reduce the dataset s dimensions and generate a smaller input output dataset appropriate for training the mlp model for each dataset after standardizing its data and calculating their variance covariance matrix its 80 principal components were obtained for each dataset the contribution of the first 20 principal components to the total variance is shown in fig 8 in this study the maximum fraction of removed rows was set to 0 018 for the inputs and 0 08 0 1 and 0 05 for the targets of injection sites 2 9 15 respectively achieved through a trial and error process the reduction of the dataset s dimensions through the deletion of its principal components had no significant effect on mlp model performance rows with a contribution to the total variation of less than the assigned maximum fractional value were removed for all pollution injection scenarios this process led to the elimination of 72 and 78 principal components of the input and target datasets respectively accordingly in all cases the size of input and output matrices were reduced to 8 1000 and 2 1000 respectively subsequently an mlp model was used to establish the relationship between the prepared input and target datasets for this purpose 70 and 30 of the pca processed dataset were randomly separated as training and validation sets respectively for the mlp model the best architecture for each single hidden layer mlp pca model table 1 was determined using a trial and error process to prevent the network from overfitting the training set and failing to generalize the invisible test dataset training ended when the error in the validation dataset began to increase this procedure was carried out by modifying the number of hidden layer neurons within a range of 5 30 statistical evaluations coefficient of determination and rmse of the mlp pca models training and validation phase accuracy for the three different injection sites are shown in table 1 since the output of the mlp pca model for each release scenario was an estimate based on the first two principal components of pollution concentration one must implement a reverse pca process on the values calculated by the mlp pca model as a last step for each release scenario the outcome of this step represented the temporal variation of the pollutant concentration at the two reservoir outlets 80 values of contaminant concentration based on the model accuracy evaluation criterion r2 temporal variations of the pollutant concentration computed by the proposed surrogate model compared well to values computed by the calibrated ce qual w2 model under all release scenarios a robust correlation for all release scenarios r2 0 93 existed between the time efficient mlp pca surrogate model s estimated pollutant concentrations and those of the ce qual w2 model fig 9 compares the results of release concentration modeling by the mlp pca and ce qual w2 models for a given scenario the surrogate models training process was significantly accelerated by replacing the mlp model which had 80 nodes in the input and output layers with the proposed mlp pca model for example the average training time of an mlp network with a 80 20 80 structure was 2760 s for each of the three injection location scenarios while these times were reduced to 26 s upon the pca based reduction of the input and output layer nodes to 8 and 2 4 2 optimization model results in the next step a four objective nsga ii optimization algorithm was developed and coupled with the relevant mlp pca surrogate model for each pollution injection location which in turn rendered four dimensional trade off surfaces consisting of 29 36 and 30 possible solutions for segments 2 9 and 15 respectively as mentioned before the optimization model s four objectives were related to the priorities of the different stakeholders in the case study the trade off surfaces associated with pollution injection sites at segments 2 and 15 are shown in fig 10 a and b respectively while for the pollution injection site at segment 9 the trade off surface is presented in fig s1 supplementary material in the trade off curves obtained for all three injection location scenarios it was clearly seen that the objective functions z ma and z me were in contradiction with the objective functions z ceh and z rwa this meant that the reduction of non supplied water demand and rct was in line with increasing the amount of pollution released from reservoir outlets and the difference between the current and normal reservoir storage 4 3 conflict resolution results four conflict resolution methods including bs cc unanimity fb and q approval fb were then employed to select the best compromise solution among the pareto optimal results illustrated in figs 10 and s1 table 2 shows the objective values of the selected compromise solutions achieved by each method for each pollution injection site results listed in table 2 show that while the selected compromise solutions by scrs bs and cc for each injection location scenario were the same the two fb methods q approval fb and unanimity fb derived two different compromise solutions also the comparison of the selected compromise solutions revealed that fb methods paid more attention to supplying water demand and reducing rct by selecting solutions that released more water the mvr conflict resolution model was then applied to achieve a solution with the maximum support of stakeholders between the four selected solutions listed in table 2 for the pollutant injection sites at segments 2 9 and 15 the superior solutions among the four conflict resolution methods selected by the median voting rule mvr were 1 14 and 16 respectively 4 4 analysis of solution behavior based on haddad et al 2013 we expected the trend of temporal variations in pollution concentration at reservoir outlets and the operation policy to be independent of one another i e regardless of the operation policy the pollution concentration at outlets would first increase and then decrease this is confirmed in fig 11 where pollutant concentrations calculated by the mlp pca model for both upper and lower outlets of the reservoir are shown for all three pollution injection scenarios and the two alternative reservoir management policies i no management policy i e pollution ignored and water released from reservoir as under normal conditions as determined by the official dam release rules ii policy selected by the mvr model indeed what lead to the difference in efficiency of the managed and unmanaged policies was their respective rates of pollutant release from the reservoir namely the product of pollution concentration at the outlets c out and reservoir discharge q i e c out q application of an operation policy selected by the mvr model as a compromise solution prompted an oscillating pattern in the rate of pollutant release whereas this pattern was almost uniform under unmanaged operation fig 12 a b and s2 the result of a constantly changing release policy fig 12c and d this oscillating pattern avoided introducing a fixed and beyond acceptable standards pollution rate to downstream waters in this way a large injection of pollutant would be followed by a small release from the dam such that downstream waters were not intermittently exposed to large pollution events the inequality of the area beneath the two curves fig 12a b and s2 was representative of the difference in the policies of releasing water from the reservoir outlets under both managed and unmanaged modes the proposed optimization model considering the four previously mentioned stakeholders objectives tried to reduce the risk of introducing pollution to downstream waters while at the same time meeting downstream water demands to the greatest possible extent accordingly this approach did not simultaneously use all outlets maximum capacity when the upper outlet was used to maximum capacity only part of the lower outlet s capacity was available indeed peaks of curves for injection sites in segments 2 and 15 did not occur at the same time pointing to the efficiency of the proposed optimization model to establish a compromise between stakeholders fig 12c and d for equivalent plots for pollutant injection at segment 9 see fig s3 the pollutant was eliminated from the reservoir sooner under injection at segment 15 than under other scenarios fig 11 in addition for segment 2 the peak duration of pollution concentration exceeded that under the other scenarios showing that the reservoir operator alert time to select the best operation strategy would be greater for segment 15 it would be less start and end times of pollution standard violation at the outlet of the reservoir and the rct resulting from each of the managed and unmanaged modes are presented for all three scenarios table 3 optimal release policy scenarios for pollutant injections in segments 2 9 and 15 led to decreases in rct of 2 2 and 1 days respectively the effect of release policy on pollution transfer within the reservoir and the effect of the reservoir on decreasing the cleaning time are illustrated in fig 13 for a pollutant injection in segment 2 and under the optimal release policy the reservoir returned to pre injection conditions in 112 julian days while under the unmanaged release the reservoir did not reach pre injection conditions until 5 days later 5 summary and conclusions assessing the performance of reservoirs and finding optimal strategies for reservoir operation in critical situations such as a sudden pollution injection requires one to balance the downstream demands of different sectors and maintain safe environmental conditions within both the dam reservoir and downstream waters in order to achieve these goals several tools were used in this study the ce qual w2 numerical model a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii multi objective optimization model a multilayer perceptron mlp neural network principal component analysis pca and several conflict resolution models this study proposed a novel and efficient method to implement a coupled mlp pca model with a nsga ii optimization model to consider four objectives the methodology involved first gathering reservoir data and employing the ce qual w2 numerical model numerous reservoir release and injection pollution scenarios were generated which in turn forced the ce qual w2 to determine reservoir cleanup time rct and associated pollution concentration for each scenario this procedure resulted in an input output dataset dimensions of which were reduced using a pca tool next an nsga ii multi objective optimization model was developed and coupled with the mlp pca model to achieve a set of pareto optimal solutions using four conflict resolution models condorcet choice borda scoring q approval and unanimity approaches different compromise solutions were achieved from which the best compromise solution was selected using a median voting rule mvr approach this conflict resolution procedure had not previously been applied to the optimal operation of a reservoir under a sudden pollution injection the application of an optimal release policy in the case of pollutant injections in reservoir segments 2 9 and 15 distal to proximal led to a decrease in rct of 2 2 and 1 days respectively a pollution injection location closer to rather than farther from the reservoir outlets led to a lower rct with the reservoir playing a lesser role in the elimination of pollution because of the smaller effects of decay and settling under these conditions injection location close to outlets the reservoir operator alert time to select the best operation strategy was lower hence the proposed methodology is an effective approach with a high efficiency for conflict resolution in sudden pollution injection conditions for a reservoir in this study we only investigated the impact of location of pollution injection on pollution concentration in reservoir outlets however other factors such as pollution intensity and time of pollution should be investigated the authors suggestions for future investigations include i consider more injection scenarios based on the amount location and time of pollution injection ii evaluate the risk to the system under conditions of sudden pollution injection iii consider the uncertainty of meteorological and hydrological factors caused by different times of pollution injection iv consider the effect of surrogate model error on the optimization model and the optimal solution and v investigate the possibility of real time reservoir operation under suddenly injected pollution by integrating

4516,understanding the interactions between surface water and groundwater is of considerable significance for managing water resources and protecting ecosystems in arid and semi arid areas this study investigated the hydrochemistry stable isotopes d 18o and radioisotopes 222rn to identify the interactions between surface water and groundwater in delingha a typical arid area in northwest china in this area the surface water mainly consists of the bayin river which flows from the north mountainous area to the southwest terminal lake areas hurleg and tuosu lakes and the groundwater also generally flows from north to southwest and is characterized by a single layered sandy and gravelly aquifer in the alluvial proluvial plain and multi layered aquifers in the alluvial lacustrine plain the stable isotopes reveal that the water bodies in the plain are mainly recharged by precipitation in the mountainous area the hydrochemistry and isotopes results tds d 18o and 222rn combined with the groundwater level indicate that the surface water and groundwater interactions exhibit spatial variability it was found that the bayin river generally infiltrates into aquifer in the alluvial proluvial plain and repeatedly interchanges with groundwater in the alluvial lacustrine plain the flux rate of groundwater discharge in the alluvial lacustrine plain is estimated to be 0 55 2 49 10 4 m3 s m by the 222rn mass balance model showing a decreasing tendency along the flow path in addition the flux rate of river leakage occurring in the upper and middle areas of the alluvial lacustrine plain is estimated to be 1 65 3 19 10 4 m3 s m these findings provide a hydrological conceptual model and valuable flux data of water interchange for water resource management keywords 222rn water interaction recharge discharge processes spatial variability delingha 1 introduction in arid and semi arid areas groundwater is the primary water resource for life industry and agriculture and is vital for the protection of vulnerable ecosystems yang et al 2018 in this regard surface water bodies such as rivers and lakes are of considerable importance in the recharge and discharge of groundwater in regional aquifer systems understanding and quantitatively estimating the interactions between surface water and groundwater can allow the sustainable development of water utilization and eco environmental protection cartwright and hofmann 2015 chapman et al 2007 liao et al 2018 su et al 2015 yang et al 2020 for example estimation results of the interchange flux rate between surface water and groundwater can provide data to avoid the double counting of integrated water resources in quantity assessments and can support collaborative water management peranginangin et al 2004 singh 2014 in addition studying the interactions between surface water and groundwater is also necessary for better management of water quantity and quality because the development or pollution of groundwater or surface water can influence each other cook 2013 khan and khan 2019 winter 1999 zhu et al 2019 to effectively assess the interactions between surface water and groundwater several methods have been developed including those that use flow gauging cartwright et al 2013 harte and kiah 2009 mccallum et al 2012 electrical conductivity gilfedder et al 2015 lucía et al 2019 heat tracers anibas et al 2009 rau et al 2010 2017 numerical modeling kurylyk et al 2014 tian et al 2015 yang et al 2017 hydrochemistry cartwright et al 2011 cartwright and gilfedder 2015 kong et al 2019 stable isotopes such as δ2h and δ18o of water δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 of sulfate ratio of 87sr 86sr brenot et al 2015 wen et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 and radioactive isotopes cook et al 2008 gilfedder et al 2015 su et al 2015 yang et al 2020 among these methods hydrochemical parameters and isotopic tracers are relatively suitable for identifying and quantifying the spatial and temporal patterns of surface water and groundwater interactions on a regional scale gil márquez et al 2019 lucía et al 2019 xie et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 it has been proven that a variety of chemical and isotopic tracers can be used to study the interaction between groundwater and surface water for example the 2h i e d and 18o isotopes of water are useful natural tracers for qualitatively identifying water sources and quantitatively assessing groundwater inflows into surface water kong et al 2019 wen et al 2018 the analysis of the variation of hydrochemical parameters such as electrical conductivity and major ions particularly cl na and mg2 between surface water and groundwater can also effectively determine groundwater discharge into rivers cartwright et al 2011 gilfedder et al 2015 stellato et al 2008 chlorofluorocarbons cfcs have also been indicated as useful to quantitatively estimate the exchange flux of river and groundwater because cfcs have a significantly lower concentration in old groundwater compared to river water cook et al 2003 sulfur hexafluoride sf6 can also be used as a factor to indicate the river groundwater interaction cook et al 2006 anthropogenic gadolinium gd in the surface water as well as in adjacent groundwater can be analyzed to trace the mixing of surface water with groundwater boester and rüde 2020 strontium isotopes can also be used as tracers for groundwater surface water interactions frei et al 2020 in addition some radionuclides are also useful for studying the interaction between groundwater and surface water for example the u series such as 234u 238u ratio of river water has been used to calculate the flow contribution from deep and shallow aquifers navarro martinez et al 2017 schaffhauser et al 2014 radium ra which has a positive correlation with salinity is a useful tracer for determining the interaction between fresh groundwater and saline surface water moore 1996 2007 radon 222rn which is produced by the radioactive decay of 226ra and features a short half life of 3 83 days can diffuse into groundwater and reach a dynamic secular equilibrium between production and decay after approximately five half lives cecil and green 2000 cartwright and gilfedder 2015 the concentration of 222rn in surface water is considerably lower than that in groundwater due to radioactive decay and atmosphere evasion when 222rn rich groundwater flows into surface water the concentration of 222rn in surface water significantly increases cook et al 2008 ellins et al 1990 su et al 2015 yang et al 2020 thus 222rn is an excellent tracer for quantifying the water interchange flux between surface water and groundwater cartwright et al 2011 liao et al 2018 lucía et al 2019 stellato et al 2008 wu et al 2004 zhao et al 2018 delingha located in the northeast of the qaidam basin is a typical arid area and an important economic development zone of the silk road economic belt which is an infrastructure program to stimulate economic integration across the eurasian continent issues regarding water resources in the qaidam basin have attracted considerable attention because of scarce precipitation and intense evaporation qin 1999 sheng et al 2018 su et al 2015 xu et al 2017 yang et al 2018 yang and wang 2020 zhao et al 2018 for example zhang et al 2020 investigated groundwater evolution using hydrochemical methods liu et al 2014 showed that in the past 40 years the area of hurleg lake has remained unchanged whereas that of tuosu lake has considerably changed wen et al 2018 qualitatively analyzed the interaction between bayin river water and groundwater however they did not quantitatively estimate the water interaction flux along the flow direction and its spatial variability as it is important to estimate the water interaction flux in water resource management and eco environment protection it is meaningful to conduct an in depth study of the surface water and groundwater interaction in delingha in addition increasing precipitation has occurred in this region annual average precipitation from 1956 to 2013 is shown in fig s1 which has increased the surface runoff and groundwater level and has led to serious farmland inundation soil salinization and house collapses liu et al 2014 wen et al 2018 zhao and chen 2014 given this background it is urgent to understand and quantitatively estimate the interactions between groundwater and surface in this region in this study the hydrochemical parameters and isotopes d 18o and 222rn were used to reveal the water recharge source and identify the surface water and groundwater interactions along the flow path by using the 222rn mass balance model hereinafter referred to as 222rn mbm the exchange flux between groundwater and river water was quantitatively estimated this in depth evaluation of surface water and groundwater interaction in this study area will provide useful guidance for understanding the processes of the hydrologic cycle and for supporting water resource management 2 description of the study area the delingha study area is located in the northeast of the qaidam basin and surrounded by zongwulong mountain buhete mountain delingha uplift and denan hills in the north east west and south respectively fig 1 a the landform of this study area is characterized by a mountain alluvial proluvial plain and alluvial lacustrine plain from north to south fig 1a the delingha area has a typical plateau continental climate with an annual average temperature of 3 9 c the annual average precipitation is 169 3 mm yr approximately 85 of which occurs from may to september whereas the annual average evaporation reaches 2036 3 mm yr zhang et al 2020 the precipitation significantly increases with the terrain elevation and exceeds 450 mm yr in the zongwulong mountain as shown in fig 1a in the study area there are three rivers baishui bayin and lianshui rivers and three lakes hurleg tuosu and gahai lakes the 188 km long bayin river which is the dominant surface water body in this study area originates mainly from the zongwulong mountain with a catchment area of 7281 km2 and flows from east to west in areas between the zongwulong and buhete mountains when it merges at heishishan reservoir with the baishui river which is a 16 km long stream fed by springs in the south of zongwulong mountain and flows from north to south the bayin river starts to flow southward along the river flow path the bayin river generally leaks into the subsurface in the middle of the alluvial proluvial plain and reappears in the form of springs in the forefront of the alluvial proluvial plain when it flows towards the denan hills the bayin river starts to flow westward in the lower reaches due to denan hills and flows through the alluvial lacustrine plain finally discharging into hurleg lake located in the southwest of study area the hurleg lake water flows through the lianshui river into the tuosu lake a terminal lake located in the south of hurleg lake hurleg lake is characterized by freshwater with total dissolved solids tds 1 g l whereas the water in tuosu lake is salty gahai lake is another terminal salty lake located in the southeast of the study area with no hydraulic connectivity with the bayin river the midstream and downstream areas areas between heishishan reservoir and tuosu lake are the main study areas corresponding to alluvial proluvial plain and alluvial lacustrine plain respectively there are no evident tributaries during the two sampling periods november 2016 and march 2019 generally the relationship between the monthly average flow rate of the bayin river and precipitation indicates that the changes in monthly precipitation and river flow rates are consistent fig s2 rainfall or river flux increases from may to august and then declines until october in the delingha area the pre quaternary strata comprise sinian carboniferous dias triassic jurassic cretaceous and neogene strata zhang et al 2020 the dias and triassic strata with joints and fissures provide storage space for bedrock fissure water and the fracture karst is distributed in carboniferous strata these three strata are mainly distributed in the northern mountainous area limestone and shale are dominant in the carboniferous strata while the dias and triassic strata are composed of sandstone limestone and slate groundwater generally occurs in the porous media of quaternary unconsolidated sediments which are distributed throughout the plain area fig 1b at the apex and middle of the alluvial proluvial plain the single layered alluvial aquifer features a thickness exceeding 300 m and a large water table depth 80 120 m in the apex area and 10 30 m in the middle area and is composed of sand and gravel the aquifer system transforms from a single layered to multi layered structure with fine grained sediment and low water table depth 10 m in the distal part of the alluvial proluvial plain wen et al 2018 in the alluvial lacustrine plain distributed in the lower reaches of bayin river aquifer system are multi layered aquifers characterized by the interbedding of clay and fine sand zhang et al 2020 in this study region the groundwater initially flows from north to south and then turns to the west at the forefront of the alluvial proluvial plain owing to denan hills in the denan hills precipitation is rare and groundwater is difficult to form in the western part of the alluvial proluvial plain the groundwater flows from north to south and then to the southeast due to the delingha uplift but finally flows westward in the eastern part of the alluvial proluvial plain a small amount of groundwater flows southeast along the ancient river channel and merges into gahai lake fig 1a 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analysis in this study two field samplings were performed in november 2016 and march 2019 fourteen water samples 13 phreatic groundwater samples and 1 lake water sample were collected in the first period november 2016 for major ion and stable isotope d and 18o analysis table s1 based on the first field work 38 samples 6 confined groundwater samples 6 phreatic groundwater samples 2 spring samples 13 river water samples and 11 lake water samples were collected along the bayin river in march 2019 the major ions and stable isotopes d and 18o of the 38 water samples were analyzed in addition to the 222rn concentrations of 30 water samples which are a subset of the 38 samples in addition 10 precipitation rain and snow samples were also collected at the delingha seismic station thus a total of 62 samples were sampled during these two sampling periods table s1 the rain and snow melted indoors were funneled into 100 ml brown polyethylene bottles and sealed groundwater was sampled from wells springs and boreholes before groundwater sampling the groundwater in wells or boreholes was pumped out until the field hydrochemistry parameters were relatively stable to eliminate the impact of stagnant water the spring and artesian water samples were directly collected by a plastic tube the river waters collected from bayin and lianshui rivers and the lake waters collected from hurleg and tuosu lakes were collected near the shores using a hand held pump connected to a plastic tube during sampling one end of the tube was inserted 20 cm below the lake surface and close to the lake bottom and the other end was inserted into the bottom of the sampling bottle and slowly removed after water overflow all the water samples were filtered through membranes and stored in a polyethylene bottle which was rinsed 3 4 times using sampled water the water samples collected for anions and stable isotope d and 18o analyses were stored separately in 60 ml and 30 ml polyethylene bottles respectively and separate 60 ml water samples for cation analysis were acidified to ph 2 with concentrated nitric acid all bottles were sealed with wax to ensure a watertight seal the ph tds and temperature t were measured in the field using a portable parameter instrument the main cations k na ca2 and mg2 were tested by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes the main anions cl and so4 2 were analyzed by ion chromatography ics 2100 and the co3 2 and hco3 were analyzed by acid base titration the stable isotopes of water samples were tested by isotope ratio mass spectrometry and the results were expressed in the usual δ units calculated with respect to standard sample δsample r sample r standard 1 1000 where r sample and r standard represent the ratio of heavy to light isotopes of the sample and standard respectively a rad 7 detector durridge company inc was used to detect radon concentrations 222rn via α decay accounts 222rn concentrations in groundwater and surface water were measured differently a 250 ml sample of groundwater was carefully collected with a glass vial for detecting 222rn concentrations by a rad h2o system luo et al 2016 the groundwater in the vials was aerated for 5 min using the internal pump of rad 7 and the extracted radon gas was delivered to the rad 7 through a small drying tube the rad 7 performed counting for four 5 min periods after a stabilization period of 5 min unlike groundwater 2 5 l of surface water was collected into a glass jug for 222rn analysis using the big bottle system luo et al 2018 the surface water was aerated for 15 min the radon was moved from water into the rad 7 through a laboratory drying unit and the rad 7 instrument collected 11 readings over 5 min periods after a stabilization period of 15 min after testing a sample the rad 7 needed to be purged with dry air for 10 20 min to maintain its dryness and to eliminate the impact of one test on the next sample all relevant data are provided in the supplementary document table s1 3 2 222rn mass balance model to estimate the exchange flux between river water and groundwater we used the 222rn mbm established by su et al 2015 the radon mass balance between the upper and lower reaches of the river is expressed by the equation su et al 2015 1 q d c d q u c u δ m where q u and q d represent upstream and downstream river discharge m3 s respectively c u and c d are the 222rn concentrations of upstream and downstream stream water bq m3 respectively δ m is the 222rn variation between two river sampling sites which is attributed to the recharge from groundwater discharge river leakage radioactive decay atmospheric evasion inflow and outflow of tributaries and 226ra decay of riverine sediments because of the complex river groundwater interaction some assumptions needed to be considered as follow in this study area there are no impacts of local pumps and tributaries and the groundwater and river are the only recharge sources the impacts of precipitation and evaporation are negligible because the sampling work was performed in the dry season with less precipitation and the short runoff path between two sampling points leads to very low evaporation the river water has an evenly distributed 222rn concentration both in the horizontal and vertical directions cook 2013 yang et al 2020 222rn produced by 226ra decay in river water and riverbed sediments is insignificant wu et al 2004 hyporheic exchange is also not considered su et al 2015 the 222rn concentration due to radioactive decay and gas exchange in this model can be calculated by the following equations 2 c d c u exp α l 3 α β γ where α is the total loss coefficient radioactive decay and gas exchange ellins et al 1990 m 1 l is the distance between upstream and downstream river sampling points m and β is the 222rn radioactive decay coefficient corrected by the average river velocity of the upstream and downstream sections m 1 γ is the degassing loss coefficient m 1 radon loss caused by atmospheric evasion is described by the surface renewal theory which indicates that gas exchange is mainly due to turbulence danckwerts 1951 o connor and dobbins 1958 the 222rn radioactive decay coefficient and degassing loss coefficient can be described by peng et al 1974 ellins et al 1990 stellato et al 2008 4 β λ v 5 γ d 0 5 v 0 5 h 1 5 where λ is the radon radioactive decay constant 2 08 10 6 s 1 v and h are the average velocity m s and average river depth m of the river reach respectively and d is the 222rn molecular diffusion coefficient cm2 s which is a function of the absolute temperature t logd 980 t 1 59 due to the frequent conversion between river water and groundwater there are three river groundwater interaction situations fig s3 the mass conservation equations describing these three river groundwater interaction situations are expressed as follows su et al 2015 6 q d c d q u c u e a l

c d q u q d o r c u c d q u q d c where q g and q r are the groundwater discharge and river leakage per unit length m3 s m respectively and cg is the 222rn concentration of groundwater bq m3 for eq 6a the 222rn concentration and river discharge at the upstream sampling site are both lower than those at the downstream sampling site indicating the occurrence of groundwater discharge into the river for eq 6b the 222rn concentration and river discharge at the upstream sampling site are both higher than those at the downstream sampling site indicating the occurrence of river leakage for eq 6c the 222rn concentration and river discharge differences between the upstream and downstream sampling sites are opposite indicating the coexistence of river leakage and groundwater discharge assuming that they are evenly distributed along the river reaches then the analytic solutions eqs 7a 7b and 7c of eqs 6a 6b and 6c respectively are given as follows su et al 2015 7 q g c d q d c u e α l q u c g α 1

the river and is expressed as harte and kiah 2009 lerner et al 1990 mccallum et al 2012 8 δ q q d q u q g l q d q u δ q q d q u q r l q d q u where δq is the net exchange flux of river groundwater interaction along the river reaches which is used to determine the hydraulic transformation direction of river water and groundwater the river flow balance flow balance model abbreviated to fbm can be used as a reference for the 222rn mbm to obtain a more realistic calculation result 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical characteristics the results of the physicochemical parameters of groundwater and surface water are given in table 1 and table s1 the ph values of all the water samples ranged from 7 1 to 8 9 indicating that river water lake water and groundwater are neutral to slightly alkaline the ph values of groundwater and hurleg lake water 7 2 8 2 and 7 1 8 2 respectively are relatively lower than those of river water 7 6 8 7 and the ph values of tuosu lake water are the highest 8 2 8 9 the temperatures of surface water 0 3 10 1 c are generally lower than those of groundwater 7 1 11 3 c the temperature of the bayin river increases from low 0 3 4 0 c in the midstream reaches to high 2 0 10 1 c in the downstream reaches indicating groundwater discharge into the river at the downstream reaches in addition hurleg and tuosu lakes are characterized by low temperatures compared with the hurleg lake water temperature in other areas the lake water temperature 2 9 6 7 c is higher at the east side of the lake where it is directly fed by the bayin river and groundwater in conclusion the temperature of water can reveal the occurrence of hydraulic interactions between groundwater and downstream bayin river and hurleg lake the tds of river water and phreatic groundwater are 373 1 2766 0 mg l and 322 0 8954 0 mg l respectively showing an increasing tendency along the flow path fig 2 in contrast the tds content of confined groundwater which mainly occurs in the alluvial lacustrine plain fig 1 is relatively low and varies between 345 2 and 626 5 mg l implying that the interaction between phreatic groundwater and confined groundwater is relatively weak as shown in table s1 hurleg lake water is characterized by a low tds of 183 6 923 7 mg l generally fresh water like most groundwater and river samples however the lianshui river which receives inflow from hurleg lake showed high tds values of 2155 0 2766 0 mg l followed by those of tuosu lake fed by lianshui river 3859 0 7735 0 mg l which probably indicates evaporation and less recharge from groundwater from the piper plot fig 3 piper 1944 it can be seen that the hydrochemistry type of precipitation is so4 hco3 na ca the hydrochemistry of the bayin river changes from hco3 cl ca mg to cl hco3 so4 na ca mg along the flow path considering the groundwater from the alluvial proluvial plain to alluvial lacustrine plain group 1 to group 2 in fig 3 the major anions of phreatic water change from hco3 cl or hco3 so4 to so4 cl and cl so4 and the major cations change from ca na to na mg as shown in fig 3 the hydrochemistry types of phreatic groundwater and river water are generally similar revealing the relatively close interaction between phreatic groundwater and bayin river however the hydrochemistry type of confined groundwater is relatively simple hco3 cl ca na or hco3 so4 ca na the hydrochemistry types of hurleg lake water are hco3 cl na cl so4 na mg and cl na mg and that of the tuosu lake a terminal lake is cl so4 na mg similar to the difference in tds the difference in hydrochemistry types also implies that the recharge discharge processes of the two lakes are different 4 2 stable isotopic characteristics stable isotopes of hydrogen d and oxygen 18o represent a helpful tool for indicating hydrological process information such as recharge sources evaporation and mixing processes el sayed et al 2018 yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 the stable isotope compositions of precipitation surface water and groundwater are listed in table 1 and fig 4 the full dataset in table s1 all the surface water and groundwater samples are close to the global meteoric water line gmwl δd 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 suggesting that the water in this study area is recharged by meteoric precipitation for this study area the local meteoric water line lmwl in the plain is δd 8 47δ18o 15 2 tian et al 2001 the local evaporation line lel is δd 5 12δ18o 12 88 r2 0 98 with the slope and intercept being smaller than those of the lmwl related to the arid climate characteristics of this study area rain and snow samples were collected in the north of the plain area middle area between r1 and r2 i e area marked by the red star in fig 1a as shown in table 1 the average values of δd and δ18o for snowfall are 78 40 and 11 50 respectively however the isotope data of rainfall collected in summer are more enriched with average values of 13 27 and 2 12 for δd and δ18o respectively the stable isotopes of river water and groundwater are from 67 35 to 45 12 for δd and from 10 41 to 6 09 for δ18o which are more depleted than those of rainfall but more enriched than those of snowfall however most surface water and groundwater samples are mainly located to the left of the lmwl fig 4a implying that little precipitation in the plain area recharges groundwater and surface water in addition according to previous studies of local moisture recycling froehlich et al 2008 kong and pang 2016 the water vapor generated by evaporation can be transported to the mountainous area and then condenses into precipitation which is characterized by high d excess and is located to the left of the lmwl in the plain area furthermore as shown in fig s2 the time series curve of the bayin river flow rate is similar to that of precipitation indicating that the dynamic of river flow rate is mainly controlled by precipitation dynamic thus we can conclude that the precipitation in mountain area is the main recharge source of local water which is consistent with the results of a previous study wen et al 2018 the isotopic ratios of bayin river samples vary from 61 98 to 56 04 for δd and from 9 50 to 8 55 for δ18o with average values of 58 82 and 9 05 respectively from fig 4b it can be seen that the bayin river samples are located in the same area as the phreatic groundwater however compared with the bayin river samples the lianshui river and lake samples mainly featured enriched isotopic signatures moreover it can also be seen that the stable isotope concentrations of tuosu lake δd 35 02 to 8 39 δ18o 3 95 to 3 45 are higher than those of hurleg lake δd 56 14 to 39 20 δ18o 8 64 to 5 59 the isotopic ratios of hurleg lake are generally closer to those of phreatic water and bayin river water the isotopic values δd 56 03 to 45 12 δ18o 8 06 to 6 09 of lianshui river fig 1 connecting the two lakes tuosu and hurleg lakes are slightly lower than those of hurleg lake δd and δ18o of phreatic groundwater change from 64 60 to 55 11 and 10 20 to 8 65 with averages of 59 48 and 9 22 respectively table 1 the linear regression line of phreatic groundwater is δd 5 84δ18o 5 59 r2 0 60 with the slope and intercept smaller than those of the gmwl indicating that the phreatic groundwater underwent evaporation however δd and δ18o of confined groundwater ranges from 67 35 to 60 27 and 10 41 to 9 39 with average values of 65 20 and 10 08 respectively which are slightly depleted compared to those of phreatic groundwater table 1 in addition the confined water samples are located at the lower left of phreatic water implying that the confined groundwater was not subjected to evaporation 4 3 spatial distribution characteristics of water interactions 4 3 1 indications from stable isotopes along the flow path of the bayin river variations in stable isotopes of groundwater and river water were analyzed to identify the spatial distribution characteristics of water interactions as shown in fig 5 the close stable isotopic compositions of the bayin river water and phreatic groundwater indicate the frequent hydraulic connections between them δd and δ18o of the bayin river show an evident fluctuation in the midstream reaches 0 30 km and are stable δd 59 18 to 56 40 δ18o 9 27 to 8 55 in the downstream reaches 30 55 km however the stable isotopes of groundwater are enriched first and then depleted from 59 84 to 55 11 to 63 65 for δd and from 9 08 to 8 65 to 9 65 for δ18o reflecting the effects of evaporation on groundwater in the distal parts of the alluvial proluvial plain with water depths 10 m p3 and p4 areas in fig 1b the most depleted δd and δ18o values of groundwater occur at location of about 40 km where the hydrogeological structure changes from single layered to multi layered aquifer which indicates the weakest evaporation effect in this area in addition in the alluvial proluvial plain 30 km the stable isotopic ratios of river water r2 r3 r4 and r5 are close to those of groundwater p1 p2 p3 and p4 but clearly decrease at 25 km indicating that the river groundwater interaction changes from receiving river leakage to groundwater discharge into the river at 25 km however in the downstream reaches 30 km the isotopic values of groundwater p9 and p14 are relatively similar to those of river water r7 and r8 and the isotopic values of groundwater show an increasing tendency along the flow path from 63 65 to 59 20 and 9 65 to 9 30 for δd and δ18o respectively implying the occurrence of river leakage the variation in stable isotopes of the terminal lakes hurleg and tuosu lakes and lianshui river are shown in fig 5 as shown the isotopic ratios of hurleg lake are closer to the phreatic water and bayin river water which indicates that the hurleg lake is directly recharged by the bayin river and phreatic groundwater the stable isotopes of the lianshui river r12 with 56 03 δd and 8 06 δ18o are significantly smaller than those of hurleg lake hl with 49 85 δd and 7 28 δ18o indicating that the lianshui river is also recharged by local groundwater with depleted isotopes by comparison it was found that the stable isotopes of tuosu lake tl 23 71 δd and 2 01 δ18o are more enriched than those of lianshui river and hurleg lake implying that the tuosu lake is constantly undergoing evaporation 4 3 2 indications from 222rn to further identify the interactions between groundwater and surface water the 222rn concentrations of groundwater river and lake water were analyzed in this section fig 6 and table 2 the 222rn concentrations of groundwater 6166 05 29848 65 bq m3 are 1 3 orders of magnitude larger than those of river water 63 00 1722 41 bq m3 along the flow path of the bayin river the 222rn concentration of river water changes showing a tendency of first increasing from 106 40 bq m3 sample site r2 to 1722 41 bq m3 sample site r6 and then decreasing to 365 72 bq m3 sample site r10 however as shown in fig 6 and table 2 the 222rn concentration of groundwater decreased first from 29848 65 to 8768 53 bq m3 and then increased to 18919 91 bq m3 at the apex and middle of the alluvial proluvial plain 20 km after flowing out of the heishishan reservoir the 222rn concentration of bayin river water r2 r3 and r4 with an average value of 81 70 bq m3 shows a slightly decrease from 106 40 to 63 00 bq m3 owing to radioactive decay and gas exchange wu et al 2004 zhao et al 2018 however the 222rn concentrations of groundwater p1 p2 and p3 significantly decreased from 29848 65 to 8768 53 bq m3 implying that the groundwater at the apex and middle of the alluvial proluvial plain 20 km fig 6 is recharged from bayin river leakage in addition the groundwater flow field fig 7 which shows a groundwater level less than the river stage is another evidence of river leakage into groundwater in this area at the front edge of the alluvial proluvial plain and the upper part of the alluvial lacustrine plain approximately 20 45 km the 222rn concentration of groundwater gradually increases from 8768 53 to 18919 91 bq m3 p3 to p4 and p21 fig 6 and table 2 it should be noted that the 222rn concentration of spring p7 6166 05 bq m3 is minimal due to gas exchange and radioactive decay after overflowing the surface the bayin river also has a high 222rn concentration of approximately 805 95 1722 41 bq m3 r5 r6 and r7 fig 6 suggesting that the bayin river is recharged by groundwater in this river reach moreover as shown in fig 7 the local higher groundwater level than the river stage also demonstrates the occurrence of local groundwater discharge into the bayin river in the distal and middle parts of the alluvial lacustrine plain further than 45 km the 222rn concentration of river water decreases from 653 58 bq m3 r8 to 365 72 bq m3 r10 with increasing distance possibly indicating a decrease in groundwater discharge into the river in this area as the terminal end of this regional water flow system hurleg lake has a relatively low 222rn concentration from 7 63 to 362 81 bq m3 with an average value of 112 65 bq m3 which is generally related to radioactive decay and atmospheric escape in addition as shown in fig 6 the spatial distribution of 222rn concentrations in the hurleg lake area shows that the highest 222rn concentration 362 81 bq m3 is adjacent to the bayin river indicating river discharge into hurleg lake then after the hurleg lake water flows into the lianshui river the 222rn concentration again shows a significant increasing tendency and reaches a maximum value of 617 75 bq m3 r12 possibly indicating local groundwater discharge into the lianshui river which is consistent with the results of stable isotopic analysis finally when the lianshui river flows into tuosu lake the 222rn concentrations 18 03 35 04 bq m3 are low again with an average value of 26 50 bq m3 owing to atmospheric escape and radioactive decay in summary according to the characteristics of d and 18o stable isotopes and 222rn on the one hand the groundwater receives river leakage at the apex and middle of alluvial proluvial plain and discharges into the bayin river at the front edge of alluvial proluvial plain and the upper alluvial lacustrine plain then has decreasing groundwater discharge in the distal and middle parts of the alluvial lacustrine plain on the other hand hurleg lake mainly recharges from the bayin river and groundwater on the east side and discharges into the lianshui river which receives not only hurleg lake water but also groundwater and finally feeds the tuosu lake 4 4 quantificational estimation of water interactions using 222rn mbm as analyzed in the above sections the hydrochemical and isotopic results reveal the spatial distribution characteristics of interactions between groundwater and surface water along the flow direction to further estimate the exchange flux between groundwater and river in the downstream reaches of bayin river the area between sampling sites r5 and r10 where the groundwater discharge occurs the 222rn mbm and the fbm were applied in the calculation with those models the parameter d 222rn molecular diffusion coefficient was calculated based on the temperature of river water cg was the average 222rn concentration of groundwater samples p4 and p21 cg 17097 75 bq m3 and the sectional flow flux q u and q d was calculated using the monitored average flow velocity and sectional area of the sampling sites r5 r6 r7 r8 and r10 the calculation results are displayed in table 3a and 3b a schematic representation is provided to show the groundwater surface water interaction fig 8 as shown in table 3a in the river reach of r5 r6 the 222rn concentration as well as the river discharge at the upstream sampling site r5 is lower than that at the downstream sampling site r6 thus eq 6a was chosen to calculate the groundwater discharge into this river reach the groundwater discharge calculated by the fbm and 222rn mbm were 0 60 10 4 m3 s m and 2 13 10 4 m3 s m respectively this latter discharge flux is considerably larger than the former in addition as shown in fig 7 the groundwater level is higher than the river stage in some parts and lower in others indicating the coexistence of groundwater discharge and river leakage in this river reach from r5 to r6 thus q g and q r need to be recalculated using eq 6c the recalculated results of q g and q r are 2 25 10 4 m3 s m and 1 65 10 4 m3 s m respectively the result of net groundwater discharge q g q r 2 25 1 65 10 4 0 60 10 4 m3 s m is consistent with the result of fbm 0 60 10 4 m3 s m table 3a in the river reach of r6 r7 the different variation patterns of river discharge and 222rn concentration between upstream and downstream suggest that eq 6c should be used to calculate the river leakage and groundwater discharge the results show that the estimated river leakage is negative which indicates the inexistence of river leakage in this river reach in addition the groundwater discharge 2 49 10 4 m3 s m was estimated by 222rn mbm in the river reach of r7 r8 the river discharge and 222rn concentration downstream are both less than those upstream implying the occurrence of river leakage however the result of river leakage calculated by eq 6b is negative and the 222rn concentration downstream r8 is lightly high 653 58 bq m3 indicating the coexistence of river leakage and groundwater discharge within this river reach thus eq 6c should be used to recalculate q r and q g which are 3 19 10 4 m3 s m and 0 56 10 4 m3 s m respectively this relatively larger flux rate of river leakage implies that river leakage into groundwater is the major hydrological process in this river reach of r7 r8 for the river reach of r8 r10 like r6 r7 eq 6c was used according to the variations of 222rn concentration and river flow rate from upstream to downstream the groundwater discharge 0 55 10 4 m3 s m was estimated by the 222rn mbm in conclusion the interaction between surface water and groundwater in delingha was determined using hydrochemical and isotopic analyses in this study as shown in the conceptual diagram of water interaction between surface water and phreatic aquifer fig 8 bayin river water mainly infiltrates the phreatic aquifer at the apex and middle parts of the alluvial proluvial plain where there is a considerable water table depth areas between sampling sites r1 and r5 in the areas of the distal part of the alluvial proluvial plain and the upper part of the alluvial lacustrine plain areas between sampling sites r5 and r7 as the water table increases groundwater generally discharges into the bayin river with estimated discharge rates of 2 25 2 49 10 4 m3 s m table 3b however due to the heterogeneity of the groundwater level distribution fig 7 part of the groundwater receives river leakage in areas between sampling sites r5 and r6 with an estimated leakage value of 1 65 10 4 m3 s m table 3b then in the middle part of the alluvial lacustrine plain areas between sampling sites r7 and r10 less groundwater discharges into the bayin river with flux rates of 0 55 0 56 10 4 m3 s m table 3b and river water leakage occurs in some areas between sampling sites r7 and r8 with a high leakage rate of 3 19 10 4 m3 s m table 3b in general our results have revealed the spatial variability of the interaction between surface water and groundwater which contributes to the local hydrologic processes in addition the estimated results of bayin river leakage and groundwater discharge are key water budget data for reasonable water resource assessment furthermore the runoff in bayin river which is one of the important recharge sources of local groundwater zhou 2016 has increased in recent years liu et al 2014 wen et al 2018 the resulting increased river leakage can lead to local groundwater level rise particularly in the middle of the alluvial lacustrine plain suggesting that future human activities such as building and farming should not be conducted in the middle of the alluvial lacustrine plain 5 conclusion an approach combining hydrochemistry stable isotopes d and 18o and radioisotopes 222rn was applied to study the interactions between surface water and groundwater in delingha northwest china according to the stable isotope characteristics it was found that the local water mainly originated from precipitation in the mountainous area the hydrochemical and isotopic results suggest that the interaction between surface water and groundwater shows spatial variability from the northern mountainous area to the terminal lake areas the groundwater receives bayin river leakage at the apex and middle areas of the alluvial proluvial plain north of sampling site r5 and generally discharges into the bayin river in the distal part of the alluvial proluvial plain and the upper part of the alluvial lacustrine plain area between sampling sites r5 and r7 in sequence there is a decreasing groundwater discharge into the bayin river in the middle area of the alluvial lacustrine plain area between sampling sites r7 and r10 accompanying the bayin river leakage in the area between sampling sites r7 and r8 hurleg lake mainly receives water from the bayin river and groundwater on the east side and discharges into the lianshui river which receives not only hurleg lake water but also groundwater however the terminal lake tuosu lake fed by lianshui river has intense evaporation which leads to salty lake water furthermore by using the 222rn mbm as well as the fbm the estimated groundwater discharge that mainly occurs in the alluvial lacustrine plain is 0 55 2 49 10 4 m3 s m and the river leakage rate in the upper and middle areas of the alluvial lacustrine plain is 1 65 3 19 10 4 m3 s m credit authorship contribution statement nuan yang investigation methodology writing original draft pengpeng zhou

4516,understanding the interactions between surface water and groundwater is of considerable significance for managing water resources and protecting ecosystems in arid and semi arid areas this study investigated the hydrochemistry stable isotopes d 18o and radioisotopes 222rn to identify the interactions between surface water and groundwater in delingha a typical arid area in northwest china in this area the surface water mainly consists of the bayin river which flows from the north mountainous area to the southwest terminal lake areas hurleg and tuosu lakes and the groundwater also generally flows from north to southwest and is characterized by a single layered sandy and gravelly aquifer in the alluvial proluvial plain and multi layered aquifers in the alluvial lacustrine plain the stable isotopes reveal that the water bodies in the plain are mainly recharged by precipitation in the mountainous area the hydrochemistry and isotopes results tds d 18o and 222rn combined with the groundwater level indicate that the surface water and groundwater interactions exhibit spatial variability it was found that the bayin river generally infiltrates into aquifer in the alluvial proluvial plain and repeatedly interchanges with groundwater in the alluvial lacustrine plain the flux rate of groundwater discharge in the alluvial lacustrine plain is estimated to be 0 55 2 49 10 4 m3 s m by the 222rn mass balance model showing a decreasing tendency along the flow path in addition the flux rate of river leakage occurring in the upper and middle areas of the alluvial lacustrine plain is estimated to be 1 65 3 19 10 4 m3 s m these findings provide a hydrological conceptual model and valuable flux data of water interchange for water resource management keywords 222rn water interaction recharge discharge processes spatial variability delingha 1 introduction in arid and semi arid areas groundwater is the primary water resource for life industry and agriculture and is vital for the protection of vulnerable ecosystems yang et al 2018 in this regard surface water bodies such as rivers and lakes are of considerable importance in the recharge and discharge of groundwater in regional aquifer systems understanding and quantitatively estimating the interactions between surface water and groundwater can allow the sustainable development of water utilization and eco environmental protection cartwright and hofmann 2015 chapman et al 2007 liao et al 2018 su et al 2015 yang et al 2020 for example estimation results of the interchange flux rate between surface water and groundwater can provide data to avoid the double counting of integrated water resources in quantity assessments and can support collaborative water management peranginangin et al 2004 singh 2014 in addition studying the interactions between surface water and groundwater is also necessary for better management of water quantity and quality because the development or pollution of groundwater or surface water can influence each other cook 2013 khan and khan 2019 winter 1999 zhu et al 2019 to effectively assess the interactions between surface water and groundwater several methods have been developed including those that use flow gauging cartwright et al 2013 harte and kiah 2009 mccallum et al 2012 electrical conductivity gilfedder et al 2015 lucía et al 2019 heat tracers anibas et al 2009 rau et al 2010 2017 numerical modeling kurylyk et al 2014 tian et al 2015 yang et al 2017 hydrochemistry cartwright et al 2011 cartwright and gilfedder 2015 kong et al 2019 stable isotopes such as δ2h and δ18o of water δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 of sulfate ratio of 87sr 86sr brenot et al 2015 wen et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 and radioactive isotopes cook et al 2008 gilfedder et al 2015 su et al 2015 yang et al 2020 among these methods hydrochemical parameters and isotopic tracers are relatively suitable for identifying and quantifying the spatial and temporal patterns of surface water and groundwater interactions on a regional scale gil márquez et al 2019 lucía et al 2019 xie et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 it has been proven that a variety of chemical and isotopic tracers can be used to study the interaction between groundwater and surface water for example the 2h i e d and 18o isotopes of water are useful natural tracers for qualitatively identifying water sources and quantitatively assessing groundwater inflows into surface water kong et al 2019 wen et al 2018 the analysis of the variation of hydrochemical parameters such as electrical conductivity and major ions particularly cl na and mg2 between surface water and groundwater can also effectively determine groundwater discharge into rivers cartwright et al 2011 gilfedder et al 2015 stellato et al 2008 chlorofluorocarbons cfcs have also been indicated as useful to quantitatively estimate the exchange flux of river and groundwater because cfcs have a significantly lower concentration in old groundwater compared to river water cook et al 2003 sulfur hexafluoride sf6 can also be used as a factor to indicate the river groundwater interaction cook et al 2006 anthropogenic gadolinium gd in the surface water as well as in adjacent groundwater can be analyzed to trace the mixing of surface water with groundwater boester and rüde 2020 strontium isotopes can also be used as tracers for groundwater surface water interactions frei et al 2020 in addition some radionuclides are also useful for studying the interaction between groundwater and surface water for example the u series such as 234u 238u ratio of river water has been used to calculate the flow contribution from deep and shallow aquifers navarro martinez et al 2017 schaffhauser et al 2014 radium ra which has a positive correlation with salinity is a useful tracer for determining the interaction between fresh groundwater and saline surface water moore 1996 2007 radon 222rn which is produced by the radioactive decay of 226ra and features a short half life of 3 83 days can diffuse into groundwater and reach a dynamic secular equilibrium between production and decay after approximately five half lives cecil and green 2000 cartwright and gilfedder 2015 the concentration of 222rn in surface water is considerably lower than that in groundwater due to radioactive decay and atmosphere evasion when 222rn rich groundwater flows into surface water the concentration of 222rn in surface water significantly increases cook et al 2008 ellins et al 1990 su et al 2015 yang et al 2020 thus 222rn is an excellent tracer for quantifying the water interchange flux between surface water and groundwater cartwright et al 2011 liao et al 2018 lucía et al 2019 stellato et al 2008 wu et al 2004 zhao et al 2018 delingha located in the northeast of the qaidam basin is a typical arid area and an important economic development zone of the silk road economic belt which is an infrastructure program to stimulate economic integration across the eurasian continent issues regarding water resources in the qaidam basin have attracted considerable attention because of scarce precipitation and intense evaporation qin 1999 sheng et al 2018 su et al 2015 xu et al 2017 yang et al 2018 yang and wang 2020 zhao et al 2018 for example zhang et al 2020 investigated groundwater evolution using hydrochemical methods liu et al 2014 showed that in the past 40 years the area of hurleg lake has remained unchanged whereas that of tuosu lake has considerably changed wen et al 2018 qualitatively analyzed the interaction between bayin river water and groundwater however they did not quantitatively estimate the water interaction flux along the flow direction and its spatial variability as it is important to estimate the water interaction flux in water resource management and eco environment protection it is meaningful to conduct an in depth study of the surface water and groundwater interaction in delingha in addition increasing precipitation has occurred in this region annual average precipitation from 1956 to 2013 is shown in fig s1 which has increased the surface runoff and groundwater level and has led to serious farmland inundation soil salinization and house collapses liu et al 2014 wen et al 2018 zhao and chen 2014 given this background it is urgent to understand and quantitatively estimate the interactions between groundwater and surface in this region in this study the hydrochemical parameters and isotopes d 18o and 222rn were used to reveal the water recharge source and identify the surface water and groundwater interactions along the flow path by using the 222rn mass balance model hereinafter referred to as 222rn mbm the exchange flux between groundwater and river water was quantitatively estimated this in depth evaluation of surface water and groundwater interaction in this study area will provide useful guidance for understanding the processes of the hydrologic cycle and for supporting water resource management 2 description of the study area the delingha study area is located in the northeast of the qaidam basin and surrounded by zongwulong mountain buhete mountain delingha uplift and denan hills in the north east west and south respectively fig 1 a the landform of this study area is characterized by a mountain alluvial proluvial plain and alluvial lacustrine plain from north to south fig 1a the delingha area has a typical plateau continental climate with an annual average temperature of 3 9 c the annual average precipitation is 169 3 mm yr approximately 85 of which occurs from may to september whereas the annual average evaporation reaches 2036 3 mm yr zhang et al 2020 the precipitation significantly increases with the terrain elevation and exceeds 450 mm yr in the zongwulong mountain as shown in fig 1a in the study area there are three rivers baishui bayin and lianshui rivers and three lakes hurleg tuosu and gahai lakes the 188 km long bayin river which is the dominant surface water body in this study area originates mainly from the zongwulong mountain with a catchment area of 7281 km2 and flows from east to west in areas between the zongwulong and buhete mountains when it merges at heishishan reservoir with the baishui river which is a 16 km long stream fed by springs in the south of zongwulong mountain and flows from north to south the bayin river starts to flow southward along the river flow path the bayin river generally leaks into the subsurface in the middle of the alluvial proluvial plain and reappears in the form of springs in the forefront of the alluvial proluvial plain when it flows towards the denan hills the bayin river starts to flow westward in the lower reaches due to denan hills and flows through the alluvial lacustrine plain finally discharging into hurleg lake located in the southwest of study area the hurleg lake water flows through the lianshui river into the tuosu lake a terminal lake located in the south of hurleg lake hurleg lake is characterized by freshwater with total dissolved solids tds 1 g l whereas the water in tuosu lake is salty gahai lake is another terminal salty lake located in the southeast of the study area with no hydraulic connectivity with the bayin river the midstream and downstream areas areas between heishishan reservoir and tuosu lake are the main study areas corresponding to alluvial proluvial plain and alluvial lacustrine plain respectively there are no evident tributaries during the two sampling periods november 2016 and march 2019 generally the relationship between the monthly average flow rate of the bayin river and precipitation indicates that the changes in monthly precipitation and river flow rates are consistent fig s2 rainfall or river flux increases from may to august and then declines until october in the delingha area the pre quaternary strata comprise sinian carboniferous dias triassic jurassic cretaceous and neogene strata zhang et al 2020 the dias and triassic strata with joints and fissures provide storage space for bedrock fissure water and the fracture karst is distributed in carboniferous strata these three strata are mainly distributed in the northern mountainous area limestone and shale are dominant in the carboniferous strata while the dias and triassic strata are composed of sandstone limestone and slate groundwater generally occurs in the porous media of quaternary unconsolidated sediments which are distributed throughout the plain area fig 1b at the apex and middle of the alluvial proluvial plain the single layered alluvial aquifer features a thickness exceeding 300 m and a large water table depth 80 120 m in the apex area and 10 30 m in the middle area and is composed of sand and gravel the aquifer system transforms from a single layered to multi layered structure with fine grained sediment and low water table depth 10 m in the distal part of the alluvial proluvial plain wen et al 2018 in the alluvial lacustrine plain distributed in the lower reaches of bayin river aquifer system are multi layered aquifers characterized by the interbedding of clay and fine sand zhang et al 2020 in this study region the groundwater initially flows from north to south and then turns to the west at the forefront of the alluvial proluvial plain owing to denan hills in the denan hills precipitation is rare and groundwater is difficult to form in the western part of the alluvial proluvial plain the groundwater flows from north to south and then to the southeast due to the delingha uplift but finally flows westward in the eastern part of the alluvial proluvial plain a small amount of groundwater flows southeast along the ancient river channel and merges into gahai lake fig 1a 3 materials

samples were analyzed in addition to the 222rn concentrations of 30 water samples which are a subset of the 38 samples in addition 10 precipitation rain and snow samples were also collected at the delingha seismic station thus a total of 62 samples were sampled during these two sampling periods table s1 the rain and snow melted indoors were funneled into 100 ml brown polyethylene bottles and sealed groundwater was sampled from wells springs and boreholes before groundwater sampling the groundwater in wells or boreholes was pumped out until the field hydrochemistry parameters were relatively stable to eliminate the impact of stagnant water the spring and artesian water samples were directly collected by a plastic tube the river waters collected from bayin and lianshui rivers and the lake waters collected from hurleg and tuosu lakes were collected near the shores using a hand held pump connected to a plastic tube during sampling one end of the tube was inserted 20 cm below the lake surface and close to the lake bottom and the other end was inserted into the bottom of the sampling bottle and slowly removed after water overflow all the water samples were filtered through membranes and stored in a polyethylene bottle which was rinsed 3 4 times using sampled water the water samples collected for anions and stable isotope d and 18o analyses were stored separately in 60 ml and 30 ml polyethylene bottles respectively and separate 60 ml water samples for cation analysis were acidified to ph 2 with concentrated nitric acid all bottles were sealed with wax to ensure a watertight seal the ph tds and temperature t were measured in the field using a portable parameter instrument the main cations k na ca2 and mg2 were tested by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes the main anions cl and so4 2 were analyzed by ion chromatography ics 2100 and the co3 2 and hco3 were analyzed by acid base titration the stable isotopes of water samples were tested by isotope ratio mass spectrometry and the results were expressed in the usual δ units calculated with respect to standard sample δsample r sample r standard 1 1000 where r sample and r standard represent the ratio of heavy to light isotopes of the sample and standard respectively a rad 7 detector durridge company inc was used to detect radon concentrations 222rn via α decay accounts 222rn concentrations in groundwater and surface water were measured differently a 250 ml sample of groundwater was carefully collected with a glass vial for detecting 222rn concentrations by a rad h2o system luo et al 2016 the groundwater in the vials was aerated for 5 min using the internal pump of rad 7 and the extracted radon gas was delivered to the rad 7 through a small drying tube the rad 7 performed counting for four 5 min periods after a stabilization period of 5 min unlike groundwater 2 5 l of surface water was collected into a glass jug for 222rn analysis using the big bottle system luo et al 2018 the surface water was aerated for 15 min the radon was moved from water into the rad 7 through a laboratory drying unit and the rad 7 instrument collected 11 readings over 5 min periods after a stabilization period of 15 min after testing a sample the rad 7 needed to be purged with dry air for 10 20 min to maintain its dryness and to eliminate the impact of one test on the next sample all relevant data are provided in the supplementary document table s1 3 2 222rn mass balance model to estimate the exchange flux between river water and groundwater we used the 222rn mbm established by su et al 2015 the radon mass balance between the upper and lower reaches of the river is expressed by the equation su et al 2015 1 q d c d q u c u δ m where q u and q d represent upstream and downstream river discharge m3 s respectively c u and c d are the 222rn concentrations of upstream and downstream stream water bq m3 respectively δ m is the 222rn variation between two river sampling sites which is attributed to the recharge from groundwater discharge river leakage radioactive decay atmospheric evasion inflow and outflow of tributaries and 226ra decay of riverine sediments because of the complex river groundwater interaction some assumptions needed to be considered as follow in this study area there are no impacts of local pumps and tributaries and the groundwater and river are the only recharge sources the impacts of precipitation and evaporation are negligible because the sampling work was performed in the dry season with less precipitation and the short runoff path between two sampling points leads to very low evaporation the river water has an evenly distributed 222rn concentration both in the horizontal and vertical directions cook 2013 yang et al 2020 222rn produced by 226ra decay in river water and riverbed sediments is insignificant wu et al 2004 hyporheic exchange is also not considered su et al 2015 the 222rn concentration due to radioactive decay and gas exchange in this model can be calculated by the following equations 2 c d c u exp α l 3 α β γ where α is the total loss coefficient radioactive decay and gas exchange ellins et al 1990 m 1 l is the distance between upstream and downstream river sampling points m and β is the 222rn radioactive decay coefficient corrected by the average river velocity of the upstream and downstream sections m 1 γ is the degassing loss coefficient m 1 radon loss caused by atmospheric evasion is described by the surface renewal theory which indicates that gas exchange is mainly due to turbulence danckwerts 1951 o connor and dobbins 1958 the 222rn radioactive decay coefficient and degassing loss coefficient can be described by peng et al 1974 ellins et al 1990 stellato et al 2008 4 β λ v 5 γ d 0 5 v 0 5 h 1 5 where λ is the radon radioactive decay constant 2 08 10 6 s 1 v and h are the average velocity m s and average river depth m of the river reach respectively and d is the 222rn molecular diffusion coefficient cm2 s which is a function of the absolute temperature t logd 980 t 1 59 due to the frequent conversion between river water and groundwater there are three river groundwater interaction situations fig s3 the mass conservation equations describing these three river groundwater interaction situations are expressed as follows su et al 2015 6 q d c d q u c u e a l

c d q u q d o r c u c d q u q d c where q g and q r are the groundwater discharge and river leakage per unit length m3 s m respectively and cg is the 222rn concentration of groundwater bq m3 for eq 6a the 222rn concentration and river discharge at the upstream sampling site are both lower than those at the downstream sampling site indicating the occurrence of groundwater discharge into the river for eq 6b the 222rn concentration and river discharge at the upstream sampling site are both higher than those at the downstream sampling site indicating the occurrence of river leakage for eq 6c the 222rn concentration and river discharge differences between the upstream and downstream sampling sites are opposite indicating the coexistence of river leakage and groundwater discharge assuming that they are evenly distributed along the river reaches then the analytic solutions eqs 7a 7b and 7c of eqs 6a 6b and 6c respectively are given as follows su et al 2015 7 q g c d q d c u e α l q u c g α 1

interaction along the river reaches which is used to determine the hydraulic transformation direction of river water and groundwater the river flow balance flow balance model abbreviated to fbm can be used as a reference for the 222rn mbm to obtain a more realistic calculation result 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical characteristics the results of the physicochemical parameters of groundwater and surface water are given in table 1 and table s1 the ph values of all the water samples ranged from 7 1 to 8 9 indicating that river water lake water and groundwater are neutral to slightly alkaline the ph values of groundwater and hurleg lake water 7 2 8 2 and 7 1 8 2 respectively are relatively lower than those of river water 7 6 8 7 and the ph values of tuosu lake water are the highest 8 2 8 9 the temperatures of surface water 0 3 10 1 c are generally lower than those of groundwater 7 1 11 3 c the temperature of the bayin river increases from low 0 3 4 0 c in the midstream reaches to high 2 0 10 1 c in the downstream reaches indicating groundwater discharge into the river at the downstream reaches in addition hurleg and tuosu lakes are characterized by low temperatures compared with the hurleg lake water temperature in other areas the lake water temperature 2 9 6 7 c is higher at the east side of the lake where it is directly fed by the bayin river and groundwater in conclusion the temperature of water can reveal the occurrence of hydraulic interactions between groundwater and downstream bayin river and hurleg lake the tds of river water and phreatic groundwater are 373 1 2766 0 mg l and 322 0 8954 0 mg l respectively showing an increasing tendency along the flow path fig 2 in contrast the tds content of confined groundwater which mainly occurs in the alluvial lacustrine plain fig 1 is relatively low and varies between 345 2 and 626 5 mg l implying that the interaction between phreatic groundwater and confined groundwater is relatively weak as shown in table s1 hurleg lake water is characterized by a low tds of 183 6 923 7 mg l generally fresh water like most groundwater and river samples however the lianshui river which receives inflow from hurleg lake showed high tds values of 2155 0 2766 0 mg l followed by those of tuosu lake fed by lianshui river 3859 0 7735 0 mg l which probably indicates evaporation and less recharge from groundwater from the piper plot fig 3 piper 1944 it can be seen that the hydrochemistry type of precipitation is so4 hco3 na ca the hydrochemistry of the bayin river changes from hco3 cl ca mg to cl hco3 so4 na ca mg along the flow path considering the groundwater from the alluvial proluvial plain to alluvial lacustrine plain group 1 to group 2 in fig 3 the major anions of phreatic water change from hco3 cl or hco3 so4 to so4 cl and cl so4 and the major cations change from ca na to na mg as shown in fig 3 the hydrochemistry types of phreatic groundwater and river water are generally similar revealing the relatively close interaction between phreatic groundwater and bayin river however the hydrochemistry type of confined groundwater is relatively simple hco3 cl ca na or hco3 so4 ca na the hydrochemistry types of hurleg lake water are hco3 cl na cl so4 na mg and cl na mg and that of the tuosu lake a terminal lake is cl so4 na mg similar to the difference in tds the difference in hydrochemistry types also implies that the recharge discharge processes of the two lakes are different 4 2 stable isotopic characteristics stable isotopes of hydrogen d and oxygen 18o represent a helpful tool for indicating hydrological process information such as recharge sources evaporation and mixing processes el sayed et al 2018 yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 the stable isotope compositions of precipitation surface water and groundwater are listed in table 1 and fig 4 the full dataset in table s1 all the surface water and groundwater samples are close to the global meteoric water line gmwl δd 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 suggesting that the water in this study area is recharged by meteoric precipitation for this study area the local meteoric water line lmwl in the plain is δd 8 47δ18o 15 2 tian et al 2001 the local evaporation line lel is δd 5 12δ18o 12 88 r2 0 98 with the slope and intercept being smaller than those of the lmwl related to the arid climate characteristics of this study area rain and snow samples were collected in the north of the plain area middle area between r1 and r2 i e area marked by the red star in fig 1a as shown in table 1 the average values of δd and δ18o for snowfall are 78 40 and 11 50 respectively however the isotope data of rainfall collected in summer are more enriched with average values of 13 27 and 2 12 for δd and δ18o respectively the stable isotopes of river water and groundwater are from 67 35 to 45 12 for δd and from 10 41 to 6 09 for δ18o which are more depleted than those of rainfall but more enriched than those of snowfall however most surface water and groundwater samples are mainly located to the left of the lmwl fig 4a implying that little precipitation in the plain area recharges groundwater and surface water in addition according to previous studies of local moisture recycling froehlich et al 2008 kong and pang 2016 the water vapor generated by evaporation can be transported to the mountainous area and then condenses into precipitation which is characterized by high d excess and is located to the left of the lmwl in the plain area furthermore as shown in fig s2 the time series curve of the bayin river flow rate is similar to that of precipitation indicating that the dynamic of river flow rate is mainly controlled by precipitation dynamic thus we can conclude that the precipitation in mountain area is the main recharge source of local water which is consistent with the results of a previous study wen et al 2018 the isotopic ratios of bayin river samples vary from 61 98 to 56 04 for δd and from 9 50 to 8 55 for δ18o with average values of 58 82 and 9 05 respectively from fig 4b it can be seen that the bayin river samples are located in the same area as the phreatic groundwater however compared with the bayin river samples the lianshui river and lake samples mainly featured enriched isotopic signatures moreover it can also be seen that the stable isotope concentrations of tuosu lake δd 35 02 to 8 39 δ18o 3 95 to 3 45 are higher than those of hurleg lake δd 56 14 to 39 20 δ18o 8 64 to 5 59 the isotopic ratios of hurleg lake are generally closer to those of phreatic water and bayin river water the isotopic values δd 56 03 to 45 12 δ18o 8 06 to 6 09 of lianshui river fig 1 connecting the two lakes tuosu and hurleg lakes are slightly lower than those of hurleg lake δd and δ18o of phreatic groundwater change from 64 60 to 55 11 and 10 20 to 8 65 with averages of 59 48 and 9 22 respectively table 1 the linear regression line of phreatic groundwater is δd 5 84δ18o 5 59 r2 0 60 with the slope and intercept smaller than those of the gmwl indicating that the phreatic groundwater underwent evaporation however δd and δ18o of confined groundwater ranges from 67 35 to 60 27 and 10 41 to 9 39 with average values of 65 20 and 10 08 respectively which are slightly depleted compared to those of phreatic groundwater table 1 in addition the confined water samples are located at the lower left of phreatic water implying that the confined groundwater was not subjected to evaporation 4 3 spatial distribution characteristics of water interactions 4 3 1 indications from stable isotopes along the flow path of the bayin river variations in stable isotopes of groundwater and river water were analyzed to identify the spatial distribution characteristics of water interactions as shown in fig 5 the close stable isotopic compositions of the bayin river water and phreatic groundwater indicate the frequent hydraulic connections between them δd and δ18o of the bayin river show an evident fluctuation in the midstream reaches 0 30 km and are stable δd 59 18 to 56 40 δ18o 9 27 to 8 55 in the downstream reaches 30 55 km however the stable isotopes of groundwater are enriched first and then depleted from 59 84 to 55 11 to 63 65 for δd and from 9 08 to 8 65 to 9 65 for δ18o reflecting the effects of evaporation on groundwater in the distal parts of the alluvial proluvial plain with water depths 10 m p3 and p4 areas in fig 1b the most depleted δd and δ18o values of groundwater occur at location of about 40 km where the hydrogeological structure changes from single layered to multi layered aquifer which indicates the weakest evaporation effect in this area in addition in the alluvial proluvial plain 30 km the stable isotopic ratios of river water r2 r3 r4 and r5 are close to those of groundwater p1 p2 p3 and p4 but clearly decrease at 25 km indicating that the river groundwater interaction changes from receiving river leakage to groundwater discharge into the river at 25 km however in the downstream reaches 30 km the isotopic values of groundwater p9 and p14 are relatively similar to those of river water r7 and r8 and the isotopic values of groundwater show an increasing tendency along the flow path from 63 65 to 59 20 and 9 65 to 9 30 for δd and δ18o respectively implying the occurrence of river leakage the variation in stable isotopes of the terminal lakes hurleg and tuosu lakes and lianshui river are shown in fig 5 as shown the isotopic ratios of hurleg lake are closer to the phreatic water and bayin river water which indicates that the hurleg lake is directly recharged by the bayin river and phreatic groundwater the stable isotopes of the lianshui river r12 with 56 03 δd and 8 06 δ18o are significantly smaller than those of hurleg lake hl with 49 85 δd and 7 28 δ18o indicating that the lianshui river is also recharged by local groundwater with depleted isotopes by comparison it was found that the stable isotopes of tuosu lake tl 23 71 δd and 2 01 δ18o are more enriched than those of lianshui river and hurleg lake implying that the tuosu lake is constantly undergoing evaporation 4 3 2 indications from 222rn to further identify the interactions between groundwater and surface water the 222rn concentrations of groundwater river and lake water were analyzed in this section fig 6 and table 2 the 222rn concentrations of groundwater 6166 05 29848 65 bq m3 are 1 3 orders of magnitude larger than those of river water 63 00 1722 41 bq m3 along the flow path of the bayin river the 222rn concentration of river water changes showing a tendency of first increasing from 106 40 bq m3 sample site r2 to 1722 41 bq m3 sample site r6 and then decreasing to 365 72 bq m3 sample site r10 however as shown in fig 6 and table 2 the 222rn concentration of groundwater decreased first from 29848 65 to 8768 53 bq m3 and then increased to 18919 91 bq m3 at the apex and middle of the alluvial proluvial plain 20 km after flowing out of the heishishan reservoir the 222rn concentration of bayin river water r2 r3 and r4 with an average value of 81 70 bq m3 shows a slightly decrease from 106 40 to 63 00 bq m3 owing to radioactive decay and gas exchange wu et al 2004 zhao et al 2018 however the 222rn concentrations of groundwater p1 p2 and p3 significantly decreased from 29848 65 to 8768 53 bq m3 implying that the groundwater at the apex and middle of the alluvial proluvial plain 20 km fig 6 is recharged from bayin river leakage in addition the groundwater flow field fig 7 which shows a groundwater level less than the river stage is another evidence of river leakage into groundwater in this area at the front edge of the alluvial proluvial plain and the upper part of the alluvial lacustrine plain approximately 20 45 km the 222rn concentration of groundwater gradually increases from 8768 53 to 18919 91 bq m3 p3 to p4 and p21 fig 6 and table 2 it should be noted that the 222rn concentration of spring p7 6166 05 bq m3 is minimal due to gas exchange and radioactive decay after overflowing the surface the bayin river also has a high 222rn concentration of approximately 805 95 1722 41 bq m3 r5 r6 and r7 fig 6 suggesting that the bayin river is recharged by groundwater in this river reach moreover as shown in fig 7 the local higher groundwater level than the river stage also demonstrates the occurrence of local groundwater discharge into the bayin river in the distal and middle parts of the alluvial lacustrine plain further than 45 km the 222rn concentration of river water decreases from 653 58 bq m3 r8 to 365 72 bq m3 r10 with increasing distance possibly indicating a decrease in groundwater discharge into the river in this area as the terminal end of this regional water flow system hurleg lake has a relatively low 222rn concentration from 7 63 to 362 81 bq m3 with an average value of 112 65 bq m3 which is generally related to radioactive decay and atmospheric escape in addition as shown in fig 6 the spatial distribution of 222rn concentrations in the hurleg lake area shows that the highest 222rn concentration 362 81 bq m3 is adjacent to the bayin river indicating river discharge into hurleg lake then after the hurleg lake water flows into the lianshui river the 222rn concentration again shows a significant increasing tendency and reaches a maximum value of 617 75 bq m3 r12 possibly indicating local groundwater discharge into the lianshui river which is consistent with the results of stable isotopic analysis finally when the lianshui river flows into tuosu lake the 222rn concentrations 18 03 35 04 bq m3 are low again with an average value of 26 50 bq m3 owing to atmospheric escape and radioactive decay in summary according to the characteristics of d and 18o stable isotopes and 222rn on the one hand the groundwater receives river leakage at the apex and middle of alluvial proluvial plain and discharges into the bayin river at the front edge of alluvial proluvial plain and the upper alluvial lacustrine plain then has decreasing groundwater discharge in the distal and middle parts of the alluvial lacustrine plain on the other hand hurleg lake mainly recharges from the bayin river and groundwater on the east side and discharges into the lianshui river which receives not only hurleg lake water but also groundwater and finally feeds the tuosu lake 4 4 quantificational estimation of water interactions using 222rn mbm as analyzed in the above sections the hydrochemical and isotopic results reveal the spatial distribution characteristics of interactions between groundwater and surface water along the flow direction to further estimate the exchange flux between groundwater and river in the downstream reaches of bayin river the area between sampling sites r5 and r10 where the groundwater discharge occurs the 222rn mbm and the fbm were applied in the calculation with those models the parameter d 222rn molecular diffusion coefficient was calculated based on the temperature of river water cg was the average 222rn concentration of groundwater samples p4 and p21 cg 17097 75 bq m3 and the sectional flow flux q u and q d was calculated using the monitored average flow velocity and sectional area of the sampling sites r5 r6 r7 r8 and r10 the calculation results are displayed in table 3a and 3b a schematic representation is provided to show the groundwater surface water interaction fig 8 as shown in table 3a in the river reach of r5 r6 the 222rn concentration as well as the river discharge at the upstream sampling site r5 is lower than that at the downstream sampling site r6 thus eq 6a was chosen to calculate the groundwater discharge into this river reach the groundwater discharge calculated by the fbm and 222rn mbm were 0 60 10 4 m3 s m and 2 13 10 4 m3 s m respectively this latter discharge flux is considerably larger than the former in addition as shown in fig 7 the groundwater level is higher than the river stage in some parts and lower in others indicating the coexistence of groundwater discharge and river leakage in this river reach from r5 to r6 thus q g and q r need to be recalculated using eq 6c the recalculated results of q g and q r are 2 25 10 4 m3 s m and 1 65 10 4 m3 s m respectively the result of net groundwater discharge q g q r 2 25 1 65 10 4 0 60 10 4 m3 s m is consistent with the result of fbm 0 60 10 4 m3 s m table 3a in the river reach of r6 r7 the different variation patterns of river discharge and 222rn concentration between upstream and downstream suggest that eq 6c should be used to calculate the river leakage and groundwater discharge the results show that the estimated river leakage is negative which indicates the inexistence of river leakage in this river reach in addition the groundwater discharge 2 49 10 4 m3 s m was estimated by 222rn mbm in the river reach of r7 r8 the river discharge and 222rn concentration downstream are both less than those upstream implying the occurrence of river leakage however the result of river leakage calculated by eq 6b is negative and the 222rn concentration downstream r8 is lightly high 653 58 bq m3 indicating the coexistence of river leakage and groundwater discharge within this river reach thus eq 6c should be used to recalculate q r and q g which are 3 19 10 4 m3 s m and 0 56 10 4 m3 s m respectively this relatively larger flux rate of river leakage implies that river leakage into groundwater is the major hydrological process in this river reach of r7 r8 for the river reach of r8 r10 like r6 r7 eq 6c was used according to the variations of 222rn concentration and river flow rate from upstream to downstream the groundwater discharge 0 55 10 4 m3 s m was estimated by the 222rn mbm in conclusion the interaction between surface water and groundwater in delingha was determined using hydrochemical and isotopic analyses in this study as shown in the conceptual diagram of water interaction between surface water and phreatic aquifer fig 8 bayin river water mainly infiltrates the phreatic aquifer at the apex and middle parts of the alluvial proluvial plain where there is a considerable water table depth areas between sampling sites r1 and r5 in the areas of the distal part of the alluvial proluvial plain and the upper part of the alluvial lacustrine plain areas between sampling sites r5 and r7 as the water table increases groundwater generally discharges into the bayin river with estimated discharge rates of 2 25 2 49 10 4 m3 s m table 3b however due to the heterogeneity of the groundwater level distribution fig 7 part of the groundwater receives river leakage in areas between sampling sites r5 and r6 with an estimated leakage value of 1 65 10 4 m3 s m table 3b then in the middle part of the alluvial lacustrine plain areas between sampling sites r7 and r10 less groundwater discharges into the bayin river with flux rates of 0 55 0 56 10 4 m3 s m table 3b and river water leakage occurs in some areas between sampling sites r7 and r8 with a high leakage rate of 3 19 10 4 m3 s m table 3b in general our results have revealed the spatial variability of the interaction between surface water and groundwater which contributes to the local hydrologic processes in addition the estimated results of bayin river leakage and groundwater discharge are key water budget data for reasonable water resource assessment furthermore the runoff in bayin river which is one of the important recharge sources of local groundwater zhou 2016 has increased in recent years liu et al 2014 wen et al 2018 the resulting increased river leakage can lead to local groundwater level rise particularly in the middle of the alluvial lacustrine plain suggesting that future human activities such as building and farming should not be conducted in the middle of the alluvial lacustrine plain 5 conclusion an approach combining hydrochemistry stable isotopes d and 18o and radioisotopes 222rn was applied to study the interactions between surface water and groundwater in delingha northwest china according to the stable isotope characteristics it was found that the local water mainly originated from precipitation in the mountainous area the hydrochemical and isotopic results suggest that the interaction between surface water and groundwater shows spatial variability from the northern mountainous area to the terminal lake areas the groundwater receives bayin river leakage at the apex and middle areas of the alluvial proluvial plain north of sampling site r5 and generally discharges into the bayin river in the distal part of the alluvial proluvial plain and the upper part of the alluvial lacustrine plain area between sampling sites r5 and r7 in sequence there is a decreasing groundwater discharge into the bayin river in the middle area of the alluvial lacustrine plain area between sampling sites r7 and r10 accompanying the bayin river leakage in the area between sampling sites r7 and r8 hurleg lake mainly receives water from the bayin river and groundwater on the east side and discharges into the lianshui river which receives not only hurleg lake water but also groundwater however the terminal lake tuosu lake fed by lianshui river has intense evaporation which leads to salty lake water furthermore by using the 222rn mbm as well as the fbm the estimated groundwater discharge that mainly occurs in the alluvial lacustrine plain is 0 55 2 49 10 4 m3 s m and the river leakage rate in the upper and middle areas of the alluvial lacustrine plain is 1 65 3 19 10 4 m3 s m credit authorship contribution statement nuan yang investigation methodology writing original draft pengpeng zhou

4517,the current difficulties in determining the ecological flow of rivers in northern china are the poor pertinence of methods and insufficient consideration of ecological factors on the basis of systematic analysis of river hydrological situations and ecological protection objectives the existing water ecological problems in river reaches were identified a nested calculation framework for ecological flow of rivers was given based on nature based solutions nbs considering the ecological integrity biological diversity morphological diversity and ecological service functions with help of physical habitat simulation and the penman monteith formula indicator species were selected to research the natural process of restoring river function and realizing river runoff to meet the water requirements of riparian vegetation during the growth period of the indicated species the water demand law of typical vegetation changing with the growth time was studied the upper and lower water levels were set and the ecological water requirements of vegetation at each growth stage were determined the results showed that the ecological basic flows required for the spawning period april june the juvenile period july november and the growth period december march of pseudorasbora parva in the long river typical section were 3 14 m3 s 4 32 m3 s and 2 16 m3 s respectively at the end of the spawning period a 7 day 90 guarantee rate pulse flow with a peak flow of 11 31 m3 s a small flood process with a peak flow of 24 95 m3 s and a small flood process in the flood season lasting for 3 days provided effective external stimulation for the spawning of pseudorasbora parva the minimum annual ecological water requirement of reed was 15 100 m3 the current ecological flow of the long river can meet the water requirements of most aquatic organisms and plants in the river ecosystem the ecological flow calculation method based on nbs is widely applicable and the results are representative the method can be used to calculate the ecological flow of small and medium sized northern rivers with a small flow and low flow rate keywords ecological flow nature based solutions ecological water requirements indicator species physical habitat simulation quantitative analysis 1 introduction at present most river ecosystems are facing human induced disturbances such as water depletion water pollution landscape change overutilization of biological resources and changes in hydrological conditions and natural disturbances such as floods droughts and soil erosion he et al 2008 the river ecosystem has begun to show signs of degradation in terms of species composition community structure and ecological function chen tao 2015 the concept of ecological flow was put forward to curb the degradation of river ecosystems caused by excessive water use there is no uniform standard for the definition of ecological flow the main international terms related to ecological flow imply a certain amount of water maintained or discharged in an aquatic ecosystem to achieve a specific goal of the ecosystem which takes into account both the needs of ecosystem health and economic and social development at present research on ecological flow has gone through three stages theoretical germination popularization and expansion and hydro ecological perspective development the theoretical embryonic stage refers to the late 1940s 1960s which is mainly based on practical experience to determine ecological flow there is no systematic calculation method for this stage dong et al 2017 the popularization and expansion stage refers to the early 1970s to the late 1990s when researchers extended and refined the connotation of ecological flow the most important research achievements in this stage are reflected in the development of various calculation methods namely the hydrology method hydro habitat method and integral method tennant 1976 armour taylor 1991 petts 1996 gleick 1998 crawford 2000 a variety of ecological flow calculation methods are used synthetically which greatly improves the application of ecological flow measures in china ma et al 2018 in the 21st century the development of ecological flow has entered the stage of the hydro ecological perspective based on the ecological significance of undisturbed natural flow and its important role in supporting the biodiversity of river ecosystems poff et al 1997 proposed the theory of nature flow paradigm nfp which was the first time the theory of ecological flow based on the relationship between hydro ecological change and ecological response was studied the calculation method of ecological flow based on specific ecological protection targets has also been developed and the research theories and calculation methods such as sustainable boundaries the development space concept and the ecological limits of hydrologic alteration eloha have promoted the development of ecological flow from the hydro ecological perspective postel richtre 2002 king brown 2010 poff et al 2010 the eloha framework does not prescribe a specific hydrological assessment tool or scientifically calculation method to quantifying ecological flow poff et al 2010 the calculation methods don t fully consider factors such as river topography meandering river lake relationship physical and chemical characteristics of water bodies material flow information flow species flow the calculation results can only meet the ecological requirements of the indicated species but not necessarily the needs of the water ecosystem in the basin people are working to solve the impact of human activities on the river ecosystem and have realized the value of nature itself so it is urgent to manage and maintain the value of ecosystem services scholars have proposed the concept of nature based solutions nbs to try to provide new ideas for solving the problem of traditional engineering interventions that cannot achieve the dual goals of economic growth and sustainability fu et al 2018a zhang et al 2019 it is becoming increasingly important to carry out relevant research focusing on the restoration of river habitats and a series of studies on the watershed scale based on ecological information management river health assessment ecological planning and the response mechanism of various disturbance factors and ecological factors have been performed fu et al 2018b this paper is structured as follows 1 introduction elaborating on the background and theoretical significance of the research subject in this paper 2 theory study with subsections on the 1 nbs which is based on diversified ecosystems and sustainable development and 2 ecological flow which is based on biological needs and natural flow

empirical formula and statistics software and 3 supply the plot of the habitat suitability curve 4 results and discussion and 54 conclusions an integrated system was proposed to calculate ecological flow based on nbs watershed water resources and water consumption fig 1 there is an urgent need to carry out measurements of river ecological flow water quantity based on nbs in the framework of ecological natural harmonious development aiming at developing a method to calculate the ecological flow and its applicable scope with the restoration of water flow naturalization as the core 2 theory study 2 1 nbs nbs emphasize the contribution of well managed and diversified ecosystems to improving human resilience and sustainable development focusing on the enhancement of ecosystem services except for two scientific introductions the term nbs mainly appears in policy documents and it has not been widely used in the scientific literature until recently eggermont et al 2015 kabisch et al 2016 maes and jacobs 2017 the international union for conservation of nature defines nbs as the behaviour of protecting sustainably managing and restoring nature or improving an ecosystem so that it can effectively adapt to local conditions to meet social challenges and at the same time these behaviours can provide human welfare and produce biodiversity benefits the european commission 2011 defines nbs as a method to address social challenges inspired and supported by nature this method is cost effective can provide environmental social and economic benefits and helps to improve the resilience of ecosystems nbs can provide a variety of water related solutions which can help solve many problems such as water quantity water quality and wading risk management nbs mainly solve the problem of water supply by managing the processes of precipitation water storage infiltration and transmission thus improving the spatial distribution and time allocation of water resources available for human use the potential power of nature can provide solutions to global challenges in the fields of climate change food security social and economic development etc eggermont et al 2015 healthy diversified and well managed water ecosystems can provide a basis for solving practical problems of the water environment based on the concept of nature environmental social and economic challenges are transformed into an innovative mechanism of multiple dynamic coupling with the help of natural forces and complex logical reasoning to create a sustainable and multifunctional basin water ecosystem and landscape that can be used to improve the service value of the basin ecosystem and realize good water ecological health of the basin 2 2 ecological flow the natural hydrological process has a natural rationality the biological geomorphic physical and chemical processes of rivers are highly dependent on natural hydrological processes although the abiotic processes of rivers have changed to varying degrees due to the interference of human activities organisms also show many reactions such as active escape passive patience and active adaptation however considering the preference for specific water flow conditions that formed during the evolution of organisms over tens of thousands or even hundreds of millions of years natural water flow is still an ideal hydrological situation for most organisms at present it is impossible to completely restore the river flow process to the undisturbed natural state because the large scale water intake by humans and the regulation of reservoir runoff not only change the river natural runoff process but also affect the river hydrological situation based on nbs it is of great significance to determine the ecological flow with the natural hydrological situation as a benchmark for protecting most organisms and maintaining the integrity of the river ecosystem under the condition that river function cannot be completely restored to natural conditions partial restoration of the natural runoff process will be beneficial for improving the river water environment and maintaining a healthy habitat the determination of ecological flow based on nbs is based on the requirement of the watershed ecosystem itself which is convenient to reflect the change of the water requirements caused by natural changes and biophysical changes ten et al 2012 dudley et al 2010 in this paper based on nbs indicator species were selected and the penman monteith formula method based on a habitat simulation of indicator fish and the water requirement process of vegetation was adopted to determine the ecological flow quantity of the long river which is regarded as having an approximate natural flow state the flow process in this state can ensure the change of the water demand of the indicator fish and typical vegetation in the riparian zone 3 method analysis 3 1 selection of indicator species in the process of determining the ecological flow of the long river how to select a suitable target species and construct a suitability curve of this species to the flow process are very important the biological conditions in the study area combined with the ecological flow are used to select representative indicator species the target species commonly used internationally to determine ecological flow are salmon and sturgeon which are generally not applicable to rivers in north china the four major chinese carps mylopharyngodon piceus ctenopharynodon idellus hypophthalmichthys molitrix and aristichthys nobilis which are widely used in the study of determining the ecological flow limit in china are of little significance for determining the ecological restoration of rivers in north china because their populations in the rivers of north china are not large or are evenly distributed wang et al 2019 the selection of typical indigenous dominant fishes as indicator aquatic organisms can protect the river ecology in the region to the greatest extent and guide the development of regional ecological flow work the distribution and quantity of aquatic plants are closely related to changes in habitats the amount of water determines the structural changes of the plant community and the succession direction of the community to a certain extent aquatic vegetation will adapt to changes caused by changes in water conditions different vegetation communities may have different succession processes or results due to their different response intensities and sensitivities to water changes zhang et al 2020 in the process of determining the ecological flow of a river riparian vegetation is selected as the indicator species which can fully characterize the horizontal connectivity function of the river as riparian vegetation is mainly affected by floodplain flow it has a certain reference value for determining the sensitive ecological flow however the vegetation coverage rate of the riparian zone of some rivers with large artificial disturbances is relatively low yue et al 2019 therefore selecting dominant populations with strong vitality and obvious water demand characteristics as indicator species is an effective means to guide the formulation of ecological flows 3 2 calculation of ecological flow the complexity of the physical habitat has an important impact on the species richness of biological communities generally speaking the complexity of a physical habitat is positively correlated with the richness of the biological communities and species diversity in the habitat a suitable habitat area of a river is affected by factors such as flow velocity water depth distribution river matrix and water surface coverage the living habits and life cycle activities of indicator fish are strongly disturbed by changes in hydrological conditions therefore this work is based on nbs and the use of the habitat simulation method has important ecological value for studying the ecological flow of indicator fish many ecological flow determination methods use natural water flow as a reference such as the tennant method and eloha framework the representative ecological flow determination methods that directly apply the natural flow paradigm are the natural flow sensitive period simulation method and the variability range method this paper uses the phabsim physical habitat simulation system hydraulic model to estimate the water depth and flow velocity of each sub section of the study area which provides a hydraulic foundation for the determination of the suitable habitat area the phabsim model believes that there is a suitability relationship between the life history traits of aquatic species and hydraulic conditions the habitat needs of organisms at different life history stages can be evaluated according to hydraulic condition variables preference for certain types of hydraulic conditions can be expressed by the habitat suitability index organisms can choose hydraulic conditions at different stages of their life history to deal with the impact of environmental changes wang et al 2018 select representative sections of this study determine and obtain the river bottom elevation data of each section through on site measurements including the measurement of at least 3 corrected flows at the control hydrological station and the water depth and velocity corresponding to the corrected flows the phabsim model is established on the basis of the relative distance between the various sections the large section data the corrected water level and the flow velocity and a simulation is carried out with the help of a one dimensional hydraulic formula 3 2 1 simulate water depth in the phabsim model the water depth of each district can be determined by the difference between the water level elevation and the river bottom elevation this paper uses the stgq log log regression mansq channel conveyance and wsp step backwater procedures included in the phabsim model to estimate the water level corresponding to the different flows of each river section the stgq method also called the logarithmic logarithmic regression method is a water level and flow regression method the stgq method uses historical hydrological data of each section of the river to derive the parameters a and b of the water level and flow regression equation respectively in the stgq program to calculate the different flows of river sections the equation is 1 w s l s z f a q b where wsl is the water level elevation m szf is the section water level m q is the flow rate m3 s a is a constant related to the flow rate and the measured value of the water level and b is the measured value coefficient of the flow rate and the water level the mansq method also called the channel transportation method is a water level flow simulation method based on the manning formula using the flow and water depth data of the river sections the roughness manning n value of each section is calculated and the manning formula is substituted to estimate the water depth corresponding to the change in flow since the water passing area a and hydraulic radius r of the section are both functions of the water depth d the formula for a uniform water body is as follows 2 q 1 n g d where g d is the functional relationship that changes with the section shape and the slope of the riverbed the wsp method is also called the step push backwater method the wsp method uses the gradual flow surface line equation to calculate the water depth of each upstream section one by one from a downstream initial section with the standard step method this method has higher requirements for the water depth of the downstream section 3 2 2 velocity simulation the currently used velocity calculation method has very high requirements for the measured water depth and velocity value data the most representative measured velocity value is input into the phabsim model to calculate the manning n value and the velocity value under other flow conditions can be calculated the manning n value is very important for selecting the representative flow rate which may affect the final result and can be verified based on the actual measured calibration flow the speed regression calculation method uses the autoregressive equation to calculate using this method requires at least two sets of measured data for regression analysis when the application conditions are not met the phabsim model will automatically use the known speed calculation method for calculation the formula for the speed regression calculation method is 3 v α q γ where α and γ are undetermined coefficients q is the flow rate m3 s and v is the flow velocity m s the water depth calculation method expresses the flow velocity as a function of water depth the function relationship is determined by the characteristics of the section the velocity of each zone is calculated by manning s formula the equation is 4 v 1 n f d where n is the roughness d is the water depth m the water depth calculation method is widely used for estimating the cross section flow velocity when there are no measured velocity data the phabsim model provides a velocity adjustment factor vaf to effectively evaluate the flow velocity error calculated by the water depth calculation method to complete the correction work 3 3 calculation of ecological water quantity the factors that affect the determination of the vegetation ecological water demand mainly include climatic factors soil moisture and differences in vegetation types the basic physiological water demand of plants only accounts for a small part of the total water demand of plants which can be ignored the actual water demand of plants is regarded as the ecological water demand of vegetation vegetation evapotranspiration is mainly determined by the vegetation types and meteorological conditions in the study area the vegetation coefficient can reflect the biological characteristics of the vegetation itself and is mainly affected by factors such as the length of the growth period and the leaf surface index of the vegetation community the soil moisture limitation coefficient mainly reflects the influence of soil moisture status on plant transpiration there is a correlation between ecological water demand and ecological water consumption and the degree of satisfaction of the ecological water demand determines the health of the ecosystem the ecological water consumption of vegetation is the water consumption of evapotranspiration for river wetland vegetation the satisfaction degree of vegetation water demand can be reflected by the difference between the actual evapotranspiration and the vegetation water demand corresponding to the vegetation growth conditions to calculate plant evapotranspiration the improved penman monteith formula method paredes et al 2020 is usually used the calculation equation is 5 e t c k c k s e t 0 w p e t c a p 1000 where etc is the vegetation ecological water requirement mm et0 is the indicator vegetation evapotranspiration mm kc is the vegetation coefficient ks is the soil moisture limit coefficient wp is the vegetation ecological water requirement m3 and ap is the vegetation distribution area m2 the improved penman formula method is used to calculate the actual water demand of plants by calculating the potential evapotranspiration of plants the calculation formula used to determine the potential evapotranspiration of vegetation is that recommended by the fao mccoll 2020 6 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 e s e a t 273 δ γ i 0 34 u 2 where rn is the net radiation on the surface of the canopy mj m2 d g is the soil heat flux mj m2 d t is the average temperature es is the saturated vapour pressure kpa ea is the actual water vapour pressure kpa is the tangent slope of the relationship between the saturated water vapour pressure and air temperature at t kpa γ is the hygrometer constant kpa and u2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s 3 3 1 the determination of kc to reflect the biological characteristics of the vegetation itself the determination of kc is affected by factors such as the length of the vegetation growth period and the leaf surface index this study uses the piecewise single value average crop coefficient method proposed by the united nations food and agriculture organization fao to determine kc generalizes the change process of the vegetation coefficient into four stages early growth development mid growth and late growth and uses the average value of this period as the crop coefficient of this stage allen et al 1998 reed is taken as an example ① in the early growth period 4 5 months the vegetation coverage rate is from germination to nearly 10 the vegetation coefficient at this stage is kc ini during the development period june july the vegetation coverage rate ranges from 10 to effective full coverage and the vegetation coefficient increases from kc ini to kc mid at this stage in the mid growth period august to september the vegetation gradually matures the signs of maturity are yellow leaves and fallen leaves the vegetation coefficient at this stage is kc mid in the late growth period october november from vegetation maturity to senescence the sign of senescence is that the vegetation naturally becomes dry or dead leaves are lost the vegetation coefficient at this stage is kc end in the process of determining kc it is necessary to take the average value of the upper and lower thresholds of the vegetation coefficient during the development and later stages of growth the vegetation coefficient kc ini at the initial stage of growth depends on the time interval of soil moisture in the study area the degree of soil moisture and the ability of the soil moisture to undergo atmospheric evaporation this study refers to the method used to determine the land vegetation coefficient that is the humid time interval is expressed as the ratio of the total number of days in the initial growth period to the number of rainfalls during the period kc ini is determined by checking the relationship between the time interval of soil humidification and the monthly average et 0 fig 2 the vegetation coefficient kc mid in the middle growth stage is determined according to the leaf area index the method used to calculate kc mid is 7 k c m i d k cp 0 05 0 10 k cp k c min k cfull k c min 1 e 0 7 l a i k cfull k c h 0 04 u 2 2 r h min 45 h a 0 3 l a i l a i den n n den β where kcp is the vegetation coefficient under the condition of incomplete coverage kc min is the minimum vegetation coefficient of bare soil when vegetation is lacking 0 15 0 20 kcfull is the vegetation coefficient under the condition of full coverage kc h is the standard wind speed the full coverage vegetation coefficient under humidity conditions when h 2 kc h 1 2 and when h 2 kc h 1 0 1 h rhmin is the average daily minimum relative humidity during the calculation period h is the average plant height in the calculation period m p is the number of plants per unit of ground cover area under actual growth conditions lai is the actual leaf area index and pden is the unit surface cover under normal growth density or the original growth conditions when p is the number of plants when the vegetation is growing vigorously β 0 5 when p is the number of plants when the vegetation is not growing vigorously β 1 the vegetation coefficient kc end in the later stage of growth can be determined at a certain proportion according to the growth status of reeds and the leaf area index based on the measured data of vegetation in the study area this study reversely calculates kc end 3 3 2 the determination of ks the soil moisture limitation coefficient ks mainly reflects the influence of soil moisture status on plant transpiration under conditions of insufficient irrigation or insufficient water in the absence of soil moisture dynamic monitoring data the following equation can be used to calculate ks 8 k s 1 η η c η η s η c η s η s η η c 0 η η s where η is the soil moisture

wither withering coefficient m3 m3 3 4 plot of the habitat suitability curve the habitat suitability curve hsc of fish was plotted according to the habitat suitability standard of the indicator fish to determine the habitat suitability criteria first the indicator species should be selected in the study area and their habitat characteristics should be determined by means of a life habit and environmental investigation the habitat suitability index should be correlated with the impact factors of the target species habitat where the suitable and restricted conditions are assigned to 1 and 0 respectively the determination of the habitat suitability criteria is the biological basis of the habitat simulation method and its authenticity and accuracy determine the success of the habitat simulation ying 2006 flow velocity water depth substrate and cover are the main environmental factors that affect species number and distribution a habitat model simulation is based on three basic assumptions there is a quantitative relationship between habitat suitability and the flow of the simulated target fish the habitat factors such as flow velocity and water depth affect the quantity and distribution of the target fish species and the riverbed conditions are stable during the model simulation and do not change with the flow rate according to the habitat suitability curve of the fish and the simulation results of the flow rate and water depth in each section of the channel cross section the model can combine the suitability factors of different habitat factors to obtain the combined suitability factor csf the four csf calculations are as follows ①product method 9 csf f v f h f c ②geometric mean method 10 csf f v f h f c 3 ③minimum method 11 csf min f v f h f c ④weighted average method 12 csf k v f v k h f h k c f c here csf is the combined suitability factor for each unit v h and c are the flow velocity index water depth index and channel index including substrate and cover respectively and kv kh and kc are the suitability index of flow velocity water depth and substrate respectively the habitat model calculates the flow velocity and water depth distribution corresponding to the different flows in each section according to the hydraulic model and combined with the determined habitat suitability index the weighted habitat area wua of the studied river reach can be obtained the formula used to calculate wua is as follows 13 wua csf v i h i c i a i where wua is the weighted usable area per unit length of the study reach m2 ai is the water area whose length is the effective section distance m2 4 results and discussion 4 1 study area langfang city is located in the northeast of the north china plain in the middle and lower reaches of the haihe river basin langfang city is located between the two major cities of beijing and tianjin and in the hinterland of the bohai rim and it enjoys the reputations of pearl of the beijing tianjin corridor and corridor connecting beijing and tianjin and the workshop around the bohai rim the average annual rainfall in langfang is 539 7 mm and the average annual water surface evaporation is 1033 6 mm rainfall is distributed unevenly throughout the year with precipitation concentrated in june to september in the flood season accounting for approximately 80 of the precipitation of the whole year langfang has a dense river network and 112 rivers with a basin area of more than 50 km2 the long river originates in daxing district beijing with a total length of 68 42 km and a drainage area of 577 94 km2 including 35 5 km in langfang 13 7 km in guangyang and 21 8 km in anci district and a drainage area of 322 km2 both sides of the long river are filled with artificial dams and the riverbed is wide and gentle the long river is a naturally formed river course historically the river course oscillated greatly and was curved the general situation of the long river basin is shown in fig 3 4 2 indicator species the long river is a first level tributary of the yongding river the distribution characteristics of the fish in the river basin are highly similar to those of the fish in the yongding river basin scholars have summarized and sampled the taxonomic data of the freshwater fishes in hebei province there are 36 species of fish in the yongding river abbott 1901 du 2019 in this paper the species list of indicative fish in the yongding river system was selected as the identification basis of indicative organisms in the long river basin by consulting materials expert consultation and on site investigation as shown in table 1 based on the analysis of the fish community composition and spatial distribution characteristics of the yongding river system pseudorasbora parva is determined to be a common fish in yongding river system meanwhile based on the survey results of residents and anglers around the long river it is determined that pseudorasbora parva is an indicator species in the long river in addition other non indigenous species such as abbottina rivularis and carassius auratus in the long river basin are less sensitive to changes in the river water level rhynchocypris lagowskii is a common indigenous fish in northern rivers and is sensitive to the river hydrology process however r lagowskii is mainly distributed in mountain rivers and should not be used as an indicator species for the study of the ecological flow in the long river reed is a kind of large clonal aquatic plant that is widely distributed in the continental and aquatic ecotone and it plays a controlling role of the structure and function of wetland ecosystem as a water loving plant reed likes to grow in marshes floodplains and shallow lakes reed has a strong vegetative propagation ability and often forms a single superior species community reed can also grow in upland habitats without water there are control gates and dams along the long river and a large area of riverside beach wetlands are formed along the river after field investigation and expert consultation the needs of waterbirds to nest and of the fish habitat are considered and the water quantity requirements for the growth of reeds are relatively high therefore reed is selected as the indicator plant to calculate the ecological water quantity of the long river 4 3 hydraulics simulation the phabsim hydraulic model simulation selects the section from beichang station to zhangdongwu station on the mainstream of the long river as the simulation object the representative section should be selected on a straight section of a river and the section should not be affected by the inflow of upstream and downstream tributaries that is there are no large tributaries at the same time the influence of bridge backwater and cascade backwater on the selected section should be avoided four sections of beichang station yongfeng station yuezhuang station and zhangdongwu station were selected as the representative sections of the long river in the research reach and the average distance between each section is approximately 4 6 km fig 4 the measured large section data representing the section including the river bottom elevation corresponding to different starting distances and the necessary correction data are the necessary conditions to support the model simulation in the selection of the calibration flow the measured hydrological data from beichang hydrological station and zhangdongwu hydrological station in the research reach of the long river were mainly taken into account three typical high medium and low flows were selected and the water level corresponding to the measured calibration flow of the section was input into the calibration data table of the model to ensure the accuracy of the flow setting this study is limited by the data conditions based on the requirement of the water level flow regression method for the historical hydrological data of each section length series the water depth simulation mainly adopts the method combining the manning formula method and the backwater surface calculation method by setting different flows the mansq program is used to obtain the water level corresponding to each flow of the representative section and the corresponding parameters are adjusted by referring to the measured correction values in the process of debugging it is difficult to simultaneously debug the simulated water level corresponding to the corrected flow of all the representative sections to be close to the measured water level this study first debugs the downstream section zhangdongwu station so that the simulated water depth can meet the results as close as possible to the measured water level then the wsp program is used as the initial value of the downstream section water level to simulate and debug the water level and acquire a more satisfactory result the setting of the flow should comprehensively consider the low water period high water period and level water period of the reach to cover the flow of each hydrological period as far as possible considering that there are many controlled gates and dams on the long river which affect the connectivity of the river it is not appropriate to use the average annual runoff 0 295 m3 s as the basis for setting the flow this study takes the flow in beichang station calculated by the hydraulic method as the representative flow 2 16 m3 s and other corresponding proportions of the flow as the reference flow a total of 20 flow conditions corresponding to different hydrological periods are set table 2 shows due to the lack of measured flow velocity data the water depth calculation method was used to simulate the flow velocity of each section and the average water depth data were used to estimate the flow velocity value of each measured point 4 4 ecological basic flow among the methods used to calculate the ecological water demand in many rivers the indicative species habitat simulation method is a quantitative analysis method based on the characteristics of biological water requirements this method is also the most accurate widely used and highly convincing ecological flow assessment method in the hydro habitat method the phabsim is widely used because it can quickly assess the physical habitat changes caused by changes in river flow the suitable ecological flows at the spawning stage breeding stage and growth stage recommended by the physical habitat simulation method are determined based on the habitat suitability conditions at each growth stage of pseudorasbora parva table 3 based on the demands of the watershed ecosystem itself this method can reflect the changes in water demand caused by biological and physiological changes the phabsim is a specific application of nbs and natural flow paradigm theory in ecological flow determination table 4 the flow corresponding to the turning point in the wet cycle flow process curve is the ecological flow within the watershed controlled by the section this study calculated ecological flows of beichang station yongfeng zha station yuezhuang station and zhangdongwu station in typical sections of the long river of 2 16 m3 s 4 35 m3 s 1 18 m3 s and 0 89 m3 s respectively and the corresponding river flow rates for each section were 0 20 m s 0 19 m s 0 19 m s and 0 18 m s respectively the ecological flow requirement of 10 8 m3 s in the growing period december to march is not consistent with the actual situation in the water period of the long river basin moreover adult pseudorasbora parva has a wide range of habitat suitability and low flow does not affect its survival and growth therefore based on the habitat of pseudorasbora parva the suitable ecological flow during its spawning and breeding periods determined by the simulation method is recommended as the ecological basic flow of the long river from april to november the ecological flow of the controlled section of the long river beichang station determined by the wetted perimeter method is recommended as the ecological basic flow of the long river from december to march therefore the basic ecological flow of the main stream of the long river is 3 14 m3 s from april to june 4 32 m3 s from july to november and 2 16 m3 s from december to march 4 5 ecological flow water quantity 4 5 1 ecological flow the ecological flow process of the long river is used to indicate the water demand of fish during their whole life cycle nbs take into account the water requirement of the riparian indicator vegetation reed this study describes the water requirement of the longhe river according to the pulse flow during the spawning period and the flood process during the flood season the specific ecological flow process is shown in fig 5 according to the lengths of the spawning period april to june the juvenile period july november and the growth period december march of pseudorasbora parva the ecological basic flows are respectively 3 24 m3 s 4 32 m3 s and 2 16 m3 s as the minimum flow requirement for each time period a pulse flow process with a peak flow of 11 31 m3 s for 7 days occurred at the end of spawning early july to stimulate fish spawning and ensure the necessary hydrological conditions for egg hatching combined with the upstream inflow of the long river during the flood season a small flood process with a peak flow of 24 95 m3 s and a duration of three days is guaranteed this process maintains the stability of the physical habitat and enhances material circulation in the main river channel and floodplain area flood pulse is the main driving force of the biological coexistence and productivity interaction between the river and flood area the process of lateral flooding and water level fluctuations in floodplains are important manifestations of the ecological significance of flood pulses in biological life activities dong zhang 2009 the pulse flow can provide the stimulation signal necessary for fish to spawn and can guide fish migration the pulse flow can also provide a suitable habitat for fish to spawn this study restores the maximum continuous 7 day 90 guarantee rate average flow of runoff as the lower limit of the monthly pulse flow in this study according to the physiological processes of pseudorasbora parva the pulse flow was selected at the end of spawning early july and d was taken for 7 days the flow value corresponding to the 75 guarantee rate 11 31 m3 s is taken as the lower limit to indicate the pulse flow during the spawning period compared with the suitable flow of 3 24 m3 s during the spawning period the minimum spawning pulse flow requirement could not be met therefore the flow pulse process requirement was put forward at the end of spawning period early july with a flow of 11 31 m3 s and a duration of 7 days according to the multi year runoff data of the long river basin the flood stage of the main stream is taken as the lower limit considering the water demand stimulated by fish spawning the recurrence period is taken as 2 years and a single small flood lasts for 3 days the timing of the small flood depends on the temperature adaptability of the indicator fish pseudorasbora parva in the river reach in the calculation process the average value of the maximum three day runoff in the flood process under a guarantee rate of 50 of the representative section is taken as the lower limit of the small flood peak flow the maximum one day discharge under a guarantee rate of 10 is taken as the target value of the peak discharge of the flood the maximum three day and maximum one day flows in each year 1977 2019 of the long river are selected to reduce the amount of calculations the peak value of a small flood was 24 95 m3 s and that of a large flood was 196 m3 s 4 5 2 ecological water quantity for the distribution of reed a certain amount of surface flooding is conducive to its survival the specific manifestation is the adaptability of the reed population to the wet biochemical habitat and the number of reeds will continue to increase during wet biochemical processes of the habitat moreover the more abundant water is the better the growth of reeds is once the surface is flooded or the soil is too wet reeds will become the dominant population this study analyses the growth status of each growth stage from reed germination to its maturity period and establishes the law of the water requirement change of reed plants with the growth time the upper and lower thresholds of the water level are set according to the water depth requirements of reed to determine its water requirements for growth in the study area based on the water resources bulletin and meteorological data of langfang city this study selects the meteorological data of langfang from 2005 to 2016 as the basis to calculate et 0 the suitable groundwater depth for the growth of reed is 0 4 2 0 m that is when the groundwater level is more than 2 m the soil moisture can basically meet the water requirements for the growth of reed liu et al 2008 su et al 2010 maria nurlan et al 2018 and 2 m is taken as the lower limit for the suitable underground water table for reed growth when the groundwater level exceeds 3 m soil moisture is deficient and vegetation begins to degenerate the roots of reeds are highly resistant to water absorption and evapotranspiration decreases significantly therefore 3 m is used as the lower limit of groundwater depth to ensure the basic water requirements for reed growth according to the relationship between groundwater depth and the average soil water content given in the literature the average soil water content was determined zheng et al 2005 when the depth of soil is 2 m and 3 m the corresponding soil water content is 24 6 and 20 5 respectively therefore 24 6 and 20 5 were taken as the suitable soil water content and the minimum soil water content respectively for the normal growth of reed the vegetation coefficient can reflect the biological characteristics of vegetation which is mainly affected by the length of the growth period and the leaf surface index of the vegetation community the limiting coefficient of soil moisture mainly reflects the influence of soil moisture on plant transpiration during the growing period of reed april november the ecological water requirements of vegetation were calculated according to the above method the ecological water requirements for reed in the long river basin are shown in fig 6 the typical river section of the long river basin beichang station zhangdongwu station meets the suitable annual water required for reed growth 19 800 m3 and has an annual minimum water volume of 15 100 m3 the suitable water depths for the initial growth stage development stage middle growth stage and later growth stage of reed are 0 2 m 0 4 m 0 5 m and 0 3 m respectively the available habitat area corresponding to each growth stage was calculated as 23 401 m2 46 802 m2 58 502 m2 and 35 101 m2 respectively to maintain the health of the river ecosystem based on the water requirements of the indicated vegetation in the riparian zone the ecological water requirements of each life cycle of reed was determined the life cycle of the vegetation was basically consistent with the growth stage of the indicated fish the appropriate ecological flow of pseudorasbora parva at each growth stage could meet the ecological water requirements of the indicated reed 4 6 habitat suitability curve channel substrates and mulch are usually not sensitive in flow related habitat analysis pseudorasbora parva has a wide range of water temperature suitability in river water and temperature change does not affect its survival jiang et al 2012 compared with flow velocity and water depth the effects of the channel index and water temperature can be ignored and their suitability are assigned as 1 through consulting the domestic and foreign literature hou et al 2019 combined with the research results of the suitability curve for carp and relying on expert consultation and field investigations the habitat suitability curve for pseudorasbora parva at different growth stages is generated and shown in fig 7 based on the hydrodynamic simulation results from the studied section of the long river with different flows the product method was used in this paper to calculate the suitable habitat area for pseudorasbora parva in the representative section the suitable habitat area of the river reach was obtained through arithmetical averaging as shown in fig 8 4 7 discussion the wua in various growth stages of pseudorasbora parva gradually increased with increasing flow and peaked at a certain flow then the wua decreased with increasing flow and the decreasing trend gradually decreased during the spawning period of pseudorasbora parva wua showed a significant turning point at 3 24 m3 s and then its growth became slow reaching a peak of 11 326 m2 at 21 6 m3 s after that wua gradually decreased and finally stabilized during the breeding period wua showed a significant turning point at 4 32 m3 s which slowly increased to a peak of 14 557 m2 at 32 4 m3 s and then gradually decreased to a stable level in the growth stage the turning point of wua was significantly delayed with the increase of flow appearing at 10 8 m3 s then increased slowly reaching a peak value of 20 809 m2 at 216 m3 s and finally gradually decreased under the condition of low flow the wua in the growth stage of pseudorasbora parva is smaller than that in the spawning stage and the breeding stage while the wua in the growth stage of pseudorasbora parva under the condition of high flow is larger than in the other two life stages fig 6 in the growth stage p parva prefers a deep water environment the optimum water depth is 0 5 2 0 m but p parva is also distributed in shallow water under the condition of high flow the wua of each growth stage was ranked as follows the growth stage was the largest the breeding stage was the second largest and the spawning stage was the smallest the suitable water depth and flow velocity conditions in the growth period of pseudorasbora parva have a wider range so only adult pseudorasbora parva can survive in a high flow environment and fish eggs and juveniles are mainly distributed in shallow water the peak value of wua at each growth stage corresponds to the flow at the growth stage at the breeding stage at the spawning stage which is consistent with the suitable habitat conditions at each growth stage based on the simulation results of the wua changing in each growth stage with the discharge the suitable flow range of the target fish in the long river was analysed the ecological flow was determined according to the suitable flow of the target fish pseudorasbora parva at each growth stage in practice when larger rivers or target species have excessively high requirements for river habitat factors the flow corresponding to the maximum wua is regarded as the ecological flow this method does not meet the requirements of river passage research nor does it meet the requirements of maintaining river health furthermore in the actual environment of the study river many biological resources that need to be protected therefore in general the ecological flow calculated from the habitat suitability curve selected by only one biological species will be too large therefore it is difficult to achieve the maximum value of the theoretical calculation in the actual operation of ecological flow even under natural conditions the maximum wua corresponding to the flow is difficult to ensure therefore the flow corresponding to the obvious turning point on the flow wua curve is selected as the ecological flow the long river basin belongs to a small river with a low width depth index the value of the wua at the turning point of the flow wua curve is the optimal value for the growth of the target fish in the studied river reach when there was an obvious turning point in the flow wua curve during the spawning period the corresponding flow q was 3 24 m3 s and the wua of the target fish was 9773 m2 when there was an obvious turning point in the flow wua curve during the breeding period the corresponding flow q was 4 32 m3 s and the habitat suitability area wua of the target fish was 13 270 m2 when there was an obvious turning point in the flow wua curve during the growth period the corresponding flow q was 10 8 m3 s and the habitat suitability area wua of the target fish was 14 589 m2 taking this flow as the target value of the ecological flow in different periods of the long river it can guarantee the living environment of pseudorasbora parva in the river to the greatest extent and meet the ecological flow demand in each growth stage during the growth period of reed the growth condition of reed was closely related to the change of water depth zefan yang 2015 believed that reed could maintain suitable growth in the range of 0 2 1 m water depth and that the optimal water depth range was 0 3 0 5 m chunnuan deng et al 2012 in the analysis of the physiological and ecological law of reed according to the water depth gradient concluded that a water depth of 0 15 m was the minimum ecological water level of reed and a water depth of 0 35 0 45 m could ensure the optimal growth state of reed and was the most suitable ecological water level for reed growth poorter et al 2012 thought that the ecological adaptability of the reed population to the change of water depth gradient was not linear an excessively high water depth 50 cm 150 cm or a too low water depth 0 5 cm had a certain inhibitory effect on the growth of reed the coupling degree between reed plant height and biomass in the suitable water depth interval 5 50 cm was high and reed grew well changming li et al 2015 measured the water depth range and growth characteristics of the distribution of solitary and coexisting reeds and cattail and found that reeds were mainly distributed in shallow water and at a medium water depth 0 50 cm when the water depth was 20 30 cm solitary reeds grew well with the increase of water depth the number of leaves stem diameter plant height and density of solitary reeds first increased and then decreased therefore the suitable water depth in the growing period of reed was 0 2 0 5 m that is when the water depth is less than 0 2 m or more than 0 5 m the growth of reed will be inhibited ecological flow is one of the indicators in river protection and restoration practice at present many studies have estimated the ecological flow of rivers in northern china bao et al 2012 xia et al 2012 huang et al 2014 it would be reasonable to set 30 or more of the natural inflow as the recommended ecological flow of rivers for river ecosystem restoration the minimum ecological flow threshold standard to 31 of annual average flow wu and chen 2018 by selecting the maximum value between the total economic value of the ecological and economic services functions of rivers system the ecological base flow of rivers is 35 02 of the natural runoff in baoji section of weihe river and the long river is 26 cheng et al 2019 in the ertix river the 79 of the annual mean flow was recommended as the ecological flow in the fish breeding period which is in the optimal range of ecological flow shang 2015 the ecological flow is about 50 of the annual mean flow in breeding period of pseudorasbora parva the calculation results in the manuscript were very close to that of cheng et al 2019 and shang 2015 and it provided better aquatic habitat and prevent long river from ecological degradation and achieve river health 5 conclusion in an actual situation it is difficult to realize complete river restoration to an undisturbed naturalized state therefore based on the concept of nbs referring to the natural flow paradigm theory and proceeding from the appeals of the watershed ecosystem itself research on the ecological flow of rivers based on the concept of nature is carried out the processes for restoring both the natural state of rivers and their ecological flows to the maximum extent are studied in this paper pseudorasbora parva and reed are selected as the indicator species and the ecological water demand processes of smelt and riparian reed in the long river basin are calculated by means of the habitat simulation method and the penman monteith formula furthermore the phabsim model is used to simulate the relationship between the change of the flow and the indication of the fish habitat area taking into account the adaptability of the target species to the habitat flow velocity water depth substrate and river cover and the sizes of the ecological flow of pseudorasbora parva in the spawning period april june breeding period july november and growing period december march were determined to be 3 14 m3 s 4 32 m3 s and 2 16 m3 s respectively using the hydrology method of reducing the measured runoff process based on the natural flow process and the water demand process stimulated by fish spawning the pulse flow and flood processes in the spawning period of pseudorasbora parva were calculated a 7 day 90 guarantee rate pulse flow process with a peak flow of 11 31 m3 s and a three day minor flood process with a peak flow of 24 95 m3 s that occurs at the end of spawning period are proposed this study calculated that the suitable ecological flow in each growth stage could meet the ecological water demand of reed at the same period the determination of the ecological flow is an important basis for strengthening the integrated management of water resource development and utilization and for realizing the healthy development of a watershed water ecosystem the manuscript proposed a nested calculation framework for ecological flow of rivers considering the ecological integrity biological diversity morphological diversity and ecological service functions at the watershed scale based on nbs this method is an important basis for quantitative calculation of ecological water demands which can provide a practical and useful evaluation approach for the determination of the watershed health therefore this method is an important basis for characterizing the diversified ecological value and biodiversity and can provide a new idea for technical processes and the implementation of safeguard measures in the determination of ecological flow with the optimization of

4517,the current difficulties in determining the ecological flow of rivers in northern china are the poor pertinence of methods and insufficient consideration of ecological factors on the basis of systematic analysis of river hydrological situations and ecological protection objectives the existing water ecological problems in river reaches were identified a nested calculation framework for ecological flow of rivers was given based on nature based solutions nbs considering the ecological integrity biological diversity morphological diversity and ecological service functions with help of physical habitat simulation and the penman monteith formula indicator species were selected to research the natural process of restoring river function and realizing river runoff to meet the water requirements of riparian vegetation during the growth period of the indicated species the water demand law of typical vegetation changing with the growth time was studied the upper and lower water levels were set and the ecological water requirements of vegetation at each growth stage were determined the results showed that the ecological basic flows required for the spawning period april june the juvenile period july november and the growth period december march of pseudorasbora parva in the long river typical section were 3 14 m3 s 4 32 m3 s and 2 16 m3 s respectively at the end of the spawning period a 7 day 90 guarantee rate pulse flow with a peak flow of 11 31 m3 s a small flood process with a peak flow of 24 95 m3 s and a small flood process in the flood season lasting for 3 days provided effective external stimulation for the spawning of pseudorasbora parva the minimum annual ecological water requirement of reed was 15 100 m3 the current ecological flow of the long river can meet the water requirements of most aquatic organisms and plants in the river ecosystem the ecological flow calculation method based on nbs is widely applicable and the results are representative the method can be used to calculate the ecological flow of small and medium sized northern rivers with a small flow and low flow rate keywords ecological flow nature based solutions ecological water requirements indicator species physical habitat simulation quantitative analysis 1 introduction at present most river ecosystems are facing human induced disturbances such as water depletion water pollution landscape change overutilization of biological resources and changes in hydrological conditions and natural disturbances such as floods droughts and soil erosion he et al 2008 the river ecosystem has begun to show signs of degradation in terms of species composition community structure and ecological function chen tao 2015 the concept of ecological flow was put forward to curb the degradation of river ecosystems caused by excessive water use there is no uniform standard for the definition of ecological flow the main international terms related to ecological flow imply a certain amount of water maintained or discharged in an aquatic ecosystem to achieve a specific goal of the ecosystem which takes into account both the needs of ecosystem health and economic and social development at present research on ecological flow has gone through three stages theoretical germination popularization and expansion and hydro ecological perspective development the theoretical embryonic stage refers to the late 1940s 1960s which is mainly based on practical experience to determine ecological flow there is no systematic calculation method for this stage dong et al 2017 the popularization and expansion stage refers to the early 1970s to the late 1990s when researchers extended and refined the connotation of ecological flow the most important research achievements in this stage are reflected in the development of various calculation methods namely the hydrology method hydro habitat method and integral method tennant 1976 armour taylor 1991 petts 1996 gleick 1998 crawford 2000 a variety of ecological flow calculation methods are used synthetically which greatly improves the application of ecological flow measures in china ma et al 2018 in the 21st century the development of ecological flow has entered the stage of the hydro ecological perspective based on the ecological significance of undisturbed natural flow and its important role in supporting the biodiversity of river ecosystems poff et al 1997 proposed the theory of nature flow paradigm nfp which was the first time the theory of ecological flow based on the relationship between hydro ecological change and ecological response was studied the calculation method of ecological flow based on specific ecological protection targets has also been developed and the research theories and calculation methods such as sustainable boundaries the development space concept and the ecological limits of hydrologic alteration eloha have promoted the development of ecological flow from the hydro ecological perspective postel richtre 2002 king brown 2010 poff et al 2010 the eloha framework does not prescribe a specific hydrological assessment tool or scientifically calculation method to quantifying ecological flow poff et al 2010 the calculation methods don t fully consider factors such as river topography meandering river lake relationship physical and chemical characteristics of water bodies material flow information flow species flow the calculation results can only meet the ecological requirements of the indicated species but not necessarily the needs of the water ecosystem in the basin people are working to solve the impact of human activities on the river ecosystem and have realized the value of nature itself so it is urgent to manage and maintain the value of ecosystem services scholars have proposed the concept of nature based solutions nbs to try to provide new ideas for solving the problem of traditional engineering interventions that cannot achieve the dual goals of economic growth and sustainability fu et al 2018a zhang et al 2019 it is becoming increasingly important to carry out relevant research focusing on the restoration of river habitats and a series of studies on the watershed scale based on ecological information management river health assessment ecological planning and the response mechanism of various disturbance factors and ecological factors have been performed fu et al 2018b this paper is structured as follows 1 introduction elaborating on the background and theoretical significance of the research subject in this paper 2 theory study with subsections on the 1 nbs which is based on diversified ecosystems and sustainable development and 2 ecological flow which is based on biological needs and natural flow

empirical formula and statistics software and 3 supply the plot of the habitat suitability curve 4 results and discussion and 54 conclusions an integrated system was proposed to calculate ecological flow based on nbs watershed water resources and water consumption fig 1 there is an urgent need to carry out measurements of river ecological flow water quantity based on nbs in the framework of ecological natural harmonious development aiming at developing a method to calculate the ecological flow and its applicable scope with the restoration of water flow naturalization as the core 2 theory study 2 1 nbs nbs emphasize the contribution of well managed and diversified ecosystems to improving human resilience and sustainable development focusing on the enhancement of ecosystem services except for two scientific introductions the term nbs mainly appears in policy documents and it has not been widely used in the scientific literature until recently eggermont et al 2015 kabisch et al 2016 maes and jacobs 2017 the international union for conservation of nature defines nbs as the behaviour of protecting sustainably managing and restoring nature or improving an ecosystem so that it can effectively adapt to local conditions to meet social challenges and at the same time these behaviours can provide human welfare and produce biodiversity benefits the european commission 2011 defines nbs as a method to address social challenges inspired and supported by nature this method is cost effective can provide environmental social and economic benefits and helps to improve the resilience of ecosystems nbs can provide a variety of water related solutions which can help solve many problems such as water quantity water quality and wading risk management nbs mainly solve the problem of water supply by managing the processes of precipitation water storage infiltration and transmission thus improving the spatial distribution and time allocation of water resources available for human use the potential power of nature can provide solutions to global challenges in the fields of climate change food security social and economic development etc eggermont et al 2015 healthy diversified and well managed water ecosystems can provide a basis for solving practical problems of the water environment based on the concept of nature environmental social and economic challenges are transformed into an innovative mechanism of multiple dynamic coupling with the help of natural forces and complex logical reasoning to create a sustainable and multifunctional basin water ecosystem and landscape that can be used to improve the service value of the basin ecosystem and realize good water ecological health of the basin 2 2 ecological flow the natural hydrological process has a natural rationality the biological geomorphic physical and chemical processes of rivers are highly dependent on natural hydrological processes although the abiotic processes of rivers have changed to varying degrees due to the interference of human activities organisms also show many reactions such as active escape passive patience and active adaptation however considering the preference for specific water flow conditions that formed during the evolution of organisms over tens of thousands or even hundreds of millions of years natural water flow is still an ideal hydrological situation for most organisms at present it is impossible to completely restore the river flow process to the undisturbed natural state because the large scale water intake by humans and the regulation of reservoir runoff not only change the river natural runoff process but also affect the river hydrological situation based on nbs it is of great significance to determine the ecological flow with the natural hydrological situation as a benchmark for protecting most organisms and maintaining the integrity of the river ecosystem under the condition that river function cannot be completely restored to natural conditions partial restoration of the natural runoff process will be beneficial for improving the river water environment and maintaining a healthy habitat the determination of ecological flow based on nbs is based on the requirement of the watershed ecosystem itself which is convenient to reflect the change of the water requirements caused by natural changes and biophysical changes ten et al 2012 dudley et al 2010 in this paper based on nbs indicator species were selected and the penman monteith formula method based on a habitat simulation of indicator fish and the water requirement process of vegetation was adopted to determine the ecological flow quantity of the long river which is regarded as having an approximate natural flow state the flow process in this state can ensure the change of the water demand of the indicator fish and typical vegetation in the riparian zone 3 method analysis 3 1 selection of indicator species in the process of determining the ecological flow of the long river how to select a suitable target species and construct a suitability curve of this species to the flow process are very important the biological conditions in the study area combined with the ecological flow are used to select representative indicator species the target species commonly used internationally to determine ecological flow are salmon and sturgeon which are generally not applicable to rivers in north china the four major chinese carps mylopharyngodon piceus ctenopharynodon idellus hypophthalmichthys molitrix and aristichthys nobilis which are widely used in the study of determining the ecological flow limit in china are of little significance for determining the ecological restoration of rivers in north china because their populations in the rivers of north china are not large or are evenly distributed wang et al 2019 the selection of typical indigenous dominant fishes as indicator aquatic organisms can protect the river ecology in the region to the greatest extent and guide the development of regional ecological flow work the distribution and quantity of aquatic plants are closely related to changes in habitats the amount of water determines the structural changes of the plant community and the succession direction of the community to a certain extent aquatic vegetation will adapt to changes caused by changes in water conditions different vegetation communities may have different succession processes or results due to their different response intensities and sensitivities to water changes zhang et al 2020 in the process of determining the ecological flow of a river riparian vegetation is selected as the indicator species which can fully characterize the horizontal connectivity function of the river as riparian vegetation is mainly affected by floodplain flow it has a certain reference value for determining the sensitive ecological flow however the vegetation coverage rate of the riparian zone of some rivers with large artificial disturbances is relatively low yue et al 2019 therefore selecting dominant populations with strong vitality and obvious water demand characteristics as indicator species is an effective means to guide the formulation of ecological flows 3 2 calculation of ecological flow the complexity of the physical habitat has an important impact on the species richness of biological communities generally speaking the complexity of a physical habitat is positively correlated with the richness of the biological communities and species diversity in the habitat a suitable habitat area of a river is affected by factors such as flow velocity water depth distribution river matrix and water surface coverage the living habits and life cycle activities of indicator fish are strongly disturbed by changes in hydrological conditions therefore this work is based on nbs and the use of the habitat simulation method has important ecological value for studying the ecological flow of indicator fish many ecological flow determination methods use natural water flow as a reference such as the tennant method and eloha framework the representative ecological flow determination methods that directly apply the natural flow paradigm are the natural flow sensitive period simulation method and the variability range method this paper uses the phabsim physical habitat simulation system hydraulic model to estimate the water depth and flow velocity of each sub section of the study area which provides a hydraulic foundation for the determination of the suitable habitat area the phabsim model believes that there is a suitability relationship between the life history traits of aquatic species and hydraulic conditions the habitat needs of organisms at different life history stages can be evaluated according to hydraulic condition variables preference for certain types of hydraulic conditions can be expressed by the habitat suitability index organisms can choose hydraulic conditions at different stages of their life history to deal with the impact of environmental changes wang et al 2018 select representative sections of this study determine and obtain the river bottom elevation data of each section through on site measurements including the measurement of at least 3 corrected flows at the control hydrological station and the water depth and velocity corresponding to the corrected flows the phabsim model is established on the basis of the relative distance between the various sections the large section data the corrected water level and the flow velocity and a simulation is carried out with the help of a one dimensional hydraulic formula 3 2 1 simulate water depth in the phabsim model the water depth of each district can be determined by the difference between the water level elevation and the river bottom elevation this paper uses the stgq log log regression mansq channel conveyance and wsp step backwater procedures included in the phabsim model to estimate the water level corresponding to the different flows of each river section the stgq method also called the logarithmic logarithmic regression method is a water level and flow regression method the stgq method uses historical hydrological data of each section of the river to derive the parameters a and b of the water level and flow regression equation respectively in the stgq program to calculate the different flows of river sections the equation is 1 w s l s z f a q b where wsl is the water level elevation m szf is the section water level m q is the flow rate m3 s a is a constant related to the flow rate and the measured value of the water level and b is the measured value coefficient of the flow rate and the water level the mansq method also called the channel transportation method is a water level flow simulation method based on the manning formula using the flow and water depth data of the river sections the roughness manning n value of each section is calculated and the manning formula is substituted to estimate the water depth corresponding to the change in flow since the water passing area a and hydraulic radius r of the section are both functions of the water depth d the formula for a uniform water body is as follows 2 q 1 n g d where g d is the functional relationship that changes with the section shape and the slope of the riverbed the wsp method is also called the step push backwater method the wsp method uses the gradual flow surface line equation to calculate the water depth of each upstream section one by one from a downstream initial section with the standard step method this method has higher requirements for the water depth of the downstream section 3 2 2 velocity simulation the currently used velocity calculation method has very high requirements for the measured water depth and velocity value data the most representative measured velocity value is input into the phabsim model to calculate the manning n value and the velocity value under other flow conditions can be calculated the manning n value is very important for selecting the representative flow rate which may affect the final result and can be verified based on the actual measured calibration flow the speed regression calculation method uses the autoregressive equation to calculate using this method requires at least two sets of measured data for regression analysis when the application conditions are not met the phabsim model will automatically use the known speed calculation method for calculation the formula for the speed regression calculation method is 3 v α q γ where α and γ are undetermined coefficients q is the flow rate m3 s and v is the flow velocity m s the water depth calculation method expresses the flow velocity as a function of water depth the function relationship is determined by the characteristics of the section the velocity of each zone is calculated by manning s formula the equation is 4 v 1 n f d where n is the roughness d is the water depth m the water depth calculation method is widely used for estimating the cross section flow velocity when there are no measured velocity data the phabsim model provides a velocity adjustment factor vaf to effectively evaluate the flow velocity error calculated by the water depth calculation method to complete the correction work 3 3 calculation of ecological water quantity the factors that affect the determination of the vegetation ecological water demand mainly include climatic factors soil moisture and differences in vegetation types the basic physiological water demand of plants only accounts for a small part of the total water demand of plants which can be ignored the actual water demand of plants is regarded as the ecological water demand of vegetation vegetation evapotranspiration is mainly determined by the vegetation types and meteorological conditions in the study area the vegetation coefficient can reflect the biological characteristics of the vegetation itself and is mainly affected by factors such as the length of the growth period and the leaf surface index of the vegetation community the soil moisture limitation coefficient mainly reflects the influence of soil moisture status on plant transpiration there is a correlation between ecological water demand and ecological water consumption and the degree of satisfaction of the ecological water demand determines the health of the ecosystem the ecological water consumption of vegetation is the water consumption of evapotranspiration for river wetland vegetation the satisfaction degree of vegetation water demand can be reflected by the difference between the actual evapotranspiration and the vegetation water demand corresponding to the vegetation growth conditions to calculate plant evapotranspiration the improved penman monteith formula method paredes et al 2020 is usually used the calculation equation is 5 e t c k c k s e t 0 w p e t c a p 1000 where etc is the vegetation ecological water requirement mm et0 is the indicator vegetation evapotranspiration mm kc is the vegetation coefficient ks is the soil moisture limit coefficient wp is the vegetation ecological water requirement m3 and ap is the vegetation distribution area m2 the improved penman formula method is used to calculate the actual water demand of plants by calculating the potential evapotranspiration of plants the calculation formula used to determine the potential evapotranspiration of vegetation is that recommended by the fao mccoll 2020 6 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 e s e a t 273 δ γ i 0 34 u 2 where rn is the net radiation on the surface of the canopy mj m2 d g is the soil heat flux mj m2 d t is the average temperature es is the saturated vapour pressure kpa ea is the actual water vapour pressure kpa is the tangent slope of the relationship between the saturated water vapour pressure and air temperature at t kpa γ is the hygrometer constant kpa and u2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s 3 3 1 the determination of kc to reflect the biological characteristics of the vegetation itself the determination of kc is affected by factors such as the length of the vegetation growth period and the leaf surface index this study uses the piecewise single value average crop coefficient method proposed by the united nations food and agriculture organization fao to determine kc generalizes the change process of the vegetation coefficient into four stages early growth development mid growth and late growth and uses the average value of this period as the crop coefficient of this stage allen et al 1998 reed is taken as an example ① in the early growth period 4 5 months the vegetation coverage rate is from germination to nearly 10 the vegetation coefficient at this stage is kc ini during the development period june july the vegetation coverage rate ranges from 10 to effective full coverage and the vegetation coefficient increases from kc ini to kc mid at this stage in the mid growth period august to september the vegetation gradually matures the signs of maturity are yellow leaves and fallen leaves the vegetation coefficient at this stage is kc mid in the late growth period october november from vegetation maturity to senescence the sign of senescence is that the vegetation naturally becomes dry or dead leaves are lost the vegetation coefficient at this stage is kc end in the process of determining kc it is necessary to take the average value of the upper and lower thresholds of the vegetation coefficient during the development and later stages of growth the vegetation coefficient kc ini at the initial stage of growth depends on the time interval of soil moisture in the study area the degree of soil moisture and the ability of the soil moisture to undergo atmospheric evaporation this study refers to the method used to determine the land vegetation coefficient that is the humid time interval is expressed as the ratio of the total number of days in the initial growth period to the number of rainfalls during the period kc ini is determined by

wither withering coefficient m3 m3 3 4 plot of the habitat suitability curve the habitat suitability curve hsc of fish was plotted according to the habitat suitability standard of the indicator fish to determine the habitat suitability criteria first the indicator species should be selected in the study area and their habitat characteristics should be determined by means of a life habit and environmental investigation the habitat suitability index should be correlated with the impact factors of the target species habitat where the suitable and restricted conditions are assigned to 1 and 0 respectively the determination of the habitat suitability criteria is the biological basis of the habitat simulation method and its authenticity and accuracy determine the success of the habitat simulation ying 2006 flow velocity water depth substrate and cover are the main environmental factors that affect species number and distribution a habitat model simulation is based on three basic assumptions there is a quantitative relationship between habitat suitability and the flow of the simulated target fish the habitat factors such as flow velocity and water depth affect the quantity and distribution of the target fish species and the riverbed conditions are stable during the model simulation and do not change with the flow rate according to the habitat suitability curve of the fish and the simulation results of the flow rate and water depth in each section of the channel cross section the model can combine the suitability factors of different habitat factors to obtain the combined suitability factor csf the four csf calculations are as follows ①product method 9 csf f v f h f c ②geometric mean method 10 csf f v f h f c 3 ③minimum method 11 csf min f v f h f c ④weighted

corresponding to the different flows in each section according to the hydraulic model and combined with the determined habitat suitability index the weighted habitat area wua of the studied river

length is the effective section distance m2 4 results and discussion 4 1 study area langfang city is located in the northeast of the north china plain in the middle and lower reaches of the haihe river basin langfang city is located between the two major cities of beijing and tianjin and in the hinterland of the bohai rim and it enjoys the reputations of pearl of the beijing tianjin corridor and corridor connecting beijing and tianjin and the workshop around the bohai rim the average annual rainfall in langfang is 539 7 mm and the average annual water surface evaporation is 1033 6 mm rainfall is distributed unevenly throughout the year with precipitation concentrated in june to september in the flood season accounting for approximately 80 of the precipitation of the whole year langfang has a dense river network and 112 rivers with a basin area of more than 50 km2 the long river originates in daxing district beijing with a total length of 68 42 km and a drainage area of 577 94 km2 including 35 5 km in langfang 13 7 km in guangyang and 21 8 km in anci district and a drainage area of 322 km2 both sides of the long river are filled with artificial dams and the riverbed is wide and gentle the long river is a naturally formed river course historically the river course oscillated greatly and was curved the general situation of the long river basin is shown in fig 3 4 2 indicator species the long river is a first level tributary of the yongding river the distribution characteristics of the fish in the river basin are highly similar to those of the fish in the yongding river basin scholars have summarized and sampled the taxonomic data of the freshwater fishes in hebei province there are 36 species of fish in the yongding river abbott 1901 du 2019 in this paper the species list of indicative fish in the yongding river system was selected as the identification basis of indicative organisms in the long river basin by consulting materials expert consultation and on site investigation as shown in table 1 based on the analysis of the fish community composition and spatial distribution characteristics of the yongding river system pseudorasbora parva is determined to be a common fish in yongding river system meanwhile based on the survey results of residents and anglers around the long river it is determined that pseudorasbora parva is an indicator species in the long river in addition other non indigenous species such as abbottina rivularis and carassius auratus in the long river basin are less sensitive to changes in the river water level rhynchocypris lagowskii is a common indigenous fish in northern rivers and is sensitive to the river hydrology process however r lagowskii is mainly distributed in mountain rivers and should not be used as an indicator species for the study of the ecological flow in the long river reed is a kind of large clonal aquatic plant that is widely distributed in the continental and aquatic ecotone and it plays a controlling role of the structure and function of wetland ecosystem as a water loving plant reed likes to grow in marshes floodplains and shallow lakes reed has a strong vegetative propagation ability and often forms a single superior species community reed can also grow in upland habitats without water there are control gates and dams along the long river and a large area of riverside beach wetlands are formed along the river after field investigation and expert consultation the needs of waterbirds to nest and of the fish habitat are considered and the water quantity requirements for the growth of reeds are relatively high therefore reed is selected as the indicator plant to calculate the ecological water quantity of the long river 4 3 hydraulics simulation the phabsim hydraulic model simulation selects the section from beichang station to zhangdongwu station on the mainstream of the long river as the simulation object the representative section should be selected on a straight section of a river and the section should not be affected by the inflow of upstream and downstream tributaries that is there are no large tributaries at the same time the influence of bridge backwater and cascade backwater on the selected section should be avoided four sections of beichang station yongfeng station yuezhuang station and zhangdongwu station were selected as the representative sections of the long river in the research reach and the average distance between each section is approximately 4 6 km fig 4 the measured large section data representing the section including the river bottom elevation corresponding to different starting distances and the necessary correction data are the necessary conditions to support the model simulation in the selection of the calibration flow the measured hydrological data from beichang hydrological station and zhangdongwu hydrological station in the research reach of the long river were mainly taken into account three typical high medium and low flows were selected and the water level corresponding to the measured calibration flow of the section was input into the calibration data table of the model to ensure the accuracy of the flow setting this study is limited by the data conditions based on the requirement of the water level flow regression method for the historical hydrological data of each section length series the water depth simulation mainly adopts the method combining the manning formula method and the backwater surface calculation method by setting different flows the mansq program is used to obtain the water level corresponding to each flow of the representative section and the corresponding parameters are adjusted by referring to the measured correction values in the process of debugging it is difficult to simultaneously debug the simulated water level corresponding to the corrected flow of all the representative sections to be close to the measured water level this study first debugs the downstream section zhangdongwu station so that the simulated water depth can meet the results as close as possible to the measured water level then the wsp program is used as the initial value of the downstream section water level to simulate and debug the water level and acquire a more satisfactory result the setting of the flow should comprehensively consider the low water period high water period and level water period of the reach to cover the flow of each hydrological period as far as possible considering that there are many controlled gates and dams on the long river which affect the connectivity of the river it is not appropriate to use the average annual runoff 0 295 m3 s as the basis for setting the flow this study takes the flow in beichang station calculated by the hydraulic method as the representative flow 2 16 m3 s and other corresponding proportions of the flow as the reference flow a total of 20 flow conditions corresponding to different hydrological periods are set table 2 shows due to the lack of measured flow velocity data the water depth calculation method was used to simulate the flow velocity of each section and the average water depth data were used to estimate the flow velocity value of each measured point 4 4 ecological basic flow among the methods used to calculate the ecological water demand in many rivers the indicative species habitat simulation method is a quantitative analysis method based on the characteristics of biological water requirements this method is also the most accurate widely used and highly convincing ecological flow assessment method in the hydro habitat method the phabsim is widely used because it can quickly assess the physical habitat changes caused by changes in river flow the suitable ecological flows at the spawning stage breeding stage and growth stage recommended by the physical habitat simulation method are determined based on the habitat suitability conditions at each growth stage of pseudorasbora parva table 3 based on the demands of the watershed ecosystem itself this method can reflect the changes in water demand caused by biological and physiological changes the phabsim is a specific application of nbs and natural flow paradigm theory in ecological flow determination table 4 the flow corresponding to the turning point in the wet cycle flow process curve is the ecological flow within the watershed controlled by the section this study calculated ecological flows of beichang station yongfeng zha station yuezhuang station and zhangdongwu station in typical sections of the long river of 2 16 m3 s 4 35 m3 s 1 18 m3 s and 0 89 m3 s respectively and the corresponding river flow rates for each section were 0 20 m s 0 19 m s 0 19 m s and 0 18 m s respectively the ecological flow requirement of 10 8 m3 s in the growing period december to march is not consistent with the actual situation in the water period of the long river basin moreover adult pseudorasbora parva has a wide range of habitat suitability and low flow does not affect its survival and growth therefore based on the habitat of pseudorasbora parva the suitable ecological flow during its spawning and breeding periods determined by the simulation method is recommended as the ecological basic flow of the long river from april to november the ecological flow of the controlled section of the long river beichang station determined by the wetted perimeter method is recommended as the ecological basic flow of the long river from december to march therefore the basic ecological flow of the main stream of the long river is 3 14 m3 s from april to june 4 32 m3 s from july to november and 2 16 m3 s from december to march 4 5 ecological flow water quantity 4 5 1 ecological flow the ecological flow process of the long river is used to indicate the water demand of fish during their whole life cycle nbs take into account the water requirement of the riparian indicator vegetation reed this study describes the water requirement of the longhe river according to the pulse flow during the spawning period and the flood process during the flood season the specific ecological flow process is shown in fig 5 according to the lengths of the spawning period april to june the juvenile period july november and the growth period december march of pseudorasbora parva the ecological basic flows are respectively 3 24 m3 s 4 32 m3 s and 2 16 m3 s as the minimum flow requirement for each time period a pulse flow process with a peak flow of 11 31 m3 s for 7 days occurred at the end of spawning early july to stimulate fish spawning and ensure the necessary hydrological conditions for egg hatching combined with the upstream inflow of the long river during the flood season a small flood process with a peak flow of 24 95 m3 s and a duration of three days is guaranteed this process maintains the stability of the physical habitat and enhances material circulation in the main river channel and floodplain area flood pulse is the main driving force of the biological coexistence and productivity interaction between the river and flood area the process of lateral flooding and water level fluctuations in floodplains are important manifestations of the ecological significance of flood pulses in biological life activities dong zhang 2009 the pulse flow can provide the stimulation signal necessary for fish to spawn and can guide fish migration the pulse flow can also provide a suitable habitat for fish to spawn this study restores the maximum continuous 7 day 90 guarantee rate average flow of runoff as the lower limit of the monthly pulse flow in this study according to the physiological processes of pseudorasbora parva the pulse flow was selected at the end of spawning early july and d was taken for 7 days the flow value corresponding to the 75 guarantee rate 11 31 m3 s is taken as the lower limit to indicate the pulse flow during the spawning period compared with the suitable flow of 3 24 m3 s during the spawning period the minimum spawning pulse flow requirement could not be met therefore the flow pulse process requirement was put forward at the end of spawning period early july with a flow of 11 31 m3 s and a duration of 7 days according to the multi year runoff data of the long river basin the flood stage of the main stream is taken as the lower limit considering the water demand stimulated by fish spawning the recurrence period is taken as 2 years and a single small flood lasts for 3 days the timing of the small flood depends on the temperature adaptability of the indicator fish pseudorasbora parva in the river reach in the calculation process the average value of the maximum three day runoff in the flood process under a guarantee rate of 50 of the representative section is taken as the lower limit of the small flood peak flow the maximum one day discharge under a guarantee rate of 10 is taken as the target value of the peak discharge of the flood the maximum three day and maximum one day flows in each year 1977 2019 of the long river are selected to reduce the amount of calculations the peak value of a small flood was 24 95 m3 s and that of a large flood was 196 m3 s 4 5 2 ecological water quantity for the distribution of reed a certain amount of surface flooding is conducive to its survival the specific manifestation is the adaptability of the reed population to the wet biochemical habitat and the number of reeds will continue to increase during wet biochemical processes of the habitat moreover the more abundant water is the better the growth of reeds is once the surface is flooded or the soil is too wet reeds will become the dominant population this study analyses the growth status of each growth stage from reed germination to its maturity period and establishes the law of the water requirement change of reed plants with the growth time the upper and lower thresholds of the water level are set according to the water depth requirements of reed to determine its water requirements for growth in the study area based on the water resources bulletin and meteorological data of langfang city this study selects the meteorological data of langfang from 2005 to 2016 as the basis to calculate et 0 the suitable groundwater depth for the growth of reed is 0 4 2 0 m that is when the groundwater level is more than 2 m the soil moisture can basically meet the water requirements for the growth of reed liu et al 2008 su et al 2010 maria nurlan et al 2018 and 2 m is taken as the lower limit for the suitable underground water table for reed growth when the groundwater level exceeds 3 m soil moisture is deficient and vegetation begins to degenerate the roots of reeds are highly resistant to water absorption and evapotranspiration decreases significantly therefore 3 m is used as the lower limit of groundwater depth to ensure the basic water requirements for reed growth according to the relationship between groundwater depth and the average soil water content given in the literature the average soil water content was determined zheng et al 2005 when the depth of soil is 2 m and 3 m the corresponding soil water content is 24 6 and 20 5 respectively therefore 24 6 and 20 5 were taken as the suitable soil water content and the minimum soil water content respectively for the normal growth of reed the vegetation coefficient can reflect the biological characteristics of vegetation which is mainly affected by the length of the growth period and the leaf surface index of the vegetation community the limiting coefficient of soil moisture mainly reflects the influence of soil moisture on plant transpiration during the growing period of reed april november the ecological water requirements of vegetation were calculated according to the above method the ecological water requirements for reed in the long river basin are shown in fig 6 the typical river section of the long river basin beichang station zhangdongwu station meets the suitable annual water required for reed growth 19 800 m3 and has an annual minimum water volume of 15 100 m3 the suitable water depths for the initial growth stage development stage middle growth stage and later growth stage of reed are 0 2 m 0 4 m 0 5 m and 0 3 m respectively the available habitat area corresponding to each growth stage was calculated as 23 401 m2 46 802 m2 58 502 m2 and 35 101 m2 respectively to maintain the health of the river ecosystem based on the water requirements of the indicated vegetation in the riparian zone the ecological water requirements of each life cycle of reed was determined the life cycle of the vegetation was basically consistent with the growth stage of the indicated fish the appropriate ecological flow of pseudorasbora parva at each growth stage could meet the ecological water requirements of the indicated reed 4 6 habitat suitability curve channel substrates and mulch are usually not sensitive in flow related habitat analysis pseudorasbora parva has a wide range of water temperature suitability in river water and temperature change does not affect its survival jiang et al 2012 compared with flow velocity and water depth the effects of the channel index and water temperature can be ignored and their suitability are assigned as 1 through consulting the domestic and foreign literature hou et al 2019 combined with the research results of the suitability curve for carp and relying on expert consultation and field investigations the habitat suitability curve for pseudorasbora parva at different growth stages is generated and shown in fig 7 based on the hydrodynamic simulation results from the studied section of the long river with different flows the product method was used in this paper to calculate the suitable habitat area for pseudorasbora parva in the representative section the suitable habitat area of the river reach was obtained through arithmetical averaging as shown in fig 8 4 7 discussion the wua in various growth stages of pseudorasbora parva gradually increased with increasing flow and peaked at a certain flow then the wua decreased with increasing flow and the decreasing trend gradually decreased during the spawning period of pseudorasbora parva wua showed a significant turning point at 3 24 m3 s and then its growth became slow reaching a peak of 11 326 m2 at 21 6 m3 s after that wua gradually decreased and finally stabilized during the breeding period wua showed a significant turning point at 4 32 m3 s which slowly increased to a peak of 14 557 m2 at 32 4 m3 s and then gradually decreased to a stable level in the growth stage the turning point of wua was significantly delayed with the increase of flow appearing at 10 8 m3 s then increased slowly reaching a peak value of 20 809 m2 at 216 m3 s and finally gradually decreased under the condition of low flow the wua in the growth stage of pseudorasbora parva is smaller than that in the spawning stage and the breeding stage while the wua in the growth stage of pseudorasbora parva under the condition of high flow is larger than in the other two life stages fig 6 in the growth stage p parva prefers a deep water environment the optimum water depth is 0 5 2 0 m but p parva is also distributed in shallow water under the condition of high flow the wua of each growth stage was ranked as follows the growth stage was the largest the breeding stage was the second largest and the spawning stage was the smallest the suitable water depth and flow velocity conditions in the growth period of pseudorasbora parva have a wider range so only adult pseudorasbora parva can survive in a high flow environment and fish eggs and juveniles are mainly distributed in shallow water the peak value of wua at each growth stage corresponds to the flow at the growth stage at the breeding stage at the spawning stage which is consistent with the suitable habitat conditions at each growth stage based on the simulation results of the wua changing in each growth stage with the discharge the suitable flow range of the target fish in the long river was analysed the ecological flow was determined according to the suitable flow of the target fish pseudorasbora parva at each growth stage in practice when larger rivers or target species have excessively high requirements for river habitat factors the flow corresponding to the maximum wua is regarded as the ecological flow this method does not meet the requirements of river passage research nor does it meet the requirements of maintaining river health furthermore in the actual environment of the study river many biological resources that need to be protected therefore in general the ecological flow calculated from the habitat suitability curve selected by only one biological species will be too large therefore it is difficult to achieve the maximum value of the theoretical calculation in the actual operation of ecological flow even under natural conditions the maximum wua corresponding to the flow is difficult to ensure therefore the flow corresponding to the obvious turning point on the flow wua curve is selected as the ecological flow the long river basin belongs to a small river with a low width depth index the value of the wua at the turning point of the flow wua curve is the optimal value for the growth of the target fish in the studied river reach when there was an obvious turning point in the flow wua curve during the spawning period the corresponding flow q was 3 24 m3 s and the wua of the target fish was 9773 m2 when there was an obvious turning point in the flow wua curve during the breeding period the corresponding flow q was 4 32 m3 s and the habitat suitability area wua of the target fish was 13 270 m2 when there was an obvious turning point in the flow wua curve during the growth period the corresponding flow q was 10 8 m3 s and the habitat suitability area wua of the target fish was 14 589 m2 taking this flow as the target value of the ecological flow in different periods of the long river it can guarantee the living environment of pseudorasbora parva in the river to the greatest extent and meet the ecological flow demand in each growth stage during the growth period of reed the growth condition of reed was closely related to the change of water depth zefan yang 2015 believed that reed could maintain suitable growth in the range of 0 2 1 m water depth and that the optimal water depth range was 0 3 0 5 m chunnuan deng et al 2012 in the analysis of the physiological and ecological law of reed according to the water depth gradient concluded that a water depth of 0 15 m was the minimum ecological water level of reed and a water depth of 0 35 0 45 m could ensure the optimal growth state of reed and was the most suitable ecological water level for reed growth poorter et al 2012 thought that the ecological adaptability of the reed population to the change of water depth gradient was not linear an excessively high water depth 50 cm 150 cm or a too low water depth 0 5 cm had a certain inhibitory effect on the growth of reed the coupling degree between reed plant height and biomass in the suitable water depth interval 5 50 cm was high and reed grew well changming li et al 2015 measured the water depth range and growth characteristics of the distribution of solitary and coexisting reeds and cattail and found that reeds were mainly distributed in shallow water and at a medium water depth 0 50 cm when the water depth was 20 30 cm solitary reeds grew well with the increase of water depth the number of leaves stem diameter plant height and density of solitary reeds first increased and then decreased therefore the suitable water depth in the growing period of reed was 0 2 0 5 m that is when the water depth is less than 0 2 m or more than 0 5 m the growth of reed will be inhibited ecological flow is one of the indicators in river protection and restoration practice at present many studies have estimated the ecological flow of rivers in northern china bao et al 2012 xia et al 2012 huang et al 2014 it would be reasonable to set 30 or more of the natural inflow as the recommended ecological flow of rivers for river ecosystem restoration the minimum ecological flow threshold standard to 31 of annual average flow wu and chen 2018 by selecting the maximum value between the total economic value of the ecological and economic services functions of rivers system the ecological base flow of rivers is 35 02 of the natural runoff in baoji section of weihe river and the long river is 26 cheng et al 2019 in the ertix river the 79 of the annual mean flow was recommended as the ecological flow in the fish breeding period which is in the optimal range of ecological flow shang 2015 the ecological flow is about 50 of the annual mean flow in breeding period of pseudorasbora parva the calculation results in the manuscript were very close to that of cheng et al 2019 and shang 2015 and it provided better aquatic habitat and prevent long river from ecological degradation and achieve river health 5 conclusion in an actual situation it is difficult to realize complete river restoration to an undisturbed naturalized state therefore based on the concept of nbs referring to the natural flow paradigm theory and proceeding from the appeals of the watershed ecosystem itself research on the ecological flow of rivers based on the concept of nature is carried out the processes for restoring both the natural state of rivers and their ecological flows to the maximum extent are studied in this paper pseudorasbora parva and reed are selected as the indicator species and the ecological water demand processes of smelt and riparian reed in the long river basin are calculated by means of the habitat simulation method and the penman monteith formula furthermore the phabsim model is used to simulate the relationship between the change of the flow and the indication of the fish habitat area taking into account the adaptability of the target species to the habitat flow velocity water depth substrate and river cover and the sizes of the ecological flow of pseudorasbora parva in the spawning period april june breeding period july november and growing period december march were determined to be 3 14 m3 s 4 32 m3 s and 2 16 m3 s respectively using the hydrology method of reducing the measured runoff process based on the natural flow process and the water demand process stimulated by fish spawning the pulse flow and flood processes in the spawning period of pseudorasbora parva were calculated a 7 day 90 guarantee rate pulse flow process with a peak flow of 11 31 m3 s and a three day minor flood process with a peak flow of 24 95 m3 s that occurs at the end of spawning period are proposed this study calculated that the suitable ecological flow in each growth stage could meet the ecological water demand of reed at the same period the determination of the ecological flow is an important basis for strengthening the integrated management of water resource development and utilization and for realizing the healthy development of a watershed water ecosystem the manuscript proposed a nested calculation framework for ecological flow of rivers considering the ecological integrity biological diversity morphological diversity and ecological service functions at the watershed scale based on nbs this method is an important basis for quantitative calculation of ecological water demands which can provide a practical and useful evaluation approach for the determination of the watershed health therefore this method is an important basis for characterizing the diversified ecological value and biodiversity and can provide a new idea for technical processes and the implementation of safeguard measures in the determination of ecological flow with the optimization of

4518,hydrodynamic modelling is an important tool for several studies such as flood forecasting and analysis of energy and mass transport in rivers the most common calibration parameter is the roughness coefficient that accounts for the friction term however while uncertainties are associated to this parameter definition it is often defined as constant over time or space even though sophisticated techniques are available for model calibration unsteady flow routing applications usually involve simplified methods such as trial and error and monte carlo strategies these practices can be subjective time consuming and dependent on user experience on the other hand automatic approaches may generate unrealistic values and require large computational efforts this study introduces a new strategy to calibrate one dimensional hydrodynamic models accounting for temporal and spatial variation while maintaining computational thrift among multiple random roughness coefficients a time series is generated according to a linear relationship with observed water depths or flow for five control sections the resulting daily series of parameters are the set for simulation inputs the algorithm was combined with the hydrodynamic module in the sihqual model hydrodynamic and water quality simulation when compared to observed data it showed to be suitable to predict discharges and water levels for different years over 85 km of the iguaçu river located in paraná brazil compared to monte carlo and trial and error techniques for calibration the htc method hydrodynamic temporal calibration was able to match their results or even improve simulations in some cases requiring less user interaction than the other approaches the study highlights the relevance of including a temporal component in model calibration aiming to reduce the overall inherent uncertainty of this process keywords hydrodynamic modelling calibration unsteady flow sihqual model 1 introduction hydrodynamic simulations of fluvial systems are essential for several studies such as flood forecast afshari et al 2018 transport of pollutants heat and salinity des et al 2019 xu et al 2017 among other applications results of interest are discharges water levels and velocity fields along space and time the basis of a hydrodynamic model for one dimensional 1d fluvial flow is the solution of the saint venant equations that account for mass and momentum conservation considering the wide number of variables that characterize flow in rivers and the complex channel geometry some assumptions are made in order to apply the conservation principles represented by saint venant such as friction terms estimated through laws suitable for steady flow mainly based on manning and chézy formulations battjes and labeur 2017 recent research efforts were made to account for channel friction unsteadiness and have led to more accurate simulations e g xia et al 2017 bao et al 2018 bellos et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 nonetheless these studies are based on simplified experiments theoretical data sets or short term events furthermore since these methods introduce additional parameters in the analysis they might cause numerical instabilities and uncertainties in this context most hydrodynamic modelling applications keep on follow the aforementioned hypotheses temporal and spatial changes of roughness coefficients can be affected by several factors such as flow events bed material irregularity of the cross sections and river alignment chow 1959 arcement and schneider 1989 anderson et al 2006 demonstrate that riparian vegetation has a significant effect on wave celerity hydrograph dispersion and skewness the presence of obstructions including bridges and gates for example can be especially relevant when accounting for channel roughness to predict flood discharges ballesteros et al 2011 the importance of proper calibration of one dimensional models is highlighted by costabile et al 2015 the authors state that for this type of representation calibration accounts for channel obstructions and the degree of meandering to represent the influence of hydraulic singularities in the flow in two dimensional approaches on the other hand river sinuosity and bottom irregularities are already represented in the bathymetry furthermore although manning s coefficient n accounts for bottom friction it usually incorporates a poor representation of turbulence losses and geometry for example even though attempts to calibrate hydrodynamic models may include other characteristics to account for these aspects usually related to bathymetry e g brêda et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 the roughness coefficient remains as the main calibration parameter in hydrodynamic modelling studies common techniques include monte carlo simulation teixeira et al 2018 attari and hosseini 2019 and trial and error approaches boulomytis et al 2017 for example advanced algorithms also have been applied to calibrate the friction coefficient such as multi objective optimizations li et al 2018 and dynamically dimensioned searches lin et al 2017 in the same context xu et al 2017 and bessar et al 2020 presented methods to automatically adjust manning s roughness coefficients according to stage or flow observations for flood event forecasting nonetheless as argued by meert et al 2018 real time parameter updating may lead to the need for iterative solutions and introduce long computation times limiting its application in many studies this study introduces a procedure to calibrate a hydrodynamic model through the manning coefficient called htc method hydrodynamic temporal calibration assigning a value to each time and spatial step as input to the simulation time series of coefficients are generated from random uniform distributions to deal with the inherent uncertainty of its determination and are then selected according to observed discharges and water depths in

characteristic values of roughness coefficients according to bed material and geometric traits to support the range of variation defined in this study as verified in fig 2 sections ig2 and ig3 are inside an urban area therefore this reach is impacted by human activities that often affect channel alignment and suppress streambank vegetation decreasing roughness the region between ig3 and ig4 on the other hand is a transition region where agricultural uses and forests are present in the region from ig4 and ig5 channel roughness increases because meanders are formed lastly floodplains are established in the reach ig5 to ig6 where resistance to flow is higher than in previous sections because of these characteristics this study assumes that the spatial variation between control sections is approximately uniform and a linear variation is established n values are assigned to each section ig2 to ig6 and intermediary roughness characteristics are defined through interpolation 2 2 sihqual model sihqual is a physically based model that simulates flow and pollutant transport in the longitudinal direction integrating deterministic and stochastic approaches ferreira et al 2019 the hydrodynamic module describes the transient flow routing accounting for variation of storage capacity and forces acting on the mass of water its mathematical basis are the saint venant equations mahmood 1975 1 b y t ub y x a u x u a x q 2 u t u u x g y x q v l u a g s 0 s f where b represents the cross section top width m which varies with flow depth y m u is the longitudinal velocity of the flow m s a is the cross section area m2 q is the lateral contribution per unit channel length m3 s m g is the acceleration of gravity m s2 v l is the inflow velocity component of the lateral contribution in longitudinal direction m s s 0 is the bottom slope of the channel m m and s f refers to the friction slope m m the terms of eq 2 represent respectively i local acceleration ii convective acceleration iii pressure force iv momentum flux of the lateral contribution v gravity and friction force the friction slope is written as 3 s f nu r h 2 3 2 where n represents the manning roughness coefficient and r h the hydraulic radius m cross sections are represented using trapezoidal and symmetric shapes which simplifies the algorithm and requires only bottom width and side slope estimates through simulations with the hec ras software and full cross sectional geometry information this simplification has been proved as a reasonable hypothesis when compared with natural shapes of the iguaçu river ferreira et al 2017 another assumption is that lateral inputs are the difference of observed hydrographs in each river station diffusely and linearly distributed along the reaches bottom slope is calculated with altitude and distance between river control sections the numerical solution of the saint venant equations is based on the lax diffusive scheme with a temporal and spatial step of 50 s and 500 m respectively the previous comparison with hec ras solutions also validated the numerical solution used in the sihqual model main results from ferreira et al 2017 are reproduced in the supplementary material as well as the natural cross section shapes and a elevation profile of the simulated river length 2 3 calibration techniques the approaches of trial and error monte carlo and htc assign n values for each control point ig2 to ig6 while coefficients for intermediary river sections are defined by linear interpolation this assumption is due to uniformity of land use and geometric features between control points as previously discussed in addition because the simulated river reach evolves from rectified reaches to regions with winding and floodplains n reference values are lower at ig2 and larger at ig6 the monte carlo steps were i generate multiple combinations of input values along the river segment ii simulate them for multiple times and iii select the best combination of n values at last the new set of n input produces an optimized result the htc method on the other hand generates time series of n values for each river section parameters for intermediary time steps are defined through the interpolation function using the piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial matlab 2017 fig 3 represents the conceptual difference among the three strategies while conventional trial and error and monte carlo techniques deal with multiple sets of n coefficients over space the htc approach adds the generation of multiple sets over time the first two techniques require numerous model runs often increasing time consumption and uncertainty the htc method on the other and provides a unique straightforward solution the htc method is summarized in fig 4 daily time series of observed discharge or water depths are split into four sub groups x y z and w according to the dataset quartiles in a second step multiple time series of daily n are randomly generated with uniform distribution between two ranges from 0 025 to 0 040 and from 0 035 to 0 045 next four daily time series are arbitrarily selected two of each interval series a b c and d the selection of appropriate n values is then based on the sub groups defined in step i days at which flow conditions are lower than the median are associated to smaller n corresponding values of series a and b while higher flow is related to the second interval of possible coefficients series c and d at last a new time series of n values is generated according to a direct relationship with discharge or water depth however this strategy may assign more than one manning coefficient to a discharge or water depth due to the stochastic component therefore the determination of roughness data is based on flow conditions rather than directly to bed material or cross section geometry as usually considered by the traditional techniques of trial and error and monte carlo 2 4 performance metrics besides performance metrics visual analysis of hydrographs duration curves and absolute errors are included the statistical measures applied to evaluate model performance in this study are

from to 1 with an optimum value of 1 the coefficient r reflects the linear relationship between the datasets while the rmse computes differences between simulated and observed values the percent bias pbias demonstrates the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than observed values low magnitude pbias indicate accurate model results with an optimal value of zero positive values indicate model underestimation bias and negative values indicate model overestimation bias gupta et al 1999 3 results and discussion the approaches of monte carlo and the htc method were evaluated comparing water level and discharge in ens calculations besides trial and error a test with a constant n for the entire period and river reach was conducted therefore six strategies to calibrate manning roughness coefficients were verified during hydrodynamic simulations performed with the sihqual model for the year 2010 as validation the htc method was also applied for the period 2011 and 2013 2015 3 1 selection of boundary conditions a first step in hydrodynamic simulations is to define proper boundary conditions because eqs 1 and 2 are solved for velocity and water depth the required upstream boundary conditions are time series of discharges and water levels these can be defined by using observed data or through stage flow measurements rating curve simulations with each alternative are compared in table 2 graphics are provided in the supplementary material to support the discussion roughness coefficients are between 0 030 and 0 045 calibrated through trial and error in a previous study ferreira et al 2017 generally it is better to use observed time series rather than a rating curve to estimate levels considering discharge comparisons for 2010 in ig5 for example ens is 0 74 using the first boundary condition and 0 39 while using the rating curve to predict y variations the two approaches generated similar ens coefficients therefore the selected input in this study are the time series of levels in section ig2 3 2 determination of roughness coefficients trial and error was implemented in previous studies ferreira et al 2017 it starts with suggested values by literature according to the expected behavior from each section table 1 upstream sections are associated to smaller roughness coefficients increasing in downstream direction through manual alteration multiple runs and comparison of nash sutcliffe coefficients a satisfactory result was obtained in the test with constant n for the entire period and river reach a roughness coefficient of 0 03 was obtained a common value for natural channels as suggested in table 1 in the monte carlo strategy one hundred sets of n coefficients for each control section ig2 to ig6 were generated fig 5 they have a uniform distribution and are inside two ranges from 0 025 to 0 04 in section ig2 to ig4 and from 0 025 to 0 065 for ig5 and ig6 these limits are based on a linear possible variation following this phase one hundred hydrodynamic simulations were performed with each combination as compared in fig 6 results indicate the best values of n coefficients inside the limited range for each control section considering q or y as parameters for comparison in the ens metric the optimized n values determined by monte carlo simulations agree with the physical behavior from each cross section as presented in table 3 and fig 7 the representation also shows manning roughness obtained through trial and error as expected larger values occur in sections with presence of meanders and vegetation which is compatible with the characteristics downstream the simulated reach table 3 and fig 7 also highlight a difference when using q or y as optimization criterion using the monte carlo strategy sections ig5 and ig6 are located in floodplain regions where a compound stage discharge relationship is common petersen øverleir 2008 which explains this behavior a similar map of spatial temporal changes generated by the htc method is available as supplementary material the htc approach to define time series of n coefficients in each river section generated the results presented in fig 8 it can be verified that overall discharges and water levels are directly proportional to n values however for some days during the year larger values of n were generated for low water levels this is the expected physical behavior although dependent on several factors and river conditions chow 1959 states that in general n values tend to be larger at the floodplain and if the banks are grassy which corresponds to higher stages on the other hand when the water is shallow bottom irregularities might be responsible for increased roughness the input range of variation in the htc method is more narrow over space than for the monte carlo approach 0 025 0 045 against 0 025 0 065 since variability is accounted for also as temporal variation this is advantageous because it reduces uncertainty in the calibration process while maintaining physical meaning besides consuming less time than the other techniques 3 3 comparison of simulated data the six approaches are summarized in table 4 with a nomenclature to facilitate differentiation figs 9 11 present a comparison among all six strategies and observed data in each control section while fig 13 shows performance metrics for all approaches regarding the overall hydrodynamic simulations a few aspects are relevant hydraulic modifications occur upstream of ig5 where the channel has meanders because the model propagates information from ig2 in downstream direction such modifications may be not properly represented the bed slope variation or the rating curve extrapolation for example may contribute to the overestimation of some peaks as observed mainly in section ig5 additionally the results for section ig3 show that water level is overestimated by the model although the discharge simulation is adequate this result might indicate that the benchmark level needs further investigation nevertheless the test serves its purpose in this study which is to show that considering temporal aspects in the calibration procedure generates similar or better results than trial and error or monte carlo methods considering each calibration strategy the comparisons of hydrographs fig 9 duration curves fig 10 and absolute errors figs 11 and 12 indicate that overall all tests generate similar simulation results the first two representations show that all strategies are able to reproduce temporal evolution and annual regime of flow and water level ensuring that variability and seasonal patterns are captured a few differences are observed for maximum values as highlighted by the analysis of absolute error between simulated and observed data it can be verified that the htc method improves peak flow estimation the same analysis shows that using one n value for the entire period and reach of simulation generates more errors fig 13 compares statistical metrics for each calibration strategy results also support the findings through visual analysis showing that the htc method either improves results or generates results very similar to the trial and error monte carlo method or using constant values for ens r and rmse calculations most differences among the strategies are for section ig5 since as discussed before it has inconsistencies for peak flow estimation high r values for y at ig3 confirm that this metric although valuable to show that temporal changes in the model are compatible with observed data should be accompanied by other parameters for validation pbias comparison shows that there is model underestimation bias at sections ig5 and ig6 while ig3 and ig4 show model overestimation bias this result might be explained by the fact that ig5 and ig6 are located at regions with meanders and are susceptible to floods which could be better addressed by a two dimensional representation nonetheless the one dimensional model requires less computational effort and data and it is an useful tool to estimate multiple purpose scenarios 3 4 validation of the htc method using the htc method for calibration hydrodynamic simulations were performed for the years 2011 and 2013 2015 with n time series generated according to observed discharges simulation conditions are the same as those in the calibration phase including input ranges of manning coefficients results are presented in figs 14 and 15 emphasizing that the calibration strategy can be applied for multiple flow conditions pearson correlation coefficients r also support this affirmation table 5 with values close to the optimum 4 conclusions this study introduces a strategy to calibrate a hydrodynamic model adding a dynamic component to define roughness coefficients as simulation inputs results show that the htc method leads to similar or better results than traditional trial and error monte carlo simulations or using constant values for the friction term calculation the model was tested for long term one and two years and contrasting events peak and low flows and indicated satisfactory estimates of water depth and flow along the iguaçu river compared to trial and error and monte carlo simulations the htc method is meant to require less user interference and time consumption aiming to improve one dimensional hydrodynamic representations the new approach may also reduce subjectivity related to the roughness coefficient determination since the expected range of variation is set prior to simulations because variability is additionally accounted as temporal variation this range in the presented case study was more narrow 0 025 0 045 than the inputs for monte carlo simulations 0 025 0 065 for example although the relationship between discharge water level with roughness coefficients depends on several factors and river conditions the proposed method showed that it is reasonable to combine a direct proportional approach with a stochastic component in this sense while the htc strategy does not account specifically for the differences between flow in the main channel and the floodplains for example it was able to reproduce the expected physical behavior in terms of spatial and temporal changes in addition key aspects of hydrodynamic modelling are investigated such as upstream boundary conditions and optimization parameters the tests demonstrated that rating curve equations produce reasonable estimates for unsteady simulations although time series of water depth and flows are preferable especially for peak flow calculations it was also highlighted that calibrating for y or q may require different ranges of manning coefficients and that the htc method is applicable for both objectives at last no numerical instabilities or significant extension in computational time were generated when inserting the method in the sihqual solution scheme motivating the algorithm capability in dealing with additional components for instance flow over overbank areas could be accounted to predict flood events with the one dimensional approach in this context future efforts accounting for spatial correlation for example may reduce uncertainty where measured data is not available furthermore probabilistic analysis assessment of statistical distribution for roughness coefficients and

4518,hydrodynamic modelling is an important tool for several studies such as flood forecasting and analysis of energy and mass transport in rivers the most common calibration parameter is the roughness coefficient that accounts for the friction term however while uncertainties are associated to this parameter definition it is often defined as constant over time or space even though sophisticated techniques are available for model calibration unsteady flow routing applications usually involve simplified methods such as trial and error and monte carlo strategies these practices can be subjective time consuming and dependent on user experience on the other hand automatic approaches may generate unrealistic values and require large computational efforts this study introduces a new strategy to calibrate one dimensional hydrodynamic models accounting for temporal and spatial variation while maintaining computational thrift among multiple random roughness coefficients a time series is generated according to a linear relationship with observed water depths or flow for five control sections the resulting daily series of parameters are the set for simulation inputs the algorithm was combined with the hydrodynamic module in the sihqual model hydrodynamic and water quality simulation when compared to observed data it showed to be suitable to predict discharges and water levels for different years over 85 km of the iguaçu river located in paraná brazil compared to monte carlo and trial and error techniques for calibration the htc method hydrodynamic temporal calibration was able to match their results or even improve simulations in some cases requiring less user interaction than the other approaches the study highlights the relevance of including a temporal component in model calibration aiming to reduce the overall inherent uncertainty of this process keywords hydrodynamic modelling calibration unsteady flow sihqual model 1 introduction hydrodynamic simulations of fluvial systems are essential for several studies such as flood forecast afshari et al 2018 transport of pollutants heat and salinity des et al 2019 xu et al 2017 among other applications results of interest are discharges water levels and velocity fields along space and time the basis of a hydrodynamic model for one dimensional 1d fluvial flow is the solution of the saint venant equations that account for mass and momentum conservation considering the wide number of variables that characterize flow in rivers and the complex channel geometry some assumptions are made in order to apply the conservation principles represented by saint venant such as friction terms estimated through laws suitable for steady flow mainly based on manning and chézy formulations battjes and labeur 2017 recent research efforts were made to account for channel friction unsteadiness and have led to more accurate simulations e g xia et al 2017 bao et al 2018 bellos et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 nonetheless these studies are based on simplified experiments theoretical data sets or short term events furthermore since these methods introduce additional parameters in the analysis they might cause numerical instabilities and uncertainties in this context most hydrodynamic modelling applications keep on follow the aforementioned hypotheses temporal and spatial changes of roughness coefficients can be affected by several factors such as flow events bed material irregularity of the cross sections and river alignment chow 1959 arcement and schneider 1989 anderson et al 2006 demonstrate that riparian vegetation has a significant effect on wave celerity hydrograph dispersion and skewness the presence of obstructions including bridges and gates for example can be especially relevant when accounting for channel roughness to predict flood discharges ballesteros et al 2011 the importance of proper calibration of one dimensional models is highlighted by costabile et al 2015 the authors state that for this type of representation calibration accounts for channel obstructions and the degree of meandering to represent the influence of hydraulic singularities in the flow in two dimensional approaches on the other hand river sinuosity and bottom irregularities are already represented in the bathymetry furthermore although manning s coefficient n accounts for bottom friction it usually incorporates a poor representation of turbulence losses and geometry for example even though attempts to calibrate hydrodynamic models may include other characteristics to account for these aspects usually related to bathymetry e g brêda et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 the roughness coefficient remains as the main calibration parameter in hydrodynamic modelling studies common techniques include monte carlo simulation teixeira et al 2018 attari and hosseini 2019 and trial and error approaches boulomytis et al 2017 for example advanced algorithms also have been applied to calibrate the friction coefficient such as multi objective optimizations li et al 2018 and dynamically dimensioned searches lin et al 2017 in the same context xu et al 2017 and bessar et al 2020 presented methods to automatically adjust manning s roughness coefficients according to stage or flow observations for flood event forecasting nonetheless as argued by meert et al 2018 real time parameter updating may lead to the need for iterative solutions and introduce long computation times limiting its application in many studies this study introduces a procedure to calibrate a hydrodynamic model through the manning coefficient called htc method hydrodynamic temporal calibration assigning a value to each time and spatial step as input to the simulation time series of coefficients are generated from random uniform distributions to deal with the inherent uncertainty of its determination and are then selected according to observed discharges and water depths in control sections this approach is based on a previous study of water quality modelling in which daily reaction coefficients were estimated as model input ferreira et al 2020 these parameters represent physical chemical and biological transformations that pollutants go through in contact with water similarly to n values they usually depend on several system conditions becoming calibration parameters and incorporating overall uncertainties of their determination empirical studies usually report a variable relationship between flow rate or water depth and manning roughness coefficients depending on

alternative are compared in table 2 graphics are provided in the supplementary material to support the discussion roughness coefficients are between 0 030 and 0 045 calibrated through trial and error in a previous study ferreira et al 2017 generally it is better to use observed time series rather than a rating curve to estimate levels considering discharge comparisons for 2010 in ig5 for example ens is 0 74 using the first boundary condition and 0 39 while using the rating curve to predict y variations the two approaches generated similar ens coefficients therefore the selected input in this study are the time series of levels in section ig2 3 2 determination of roughness coefficients trial and error was implemented in previous studies ferreira et al 2017 it starts with suggested values by literature according to the expected behavior from each section table 1 upstream sections are associated to smaller roughness coefficients increasing in downstream direction through manual alteration multiple runs and comparison of nash sutcliffe coefficients a satisfactory result was obtained in the test with constant n for the entire period and river reach a roughness coefficient of 0 03 was obtained a common value for natural channels as suggested in table 1 in the monte carlo strategy one hundred sets of n coefficients for each control section ig2 to ig6 were generated fig 5 they have a uniform distribution and are inside two ranges from 0 025 to 0 04 in section ig2 to ig4 and from 0 025 to 0 065 for ig5 and ig6 these limits are based on a linear possible variation following this phase one hundred hydrodynamic simulations were performed with each combination as compared in fig 6 results indicate the best values of n coefficients inside the limited range for each control section considering q or y as parameters for comparison in the ens metric the optimized n values determined by monte carlo simulations agree with the physical behavior from each cross section as presented in table 3 and fig 7 the representation also shows manning roughness obtained through trial and error as expected larger values occur in sections with presence of meanders and vegetation which is compatible with the characteristics downstream the simulated reach table 3 and fig 7 also highlight a difference when using q or y as optimization criterion using the monte carlo strategy sections ig5 and ig6 are located in floodplain regions where a compound stage discharge relationship is common petersen øverleir 2008 which explains this behavior a similar map of spatial temporal changes generated by the htc method is available as supplementary material the htc approach to define time series of n coefficients in each river section generated the results presented in fig 8 it can be verified that overall discharges and water levels are directly proportional to n values however for some days during the year larger values of n were generated for low water levels this is the expected physical behavior although dependent on several factors and river conditions chow 1959 states that in general n values tend to be larger at the floodplain and if the banks are grassy which corresponds to higher stages on the other hand when the water is shallow bottom irregularities might be responsible for increased roughness the input range of variation in the htc method is more narrow over space than for the monte carlo approach 0 025 0 045 against 0 025 0 065 since variability is accounted for also as temporal variation this is advantageous because it reduces uncertainty in the calibration process while maintaining physical meaning besides consuming less time than the other techniques 3 3 comparison of simulated data the six approaches are summarized in table 4 with a nomenclature to facilitate differentiation figs 9 11 present a comparison among all six strategies and observed data in each control section while fig 13 shows performance metrics for all approaches regarding the overall hydrodynamic simulations a few aspects are relevant hydraulic modifications occur upstream of ig5 where the channel has meanders because the model propagates information from ig2 in downstream direction such modifications may be not properly represented the bed slope variation or the rating curve extrapolation for example may contribute to the overestimation of some peaks as observed mainly in section ig5 additionally the results for section ig3 show that water level is overestimated by the model although the discharge simulation is adequate this result might indicate that the benchmark level needs further investigation nevertheless the test serves its purpose in this study which is to show that considering temporal aspects in the calibration procedure generates similar or better results than trial and error or monte carlo methods considering each calibration strategy the comparisons of hydrographs fig 9 duration curves fig 10 and absolute errors figs 11 and 12 indicate that overall all tests generate similar simulation results the first two representations show that all strategies are able to reproduce temporal evolution and annual regime of flow and water level ensuring that variability and seasonal patterns are captured a few differences are observed for maximum values as highlighted by the analysis of absolute error between simulated and observed data it can be verified that the htc method improves peak flow estimation the same analysis shows that using one n value for the entire period and reach of simulation generates more errors fig 13 compares statistical metrics for each calibration strategy results also support the findings through visual analysis showing that the htc method either improves results or generates results very similar to the trial and error monte carlo method or using constant values for ens r and rmse calculations most differences among the strategies are for section ig5 since as discussed before it has inconsistencies for peak flow estimation high r values for y at ig3 confirm that this metric although valuable to show that temporal changes in the model are compatible with observed data should be accompanied by other parameters for validation pbias comparison shows that there is model underestimation bias at sections ig5 and ig6 while ig3 and ig4 show model overestimation bias this result might be explained by the fact that ig5 and ig6 are located at regions with meanders and are susceptible to floods which could be better addressed by a two dimensional representation nonetheless the one dimensional model requires less computational effort and data and it is an useful tool to estimate multiple purpose scenarios 3 4 validation of the htc method using the htc method for calibration hydrodynamic simulations were performed for the years 2011 and 2013 2015 with n time series generated according to observed discharges simulation conditions are the same as those in the calibration phase including input ranges of manning coefficients results are presented in figs 14 and 15 emphasizing that the calibration strategy can be applied for multiple flow conditions pearson correlation coefficients r also support this affirmation table 5 with values close to the optimum 4 conclusions this study introduces a strategy to calibrate a hydrodynamic model adding a dynamic component to define roughness coefficients as simulation inputs results show that the htc method leads to similar or better results than traditional trial and error monte carlo simulations or using constant values for the friction term calculation the model was tested for long term one and two years and contrasting events peak and low flows and indicated satisfactory estimates of water depth and flow along the iguaçu river compared to trial and error and monte carlo simulations the htc method is meant to require less user interference and time consumption aiming to improve one dimensional hydrodynamic representations the new approach may also reduce subjectivity related to the roughness coefficient determination since the expected range of variation is set prior to simulations because variability is additionally accounted as temporal variation this range in the presented case study was more narrow 0 025 0 045 than the inputs for monte carlo simulations 0 025 0 065 for example although the relationship between discharge water level with roughness coefficients depends on several factors and river conditions the proposed method showed that it is reasonable to combine a direct proportional approach with a stochastic component in this sense while the htc strategy does not account specifically for the differences between flow in the main channel and the floodplains for example it was able to reproduce the expected physical behavior in terms of spatial and temporal changes in addition key aspects of hydrodynamic modelling are investigated such as upstream boundary conditions and optimization parameters the tests demonstrated that rating curve equations produce reasonable estimates for unsteady simulations although time series of water depth and flows are preferable especially for peak flow calculations it was also highlighted that calibrating for y or q may require different ranges of manning coefficients and that the htc method is applicable for both objectives at last no numerical instabilities or significant extension in computational time were generated when inserting the method in the sihqual solution scheme motivating the algorithm capability in dealing with additional components for instance flow over overbank areas could be accounted to predict flood events with the one dimensional approach in this context future efforts accounting for spatial correlation for example may reduce uncertainty where measured data is not available furthermore probabilistic analysis assessment of statistical distribution for roughness coefficients and investigation towards their empirical relationship with water depths and discharges are encouraged credit authorship contribution statement danieli mara ferreira conceptualization methodology software

4519,observations of tidal propagation in coastal aquifers allow for rapid low cost quantification of aquifer parameters that are integrated over significant distances previous methods for aquifer property estimation from tidal propagation have focussed on continental aquifers and assumed straight infinite shorelines a recent investigation has proposed a correction to the ferris analytical solution for straight shorelines ferris solution to be applied under radial flow conditions in this paper an existing analytical solution as a function of radial flow conditions circular solution and the corrected ferris solution are applied for the first time to obtain aquifer diffusivity in orbiculate shaped islands inversion of the circular solution to obtain diffusivity requires iterative methods which are applied to synthetic island aquifers with known diffusivity values ranging between 150 000 m2 d and 500 000 m2 d the circular solution was tested for both confined and unconfined conditions and for tidal periods ranging from around 8 to 24 h known aquifer diffusivity values were reproduced within 2 5 of known values even where randomised noise was added to synthetic groundwater tidal signals and for both confined and unconfined aquifer conditions application of the corrected ferris solution was found to be reliable for both confined and unconfined conditions with discrepancies in aquifer diffusivity 1 and 2 5 respectively including with noise added to the groundwater tidal signals the methodology presented in this work to estimate aquifer diffusivity in orbiculate shaped islands is an improvement over classic approaches e g the ferris solution in particular the radial flow correction to the ferris solution provides for simple calculations of aquifer

essential to understand and predict groundwater responses to hydrologic stresses evaluating the aquifer properties of islands is particularly important because groundwater is often the only source of freshwater and the vulnerability of island aquifers to degradation from anthropogenic and environmental factors is often very high e g white and falkland 2010 werner et al 2017 for example the salinization of pumping wells on islands is common because fresh groundwater typically occurs as relatively thin lenses that float above saltwater e g werner et al 2013 mitigating water quality degradation on islands therefore requires effective water management based on reasonable estimates of aquifer properties field based estimates of aquifer hydraulic properties are commonly obtained by actually stressing the aquifer and observing its response in a given period of time for example in the form of pumping tests e g theis 1935 alternatively passive forms of aquifer testing may be undertaken such as the measurement of the fluctuations in coastal groundwater levels caused by ocean tides aquifer properties control the tidal propagation which is manifested in aquifers as attenuation in the tidal amplitude and lag in the tidal phase relative to the ocean tide extracting information about aquifer properties from tidal groundwater fluctuations was first proposed by ferris 1951 based on earlier work by jacob 1950 compared to pumping tests tidal aquifer testing requires significantly less infrastructure and in most circumstances provides integrated knowledge i e spatially averages of aquifer properties over larger scales than can feasibly be obtained from pumping tests the analytical solution hereafter referred to as the circular solution to periodic radial flow within circular homogeneous aquifers first appeared in the report of williams et al 1970 and was subsequently analysed by townley 1995 who expressed the mathematical solution in terms of modified bessel functions e g abramowitz and stegun 1965 williams et al 1970 derived the solution through application of kelvin functions e g abramowitz and stegun 1965 despite the different functions used the two solutions are equivalent the circular solution has not been applied previously to determine aquifer properties i e of islands whereas the ferris solution is used routinely in the estimation of aquifer hydraulic diffusivity e g jha et al 2003 banerjee et al 2008 zhou 2008 rotzoll et al 2013 chattopadhyay et al 2014 xun et al 2015 aquifer hydraulic diffusivity λ l2 t 1 is defined by λ t s where t is transmissivity l2 t 1 and s is storativity the ferris solution has the advantage of allowing direct calculation of λ whereas the circular solution requires iterative methods to obtain λ from tidal signals solórzano rivas and werner 2020 recently compared the circular solution to the widely used analytical solution of ferris 1951 hereafter the ferris solution which applies to straight coastlines solórzano rivas and werner 2020 demonstrated that application of the ferris solution to tidal propagation in curved boundaries may be valid within 10 error for distances from the shoreline of up to about 20 of the island radius however it may incur errors of up to 80 towards the island centre they also provided a relationship between the ferris and circular solutions for the estimation of tidal amplitude decay and phase shift and adopted this as a correction factor to the ferris solution previous studies indicate that values of λ inferred from field based observations of groundwater tidal amplitude differ to λ values obtained from field based phase lag observations e g ferris 1951 smith 1999 rotzoll et al 2008 2013 trefry and bekele 2004 used numerical modelling to identify different possible reasons for discrepancies between λ values obtained from the amplitude and phase for instance they tested different scenarios to represent a range of simplified real world factors such as unconfined flow density dependent flow anisotropic aquifer properties boundary geometry variability and aquifer heterogeneity they found that among the different explored processes the dominant cause of inconsistent λ values between amplitude based and phase lag based predictions was aquifer heterogeneity specifically they found that layering variation in hydraulic conductivity with depth adopting a high k bottom layer and a low k top layer caused the largest discrepancy in λ estimates inferred from tidal amplitude and phase lag values the above complexities of real world settings are potential sources of noise in groundwater tides which add to the challenges of extracting parameter estimates from tide based approaches the objective of the present work is to demonstrate and critically assess the application of the circular solution to the estimation of aquifer hydraulic properties i e λ of orbiculate islands the analysis is divided into four parts that reflect the study objectives 1 the method is applied to a complex groundwater tide created by the effects of multiple ocean tide constituents the resulting multi constituent i e compound groundwater tide is produced by applying the circular solution and assuming superposition 2 a sensitivity analysis is undertaken to assess relationships between the predicted λ value and the tidal characteristics i e amplitude and phase 3 the solórzano rivas and werner 2020 correction factor to the ferris solution to allow its application to circular islands for estimating λ is evaluated as a replacement to the circular solution 4 the circular solution devised for confined aquifer conditions is tested for applicability to unconfined aquifer conditions 2 methods 2 1 circular solution to tidal propagation tidal propagation in a homogeneous isotropic circular aquifer i e an orbiculate shaped island can be resolved by solving the one dimensional axisymmetric groundwater flow equation with tidal boundary conditions in radial coordinates williams et al 1970 townley 1995 solórzano rivas and werner 2020 here the aquifer is assumed to be confined and of uniform geometry most island aquifers containing freshwater are likely to be unconfined especially for small to medium islands e g werner et al 2017 thus the application of the confined aquifer solution to unconfined aquifers is an approximation which we evaluate fig 1 shows a schematic island cross section in radial coordinates subject to a tidal force at the seaward boundary the circular solution described by solórzano rivas and werner 2020 is given as 1 h t a g s i n ω t φ where 2 a g a 0 c 2 d 2 3 c r i 0 γ r i 0 γ a 4 d i i 0 γ r i 0 γ a 5 φ tan 1 d c here h is the groundwater elevation l with respect to mean sea level msl a g is the groundwater tidal amplitude l a 0 is the tidal amplitude at the shoreline l ω is the tidal angular frequency rad t 1 t is time t and φ is the phase lag rad relative to the ocean tide r and i indicate the real and imaginary parts respectively of the complex valued function i 0 γ r i 0 γ a i 0 is the modified bessel function of the first kind of order zero e g abramowitz and stegun 1965 and γ is β i where β ω s t and s and t are the storativity and transmissivity l2 t 1 respectively 2 2 generation of synthetic ocean tides ocean tides comprise different tidal constituents for example the seven constituents m2 s2 n2 k1 k2 p1 and o1 account for more than approximately 80 of real world tides kvale 2012 in this study a synthetic compound tide created as the sum of three tidal constituents is used for the shoreline boundary condition as outlined in table 1 constituent 1 is the oceanic semidiurnal lunar tide m2 tidal period τ 12 42 h m2 is the principal tidal constituent in oceanic tides with the largest amplitude tidal potential doodson 1954 constituent 2 is the lunar solar diurnal principal constituent k1 τ 23 93 h and constituent 3 is the compound tide mk3 that arises from the combination of m2 and k1 when they pass through shallow water depths e g luick 2004 mk3 is adopted because the amplitude and velocity of ocean tides are disturbed in shallow sea depths due to the friction effects thereby altering the otherwise simple harmonic characteristics of the tides that occur in deeper waters e g godin 1972 these effects can be treated as the appearance of new harmonics of the original frequency defined as shallow water tides e g gallagher and munk 1971 godin 1972 stewart 2008 godin 1972 recommended as normal practice the inclusion of shallow water constituents in the analysis of tides that reach the coastline because they are always present in seawater bodies of shallow depth including estuaries and bays as long as these are hydraulically connected to the ocean this approach is an improvement over previous studies that test tidal propagation methods because these almost exclusively neglect shallow water tides 2 3 tidal propagation observed groundwater tides a base case model was developed for a hypothetical small island of a 3000 m and three scenarios were considered to represent different values of λ i e λ 1 150 000 m2 d λ 2 350 000 m2 d and λ 3 500 000 m2 d these values are within the normal range of t s found for real islands e g trefry and bekele 2004 cabrera and custodio 2004 the circular solution was then applied to create data i e synthetic tidal groundwater hydrographs that we treat as surrogates for field observations using these parameters observed data were produced at three inland locations namely at distances from the shoreline equal to 10 20 and 30 of the island radius i e 0 1a 0 2a and 0 3a for both confined and unconfined conditions the circular solution was used to create compound tidal conditions through the application of superposition whereby compound oceanic tides are taken as the sum of individual constituents i e m2 k1 and mk3 superposition applies to confined aquifer problems because of linearity in the relevant theory whereas tidal propagation in unconfined aquifers is non linear although it is common practice to linearise unconfined groundwater flow for mathematical convenience bear 1979 the application of the circular solution and superposition to the propagation of a compound tidal signal was firstly compared to the results of confined aquifer numerical simulations to confirm the methodology similar to the verification undertaken by solórzano rivas and werner 2020 for a single tide numerical modelling adopted a version of seawat modified by post 2011 to allow the simulation of tidal boundary conditions namely through implementation of the periodic boundary condition pbc package and the methodology described by langevin 2008 to adjust the input parameters of seawat to represent radial flow coordinates the pbc package allows the user to define a multiple constituent tide at the shoreline boundary comparison between the numerical model and the analytical solution showed an excellent match as expected for example at the distance from the shoreline equal to 0 3a and the λ 2 scenario i e 350 000 m2 d the root mean square error rmse was 0 004 m see table 1 for tidal amplitudes solórzano rivas and werner 2020 showed the same good agreement between analytical and numerical results using seawat post 2011 when only one tidal constituent was used numerical models using seawat post 2011 were used to create tidal propagation in unconfined conditions for which superposition does not strictly apply thereby restricting the application of superposition in assessments of compound tides based on analytical solutions the same three λ scenarios i e 150 000 m2 d 350 000 m2 d and 500 000 m2 d used with confined conditions were analysed in the numerical modelling of unconfined aquifers unconfined simulations involved tidal variations in the aquifer thickness which creates fluctuations in t while storativity remains time invariant we adopted the same storativity in both unconfined and confined numerical models even though specific yield in unconfined aquifers is typically several orders of magnitude higher than the storativity of confined aquifers to isolate the effects of tidal depth changes on the application of the circular solution to unconfined conditions to reproduce those three λ scenarios in a fluctuating water table the numerical model was designed so the time averaged aquifer thickness over one tide period is 10 m considering that the model bottom elevation is 10 m the top model elevation is 2 m and mean sea level has an elevation of 0 m however unconfined aquifer simulations to generate observed groundwater tides adopted a monochromatic tidal signal using only the k1 constituent which travelled further into the unconfined aquifer due to its lower tidal frequency f table 1 than the other higher frequency tides this led to groundwater tidal amplitudes that were higher than the minimum threshold for field measurement with a standard water level logger i e a 1 cm at the three inland locations and three λ scenarios for example groundwater amplitudes from the tidal constituent m2 and the largest diffusivity scenario i e 500 000 m2 d were 1 5 mm at the three locations results shown at table s9 in the supplementary information the observations of synthetic groundwater tides obtained through application of the radial analytical solution to the three inland locations are termed theoretical observations hereafter the groundwater tides obtained from numerical modelling are described as numerical observations field measurements of coastal groundwater tides invariably show the influence of non tidal factors due to for example time variant recharge and pumping spatial heterogeneity measurement error and aquifer geometry variability e g erskine 1991 to reflect these departures from the idealised sinusoidal signals inherent in theoretical and numerical observations random noise was added to these otherwise idealised signals the resulting new sets of observed data are referred to as theoretical observations with noise and numerical observations with noise noise was generated in two steps first a random uniform distribution over the range 0 025 m to 0 025 m was created to represent device error and other complications in the measurement process based on typical pressure transducer error adopting 50 m of measuring range and accuracy of 0 05 in situ inc 2020 a second set of random values was generated using a normal distribution of mean equal to 0 00 m and standard deviation of 0 01 m to emulate other complicating factors on groundwater levels the two random error time series were then added to theoretical and numerical observations while the choice of noise parameters is effectively arbitrary the noise statistical properties selected here produced synthetic groundwater tides that appear from visual inspection as roughly similar to real world groundwater hydrographs e g merritt 2004 xun et al 2006 fig 2 shows an example of two hypothetical groundwater tides based on theoretical observations and theoretical observations with noise 2 4 harmonic analysis harmonic analysis of synthetic groundwater tides was undertaken to obtain observed groundwater amplitudes and phase lags e g fig 2 for every tidal component i e the m2 k1 and mk3 constituents this was achieved using discrete linear least squares estimation lse e g kay 1993 amplitudes and phase lags from theoretical observations are denoted as a g obs and φ obs respectively corresponding parameters for other synthetic time series include a g obs and φ obs theoretical observations with noise a n obs and φ n obs numerical observations and a n obs and φ n obs numerical observations with noise lse presumes that the observed groundwater tides can be described by e g boon and kiley 1978 6 y t j 1 n a g j cos ω j t φ o b s j π 2 t 0 δ t 2 δ t n 1 δ t where y is the groundwater level l with respect to msl j is the tidal constituent n is the total of tidal constituents analysed i e n 3 and n is the total number of data points such that n ts δt where ts and δt are the total simulation time and sampling time step respectively δt was set to 30 min equation 6 adopts a cosine function and subtracts π 2 from the argument rather than the sine function of equation 1 to conform with the approach of boon and kiley 1978 while the formulations presented in this section are expressed as functions of a g obs and φ obs the same harmonic analysis was applied to obtain a g obs φ obs a n obs φ n obs and a n obs φ n obs a convenient way to express equation 6 for lse procedures is as follows 7 y t j 1 n α 1 j cos ω j t j 1 n α 2 j sin ω j t t 0 δ t 2 δ t n 1 δ t here α 1 j a g obs j cos φ o b s j π 2 and α 2 j a g obs j sin φ o b s j π 2 equation 7 can be expressed in matrix notation represented by bold fonts as y h θ where h is a matrix of dimensions n 2n composed of the sine and cosine terms in equation 7 and θ is the least squares approximation of α 1 j and α 2 j with dimensions 2n 1 that can be computed as e g kay 1993 8 θ h t h 1 h t y where the superscripts t and 1 in equation 8 indicate the matrix transpose and inverse respectively then the observed tidal parameters a g obs and φ obs can be estimated as 9 a g obs j α 1 j 2 α 2 j 2 10 φ obs j tan 1 α 2 j α 1 j π 2 given the form of equation 10 φ obs does not increase monotonically with distance as occurs in reality rather phase lags 2π are output as φ obs 2π this differs from the ferris solution whereby the phase lag increases monotonically with distance as expected although this has no implications for the inverse problem of estimating λ using the circular solution it affects λ estimation from the corrected ferris solution which requires the complete phase lag that is we account for the number of tidal cycles that have transpired in estimating λ using the corrected ferris solution where the phase lag exceeds a tidal cycle i e φ obs 2π it is expected that the observed groundwater amplitudes and phase lags obtained from harmonic analysis of theoretical observations with noise and numerical observations both with and without noise i e a g obs φ obs a n obs φ n obs and a n obs φ n obs will show some departures from the corresponding theoretical observations a g obs and φ obs these departures were estimated and expressed as relative errors as follows 11 e a a g o b s a g o b s a g o b s 100 12 e φ φ o b s φ o b s φ o b s 100 equations 11 and 12 also apply for discrepancies between a n obs φ n obs a n obs φ n obs and the corresponding a g obs and φ obs values 2 5 determination of λ through application of the circular solution in the case of the circular solution λ can only be determined through iterative methods since t and s are part of the argument γ of the modified bessel functions see equations 2 and 3 which cannot be directly inverted here an optimization technique is used namely the nelder mead simplex method nelder and mead 1965 which is applied within the algorithm implemented in the python function scipy optimize fmin parameter estimation is performed by the minimisation of two objective functions o a λ a and o p λ φ which represent discrepancies between model estimated and observed diffusivity values of the tidal amplitude λ a and phase lag λ φ respectively the objective functions are given by 13 o a λ a a g o b s a g 2 14 o p λ φ φ o b s φ 2 where a g obs and φ obs are obtained through harmonic analysis section 2 4 and a g and φ are the values obtained from equations 2 and 5 respectively we first verified that the two objective functions given in equations 13 and 14 provide the same λ values as the original values used in the base case model that generated the synthetic observations see section 2 3 this was undertaken initially on theoretical observations i e without noise to provide a check on our implementation of the methodology and equations to determine λ a perfect match was obtained e g errors 10 8 thereby affirming the technique for ideal measurement datasets the use of tidal parameters based on theoretical observations with noise i e a g obs and φ obs is expected to lead to differences in the calculations of λ a and λ φ i e from inversion due to the influence of noise as discussed earlier in addition to objective functions based only on amplitude or phase lag misfit i e equation 13 and equation 14 respectively a multi objective function was tested to explore values of λ that arise by combining both amplitude and phase lag misfit the multi objective function was determined as 15 o a p λ a φ a g o b s a g 2 φ o b s φ 2 note that the amplitude and phase misfits are weighted equally in o a p λ a φ following the approach of trefry and bekele 2004 in this study the three objective functions i e equations 13 14 and 15 are applied to estimate λ namely when observed parameters amplitude and phase lags are extracted from observations theoretical and numerical with noise the average diffusivity λ av λ a λ φ 2 was also computed the relative error e r with respect to the known λ value and identified as λ specified adopted in creating synthetic observations in the three scenarios studied i e 150 000 m2 d 350 000 m2 d and 500 000 m2 d was then calculated as 16 e r λ a λ s p e c i f i e d λ s p e c i f i e d 100 e r values that apply to alternative methods for estimating λ were obtained by substituting λ φ λ a φ and λ av into equation 16 2 6 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the sensitivity of diffusivity i e λ a and λ φ to differences in a g obs and φ obs to explore the effect of discrepancies in a g obs φ obs a n obs φ n obs a n obs or φ n obs on the estimation of λ synthetic observations did not incorporate any noise the following discrete form for non dimensional local sensitivity e g robinson and werner 2017 was adopted 17 s p δ o o δ p here s is the non dimensional local sensitivity p is the input parameter i e a g obs or φ obs o is the output parameter i e λ a or λ φ and δ represents a discrete change applying a central finite difference approximation and assuming that δ δ p p equation 17 can be written as 18 s o p δ p o p δ p 2 o δ in this study a value of δ of 0 005 0 5 was adopted 2 7 application of the solórzano rivas and werner 2020 correction factor solórzano rivas and werner 2020 found that when the aquifer properties lead to magnitudes of γ r 2 and γ a 2 φ φ f and a g a g f a r where a gf and φ f are the amplitude tide and phase lag respectively estimated by the ferris solution this allows for the application of the solórzano rivas and werner 2020 correction factor to the ferris solution which provides for a simpler calculation

λ avf and the specified λ in the three λ scenarios i e 150 000 m2 d 350 000 m2 d and 500 000 m2 d was computed as equation 16 solórzano rivas and werner 2020 found that the error in applying the ferris solution without correction to tidal propagation in circular aquifers is about 10 for inland distances of 0 2a beyond which larger errors were obtained with increasing inland distance here we extend the calculation of ferris solution errors by determining the island size for which the error in the ferris solution is 1 this was achieved using a least squares optimization technique applied to the m2 constituent λ 2 scenario and adopting inland distances where the ferris solution error is 1 of 300 m 600 m and 900 m 3 results and discussion 3 1 harmonic analysis this section presents the observed amplitude and phase lags estimated from harmonic analysis of the different synthetic times series including for both confined and unconfined aquifer conditions table 2 shows the observed tidal parameters under confined conditions that is parameters from harmonic analysis of theoretical observations a g obs and φ obs and of theoretical observations with noise a g obs and φ obs and the relative difference between them values of a g obs or a g obs lower than 2 5 cm are within the likely bounds of uncertainty of field measurements considering a pressure transducer with 50 m measuring range and accuracy of 0 05 e g in situ inc 2020 results shown in table 2 correspond to the observations at locations equal to 0 1a 0 2a and 0 3a for every tidal constituent and for the three λ scenarios specified in the base case model values in table 2 show an attenuation of a g obs and a g obs and an increase of φ obs and φ obs with distance as expected another expected outcome is the higher relative tidal efficiency a g obs a 0 and a g obs a 0 for the λ 3 scenario i e 500 000 m2 d for all tidal constituents interpretation of phase lag results needed to account for the number of cycles that have occurred at each location for reasons given earlier for example the values marked with represent phase lags requiring adjustment to add complete cycles to the phase lag estimate arising from harmonic analysis these were apparent from phase lags that did not increase monotonically with distance from the shoreline for example the phase lag reduces between 0 2a and 0 3a for the mk3 constituent λ 1 scenario because a new cycle had started prior to the wave reaching 0 3a from the shoreline the circular solution has the advantage of ignoring phase changes that were greater than a complete tidal cycle and therefore the values with the in table 2 were used without any correction for the inverse estimation of λ using the circular solution however correction through the addition of 2πk where k is the number of complete cycles that have occurred was needed to account for phase changes in applying the correction factor to the ferris solution for the estimation of λ the tidal parameters obtained using harmonic analysis of theoretical observations i e a g obs and φ obs without noise added perfectly matched e g errors 10 15 the values of a g and φ obtained from the circular solution i e applying equations 2 and 5 as expected this confirms the reliability of the harmonic analysis methodology however there were discrepancies in a g obs and φ obs i e relative to a g and φ when harmonic analysis was applied to theoretical observations with noise these discrepancies are expressed in terms of the relative errors e a and e φ given by equations 11 and 12 respectively table 2 shows that e a e φ with some exceptions i e for some cases with λ values of 350 00 and 500 000 m2 d indicating that generally harmonic analysis led to larger errors in amplitude than phase lag when analysing theoretical observations with noise the reason for this difference in errors may be associated with the fact that noise influences groundwater levels without affecting the observation time this is apparent for example in high tides in theoretical observations with noise that occur at similar times to those of theoretical observations without noise see fig 2 even though the high tide elevations differ given this it is likely that the uncertainty in amplitude exceeds that of the phase table 3 shows observed parameters i e amplitude and phase lag obtained from the harmonic analysis of unconfined aquifer observations when noise is not included namely numerical observations results from numerical observations with noise are presented in table s8 in the supplementary information table 3 shows the observed parameters a n obs and φ n obs and table s8 shows the observed parameters a n obs and φ n obs results are given at the inland locations of 0 1a 0 2a and 0 3a for the k1 constituent and all three λ scenarios tables 3 and s8 also present relative errors e a and e φ in a n obs φ n obs and a n obs φ n obs with respect to the corresponding observed parameters a g obs and φ obs to assess the effect of applying the circular solution which is formulated for confined conditions to unconfined aquifers relative errors in amplitudes and phase lags are calculated using equations 11 and 12 respectively a comparison of tables 3 and s8 shows that the errors e a and e φ are of the same order of magnitude when observations are with and without noise this implies that the noise added to the numerical observations i e of unconfined conditions did not affect markedly the values of amplitude and phase lag obtained from harmonic analysis results in tables 3 and s8 show that e a decreases with increasing λ and increases with inland distance from the shoreline on the other hand the range in e φ is smaller 0 7 to 1 1 tables 3 and s8 than the range in e a 0 7 to 3 3 tables 3 and s8 it is noteworthy that in both situations tables 3 and s8 all relative errors are negative implying that groundwater tides in unconfined aquifers experience more attenuation of tidal amplitude than in confined aquifers even though the same value of storativity was adopted in both confined and unconfined situations the reason for this outcome is a consequence of the changing transmissivity due to the time changing depth during tidal fluctuations figure s1 in the supplementary information compares the effects on groundwater tides of a time varying transmissivity due to a change in saturated depth i e unconfined conditions with the case of a time constant transmissivity i e confined conditions 3 2 sensitivity analysis values of the non dimensional local sensitivity s equation 17 of λ obtained by inversion of the circular solution to changes in a g obs and φ obs for each tidal constituent are shown in tables 4 and 5 respectively table 4 shows that the values of s a are all positive whereas s φ given in table 5 are all negative this indicates that when a g obs increases λ a also increases i e positively correlated conversely when φ obs increases λ φ decreases i e negatively correlated given that positive values of e a signify a g obs a g obs a n obs a g obs or a n obs a g obs and over estimation of a g obs leads to overestimation of λ a it follows that positive values of e a tables 2 and 3 indicate overestimation of λ a while λ a will be underestimated if e a is negative the inverse occurs for e φ see tables 2 and 3 whereby the negative values of s φ in table 5 indicate that λ φ is underestimated when e φ is positive whereas λ φ is overestimated when e φ is negative the spatial variability in s a table 4 is distinctly different to that of s φ table 5 for example s φ is relatively constant i e 2 with the exception of mk3 constituent λ 1 scenario at a distance of 0 3a table 5 while there is a decreasing trend in s a with distance from the shoreline table 4 the disparate value of s φ 0 219 in table 5 corresponds to a groundwater tidal signal for which a complete cycle had transpired this result was corroborated by estimating s φ at locations further inland than those given in table 5 in those locations the observed groundwater tide was similarly in the second or third cycle as expected and values of s φ were found to be of a similar order of magnitude to 0 219 i e the value obtained at a distance of 0 3a table 5 3 3 inverse calculation of λ applying the circular solution 3 3 1 circular solution for confined conditions the λ a and λ φ estimates confined aquifer conditions obtained through minimisation of equations 13 to 15 are given in table 6 the average of λ a and λ φ equal to λ av is also included table s1 in the supplementary information shows the relative error e r equation 16 in the λ estimates given in table 6 the values in table 6 show that estimates of λ φ are similar to λ a φ whereas these differ to λ a for example λ φ and λ a φ are both 150 830 m2 d at a distance of 0 2a for the m2 constituent λ 1 scenario which differs to λ a i e 150 492 m2 d for the same case this arises because s φ table 5 is generally higher than s a table 4 that is the higher value of s φ leads to φ obs having a more dominate role relative to a g obs in the estimation of λ a φ where there are marked differences between λ φ and λ a φ see table 6 s a s φ those situations occur for the k1 constituent in both the λ 2 and λ 3 scenarios at the location 0 1a table 6 trefry and bekele 2004 made a contrasting observation in their application of the townley 1995 straight coastline based analytical solution to tidal propagation for finite domains i e for the inverse calculation of λ that is they found that λ estimates based on both phase lag and amplitude were closer to λ values obtained from only the amplitude sensitivities of λ to changes in amplitude or phase lag were not reported in trefry and bekele 2004 the results in table 6 support the earlier assertion that positive values of e a lead to overestimation of λ a this is because s a is always positive see table 4 whereas positive values of e φ induce underestimation of λ φ for example at a distance of 0 2a for the m2 constituent λ 1 scenario λ a is overestimated i e λ a 150 000 m2 d because e a for the same case is positive i e 0 627 table 2 conversely for negative values of e a λ a is underestimated as occurs at the 0 2a distance for the mk3 constituent λ 2 scenario i e λ a 350 000 m2 d table 6 due to the negative value of e a i e 0 301 table 2 fig 3 compares the error i e e r in values of λ a λ φ λ a φ and λ av with respect to the known diffusivities in the three λ scenarios the comparison shows the three inland locations i e 0 1a 0 2a and 0 3a and the three tidal constituents k1 m2 and mk3 fig 3 shows that in most cases e r 0 6 cases where e r values are 0 6 correspond to situations leading to observed amplitudes from harmonic analysis of theoretical observations with noise i e a g obs smaller than 2 5 cm i e within limits of measurement techniques see table 2 therefore we consider cases with e r 0 6 inconsequential also the high error of e r 18 in the estimate of λ φ at the 0 3a distance for the mk3 constituent λ 1 scenario is related to the observed phase lag greater than one tidal cycle φ obs value with asterisk in table 2 the reason for this is that the associated groundwater amplitude is very small i e a g obs 3 mm table 2 therefore based only on relevant data i e a g obs 2 5 cm the circular solution reproduces the known diffusivities within 0 6 error 3 3 2 circular solution for unconfined conditions fig 4 compares the e r values in λ a λ φ λ a φ and λ av estimates based on a low frequency tidal constituent i e k1 under unconfined conditions at the three λ scenarios and at the inland locations of 0 1a 0 2a and 0 3a fig 4 presents the results derived from numerical observations left column and numerical observations with noise right column the λ estimates used to determine e r are presented in table s2 in the supporting information the results in fig 4 show that the maximum e r in the estimation of λ using both numerical observations with and without noise at the three λ scenarios is 2 2 ignoring the e r values derived from the a n obs and a n obs values smaller than 2 5 cm in tables 3 and s8 e r values for unconfined cases average e r of 1 8 for estimated values of λ a λ φ and λ a φ fig 4 are higher than those for confined cases average e r of 0 86 for estimated values of λ a λ φ and λ a φ fig 3 this difference in e r values is consistent with the difference in e a and e φ values between confined and unconfined conditions that is the obtained e a and e φ values for unconfined conditions i e tables 3 and s8 are significantly higher i e average e a of 1 8 and average e φ of 0 97 including numerical observations with and without noise than those obtained for confined conditions based on theoretical observations with noise i e average e a of 0 15 and average e φ of 0 1 table 2 a comparison between the e r values derived from numerical observations and those derived from numerical observations with noise shows that all approaches to λ estimation i e λ a λ φ λ a φ and λ av produce the same range of values regardless of whether noise is imposed or not this outcome is consistent with the harmonic analysis results observed in tables 3 and s8 where amplitudes and phase lags from numerical observations a n obs φ n obs and from numerical observations with noise a n obs φ n obs are within the same value range that is e a values in table 3 i e unconfined conditions without noise are similar to e a values in table s8 i e unconfined conditions with noise the same finding applies to the results of e φ in tables 3 and s8 fig 4 shows that the best approach to estimate λ under unconfined conditions applying the circular solution on observations with and without noise is the average approach i e λ av lightest coloured bars this is because λ a is underestimated and λ φ is overestimated in all cases see table s2 in the supporting information causing the average approach to be closer to the known value this differs from the results obtained for the confined conditions applying the circular solution for which no consistent error trend was observed that would allow for the recommendation of a specific approach i e λ a λ φ λ aφ or λ av see section 3 3 1 3 4 λ estimation applying the solórzano rivas and werner 2020 correction factor the aquifer characteristics i e island size and λ scenarios and observation distances from the shoreline used in this study lead to conditions that satisfied the requirements of γ r 2 and γ a 2 to apply the correction factor to the ferris solution e g solórzano rivas and werner 2020 for example the lowest value of γ r was 7 5 and occurred at the penetration distance of 0 2a for the k1 constituent λ 3 scenario the lowest value of γ a was 10 7 and was constant at the three locations for the k1 constituent λ 3 scenario an evaluation of the correction factor to the ferris solution was undertaken for both confined and unconfined aquifer conditions 3 4 1 application of the corrected ferris solution for confined conditions fig 5 compares the e r for the different λ estimation approaches λ af λ φf and λ avf in the three λ scenarios applying the corrected ferris solution in confined conditions results are derived from theoretical observations i e without noise the comparison shows e r values for the three inland locations i e 0 1a 0 2a and 0 3a and the three tidal constituents k1 m2 and mk3 the λ estimates used to determine e r are presented in tables s3 to s5 in the supporting information results in fig 5 show that the corrected ferris solution was able to reproduce the known diffusivities in all scenarios within 99 6 accuracy i e maximum e r is 0 37 when the estimates are based on theoretical observations i e without noise fig 5 shows a direct relationship between e r and tidal period i e estimates from larger period constituents e g k1 involve larger errors and λ i e errors increase with increasing λ i e from λ 1 scenario to λ 3 scenario it is also evident that λ avf produced the smallest e r values i e within 0 03 lightest coloured bars in fig 5 the reason for this is that λ af overestimates the known diffusivities positive e r values in tables s3 s5 whereas these are underestimated by λ φf negative e r values in tables s3 s5 this is similar to over and under estimation of λ for the unconfined conditions applying the circular solution i e section 3 3 2 leading to the lower errors occurring in λ av fig 6 present similar results to those given in fig 5 except theoretical observations with noise are used in estimating λ fig 6 shows that the corrected ferris solution reproduced the known diffusivities within 1 error i e maximum e r is 0 81 ignoring cases where amplitudes are smaller than 2 5 cm values denoted with in table 2 the only case where e r for the estimated values of λ φf i e orange bars in fig 6 exceeds 1 i e e r 18 at the 0 3a distance for the mk3 constituent λ 1 scenario is associated with the situation where the phase lag is greater than one tidal cycle i e φ obs value with asterisk in table 2 note that this large e r value is also associated with the corresponding small groundwater amplitude i e a g obs 3 mm table 2 this is a similar result i e e r 18 obtained for the same case applying the circular solution i e section 3 3 1 fig 6 shows that λ avf values applying the corrected ferris solution were not the most accurate when based on theoretical observations with noise contrary to diffusivity estimates from theoretical observations this is because λ af or λ φf based on theoretical observations with noise does not consistently overestimate or underestimate the known diffusivities as occurs with estimates derived from theoretical observations see tables s3 s5 in the supporting information we explored the errors obtained in λ estimates by the direct application of the ferris solution without the correction factor to the three λ scenarios under confined conditions and with the k1 constituent only the results show that direct application of the ferris solution without the correction factor led to higher e r values than those obtained from application of the corrected ferris solution with errors in λ af and λ avf of up to 18 and 9 respectively see results in table s7 optimization results provided estimates of island radii that lead to comparable groundwater amplitudes i e within 1 of the radial solution when applying the ferris solution without correction the m2 constituent λ 2 scenario was adopted the analysis showed that 1 errors were obtained at inland distances of 300 m 600 m and 900 m when the island radius was approximately 15 km 30 km and 45 km respectively in other words to limit the error in the ferris solution to 1 in applying it to a circular island at a measurement point at 300 m from the shoreline the island radius should be 15 km i e the radial solution is needed for island radii 15 km these results further indicate that the minimum island size to achieve a 1 error in applying the ferris solution without correction to tidal propagation in orbiculate boundaries depends on the measurement location in agreement with solórzano rivas and werner 2020 for the conditions studied i e m2 constituent λ 2 scenario minimum island radii to achieve 1 error were about 50 times the distance from the shoreline that tidal conditions were estimated noting the limit of amplitude measurability i e approximately 2 5 cm amplitude in the mk3 constituent λ 2 scenario at the 0 2a inland distance i e 600 m is 0 03 m table 2 it follows that islands up 30 km may require application of the circular solution method to limit errors due to the curved nature of the shoreline to 1 3 4 2 application of the corrected ferris solution for unconfined conditions fig 7 compares e r for the different λ estimation approaches λ af λ φf and λ avf applying the corrected ferris solution in unconfined conditions based on both numerical observations and numerical observations with noise the λ estimates used to determine e r are presented in table s6 in the supporting information results in fig 7 show that the maximum value of e r is within 2 5 of the known value when the corrected ferris solution is adopted to estimate λ in unconfined aquifer conditions regardless of whether noise is imposed or not a similar result was obtained i e up to 2 5 error with the estimation of λ applying the circular solution for unconfined conditions these results show that both the corrected ferris solution and circular solution provide similar ranges of errors in the estimation of λ including the same tendency of underestimating and overestimating λ af and λ φf respectively see table s6 the under overestimation of λ af and λ φf is why the ideal method to estimate λ under unconfined conditions applying the corrected ferris solution is the λ avf approach i e lightest coloured bars fig 7 which uses an average of λ af and λ φf and thereby under overestimations are offset the average approach is also the ideal approach in applying the circular solution to unconfined conditions for the same reason 4 conclusions the application of the circular solution for the estimation of aquifer diffusivity has been assessed for the first time given the functions that describe the circular solution the inverse problem of estimating aquifer diffusivity i e λ requires the application of iterative methods the results of this study suggest that application of the circular and corrected ferris solutions to the estimation of λ led to relative errors i e e r 1 and 2 5 for confined and unconfined conditions respectively even where noise was added to synthetic hydrographs an exception arose in estimating λ based on phase lags corresponding to more than one tidal cycle which led to high relative errors in λ estimates i e up to 18 this applied to both the circular solution and the corrected ferris solution for the cases considered large values of phase lags i e one tidal cycle occurred when the amplitude was smaller than the assumed limit of measurement techniques i e 2 5 cm thus it is unlikely that this error will be encountered in practical field conditions but nevertheless we recommend not applying the circular solution or corrected ferris solution to estimate λ where phase lags 2π or amplitudes 2 5 cm the average approach i e λ is the mean of values obtained from the amplitude decay and phase lag was found to be the most accurate technique to estimate λ applying the circular solution and the corrected ferris solution for unconfined conditions even when noise was imposed to the signal the average approach was also the best technique to estimate λ from the corrected ferris solution at least under confined conditions and without noise added to the signal there were no other cases where a specific approach consistently led to values of λ from tidal analysis closer to the known λ the results presented here suggest that the minimum island size to achieve a 1 error in applying the ferris solution without correction to tidal propagation from orbiculate boundaries depends on the measurement location for the conditions studied i e m2 constituent λ 2 scenario the minimum island radii to achieve 1 error should be about 50 times the distance from the shoreline where tidal conditions are estimated thus as a general rule the circular solution and the corrected ferris solution are the best approaches to estimate aquifer diffusivity in circular islands of radii less than several 10s of kilometres the methodologies proposed in this study extend the available tools to estimate aquifer parameters especially in circular aquifers facilitating the determination of properties that otherwise require more invasive methods such as pumping tests this is particularly advantageous for the evaluation of the aquifer properties of small

4519,observations of tidal propagation in coastal aquifers allow for rapid low cost quantification of aquifer parameters that are integrated over significant distances previous methods for aquifer property estimation from tidal propagation have focussed on continental aquifers and assumed straight infinite shorelines a recent investigation has proposed a correction to the ferris analytical solution for straight shorelines ferris solution to be applied under radial flow conditions in this paper an existing analytical solution as a function of radial flow conditions circular solution and the corrected ferris solution are applied for the first time to obtain aquifer diffusivity in orbiculate shaped islands inversion of the circular solution to obtain diffusivity requires iterative methods which are applied to synthetic island aquifers with known diffusivity values ranging between 150 000 m2 d and 500 000 m2 d the circular solution was tested for both confined and unconfined conditions and for tidal periods ranging from around 8 to 24 h known aquifer diffusivity values were reproduced within 2 5 of known values even where randomised noise was added to synthetic groundwater tidal signals and for both confined and unconfined aquifer conditions application of the corrected ferris solution was found to be reliable for both confined and unconfined conditions with discrepancies in aquifer diffusivity 1 and 2 5 respectively including with noise added to the groundwater tidal signals the methodology presented in this work to estimate aquifer diffusivity in orbiculate shaped islands is an improvement over classic approaches e g the ferris solution in particular the radial flow correction to the ferris solution provides for simple calculations of aquifer

essential to understand and predict groundwater responses to hydrologic stresses evaluating the aquifer properties of islands is particularly important because groundwater is often the only source of freshwater and the vulnerability of island aquifers to degradation from anthropogenic and environmental factors is often very high e g white and falkland 2010 werner et al 2017 for example the salinization of pumping wells on islands is common because fresh groundwater typically occurs as relatively thin lenses that float above saltwater e g werner et al 2013 mitigating water quality degradation on islands therefore requires effective water management based on reasonable estimates of aquifer properties field based estimates of aquifer hydraulic properties are commonly obtained by actually stressing the aquifer and observing its response in a given period of time for example in the form of pumping tests e g theis 1935 alternatively passive forms of aquifer testing may be undertaken such as the measurement of the fluctuations in coastal groundwater levels caused by ocean tides aquifer properties control the tidal propagation which is manifested in aquifers as attenuation in the tidal amplitude and lag in the tidal phase relative to the ocean tide extracting information about aquifer properties from tidal groundwater fluctuations was first proposed by ferris 1951 based on earlier work by jacob 1950 compared to pumping tests tidal aquifer testing requires significantly less infrastructure and in most circumstances provides integrated knowledge i e spatially averages of aquifer properties over larger scales than can feasibly be obtained from pumping tests the analytical solution hereafter referred to as the circular solution to periodic radial flow within circular homogeneous aquifers first appeared in the report of williams et al 1970 and was subsequently analysed by townley 1995 who expressed the mathematical solution in terms of modified bessel functions e g abramowitz and stegun 1965 williams et al 1970 derived the solution through application of kelvin functions e g abramowitz and stegun 1965 despite the different functions used the two solutions are equivalent the circular solution has not been applied previously to determine aquifer properties i e of islands whereas the ferris solution is used routinely in the estimation of aquifer hydraulic diffusivity e g jha et al 2003 banerjee et al 2008 zhou 2008 rotzoll et al 2013 chattopadhyay et al 2014 xun et al 2015 aquifer hydraulic diffusivity λ l2 t 1 is defined by λ t s where t is transmissivity l2 t 1 and s is storativity the ferris solution has the advantage of allowing direct calculation of λ whereas the circular solution requires iterative methods to obtain λ from tidal signals solórzano rivas and werner 2020 recently compared the circular solution to the widely used analytical solution of ferris 1951 hereafter the ferris solution which applies to straight coastlines solórzano rivas and werner 2020 demonstrated that application of the ferris solution to tidal propagation in curved boundaries may be valid within 10 error for distances from the shoreline of up to about 20 of the island radius however it may incur errors of up to 80 towards the island centre they also provided a relationship between the ferris and circular solutions for the estimation of tidal amplitude decay and phase shift and adopted this as a correction factor to the ferris solution previous studies indicate that values of λ inferred from field based observations of groundwater tidal amplitude differ to λ values obtained from field based phase lag observations e g ferris 1951 smith 1999 rotzoll et al 2008 2013 trefry and bekele 2004 used numerical modelling to identify different possible reasons for discrepancies between λ values obtained from the amplitude and phase for instance they tested different scenarios to represent a range of simplified real world factors such as unconfined flow density dependent flow anisotropic aquifer properties boundary geometry variability and aquifer heterogeneity they found that among the different explored processes the dominant cause of inconsistent λ values between amplitude based and phase lag based predictions was aquifer heterogeneity specifically they found that layering variation in hydraulic conductivity with depth adopting a high k bottom layer and a low k top layer caused the largest discrepancy in λ estimates inferred from tidal amplitude and phase lag values the above complexities of real world settings are potential sources of noise in groundwater tides which add to the challenges of extracting parameter estimates from tide based approaches the objective of the present work is to demonstrate and critically assess the application of the circular solution to the estimation of aquifer hydraulic properties i e λ of orbiculate islands the analysis is divided into four parts that reflect the study objectives 1 the method is applied to a complex groundwater tide created by the effects of multiple ocean tide constituents the resulting multi constituent i e compound groundwater tide is produced by applying the circular solution and assuming superposition 2 a sensitivity analysis is undertaken to assess relationships between the predicted λ value and the tidal characteristics i e amplitude and phase 3 the solórzano rivas and werner 2020 correction factor to the ferris solution to allow its application to circular islands for estimating λ is evaluated as a replacement to the circular solution 4 the circular solution devised for confined aquifer conditions is tested for applicability to unconfined aquifer conditions 2 methods 2 1 circular solution to tidal propagation tidal propagation in a homogeneous isotropic circular aquifer i e an orbiculate shaped island can be resolved by solving the one dimensional axisymmetric groundwater flow equation with tidal boundary conditions in radial coordinates williams et al 1970 townley 1995 solórzano rivas and werner 2020 here the aquifer is assumed to be confined and of uniform geometry most island aquifers containing freshwater are likely to be unconfined especially for small to medium islands e g werner et al 2017 thus the application of the confined aquifer solution to unconfined aquifers is an approximation which we evaluate fig 1 shows a schematic island cross section in radial coordinates subject to a tidal force at the seaward boundary the circular solution described by solórzano rivas and werner 2020

constituents m2 s2 n2 k1 k2 p1 and o1 account for more than approximately 80 of real world tides kvale 2012 in this study a synthetic compound tide created as the sum of three tidal constituents is used for the shoreline boundary condition as outlined in table 1 constituent 1 is the oceanic semidiurnal lunar tide m2 tidal period τ 12 42 h m2 is the principal tidal constituent in oceanic tides with the largest amplitude tidal potential doodson 1954 constituent 2 is the lunar solar diurnal principal constituent k1 τ 23 93 h and constituent 3 is the compound tide mk3 that arises from the combination of m2 and k1 when they pass through shallow water depths e g luick 2004 mk3 is adopted because the amplitude and velocity of ocean tides are disturbed in shallow sea depths due to the friction effects thereby altering the otherwise simple harmonic characteristics of the tides that occur in deeper waters e g godin 1972 these effects can be treated as the appearance of new harmonics of the original frequency defined as shallow water tides e g gallagher and munk 1971 godin 1972 stewart 2008 godin 1972 recommended as normal practice the inclusion of shallow water constituents in the analysis of tides that reach the coastline because they are always present in seawater bodies of shallow depth including estuaries and bays as long as these are hydraulically connected to the ocean this approach is an improvement over previous studies that test tidal propagation methods because these almost exclusively neglect shallow water tides 2 3 tidal propagation observed groundwater tides a base case model was developed for a hypothetical small island of a 3000 m and three scenarios were considered to represent different values of λ i e λ 1 150 000 m2 d λ 2 350 000 m2 d and λ 3 500 000 m2 d these values are within the normal range of t s found for real islands e g trefry and bekele 2004 cabrera and custodio 2004 the circular solution was then applied to create data i e synthetic tidal groundwater hydrographs that we treat as surrogates for field observations using these parameters observed data were produced at three inland locations namely at distances from the shoreline equal to 10 20 and 30 of the island radius i e 0 1a 0 2a and 0 3a for both confined and unconfined conditions the circular solution was used to create compound tidal conditions through the application of superposition whereby compound oceanic tides are taken as the sum of individual constituents i e m2 k1 and mk3 superposition applies to confined aquifer problems because of linearity in the relevant theory whereas tidal propagation in unconfined aquifers is non linear although it is common practice to linearise unconfined groundwater flow for mathematical convenience bear 1979 the application of the circular solution and superposition to the propagation of a compound tidal signal was firstly compared to the results of confined aquifer numerical simulations to confirm the methodology similar to the verification undertaken by solórzano rivas and werner 2020 for a single tide numerical modelling adopted a version of seawat modified by post 2011 to allow the simulation of tidal boundary conditions namely through implementation of the periodic boundary condition pbc package and the methodology described by langevin 2008 to adjust the input parameters of seawat to represent radial flow coordinates the pbc package allows the user to define a multiple constituent tide at the shoreline boundary comparison between the numerical model and the analytical solution showed an excellent match as expected for example at the distance from the shoreline equal to 0 3a and the λ 2 scenario i e 350 000 m2 d the root mean square error rmse was 0 004 m see table 1 for tidal amplitudes solórzano rivas and werner 2020 showed the same good agreement between analytical and numerical results using seawat post 2011 when only one tidal constituent was used numerical models using seawat post 2011 were used to create tidal propagation in unconfined conditions for which superposition does not strictly apply thereby restricting the application of superposition in assessments of compound tides based on analytical solutions the same three λ scenarios i e 150 000 m2 d 350 000 m2 d and 500 000 m2 d used with confined conditions were analysed in the numerical modelling of unconfined aquifers unconfined simulations involved tidal variations in the aquifer thickness which creates fluctuations in t while storativity remains time invariant we adopted the same storativity in both unconfined and confined numerical models even though specific yield in unconfined aquifers is typically several orders of magnitude higher than the storativity of confined aquifers to isolate the effects of tidal depth changes on the application of the circular solution to unconfined conditions to reproduce those three λ scenarios in a fluctuating water table the numerical model was designed so the time averaged aquifer thickness over one tide period is 10 m considering that the model bottom elevation is 10 m the top model elevation is 2 m and mean sea level has an elevation of 0 m however unconfined aquifer simulations to generate observed groundwater tides adopted a monochromatic tidal signal using only the k1 constituent which travelled further into the unconfined aquifer due to its lower tidal frequency f table 1 than the other higher frequency tides this led to groundwater tidal amplitudes that were higher than the minimum threshold for field measurement with a standard water level logger i e a 1 cm at the three inland locations and three λ scenarios for example groundwater amplitudes from the tidal constituent m2 and the largest diffusivity scenario i e 500 000 m2 d were 1 5 mm at the three locations results shown at table s9 in the supplementary information the observations of synthetic groundwater tides obtained through application of the radial analytical solution to the three inland locations are termed theoretical observations hereafter the groundwater tides obtained from numerical modelling are described as numerical observations field measurements of coastal groundwater tides invariably show the influence of non tidal factors due to for example time variant recharge and pumping spatial heterogeneity measurement error and aquifer geometry variability e g erskine 1991 to reflect these departures from the idealised sinusoidal signals inherent in theoretical and numerical observations random noise was added to these otherwise idealised signals the resulting new sets of observed data are referred to as theoretical observations with noise and numerical observations with noise noise was generated in two steps first a random uniform distribution over the range 0 025 m to 0 025 m was created to represent device error and other complications in the measurement process based on typical pressure transducer error adopting 50 m of measuring range and accuracy of 0 05 in situ inc 2020 a second set of random values was generated using a normal distribution of mean equal to 0 00 m and standard deviation of 0 01 m to emulate other complicating factors on groundwater levels the two random error time series were then added to theoretical and numerical observations while the choice of noise parameters is effectively arbitrary the noise statistical properties selected here produced synthetic groundwater tides that appear from visual inspection as roughly similar to real world groundwater hydrographs e g merritt 2004 xun et al 2006 fig 2 shows an example of two hypothetical groundwater tides based on theoretical observations and theoretical observations with noise 2 4 harmonic analysis harmonic analysis of synthetic groundwater tides was undertaken to obtain observed groundwater amplitudes and phase lags e g fig 2 for every tidal component i e the m2 k1 and mk3 constituents this was achieved using discrete linear least squares estimation lse e g kay 1993 amplitudes and phase lags from theoretical observations are denoted as a g obs and φ obs respectively corresponding parameters for other synthetic time series include a g obs and φ obs theoretical observations with noise a n obs and φ n obs numerical observations and a n obs and φ n obs numerical observations with noise lse presumes that the observed groundwater tides can be described by e g boon and kiley 1978 6 y t j 1 n a g j cos ω j t φ o b s j π 2 t 0 δ t 2 δ t n 1 δ t where y is the groundwater level l with respect to msl j is the tidal constituent n is the total of tidal constituents analysed i e n 3 and n is the total number of data points such that n ts δt where ts and δt are the total simulation time and sampling time step respectively δt was set to 30 min equation 6 adopts a cosine function and subtracts π 2 from the argument rather than the sine function of equation 1 to conform with the approach of boon and kiley 1978 while the formulations presented in this section are expressed as functions of a g obs and φ obs the same harmonic analysis was applied to obtain a g obs φ obs a n obs φ n obs and a n obs φ n obs a convenient way to express equation 6 for lse procedures is as follows 7 y t j 1 n α 1 j cos ω j t j 1 n α 2 j sin ω j t t 0 δ t 2 δ t n 1 δ t here α 1 j a g obs j cos φ o b s j π 2 and α 2 j a g obs j sin φ o b s j π 2 equation 7 can be expressed in matrix notation represented by bold fonts as y h θ where h is a matrix of dimensions n 2n composed of the sine and cosine terms in equation 7 and θ is the least squares approximation of α 1 j and α 2 j with dimensions 2n 1 that can be computed as e g kay 1993 8 θ h t h 1 h t y where the superscripts t and 1 in equation 8 indicate the matrix transpose and inverse respectively then the observed tidal parameters a g obs and φ obs can be estimated as 9 a g obs j α 1 j 2 α 2 j 2 10 φ obs j tan 1 α 2 j α 1 j π 2 given the form of equation 10 φ obs does not increase monotonically with distance as occurs in reality rather phase lags 2π are output as φ obs 2π this differs from the ferris solution whereby the phase lag increases monotonically with distance as expected although this has no implications for the inverse problem of estimating λ using the circular solution it affects λ estimation from the corrected ferris solution which requires the complete phase lag that is we account for the number of tidal cycles that have transpired in estimating λ using the corrected ferris solution where the phase lag exceeds a tidal cycle i e φ obs 2π it is expected that the observed groundwater amplitudes and phase lags obtained from harmonic analysis of theoretical observations with noise and numerical observations both with and without noise i e a g obs φ obs a n obs φ n obs and a n obs φ n obs will show some departures from the corresponding theoretical observations a g obs and φ obs these departures were estimated and expressed as relative errors as follows 11 e a a g o b s a g o b s a g o b s 100 12 e φ φ o b s φ o b s φ o b s 100 equations 11 and 12 also apply for discrepancies between a n obs φ n obs a n obs φ n obs and the corresponding a g obs and φ obs values 2 5 determination of λ through application of the circular solution in the case of the circular solution λ can only be determined through iterative methods since t and s are part of the argument γ of the modified bessel functions see equations 2 and 3 which cannot be directly inverted here an optimization technique is used namely the nelder mead simplex method nelder and mead 1965 which is applied within the algorithm implemented in the python function scipy optimize fmin parameter estimation is performed by the minimisation of two objective functions o a λ a and o p λ φ which represent discrepancies between model estimated and observed diffusivity values of the tidal amplitude λ a and phase lag λ φ respectively the objective functions are given by 13 o a λ a a g o b s a g 2 14 o p λ φ φ o b s φ 2 where a g obs and φ obs are obtained through harmonic analysis section 2 4 and a g and φ are the values obtained from equations 2 and 5 respectively we first verified that the two objective functions given in equations 13 and 14 provide the same λ values as the original values used in the base case model that generated the synthetic observations see section 2 3 this was undertaken initially on theoretical observations i e without noise to provide a check on our implementation of the methodology and equations to determine λ a perfect match was obtained e g errors 10 8 thereby affirming the technique for ideal measurement datasets the use of tidal parameters based on theoretical observations with noise i e a g obs and φ obs is expected to lead to differences in the calculations of λ a and λ φ i e from inversion due to the influence of noise as discussed earlier in addition to objective functions based only on amplitude or phase lag misfit i e equation 13 and equation 14 respectively a multi objective function was tested to explore values of λ that arise by combining both amplitude and phase lag misfit the multi objective function was determined as 15 o a p λ a φ a g o b s a g 2 φ o b s φ 2 note that the amplitude and phase misfits are weighted equally in o a p λ a φ following the approach of trefry and bekele 2004 in this study the three objective functions i e equations 13 14 and 15 are applied to estimate λ namely when observed parameters amplitude and phase lags are extracted from observations theoretical and numerical with noise the average diffusivity λ av λ a λ φ 2 was also computed the relative error e r with respect to the known λ value and identified as λ specified adopted in creating synthetic observations in the three scenarios studied i e 150 000 m2 d 350 000 m2 d and 500 000 m2 d was then calculated as 16 e r λ a λ s p e c i f i e d λ s p e c i f i e d 100 e r values that apply to alternative methods for estimating λ were obtained by substituting λ φ λ a φ and λ av into equation 16 2 6 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the sensitivity of diffusivity i e λ a and λ φ to differences in a g obs and φ obs to explore the effect of discrepancies in a g obs φ obs a n obs φ n obs a n obs or φ n obs on the estimation of λ synthetic observations did not incorporate any noise the following discrete form for non dimensional local sensitivity e g robinson and werner 2017 was adopted 17 s p δ o o δ p here s is the non dimensional local sensitivity p is the input parameter i e a g obs or φ obs o is the output parameter i e λ a or λ φ and δ represents a discrete change applying a central finite difference approximation and assuming that δ δ p p equation 17 can be written as 18 s o p δ p o p δ p 2 o δ in this study a value of δ of 0 005 0 5 was adopted 2 7 application of the solórzano rivas and werner 2020 correction factor solórzano rivas and werner 2020 found that when the aquifer properties lead to magnitudes of γ r 2 and γ a 2 φ φ f and a g a g f a r where a gf and φ f are the amplitude tide and phase lag respectively estimated by the ferris solution this allows for the application of the solórzano rivas and werner 2020 correction factor to the ferris solution which provides for a simpler calculation of λ whereby amplitude based and phase lag based estimates of λ i e λ af and λ φf respectively are as follows 19 λ a f ω r a 2 2 l n a g o b s r a 0 a 2 20 λ φ f ω a r 2 2 φ o b s 2 the average diffusivity λ avf λ af λ φf 2 is also included as an additional approach to λ estimation to assess the correction factor applicability the relative errors between the different approaches i e λ af λφf λ avf and the specified λ in the three λ scenarios i e 150 000 m2 d 350 000 m2 d and 500 000 m2 d was computed as equation 16 solórzano rivas and werner 2020 found that the error in applying the ferris solution without correction to tidal propagation in circular aquifers is about 10 for inland distances of 0 2a beyond which larger errors were obtained with increasing inland distance here we extend the calculation of ferris solution errors by determining the island size for which the error in the ferris solution is 1 this was achieved using a least squares optimization technique applied to the m2 constituent λ 2 scenario and adopting inland distances where the ferris solution error is 1 of 300 m 600 m and 900 m 3 results and discussion 3 1 harmonic analysis this section presents the observed amplitude and phase lags estimated from harmonic analysis of the different synthetic times series including for both confined and unconfined aquifer conditions table 2 shows the observed tidal parameters under confined conditions that is parameters from harmonic analysis of theoretical observations a g obs and φ obs and of theoretical observations with noise a g obs and φ obs and the relative difference between them values of a g obs or a g obs lower than 2 5 cm are within the likely bounds of uncertainty of field measurements considering a pressure transducer with 50 m measuring range and accuracy of 0 05 e g in situ inc 2020 results shown in table 2 correspond to the observations at locations equal to 0 1a 0 2a and 0 3a for every tidal constituent and for the three λ scenarios specified in the base case model values in table 2 show an attenuation of a g obs and a g obs and an increase of φ obs and φ obs with distance as expected another expected outcome is the higher relative tidal efficiency a g obs a 0 and a g obs a 0 for the λ 3 scenario i e 500 000 m2 d for all tidal constituents interpretation of phase lag results needed to account for the number of cycles that have occurred at each location for reasons given earlier for example the values marked with represent phase lags requiring adjustment to add complete cycles to the phase lag estimate arising from harmonic analysis these were apparent from phase lags that did not increase monotonically with distance from the shoreline for example the phase lag reduces between 0 2a and 0 3a for the mk3 constituent λ 1 scenario because a new cycle had started prior to the wave reaching 0 3a from the shoreline the circular solution has the advantage of ignoring phase changes that were greater than a complete tidal cycle and therefore the values with the in table 2 were used without any correction for the inverse estimation of λ using the circular solution however correction through the addition of 2πk where k is the number of complete cycles that have occurred was needed to account for phase changes in applying the correction factor to the ferris solution for the estimation of λ the tidal parameters obtained using harmonic analysis of theoretical observations i e a g obs and φ obs without noise added perfectly matched e g errors 10 15 the values of a g and φ obtained from the circular solution i e applying equations 2 and 5 as expected this confirms the reliability of the harmonic analysis methodology however there were discrepancies in a g obs and φ obs i e relative to a g and φ when harmonic analysis was applied to theoretical observations with noise these discrepancies are expressed in terms of the relative errors e a and e φ given by equations 11 and 12 respectively table 2 shows that e a e φ with some exceptions i e for some cases with λ values of 350 00 and 500 000 m2 d indicating that generally harmonic analysis led to larger errors in amplitude than phase lag when analysing theoretical observations with noise the reason for this difference in errors may be associated with the fact that noise influences groundwater levels without affecting the observation time this is apparent for example in high tides in theoretical observations with noise that occur at similar times to those of theoretical observations without noise see fig 2 even though the high tide elevations differ given this it is likely that the uncertainty in amplitude exceeds that of the phase table 3 shows observed parameters i e amplitude and phase lag obtained from the harmonic analysis of unconfined aquifer observations when noise is not included namely numerical observations results from numerical observations with noise are presented in table s8 in the supplementary information table 3 shows the observed parameters a n obs and φ n obs and table s8 shows the observed parameters a n obs and φ n obs results are given at the inland locations of 0 1a 0 2a and 0 3a for the k1 constituent and all three λ scenarios tables 3 and s8 also present relative errors e a and e φ in a n obs φ n obs and a n obs φ n obs with respect to the corresponding observed parameters a g obs and φ obs to assess the effect of applying the circular solution which is formulated for confined conditions to unconfined aquifers relative errors in amplitudes and phase lags are calculated using equations 11 and 12 respectively a comparison of tables 3 and s8 shows that the errors e a and e φ are of the same order of magnitude when observations are with and without noise this implies that the noise added to the numerical observations i e of unconfined conditions did not affect markedly the values of amplitude and phase lag obtained from harmonic analysis results in tables 3 and s8 show that e a decreases with increasing λ and increases with inland distance from the shoreline on the other hand the range in e φ is smaller 0 7 to 1 1 tables 3 and s8 than the range in e a 0 7 to 3 3 tables 3 and s8 it is noteworthy that in both situations tables 3 and s8 all relative errors are negative implying that groundwater tides in unconfined aquifers experience more attenuation of tidal amplitude than in confined aquifers even though the same value of storativity was adopted in both confined and unconfined situations the reason for this outcome is a consequence of the changing transmissivity due to the time changing depth during tidal fluctuations figure s1 in the supplementary information compares the effects on groundwater tides of a time varying transmissivity due to a change in saturated depth i e unconfined conditions with the case of a time constant transmissivity i e confined conditions 3 2 sensitivity analysis values of the non dimensional local sensitivity s equation 17 of λ obtained by inversion of the circular solution to changes in a g obs and φ obs for each tidal constituent are shown in tables 4 and 5 respectively table 4 shows that the values of s a are all positive whereas s φ given in table 5 are all negative this indicates that when a g obs increases λ a also increases i e positively correlated conversely when φ obs increases λ φ decreases i e negatively correlated given that positive values of e a signify a g obs a g obs a n obs a g obs or a n obs a g obs and over estimation of a g obs leads to overestimation of λ a it follows that positive values of e a tables 2 and 3 indicate overestimation of λ a while λ a will be underestimated if e a is negative the inverse occurs for e φ see tables 2 and 3 whereby the negative values of s φ in table 5 indicate that λ φ is underestimated when e φ is positive whereas λ φ is overestimated when e φ is negative the spatial variability in s a table 4 is distinctly different to that of s φ table 5 for example s φ is relatively constant i e 2 with the exception of mk3 constituent λ 1 scenario at a distance of 0 3a table 5 while there is a decreasing trend in s a with distance from the shoreline table 4 the disparate value of s φ 0 219 in table 5 corresponds to a groundwater tidal signal for which a complete cycle had transpired this result was corroborated by estimating s φ at locations further inland than those given in table 5 in those locations the observed groundwater tide was similarly in the second or third cycle as expected and values of s φ were found to be of a similar order of magnitude to 0 219 i e the value obtained at a distance of 0 3a table 5 3 3 inverse calculation of λ applying the circular solution 3 3 1 circular solution for confined conditions the λ a and λ φ estimates confined aquifer conditions obtained through minimisation of equations 13 to 15 are given in table 6 the average of λ a and λ φ equal to λ av is also included table s1 in the supplementary information shows the relative error e r equation 16 in the λ estimates given in table 6 the values in table 6 show that estimates of λ φ are similar to λ a φ whereas these differ to λ a for example λ φ and λ a φ are both 150 830 m2 d at a distance of 0 2a for the m2 constituent λ 1 scenario which differs to λ a i e 150 492 m2 d for the same case this arises because s φ table 5 is generally higher than s a table 4 that is the higher value of s φ leads to φ obs having a more dominate role relative to a g obs in the estimation of λ a φ where there are marked differences between λ φ and λ a φ see table 6 s a s φ those situations occur for the k1 constituent in both the λ 2 and λ 3 scenarios at the location 0 1a table 6 trefry and bekele 2004 made a contrasting observation in their application of the townley 1995 straight coastline based analytical solution to tidal propagation for finite domains i e for the inverse calculation of λ that is they found that λ estimates based on both phase lag and amplitude were closer to λ values obtained from only the amplitude sensitivities of λ to changes in amplitude or phase lag were not reported in trefry and bekele 2004 the results in table 6 support the earlier assertion that positive values of e a lead to overestimation of λ a this is because s a is always positive see table 4 whereas positive values of e φ induce underestimation of λ φ for example at a distance of 0 2a for the m2 constituent λ 1 scenario λ a is overestimated i e λ a 150 000 m2 d because e a for the same case is positive i e 0 627 table 2 conversely for negative values of e a λ a is underestimated as occurs at the 0 2a distance for the mk3 constituent λ 2 scenario i e λ a 350 000 m2 d table 6 due to the negative value of e a i e 0 301 table 2 fig 3 compares the error i e e r in values of λ a λ φ λ a φ and λ av with respect to the known diffusivities in the three λ scenarios the comparison shows the three inland locations i e 0 1a 0 2a and 0 3a and the three tidal constituents k1 m2 and mk3 fig 3 shows that in most cases e r 0 6 cases where e r values are 0 6 correspond to situations leading to observed amplitudes from harmonic analysis of theoretical observations with noise i e a g obs smaller than 2 5 cm i e within limits of measurement techniques see table 2 therefore we consider cases with e r 0 6 inconsequential also the high error of e r 18 in the estimate of λ φ at the 0 3a distance for the mk3 constituent λ 1 scenario is related to the observed phase lag greater than one tidal cycle φ obs value with asterisk in table 2 the reason for this is that the associated groundwater amplitude is very small i e a g obs 3 mm table 2 therefore based only on relevant data i e a g obs 2 5 cm the circular solution reproduces the known diffusivities within 0 6 error 3 3 2 circular solution for unconfined conditions fig 4 compares the e r values in λ a λ φ λ a φ and λ av estimates based on a low frequency tidal constituent i e k1 under unconfined conditions at the three λ scenarios and at the inland locations of 0 1a 0 2a and 0 3a fig 4 presents the results derived from numerical observations left column and numerical observations with noise right column the λ estimates used to determine e r are presented in table s2 in the supporting information the results in fig 4 show that the maximum e r in the estimation of λ using both numerical observations with and without noise at the three λ scenarios is 2 2 ignoring the e r values derived from the a n obs and a n obs values smaller than 2 5 cm in tables 3 and s8 e r values for unconfined cases average e r of 1 8 for estimated values of λ a λ φ and λ a φ fig 4 are higher than those for confined cases average e r of 0 86 for estimated values of λ a λ φ and λ a φ fig 3 this difference in e r values is consistent with the difference in e a and e φ values between confined and unconfined conditions that is the obtained e a and e φ values for unconfined conditions i e tables 3 and s8 are significantly higher i e average e a of 1 8 and average e φ of 0 97 including numerical observations with and without noise than those obtained for confined conditions based on theoretical observations with noise i e average e a of 0 15 and average e φ of 0 1 table 2 a comparison between the e r values derived from numerical observations and those derived from numerical observations with noise shows that all approaches to λ estimation i e λ a λ φ λ a φ and λ av produce the same range of values regardless of whether noise is imposed or not this outcome is consistent with the harmonic analysis results observed in tables 3 and s8 where amplitudes and phase lags from numerical observations a n obs φ n obs and from numerical observations with noise a n obs φ n obs are within the same value range that is e a values in table 3 i e unconfined conditions without noise are similar to e a values in table s8 i e unconfined conditions with noise the same finding applies to the results of e φ in tables 3 and s8 fig 4 shows that the best approach to estimate λ under unconfined conditions applying the circular solution on observations with and without noise is the average approach i e λ av lightest coloured bars this is because λ a is underestimated and λ φ is overestimated in all cases see table s2 in the supporting information causing the average approach to be closer to the known value this differs from the results obtained for the confined conditions applying the circular solution for which no consistent error trend was observed that would allow for the recommendation of a specific approach i e λ a λ φ λ aφ or λ av see section 3 3 1 3 4 λ estimation applying the solórzano rivas and werner 2020 correction factor the aquifer characteristics i e island size and λ scenarios and observation distances from the shoreline used in this study lead to conditions that satisfied the requirements of γ r 2 and γ a 2 to apply the correction factor to the ferris solution e g solórzano rivas and werner 2020 for example the lowest value of γ r was 7 5 and occurred at the penetration distance of 0 2a for the k1 constituent λ 3 scenario the lowest value of γ a was 10 7 and was constant at the three locations for the k1 constituent λ 3 scenario an evaluation of the correction factor to the ferris solution was undertaken for both confined and unconfined aquifer conditions 3 4 1 application of the corrected ferris solution for confined conditions fig 5 compares the e r for the different λ estimation approaches λ af λ φf and λ avf in the three λ scenarios applying the corrected ferris solution in confined conditions results are derived from theoretical observations i e without noise the comparison shows e r values for the three inland locations i e 0 1a 0 2a and 0 3a and the three tidal constituents k1 m2 and mk3 the λ estimates used to determine e r are presented in tables s3 to s5 in the supporting information results in fig 5 show that the corrected ferris solution was able to reproduce the known diffusivities in all scenarios within 99 6 accuracy i e maximum e r is 0 37 when the estimates are based on theoretical observations i e without noise fig 5 shows a direct relationship between e r and tidal period i e estimates from larger period constituents e g k1 involve larger errors and λ i e errors increase with increasing λ i e from λ 1 scenario to λ 3 scenario it is also evident that λ avf produced the smallest e r values i e within 0 03 lightest coloured bars in fig 5 the reason for this is that λ af overestimates the known diffusivities positive e r values in tables s3 s5 whereas these are underestimated by λ φf negative e r values in tables s3 s5 this is similar to over and under estimation of λ for the unconfined conditions applying the circular solution i e section 3 3 2 leading to the lower errors occurring in λ av fig 6 present similar results to those given in fig 5 except theoretical observations with noise are used in estimating λ fig 6 shows that the corrected ferris solution reproduced the known diffusivities within 1 error i e maximum e r is 0 81 ignoring cases where amplitudes are smaller than 2 5 cm values denoted with in table 2 the only case where e r for the estimated values of λ φf i e orange bars in fig 6 exceeds 1 i e e r 18 at the 0 3a distance for the mk3 constituent λ 1 scenario is associated with the situation where the phase lag is greater than one tidal cycle i e φ obs value with asterisk in table 2 note that this large e r value is also associated with the corresponding small groundwater amplitude i e a g obs 3 mm table 2 this is a similar result i e e r 18 obtained for the same case applying the circular solution i e section 3 3 1 fig 6 shows that λ avf values applying the corrected ferris solution were not the most accurate when based on theoretical observations with noise contrary to diffusivity estimates from theoretical observations this is because λ af or λ φf based on theoretical observations with noise does not consistently overestimate or underestimate the known diffusivities as occurs with estimates derived from theoretical observations see tables s3 s5 in the supporting information we explored the errors obtained in λ estimates by the direct application of the ferris solution without the correction factor to the three λ scenarios under confined conditions and with the k1 constituent only the results show that direct application of the ferris solution without the correction factor led to higher e r values than those obtained from application of the corrected ferris solution with errors in λ af and λ avf of up to 18 and 9 respectively see results in table s7 optimization results provided estimates of island radii that lead to comparable groundwater amplitudes i e within 1 of the radial solution when applying the ferris solution without correction the m2 constituent λ 2 scenario was adopted the analysis showed that 1 errors were obtained at inland distances of 300 m 600 m and 900 m when the island radius was approximately 15 km 30 km and 45 km respectively in other words to limit the error in the ferris solution to 1 in applying it to a circular island at a measurement point at 300 m from the shoreline the island radius should be 15 km i e the radial solution is needed for island radii 15 km these results further indicate that the minimum island size to achieve a 1 error in applying the ferris solution without correction to tidal propagation in orbiculate boundaries depends on the measurement location in agreement with solórzano rivas and werner 2020 for the conditions studied i e m2 constituent λ 2 scenario minimum island radii to achieve 1 error were about 50 times the distance from the shoreline that tidal conditions were estimated noting the limit of amplitude measurability i e approximately 2 5 cm amplitude in the mk3 constituent λ 2 scenario at the 0 2a inland distance i e 600 m is 0 03 m table 2 it follows that islands up 30 km may require application of the circular solution method to limit errors due to the curved nature of the shoreline to 1 3 4 2 application of the corrected ferris solution for unconfined conditions fig 7 compares e r for the different λ estimation approaches λ af λ φf and λ avf applying the corrected ferris solution in unconfined conditions based on both numerical observations and numerical observations with noise the λ estimates used to determine e r are presented in table s6 in the supporting information results in fig 7 show that the maximum value of e r is within 2 5 of the known value when the corrected ferris solution is adopted to estimate λ in unconfined aquifer conditions regardless of whether noise is imposed or not a similar result was obtained i e up to 2 5 error with the estimation of λ applying the circular solution for unconfined conditions these results show that both the corrected ferris solution and circular solution provide similar ranges of errors in the estimation of λ including the same tendency of underestimating and overestimating λ af and λ φf respectively see table s6 the under overestimation of λ af and λ φf is why the ideal method to estimate λ under unconfined conditions applying the corrected ferris solution is the λ avf approach i e lightest coloured bars fig 7 which uses an average of λ af and λ φf and thereby under overestimations are offset the average approach is also the ideal approach in applying the circular solution to unconfined conditions for the same reason 4 conclusions the application of the circular solution for the estimation of aquifer diffusivity has been assessed for the first time given the functions that describe the circular solution the inverse problem of estimating aquifer diffusivity i e λ requires the application of iterative methods the results of this study suggest that application of the circular and corrected ferris solutions to the estimation of λ led to relative errors i e e r 1 and 2 5 for confined and unconfined conditions respectively even where noise was added to synthetic hydrographs an exception arose in estimating λ based on phase lags corresponding to more than one tidal cycle which led to high relative errors in λ estimates i e up to 18 this applied to both the circular solution and the corrected ferris solution for the cases considered large values of phase lags i e one tidal cycle occurred when the amplitude was smaller than the assumed limit of measurement techniques i e 2 5 cm thus it is unlikely that this error will be encountered in practical field conditions but nevertheless we recommend not applying the circular solution or corrected ferris solution to estimate λ where phase lags 2π or amplitudes 2 5 cm the average approach i e λ is the mean of values obtained from the amplitude decay and phase lag was found to be the most accurate technique to estimate λ applying the circular solution and the corrected ferris solution for unconfined conditions even when noise was imposed to the signal the average approach was also the best technique to estimate λ from the corrected ferris solution at least under confined conditions and without noise added to the signal there were no other cases where a specific approach consistently led to values of λ from tidal analysis closer to the known λ the results presented here suggest that the minimum island size to achieve a 1 error in applying the ferris solution without correction to tidal propagation from orbiculate boundaries depends on the measurement location for the conditions studied i e m2 constituent λ 2 scenario the minimum island radii to achieve 1 error should be about 50 times the distance from the shoreline where tidal conditions are estimated thus as a general rule the circular solution and the corrected ferris solution are the best approaches to estimate aquifer diffusivity in circular islands of radii less than several 10s of kilometres the methodologies proposed in this study extend the available tools to estimate aquifer parameters especially in circular aquifers facilitating the determination of properties that otherwise require more invasive methods such as pumping tests this is particularly advantageous for the evaluation of the aquifer properties of small islands given the ease with which tidal data can be obtained credit authorship contribution statement s c solórzano rivas methodology software investigation formal analysis visualization writing
