11590,water is the most limiting factor for grain yield of different crop species in the arid and semi arid regions in iran eminency of water shortage has added fuel to the craving for finding water efficient alternative crops or introducing water saving procedures to the production systems a 2 year field study with two irrigation regimes drought versus drought free control two levels of proline application 0 and 20mm and 11 fennel genotypes was carried out to determine the interactive effects of water supply proline and genotype on the essential oil and grain yield yield components water use efficiency wue and some physiological traits of fennel drought stress led to modifications in the activities of catalase cat ascorbate peroxidase apx and peroxidase pox and decreases in chlorophyll chl concentration umbels plant 1000 grains weight grains m2 these drought induced modifications in latter traits resulted in decreases in grain yield essential oil yield harvest index and wue in all genotypes but the extent of the decreases differed among genotypes effect of exogenous proline on different traits was dependent on water condition and genotype but it led to increases in 1000 grains weight grain and essential oil yield and wue of a number of genotypes irrespective of water condition the presented data suggests that some fennel genotypes are drought tolerant and exogenously applied proline is a procedure capable to decrease the number of irrigations and increase grain essential oil yield and wue of this medicinal plant keywords antioxidants drought tolerance foeniculum vulgare medicinal plant yield 1 introduction drought episodes are expected to get heightened in frequency and intensity in the face of global climate change water shortage is predicted to pose greater pressure on agricultural production systems than in the past indeed meeting the future demand of food production seems exceedingly challenging given the fact that the ever growing demand for urban and industrial water expansion and perhaps maintaining current quotient of irrigation is questionable daryano et al 2017 water shortage brings about drought stress and imposes growth depressions and yield penalties to almost all crop plants variation exists in the degree and intensity of trouble in plant growth and depression in grain yield depending on plant species plant species native to arid regions or adapted to low water supply are expected to withstand drought associated troubles and depressions considering the urgency of water shortage in arid and semi arid parts of the world encouraging cultivation of medicinal plant species with low water requirement seems inevitable fennel is a herbaceous medicinal plant grown in arid and semi arid regions ashraf and akhtar 2004 fennel s products have been implicated in remediation of a variety of human diseases mainly because of their antioxidative and radical scavenging potential barros et al 2009 since fennel is considered tolerant to various stresses it might be a suitable medicinal crop for achieving high wue at least in drought prone environments we hypothesize that adoption of semi arid based medicinal crops such as fennel foeniculum vulgare mill will improve the sustainability of crop production in the drought prone regions under changing climate our previous studies e g askari and ehsanzadeh 2015 have shown that fennel is potent to be hired as an alternative crop for tackling the water scarcity crisis which isgrowing in the arid and semiarid regions plants often benefit from endogenous organic osmolytes to tackle the osmotic stress through osmotic adjustment and thereby maintaining of adequate water absorption yoshiba et al 1997 dos santos et al 2013 among different osmoticums the amino acid proline is the main substance in a wide range of biota lehmann et al 2010 and plant species hare and cress 1997 and in response to an array of stresses verbruggen and hermans 2008 exogenous proline may be applied to ameliorate the stress effects but its effectiveness may vary with plant species ashraf and foolad 2007 external application of amino acids like proline may improve nitrogen uptake and metabolism cerdán et al 2013 osmoregulation and scavenging of reactive oxygen species ros moustakas et al 2011 and hence partial relief of the plants from the stress however according to some reports verbruggen and hermans 2008 sperdouli and moustakas 2015 it may injure non stressed plants ros s such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 have been implicated in plant response to diverse stresses and enzymes such as cat and pox are thought as the primary antioxidative detoxifiers of stress induced h2o2 in many plant species drought stress alters the equilibrium between ros production and enzymatic defense responses in plant tissue as evidenced by increase in h2o2 concentration with drought prolongation lee et al 2007 even though a set of antioxidant enzymes comprising of cat sod apx pox together to other enzymes of ascorbate glutathione pathway are supposed to give shape to an effective scavenging system of stress induced ros the response of this defensive system has proven to be contradictory depending on plant species and type duration and severity of stress cavalcanti et al 2004 the objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of exogenous application of proline as a water management practice to improve grain yield and wue of fennel under different soil moisture conditions in order to fulfill this goal in addition to grain yield components some important physiological attributes were also examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment set up soil conditions and irrigation regimes this 2 year field experiment was carried out at the lavark research farm of isfahan university of technology located in najaf abad 32 32 n 51 23 e 1630m above mean sea level 14 5 c mean annual temperature and 140mm mean annual precipitation iran in 2015 and 2016 the mean daily

consisted of irrigation after 35 45 and 75 85 depletion of available soil water asw and 11 fennel genotypes were urmia hamadan kerman shiraz birjand yazd avicenna kashan mashhad bushehr and isfahan experiment was a 3 replicate split factorial randomized complete block design with main plots consisting of the two irrigation regimes subplots consisting of the 11 fennel genotypes and two levels of foliar proline application proline application was carried out twice at a 10 days interval at 25 50 flowering when plants had been subjected to irrigation regimes at least for six weeks based on its molar mass a 2 3g l of the l proline solution was applied to the plants in each experimental plot to run off plants of the proline free experimental plots were subjected the same amount of foliar applied distilled water details of the experimental field sowing and irrigation have been described in a previous publication askari and ehsanzadeh 2015 each sub plot consisted of five rows that were 2m long and 0 5m apart spacing between plants in the same row was 0 2m the soil was a fine loam typical haplargid and according to the chemical analysis of the soil and 120kgha 1 of a urea fertilizer i e 46 of n was given to the soil at mid april 2015 and late april 2016 when the plants were approximately 25cm tall in 2015 and 30cm tall in 2016 watering regimes were applied and continued to approximately 75 physiological maturity i e mid september 2015 and late september 2016 total asw i e amount of the soil water in the root zone between field capacity and the permanent wilting point was calculated based on eq 1 1 a s w w f c w w p b d v where w fc is the gravimetric soil water content at field capacity w wp is the gravimetric soil water content at the permanent wilting point bd is the bulk density of the soil gcm 3 and v is the volume of soil layer in the root zone m3 readily available soil water raw i e the fraction of asw that a plant can readily extract from the root zone without suffering drought stress was calculated according to eq 2 allen et al 1998 2 r a w ρ a s w the ρ factor varies for different plants from 0 3 for shallow rooted crops at high rates of plant evapotranspiration etc 8mmday 1 to 0 7 for deep rooted crops at low rates of etc 3mmday 1 allen et al 1998 the factor ρ was used to estimate the required time of irrigation to prevent water stress the value of ρ was considered to be 0 4 for fennel askari and ehsanzadeh 2015 the two levels of irrigation were scheduled based on the maximum allowable depletion mad percentage of asw kramer and boyer 1995 and were applied when 35 45 and 75 85 of the asw were depleted from the root zone respectively a soil moisture release curve was developed and used to determine the depletion of the available

most annual crop species occurs at 30 50cm depths the depth of root was considered to be 50cm the irrigation water was applied with a pipe and the volume was measured with a flow meter a synopsis of volume of irrigation water applied is given in table 2 2 2 measurement of chlorophyll concentration and enzymes activities leaf chl concentration was measured four weeks after the application of proline by the spectrophotometer according to lichtenthaler and buschmann 2001 500mg of fresh leaf tissue was grinded in a mortar and pestle containing 10ml of acetone 80 after reading the absorption of leaf extract solution pigment concentration was measured and calculated according to the details given in askari and ehsanzadeh 2015 enzyme extraction was done four weeks after the application of proline using fresh leaf samples according to yousefzadeh najafabadi and ehsanzadeh 2017 assessment of the antioxidant enzymes activity and protein content was undertaken using the enzyme extract the activity of cat ec 1 11 1 6 was determined by measuring the conversion rate of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 extinction coefficient 39 4mm 1 cm 1 to water and oxygen molecules for 1min further details of the preparation of the mixture are given in yousefzadeh najafabadi and ehsanzadeh 2017 the decrease in absorbance was quantified spectrophotometrically at 240nm cat activity was expressed as unit per milligram of protein chance and maehly 1955 the amount of cat required to decompose 1 0μm of h2o2 per minute was defined as one unit of cat activity ascorbate peroxidase apx ec 1 11 1 11 activity was quantified by measuring the oxidation of ascorbate extinction coefficient 2 8mm 1 cm 1 to dehydroascorbate at 290nm spectrophotometrically as described by nakano and asada 1981 and detailed by yousefzadeh najafabadi and ehsanzadeh 2017 apx activity was expressed as unit per milligram of protein one unit of apx activity was defined as the amount of enzyme necessary for the oxidation of 1μmol of ascorbate per minute peroxidase pox ec 1 11 1 7 activity measurement was based on the method described by herzog and fahimi 1973 which measures the increase in absorbance at 470nm the increase in absorption at 470nm was followed for 2min the specific enzyme activity was expressed in units mg 1 protein one unit of pox activity indicates the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 1 0μm of guaiacol in 1min since measuring enzymes activity necessitates quantifying available protein in the sample total protein content of leaf samples was determined using the method described by bradford 1976 2 3 measurement of growth parameters grain yield components grain yield essential oil yield and water use efficiency days to flowering was determined visually and a plot was defined to be at flowering when more than 50 of the plants had produced flowers plant height and branches plant and umbels per plant were determined using 5 plants from the second row of each plot at physiological maturity at 70 80 physiological maturity the plants from the central 2m2 portion in each plot were harvested and air dried at least for 7days above ground dry mass was determined by drying a subsample at 72 c for 72h grain yield m2 was determined by threshing and separating the grains from the straw and adjusting for a mean grain moisture content of 5 harvest index was calculated as the ratio of grain to above ground dry mass and expressed as percent a 20g sample of seeds of each plot was grind to a powder and hydrodistillation of essential oil at 200ml of deionized water was done according to clevenger 1928 by the clevenger s apparatus borosil india distillation process continued for 4h at 100 c the essential oil phase was separated dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and kept in a dark glass bottle at 4 c essential oil yield was calculated by multiplying essential oil concentration at grain yield and expressed as g m2 irrigation wue was determined by dividing above ground dry mass g m2 to total water applied l m2 in each irrigation level and expressed as g l 2 4 statistical analysis year and block were considered as random and irrigation proline and genotype were considered as fixed effects a combined analysis of variances over the data obtained from the 2 year study was done using the general linear model glm in sas software least significant difference lsd p 0 05 test was employed to separate the means where f test was found statistically significant at p 0 05 pearson correlation coefficients for different traits were calculated for control and drought stress conditions 3 results effects of irrigation regime and genotype on all examined traits were statistically significant but effect of proline application was found to be significant only on days to flowering cat and apx activities chl a and chl b concentrations umbels plant grains m2 1000 grains weight grain yield essential oil yield and wue table 3 mean grains m2 of the drought stressed plants amounted to only 40 of the non stressed plants table 4 mean grains m2 of the non treated plants amounted to 92 of the proline treated plants the greatest means of grains m2 were detected in genotypes yazd kashan shiraz and urmia table 5 since all traits except grains m2 were significantly affected by either proline genotype irrigation proline or irrigation genotype interaction effect hereafter mean comparisons will be confined to the interactions 3 1 genotype irrigation interaction days to flowering branches plant 1000 grains weight and hence grain yield were decreased in all genotypes under drought stress conditions harvest index essential oil yield and wue were depressed in the drought exposed plants of all genotypes but genotypes bushehr and shiraz must be exempted from this generalization as the latter attributes of these genotypes tended to stay unchanged in contrary to cat activity that tended to increase in drought stricken plants of all genotypes though with different extents pox activity of the stressed plants decreased or remained unchanged in all genotypes apx activity of drought stressed plants of hamadan increased those of kashan and kerman remained unchanged and those of the remaining genotypes decreased in comparison to non stressed plants 3 2 proline irrigation interaction drought led to statistically significant increase in cat activity at the absence of exogenous proline but it led to decrease in the activity of this enzyme at the presence of exogenous proline fig 1 a drought resulted in statistically significant decrease in pox activity at the absence of proline but it did not result in such an effect at the presence of proline drought caused statistically significant decreases in days to flowering at the absence and presence of proline but the extent of the decrease was smaller at the presence of external proline fig 1b drought stricken plants indicated statistically significant decreases in chl a and chl b concentrations at the absence and presence of exogenous proline but the extent of the decreases were smaller in the proline treated plants fig 1c and d drought led to statistically significant decreases in branches plant harvest index and essential oil yield both at the presence and absence of proline though decreases in branches plant and essential oil yield were more notable in the proline treated plants 3 3 genotype proline interaction fennel tended to respond to proline treatment in terms of antioxidative enzymes activities in a genotype specific manner table 6 cat activity was decreased or remained unchanged in proline supplied plants with the exception of genotype urmia apx activity remained unchanged in response to proline treatment in a majority of genotypes though it indicated significant increases in genotypes bushehr urmia shiraz and yazd pox activity did not change in the proline treated plants of most genotypes though it increased in mashhad and decreased in hamadan and isfahan growth attributes such as days to flowering branches plant and plant height responded to proline amendment in genotype specific manners days to flowering in a majority of genotypes did not modify when subjected to proline but that of isfahan plants decreased and those of hamadan birjand and mashhad increased branches plant only in avicenna and isfahan plants decreased and those of urmia and yazd plants increased in response to proline application plant height of most of the genotypes did not respond to proline but it increased in response to proline treatment in bushehr kashan and yazd 1000 grains weight of proline treated plants of all genotypes increased with the exception of that of isfahan where it did not change significantly positive response of grain yield to proline in birjand shiraz urmia and yazd was contradicted by a negative response in avicenna and isfahan and lack of response from the remaining genotypes essential oil yield of most genotypes did not modify significantly but those of urmia shiraz and yazd increased when exposed to proline despite lack of notable changes in wue of a majority of genotypes that of isfahan decreased and those of shiraz birjand urmia and yazd increased notably in response to proline application 4 discussion drought induced decreases in plant growth attributes plant height branches plant days to flowering chl a and chl b concentrations and yield components 1000 grains weight umbels plant and grains m2 of fennel set of genotypes examined in the present study were considerable tables 4 and 5 these large depressions were expectedly transferred to notable decreases in grain yield of these fennel genotypes albeit these decreases were less notable in three of the genotypes that had previously been defined as drought tolerant askari and ehsanzadeh 2015 chl is normally subject to an ongoing turnover as estimates of chl half life are in the order of 16 58h eckhardt et al 2004 these photosynthetic pigments are prone to a number of environmental constraints including salinity santos 2004 nutrient deficiencies mirjahanmardi and ehsanzadeh 2016 and water deficit dos santos et al 2013 the multi billions chl molecules present in a plant leaf are bound to proteins of photosynthetic membranes von wettstein et al 1995 both chl biosynthesis and degradation take place in the same cellular compartment i e chloroplasts any of the foregone environmental limitations are potent to cause harm to the plastid integrity photosynthetic membranes and the proteins therein the stress driven decreases of leaf chl concentration may stem from an increase of chl degradation or a decrease of chl synthesis upregulation of chlorophyllase enzyme and hence chl degradation under stress conditions is postulated but it has been cautioned that while mild stress stimulates chlorophyllase activity severe stresses may inhibit the activity of this enzyme santos 2004 although chl degradation is undoubtedly enhanced under stressful conditions but inhibition of synthesis of some chl precursors is responsible for at least a proportion of decrease in chl concentration of stressed plants no photosynthetic measurements were carried out in our experiment but decreases in leaf area stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate are expected to occur in stressed plants puangbut et al 2017 therefore decreases in photosynthetic pigments concomitant to lowering of branches plant height grain yield and dry mass are parts of a general stress response typically observed in different plant species and might have taken place as a result of depression in the photosynthetic activity of the drought stricken fennel plants lack of interaction effects of the experimental factors on two of the grain yield components i e 1000 grains weight and grains m2 table 3 indicates that these two traits modifications in response to any of the experimental factors are not dependent on the other factors in fact our data are suggestive of 20 and 56 drought induced decreases in mean 1000 grains weight and grains m2 respectively data not shown since mean modifications in the remaining yield component i e umbels plant amounted to 59 it may be concluded that 1000 grain weight was the least variable yield component in response to drought these findings and the fact that the grain yield was highly correlated to grains m2 i e correlation coefficients of 0 93 and 0 92 for control and stress conditions respectively table 7 indicate that grain yield is mainly tuned by grains m2 the above supposition conforms to the notion proposed by slafer et al 2014 drought may negatively influence all grain yield components and harvest index but the extent of the depression varies with plant species and genotype the stage and duration of stress and type of component daryano et al 2017 in maize for example pre anthesis drought leads to depression in grain yield due to a substantial decrease in grains m2 and a small decrease in 1000 grains weight moser et al 2006 in safflower the extent of decrease in grain yield varies with the growth stage at which drought is imposed to the plants singh et al 2016 stress associated modifications in grain yield and plant dry mass may lead to alterations either decrease or increase in harvest index for instance imposing stress early in the development of maize may lead to increase in harvest index but prolong drought has led to a decrease in harvest index of jerusalem artichoke ruttanaprasert et al 2016 contrasting to our expectation that the prolonged water deprivation may lead to increase in harvest index our results indicated that harvest index of fennel genotypes invariably decreased at the presence of drought the latter finding suggests that drought has left more detrimental effects on grain attributes rather than on the vegetative attributes of fennel decreases in grain and plant dry mass of stressed plants often result in lower wue for example wue of drought stressed plants of jerusalem artichoke decreased and the decrease in that of drought tolerant genotypes was smaller than the drought sensitive ones ruttanaprasert et al 2016 our data are in line to the latter report as drought led to decrease in wue of the fennel genotypes and decreases in the drought tolerant genotypes tended to be smaller than the more sensitive ones water deprivation caused serious reduction in chl concentration in parallel with the plant general growth and hence grain yield of the examined fennel genotypes the restriction in latter attributes was not associated with a substantial increase in antioxidative enzymes activity table 5 instead pox and apx were downregulated by 20 and 16 respectively and cat activity indicated a 50 increase in the stressed plants averaged over genotypes and proline application levels data not shown furthermore no significant correlative association was noted between antioxidant enzymes activities and grain yield and essential oil yield table 7 antioxidative enzymes activities and behavior in response to stresses seems to be different depending on plant species genotype and stress duration and severity for example antioxidative defense system of hexaploid wheat is reported to be less efficient in comparison to wheats of lower ploidy levels i e tetra and diploid wheats zhang and kirkham 1994 furthermore there are several reports suggesting that the activity of antioxidant enzymes is enhanced at the early steps of exposure to constrain zhang and kirkham 1994 and lower intensities of stress cavalcanti et al 2004 but the level of activity is maintained or decreased with prolongation or intensification of stress lack of effectiveness of cat and pox antioxidant system in withstanding salinity stress has been found in cowpea cavalcanti et al 2004 our results are further confirmed by the report of kronfuss et al 1996 where they found that a moderate but prolong drought led to a decrease in the activity of pox of needles of norway spruce picea abies l karst in stresses that lead to stomatal closure of c3 plants as it must have been the case with the drought stricken fennel plants of the present study rubisco oxygenation i e photorespiration is enhanced leading to a boost in h2o2 generation in the peroxisomes cat activity is known to be crucial in removing the h2o2 the increase in cat activity in the stressed fennel plants might therefore be related to the necessity of counter effecting photorespiratory induced h2o2 during a gradual and prolonged water deprivation activities of pox and apx indicate clear increases over the course of early steps of stress which is suggestive of the activation of ascorbate glutathione pathway lee et al 2007 with prolongation of stress e g 3 4 weeks of water deficit imposition there might be decreases in the activities or modifications in the isozymes of some of these ros scavenging enzymes in fact the effectiveness of antioxidative defense may diminish with a prolonged and or intensified stress where the antioxidative defense system perhaps fails to resist the oxidative damage we did not repeat the enzyme assays with the progress of the prolonged water stress in fennel plants from the data reported by the literature and the decreases in activities of apx and pox in the stressed fennel plants it may be surmised that these decreases are related to the prolongation of drought stress imposed in the present study exogenous proline did not lead to notable modifications in general plant growth with the exception of a 1 5days postponement of flowering in drought stressed plants and small increase and decrease in branches plant of non stressed and stressed plants respectively and reversed moderate modifications in plant height fig 1e g however it improved chl a and chl b concentrations in concomitance to notable decrease in cat activity and increase in pox activity of drought stressed plants fig 1a d in the meantime proline application led to an increased essential oil yield of some fennel genotypes irrespective of water supply condition table 6 an interesting finding of the present study was that even though application of proline resulted in somewhat different responses among the examined genotypes but it led to increases in 1000 grains weight grain yield essential oil yield and wue in a number of the examined genotypes a further interesting and promising finding was that the extent of efficacy of proline on the latter traits was greater in the more drought tolerant genotypes proline supplement may improve plant water relation traits such as osmotic adjustment and leaf relative water content improvement of leaf water status may lead to maintaining of photosynthetic attributes including chl concentration and net photosynthetic rate we did not attempt measuring gas exchange and photosynthetic rate of the fennel but our data of chl concentration are suggestive of proline induced amelioration of stress in the drought stricken plants through increase in chl synthesis or decrease in its degradation ameliorative effects of exogenous proline are thought to be widespread among plant species the effectiveness of exogenous application of osmolytes such as proline may vary with plant species physiological state and concentration stage and number of applications of the osmolyte ashraf and foolad 2007 a lack of responsiveness of certain growth attributes of fennel to exogenous osmolytes as evidenced by plant height and branches plant in present study table 6 has been confirmed in maize s response to exogenous glycine betaine lixin et al 2009 thus the somewhat moderate effectiveness of exogenous proline on chl concentration antioxidant enzymes growth and grain yield of fennel was anticipated nonetheless some reports have cast doubt on the benefits of exogenous proline supply on the account that it may injure non stressed plants verbruggen and hermans 2008 sperdouli and moustakas 2015 in the present study however proline supplement led to positive effects on some traits of fennel plants irrespective of water supply condition tables 4 and 6 which rules out the commonality of harmfulness of external proline at the absence of water deficit reported by sperdouli and moustakas 2015 it must be noted that the extent of proline induced increases in 1000 grains weight grain yield essential oil yield and wue varied with fennel genotype considering the greater dose of proline applied on the fennel plants of the present study i e 20mm relative to a rather low dose of 10mm proline application on a thaliana in the report of sperdouli and moustakas 2015 species specificity and genotype specificity in plant responses to proline supplement are not far from expectation avicenna and isfahan were the only genotypes among the 11 examined genotypes that indicated notable decreases in grain yield in response to exogenous proline table 6 the negative response observed in the latter genotypes raises the possibility of genotype specificity of fennel s response to external proline albeit this proposition needs further investigations as it is evident from the irrigation data given table 2 mean of total irrigation water consumed over the growth period total irrigation water consumed over the growth period in non stress condition total irrigation water consumed over the growth period in stress condition mean irrigation water consumed per irrigation event in non stress condition and mean irrigation water consumed per irrigation event in stress condition were 747 836 659 50 6 and 101 3l m2 respectively it must be noted that since depletion of asw in stress was greater than control condition volume of irrigation water for compensating depletion of asw in each irrigation event in the stress was greater than control condition table 2 considering the fact that proline application led to an increase of 11g m2 in grain yield i e increase from 179 to 190g m2 table 4 our calculations suggest that supplying fennel plants with external proline brings about an approximately 50l m2 saving in the consumed water over the growth period the latter saving in the irrigation water is equivalent to a volume of water required for one irrigation event in the non stress and half an irrigation event in the stress condition exogenous proline appeared to lead to 10 increase in chl concentration 5 15 increases in grain yield components and hence 6 increase in grain yield and 14 increase in essential oil yield of drought tolerant genotypes e g yazd and urmia of this medicinal plant these beneficial effects are equivalent to save an amount of irrigation water equal to one irrigation in the arid climate conditions similar to that the present study was carried out in fact with the exception of genotypes isfahan avicenna kerman and kashan exogenous proline led to increases in wue of the remaining fennel genotypes with yazd indicating the greatest increase in wue table 6 5 conclusions we have been able to gather evidence that the depressions in the grain yield in response to drought were due mainly to decreases in chl concentration umbels plant and grains m2 of fennel genotypes rather than grain weight we also indicated that foliar application of proline amino acid is potent to bring about increases in grain yield essential oil yield and more importantly wue of fennel irrespective of water supply our results provide clear evidence that drought tolerant fennel genotypes such as yazd and urmia are more responsive to exogenous proline altogether our data depict proline as an effective tool for managing the scarce irrigation water in growing fennel medicinal plant in arid conditions acknowledgment the authors are thankful to the isfahan university of technology for fund and facilities given to conduct this research

management practice to improve grain yield and wue of fennel under different soil moisture conditions in order to fulfill this goal in addition to grain yield components some important physiological attributes were also examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment set up soil conditions and irrigation regimes this 2 year field experiment was carried out at the lavark research farm of isfahan

experiment was a 3 replicate split factorial randomized complete block design with main plots consisting of the two irrigation regimes subplots consisting of the 11 fennel genotypes and two levels of foliar proline application proline application was carried out twice at a 10 days interval at 25 50 flowering when plants had been subjected to irrigation regimes at least for six weeks based on its molar mass a 2 3g l of the l proline solution was applied to the plants in each experimental plot to run off plants of the proline free experimental plots were subjected the same amount of foliar applied distilled water details of the experimental field sowing and irrigation have been described in a previous publication askari and ehsanzadeh 2015 each sub plot consisted of five rows that were

i e 46 of n was given to the soil at mid april 2015 and late april 2016 when the plants were approximately 25cm tall in 2015 and 30cm tall in 2016 watering regimes were applied and continued to approximately 75 physiological maturity i e mid september 2015 and late september 2016 total asw i e amount of the soil water in the root zone between field capacity and the permanent wilting point

is the bulk density of the soil gcm 3 and v is the volume of soil layer in the root zone m3 readily available soil water raw i e the fraction of asw that a plant can readily extract from the root zone

most annual crop species occurs at 30 50cm depths the depth of root was considered to be 50cm the irrigation water was applied with a pipe and the volume was measured with a flow meter a synopsis of volume of irrigation water applied is given in table 2 2 2 measurement of chlorophyll concentration and enzymes activities leaf chl concentration was measured four weeks after the application of proline by the spectrophotometer according to lichtenthaler and buschmann 2001 500mg of fresh leaf tissue was grinded in a mortar and pestle containing 10ml of acetone 80 after reading the absorption of leaf extract solution pigment concentration was measured and calculated according to the details given in askari and ehsanzadeh 2015 enzyme extraction was done four weeks after the application of proline using fresh leaf samples according to yousefzadeh najafabadi and ehsanzadeh 2017 assessment of the antioxidant enzymes activity and protein content was undertaken using the enzyme extract the activity of cat ec 1 11 1 6 was determined by measuring the conversion rate of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 extinction coefficient 39 4mm 1 cm 1 to water and oxygen molecules for 1min further details of the preparation of the mixture are given in yousefzadeh najafabadi and ehsanzadeh 2017 the decrease in absorbance was quantified spectrophotometrically at 240nm cat activity was expressed as unit per milligram of protein chance and maehly 1955 the amount of cat required to decompose 1 0μm of h2o2 per minute was defined as one unit of cat activity ascorbate peroxidase apx ec 1 11 1 11 activity was quantified by measuring the oxidation of ascorbate extinction coefficient 2 8mm 1 cm 1 to dehydroascorbate at 290nm spectrophotometrically as described by nakano and asada 1981 and detailed by yousefzadeh najafabadi and ehsanzadeh 2017 apx activity was expressed as unit per milligram of protein one unit of apx activity was defined as the amount of enzyme necessary for the oxidation of 1μmol of ascorbate per minute peroxidase pox ec 1 11 1 7 activity measurement was based on the method described by herzog and fahimi 1973 which measures the increase in absorbance at 470nm the increase in absorption at 470nm was followed for 2min the specific enzyme activity was expressed in units mg 1 protein one unit of pox activity indicates the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 1 0μm of guaiacol in 1min since measuring enzymes activity necessitates quantifying available protein in the sample total protein content of leaf samples was determined using the method described by bradford 1976 2 3 measurement of growth parameters grain yield components grain yield essential oil yield and water use efficiency days to flowering was determined visually and a plot was defined to be at flowering when more than 50 of the plants had produced flowers plant height and branches plant and umbels per plant were determined using 5 plants from the second row of each plot at physiological maturity at 70 80 physiological maturity the plants from the central 2m2 portion in each plot were harvested and air dried at least for 7days above ground dry mass was determined by drying a subsample at 72 c for 72h grain yield m2 was determined by threshing and separating the grains from the straw and adjusting for a mean grain moisture content of 5 harvest index was calculated as the ratio of grain to above ground dry mass and expressed as percent a 20g sample of seeds of each plot was grind to a powder and hydrodistillation of essential oil at 200ml of deionized water was done according to clevenger 1928 by the clevenger s apparatus borosil india distillation process continued for 4h at 100 c the essential oil phase was separated dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and kept in a dark glass bottle at 4 c essential oil yield was calculated by multiplying essential oil concentration at grain yield and expressed as g m2 irrigation wue was determined by dividing above ground dry mass g m2 to total water applied l m2 in each irrigation level and expressed as g l 2 4 statistical analysis year and block were considered as random and irrigation proline and genotype were considered as fixed effects a combined analysis of variances over the data obtained from the 2 year study was done using the general linear model glm in sas software least significant difference lsd p 0 05 test was employed to separate the means where f test was found statistically significant at p 0 05 pearson correlation coefficients for different traits were calculated for control and drought stress conditions 3 results effects of irrigation regime and genotype on all examined traits were statistically significant but effect of proline application was found to be significant only on days to flowering cat and apx activities chl a and chl b concentrations umbels plant grains m2 1000 grains weight grain yield essential oil yield and wue table 3 mean grains m2 of the drought stressed plants amounted to only 40 of the non stressed plants table 4 mean grains m2 of the non treated plants amounted to 92 of the proline treated plants the greatest means of grains m2 were detected in genotypes yazd kashan shiraz and urmia table 5 since all traits except grains m2 were significantly affected by either proline genotype irrigation proline or irrigation genotype interaction effect hereafter mean comparisons will be confined to the interactions 3 1 genotype irrigation interaction days to flowering branches plant 1000 grains weight and hence grain yield were decreased in all genotypes under drought stress conditions harvest index essential oil yield and wue were depressed in the drought exposed plants of all genotypes but genotypes bushehr and shiraz must be exempted from this generalization as the latter attributes of these genotypes tended to stay unchanged in contrary to cat activity that tended to increase in drought stricken plants of all genotypes though with different extents pox activity of the stressed plants decreased or remained unchanged in all genotypes apx activity of drought stressed plants of hamadan increased those of kashan and kerman remained unchanged and those of the remaining genotypes decreased in comparison to non stressed plants 3 2 proline irrigation interaction drought led to statistically significant increase in cat activity at the absence of exogenous proline but it led to decrease in the activity of this enzyme at the presence of exogenous proline fig 1 a drought resulted in statistically significant decrease in pox activity at the absence of proline but it did not result in such an effect at the presence of proline drought caused statistically significant decreases in days to flowering at the absence and presence of proline but the extent of the decrease was smaller at the presence of external proline fig 1b drought stricken plants indicated statistically significant decreases in chl a and chl b concentrations at the absence and presence of exogenous proline but the extent of the decreases were smaller in the proline treated plants fig 1c and d drought led to statistically significant decreases in branches plant harvest index and essential oil yield both at the presence and absence of proline though decreases in branches plant and essential oil yield were more notable in the proline treated plants 3 3 genotype proline interaction fennel tended to respond to proline treatment in terms of antioxidative enzymes activities in a genotype specific manner table 6 cat activity was decreased or remained unchanged in proline supplied plants with the exception of genotype urmia apx activity remained unchanged in response to proline treatment in a majority of genotypes though it indicated significant increases in genotypes bushehr urmia shiraz and yazd pox activity did not change in the proline treated plants of most genotypes though it increased in mashhad and decreased in hamadan and isfahan growth attributes such as days to flowering branches plant and plant height responded to proline amendment in genotype specific manners days to flowering in a majority of genotypes did not modify when subjected to proline but that of isfahan plants decreased and those of hamadan birjand and mashhad increased branches plant only in avicenna and isfahan plants decreased and those of urmia and yazd plants increased in response to proline application plant height of most of the genotypes did not respond to proline but it increased in response to proline treatment in bushehr kashan and yazd 1000 grains weight of proline treated plants of all genotypes increased with the exception of that of isfahan where it did not change significantly positive response of grain yield to proline in birjand shiraz urmia and yazd was contradicted by a negative response in avicenna and isfahan and lack of response from the remaining genotypes essential oil yield of most genotypes did not modify significantly but those of urmia shiraz and yazd increased when exposed to proline despite lack of notable changes in wue of a majority of genotypes that of isfahan decreased and those of shiraz birjand urmia and yazd increased notably in response to proline application 4 discussion drought induced decreases in plant growth attributes plant height branches plant days to flowering chl a and chl b concentrations and yield components 1000 grains weight umbels plant and grains m2 of fennel set of genotypes examined in the present study were considerable tables 4 and 5 these large depressions were expectedly transferred to notable decreases in grain yield of these fennel genotypes albeit these decreases were less notable in three of the genotypes that had previously been defined as drought tolerant askari and ehsanzadeh 2015 chl is normally subject to an ongoing turnover as estimates of chl half life are in the order of 16 58h eckhardt et al 2004 these photosynthetic pigments are prone to a number of environmental constraints including salinity santos 2004 nutrient deficiencies mirjahanmardi and ehsanzadeh 2016 and water deficit dos santos et al 2013 the multi billions chl molecules present in a plant leaf are bound to proteins of photosynthetic membranes von wettstein et al 1995 both chl biosynthesis and degradation take place in the same cellular compartment i e chloroplasts any of the foregone environmental limitations are potent to cause harm to the plastid integrity photosynthetic membranes and the proteins therein the stress driven decreases of leaf chl concentration may stem from an increase of chl degradation or a decrease of chl synthesis upregulation of chlorophyllase enzyme and hence chl degradation under stress conditions is postulated but it has been cautioned that while mild stress stimulates chlorophyllase activity severe stresses may inhibit the activity of this enzyme santos 2004 although chl degradation is undoubtedly enhanced under stressful conditions but inhibition of synthesis of some chl precursors is responsible for at least a proportion of decrease in chl concentration of stressed plants no photosynthetic measurements were carried out in our experiment but decreases in leaf area stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate are expected to occur in stressed plants puangbut et al 2017 therefore decreases in photosynthetic pigments concomitant to lowering of branches plant height grain yield and dry mass are parts of a general stress response typically observed in different plant species and might have taken place as a result of depression in the photosynthetic activity of the drought stricken fennel plants lack of interaction effects of the experimental factors on two of the grain yield components i e 1000 grains weight and grains m2 table 3 indicates that these two traits modifications in response to any of the experimental factors are not dependent on the other factors in fact our data are suggestive of 20 and 56 drought induced decreases in mean 1000 grains weight and grains m2 respectively data not shown since mean modifications in the remaining yield component i e umbels plant amounted to 59 it may be concluded that 1000 grain weight was the least variable yield component in response to drought these findings and the fact that the grain yield was highly correlated to grains m2 i e correlation coefficients of 0 93 and 0 92 for control and stress conditions respectively table 7 indicate that grain yield is mainly tuned by grains m2 the above supposition conforms to the notion proposed by slafer et al 2014 drought may negatively influence all grain yield components and harvest index but the extent of the depression varies with plant species and genotype the stage and duration of stress and type of component daryano et al 2017 in maize for example pre anthesis drought leads to depression in grain yield due to a substantial decrease in grains m2 and a small decrease in 1000 grains weight moser et al 2006 in safflower the extent of decrease in grain yield varies with the growth stage at which drought is imposed to the plants singh et al 2016 stress associated modifications in grain yield and plant dry mass may lead to alterations either decrease or increase in harvest index for instance imposing stress early in the development of maize may lead to increase in harvest index but prolong drought has led to a decrease in harvest index of jerusalem artichoke ruttanaprasert et al 2016 contrasting to our expectation that the prolonged water deprivation may lead to increase in harvest index our results indicated that harvest index of fennel genotypes invariably decreased at the presence of drought the latter finding suggests that drought has left more detrimental effects on grain attributes rather than on the vegetative attributes of fennel decreases in grain and plant dry mass of stressed plants often result in lower wue for example wue of drought stressed plants of jerusalem artichoke decreased and the decrease in that of drought tolerant genotypes was smaller than the drought sensitive ones ruttanaprasert et al 2016 our data are in line to the latter report as drought led to decrease in wue of the fennel genotypes and decreases in the drought tolerant genotypes tended to be smaller than the more sensitive ones water deprivation caused serious reduction in chl concentration in parallel with the plant general growth and hence grain yield of the examined fennel genotypes the restriction in latter attributes was not associated with a substantial increase in antioxidative enzymes activity table 5 instead pox and apx were downregulated by 20 and 16 respectively and cat activity indicated a 50 increase in the stressed plants averaged over genotypes and proline application levels data not shown furthermore no significant correlative association was noted between antioxidant enzymes activities and grain yield and essential oil yield table 7 antioxidative enzymes activities and behavior in response to stresses seems to be different depending on plant species genotype and stress duration and severity for example antioxidative defense system of hexaploid wheat is reported to be less efficient in comparison to wheats of lower ploidy levels i e tetra and diploid wheats zhang and kirkham 1994 furthermore there are several reports suggesting that the activity of antioxidant enzymes is enhanced at the early steps of exposure to constrain zhang and kirkham 1994 and lower intensities of stress cavalcanti et al 2004 but the level of activity is maintained or decreased with prolongation or intensification of stress lack of effectiveness of cat and pox antioxidant system in withstanding salinity stress has been found in cowpea cavalcanti et al 2004 our results are further confirmed by the report of kronfuss et al 1996 where they found that a moderate but prolong drought led to a decrease in the activity of pox of needles of norway spruce picea abies l karst in stresses that lead to stomatal closure of c3 plants as it must have been the case with the drought stricken fennel plants of the present study rubisco oxygenation i e photorespiration is enhanced leading to a boost in h2o2 generation in the peroxisomes cat activity is known to be crucial in removing the h2o2 the increase in cat activity in the stressed fennel plants might therefore be related to the necessity of counter effecting photorespiratory induced h2o2 during a gradual and prolonged water deprivation activities of pox and apx indicate clear increases over the course of early steps of stress which is suggestive of the activation of ascorbate glutathione pathway lee et al 2007 with prolongation of stress e g 3 4 weeks of water deficit imposition there might be decreases in the activities or modifications in the isozymes of some of these ros scavenging enzymes in fact the effectiveness of antioxidative defense may diminish with a prolonged and or intensified stress where the antioxidative defense system perhaps fails to resist the oxidative damage we did not repeat the enzyme assays with the progress of the prolonged water stress in fennel plants from the data reported by the literature and the decreases in activities of apx and pox in the stressed fennel plants it may be surmised that these decreases are related to the prolongation of drought stress imposed in the present study exogenous proline did not lead to notable modifications in general plant growth with the exception of a 1 5days postponement of flowering in drought stressed plants and small increase and decrease in branches plant of non stressed and stressed plants respectively and reversed moderate modifications in plant height fig 1e g however it improved chl a and chl b concentrations in concomitance to notable decrease in cat activity and increase in pox activity of drought stressed plants fig 1a d in the meantime proline application led to an increased essential oil yield of some fennel genotypes irrespective of water supply condition table 6 an interesting finding of the present study was that even though application of proline resulted in somewhat different responses among the examined genotypes but it led to increases in 1000 grains weight grain yield essential oil yield and wue in a number of the examined genotypes a further interesting and promising finding was that the extent of efficacy of proline on the latter traits was greater in the more drought tolerant genotypes proline supplement may improve plant water relation traits such as osmotic adjustment and leaf relative water content improvement of leaf water status may lead to maintaining of photosynthetic attributes including chl concentration and net photosynthetic rate we did not attempt measuring gas exchange and photosynthetic rate of the fennel but our data of chl concentration are suggestive of proline induced amelioration of stress in the drought stricken plants through increase in chl synthesis or decrease in its degradation ameliorative effects of exogenous proline are thought to be widespread among plant species the effectiveness of exogenous application of osmolytes such as proline may vary with plant species physiological state and concentration stage and number of applications of the osmolyte ashraf and foolad 2007 a lack of responsiveness of certain growth attributes of fennel to exogenous osmolytes as evidenced by plant height and branches plant in present study table 6 has been confirmed in maize s response to exogenous glycine betaine lixin et al 2009 thus the somewhat moderate effectiveness of exogenous proline on chl concentration antioxidant enzymes growth and grain yield of fennel was anticipated nonetheless some reports have cast doubt on the benefits of exogenous proline supply on the account that it may injure non stressed plants verbruggen and hermans 2008 sperdouli and moustakas 2015 in the present study however proline supplement led to positive effects on some traits of fennel plants irrespective of water supply condition tables 4 and 6 which rules out the commonality of harmfulness of external proline at the absence of water deficit reported by sperdouli and moustakas 2015 it must be noted that the extent of proline induced increases in 1000 grains weight grain yield essential oil yield and wue varied with fennel genotype considering the greater dose of proline applied on the fennel plants of the present study i e 20mm relative to a rather low dose of 10mm proline application on a thaliana in the report of sperdouli and moustakas 2015 species specificity and genotype specificity in plant responses to proline supplement are not far from expectation avicenna and isfahan were the only genotypes among the 11 examined genotypes that indicated notable decreases in grain yield in response to exogenous proline table 6 the negative response observed in the latter genotypes raises the possibility of genotype specificity of fennel s response to external proline albeit this proposition needs further investigations as it is evident from the irrigation data given table 2 mean of total irrigation water consumed over the growth period total irrigation water consumed over the growth period in non stress condition total irrigation water consumed over the growth period in stress condition mean irrigation water consumed per irrigation event in non stress condition and mean irrigation water consumed per irrigation event in stress condition were 747 836 659 50 6 and 101 3l m2 respectively it must be noted that since depletion of asw in stress was greater than control condition volume of irrigation water for compensating depletion of asw in each irrigation event in the stress was greater than control condition table 2 considering the fact that proline application led to an increase of 11g m2 in grain yield i e increase from 179 to 190g m2 table 4 our calculations suggest that supplying fennel plants with external proline brings about an approximately 50l m2 saving in the consumed water over the growth period the latter saving in the irrigation water is equivalent to a volume of water required for one irrigation event in the non stress and half an irrigation event in the stress condition exogenous proline appeared to lead to 10 increase in chl concentration 5 15 increases in grain yield components and hence 6 increase in grain yield and 14 increase in essential oil yield of drought tolerant genotypes e g yazd and urmia of this medicinal plant these beneficial effects are equivalent to save an amount of irrigation water equal to one irrigation in the arid climate conditions similar to that the present study was carried out in fact with the exception of genotypes isfahan avicenna kerman and kashan exogenous proline led to increases in wue of the remaining fennel genotypes with yazd indicating the greatest increase in wue table 6 5 conclusions we have been able to gather evidence that the depressions in the grain yield in response to drought were due mainly to decreases in chl concentration umbels plant and grains m2 of fennel genotypes rather than grain weight we also indicated that foliar application of proline amino acid is potent to bring about increases in grain yield essential oil yield and more importantly wue of fennel irrespective of water supply our results provide clear evidence that drought tolerant fennel genotypes such as yazd and urmia are more responsive to exogenous proline altogether our data depict proline as an effective tool for managing the scarce irrigation water in growing fennel medicinal plant in arid conditions acknowledgment the authors are thankful to the isfahan university of technology for fund and facilities given to conduct this research

from the soil solution can only account for a small part of the co2 found in tree stems suggesting that much of the trunk xylem co2 originates from root respiration teskey and mcguire 2007 thus conventional methods for measuring belowground respiration underestimate actual rates in this study we measured soil and xylem fluxes of co2 sap flux xylem sap ph and root nonstructural carbohydrate

autotrophic and heterotrophic components of below ground respiration lysimeters with similar soil from a nearby orchard were used to quantify ratios of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration in the

lincoln ne was used for measurement of total below ground respiration using the lysimeter measurements ignoring changes in heterotrophic soil respiration in the presence of plants and the procedure of aubrey and teskey 2009 we calculated total autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration after subtracting the average inorganic carbon content of the water in the respective treatments differences in soil dissolved inorganic carbon were not statistically significant between treatments temperature sensitivity to respiration q10 of root system respiration in summer and early spring were estimated by

irrigation season and during winter when rainwater leached the soil in early spring before irrigation commenced ph values were lowest fig 1 and the correlations to ph were weak and for fw not significant table 1 and sup table s3 comparison of correlation coefficients shows that in winter and summer ph is highly correlated to xylem sap co2 temperature and sap flux were always weakly significantly correlated and in early spring they were more highly correlated than ph table 1 and sup table s3 diel courses of xylem sap co2 sap flux ph xylem transported co2 and soil co2 efflux for august 14 doy 227 summer irrigation period and march 12 doy 72 early spring post rain period are shown in fig 4 the diel course of root respired co2 was similar to that of soil co2 efflux and sap flux but the amplitude depended on xylem sap ph and irrigation water quality fig 4 table 1 3 5 autotrophic and heterotrophic components of below ground co2 flux mean daytime average xylem co2 flux mmolm 2 h 1 was not statistically different from that from the soil in both seasons table 2 thus the quantity of co2 moving internally from roots through the xylem was similar in magnitude to the total amount of co2 diffusing from the soil to the atmosphere from autotrophic and heterotrophic sources combined total belowground co2 efflux soil co2 xylem co2 fluxes was 3 3 and 3 8mmolm 2 h 1 in summer and 0 85 and 1mmolm 2 h 1 in early spring for fw and tww respectively based on soil and water dissolved inorganic carbon dic and ph at 27 c we calculated that 0 31mmolm 2 h 1 and 0 96mmolm 2 h 1 dic entered the tree via water uptake for fw and tww respectively in summer in early spring no differences between treatments were observed after ph and temperature of soil and water were taken into account the amount of carbon coming from the water as dic comprised 7 and 13 of total xylem co2 flux and 3 and 6 of total below ground co2 flux for fw and tww respectively in summer if the dic is subtracted from the summations then in summer the fraction of autotrophic respiration in the xylem was 93 and 87 for fw and tww respectively in early spring 4 5 of xylem co2 flux and 1 5 of total below ground xylem co2 was from dic in both treatments our lysimeter observations showed that 50 57 and 44 50 of soil co2 efflux is derived from autotrophic respiration in summer and winter respectively supplementary table s4 which is very close to the average value used by aubrey and teskey 2009 using these percentages and soil and xylem co2 fluxes table 2 we find that the autotrophic component 71 of total co2 flux in fw and 69 in tww of total belowground co2 flux is more than twice the heterotrophic co2 flux in summer table 2 p 0 001 in winter 71 and 68 of total belowground co2 flux was autotrophic in fw and tww respectively 3 6 quantification of temperature sensitivity of respiration q10 q10 values were estimated based on soil co2 efflux root respired co2 in sap flux total below ground respiration and mid day average temperatures in february 2015 15 c and in spring and summer table 3 bonne et al 1998 q10 values based on february and early spring were not significantly different in the treatments but significant differences p 0 05 were found for those computed for february and summer q10 values calculated using soil co2 efflux were significantly lower p 0 05 than those obtained using co2 in xylem sap or total below ground respiration 3 7 analysis of fine root samples fine root respiration was 35 higher p 0 01 for tww in summer but not winter fig 5 total soluble sugar starch and non structural carbohydrate concentration of fine roots were significantly different for treatments p 0 001 fig 6 in summer but not in early spring in summer total soluble sugar p 0 035 and starch p 0 01 were lower for tww by 30 and 38 respectively fig 6a c in early spring there was no significant difference between fw and tww in summer fine root respiration rates and total soluble sugar increased significantly p 0 01 while starch concentration did not differ significantly between seasons for fw but increased significantly p 0 05 for tww in winter 4 discussion to the best of our knowledge this study is the first report of the influence of irrigation water quality on xylem co2 sap ph and total respiration significant effects of irrigation water quality as well as temperature and growth stage on xylem co2 sap ph and root system respiration were found we quantified the autotrophic component of belowground respiration that contributes to root respired co2 transported in the sap flux tww increased both soil and root respired co2 in the dry summer winter rain leaching of the soil removed the differences until the following spring and the resumption of tww irrigation and high temperatures increased respiration and the differences between treatments returned in general tww had higher saline cation concentrations na cl and b ph sar and organic and inorganic contaminants than fw sup table s1 similarly chemical analysis of the upper soil layer 0 75cm found higher na cl sar and ph and other differences between treatments sup table s1 similar results were found in roots and leaves paudel et al 2016a b after two years we found a relative decrease of nearly 40 in total fine roots sup table s2 and salinity that accumulated from the tww could be the cause rewald et al 2012 rewald et al 2013 over the 9 month study period xylem co2 varied from 0 5 to 8 and xylem sap ph from 5 to 7 5 fig 1a d which is consistent with previous reports for other tree species teskey et al 2008 erda et al 2014 bloemen et al 2015 daytime mean soil co2 efflux ranged from 0 15 to 0 9μmolm 2 s 1 xylem co2 and ph exhibited a strong seasonal response fig 1 and fig 4 similar to previous studies eklund and klintborg 2000 etzold et al 2013 erda et al 2014 our long data set shows the strong relationships between xylem co2 and its potential drivers table 1 fig 1 and 2 in particular temperature was a strong driving factor for co2 in all conditions similar to previous observations in several species eklund and klintborg 2000 etzold et al 2013 erda et al 2014 the dependence of respiratory processes on temperature described by the van t hoff arrhenius equation explains the close coupling between t stem and stem co2 teskey et al 2008 the tight relationship between co2 and ph suggests that ph is a second driver of both seasonal and diel variations of co2 in summer and winter but surprisingly in early spring stem co2 was more strongly correlated to sap flux than ph and high stem co2 in summer coincided with rapid root growth data not shown thus the large seasonal variability in xylem co2 can be explained by temperature growth rate and sap flux etzold et al 2013 xylem sap ph was high in summer decreased until february and increased in the beginning of march figs 1 and 4 thus seasonal variations in xylem sap ph are correlated with temperature as reported for acer platanoides l ford et al 2007 walnut alves et al 2004 and other species aubrey et al 2011 erda et al 2014 tww irrigation increased xylem sap ph by 0 35 0 42 as found for saline irrigation munns 2002 felle et al 2005 but differences were not significant after winter rainfall leached soils diel courses of root respired co2 were similar to those of soil co2 efflux and sap flux but the differences in amplitude of the treatments depended on xylem sap ph fig 4 sup table s3 munns 2002 and felle et al 2005 suggested that cambial reactivation and budburst trigger different physiological processes such as nutrient rennenberg and brunold 1994 and sugar sauter 1988 mobilization as well as the enzymatic activation of plasma membrane h atpase of vessel associated cells alves et al 2004 fromard et al 1995 processes that might cause the observed acidification in winter and early spring in summer progressive alkalization increased ph as compared to early spring fromard et al 1995 salomón et al 2016 this process could be triggered by an element in irrigation water like salinity munns 2002 felle et al 2005 and we found that tww irrigation further increased ph during the summer we found no previous reports on the influence of tww or salinity on co2 in xylem sap in orchards here xylem co2 was measured in the irrigation season and after rainfall leached salts from the soil fig 1a and b xylem co2 was lower for tww in the rainless summer and differences between tww and fw were not significant in the winter rainy season after mid january doy 14 and until early spring doy 75 on the other hand total dissolved co2 computed according to temperature and ph was the same for the irrigation treatments fig 2a and b providing strong evidence that xylem ph water quality changed co2 teskey et al 2008 etzold et al 2013 erda et al 2014 tww irrigation reduced sap flux by 30 35 in summer and 15 20 in winter and early spring fig 2 the reduction of sap flux in winter after soil leaching can be attributed to reduced root surface area for water uptake fig 2c and d and the larger reduction in summer probably reflects on additional osmotic and toxic stress rewald et al 2012 paudel et al 2016a b the increase in soil co2 efflux caused by tww irrigation has been reported previously meli et al 2002 ramirez fuentes et al 2002 elifantz et al 2011 heinze et al 2014 rodríguez liébana et al 2014 and similar increases have been reported for heavy metal contaminated soils chander and brookes 1991 fliessbach et al 1994 and saline soils sarig and steinberger 1994 friedel et al 2000 one reason for the increase could be increased activity of microorganisms due to additional organic matter and nutrients in addition increased salinity leads to soil sodification dispersion hydrophobicity and mineralization which could also increase soil co2 efflux heinze et al 2014 friedel et al 2000 that the differences in soil co2 efflux were limited to the summer irrigation season could be due to leaching of contaminants by winter rainfall followed by soil root system recovery elifantz et al 2011 gonzález méndez et al 2015 trunk xylem co2 flux was higher in summer than in winter and early spring fig 3c and d for tww in summer it was slightly higher than for fw however as less root surface area was found for tww irrigation trunk xylem co2 flux in summer per root area was 25 30 higher in tww than fw fig s2 thus similar to soil respiration in winter roots recovered from the influence of tww due to winter rain leaching of salts from the soil because root respired co2 diffuses into the soil atmosphere and dissolves in the transpiration stream the two fluxes must be investigated simultaneously to fully understand root metabolic dynamics aubrey and teskey 2009 bloemen et al 2015 the magnitude of the below ground respiration in commercial orchards may considerably exceed that of heterotopic respiration when the amount of co2 transported via the transpiration stream is considered in addition to the autotrophic contribution to soil co2 efflux in our study tww increased root respired co2 in xylem sap by 8 15 in summer which was less than the changes in soil co2 efflux in summer 36 and early spring 12 figs 1 4 table 2 and sup table s3 in the lysimeter experiment the fraction of autotrophic respiration was 53 58 in summer 43 47 in winter and 47 51 in early spring with a seasonal fluctuation of about 10 supplementary table s4 in soil co2 flux heterotrophic respiration was determined from measurements in tree less lysimeters with similar soil and irrigation which should be reliable however the presence of plants can influence heterotrophic respiration so the above fractions require more study aubrey and teskey 2009 assumed that the fraction was 50 which is very close to our results thus the results indicate that total belowground autotrophic respiration was nearly three times larger than heterotropic respiration when root respired co2 in the transpiration stream is considered aubrey and teskey 2009 with only small seasonal changes simulation of the response of below ground carbon flux to temperature e g global warming is usually with a single q10 coefficient q10 may vary with temperature in part because the autotropic and heterotrophic components of soil co2 efflux have different temperature sensitivities hanson et al 2000 our q10 value for the autotropic component 2 4 in early spring and 4 7 in summer is significantly higher than that measured based on bulk soil co2 efflux 2 0 in early spring and 3 8 in summer similar values were found by bonne et al 1998 for tropical forest although previous measurements of root q10 have been for autotrophic root respiration alone determined by assays of roots often excised that were free of in situ rhizosphere soil there have been conflicting reports on respiratory response to tww and salinity for salt tolerant plants 33 of studies reported increases in total respiration and42 decreases while for sensitive plants 58 reported increases and 17 decreases jacoby et al 2011 respiration rates are associated with increased atp production which provides energy for growth of new tissues growth respiration and maintenance and defense processes such as osmotic adjustment sodium exclusion or tissue tolerance maintenance respiration the higher respiration rates for tww may result from increased maintenance respiration which expends valuable carbohydrates that might otherwise be used for growth jacoby et al 2011 johansson 1933 shone and gale 1983 our results of decreased root growth and non structural carbohydrate concentration for tww support the above mechanism for the summer irrigation season fig 6 increased use of tss and starch in roots in response to saline irrigation has been observed in other studies arbona et al 2005 an additional topic that should be addressed is the carbon budget of the orchard obviously ignoring the co2 coming through the sap may lead to large underestimations of total tree respiration since only a small amount of that respiratory co2 is recycled bloemen et al 2014 in our orchard tww decreased total assimilate accumulation paudel et al 2016a b and increased total respiration so less carbon was stored and growth and yield were reduced based on above and below ground measurements at mid day respiration was equivalent to 37 and 59 of the total assimilation for fw and tww respectively see supplementary table s5 if we ignore co2 in the transpiration stream those values are 26 and 41 therefore root respired co2 in the transpiration stream is an important part of the tree carbon balance in conclusion xylem co2 concentration sap ph sap flux and soil co2 flux were significantly changed by tww irrigation and recovered after rainfall leached soils leading to significant seasonal and diel fluctuations significant amounts of co2 are transported within the tree depending on both environment temperature and irrigation water quality and physiology of plants sap flux we found that the q10 was up to 4 6 based autotrophic root respiration and up to 3 8 based on respiration by the bulk soil and was dependent on irrigation water quality and season these measurements are crucial for accurate estimation of belowground respiratory components as influenced by stress understanding belowground respiration dynamics

giraldi 2011 and concerns over health risks of other contaminants bañón et al 2011 gibberd et al 2003 maurer et al 1995 rivero et al 2009 which can decrease physiological efficiency of root systems garcía legaz et al 1993 and lead to soil pollution recently decreasing yields of citrus orchards on clay soils in israel following long term irrigation with tww has been a cause for concern azenkot et al 2014 bardhan et al 2016 and russo et al 2015 have shown that in these cases significant soil salinization takes place in the root zone upon exposure to tww roots of many plants adjust osmotically by producing large quantities of organic osmolytes which is metabolically expensive argamasilla et al 2014 demiral and türkan 2005 high energetic costs are also associated with ion accumulation and blockage of cell walls and root pores by contaminants toxic effects and increased maintenance respiration for active ion transport jacoby et al 2011 decreased respiratory efficiency which has been observed means that growth rates are reduced even though metabolic activity is high asli and neumann 2010 jia et al 2013 rewald et al 2013 schwartz and gale 1981 respiratory co2 which is dissolved in and moves with xylem sap is often overlooked it originates from respiratory processes related to maintenance and growth near the path of sap flux internal co2 concentrations at the base of the trunk are orders of magnitude larger than the atmosphere teskey et al 2008 indicating that much trunk base co2 originates belowground teskey and mcguire 2007 dissolved inorganic carbon absorbed by roots from the soil solution can only account for a small part of the co2 found in tree stems suggesting that much of the trunk xylem co2 originates from root respiration teskey and mcguire 2007 thus conventional methods for measuring belowground respiration underestimate actual rates in this study we measured soil and xylem fluxes of co2 sap flux xylem sap ph and root nonstructural carbohydrate content in grapefruit trees along with climate parameters analysis allowed quantification of whole root system respiration and its autotrophic and heterotrophic components we hypothesized that 1 accurate estimates of the autotrophic components of belowground respiration and respiratory coefficients q10 require consideration of xylem transported co2 and 2 root respiration and q10 increase in response to tww irrigation to the best of our knowledge this is the first quantification of the influence of water quality i e treated waste water on xylem transported co2 in trees and its influence

represented a transition from tww to fw irrigation which commenced in the spring of 2013 while the tww treatment continued the normal orchard irrigation regime a more complete description of the overall experiment which included several treatments and blocks is given elsewhere paudel et al 2016a b here we describe only the part of the experiment relevant to the root respiration study 2 2 irrigation treatments the current experiment was in two blocks of the experiment in each block three of the central trees of two treatment plots were measured one irrigated with fresh water fw i e tap

licor 6400 xt lincoln ne and soil co2 flux chamber li 6400 09 the target value was set close to the ambient co2 concentration 380μmolmol 1 and the δco2 value was set as the factory default value 10μmolmol 1 thin walled pvc collars were inserted in the soil one week before measurement collars were 10cm in diameter and 10cm high measurements were made at 5cm depth in four directions around the trees with 6 8 replications soil temperature was determined along with soil co2 efflux using a digital thermometer measurements were validated by comparing to a series of air samples collected in a static chamber heller et al 2010 and analyzed for co2 by a gc ms gas chromatograph mass spectrometer system 8610c sri instruments torrance ca in order to separate autotrophic and heterotrophic

autotrophic and heterotrophic components of below ground respiration lysimeters with similar soil from a nearby orchard were used to quantify ratios of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration in the

lincoln ne was used for measurement of total below ground respiration using the lysimeter measurements ignoring changes in heterotrophic soil respiration in the presence of plants and the procedure of aubrey and teskey 2009 we calculated total autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration after subtracting the average inorganic carbon content of the water in the respective treatments differences in soil dissolved inorganic carbon were not statistically significant between treatments temperature sensitivity to respiration q10 of root system respiration in summer and early spring were estimated by comparing to winter time rates after zwieniecki et al 2015 as q 10 r t 1 r t 2 10 t 1 t 2 where q10 describes the change in respiration rate over 10 c and rt1 and rt2 are respiration rates at

irrigation season and during winter when rainwater leached the soil in early spring before irrigation commenced ph values were lowest fig 1 and the correlations to ph were weak and for fw not significant table 1 and sup table s3 comparison of correlation coefficients shows that in winter and summer ph is highly correlated to xylem sap co2 temperature and sap flux were always weakly significantly correlated and in early spring they were more highly correlated than ph table 1 and sup table s3 diel courses of xylem sap co2 sap flux ph xylem transported co2 and soil co2 efflux for august 14 doy 227 summer irrigation period and march 12 doy 72 early spring post rain period are shown in fig 4 the diel course of root respired co2 was similar to that of soil co2 efflux and sap flux but the amplitude depended on xylem sap ph and irrigation water quality fig 4 table 1 3 5 autotrophic and heterotrophic components of below ground co2 flux mean daytime average xylem co2 flux mmolm 2 h 1 was not statistically different from that from the soil in both seasons table 2 thus the quantity of co2 moving internally from roots through the xylem was similar in magnitude to the total amount of co2 diffusing from the soil to the atmosphere from autotrophic and heterotrophic sources combined total belowground co2 efflux soil co2 xylem co2 fluxes was 3 3 and 3 8mmolm 2 h 1 in summer and 0 85 and 1mmolm 2 h 1 in early spring for fw and tww respectively based on soil and water dissolved inorganic carbon dic and ph at 27 c we calculated that 0 31mmolm 2 h 1 and 0 96mmolm 2 h 1 dic entered the tree via water uptake for fw and tww respectively in summer in early spring no differences between treatments were observed after ph and temperature of soil and water were taken into account the amount of carbon coming from the water as dic comprised 7 and 13 of total xylem co2 flux and 3 and 6 of total below ground co2 flux for fw and tww respectively in summer if the dic is subtracted from the summations then in summer the fraction of autotrophic respiration in the xylem was 93 and 87 for fw and tww respectively in early spring 4 5 of xylem co2 flux and 1 5 of total below ground xylem co2 was from dic in both treatments our lysimeter observations showed that 50 57 and 44 50 of soil co2 efflux is derived from autotrophic respiration in summer and winter respectively supplementary table s4 which is very close to the average value used by aubrey and teskey 2009 using these percentages and soil and xylem co2 fluxes table 2 we find that the autotrophic component 71 of total co2 flux in fw and 69 in tww of total belowground co2 flux is more than twice the heterotrophic co2 flux in summer table 2 p 0 001 in winter 71 and 68 of total belowground co2 flux was autotrophic in fw and tww respectively 3 6 quantification of temperature sensitivity of respiration q10 q10 values were estimated based on soil co2 efflux root respired co2 in sap flux total below ground respiration and mid day average temperatures in february 2015 15 c and in spring and summer table 3 bonne et al 1998 q10 values based on february and early spring were not significantly different in the treatments but significant differences p 0 05 were found for those computed for february and summer q10 values calculated using soil co2 efflux were significantly lower p 0 05 than those obtained using co2 in xylem sap or total below ground respiration 3 7 analysis of fine root samples fine root respiration was 35 higher p 0 01 for tww in summer but not winter fig 5 total soluble sugar starch and non structural carbohydrate concentration of fine roots were significantly different for treatments p 0 001 fig 6 in summer but not in early spring in summer total soluble sugar p 0 035 and starch p 0 01 were lower for tww by 30 and 38 respectively fig 6a c in early spring there was no significant difference between fw and tww in summer fine root respiration rates and total soluble sugar increased significantly p 0 01 while starch concentration did not differ significantly between seasons for fw but increased significantly p 0 05 for tww in winter 4 discussion to the best of our knowledge this study is the first report of the influence of irrigation water quality on xylem co2 sap ph and total respiration significant effects of irrigation water quality as well as temperature and growth stage on xylem co2 sap ph and root system respiration were found we quantified the autotrophic component of belowground respiration that contributes to root respired co2 transported in the sap flux tww increased both soil and root respired co2 in the dry summer winter rain leaching of the soil removed the differences until the following spring and the resumption of tww irrigation and high temperatures increased respiration and the differences between treatments returned in general tww had higher saline cation concentrations na cl and b ph sar and organic and inorganic contaminants than fw sup table s1 similarly chemical analysis of the upper soil layer 0 75cm found higher na cl sar and ph and other differences between treatments sup table s1 similar results were found in roots and leaves paudel et al 2016a b after two years we found a relative decrease of nearly 40 in total fine roots sup table s2 and salinity that accumulated from the tww could be the cause rewald et al 2012 rewald et al 2013 over the 9 month study period xylem co2 varied from 0 5 to 8 and xylem sap ph from 5 to 7 5 fig 1a d which is consistent with previous reports for other tree species teskey et al 2008 erda et al 2014 bloemen et al 2015 daytime mean soil co2 efflux ranged from 0 15 to 0 9μmolm 2 s 1 xylem co2 and ph exhibited a strong seasonal response fig 1 and fig 4 similar to previous studies eklund and klintborg 2000 etzold et al 2013 erda et al 2014 our long data set shows the strong relationships between xylem co2 and its potential drivers table 1 fig 1 and 2 in particular temperature was a strong driving factor for co2 in all conditions similar to previous observations in several species eklund and klintborg 2000 etzold et al 2013 erda et al 2014 the dependence of respiratory processes on temperature described by the van t hoff arrhenius equation explains the close coupling between t stem and stem co2 teskey et al 2008 the tight relationship between co2 and ph suggests that ph is a second driver of both seasonal and diel variations of co2 in summer and winter but surprisingly in early spring stem co2 was more strongly correlated to sap flux than ph and high stem co2 in summer coincided with rapid root growth data not shown thus the large seasonal variability in xylem co2 can be explained by temperature growth rate and sap flux etzold et al 2013 xylem sap ph was high in summer decreased until february and increased in the beginning of march figs 1 and 4 thus seasonal variations in xylem sap ph are correlated with temperature as reported for acer platanoides l ford et al 2007 walnut alves et al 2004 and other species aubrey et al 2011 erda et al 2014 tww irrigation increased xylem sap ph by 0 35 0 42 as found for saline irrigation munns 2002 felle et al 2005 but differences were not significant after winter rainfall leached soils diel courses of root respired co2 were similar to those of soil co2 efflux and sap flux but the differences in amplitude of the treatments depended on xylem sap ph fig 4 sup table s3 munns 2002 and felle et al 2005 suggested that cambial reactivation and budburst trigger different physiological processes such as nutrient rennenberg and brunold 1994 and sugar sauter 1988 mobilization as well as the enzymatic activation of plasma membrane h atpase of vessel associated cells alves et al 2004 fromard et al 1995 processes that might cause the observed acidification in winter and early spring in summer progressive alkalization increased ph as compared to early spring fromard et al 1995 salomón et al 2016 this process could be triggered by an element in irrigation water like salinity munns 2002 felle et al 2005 and we found that tww irrigation further increased ph during the summer we found no previous reports on the influence of tww or salinity on co2 in xylem sap in orchards here xylem co2 was measured in the irrigation season and after rainfall leached salts from the soil fig 1a and b xylem co2 was lower for tww in the rainless summer and differences between tww and fw were not significant in the winter rainy season after mid january doy 14 and until early spring doy 75 on the other hand total dissolved co2 computed according to temperature and ph was the same for the irrigation treatments fig 2a and b providing strong evidence that xylem ph water quality changed co2 teskey et al 2008 etzold et al 2013 erda et al 2014 tww irrigation reduced sap flux by 30 35 in summer and 15 20 in winter and early spring fig 2 the reduction of sap flux in winter after soil leaching can be attributed to reduced root surface area for water uptake fig 2c and d and the larger reduction in summer probably reflects on additional osmotic and toxic stress rewald et al 2012 paudel et al 2016a b the increase in soil co2 efflux caused by tww irrigation has been reported previously meli et al 2002 ramirez fuentes et al 2002 elifantz et al 2011 heinze et al 2014 rodríguez liébana et al 2014 and similar increases have been reported for heavy metal contaminated soils chander and brookes 1991 fliessbach et al 1994 and saline soils sarig and steinberger 1994 friedel et al 2000 one reason for the increase could be increased activity of microorganisms due to additional organic matter and nutrients in addition increased salinity leads to soil sodification dispersion hydrophobicity and mineralization which could also increase soil co2 efflux heinze et al 2014 friedel et al 2000 that the differences in soil co2 efflux were limited to the summer irrigation season could be due to leaching of contaminants by winter rainfall followed by soil root system recovery elifantz et al 2011 gonzález méndez et al 2015 trunk xylem co2 flux was higher in summer than in winter and early spring fig 3c and d for tww in summer it was slightly higher than for fw however as less root surface area was found for tww irrigation trunk xylem co2 flux in summer per root area was 25 30 higher in tww than fw fig s2 thus similar to soil respiration in winter roots recovered from the influence of tww due to winter rain leaching of salts from the soil because root respired co2 diffuses into the soil atmosphere and dissolves in the transpiration stream the two fluxes must be investigated simultaneously to fully understand root metabolic dynamics aubrey and teskey 2009 bloemen et al 2015 the magnitude of the below ground respiration in commercial orchards may considerably exceed that of heterotopic respiration when the amount of co2 transported via the transpiration stream is considered in addition to the autotrophic contribution to soil co2 efflux in our study tww increased root respired co2 in xylem sap by 8 15 in summer which was less than the changes in soil co2 efflux in summer 36 and early spring 12 figs 1 4 table 2 and sup table s3 in the lysimeter experiment the fraction of autotrophic respiration was 53 58 in summer 43 47 in winter and 47 51 in early spring with a seasonal fluctuation of about 10 supplementary table s4 in soil co2 flux heterotrophic respiration was determined from measurements in tree less lysimeters with similar soil and irrigation which should be reliable however the presence of plants can influence heterotrophic respiration so the above fractions require more study aubrey and teskey 2009 assumed that the fraction was 50 which is very close to our results thus the results indicate that total belowground autotrophic respiration was nearly three times larger than heterotropic respiration when root respired co2 in the transpiration stream is considered aubrey and teskey 2009 with only small seasonal changes simulation of the response of below ground carbon flux to temperature e g global warming is usually with a single q10 coefficient q10 may vary with temperature in part because the autotropic and heterotrophic components of soil co2 efflux have different temperature sensitivities hanson et al 2000 our q10 value for the autotropic component 2 4 in early spring and 4 7 in summer is significantly higher than that measured based on bulk soil co2 efflux 2 0 in early spring and 3 8 in summer similar values were found by bonne et al 1998 for tropical forest although previous measurements of root q10 have been for autotrophic root respiration alone determined by assays of roots often excised that were free of in situ rhizosphere soil there have been conflicting reports on respiratory response to tww and salinity for salt tolerant plants 33 of studies reported increases in total respiration and42 decreases while for sensitive plants 58 reported increases and 17 decreases jacoby et al 2011 respiration rates are associated with increased atp production which provides energy for growth of new tissues growth respiration and maintenance and defense processes such as osmotic adjustment sodium exclusion or tissue tolerance maintenance respiration the higher respiration rates for tww may result from increased maintenance respiration which expends valuable carbohydrates that might otherwise be used for growth jacoby et al 2011 johansson 1933 shone and gale 1983 our results of decreased root growth and non structural carbohydrate concentration for tww support the above mechanism for the summer irrigation season fig 6 increased use of tss and starch in roots in response to saline irrigation has been observed in other studies arbona et al 2005 an additional topic that should be addressed is the carbon budget of the orchard obviously ignoring the co2 coming through the sap may lead to large underestimations of total tree respiration since only a small amount of that respiratory co2 is recycled bloemen et al 2014 in our orchard tww decreased total assimilate accumulation paudel et al 2016a b and increased total respiration so less carbon was stored and growth and yield were reduced based on above and below ground measurements at mid day respiration was equivalent to 37 and 59 of the total assimilation for fw and tww respectively see supplementary table s5 if we ignore co2 in the transpiration stream those values are 26 and 41 therefore root respired co2 in the transpiration stream is an important part of the tree carbon balance in conclusion xylem co2 concentration sap ph sap flux and soil co2 flux were significantly changed by tww irrigation and recovered after rainfall leached soils leading to significant seasonal and diel fluctuations significant amounts of co2 are transported within the tree depending on both environment temperature and irrigation water quality and physiology of plants sap flux we found that the q10 was up to 4 6 based autotrophic root respiration and up to 3 8 based on respiration by the bulk soil and was dependent on irrigation water quality and season these measurements are crucial for accurate estimation of belowground respiratory components as influenced by stress understanding belowground respiration dynamics

11592,the upper kharun catchment ukc which is part of the new state chhattisgarh formed in 2000 features considerable population growth expansion of urban areas and dynamic changes in irrigation infrastructure as well as irrigation practices spatial extension temporal intensification increasing use of groundwater as source for meeting the increasing food demand water intensive rice is the major crop of the area ukc has a comprehensive canal irrigation system which provides the link to water supply from reservoirs fed from areas outside the ukc however water provision for irrigation via the canal system for irrigation is restricted to only post monsoon season as a consequence groundwater remains the only source of irrigation water in summer and winter seasons improved electricity facilities and subsidy on groundwater pumping have triggered an enormous increase in groundwater withdrawals remote sensing satellite images along with ground observed data were used in this study to spatially identify the areas with canal and groundwater irrigation results reveal that in 2011 around 50 of the area of the ukc benefits from canal irrigation whereas 29 8 area is irrigated by groundwater around 103 villages in the ukc have no canal infrastructures 216 villages in ukc are considered as hotspot areas because of high groundwater withdrawal irrigated area exceeding 75 ha per village there has been threefold increase in groundwater irrigated area in ukc between 1991 and 2011 the upward trend of groundwater use indicates an alarming situation towards over exploitation and creates the need to provide and analyze data on the use of groundwater resources in the area in order to detect past and to estimate future trends referring to groundwater withdrawals these data are a prerequisite for enabling careful and foresightful management of groundwater resources especially at spatially identified hotspot areas towards ensuring sustainable management of this resource keywords canal irrigation groundwater irrigation irrigation dynamics hotspot areas over exploitation and spatial analysis 1 introduction agriculture is by far the biggest consumer of water in india more than 85 of india s freshwater is withdrawn by agriculture alone and according to the ministry of water resources it is expected that the irrigation needs will increase by 56 by the year 2050 while the demand for drinking water will double and the water demand for energy production will increase 16 fold asian development bank 2003 irrigation systems in india rely on canal and groundwater according to agricultural census 2010 11 india s total area under irrigation is 64 7 million hectares tube well irrigation contributes to 45 of total share followed by canal irrigation 26 despite of heavy investment in canal infrastructure creation the indian government has not been able to reduce the groundwater depletion the area irrigated with groundwater and its share of total irrigated area shows an increasing trend over time chatterjee 2012 szakonyi and urpelainen 2013 three major reasons drive this trend i rather low canal irrigation efficiency inadequate and unreliable supply hinder actually full or appropriate utilization of the canal irrigation potential ii subsidies in electricity and development in groundwater pumping devices ease groundwater use as an option to overcome the gap according i between actual and potential usage of irrigated lands iii groundwater based irrigation is seen as an option for agricultural production during periods when canal systems are not operated india has emerged as the biggest consumer of groundwater in the world with estimated annual withdrawals of 230km3 cgwb 2014 groundwater irrigation in india covers more than 50 of total irrigated area responsible for 70 of agricultural production and providing livelihood for 50 of the indian population world bank 1998 shah 2010 this extremely high groundwater withdrawal rate is depleting aquifers across the country and declining water table at faster rates than ever before in fact the rates of depletion in india are probably the highest in the world aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 this trend towards unsustainable water management is especially alarming in a country where livelihoods mainly depend on irrigated agriculture and groundwater resources are needed to meet the increasing demand for drinking water rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 livingston 2009 shah 2009 fishman 2011 devineni et al 2013 and russo et al 2013 given this situation there is an urgent need to immediately take appropriate measures to strengthen sustainable management of groundwater via either reducing withdrawals or enhancing recharge rates otherwise several regions in india will face a drastic reduction in agricultural production loss of employment and socio economic stresses there is huge uncertainty in the actual area irrigated the location of irrigated areas and the irrigation strategies water sources timing and intensity of use which leads to uncertainties in estimates of actual water use by irrigation and in turn contributes to mis management of water resources in india the irrigated areas are reported based on census data collected at village level later aggregated to block district state and national level reddy et al 2006 such a process is highly labor extensive and time consuming and the quality of the compiled data is not always reliable biggs et al 2006 droogers 2002 however advancement in satellite remote sensing offers a tremendous potential for continuous monitoring and mapping of irrigated areas due to the availability of satellite imageries at different spatio temporal scales lenney et al 1996 de fries et al 1998 lobell et al 2003 thenkabail et al 2005 2009 ozdogan and gutman 2008 alexandridis et al 2008 the mapping of spatio temporal dynamics of irrigated areas is a key to understand the drivers of change and spatially identify and locate the hotspot regions at high risk of over exploitation due to extensive and unsustainable groundwater irrigation the mapping of canal infrastructure explores the areas where the potential benefits of canal system are still not reached and also reveals the gaps or bottlenecks in the irrigation systems chhattisgarh state is known as the rice bowl of india traditionally rice is grown as a single main monsoon crop yet there is an increasing tendency towards taking rice up as a winter and or summer crop at sites where sufficient groundwater is available to meet the water demand rice is grown in basins which are permanently or at least for a high share of the vegetation period flooded with a water layer as a consequence the gap between rainfall and crop water requirements plus losses by percolation and seepage has to be matched by irrigation water input therefore rice cultivation is requiring a high amount of water which is supplied either by canals from reservoirs or withdrawn from groundwater sources the upper kharun catchment ukc is a part of chhattisgarh state featuring high population growth considerable expansion of urban areas ongoing industrialization and dynamic changes in irrigation practices extension intensification and increasing use of groundwater for meeting the rising food demand ukc has a comprehensive canal irrigation system which provides the link to water supply from reservoirs fed from runoff generated outside upstream the ukc and enables conveyance and distribution of irrigation water within the ukc however water provision for irrigation via the canal system for irrigation is restricted to only post monsoon season september to november during the summer and winter seasons the irrigation water demand of crops can be met by groundwater resources only according to the cgwb report 2012 the expansion of groundwater irrigated areas in chhattisgarh increased 6 fold from 2001 to 2010 and as a result groundwater resources are at the risk of being over exploited for irrigation purposes at least in parts of the chhattisgarh the local people stick to their traditional practice of paddy cultivation which is highly water demanding moreover the government of chhattisgarh is providing subsidies for electricity to pump groundwater for paddy cultivation the practice of over exploitation of precious groundwater resources may lead to a major water crisis in the near future and therefore careful management is essential and as prerequisite reliable information on trends regarding withdrawals and recharge by percolation and seepage is needed this study aims at a detailed spatial analysis of the development of irrigation infrastructure canal and groundwater irrigation systems and to spatially detect changes in the irrigated areas in the ukc at decadal year time steps 1991 2001 and 2011 as detailed and direct information on water quantities used in the irrigation schemes is missing information on the spatio temporal development of irrigated areas provided by this study can be used as a starting point towards more comprehensive modeling and assessment of irrigation water balances based on the spatio temporal dynamics of irrigated areas extensive groundwater irrigated area with less recharge from percolation losses in irrigation canals was identified the output of the study can be beneficially used for i enhancing the understanding of usage of canal and groundwater for irrigation in terms of spatio temporal trends ii detecting eventual hotspot areas sites with a high risk towards groundwater overexploitation iii providing input into surface water and groundwater modeling thus a contribution towards facilitating appropriate adaptive and integrated land and water resources management in the study area is undertaken 2 study area the study area upper kharun catchment ukc is a part of the seonath sub basin a tributary of mahanadi river basin it lies between 20 33 30 n 21 22 05 n latitude and 81 17 53 e 81 45 17 e longitude ukc covers an area of approx 2486km2 and stretches across raipur durg and dhamtari districts of chhattisgarh state india the topography is flat with an elevation difference of 198m over a distance of around 90km from south to north fig 1 ukc is situated in chhattisgarh plains zone and experiences three typical indian seasons namely winter summer and monsoon the climate is tropical hot and humid type and average annual rainfall amounts to 1100mm the ukc covers diverse land use types i e urban rural agricultural forest and industrial areas the majority of the study area is agricultural land 77 6 the main crop grown in the area is paddy rice four major soil types are found in the ukc namely alfisols loam also known as dorsa vertisols clay also known as kanhar entisols sandy loam also known as bhata and inceptisols sandy clay loam also known as matasi the discharge measuring station patharidith located at northern part of ukc is defining the study area ukc was selected as study site because it represents a typical in terms of processes and drastic in terms of the magnitude and dynamics of the processes example of regions confronted with i rapid land use dynamics including highly water demanding extension and intensification of irrigation ii limited water resources becoming even more variable due to climate change and iii being the home of a population with irrigated agriculture providing livelihoods 2 1 cropping pattern and respective irrigation demand in upper kharun catchment as the seasons and crops drive developing of irrigation infrastructure and areas as well as strategies respective information is summarized in this section the three seasons in the ukc i e monsoon spring winter and summer feature cultivation of typical crops 2 1 1 monsoon season crops the main crop grown during this period is paddy rice more than 90 of agricultural land during the monsoon period has been allocated to paddy cultivation over the decades paddy cultivation is water demanding and therefore the demand exceeding the rainfall period july september needs to be supplemented by irrigation from canal networks according to the reports of cgwb 2012 the amount of canal water applied to paddy fields during the monsoon season september october november amounts to 300mm in the ukc the areas featuring sufficient groundwater availability also utilize groundwater irrigation during the monsoon period for paddy field preparation 100 150mm of groundwater is applied during this period based on field surveys and interviews with local farmers 2 1 2 winter season or post monsoon season crops depending on the groundwater depth a second crop may be produced in respective parts of the study area in tendency groundwater availability is better in the southern part of the ukc and there in the vicinity of the kharun river therefore two or three crops are more common in the south of the ukc the winter crops are mustard lentils pulses vegetables etc the amount of groundwater required for these crops is between 200 and 300mm derived from field surveys and interviews with local farmers in some parts of the study area shallow groundwater and black soils enable cultivation of a second crop without groundwater irrigation less water demanding crops lentils etc use the residual moisture available after the harvest of the paddy crop 2 1 3 summer crops in the case of sufficient groundwater availability only paddy crops are cultivated the amount of groundwater utilized for paddy cultivation during the summer season is estimated to be 640mm cgwb report 2012 short duration paddy crops 90days are generally cultivated from mid february to mid may 2 2 main canal systems and major features of the canal system in ukc as the configuration of the main canal systems and the basic features of the canal operation ease the understanding of methods for analyzing changes in surface and groundwater irrigated areas respective information is provided in the following 2 2 1 configuration by main canal systems 2 2 1 1 tandula canal system the tandula reservoir complex has an overall command area of nearly 3000km2 it is a part of the mahanadi basin and embodies three reservoirs i e tandula gudhli and kharkhara tandula command area is mostly located in durg district and bounded by kharun river in the east it also gets water from pt ravishankar reservoir gangral through the mahanadi feeder canal fig 2 a and b a part of the tandula main canal is in the ukc it runs parallel to the western boundary of the ukc and has a length of approximately 74km from south to north direction in the ukc only the right side of the system feeds the ukc 2 2 1 2 mahanadi main canal system it originates from the pandit ravi shankar reservoir gangrel at rudri dhamtari block and runs parallel to the eastern boundary over a length of approximately 49km from south to north only the left side of the canal system feeds the ukc the blocks under this irrigation system are dhamtari and kurud 2 2 1 3 mandhar branch system it originates from the mahanadi main canal system at 49 26km cutoff and feeds abhanpur and dharsiwa block raipur is supplied by this branch system it has a length of approximately 49km from south to north only distributaries on the left side of the mandhar branch provide water to the ukc the length of some distributaries and minors in this system has been reduced over the years because of the expansion and outgrowth of urban aggrolomates around raipur 2 2 1 4 mahanadi feeder canal system mfc it connects pt ravi shankar reservoir gangral to the tandula main canal it is running throughout the year and has a length of approximately 42km from east to west direction in the southern part of the ukc it feeds the whole block of gurur and parts of dhamtari and balod blocks 2 2 2 major features of the system operation the canal system supplies water primarily for irrigation it also contributes to meet the requirements of industries and urban areas during each year the canal systems are only operated in late monsoon and post monsoon season september october november for 2 3 months depending on the water demand based on information collected from irrigation reports expert interviews and field visits 60days are considered as a plausible operational period in this study in summer may the mahanadi main canal is operated for 12 15days only to supply water to kharun river ponds and tanks to meet the requirements of the raipur urban area the mahanadi feeder canal and tandula main canal are operated throughout the year to supply water to the industrial area bhilai steel plant maroda tank 3 materials and methods the surface and groundwater dynamics in the ukc are strongly influenced by the development of irrigation infrastructure and its operation in order to improve understanding of these surface and groundwater dynamics an in depth study on the spatio temporal development of the irrigation systems were performed with following major features the size as well as the location of irrigated areas were analyzed explicitly taking into account the water source used reservoir water from outside the ukc imported and provided by canals versus groundwater withdrawn from aquifers within the ukc and seasonality monsoon non monsoon summer and winter seasons with respect to temporal dimension the analyses were carried out for decadal time steps represented by the years 1991 2001 and 2011 these years were selected in order to cover the time span of major changes in irrigated areas and water sources used trend towards groundwater use and because of availability of reliable data referring to the spatial dimension of the approach information gained at village level was determined as starting point and then further summarized and aggregated at block and ukc level to that end an approach was developed integrating data and their analyses from i the census book collected from the department of population and dynamics raipur ii irrigation reports and canal network map collected from the irrigation departments at raipur rudri and durg iii satellite data information landsat satellite images collected at three different seasons for 1991 2001 and 2011 iv field visits and v expert interviews detail description of input data and the data sources are presented in supplementary table 1a the methodology consists of three major steps 1 spatial mapping of canal network systems and spatial extent and dynamics of areas irrigated by canal system in the ukc at decadal year 1991 2001 and 2011 2 spatial mapping of groundwater irrigated area extent and dynamics over the decades 1991 2001 and 2011 3 threshold criteria for canal water and groundwater irrigated area mapping according to these steps the description of the detailed methods is structured in the following sections 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 3 1 spatial mapping of canal infrastructure and irrigated area extent cultivable command area cca development in the ukc over the decades 1991 2001 and 2011 irrigation water for schemes supplied by canals in the ukc is provided by and released from the tandula and the gangral reservoirs which receive runoff generated in areas outside the ukc the irrigation water is conveyed into and distributed within the ukc by a well developed system of irrigation canal networks with main canals along the western eastern and southern borders of the catchment the canal physical infrastructure and cultivable command area cca mapping were done for 3 time steps 2011 2001 and 1991 at the first stage 2011 canal irrigated maps were prepared that serves as a basis for the preparation of canal irrigated maps of 2001 and 1991 as a first step the canal network maps of 2011 index map showing distributaries and minors their names and length were procured from the irrigation department at raipur rudri and durg they were scanned digitized attributed and georeferenced in arc gis 10 1 visual interpretation of landsat images 2011 google earth images and field visits information were used to cross check the canal network maps the investigation shows a high accuracy match of the digitized canal network maps with field data and satellite images later the digitized canal networks were overlaid on the ukc boundary and only those reaches of main canals distributaries and minors were considered that were exactly inside the ukc boundary and irrigated areas in the ukc subsequently the village boundaries map was overlaid on canal network maps and the spatial location of canal infrastructure that lies inside the village boundaries were identified and mapped in the next step normalized difference vegetation index ndvi maps derived from the landsat image september 2011 visual interpretation of landsat images september 2011 and the village wise canal irrigation report 2011 information were utilized to spatially identify and demarcate the canal irrigated areas extent within the villages having canal infrastructure the canal network map of 2011 served as a basis for preparing the canal network map of 2001 a copy of the map of 2011 was overlaid onto the landsat satellite images of 2001 afterwards a visual interpretation was conducted and the fraction of main canal network not existed on 2001 images were deleted however because of the spatial resolution of landsat 30m it is difficult to identify the distributaries and minors for this village wise irrigation reports based on canal irrigation sources for 2001 were used as a proxy to detect the spatial existence of distributaries and minors at village level in 2001 if the irrigation reports show no canal irrigation for a particular village then the fraction of distributary or minor existed in 2011 map was deleted the irrigated area extent of 2001 were demarcated using ndvi september 2001 and village irrigation report similar to 2011 the canal infrastructure created and cca during 1991 were similarly spotted and mapped a copy of the 2001 canal network map was edited based on landsat satellite images september 1991 and village wise irrigation report of 1991 3 2 spatial mapping of groundwater irrigated area extent and dynamics in the ukc over the decades 1991 2001 and 2011 canal irrigation is operational only during the monsoon and post monsoon september october november period in ukc hence crops grown during winter december january and pre monsoon april may period are supported by groundwater irrigation only using the visual interpretation of landsat images ndvi and village groundwater irrigation reports the spatial extent of cropped area during winter and pre monsoon period in 1991 2001 and 2011 were identified and mapped since the irrigation source in this period is groundwater hence the developed maps are considered as groundwater irrigated areas paddy is a major crop grown in ukc more than 90 of agricultural land during the monsoon period has been allocated to paddy cultivation over the decades whereas during winter and summer period the shallow groundwater table areas in the southern part of the ukc takes two or three crops as paddy using groundwater irrigation during the field preparation the standing water water layer in the field is visible in landsat imageries that provides and additional information for spatial demarcation of ground water irrigated areas fig 3 3 3 threshold criteria for canal water and groundwater irrigated area mapping the spatial resolution of all the irrigation maps are 30m similar to landsat image resolution the irrigated area extent was analyzed for each village because the irrigation reports are available at village level and subsequently the village irrigation statistics were aggregated to block level threshold criteria of 35 ha was fixed because of the following reasons a canal irrigation it has been analyzed that on average around 25 35ha of land per village in ukc is irrigated by ponds and or river in the respective villages hence to differentiate it with canal irrigation a threshold of 35ha irrigated area per village was fixed which indicates if the area is irrigated more than the threshold limit then obviously the source of irrigation is canal networks b groundwater irrigation irrigation through ponds and or river is also evident in winter and pre monsoon conditions and so with respect to the above given analyses on canal irrigation and to be in line with these analyses a threshold criterion of again 35ha for exploring groundwater irrigation was set threshold criteria of 75 ha was fixed for identifying the hotspots of excessive groundwater withdrawal areas because of the following reason the average irrigated area per village is 190 200ha hence a threshold criteria of 75ha was set to show the villages which utilized groundwater to irrigate more than one third 37 5 of their irrigated area in winter and pre monsoon period and termed as hot spots of high groundwater withdrawal 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial analysis of canal system irrigated areas and irrigation dynamics in the ukc between decadal years 1991 2001 and 2011 a changes in the number of villages village wise irrigation statistics for the decadal years 1991 2001 and 2011 were analyzed the number of villages irrigated from canal and groundwater irrigation were reported separately per block number of canal irrigated villages in ukc area irrigated by more than 35ha village using canal water is shown in table 1 in all blocks except the dharsiwa block the number of villages in the command area irrigation by canal network increased over the years from 1991 to 2011 the largest increase is observed for patan and gurur blocks where the number of villages benefitting from the canal network increased to 25 and 19 respectively table 1 dharsiwa raipur is a single block where the extent of irrigated area and canal infrastructure decreased over the years the reason is the rapid development of urban outgrowth driven mainly by raipur as the new capital city of chhattisgarh and resulting in conversion of irrigated area to urban area one distributor no 8 from the mandhar branch decreased considerably due to industrial and settlement growth in and around raipur city the changes in number of villages with surface water irrigation correspond with a development of the canal irrigation infrastructure however at present 103 villages 17 2 area in the ukc have no canal infrastructure this needs serious consideration by the policy makers to find a plausible solution to provide irrigation facilities to those villages fig 4 a c visualize the development of canal infrastructure in 1991 2001 and 2011 respectively b changes in the share of canal irrigated area in the ukc the analysis results show that the canal irrigation area in the ukc increased over the years except for the dharsiwa block fig 5 a b the canal infrastructure has been developed and the area under surface irrigation increased by 8 6 from 1991 to 2001 and by 5 9 from 2001 to 2011 the total increase from 1991 to 2011 was 14 5 4 2 analysis of groundwater irrigated area extent and irrigation dynamics in the ukc between decadal years 1991 2001 and 2011 a changes in the number of villages in all blocks the number of villages utilizing groundwater sources for irrigation increased significantly a strong increase in the number of villages utilizing groundwater can be observed for patan block followed by gurur kurud dhamtari and dhamdha during the past two decades 1991 2011 there was an increase of 180 villages around 30 of study area withdrawing groundwater resources for irrigation in the ukc table 2 this indicates an alarming situation and careful management of groundwater resources is advocated to ensure sustainability of this resource b changes in the share of groundwater irrigated area in the ukc groundwater irrigation area in the ukc is increasing over the years pressure towards higher agricultural production driven by population growth in a situation with improved irrigation and electricity facilities and availability of modern pumping devices can explain such expansion it was observed that the area under groundwater irrigation increased by 9 5 from 1991 to 2001 and an increase by 12 5 from 2001 to 2011 while it grew by 22 0 between 1991 and 2011 fig 6 a b the most distinct increase of groundwater irrigation area was detected in the dhamtari block followed by kurud dhamdha and gurur at present almost 30 of the area of the ukc relies on groundwater irrigation especially the upward trend of groundwater use creates the need to study the sustainable management of the groundwater resources in the area 4 3 analysis of irrigated area dynamics considering irrigation water sources at ukc in 1991 2001 and 2011 a analysis at ukc level the extent of irrigated areas based on the irrigation sources were determined at village level and subsequently aggregated to block and ukc level the times step considered were the decadal years of 1991 2001 and 2011 in 1991 43 1 of the area of the ukc was irrigated by both canal and groundwater out of which 35 2 was irrigated by canal water whereas only 7 9 area was irrigated by groundwater however the percentage of area irrigated by groundwater during the monsoon was 3 4 and during the non monsoon period 4 5 fig 7 in 2001 61 1 of the ukc utilized by both canal and groundwater sources 43 8 of area relied on canal water and 17 3 area was irrigated by groundwater the percentage of area irrigated by groundwater during the monsoon was 6 5 whereas the share of area irrigated by groundwater in the non monsoon period amounted to 10 8 fig 7 in 2011 79 5 of total geographical area of the ukc was irrigated by both canal and groundwater sources 49 7 of area was fed by canal water whereas 29 8 was irrigated by groundwater the share of area irrigated by groundwater in the monsoon was 10 4 whereas 19 4 of the area was irrigated by groundwater in the non monsoon period fig 7 it is evident from fig 7 that the extent of irrigated area has almost doubled between 1991 and 2011 the percentage of canal water irrigation has increased by 14 5 whereas an even higher increase of groundwater irrigation by 21 9 was revealed between 1991 and 2011 the analysis results reveal an upward trend of the total irrigated area in the ukc from 1991 to 2011 the area under both canal and groundwater irrigation increased by 18 0 from 1991 to 2001 by 18 4 from 2001 to 2011 and by 36 4 from 1991 to 2011 fig 8 b b analysis at block level there was a major expansion in the total irrigation area both canal and groundwater between 1991 and 2011 for dhamtari block 66 7 increase followed by kurud 59 4 increase dhamdha 42 4 increase balod 40 3 increase patan 33 2 increase and gurur 30 4 increase fig 8a b 4 4 spatial analysis of extensive groundwater irrigation areas in the ukc in 2011 in 2011 a total of 216 villages out of 599 were determined as the villages withdrawing extensive groundwater resources for irrigation i e the villages with a threshold of more than 75ha of its area irrigated by groundwater fig 9 this information is useful to locate the hotspot areas of excessive groundwater extraction it was found that the areas along the kharun river and many villages in dhamtari district in south are utilizing excessively groundwater irrigation the reason is the shallow groundwater in these areas compared to the other parts in ukc which facilitates the excessive withdrawal however a water balance analysis of groundwater recharge and withdrawal monitoring and modeling needs to be concentrated spatially on these hotspot areas such information would be useful for decision makers and government officials to frame strategies for sustainable management of water resources in the ukc 4 5 spatial mapping of combined irrigated and non irrigated areas in the ukc in 2011 in 2011 the area irrigated by canal and or groundwater and non irrigated areas in the ukc is shown in fig 10 ny represents those areas which receive canal irrigation water that comes from outside the ukc and use negligible or quite less groundwater for irrigation hence these areas receive groundwater recharge from losses in irrigation canals in addition to natural recharge resulting from rainfall during the monsoon season yn represents hotpot areas where groundwater withdrawal is high irrigation area more than 75ha per village and no canal irrigation is practiced in terms of the impact on the groundwater balance canal and groundwater irrigated areas feature clear differences canal water is imported from outside the ukc and irrigation losses are an additional recharge water gain to the groundwater system in the ukc whereas groundwater irrigated areas use groundwater as an internal resource in the ukc thus groundwater areas classified by yn potentially are hotspot areas deserving high attention in monitoring modeling and water management in order to ensure sustainable management of groundwater resources 5 conclusions and recommendations featuring a huge extension as a well as a distinct intensification of irrigation mainly driven by the need to fulfill the rising food demand of a quickly growing population undergoing a tremendous increase of withdrawals from groundwater and facing an advancing processes of urbanization and industrialization the ukc is a typical example for many basins worldwide becoming exposed to water stress yet due to very high population growth and establishing raipur as capital of the new state chhattisgarh the dynamics of these processes are comparably high therefore ukc is a typical example with a drastic magnitude of dynamics which is visualizing the typical situation like under a burning glass a further typical characteristic of ukc representing many basins especially in developing countries is the contrast between an urgent need for action in terms of water management strategies infrastructure and the non availability of sufficient data on water use as well as on demand in order to contribute to mitigate this challenging situation we developed an approach which is combining information from different sources at different scales official statistics remote sensing field surveys expert knowledge on i extension of irrigated areas ii intensification of irrigation iii water source used canal versus groundwater and iv water applied referring to seasons and crops the approach enabled to detect important trends with respect to dynamic development of irrigated areas and water sources used areas irrigated with canal water increased between 1991 and 2011 from 35 2 up to 49 7 of the total size of the ukc accordingly the number of villages access to the canal systems has been increased yet still around 17 2 of villages are not linked to the canal system expansion of groundwater irrigated areas was even higher with an increase from 7 9 72 villages utilizing gwi in 1991 to 29 8 252 villages utilizing gwi in 2011 which was strongly driven by groundwater based irrigation in the non monsoon season as a consequence of the pressure on food production for the growing population and eased by availability of pumping facilities and subsidies on electricity in spatial dimension groundwater irrigation is expanding mainly in the southern part of the ukc dhamtari kurud dhamdha and gurur blocks and there especially in the vicinity of the kharun rivers as these sites provide rather easily accessible groundwater aquifers sites being prone to deplete aquifers hotspots were delineated by overlaying areas with a rather high share of groundwater based irrigation and missing canal irrigation and in turn missing groundwater recharge from losses in the canal system conveying water imported from outside the ukc in order to make best use of the existing water infrastructure described by the size of irrigated areas and their dynamics by our approach and to cope with potentially disadvantageous consequences of the above mentioned trends refined water management concepts consisting of interventions in terms of advanced strategies and further developing and or re arranging of infrastructure are required yet as a prerequisite for working out these concepts a substantial improvement of the data situation is necessary purposeful intensification of the groundwater monitoring systems and application of groundwater models are the major tools for providing this additional information the findings of our study can be utilized for conclusions towards facilitating to conceive and apply these tools hotspot areas delineated in our analyses can support to target the intensification of groundwater monitoring systems these sites are at risk towards over exploitation of groundwater resources and therefore require enhancement of groundwater data availability dynamics of irrigated areas in terms of size irrigation intensity and source of irrigation water provided by our study deliver useful information for estimating the percolation and in turn the groundwater recharge which is a key input into groundwater modeling groundwater modeling is needed to extrapolate the trend in groundwater levels under the influence of scenarios on future development of irrigation and in order to conceive strategies to counterbalance over exploitation knowledge on the recharge from irrigated areas and its dependency from irrigation infrastructure and strategies is not only important due to the magnitude of that component but also because of the fact that percolation from irrigated areas can be influenced by water management interventions for example raising irrigation efficiency supporting changes in cropping pattern what is hardly possible with recharge from rainfall results to be achieved by intensified monitoring and groundwater modeling facilitated by findings from our study as argued for in the above paragraphs will have the potential to advance water management towards more sustainable strategies of water use yet the results of our study enable already to suggest following conclusions on water management strategies future strategies need to consider the inter relationships between groundwater and canal based irrigation irrigation water in the canal system is released from reservoirs outside the ukc and therefore losses in the canal system are an additional recharge to groundwater in the 1990s this additional recharge via irrigation water losses from outside as an input into the groundwater system in the ukc and withdrawals from the groundwater in the ukc for irrigation as an output from ukc s groundwater system were balanced strong expansion and intensification of groundwater based irrigation compared to the increase in canal based irrigation is resulting in an unbalanced situation in the sense that output from the aquifers via pumping is exceeding recharge from losses in imported canal water which in tendency and especially in the above mentioned hotspot areas lead to aquifer depletion as a consequence upgrading of the canal system in areas not yet linked as identified and localized in our study could be considered taking eventual obstacles topography into account furthermore strategies towards higher efficiency and productivity in irrigation water use should be considered including improved irrigation schedules advanced handling of irrigation water application support to farmers in terms of advice and cooperation incentives for water saving tackling the input side of the groundwater system in the ukc it could be considered to strengthen decentral storage options in the southern part of the ukc for enhancing groundwater recharge along the kharun river in order to counterbalance the withdrawals in these areas most intensively used for groundwater based irrigation there has been no such detailed research performed on the changes in irrigated areas based on the sources canal and groundwater in ukc which is one of the most important economically sound and highly populated catchments of chhattisgarh state given the high importance and urgent need for such analyses in the study area the results of this research in a highly valuable way can facilitate the introduction of best water and land use management practices in the ukc based on the findings from intensified monitoring and groundwater modeling as suggested above these interventions could be a component of integrated concepts to be embedded in the socio economic and institutional context yet as a first step in adaptive water management the above mentioned interventions could be conceived and considered for stepwise implementation acknowledgements the

11592,the upper kharun catchment ukc which is part of the new state chhattisgarh formed in 2000 features considerable population growth expansion of urban areas and dynamic changes in irrigation infrastructure as well as irrigation practices spatial extension temporal intensification increasing use of groundwater as source for meeting the increasing food demand water intensive rice is the major crop of the area ukc has a comprehensive canal irrigation system which provides the link to water supply from reservoirs fed from areas outside the ukc however water provision for irrigation via the canal system for irrigation is restricted to only post monsoon season as a consequence groundwater remains the only source of irrigation water in summer and winter seasons improved electricity facilities and subsidy on groundwater pumping have triggered an enormous increase in groundwater withdrawals remote sensing satellite images along with ground observed data were used in this study to spatially identify the areas with canal and groundwater irrigation results reveal that in 2011 around 50 of the area of the ukc benefits from canal irrigation whereas 29 8 area is irrigated by groundwater around 103 villages in the ukc have no canal infrastructures 216 villages in ukc are considered as hotspot areas because of high groundwater withdrawal irrigated area exceeding 75 ha per village there has been threefold increase in groundwater irrigated area in ukc between 1991 and 2011 the upward trend of groundwater use indicates an alarming situation towards over exploitation and creates the need to provide and analyze data on the use of groundwater resources in the area in order to detect past and to estimate future trends referring to groundwater withdrawals these data are a prerequisite for enabling careful and foresightful management of groundwater resources especially at spatially identified hotspot areas towards ensuring sustainable management of this resource keywords canal irrigation groundwater irrigation irrigation dynamics hotspot areas over exploitation and spatial analysis 1 introduction agriculture is by far the biggest consumer of water in india more than 85 of india s freshwater is withdrawn by agriculture alone and according to the ministry of water resources it is expected that the irrigation needs will increase by 56 by the year 2050 while the demand for drinking water will double and the water demand for energy production will increase 16 fold asian development bank 2003 irrigation systems in india rely on canal and groundwater according to agricultural census 2010 11 india s total area under irrigation is 64 7 million hectares tube well irrigation contributes to 45 of total share followed by canal irrigation 26 despite of heavy investment in canal infrastructure creation the indian government has not been able to reduce the groundwater depletion the area irrigated with groundwater and its share of total irrigated area shows an increasing trend over time chatterjee 2012 szakonyi and urpelainen 2013 three major reasons drive this trend i rather low canal irrigation efficiency inadequate and unreliable supply hinder actually full or appropriate utilization of the canal irrigation potential ii subsidies in electricity and development in groundwater pumping devices ease groundwater use as an option to overcome the gap according i between actual and potential usage of irrigated lands iii groundwater based irrigation is seen as an option for agricultural production during periods when canal systems are not operated india has emerged as the biggest consumer of groundwater in the world with estimated annual withdrawals of 230km3 cgwb 2014 groundwater irrigation in india covers more than 50 of total irrigated area responsible for 70 of agricultural production and providing livelihood for 50 of the indian population world bank 1998 shah 2010 this extremely high groundwater withdrawal rate is depleting aquifers across the country and declining water table at faster rates than ever before in fact the rates of depletion in india are probably the highest in the world aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 this trend towards unsustainable water management is especially alarming in a country where livelihoods mainly depend on irrigated agriculture and groundwater resources are needed to meet the increasing demand for drinking water rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 livingston 2009 shah 2009 fishman 2011 devineni et al 2013 and russo et al 2013 given this situation there is an urgent need to immediately take appropriate measures to strengthen sustainable management of groundwater via either reducing withdrawals or enhancing recharge rates otherwise several regions in india will face a drastic reduction in agricultural production loss of employment and socio economic stresses there is huge uncertainty in the actual area irrigated the location of irrigated areas and the irrigation strategies water sources timing and intensity of use which leads to uncertainties in estimates of actual water use by irrigation and in turn contributes to mis management of water resources in india the irrigated areas are reported based on census data collected at village level later aggregated to block district state and national level reddy et al 2006 such a process is highly labor extensive and time consuming and the quality of the compiled data is not always reliable biggs et al 2006 droogers 2002 however advancement in satellite remote sensing offers a tremendous potential for continuous monitoring and mapping of irrigated areas due to the availability of satellite imageries at different spatio temporal scales lenney et al 1996 de fries et al 1998 lobell et al 2003 thenkabail et al 2005 2009 ozdogan and gutman 2008 alexandridis et al 2008 the mapping of spatio temporal dynamics of irrigated areas is a key to understand the drivers of change and spatially identify and locate the hotspot regions at high risk of over exploitation due to extensive and unsustainable groundwater irrigation the mapping of canal infrastructure explores the areas where the potential benefits of canal system are still not reached and also reveals the gaps or bottlenecks in the irrigation systems chhattisgarh state is known as the rice bowl of india traditionally rice is grown as a single main monsoon crop yet there is an increasing tendency towards taking rice up as a winter and or summer crop at sites where sufficient groundwater is available to meet the water demand rice is grown in basins which are permanently or at least for a high share of the vegetation period flooded with a water layer as a consequence the gap between rainfall and crop water requirements plus losses by percolation and seepage has to be matched by irrigation water input therefore rice cultivation is requiring a high amount of water which is supplied either by canals from reservoirs or withdrawn from groundwater sources the upper kharun catchment ukc is a part of chhattisgarh state featuring high population growth considerable expansion of urban areas ongoing industrialization and dynamic changes in irrigation practices extension intensification and increasing use of groundwater for meeting the rising food demand ukc has a comprehensive canal irrigation system which provides the link to water supply from reservoirs fed from runoff generated outside upstream the ukc and enables conveyance and distribution of irrigation water within the ukc however water provision for irrigation via the canal system for irrigation is restricted to only post monsoon season september to november during the summer and winter seasons the irrigation water demand of crops can be met by groundwater resources only according to the cgwb report 2012 the expansion of groundwater irrigated areas in chhattisgarh increased 6 fold from 2001 to 2010 and as a result groundwater resources are at the risk of being over exploited for irrigation purposes at least in parts of the chhattisgarh the local people stick to their traditional practice of paddy cultivation which is highly water demanding moreover the government of chhattisgarh is providing subsidies for electricity to pump groundwater for paddy cultivation the practice of over exploitation of precious groundwater resources may lead to a major water crisis in the near future and therefore careful management is essential and as prerequisite reliable information on trends regarding withdrawals and recharge by percolation and seepage is needed this study aims at a detailed spatial analysis of the development of irrigation infrastructure canal and groundwater irrigation systems and to spatially detect changes in the irrigated areas in the ukc at decadal year time steps 1991 2001 and 2011 as detailed and direct information on water quantities used in the irrigation schemes is missing information on the spatio temporal development of irrigated areas provided by this study can be used as a starting point towards more comprehensive modeling and assessment of irrigation water balances based on the spatio temporal dynamics of irrigated areas extensive groundwater irrigated area with less recharge from percolation losses in irrigation canals was identified the output of the study can be beneficially used for i enhancing the understanding of usage of canal and groundwater for irrigation in terms of spatio temporal trends ii detecting eventual hotspot areas sites with a high risk towards groundwater overexploitation iii providing input into surface water and groundwater modeling thus a contribution towards facilitating appropriate adaptive and integrated land and water resources management in the study area is undertaken 2 study area the study area upper kharun catchment ukc is a part of the seonath sub basin a tributary of mahanadi river basin it lies between 20 33 30 n 21 22 05 n latitude and 81 17 53 e 81 45 17 e longitude ukc covers an area of approx 2486km2 and stretches across raipur durg and dhamtari districts of chhattisgarh state india the topography is flat with an elevation difference of 198m over a distance of around 90km from south to north fig 1 ukc is situated in chhattisgarh plains zone and experiences three typical indian seasons namely winter summer and monsoon the climate is tropical hot and humid type and average annual rainfall amounts to 1100mm the ukc covers diverse land use types i e urban rural agricultural forest and industrial areas the majority of the study area is agricultural land 77 6 the main crop grown in the area is paddy rice four major soil types are found in the ukc namely alfisols loam also known as dorsa vertisols clay also known as kanhar entisols sandy loam also known as bhata and inceptisols sandy clay loam also known as matasi the discharge measuring station patharidith located at northern part of ukc is defining the study area ukc was selected as study site because it represents a typical in terms of processes and drastic in terms of the magnitude and dynamics of the processes example of regions confronted with i rapid land use dynamics including highly water demanding extension and intensification of irrigation ii limited water resources becoming even more variable due to climate change and iii being the home of a population with irrigated agriculture providing livelihoods 2 1 cropping pattern and respective irrigation demand in upper kharun catchment as the seasons and crops drive developing of irrigation infrastructure and areas as well as strategies respective information is summarized in this section the three seasons in the ukc i e monsoon spring winter and summer feature cultivation of typical crops 2 1 1 monsoon season crops the main crop grown during this period is paddy rice more than 90 of agricultural land during the monsoon period has been allocated to paddy cultivation over the decades paddy cultivation is water demanding and therefore the demand exceeding the rainfall period july september needs to be supplemented by irrigation from canal networks according to the reports of cgwb 2012 the amount of canal water applied to paddy fields during the monsoon season september october november amounts to 300mm in the ukc the areas featuring sufficient groundwater availability also utilize groundwater irrigation during the monsoon period for paddy field preparation 100 150mm of groundwater is applied during this period based on field surveys and interviews with local farmers 2 1 2 winter season or post monsoon season crops depending on the groundwater depth a second crop may be produced in respective parts of the study area in tendency groundwater availability is better in the southern part of the ukc and there in the vicinity of the kharun river therefore two or three crops are more common in the south of the ukc the winter crops are mustard lentils pulses vegetables etc the amount of groundwater required for these crops is between 200 and 300mm derived from field surveys and interviews with local farmers in some parts of the study area shallow groundwater and black soils enable cultivation of a second crop without groundwater irrigation less water demanding crops lentils etc use the residual moisture available after the harvest of the paddy crop 2 1 3 summer crops in the case of sufficient groundwater availability only paddy crops are cultivated the amount of groundwater utilized for paddy cultivation during the summer season is estimated to be 640mm cgwb report 2012 short duration paddy crops 90days are generally cultivated from mid february to mid may 2 2 main canal systems and major features of the canal system in ukc as the configuration of the main canal systems and the basic features of the canal operation ease the understanding of methods for analyzing changes in surface and groundwater irrigated areas respective information is provided in the following 2 2 1 configuration by main canal systems 2 2 1 1 tandula canal system the tandula reservoir complex has an overall command area of nearly 3000km2 it is a part of the mahanadi basin and embodies three reservoirs i e tandula gudhli and kharkhara tandula command area is mostly located in durg district and bounded by kharun river in the east it also gets water from pt ravishankar reservoir gangral through the mahanadi feeder canal fig 2 a and b a part of the tandula main canal is in the ukc it runs parallel to the western boundary of the ukc and has a length of approximately 74km from south to north direction in the ukc only the right side of the system feeds the ukc 2 2 1 2 mahanadi main canal system it originates from the pandit ravi shankar reservoir gangrel at rudri dhamtari block and runs parallel to the eastern boundary over a length of approximately 49km from south to north only the left side of the canal system feeds the ukc the blocks under this irrigation system are dhamtari and kurud 2 2 1 3 mandhar branch system it originates from the mahanadi main canal system at 49 26km cutoff and feeds abhanpur and dharsiwa block raipur is supplied by this branch system it has a length of approximately 49km from south to north only distributaries on the left side of the mandhar branch provide water to the ukc the length of some distributaries and minors in this system has been reduced over the years because of the expansion and outgrowth of urban aggrolomates around raipur 2 2 1 4 mahanadi feeder canal system mfc it connects pt ravi shankar reservoir gangral to the tandula main canal it is running throughout the year and has a length of approximately 42km from east to west direction in the southern part of the ukc it feeds the whole block of gurur and parts of dhamtari and balod blocks 2 2 2 major features of the system operation the canal system supplies water primarily for irrigation it also contributes to meet the requirements of industries and urban areas during each year the canal systems are only operated in late monsoon and post monsoon season september october november for 2 3 months depending on the water demand based on information collected from irrigation reports expert interviews and field visits 60days are considered as a plausible operational period in this study in summer may the mahanadi main canal is operated for 12 15days only to supply water to kharun river ponds and tanks to meet the requirements of the raipur urban area the mahanadi feeder canal and tandula main canal are operated throughout the year to supply water to the industrial area bhilai steel plant maroda tank 3 materials and methods the surface and groundwater dynamics in the ukc are strongly influenced by the development of irrigation infrastructure and its operation in order to improve understanding of these surface and groundwater dynamics an in depth study on the spatio temporal development of the irrigation systems were performed with following major features the size as well as the location of irrigated areas were analyzed explicitly taking into account the water source used reservoir water from outside the ukc imported and provided by canals versus groundwater withdrawn from aquifers within the ukc and seasonality monsoon non monsoon summer and winter seasons with respect to temporal dimension the analyses were carried out for decadal time steps represented by the years 1991 2001 and 2011 these years were selected in order to cover the time span of major changes in irrigated areas and water sources used trend towards groundwater use and because of availability of reliable data referring to the spatial dimension of the approach information gained at village level was determined as starting point and then further summarized and aggregated at block and ukc level to that end an approach was developed integrating data and their analyses from i the census book collected from the department of population and dynamics raipur ii irrigation reports and canal network map collected from the irrigation departments at raipur rudri and durg iii satellite data information landsat satellite images collected at three different seasons for 1991 2001 and 2011 iv field visits and v expert interviews detail description of input data and the data sources are presented in supplementary table 1a the methodology consists of three major steps 1 spatial mapping of canal network systems and spatial extent and dynamics of areas irrigated by canal system in the ukc at decadal year 1991 2001 and 2011 2 spatial mapping of groundwater irrigated area extent and dynamics over the decades 1991 2001 and 2011 3 threshold criteria for canal water and groundwater irrigated area mapping according to these steps the description of the detailed methods is structured in the following sections 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 3 1 spatial mapping of canal infrastructure and irrigated area extent cultivable command area cca development in the ukc over the decades 1991 2001 and 2011 irrigation water for schemes supplied by canals in the ukc is provided by and released from the tandula and the gangral reservoirs which receive runoff generated in areas outside the ukc the irrigation water is conveyed into and distributed within the ukc by a well developed system of irrigation canal networks with main canals along the western eastern and southern borders of the catchment the canal physical infrastructure and cultivable command area cca mapping were done for 3 time steps 2011 2001 and 1991 at the first stage 2011 canal irrigated maps were prepared that serves as a basis for the preparation of canal irrigated maps of 2001 and 1991 as a first step the canal network maps of 2011 index map showing distributaries and minors their names and length were procured from the irrigation department at raipur rudri and durg they were scanned digitized attributed and georeferenced in arc gis 10 1 visual interpretation of landsat images 2011 google earth images and field visits information were used to cross check the canal network maps the investigation shows a high accuracy match of the digitized canal network maps with field data and satellite images later the digitized canal networks were overlaid on the ukc boundary and only those reaches of main canals distributaries and minors were considered that were exactly inside the ukc boundary and irrigated areas in the ukc subsequently the village boundaries map was overlaid on canal network maps and the spatial location of canal infrastructure that lies inside the village boundaries were identified and mapped in the next step normalized difference vegetation index ndvi maps derived from the landsat image september 2011 visual interpretation of landsat images september 2011 and the village wise canal irrigation report 2011 information were utilized to spatially identify and demarcate the canal irrigated areas extent within the villages having canal infrastructure the canal network map of 2011 served as a basis for preparing the canal network map of 2001 a copy of the map of 2011 was overlaid onto the landsat satellite images of 2001 afterwards a visual interpretation was conducted and the fraction of main canal network not existed on 2001 images were deleted however because of the spatial resolution of landsat 30m it is difficult to identify the distributaries and minors for this village wise irrigation reports based on canal irrigation sources for 2001 were used as a proxy to detect the spatial existence of distributaries and minors at village level in 2001 if the irrigation reports show no canal irrigation for a particular village then the fraction of distributary or minor existed in 2011 map was deleted the irrigated area extent of 2001 were demarcated using ndvi september 2001 and village irrigation report similar to 2011 the canal infrastructure created and cca during 1991 were similarly spotted and mapped a copy of the 2001 canal network map was edited based on landsat satellite images september 1991 and village wise irrigation report of 1991 3 2 spatial mapping of groundwater irrigated area extent and dynamics in the ukc over the decades 1991 2001 and 2011 canal irrigation is operational only during the monsoon and post monsoon september october november period in ukc hence crops grown during winter december january and pre monsoon april may period are supported by groundwater irrigation only using the visual interpretation of landsat images ndvi and village groundwater irrigation reports the spatial extent of cropped area during winter and pre monsoon period in 1991 2001 and 2011 were identified and mapped since the irrigation source in this period is groundwater hence the developed maps are considered as groundwater irrigated areas paddy is a major crop grown in ukc more than 90 of agricultural land during the monsoon period has been allocated to paddy cultivation over the decades whereas during winter and summer period the shallow groundwater table areas in the southern part of the ukc takes two or three crops as paddy using groundwater irrigation during the field preparation the standing water water layer in the field is visible in landsat imageries that provides and additional information for spatial demarcation of ground water irrigated areas fig 3 3 3 threshold criteria for canal water and groundwater irrigated area mapping the spatial resolution of all the irrigation maps are 30m similar to landsat image resolution the irrigated area extent was analyzed for each village because the irrigation reports are available at village level and subsequently the village irrigation statistics were aggregated to block level threshold criteria of 35 ha was fixed because of the following reasons a canal irrigation it has been analyzed that on average around 25 35ha of land per village in ukc is irrigated by ponds and or river in the respective villages hence to differentiate it with canal irrigation a threshold of 35ha irrigated area per village was fixed which indicates if the area is irrigated more than the threshold limit then obviously the source of irrigation is canal networks b groundwater irrigation irrigation through ponds and or river is also evident in winter and pre monsoon conditions and so with respect to the above given analyses on canal irrigation and to be in line with these analyses a threshold criterion of again 35ha for exploring groundwater irrigation was set threshold criteria of 75 ha was fixed for identifying the hotspots of excessive groundwater withdrawal areas because of the following reason the average irrigated area per village is 190 200ha hence a threshold criteria of 75ha was set to show the villages which utilized groundwater to irrigate more than one third 37 5 of their irrigated area in winter and pre monsoon period and termed as hot spots of high groundwater withdrawal 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial analysis of canal system irrigated areas and irrigation dynamics in the ukc between decadal years 1991 2001 and 2011 a changes in the number of villages village wise irrigation statistics for the decadal years 1991 2001 and 2011 were analyzed the number of villages irrigated from canal and groundwater irrigation were reported separately per block number of canal irrigated villages in ukc area irrigated by more than 35ha village using canal water is shown in table 1 in all blocks except the dharsiwa block the number of villages in the command area irrigation by canal network increased over the years from 1991 to 2011 the largest increase is observed for patan and gurur blocks where the number of villages benefitting from the canal network increased to 25 and 19 respectively table 1 dharsiwa raipur is a single block where the extent of irrigated area and canal infrastructure decreased over the years the reason is the rapid development of urban outgrowth driven mainly by raipur as the new capital city of chhattisgarh and resulting in conversion of irrigated area to urban area one distributor no 8 from the mandhar branch decreased considerably due to industrial and settlement growth in and around raipur city the changes in number of villages with surface water irrigation correspond with a development of the canal irrigation infrastructure however at present 103 villages 17 2 area in the ukc have no canal infrastructure this needs serious consideration by the policy makers to find a plausible solution to provide irrigation facilities to those villages fig 4 a c visualize the development of canal infrastructure in 1991 2001 and 2011 respectively b changes in the share of canal irrigated area in the ukc the analysis results show that the canal irrigation area in the ukc increased over the years except for the dharsiwa block fig 5 a b the canal infrastructure has been developed and the area under surface irrigation increased by 8 6 from 1991 to 2001 and by 5 9 from 2001 to 2011 the total increase from 1991 to 2011 was 14 5 4 2 analysis of groundwater irrigated area extent and irrigation dynamics in the ukc between decadal years 1991 2001 and 2011 a changes in the number of villages in all blocks the number of villages utilizing groundwater sources for irrigation increased significantly a strong increase in the number of villages utilizing groundwater can be observed for patan block followed by gurur kurud dhamtari and dhamdha during the past two decades 1991 2011 there was an increase of 180 villages around 30 of study area withdrawing groundwater resources for irrigation in the ukc table 2 this indicates an alarming situation and careful management of groundwater resources is advocated to ensure sustainability of this resource b changes in the share of groundwater irrigated area in the ukc groundwater irrigation area in the ukc is increasing over the years pressure towards higher agricultural production driven by population growth in a situation with improved irrigation and electricity facilities and availability of modern pumping devices can explain such expansion it was observed that the area under groundwater irrigation increased by 9 5 from 1991 to 2001 and an increase by 12 5 from 2001 to 2011 while it grew by 22 0 between 1991 and 2011 fig 6 a b the most distinct increase of groundwater irrigation area was detected in the dhamtari block followed by kurud dhamdha and gurur at present almost 30 of the area of the ukc relies on groundwater irrigation especially the upward trend of groundwater use creates the need to study the sustainable management of the groundwater resources in the area 4 3 analysis of irrigated area dynamics considering irrigation water sources at ukc in 1991 2001 and 2011 a analysis at ukc level the extent of irrigated areas based on the irrigation sources were determined at village level and subsequently aggregated to block and ukc level the times step considered were the decadal years of 1991 2001 and 2011 in 1991 43 1 of the area of the ukc was irrigated by both canal and groundwater out of which 35 2 was irrigated by canal water whereas only 7 9 area was irrigated by groundwater however the percentage of area irrigated by groundwater during the monsoon was 3 4 and during the non monsoon period 4 5 fig 7 in 2001 61 1 of the ukc utilized by both canal and groundwater sources 43 8 of area relied on canal water and 17 3 area was irrigated by groundwater the percentage of area irrigated by groundwater during the monsoon was 6 5 whereas the share of area irrigated by groundwater in the non monsoon period amounted to 10 8 fig 7 in 2011 79 5 of total geographical area of the ukc was irrigated by both canal and groundwater sources 49 7 of area was fed by canal water whereas 29 8 was irrigated by groundwater the share of area irrigated by groundwater in the monsoon was 10 4 whereas 19 4 of the area was irrigated by groundwater in the non monsoon period fig 7 it is evident from fig 7 that the extent of irrigated area has almost doubled between 1991 and 2011 the percentage of canal water irrigation has increased by 14 5 whereas an even higher increase of groundwater irrigation by 21 9 was revealed between 1991 and 2011 the analysis results reveal an upward trend of the total irrigated area in the ukc from 1991 to 2011 the area under both canal and groundwater irrigation increased by 18 0 from 1991 to 2001 by 18 4 from 2001 to 2011 and by 36 4 from 1991 to 2011 fig 8 b b analysis at block level there was a major expansion in the total irrigation area both canal and groundwater between 1991 and 2011 for dhamtari block 66 7 increase followed by kurud 59 4 increase dhamdha 42 4 increase balod 40 3 increase patan 33 2 increase and gurur 30 4 increase fig 8a b 4 4 spatial analysis of extensive groundwater irrigation areas in the ukc in 2011 in 2011 a total of 216 villages out of 599 were determined as the villages withdrawing extensive groundwater resources for irrigation i e the villages with a threshold of more than 75ha of its area irrigated by groundwater fig 9 this information is useful to locate the hotspot areas of excessive groundwater extraction it was found that the areas along the kharun river and many villages in dhamtari district in south are utilizing excessively groundwater irrigation the reason is the shallow groundwater in these areas compared to the other parts in ukc which facilitates the excessive withdrawal however a water balance analysis of groundwater recharge and withdrawal monitoring and modeling needs to be concentrated spatially on these hotspot areas such information would be useful for decision makers and government officials to frame strategies for sustainable management of water resources in the ukc 4 5 spatial mapping of combined irrigated and non irrigated areas in the ukc in 2011 in 2011 the area irrigated by canal and or groundwater and non irrigated areas in the ukc is shown in fig 10 ny represents those areas which receive canal irrigation water that comes from outside the ukc and use negligible or quite less groundwater for irrigation hence these areas receive groundwater recharge from losses in irrigation canals in addition to natural recharge resulting from rainfall during the monsoon season yn represents hotpot areas where groundwater withdrawal is high irrigation area more than 75ha per village and no canal irrigation is practiced in terms of the impact on the groundwater balance canal and groundwater irrigated areas feature clear differences canal water is imported from outside the ukc and irrigation losses are an additional recharge water gain to the groundwater system in the ukc whereas groundwater irrigated areas use groundwater as an internal resource in the ukc thus groundwater areas classified by yn potentially are hotspot areas deserving high attention in monitoring modeling and water management in order to ensure sustainable management of groundwater resources 5 conclusions and recommendations featuring a huge extension as a well as a distinct intensification of irrigation mainly driven by the need to fulfill the rising food demand of a quickly growing population undergoing a tremendous increase of withdrawals from groundwater and facing an advancing processes of urbanization and industrialization the ukc is a typical example for many basins worldwide becoming exposed to water stress yet due to very high population growth and establishing raipur as capital of the new state chhattisgarh the dynamics of these processes are comparably high therefore ukc is a typical example with a drastic magnitude of dynamics which is visualizing the typical situation like under a burning glass a further typical characteristic of ukc representing many basins especially in developing countries is the contrast between an urgent need for action in terms of water management strategies infrastructure and the non availability of sufficient data on water use as well as on demand in order to contribute to mitigate this challenging situation we developed an approach which is combining information from different sources at different scales official statistics remote sensing field surveys expert knowledge on i extension of irrigated areas ii intensification of irrigation iii water source used canal versus groundwater and iv water applied referring to seasons and crops the approach enabled to detect important trends with respect to dynamic development of irrigated areas and water sources used areas irrigated with canal water increased between 1991 and 2011 from 35 2 up to 49 7 of the total size of the ukc accordingly the number of villages access to the canal systems has been increased yet still around 17 2 of villages are not linked to the canal system expansion of groundwater irrigated areas was even higher with an increase from 7 9 72 villages utilizing gwi in 1991 to 29 8 252 villages utilizing gwi in 2011 which was strongly driven by groundwater based irrigation in the non monsoon season as a consequence of the pressure on food production for the growing population and eased by availability of pumping facilities and subsidies on electricity in spatial dimension groundwater irrigation is expanding mainly in the southern part of the ukc dhamtari kurud dhamdha and gurur blocks and there especially in the vicinity of the kharun rivers as these sites provide rather easily accessible groundwater aquifers sites being prone to deplete aquifers hotspots were delineated by overlaying areas with a rather high share of groundwater based irrigation and missing canal irrigation and in turn missing groundwater recharge from losses in the canal system conveying water imported from outside the ukc in order to make best use of the existing water infrastructure described by the size of irrigated areas and their dynamics by our approach and to cope with potentially disadvantageous consequences of the above mentioned trends refined water management concepts consisting of interventions in terms of advanced strategies and further developing and or re arranging of infrastructure are required yet as a prerequisite for working out these concepts a substantial improvement of the data situation is necessary purposeful intensification of the groundwater monitoring systems and application of groundwater models are the major tools for providing this additional information the findings of our study can be utilized for conclusions towards facilitating to conceive and apply these tools hotspot areas delineated in our analyses can support to target the intensification of groundwater monitoring systems these sites are at risk towards over exploitation of groundwater resources and therefore require enhancement of groundwater data availability dynamics of irrigated areas in terms of size irrigation intensity and source of irrigation water provided by our study deliver useful information for estimating the percolation and in turn the groundwater recharge which is a key input into groundwater modeling groundwater modeling is needed to extrapolate the trend in groundwater levels under the influence of scenarios on future development of irrigation and in order to conceive strategies to counterbalance over exploitation knowledge on the recharge from irrigated areas and its dependency from irrigation infrastructure and strategies is not only important due to the magnitude of that component but also because of the fact that percolation from irrigated areas can be influenced by water management interventions for example raising irrigation efficiency supporting changes in cropping pattern what is hardly possible with recharge from rainfall results to be achieved by intensified monitoring and groundwater modeling facilitated by findings from our study as argued for in the above paragraphs will have the potential to advance water management towards more sustainable strategies of water use yet the results of our study enable already to suggest following conclusions on water management strategies future strategies need to consider the inter relationships between groundwater and canal based irrigation irrigation water in the canal system is released from reservoirs outside the ukc and therefore losses in the canal system are an additional recharge to groundwater in the 1990s this additional recharge via irrigation water losses from outside as an input into the groundwater system in the ukc and withdrawals from the groundwater in the ukc for irrigation as an output from ukc s groundwater system were balanced strong expansion and intensification of groundwater based irrigation compared to the increase in canal based irrigation is resulting in an unbalanced situation in the sense that output from the aquifers via pumping is exceeding recharge from losses in imported canal water which in tendency and especially in the above mentioned hotspot areas lead to aquifer depletion as a consequence upgrading of the canal system in areas not yet linked as identified and localized in our study could be considered taking eventual obstacles topography into account furthermore strategies towards higher efficiency and productivity in irrigation water use should be considered including improved irrigation schedules advanced handling of irrigation water application support to farmers in terms of advice and cooperation incentives for water saving tackling the input side of the groundwater system in the ukc it could be considered to strengthen decentral storage options in the southern part of the ukc for enhancing groundwater recharge along the kharun river in order to counterbalance the withdrawals in these areas most intensively used for groundwater based irrigation there has been no such detailed research performed on the changes in irrigated areas based on the sources canal and groundwater in ukc which is one of the most important economically sound and highly populated catchments of chhattisgarh state given the high importance and urgent need for such analyses in the study area the results of this research in a highly valuable way can facilitate the introduction of best water and land use management practices in the ukc based on the findings from intensified monitoring and groundwater modeling as suggested above these interventions could be a component of integrated concepts to be embedded in the socio economic and institutional context yet as a first step in adaptive water management the above mentioned interventions could be conceived and considered for stepwise implementation acknowledgements the

11593,in many countries of the mediterranean region characterized by frequent drought periods agricultural production often occurs under water deficiency or conditions that cause the depletion of the existing water resources in these areas the reuse of reclaimed wastewater for crop irrigation could contribute to mitigate decrease water shortage support the agriculture sector and protect groundwater resources in 1 5 year field experiments in southern italy apulia region the effects of irrigation with treated agro industrial wastewater on soil properties crops yield and qualitative traits of crop products including their microbiological safety were assessed groundwater gw secondary treated wastewater sw and tertiary treated wastewater tw from an innovative on demand uv disinfection system were used to irrigate tomato and broccoli cultivated in succession the three irrigation water sources and the corresponding irrigated soils plants and crop products were analyzed for the main physico chemical characteristics quali quantitative parameters and fecal indicators sw and tw showed higher values of the main physico chemical parameters than gw sw irrigated soil resulted in a significant increase of nh4 n na sar ec below the threshold value beyond which a soil is defined as saline during the first tomato crop cycle and of ph during the broccoli growing season irrigation with treated wastewater did not significantly affect the marketable yield nor the qualitative traits of tomato and broccoli crops except for the na and no3 content below the threshold levels defined by the european guidelines for vegetables high levels of e coli above the italian limit for reuse fecal coliforms and fecal enterococci up to 104 cfu 100ml 1 were observed in the sw and when chlorination was not done in the tw nevertheless e coli was not isolated from any sample of soil plant and crop product probably due to its rapid die off moreover low concentrations of fecal coliforms and total heterotrophic count were found in plant and crop product the drip irrigation system used which avoided the close contact between water and plant may have contributed to this under the conditions applied in this study the reuse of treated agro industrial wastewater for irrigation can be considered an effective way to cope with agricultural water shortage in the mediterranean area keywords agro industrial wastewater wastewater reclamation wastewater reuse soil contamination crop yield quality 1 introduction a number of mediterranean countries suffer from water scarcity which has become severe in recent years due to global climate change causing frequent and long lasting periods of drought particularly during the summer these areas experience severe water supply and demand imbalances in the last decades many italian regions have faced the negative impact of drought and the resource scarcity has mostly penalized agricultural activities which uses more than 50 of the total available water while other high priority demands such as those from civil and industrial sectors are satisfied coppola et al 2004 particularly in apulia region south eastern italy water shortage has a serious impact on the local economy mostly based on agriculture moreover the agricultural coastal areas of apulia region suffer from relevant phenomena of seawater intrusion into the water table due to the excessive and often uncontrolled groundwater withdrawals for irrigation libutti and monteleone 2012 for these reasons alternative water sources are needed treated municipal wastewater is the most readily available source of water to meet the increasing demand for crop irrigation indeed in recent years wastewater recycling in agriculture has gained importance as component of agricultural water supply in several water scarce countries qadir et al 2007 pedrero et al 2010 wastewater reuse not only provides significant amount of irrigation water but also contributes to conserve potable resources and reduces the environmental impact related to the effluents discharge into water bodies aiello et al 2007 pedrero et al 2010 agrafioti and diamadopoulos 2012 furthermore soil application of treated wastewater also constitutes a reliable source of nutrients especially nitrogen phosphorus and potassium and organic matter useful for maintaining the fertility and the productivity of the soil meli et al 2002 rusan et al 2007 treated wastewater use for crop irrigation can improve growth and yield of herbaceous species kiziloglu et al 2008 bedbabis et al 2010 and can also enhance the economic benefits for farmers due to reduced need for fertilizer bedbabis et al 2010 paranychianakis et al 2006 however the chemical composition of wastewater has to be monitored to avoid imbalance in nutrient supply which may result in excessive vegetative growth uneven fruit maturity reduced quality and quantity of yields pedrero et al 2010 treated wastewater should be used for irrigation under controlled conditions also to minimize hazards to agricultural products soil and groundwater from toxic and pathogenic contaminants aiello et al 2007 qadir et al 2007 wastewater may contain a variety of pollutants such as salts heavy metals organic compounds enteric bacteria and viruses an excessive accumulation of trace metals such as cd cu fe mn pb and zn in soils through irrigation creates problems for agricultural production singh et al 2004 and leads to metal uptake by crops so affecting food quality and safety khan et al 2008 one of the crucial issues in the reuse of treated wastewater for crop irrigation is the residual presence of pathogenic microorganism rubino and lonigro 2008 petterson et al 2011 which represents a potential health risk to consumers when they enter in the food chain toze 2006 in italy there are strict regulations for reclaimed wastewater reuse decree no 152 2006 ministry for environment especially for levels of some chemical compounds and for microbial parameters with regard to microbiological contamination levels the corresponding guidelines allow unrestricted crop irrigation with a bacteriological effluent quality characterized by less than 10 cfu 100ml 1 of e coli in 80 of samples several experimental evidences underline the effect on soil and yield of reclaimed urban wastewater application for vegetable and fruit crops irrigation in the mediterranean area lonigro et al 2007 palese et al 2009 disciglio et al 2014 lonigro et al 2015 gatta et al 2016 our research activity focuses instead on treated agro industrial wastewater reuse in agriculture the reused agro industrial wastewater was originated by an agricultural and food manufacturing company which produces and processes vegetables in apulia region southern italy studies about the reuse of wastewater of agro industrial origin for crop irrigation have been little evaluated and are poorly documented in literature recovery of this type of wastewater is instead of particular relevance in the apulia region where the economic system is strongly based on irrigated agriculture and characterized by a widespread presence of agro food industries whose activity annually releases large quantities of wastewater usually discharged into torrents or rivers moreover apulia is one of the european regions most heavily affected by water shortage xiloyannis et al 2002 in this contest a careful management of agro industrial wastewater for agricultural purposes represents a useful alternative to conventional water resources allows to support irrigated agriculture reduces costs and environmental impact of wastewater disposal these advantages become even more useful when vegetable processing companies produce wastewater and grow the crops at the same site as in the case study reported in this work more specifically the present paper reports the results of a 1 5 year research on irrigating vegetable crops with this type of water source in southern italy two treatment schemes were applied to wastewater and the treated effluents were used for the irrigation of a test field where processing tomato and broccoli crops were cultivated in close succession with reference to the experimental trial described here others papers reporting the results of the first tomato crop cycle have been already published disciglio et al 2015 gatta et al 2015a b unlike all these cited studies which had the objectives to evaluate the effects of secondary treated agro industrial wastewater on different soil and tomato crop yield characteristics the present paper deals with the irrigation use of an additional treated wastewater type such as the tertiary treated wastewater and a longer experimental period such as the succession of three cropping cycles in order to assess i the impact of treated wastewater on the main chemical properties of irrigated soil ii the effects of treated wastewater on quantitative and qualitative aspects of crops yield iii the risk of microbiological contamination of irrigated soil and the pathogen health risk of crop products 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental site the study was carried out in open field from april 2012 to september 2013 in the north west part of the apulia region southern italy at stornarella 41 15 n 15 44 e altitude 154m a s l in the foggia district the area is characterized by a mediterranean climate with air temperatures that drops below 0 in winter and exceed peaks of 40 c in summer the long term average annual rainfall is 590mm with precipitations unevenly distributed throughout the year and predominantly concentrated in the period from october to april caliandro et al 2005 during the experimental period the daily meteorological parameters such as maximum and minimum air temperature tmax tmin maximum and minimum air relative humidity rhmax rhmin wind speed ws and total precipitation p were recorded these were measured by a weather station placed close to the experimental field and recorded using a data logger campbell scientific usa the study area is characterized by a widespread presence of agro food industries specialized in vegetables processing the experimental site was located within the fiordelisi agricultural and food manufacturing company fiordelisi s activity includes growing processing packaging and marketing of preserved ready to eat vegetables such as tomato eggplant zucchini and pepper this activity involves the production of large quantities of wastewater that undergoes a purification process before being discharged according to local regulations to this purpose the fiordelisi company is equipped with a wastewater treatment plant wwtp the wwtp was upgraded in order to produce effluents suitable for reuse thus supplying the two types of treated wastewater used for crops irrigation during the experimental period one produced by the conventional treatment system and the other by the upgraded configuration the reclaimed water was then used within a closed circle system where the wastewater produced as a by product from vegetables processing becomes a water resource for vegetable crops irrigation according to the criteria of recycling treated wastewater as a component of agricultural water supply in water scarce environmental conditions in the years 2012 and 2013 the fiordelisi company produced about 100 000m3y 1 of wastewater mainly composed of washing and processing water vegetables cooking steaming bottles washing etc water from cleaning floors and equipment and toilet water 5 10 the wastewater was purified in the wwtp fig 1 based on the following processes i primary treatments such as screening oil removal equalization and ph adjustment ii secondary treatments such as activated sludge process anoxic plus aerobic phases and chemically assisted secondary sedimentation iii tertiary treatments such as chlorination applied only during the period 01 october 2012 31 march 2013 sand filtration membrane ultrafiltration by 8 modules hyflux kristal 600et with a nominal surface of 60m2 and a nominal pore size of 0 05μm and uv radiation by 6 mercury vapor lamps 200w each the effluent of the secondary sedimentation is called secondary treated wastewater sw whereas the uv outlet is called tertiary treated wastewater tw sw and membrane filtered effluent were conveyed to the respective 10m3 storage tanks in order to maximize its effectiveness and save on energy costs the uv disinfection system was operated in line with irrigation thus the tw was disinfected just before being distributed to the plants on demand disinfection fig 1 periodical backwashing of the sand filter 15min duration every 8h of operation and the ultrafiltration membranes 30s duration every 45min of operation was performed with the membrane permeate membranes were also cleaned chemically with diluted soda and sodium hypochlorite approximately every 10days according to the procedures suggested by the manufacturer membrane ultrafiltration was monitored for the operating pressure and the permeate flux the experiments were carried out in a clay loam soil usda classification with a field capacity 0 03mpa of 30 5 dry weight dw a wilting point 1 5mpa of 15 9 dw and a bulk density of 1 4mgm 3 the main physico chemical properties of the 0 0 60m soil layer of the experimental field as characterized

experimental period three vegetable crops were grown in close succession processing tomato broccoli and processing tomato tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill cultivar manyla was transplanted on april 12 2012 as to the first crop cycle broccoli brassica oleracea l var italica ibrid partenon f1 was transplanted on october 12 2012 tomato cultivar manyla was transplanted on april 5 2013 as the second crop cycle the seedlings were transplanted in double rows 40cm apart spaced at 250cm at a distance of 30cm along each single row realizing a final plant density of 2 7 plants m 2 tomato and broccoli plants were grown under a net house structure which was covered with an anti hail net in particular tomato plants were grown vertically using nylon threads positioned between the plant collar and iron wires arranged longitudinally in the direction of the plant rows and fixed to the upper part of the net house at 2 5m from the ground during each growing season the plants were irrigated whenever the soil water deficit in the effective root zone 0 50cm in depth was 40 of the total available soil water allen et al 1998 this irrigation threshold was assessed through a continuous monitoring of the volumetric soil water content using probes operating in the frequency domain reflectometry and installed in each plot prior to crops transplanting at 5 15 25 35 and 45cm soil depth at each irrigation the soil water content was increased to field capacity with a water volume varying from 100 to 400m3 ha 1 depending on the crop growth stage the seasonal irrigation volumes were 4957m3 ha 1 for tomato crop in 2012 922m3 ha 1 for broccoli crop in 2012 2013 and 4070m3 ha 1 for tomato crop in 2013 a drip irrigation method was used for the three crops this compriseda single drip line with drippers at 2l h 1 flow rate spaced every 40cm and placed in the middle of each couple of plant rows during the two tomato crop cycles the drip lines were placed under a black plastic mulching film all agricultural management practices including fertilization weed and pest control applied to the three crops were performed according to the agronomic techniques commonly adopted by local farmers before transplanting the soil was subsoiled to a depth of 45cm and its surface was milled a pre transplanting fertilization was then applied by distributing 35kgha 1 n and 70kgha 1 p2o5 before the two tomato cropping cycles started and 21kgha 1 n and 35kgha 1 p2o5 before the broccoli cropping cycle started throughout each of the two tomato crop cycles 75kgha 1 n and 100kgha 1 p2o5 were added through fertirrigation during the broccoli crop cycle a top dressing fertilization was applied to the soil by distributing 63kgha 1 n 2 3 experimental layout during the first tomato crop cycle two irrigation treatments were applied irrigation with gw and irrigation with sw during the broccoli and the second tomato crop cycles a third treatment was also considered irrigation with tw the tertiary treatment of wastewater produced by fiordelisi company was introduced in september 2012 just before the start of the broccoli crop cycle to produce effluents with lower suspended solids and microbiological pollution gw represents the irrigation source normally used by local farmers for crop irrigation it was withdrawn from a phreatic well located near the experimental field and stored in a 10m3 tank before being used for tomato and broccoli irrigation fig 1 gw sw and tw were directly pumped from their storage tanks to the drip irrigation system used for plants watering fig 2 as previously mentioned tw was uv disinfected in line with the distribution the experimental field was arranged according to a complete randomized block design with the irrigation treatments gw sw and tw each one replicated three times for a total of 6 plots for the first tomato crop 2 irrigation treatments 3 replicates and 9 plots for the broccoli and the second tomato crops 3 irrigation treatments 3

sampling was performed monthly from october 2012 to september 2013 irrigation water samples gw sw and tw were collected monthly over the whole irrigation period of each crop after tank storage and immediately before their inlet in the irrigation system fig 2 at each sampling date three samples of each water type were collected using sterile 1000 ml glass bottles and transported to the laboratory in refrigerated bags they were then kept in a refrigerator at 4 c and examined within 24h of collection soil samples were collected in triplicate from the gw sw and tw irrigated plots before each crop transplantation and at monthly intervals during each crop cycle all soil samples were taken from a 0 30cm soil layer high density root zone from under the drippers by using a soil auger they were air dried and passed through a 2mm sieve before the laboratory analysis during each growing season samples of tomato and broccoli plants were collected at the same time of soil sampling in triplicates from each experimental plot samples of tomato fruits and broccoli heads were collected at each harvesting date from the sampling area of 20m2 of each experimental plot plants tomato fruits and broccoli heads were immediately transported to the laboratory in refrigerated bags and analyzed within few hours from the sampling 2 5 water soil plant and crops product analysis all

microbiological analysis of the soil plant and product samples from each experimental treatment included the determination of the parameters showed in table 1 these analyses were conducted by the spread plate method as follows 25 0g of each sample was weighed and added to 225 0ml buffered peptone water homogenized in a stomacher for 180s then serial 10 fold dilutions in buffered peptone water were spread onto agar plates containing tbx for e coli c ec agar for fecal coliforms and tryptic soy agar for total heterotrophic count the plates were incubated under different incubation temperatures and times as follows 37 c for e coli 24h 44 c for fecal coliforms 48h and 22 c for total heterotrophic count 72h at each harvesting date tomato fruits and broccoli heads from each gw sw and tw irrigated plot were analyzed for quantitative traits all the marketable and discarded tomato fruits and broccoli heads were counted and weighed respectively to estimate the yield parameters table 1 at the same time a sample of 10 tomato fruits and a sample of 10 broccoli heads from each plot were transported to the laboratory and immediately analyzed for qualitative traits table 1 the color parameters of tomato fruits were measured using a cm 700d spectrophotometer minolta camera co ltd osaka japan as the cielab coordinates i e l a b on four randomly selected areas of the fruit surface here only the a b ratio 2 2 a red green chromaticity negative values indicate green while positive values indicate red b yellow blu chromaticity negative values indicate blue while positive values indicate yellow so the higher the a b ratio the higher the red color of tomato fruit is reported which represents an index that describes well the color changes of tomato fruit francis and clydesdale 1975 favati et al 2009 the cation and the anion contents of both tomato fruits and broccoli heads were determined by ion exchange chromatography dionex ics 1100 dionex corporation sunnyvale ca usa 2 6 statistical analysis the data related to the physico chemical characteristics of the two irrigation waters and the corresponding irrigated soils the quantitative and qualitative parameters of the crop products the microbiological properties of the irrigation waters soils plants and crop products collected during the first tomato crop cycle were analyzed by unpaired t tests the same data detected on the three irrigation water sources and the corresponding irrigated soils plants and crop products during the broccoli and the second tomato crop cycles were statistically processed by analysis of variance anova when significant effects were detected p 0 05 mean multiple comparisons were performed according to tukey test two different statistical tests were applied because the considered experimental factor irrigation water had two levels irrigation water type gw and sw during the first tomato cropping cycle and three levels irrigation water type gw sw and tw during the following broccoli and tomato cropping cycles therefore for each experimental data two and three mean values were statistically discriminated by t test and tukey test in the first and second case respectively before being processed all the microbiological data were logarithmically transformed log10 x 1 when in water soil plant and crop product microbial indicators were not detected the corresponding levels were set equal to zero the addition of the unit value to x was necessary in order to prevent an impossible solution in case of x 0 all the statistical analyses were performed using the jmp software package version 8 1 jmp 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatic conditions the average monthly values of the meteorological parameters recorded during the experimental period are reported in table 2 during the tomato 2012 and tomato 2013 growing seasons mean values of air temperature were similar rainfall was higher in 2013 than in 2012 with 43 of total precipitation occurred in august in 2012 62 of total precipitation was recorded in the first part of cultivation cycle in april during the broccoli 2012 2013 growing season rainfall was characterized by an almost regular distribution over the months with a peak in november when 36 of total precipitation occurred 3 2 physico chemical properties of water from wastewater treatment plant the average values of the main physico chemical parameters measured in rw sw and tw from wwtp are reported in table 3 where also the italian standards for reuse in irrigation of reclaimed wastewater are showed rw had low ph high salinity and a considerable presence of tss organic substances as demonstrated by the high cod value and surfactants the activated sludge process and the following secondary settling effectively removed most suspended solids and organic substances as well as nitrogen and phosphorus with average removal percentages of 89 96 86 94 and respectively as previously reported the tertiary treatment of wastewater was introduced in september 2012 before broccoli crop cycle started the main objective was to remove the residual suspended solids and the microbiological pollution which represented the main non compliances for the sw with respect to the standards for reuse in agriculture table 3 the influent pressure to the sand filter was maintained between 1 5 and 2 0bar and the residual pressure in the influent to the membranes was constantly at 0 5 0 6bar the average flow produced was 12m3 h 1 corresponding to a specific flux of the membranes of 25lm 2 h 1 during the first 6 months october 2012 march 2013 of tertiary treatment operation in correspondence of broccoli cropping cycle the sand filtration unit was preceded by a chlorination step this removed completely the monitoring indicator e coli whose concentration was always below 10 cfu 100ml 1 in both the influent to the sand filtration unit and in the tw from march 2013 the chlorination step was stopped this allowed to evaluate the effect of the ultrafiltration and uv radiation processes on e coli removal fig 3 a residual presence of suspended solids and e coli was observed in the membrane permeate indicating a possible leakage for one or more modules membrane integrity was then checked through a pressure decay test astm 2003 which indicated the presence of leakages in 6 modules out of 8 nevertheless the concentration of suspended solids in the membrane permeate was on average within the limit for reuse 10mgl 1 before uv disinfection which was performed on line with the irrigation the tw was stored in the 10m3 tank fig 1 for a period between 1 and 7days depending on the irrigation needs in the storage tank the concentration of suspended solids tended to increase during this time possibly due to bacterial re growth and reached an average value of 17 5 9 4mgl 1 fig 3 this phenomenon may have limited the effectiveness of the uv disinfection which is known to decrease with increasing turbidity indeed the removal of the fecal indicator e coli after the uv radiation varied between 0 5 and 3 log units fig 3 3 3 physico chemical properties of irrigation water table 4 shows the physico chemical properties of gw sw and tw measured during tomato 2012 broccoli 2012 2013 and tomato 2013 growing seasons the characteristics of the three sources of irrigation water resulted significantly different during each crop cycle on the contrary for each type of irrigation water very low differences were observed among the crop cycles the three water sources were alkaline with a significantly higher ph for gw than sw and tw only during the broccoli 2012 2013 growing season compared with gw sw and tw were always characterized by higher values of nh4 n and no2 n p k ca and mg the presence of these chemical components in treated wastewater is very interesting from an agronomic point of view since they represent important nutrients for improving soil fertility plant growth and crop yield rodriguez liébana et al 2014 with respect to gw sw and tw had also a higher content of organic matter as indicated by bod5 and cod values and significantly higher values of na ec and sar according to ayers and westcot 1985 as regards the ec and na values observed in the two treated wastewaters their reuse for irrigation can be considered from slightly to moderately restricted moreover if the values of sar are related to the values of ec it follow that their application would not cause a reduction of the infiltration rate into the soil also hardness and tss were significantly higher in the two treated wastewaters than in gw during the whole experimental period gw had significantly higher no3 n concentration 29 06 23 19 and 22 98mgl 1 during the three crop cycles respectively than the other two water sources the high concentration of no3 n in gw is due to the nitrate contamination of the aquifer since in the study area intensive agricultural activity has led to extensive and frequently excessive nitrogen fertilizer applications to the crops the resulting nitrogen surplus in the soil is then particularly exposed to the leaching risk thus increasing the problem of groundwater nitrate pollution libutti and monteleone 2017 this elevated no3 n content in gw represents an important source of nutrient for the plants but unfortunately it is not always taken into account by farmers in the crop fertilization planning as regards the other parameters so4 2 co3 2 and hco3 they had always similar levels in the three irrigation water sources the values for the main physico chemical water properties for gw sw and tw met the italian standards for treated wastewater reuse legislative decree no 152 2006 except for the tss and bod5 for sw and tw slightly exceeding the limit set by the legislation 10mgl 1 and 20mg o2 l 1 respectively while a non compliance for the parameter tss is common for a secondary settled effluent in the case of tw this was due to two factors specific of this case study i e the leakage of ultrafiltration membranes and the bacterial re growth in the storage tank nevertheless for both sw and tw the concentration of tss was far below the limit of 50mgl 1 established to avoid clogging problems in drip irrigation systems ayers and westcot 1985 concerning the bod5 the observed values of this parameter may not be considered a limiting factor for treated wastewater reuse since they indicate that both sw and tw were a source of organic matter for the irrigated soil this aspect has been also highlighted by others studies which proposed to skip the biological processes in the reclamation process in order to save the agronomic potential of organic matter and nutrients contained in the urban wastewater lopez et al 2006 lonigro et al 2007 palese et al 2009 3 4 chemical properties of soil the main chemical properties of the 0 30cm soil layer in gw sw and tw irrigated plots over the tomato 2012 broccoli 2012 2013 and tomato 2013 growing seasons are reported in table 5 significant differences between gw and sw irrigated plots were observed in some soil chemical properties during the tomato 2012 growing season the use of sw for crop irrigation resulted in a significant increase of nh4 n na and consequently of ec and sar of the soil these results are consistent with the chemical properties of the irrigation water indeed the higher nh4 n concentration in sw than in gw table 4 resulted in a higher nh4 n concentration in the corresponding irrigated plots even though part of the nh4 n supplied through irrigation water was readily available for plants growth most of it was adsorbed to the negative charged clay particle surface of sw irrigated soil duan et al 2010 similarly the higher concentration of na in sw if compared with gw resulted in a higher na concentration in the corresponding irrigated plots this result is in line with previous studies najafi and nasr 2009 mojiri 2011 because of the higher na concentration in sw than in gw also the ec of the soil in sw irrigated plots was much higher twice as big than the values observed in gw irrigated plots and in sw irrigated plots before the experimental period started 0 45 and 0 50dsm 1 respectively rusan et al 2007 reported similar results khai et al 2008 and mojiri 2011 stated that the increase of ec in soil irrigated with wastewater was mainly due to the original higher concentration of cations such as na and k nevertheless ec values observed in sw soil remained below the indicative threshold value 4 00dsm 1 beyond which a soil is defined as saline qadir et al 2000 also as regards the sar of the soil the significant difference between sw and gw plots was probably due to na accumulation in the root zone when sar is in the range of 12 15 damages to the physical characteristics of the soil may occur munshower 1994 however the calculated sar value was clearly below the limit of 15 above which a soil can be considered sodic us salinity laboratory staff 1954 although no3 n concentration was higher in gw than in sw no significant differences between gw and sw plots were observed in terms of no3 n content in the 0 30cm soil this suggest that the no3 n contained in gw was in part utilized by the crop and the possible no3 n in excess of plants requirements so not adsorbed by tomato plants was likely moved below the0 30cmsoil layer due to its high mobility in the soil yuan et al 2000 shamrukh et al 2001 over the broccoli growing season 2012 2013 significantly higher ph value was measured in sw than tw irrigated plots table 5 in comparison with tw soil the ph of sw soil raised of 0 2 units to an average value of 8 48 this was likely due to the higher accumulation although not significantly so of basic cations particularly ca2 and mg2 from irrigation water in sw than tw irrigated plots table 4 increase of soil ph by approximately 0 8 units under irrigation with treated wastewater has been reported by tarchouna et al 2000 previously also mancino and pepper 1992 found that irrigation with treated wastewater raised the soil ph by 0 1 0 2 units when compared with irrigation with drinking water these authors attributed such a ph rise to the high content of basic cations of the wastewater which raised the alkaline reserve of the soil particularly the average values for ca2 and mg2 in the soil were significantly higher in sw and tw than in gw irrigated plots this result was consistent with the higher ca2 and mg2 concentration of sw and tw than gw table 4 and likely indicated that the treated wastewater input for these chemical species was higher than the broccoli plants uptake as observed during the previous tomato cycle also over the broccoli growing season no differences were found in no3 n concentration of sw and tw irrigated soils with respect to gw soil no3 n amount in the 0 30cm soil layer was similar among the three irrigation water sources and lower than the previous crop cycle this result can be explained considering that during the broccoli cycle the high rainfall associated with the limited rate of no3 n uptake by the plants contributed to the removal of the no3 n supplied by irrigation water and not utilized by the crop from the upper to the deeper soil layers by drainage water a study of arregui and quemada 2006 showed that in mediterranean climate nitrogen leaching easily occurs in the autumn winter season when crop nitrogen demand is low precipitation exceeds crop evapotranspiration and considerable drainage took place along the soil profile differently from the previous tomato cycle there were no significant effects on soil salinity due to use of treated wastewater for broccoli irrigation particularly the ec values measured on sw and tw irrigated soils were very low 0 28 and 0 27dsm 1 respectively despite the fact that ec values and na concentrations in sw and tw were significantly higher than in gw for the three types of irrigation water ec in the soil remarkably decreased not only with respect to the previous crop cycle but also with respect to the value of ec measured before the start of the experimental period 0 49dsm 1 as well as for no3 this was due to the high rainfall occurred during the broccoli cycle libutti and monteleone 2012 monteleone and libutti 2012 over the tomato growing season 2013 there were no significant effects of the irrigation with treated wastewater neither sw or tw on any of the measured chemical parameters of the soil table 5 the data observed in the 0 30cm soil showed similar soil fertility levels for the three irrigation water sources although sw and tw had always higher bod5 and cod values than gw no significant differences were observed among the average values of om in gw sw and tw irrigated soils over the three growing seasons it is possible that a rapid mineralization of the organic material supplied through the irrigation with treated wastewater occurred gloaguen et al 2007 observed a decrease of organic carbon in the soil after the irrigation with treated wastewater and hypothesized that this was related to an increase of the soil microbiological activity due to the labile carbon supplied by wastewater similarly for the three crops there were no significant differences among the average concentrations of total n and p2o5 in gw sw and tw irrigated soils as observed in the studies of midrar et al 2004 and heidarpour et al 2007 3 5 microbiological properties of water soil plant and crops product the microbiological properties of the three irrigation water sources gw sw and tw divided by growing seasons are reported in table 6 gw had a content of e coli below the current italian threshold of 10 cfu 100ml 1 for wastewater reuse legislative decree no 152 2006 during the tomato 2012 growing season and was free of this fecal indicator during the broccoli 2012 2013 and tomato 2013 growing seasons fecal coliforms and fecal enterococci were always detected in gw over the three cropping seasons but at considerably lower concentration than those observed for the two treated wastewaters with respect to gw and tw sw had always a significantly higher concentration of e coli well above the local limit for reuse fecal coliforms and fecal enterococci tw had a very low residual fecal contamination during the broccoli 2012 2013 growing season with the total absence of e coli and average levels of 0 20 log cfu 100ml 1 and 0 42 log cfu 100ml 1 for fecal coliforms and fecal enterococci respectively a higher average concentration of e coli 2 08 log cfu 100ml 1 fecal coliforms and fecal enterococci 2 20 log cfu 100ml 1 and 1 82 log cfu 100ml 1 respectively were observed in tw during the tomato 2013 growing season this was due to the membrane failure and to a minor extent to the bacterial re growth occurred in tw storage tank because of these two factors the turbidity of the treated wastewater so increased to a level that hampered the uv disinfection efficiency fig 3 for the three irrigation water types salmonella spp was never isolated in any of the analyzed samples as required by the above cited legislation regarding the microbiological properties of the soil table 6 e coli was never isolated in any of the gw sw and tw soil samples over the three crop cycles despite the presence of e coli in gw during the tomato 2012 growing season in sw during the entire experimental period and in tw during the tomato 2013 growing season this could be due to the die off of this indicator as reported by several other studies lang et al 2007 van elsas et al 2011 however it has to be stated that it is not possible to exclude the presence of e coli in the analyzed soil samples since the sensitivity of the applied method is 100cfug 1 samarajeewa et al 2010 and a loss of cultivability of e coli may also have led to underestimation fecal coliforms were isolated in all soil samples but at levels not significantly different among the three irrigation water treatments particularly in gw irrigated soils a high concentration of fecal coliforms was observed over the three growing seasons if compared with the low presence of these indicators in the corresponding irrigation water similar result was obtained in tw irrigated soil during the broccoli 2012 2013 growing season this suggests that the presence of fecal coliforms in the soil may be also caused by sources of contamination different from the irrigation water such as roaming animals birds and runoff mawdsley et al 1995 venglovsky et al 2006 high level of total heterotrophic count were observed in all soil samples these resulted not significantly different among the three irrigation water treatments during the two tomato growing seasons on the contrary during the broccoli 2012 2013 growing season significantly higher level of total heterotrophic count were observed in gw than in tw irrigated soil concerning the microbiological analysis of plant and product of the crops e coli was not isolated in any of the analyzed samples overall fecal coliforms were found to be lower on the crop products than on the plant and moreover their values were not influenced by the water used for irrigation also the total heterotrophic count that accounts for the autochthonous microorganism of soil and the possible input of microorganisms from the irrigation water was not influenced by the water type except for the broccoli plants for which the total heterotrophic count resulted higher on sw than on tw irrigated plants the low levels of microbial indicators on plants and crop products can be explained by a substantial lack of contact between irrigation water soil plants and edible parts of the plant these results are in agreement with the findings of a previous study cirelli et al 2012 that reports the contamination of tomato and eggplant fruits by fecal bacteria only in case of direct contact with the soil irrigated with treated municipal wastewater as already reported for the soil contamination also the presence of fecal coliforms on plant and product irrigated with gw during the tomato 2012 growing season was likely due to other sources of contamination 3 6 quantitative and qualitative properties of crops product data reported in table 7 show the quantitative traits of crop products observed over the three considered growing seasons during the tomato 2012 growing seasons marketable yield my was higher although not significantly so for gw than sw as already reported by gatta et al 2015a this appears to be mainly due to the higher nonmarketable yield nmy for sw with respect to gw during the broccoli 2012 2013 growing season significantly lower values of my and significantly higher values of nmy were observed for sw and tw than gw treatment table 7 there are very few researches in literature about the use of reclaimed wastewater for broccoli crop irrigation and they focus on the accumulation of macro and micro nutrients in plant and soil kalavrouziotis et al 2008a 2008b 2009 no literature data about the productive response of broccoli crop to irrigation with treated wastewater are available however the broccoli yield value observed in the present experimental trial is roughly in agreement with the data obtained by candido et al 2001 in a field trial carried out with a conventional irrigation water source in an agricultural area of southern italy similar to that of the present study and aimed to compare different irrigation methods in order to increase the efficiency of irrigation water as during the tomato 2012 and 2013 growing season a higher my for gw with respect to sw and tw treatments was detected although the differences were not statistically significant the yields of tomato fruit observed in both the two growing seasons are roughly in agreement with the results obtained by aiello et al 2007 in an experimental trial carried out in southern italy they reported a higher my from the tomato missouri genotype irrigated with freshwater than the same genotype irrigated with treated wastewater compared to the yields observed for the missouri genotype in the above mentioned study the my obtained in the present study for the manila variety were lower this might be due to several factors such as the differences between the genetic constitution of the two cultivars the characteristics of the treated wastewater or also the pedo environmental conditions of the cultivation areas gatta et al 2015a the qualitative traits of crop products are showed in table 8 significant differences between the two irrigation water sources gw and sw were observed for the ph of fruits during the tomato 2012 growing season in particular a higher ph value in gw than sw treatment was detected ph is a very important parameter for the evaluation of tomato fruits quality since it influences the processing thermal condition required to control microbial spoilage and enzyme inactivation and obtain safe products garcia and barret 2006 ph values in this study were within the same range 4 32 4 56 obtained by madrid et al 2009 this ph range is typical of tomato fruits hong et al 2000 and shows their slightly acid nature the irrigation water had no effect on titrable acidity ta of tomato fruits data here presented are very close to the mean acidity of processing tomatoes that is generally of about 0 35 garcia and barret 2006 also soluble solids content of the flesh ssc values showed no significant difference between the two irrigation water sources nevertheless a slightly higher ssc was observed in gw 5 73 brix than sw 5 53 brix madrid et al 2009 and favati et al 2009 reported lower ssc values than those observed in the present study these differences could be due to several factors among which the tomato genotype used sgherri et al 2007 2008 the environmental drought mahajan and singh 2006 soraya et al 2001 and the climatic conditions such as temperature co2 concentration and light however high ssc improves the efficiency of tomato fruits processing johnstone et al 2005 and has direct implication for the tomato canning industry richardson and hobson 2006 because of the minor quantity of energy necessary to evaporate water from the fruits when producing tomato paste or concentrated juice favati et al 2009 richardson and hobson 2006 higher solid content in fruits is therefore a target characteristic as this would reduce the cost for processing and serves as the basis for fixing the price to be paid to the producer turhan and seniz 2009 as well as for ssc also high dry matter content dm is a desirable characteristic for the canning tomatoes industry since it improves the quality of the processed product de pascale et al 2001 results here presented showed dm values not different between gw and sw 7 44 vs 7 52 and acceptable for industrial processing moreover they are in agreement with the findings of turhan and seniz 2009 which observed dm values ranging from 4 to 7 in a wide field experiment carried out in the mediterranean basin aiming to compare the quality characteristics of 33 tomato genotypes regarding fruits size no relevant effects of the irrigation water source were observed on mean diameter d and color index ci the latter which is commonly used as a quality redness index brightness of red colour of tomatoes was found in the range from 0 97 to 1 14 these data were also in agreement with the a b range from 0 95 to 1 21 observed by batu 2004 on tomato fruits at the red stage of maturity from a greenhouse experiment as regards the anions and cations content of fruits during the tomato 2012 growing season na and no3 concentrations were significantly influenced by the irrigation with treated wastewater na was higher in sw than gw 11 05 vs 9 15mg 100g 1 of fresh matter likely due to the significantly higher na content in sw in comparison with gw table 4 on the contrary no3 content was significantly higher in gw than sw treatment 1 32 vs 0 92mg 100g 1 of fresh matter in agreement with the higher no3 n concentration of gw table 4 however no3 content of tomato fruits were well below the nitrate levels in vegetables as defined by the european guidelines european union regulation n 1258 2011 currently adopted in italy except for ca2 and na contents the observed results are in agreement with other studies guil guerrero and rebolloso fuentes 2009 according to the data of table 8 over the broccoli 2012 2013 growing season most of the qualitative traits of crop yield were not significantly different among the three irrigation water sources although not statistically different dm and d were respectively higher in sw and tw than gw on the contrary for broccoli heads significant differences in na and no3 content were observed na was significantly higher when plants were irrigated with sw and tw than with gw no3 was higher in plants irrigated with gw than in those irrigated with sw and tw these results clearly reflect the different values of na and no3 among the three irrigation water sources table 4 also in this case the no3 content in broccoli heads was below the above mentioned limits for nitrate concentration in vegetables during the tomato 2012 2013 growing season the qualitative traits measured in tomato fruits confirmed the results obtained in the first tomato crop cycle for dm d ci ssc ta and ph there were no significant differences among gw sw and tw water sources all the obtained values were within the typical range for tomato fruits and also in agreement with the results of other studies as already reported with respect to the tomato growing season 2012 as regards the na and ca2 content of the fruits higher values were found in tomato growing season 2013 than in tomato growing season 2012 moreover during the second cycle the irrigation water significantly affected the ca2 content of the fruits which resulted higher for crops irrigated with gw if compared with those irrigated with sw and tw except for ca2 and k contents these results are in agreement with the mineral content of tomato fruits reported by other authors guil guerrero and rebolloso fuentes 2009 4 conclusions this paper presents a 1 5 year field study of reuse of treated agro industrial wastewater secondary treated wastewater after activated sludge process and sedimentation and tertiary treated wastewater after ultrafiltration and uv radiation were used to irrigate two vegetable species in succession processing tomato and broccoli in a closed system where an agri food company cultivated and processed vegetables and had wastewater as by product the findings of the present study indicate that agro industrial effluents have the potential to be recycled for irrigation after a tertiary treatment composed of ultrafiltration and on demand uv disinfection processes the yield of tomato and broccoli crops as well as the most important qualitative parameters of tomato fruits i e dry matter content soluble solid content titratable acidity ph and broccoli heads i e dry matter content diameter were not influenced by the irrigation with treated wastewater the microbiological characteristics of the two treated wastewaters were considerably different from the conventional water source groundwater and also between each other nevertheless the microbiological quality of the tomato fruits and broccoli heads was not affected by the type of irrigation water used the die off of fecal indicators in the soil and the drip irrigation method by reducing the direct contact between the water and the plant limited the possible contamination of the crops products moreover this type of irrigation system reduces the amount of irrigation water that needs to be supplied so avoiding deep water percolation and surface water run off processes so it can be recommended for wastewater reuse in irrigation the knowledge on the reuse of treated agro industrial wastewater in irrigation is still scarce and more studies are needed to evaluate the quality of the treated effluent under different conditions in terms of both industrial processes and wastewater treatments and the long term effects on soil and plants however the findings presented in this paper suggest that this practice is an effective option to have a useful aternative to conventional water resources in areas where intensive agriculture is present and the sustainability of agricultural sector strongly depends on water availability indeed in the specific case reported the agro industrial wastewater reclamation the recovery and the reuse of the resulting treated water allowed to profit of about 10 000m3 ha 1 of water for irrigation of a succession of tomato and broccoli crops in a time period of 1 5 years so decreasing the stress on the conventional water resources in particular within the context of the experimental trial here reported this practice could save about 6000m3 ha 1 of groundwater every year acknowledgments this study was part of the project technology and process innovations for irrigation re use of treated municipal and agro industrial wastewaters in order to achieve sustainable water resources management in te r r a contract no 01 01480 co funded by the italian ministry of universities and research miur within the italian pon

11593,in many countries of the mediterranean region characterized by frequent drought periods agricultural production often occurs under water deficiency or conditions that cause the depletion of the existing water resources in these areas the reuse of reclaimed wastewater for crop irrigation could contribute to mitigate decrease water shortage support the agriculture sector and protect groundwater resources in 1 5 year field experiments in southern italy apulia region the effects of irrigation with treated agro industrial wastewater on soil properties crops yield and qualitative traits of crop products including their microbiological safety were assessed groundwater gw secondary treated wastewater sw and tertiary treated wastewater tw from an innovative on demand uv disinfection system were used to irrigate tomato and broccoli cultivated in succession the three irrigation water sources and the corresponding irrigated soils plants and crop products were analyzed for the main physico chemical characteristics quali quantitative parameters and fecal indicators sw and tw showed higher values of the main physico chemical parameters than gw sw irrigated soil resulted in a significant increase of nh4 n na sar ec below the threshold value beyond which a soil is defined as saline during the first tomato crop cycle and of ph during the broccoli growing season irrigation with treated wastewater did not significantly affect the marketable yield nor the qualitative traits of tomato and broccoli crops except for the na and no3 content below the threshold levels defined by the european guidelines for vegetables high levels of e coli above the italian limit for reuse fecal coliforms and fecal enterococci up to 104 cfu 100ml 1 were observed in the sw and when chlorination was not done in the tw nevertheless e coli was not isolated from any sample of soil plant and crop product probably due to its rapid die off moreover low concentrations of fecal coliforms and total heterotrophic count were found in plant and crop product the drip irrigation system used which avoided the close contact between water and plant may have contributed to this under the conditions applied in this study the reuse of treated agro industrial wastewater for irrigation can be considered an effective way to cope with agricultural water shortage in the mediterranean area keywords agro industrial wastewater wastewater reclamation wastewater reuse soil contamination crop yield quality 1 introduction a number of mediterranean countries suffer from water scarcity which has become severe in recent years due to global climate change causing frequent and long lasting periods of drought particularly during the summer these areas experience severe water supply and demand imbalances in the last decades many italian regions have faced the negative impact of drought and the resource scarcity has mostly penalized agricultural activities which uses more than 50 of the total available water while other high priority demands such as those from civil and industrial sectors are satisfied coppola et al 2004 particularly in apulia region south eastern italy water shortage has a serious impact on the local economy mostly based on agriculture moreover the agricultural coastal areas of apulia region suffer from relevant phenomena of seawater intrusion into the water table due to the excessive and often uncontrolled groundwater withdrawals for irrigation libutti and monteleone 2012 for these reasons alternative water sources are needed treated municipal wastewater is the most readily available source of water to meet the increasing demand for crop irrigation indeed in recent years wastewater recycling in agriculture has gained importance as component of agricultural water supply in several water scarce countries qadir et al 2007 pedrero et al 2010 wastewater reuse not only provides significant amount of irrigation water but also contributes to conserve potable resources and reduces the environmental impact related to the effluents discharge into water bodies aiello et al 2007 pedrero et al 2010 agrafioti and diamadopoulos 2012 furthermore soil application of treated wastewater also constitutes a reliable source of nutrients especially nitrogen phosphorus and potassium and organic matter useful for maintaining the fertility and the productivity of the soil meli et al 2002 rusan et al 2007 treated wastewater use for crop irrigation can improve growth and yield of herbaceous species kiziloglu et al 2008 bedbabis et al 2010 and can also enhance the economic benefits for farmers due to reduced need for fertilizer bedbabis et al 2010 paranychianakis et al 2006 however the chemical composition of wastewater has to be monitored to avoid imbalance in nutrient supply which may result in excessive vegetative growth uneven fruit maturity reduced quality and quantity of yields pedrero et al 2010 treated wastewater should be used for irrigation under controlled conditions also to minimize hazards to agricultural products soil and groundwater from toxic and pathogenic contaminants aiello et al 2007 qadir et al 2007 wastewater may contain a variety of pollutants such as salts heavy metals organic compounds enteric bacteria and viruses an excessive accumulation of trace metals such as cd cu fe mn pb and zn in soils through irrigation creates problems for agricultural production singh et al 2004 and leads to metal uptake by crops so affecting food quality and safety khan et al 2008 one of the crucial issues in the reuse of treated wastewater for crop irrigation is the residual presence of pathogenic microorganism rubino and lonigro 2008 petterson et al 2011 which represents a potential health risk to consumers when they enter in the food chain toze 2006 in italy there are strict regulations for reclaimed wastewater reuse decree no 152 2006 ministry for environment especially for levels of some chemical compounds and for microbial parameters with regard to microbiological contamination levels the corresponding guidelines allow unrestricted crop irrigation with a bacteriological effluent quality characterized by less than 10 cfu 100ml 1 of e coli in 80 of samples several experimental evidences underline the effect on soil and yield of reclaimed urban wastewater application for vegetable and fruit crops irrigation in the mediterranean area lonigro et al 2007 palese et al 2009 disciglio et al 2014 lonigro et al 2015 gatta et al 2016 our research activity focuses instead on treated agro industrial wastewater reuse in agriculture the reused agro industrial wastewater was originated by an agricultural and food manufacturing company which produces and processes vegetables in apulia region southern italy studies about the reuse of wastewater of agro industrial origin for crop irrigation have been little evaluated and are poorly documented in literature recovery of this type of wastewater is instead of particular relevance in the apulia region where the economic system is strongly based on irrigated agriculture and characterized by a widespread presence of agro food industries whose activity annually releases large quantities of wastewater usually discharged into torrents or rivers moreover apulia is one of the european regions most heavily affected by water shortage xiloyannis et al 2002 in this contest a careful management of agro industrial wastewater for agricultural purposes represents a useful alternative to conventional water resources allows to support irrigated agriculture reduces costs and environmental impact of wastewater disposal these advantages become even more useful when vegetable processing companies produce wastewater and grow the crops at the same site as in the case study reported in this work more specifically the present paper reports the results of a 1 5 year research on irrigating vegetable crops with this type of water source in southern italy two treatment schemes were applied to wastewater and the treated effluents were used for the irrigation of a test field where processing tomato and broccoli crops were cultivated in close succession with reference to the experimental trial described here others papers reporting the results of the first tomato crop cycle have been already published disciglio et al 2015 gatta et al 2015a b unlike all these cited studies which had the objectives to evaluate the effects of secondary treated agro industrial wastewater on different soil and tomato crop yield characteristics the present paper deals with the irrigation use of an additional treated wastewater type such as the tertiary treated wastewater and a longer experimental period such as the succession of three cropping cycles in order to assess i the impact of treated wastewater on the main chemical properties of irrigated soil ii the effects of treated wastewater on quantitative and qualitative aspects of crops yield iii the risk of microbiological contamination of irrigated soil and the pathogen health risk of crop products 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental site the study was carried out in open field from april 2012 to september 2013 in the north west part of the apulia region southern italy at stornarella 41 15 n 15 44 e altitude 154m a s l in the foggia district the area is characterized by a mediterranean climate with air temperatures that drops below 0 in winter and exceed peaks of 40 c in summer the long term average annual rainfall is 590mm with precipitations unevenly distributed throughout the year and predominantly concentrated in the period from october to april caliandro et al 2005 during the experimental period the daily meteorological parameters such as maximum and minimum air temperature tmax tmin maximum and minimum air relative humidity rhmax rhmin wind speed ws and total precipitation p were recorded these were measured by a weather station placed close to the experimental field and recorded using a data logger campbell scientific usa the study area is characterized by a widespread presence of agro food industries specialized in vegetables processing the experimental site was located within the fiordelisi agricultural and food manufacturing company fiordelisi s activity includes growing processing packaging and marketing of preserved ready to eat vegetables such as tomato eggplant zucchini and pepper this activity involves the production of large quantities of wastewater that undergoes a purification process before being discharged according to local regulations to this purpose the fiordelisi company is equipped with a wastewater treatment plant wwtp the wwtp was upgraded in order to produce effluents suitable for reuse thus supplying the two types of treated wastewater used for crops irrigation during the experimental period one produced by the conventional treatment system and the other by the upgraded configuration the reclaimed water was then used within a closed circle system where the wastewater produced as a by product from vegetables processing becomes a water resource for vegetable crops irrigation according to the criteria of recycling treated wastewater as a component of agricultural water supply in water scarce environmental conditions in the years 2012 and 2013 the fiordelisi company produced about 100 000m3y 1 of wastewater mainly composed of washing and processing water vegetables cooking steaming bottles washing etc water from cleaning floors and equipment and toilet water 5 10 the wastewater was purified in the wwtp fig 1 based on the following processes i primary treatments such as screening oil removal equalization and ph adjustment ii secondary treatments such as activated sludge process anoxic plus aerobic phases and chemically assisted secondary sedimentation iii tertiary treatments such as chlorination applied only during the period 01 october 2012 31 march 2013 sand filtration membrane ultrafiltration by 8 modules hyflux kristal 600et with a nominal surface of 60m2 and a nominal pore size of 0 05μm and uv radiation by 6 mercury vapor lamps 200w each the effluent of the secondary sedimentation is called secondary treated wastewater sw whereas the uv outlet is called tertiary treated wastewater tw sw and membrane filtered effluent were conveyed to the respective 10m3 storage tanks in order to maximize its effectiveness and save on energy costs the uv disinfection system was operated in line with irrigation thus the tw was disinfected just before being distributed to the plants on demand disinfection fig 1 periodical backwashing of the sand filter 15min duration every 8h of operation and the ultrafiltration membranes 30s duration every 45min of operation was performed with the membrane permeate membranes were also cleaned chemically with diluted soda and sodium hypochlorite approximately every 10days according to the procedures suggested by the manufacturer membrane ultrafiltration was monitored for the operating pressure and the permeate flux the experiments were carried out in a clay loam soil usda classification with a field capacity 0

crop cycle the seedlings were transplanted in double rows 40cm apart spaced at 250cm at a distance of 30cm along each single row realizing a final plant density of 2 7 plants m 2 tomato and broccoli plants were grown under a net house structure which was covered with an anti hail net in particular tomato plants were grown vertically using nylon threads positioned between the plant collar and iron wires arranged longitudinally in the direction of the plant rows and fixed to the upper part of the net house at 2 5m from the ground during each growing season the plants were irrigated whenever the soil water deficit in the effective root zone 0 50cm in depth was 40 of the total available soil water allen et al 1998 this irrigation threshold was assessed through a continuous monitoring of the volumetric soil water content using probes operating in the frequency domain reflectometry and installed in each plot prior to crops transplanting at 5 15 25 35 and 45cm soil depth at each irrigation the soil water content was increased to field capacity with a water volume varying from 100 to 400m3 ha 1 depending on the crop growth stage the seasonal irrigation volumes were 4957m3 ha 1 for tomato crop in 2012 922m3 ha 1 for broccoli crop in 2012 2013 and 4070m3 ha 1 for tomato crop in 2013 a drip irrigation method was used for the three crops this compriseda single drip line with drippers at 2l h 1 flow rate spaced every 40cm and placed in the middle of each couple of plant rows during the two tomato crop cycles the drip lines were placed under a black plastic mulching film all agricultural management practices including fertilization weed and pest control applied to the three crops were performed according to the agronomic techniques commonly adopted by local farmers before transplanting the soil was subsoiled to a depth of 45cm and its surface was milled a pre transplanting fertilization was then applied by distributing 35kgha 1 n and 70kgha 1 p2o5 before the two tomato cropping cycles started and 21kgha 1 n and 35kgha 1 p2o5 before the broccoli cropping cycle started throughout each of the two tomato crop cycles 75kgha 1 n and 100kgha 1 p2o5 were added through fertirrigation during the broccoli crop cycle a top dressing fertilization was applied to the soil by distributing 63kgha 1 n 2 3 experimental layout during the first tomato crop cycle two irrigation treatments were applied irrigation with gw and irrigation with sw during the broccoli and the second tomato crop cycles a third treatment was also considered irrigation with tw the tertiary treatment of wastewater produced by fiordelisi company was introduced in september 2012 just before the start of the broccoli crop cycle to produce effluents with lower suspended solids and microbiological pollution gw represents the irrigation source normally used by local farmers for crop irrigation it was withdrawn from a phreatic well located near the experimental field and stored in a 10m3 tank before being used for tomato and broccoli irrigation fig 1 gw sw and tw were directly pumped from their storage tanks to the drip irrigation system used for plants watering fig 2 as previously mentioned tw was uv disinfected in line with the distribution the experimental field was arranged according to a complete randomized block design with the irrigation treatments gw sw and tw each one replicated three times for a total of 6 plots for the first tomato crop 2 irrigation treatments 3 replicates and 9 plots for the broccoli and the second tomato crops 3 irrigation treatments 3 replicates fig 2 each plot was 450m2 15m wide 30m long with a sampling area of 20m2 2 5m wide 8 0m long 2 4 water soil plant and crops product sampling the raw 1 1 wastewater before purification in wastewater treatment plant agro industrial wastewater produced by fiordelisi rw was collected after the equalization step fig 1 samples of sw immediately after the settling process sampling point 1 in fig 1 samples of membrane permeate immediately after membrane ultrafiltration sampling point 2 in fig 1 and samples of tw immediately after the uv disinfection sampling point 3 in fig 1 were collected sampling was performed monthly from october 2012 to september 2013 irrigation water samples gw sw and tw were collected monthly over the whole irrigation period of each crop after tank storage and immediately before their inlet in the irrigation system fig 2 at each sampling date three samples of each water type were collected using sterile 1000 ml glass bottles and transported to the laboratory in refrigerated bags they were then kept in a refrigerator at 4 c and examined within 24h of collection soil samples were collected in triplicate from the gw sw and tw irrigated plots before each crop transplantation and at monthly intervals during each crop cycle all soil samples were taken from a 0 30cm soil layer high density root zone from under the drippers by using a soil auger they were air dried and passed through a 2mm sieve before the laboratory analysis during each growing season samples of tomato and broccoli plants were collected at the same time of soil sampling in triplicates from each experimental plot samples of tomato fruits and broccoli heads were collected at each harvesting date from the sampling area of 20m2 of each experimental plot plants tomato fruits and broccoli heads were immediately transported to the laboratory in refrigerated bags and analyzed within few hours from the sampling 2 5 water soil plant and crops product analysis all

microbiological analysis of the soil plant and product samples from each experimental treatment included the determination of the parameters showed in table 1 these analyses were conducted by the spread plate method as follows 25 0g of each sample was weighed and added to 225 0ml buffered peptone water homogenized in a stomacher for 180s then serial 10 fold dilutions in buffered peptone water were spread onto agar plates containing tbx for e coli c ec agar for fecal coliforms and tryptic soy agar for total heterotrophic count the plates were incubated under different incubation temperatures and times as follows 37 c for e coli 24h 44 c for fecal coliforms 48h and 22 c for total heterotrophic count 72h at each harvesting date tomato fruits and broccoli heads from each gw sw and tw irrigated plot were analyzed for quantitative traits all the marketable and discarded tomato fruits and broccoli heads were counted and weighed respectively to estimate the yield parameters table 1 at the same time a sample of 10 tomato fruits and a sample of 10 broccoli heads from each plot were transported to the laboratory and immediately analyzed for qualitative traits table 1 the color parameters of tomato fruits were measured using a cm 700d spectrophotometer minolta camera co ltd osaka japan as the cielab coordinates i e l a b on four randomly selected areas of the fruit surface here only the a b ratio 2 2 a red green chromaticity negative values indicate green while positive values indicate red b yellow blu chromaticity negative values indicate blue while positive values indicate yellow so the higher the a b ratio the higher the red color of tomato fruit is reported which represents an index that describes well the color changes of tomato fruit francis and clydesdale 1975 favati et al 2009 the cation and the anion contents of both tomato fruits and broccoli heads were determined by ion exchange chromatography dionex ics 1100 dionex corporation sunnyvale ca usa 2 6 statistical analysis the data related to the physico chemical characteristics of the two irrigation waters and the corresponding irrigated soils the quantitative and qualitative parameters of the crop products the microbiological properties of the irrigation waters soils plants and crop products collected during the first tomato crop cycle were analyzed by unpaired t tests the same data detected on the three irrigation water sources and the corresponding irrigated soils plants and crop products during the broccoli and the second tomato crop cycles were statistically processed by analysis of variance anova when significant effects were detected p 0 05 mean multiple comparisons were performed according to tukey test two different statistical tests were applied because the considered experimental factor irrigation water had two levels irrigation water type gw and sw during the first tomato cropping cycle and three levels irrigation water type gw sw and tw during the following broccoli and tomato cropping cycles therefore for each experimental data two and three mean values were statistically discriminated by t test and tukey test in the first and second case respectively before being processed all the microbiological data were logarithmically transformed log10 x 1 when in water soil plant and crop product microbial indicators were not detected the corresponding levels were set equal to zero the addition of the unit value to x was necessary in order to prevent an impossible solution in case of x 0 all the statistical analyses were performed using the jmp software package version 8 1 jmp 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatic conditions the average monthly values of the meteorological parameters recorded during the experimental period are reported in table 2 during the tomato 2012 and tomato 2013 growing seasons mean values of air temperature were similar rainfall was higher in 2013 than in 2012 with 43 of total precipitation occurred in august in 2012 62 of total precipitation was recorded in the first part of cultivation cycle in april during the broccoli 2012 2013 growing season rainfall was characterized by an almost regular distribution over the months with a peak in november when 36 of total precipitation occurred 3 2 physico chemical properties of water from wastewater treatment plant the average values of the main physico chemical parameters measured in rw sw and tw from wwtp are reported in table 3 where also the italian standards for reuse in irrigation of reclaimed wastewater are showed rw had low ph high salinity and a considerable presence of tss organic substances as demonstrated by the high cod value and surfactants the activated sludge process and the following secondary settling effectively removed most suspended solids and organic substances as well as nitrogen and phosphorus with average removal percentages of 89 96 86 94 and respectively as previously reported the tertiary treatment of wastewater was introduced in september 2012 before broccoli crop cycle started the main objective was to remove the residual suspended solids and the microbiological pollution which represented the main non compliances for the sw with respect to the standards for reuse in agriculture table 3 the influent pressure to the sand filter was maintained between 1 5 and 2 0bar and the residual pressure in the influent to the membranes was constantly at 0 5 0 6bar the average flow produced was 12m3 h 1 corresponding to a specific flux of the membranes of 25lm 2 h 1 during the first 6 months october 2012 march 2013 of tertiary treatment operation in correspondence of broccoli cropping cycle the sand filtration unit was preceded by a chlorination step this removed completely the monitoring indicator e coli whose concentration was always below 10 cfu 100ml 1 in both the influent to the sand filtration unit and in the tw from march 2013 the chlorination step was stopped this allowed to evaluate the effect of the ultrafiltration and uv radiation processes on e coli removal fig 3 a residual presence of suspended solids and e coli was observed in the membrane permeate indicating a possible leakage for one or more modules membrane integrity was then checked through a pressure decay test astm 2003 which indicated the presence of leakages in 6 modules out of 8 nevertheless the concentration of suspended solids in the membrane permeate was on average within the limit for reuse 10mgl 1 before uv disinfection which was performed on line with the irrigation the tw was stored in the 10m3 tank fig 1 for a period between 1 and 7days depending on the irrigation needs in the storage tank the concentration of suspended solids tended to increase during this time possibly due to bacterial re growth and reached an average value of 17 5 9 4mgl 1 fig 3 this phenomenon may have limited the effectiveness of the uv disinfection which is known to decrease with increasing turbidity indeed the removal of the fecal indicator e coli after the uv radiation varied between 0 5 and 3 log units fig 3 3 3 physico chemical properties of irrigation water table 4 shows the physico chemical properties of gw sw and tw measured during tomato 2012 broccoli 2012 2013 and tomato 2013 growing seasons the characteristics of the three sources of irrigation water resulted significantly different during each crop cycle on the contrary for each type of irrigation water very low differences were observed among the crop cycles the three water sources were alkaline with a significantly higher ph for gw than sw and tw only during the broccoli 2012 2013 growing season compared with gw sw and tw were always characterized by higher values of nh4 n and no2 n p k ca and mg the presence of these chemical components in treated wastewater is very interesting from an agronomic point of view since they represent important nutrients for improving soil fertility plant growth and crop yield rodriguez liébana et al 2014 with respect to gw sw and tw had also a higher content of organic matter as indicated by bod5 and cod values and significantly higher values of na ec and sar according to ayers and westcot 1985 as regards the ec and na values observed in the two treated wastewaters their reuse for irrigation can be considered from slightly to moderately restricted moreover if the values of sar are related to the values of ec it follow that their application would not cause a reduction of the infiltration rate into the soil also hardness and tss were significantly higher in the two treated wastewaters than in gw during the whole experimental period gw had significantly higher no3 n concentration 29 06 23 19 and 22 98mgl 1 during the three crop cycles respectively than the other two water sources the high concentration of no3 n in gw is due to the nitrate contamination of the aquifer since in the study area intensive agricultural activity has led to extensive and frequently excessive nitrogen fertilizer applications to the crops the resulting nitrogen surplus in the soil is then particularly exposed to the leaching risk thus increasing the problem of groundwater nitrate pollution libutti and monteleone 2017 this elevated no3 n content in gw represents an important source of nutrient for the plants but unfortunately it is not always taken into account by farmers in the crop fertilization planning as regards the other parameters so4 2 co3 2 and hco3 they had always similar levels in the three irrigation water sources the values for the main physico chemical water properties for gw sw and tw met the italian standards for treated wastewater reuse legislative decree no 152 2006 except for the tss and bod5 for sw and tw slightly exceeding the limit set by the legislation 10mgl 1 and 20mg o2 l 1 respectively while a non compliance for the parameter tss is common for a secondary settled effluent in the case of tw this was due to two factors specific of this case study i e the leakage of ultrafiltration membranes and the bacterial re growth in the storage tank nevertheless for both sw and tw the concentration of tss was far below the limit of 50mgl 1 established to avoid clogging problems in drip irrigation systems ayers and westcot 1985 concerning the bod5 the observed values of this parameter may not be considered a limiting factor for treated wastewater reuse since they indicate that both sw and tw were a source of organic matter for the irrigated soil this aspect has been also highlighted by others studies which proposed to skip the biological processes in the reclamation process in order to save the agronomic potential of organic matter and nutrients contained in the urban wastewater lopez et al 2006 lonigro et al 2007 palese et al 2009 3 4 chemical properties of soil the main chemical properties of the 0 30cm soil layer in gw sw and tw irrigated plots over the tomato 2012 broccoli 2012 2013 and tomato 2013 growing seasons are reported in table 5 significant differences between gw and sw irrigated plots were observed in some soil chemical properties during the tomato 2012 growing season the use of sw for crop irrigation resulted in a significant increase of nh4 n na and consequently of ec and sar of the soil these results are consistent with the chemical properties of the irrigation water indeed the higher nh4 n concentration in sw than in gw table 4 resulted in a higher nh4 n concentration in the corresponding irrigated plots even though part of the nh4 n supplied through irrigation water was readily available for plants growth most of it was adsorbed to the negative charged clay particle surface of sw irrigated soil duan et al 2010 similarly the higher concentration of na in sw if compared with gw resulted in a higher na concentration in the corresponding irrigated plots this result is in line with previous studies najafi and nasr 2009 mojiri 2011 because of the higher na concentration in sw than in gw also the ec of the soil in sw irrigated plots was much higher twice as big than the values observed in gw irrigated plots and in sw irrigated plots before the experimental period started 0 45 and 0 50dsm 1 respectively rusan et al 2007 reported similar results khai et al 2008 and mojiri 2011 stated that the increase of ec in soil irrigated with wastewater was mainly due to the original higher concentration of cations such as na and k nevertheless ec values observed in sw soil remained below the indicative threshold value 4 00dsm 1 beyond which a soil is defined as saline qadir et al 2000 also as regards the sar of the soil the significant difference between sw and gw plots was probably due to na accumulation in the root zone when sar is in the range of 12 15 damages to the physical characteristics of the soil may occur munshower 1994 however the calculated sar value was clearly below the limit of 15 above which a soil can be considered sodic us salinity laboratory staff 1954 although no3 n concentration was higher in gw than in sw no significant differences between gw and sw plots were observed in terms of no3 n content in the 0 30cm soil this suggest that the no3 n contained in gw was in part utilized by the crop and the possible no3 n in excess of plants requirements so not adsorbed by tomato plants was likely moved below the0 30cmsoil layer due to its high mobility in the soil yuan et al 2000 shamrukh et al 2001 over the broccoli growing season 2012 2013 significantly higher ph value was measured in sw than tw irrigated plots table 5 in comparison with tw soil the ph of sw soil raised of 0 2 units to an average value of 8 48 this was likely due to the higher accumulation although not significantly so of basic cations particularly ca2 and mg2 from irrigation water in sw than tw irrigated plots table 4 increase of soil ph by approximately 0 8 units under irrigation with treated wastewater has been reported by tarchouna et al 2000 previously also mancino and pepper 1992 found that irrigation with treated wastewater raised the soil ph by 0 1 0 2 units when compared with irrigation with drinking water these authors attributed such a ph rise to the high content of basic cations of the wastewater which raised the alkaline reserve of the soil particularly the average values for ca2 and mg2 in the soil were significantly higher in sw and tw than in gw irrigated plots this result was consistent with the higher ca2 and mg2 concentration of sw and tw than gw table 4 and likely indicated that the treated wastewater input for these chemical species was higher than the broccoli plants uptake as observed during the previous tomato cycle also over the broccoli growing season no differences were found in no3 n concentration of sw and tw irrigated soils with respect to gw soil no3 n amount in the 0 30cm soil layer was similar among the three irrigation water sources and lower than the previous crop cycle this result can be explained considering that during the broccoli cycle the high rainfall associated with the limited rate of no3 n uptake by the plants contributed to the removal of the no3 n supplied by irrigation water and not utilized by the crop from the upper to the deeper soil layers by drainage water a study of arregui and quemada 2006 showed that in mediterranean climate nitrogen leaching easily occurs in the autumn winter season when crop nitrogen demand is low precipitation exceeds crop evapotranspiration and considerable drainage took place along the soil profile differently from the previous tomato cycle there were no significant effects on soil salinity due to use of treated wastewater for broccoli irrigation particularly the ec values measured on sw and tw irrigated soils were very low 0 28 and 0 27dsm 1 respectively despite the fact that ec values and na concentrations in sw and tw were significantly higher than in gw for the three types of irrigation water ec in the soil remarkably decreased not only with respect to the previous crop cycle but also with respect to the value of ec measured before the start of the experimental period 0 49dsm 1 as well as for no3 this was due to the high rainfall occurred during the broccoli cycle libutti and monteleone 2012 monteleone and libutti 2012 over the tomato growing season 2013 there were no significant effects of the irrigation with treated wastewater neither sw or tw on any of the measured chemical parameters of the soil table 5 the data observed in the 0 30cm soil showed similar soil fertility levels for the three irrigation water sources although sw and tw had always higher bod5 and cod values than gw no significant differences were observed among the average values of om in gw sw and tw irrigated soils over the three growing seasons it is possible that a rapid mineralization of the organic material supplied through the irrigation with treated wastewater occurred gloaguen et al 2007 observed a decrease of organic carbon in the soil after the irrigation with treated wastewater and hypothesized that this was related to an increase of the soil microbiological activity due to the labile carbon supplied by wastewater similarly for the three crops there were no significant differences among the average concentrations of total n and p2o5 in gw sw and tw irrigated soils as observed in the studies of midrar et al 2004 and heidarpour et al 2007 3 5 microbiological properties of water soil plant and crops product the microbiological properties of the three irrigation water sources gw sw and tw divided by growing seasons are reported in table 6 gw had a content of e coli below the current italian threshold of 10 cfu 100ml 1 for wastewater reuse legislative decree no 152 2006 during the tomato 2012 growing season and was free of this fecal indicator during the broccoli 2012 2013 and tomato 2013 growing seasons fecal coliforms and fecal enterococci were always detected in gw over the three cropping seasons but at considerably lower concentration than those observed for the two treated wastewaters with respect to gw and tw sw had always a significantly higher concentration of e coli well above the local limit for reuse fecal coliforms and fecal enterococci tw had a very low residual fecal contamination during the broccoli 2012 2013 growing season with the total absence of e coli and average levels of 0 20 log cfu 100ml 1 and 0 42 log cfu 100ml 1 for fecal coliforms and fecal enterococci respectively a higher average concentration of e coli 2 08 log cfu 100ml 1 fecal coliforms and fecal enterococci 2 20 log cfu 100ml 1 and 1 82 log cfu 100ml 1 respectively were observed in tw during the tomato 2013 growing season this was due to the membrane failure and to a minor extent to the bacterial re growth occurred in tw storage tank because of these two factors the turbidity of the treated wastewater so increased to a level that hampered the uv disinfection efficiency fig 3 for the three irrigation water types salmonella spp was never isolated in any of the analyzed samples as required by the above cited legislation regarding the microbiological properties of the soil table 6 e coli was never isolated in any of the gw sw and tw soil samples over the three crop cycles despite the presence of e coli in gw during the tomato 2012 growing season in sw during the entire experimental period and in tw during the tomato 2013 growing season this could be due to the die off of this indicator as reported by several other studies lang et al 2007 van elsas et al 2011 however it has to be stated that it is not possible to exclude the presence of e coli in the analyzed soil samples since the sensitivity of the applied method is 100cfug 1 samarajeewa et al 2010 and a loss of cultivability of e coli may also have led to underestimation fecal coliforms were isolated in all soil samples but at levels not significantly different among the three irrigation water treatments particularly in gw irrigated soils a high concentration of fecal coliforms was observed over the three growing seasons if compared with the low presence of these indicators in the corresponding irrigation water similar result was obtained in tw irrigated soil during the broccoli 2012 2013 growing season this suggests that the presence of fecal coliforms in the soil may be also caused by sources of contamination different from the irrigation water such as roaming animals birds and runoff mawdsley et al 1995 venglovsky et al 2006 high level of total heterotrophic count were observed in all soil samples these resulted not significantly different among the three irrigation water treatments during the two tomato growing seasons on the contrary during the broccoli 2012 2013 growing season significantly higher level of total heterotrophic count were observed in gw than in tw irrigated soil concerning the microbiological analysis of plant and product of the crops e coli was not isolated in any of the analyzed samples overall fecal coliforms were found to be lower on the crop products than on the plant and moreover their values were not influenced by the water used for irrigation also the total heterotrophic count that accounts for the autochthonous microorganism of soil and the possible input of microorganisms from the irrigation water was not influenced by the water type except for the broccoli plants for which the total heterotrophic count resulted higher on sw than on tw irrigated plants the low levels of microbial indicators on plants and crop products can be explained by a substantial lack of contact between irrigation water soil plants and edible parts of the plant these results are in agreement with the findings of a previous study cirelli et al 2012 that reports the contamination of tomato and eggplant fruits by fecal bacteria only in case of direct contact with the soil irrigated with treated municipal wastewater as already reported for the soil contamination also the presence of fecal coliforms on plant and product irrigated with gw during the tomato 2012 growing season was likely due to other sources of contamination 3 6 quantitative and qualitative properties of crops product data reported in table 7 show the quantitative traits of crop products observed over the three considered growing seasons during the tomato 2012 growing seasons marketable yield my was higher although not significantly so for gw than sw as already reported by gatta et al 2015a this appears to be mainly due to the higher nonmarketable yield nmy for sw with respect to gw during the broccoli 2012 2013 growing season significantly lower values of my and significantly higher values of nmy were observed for sw and tw than gw treatment table 7 there are very few researches in literature about the use of reclaimed wastewater for broccoli crop irrigation and they focus on the accumulation of macro and micro nutrients in plant and soil kalavrouziotis et al 2008a 2008b 2009 no literature data about the productive response of broccoli crop to irrigation with treated wastewater are available however the broccoli yield value observed in the present experimental trial is roughly in agreement with the data obtained by candido et al 2001 in a field trial carried out with a conventional irrigation water source in an agricultural area of southern italy similar to that of the present study and aimed to compare different irrigation methods in order to increase the efficiency of irrigation water as during the tomato 2012 and 2013 growing season a higher my for gw with respect to sw and tw treatments was detected although the differences were not statistically significant the yields of tomato fruit observed in both the two growing seasons are roughly in agreement with the results obtained by aiello et al 2007 in an experimental trial carried out in southern italy they reported a higher my from the tomato missouri genotype irrigated with freshwater than the same genotype irrigated with treated wastewater compared to the yields observed for the missouri genotype in the above mentioned study the my obtained in the present study for the manila variety were lower this might be due to several factors such as the differences between the genetic constitution of the two cultivars the characteristics of the treated wastewater or also the pedo environmental conditions of the cultivation areas gatta et al 2015a the qualitative traits of crop products are showed in table 8 significant differences between the two irrigation water sources gw and sw were observed for the ph of fruits during the tomato 2012 growing season in particular a higher ph value in gw than sw treatment was detected ph is a very important parameter for the evaluation of tomato fruits quality since it influences the processing thermal condition required to control microbial spoilage and enzyme inactivation and obtain safe products garcia and barret 2006 ph values in this study were within the same range 4 32 4 56 obtained by madrid et al 2009 this ph range is typical of tomato fruits hong et al 2000 and shows their slightly acid nature the irrigation water had no effect on titrable acidity ta of tomato fruits data here presented are very close to the mean acidity of processing tomatoes that is generally of about 0 35 garcia and barret 2006 also soluble solids content of the flesh ssc values showed no significant difference between the two irrigation water sources nevertheless a slightly higher ssc was observed in gw 5 73 brix than sw 5 53 brix madrid et al 2009 and favati et al 2009 reported lower ssc values than those observed in the present study these differences could be due to several factors among which the tomato genotype used sgherri et al 2007 2008 the environmental drought mahajan and singh 2006 soraya et al 2001 and the climatic conditions such as temperature co2 concentration and light however high ssc improves the efficiency of tomato fruits processing johnstone et al 2005 and has direct implication for the tomato canning industry richardson and hobson 2006 because of the minor quantity of energy necessary to evaporate water from the fruits when producing tomato paste or concentrated juice favati et al 2009 richardson and hobson 2006 higher solid content in fruits is therefore a target characteristic as this would reduce the cost for processing and serves as the basis for fixing the price to be paid to the producer turhan and seniz 2009 as well as for ssc also high dry matter content dm is a desirable characteristic for the canning tomatoes industry since it improves the quality of the processed product de pascale et al 2001 results here presented showed dm values not different between gw and sw 7 44 vs 7 52 and acceptable for industrial processing moreover they are in agreement with the findings of turhan and seniz 2009 which observed dm values ranging from 4 to 7 in a wide field experiment carried out in the mediterranean basin aiming to compare the quality characteristics of 33 tomato genotypes regarding fruits size no relevant effects of the irrigation water source were observed on mean diameter d and color index ci the latter which is commonly used as a quality redness index brightness of red colour of tomatoes was found in the range from 0 97 to 1 14 these data were also in agreement with the a b range from 0 95 to 1 21 observed by batu 2004 on tomato fruits at the red stage of maturity from a greenhouse experiment as regards the anions and cations content of fruits during the tomato 2012 growing season na and no3 concentrations were significantly influenced by the irrigation with treated wastewater na was higher in sw than gw 11 05 vs 9 15mg 100g 1 of fresh matter likely due to the significantly higher na content in sw in comparison with gw table 4 on the contrary no3 content was significantly higher in gw than sw treatment 1 32 vs 0 92mg 100g 1 of fresh matter in agreement with the higher no3 n concentration of gw table 4 however no3 content of tomato fruits were well below the nitrate levels in vegetables as defined by the european guidelines european union regulation n 1258 2011 currently adopted in italy except for ca2 and na contents the observed results are in agreement with other studies guil guerrero and rebolloso fuentes 2009 according to the data of table 8 over the broccoli 2012 2013 growing season most of the qualitative traits of crop yield were not significantly different among the three irrigation water sources although not statistically different dm and d were respectively higher in sw and tw than gw on the contrary for broccoli heads significant differences in na and no3 content were observed na was significantly higher when plants were irrigated with sw and tw than with gw no3 was higher in plants irrigated with gw than in those irrigated with sw and tw these results clearly reflect the different values of na and no3 among the three irrigation water sources table 4 also in this case the no3 content in broccoli heads was below the above mentioned limits for nitrate concentration in vegetables during the tomato 2012 2013 growing season the qualitative traits measured in tomato fruits confirmed the results obtained in the first tomato crop cycle for dm d ci ssc ta and ph there were no significant differences among gw sw and tw water sources all the obtained values were within the typical range for tomato fruits and also in agreement with the results of other studies as already reported with respect to the tomato growing season 2012 as regards the na and ca2 content of the fruits higher values were found in tomato growing season 2013 than in tomato growing season 2012 moreover during the second cycle the irrigation water significantly affected the ca2 content of the fruits which resulted higher for crops irrigated with gw if compared with those irrigated with sw and tw except for ca2 and k contents these results are in agreement with the mineral content of tomato fruits reported by other authors guil guerrero and rebolloso fuentes 2009 4 conclusions this paper presents a 1 5 year field study of reuse of treated agro industrial wastewater secondary treated wastewater after activated sludge process and sedimentation and tertiary treated wastewater after ultrafiltration and uv radiation were used to irrigate two vegetable species in succession processing tomato and broccoli in a closed system where an agri food company cultivated and processed vegetables and had wastewater as by product the findings of the present study indicate that agro industrial effluents have the potential to be recycled for irrigation after a tertiary treatment composed of ultrafiltration and on demand uv disinfection processes the yield of tomato and broccoli crops as well as the most important qualitative parameters of tomato fruits i e dry matter content soluble solid content titratable acidity ph and broccoli heads i e dry matter content diameter were not influenced by the irrigation with treated wastewater the microbiological characteristics of the two treated wastewaters were considerably different from the conventional water source groundwater and also between each other nevertheless the microbiological quality of the tomato fruits and broccoli heads was not affected by the type of irrigation water used the die off of fecal indicators in the soil and the drip irrigation method by reducing the direct contact between the water and the plant limited the possible contamination of the crops products moreover this type of irrigation system reduces the amount of irrigation water that needs to be supplied so avoiding deep water percolation and surface water run off processes so it can be recommended for wastewater reuse in irrigation the knowledge on the reuse of treated agro industrial wastewater in irrigation is still scarce and more studies are needed to evaluate the quality of the treated effluent under different conditions in terms of both industrial processes and wastewater treatments and the long term effects on soil and plants however the findings presented in this paper suggest that this practice is an effective option to have a useful aternative to conventional water resources in areas where intensive agriculture is present and the sustainability of agricultural sector strongly depends on water availability indeed in the specific case reported the agro industrial wastewater reclamation the recovery and the reuse of the resulting treated water allowed to profit of about 10 000m3 ha 1 of water for irrigation of a succession of tomato and broccoli crops in a time period of 1 5 years so decreasing the stress on the conventional water resources in particular within the context of the experimental trial here reported this practice could save about 6000m3 ha 1 of groundwater every year acknowledgments this study was part of the project technology and process innovations for irrigation re use of treated municipal and agro industrial

11594,the agricultural sector of california is one of the most diverse and economically valuable in the world but is dominated by woody perennial and annual warm season crops dependent on irrigation these face potential problems from restrictions to irrigation water supply and climate change canola and camelina could be used to diversify cool season cropping in the state but the water use of these species in the region is poorly understood in this study both the total and temporal water use of canola and camelina under cool season production conditions in california were investigated using field based and computer modeling approaches total and temporal water use of both species were found to be similar to what has been observed in other regions under cool season conditions observed seasonal water uptake patterns also closely matched predictions by the agricultural production systems simulator apsim model these results inform the utilization of these species as new crops in california and also contribute to estimates of water use by these globally significant oilseeds under mediterranean to arid climate conditions keywords canola brassica napus camelina camelina sativa water use 1 introduction california s agricultural sector is one of the most diverse and economically valuable in the world but is dominated by woody perennial and annual warm season crops that require irrigation faostat 2015 tolomeo et al 2012 usda nass 2017 alternatives to irrigation dependent warm season annual crops are needed due to increases in competing demands for water together with projected increased variability and reduction in water supply under many climate change scenarios cayan et al 2008 cook et al 2015 jackson et al 2012 lee and six 2010 mann and gleick 2015 for example in california s central valley business as usual scenarios forecast 26 32 increases in irrigation water demand by 2099 mehta et al 2013 globally difficulties in forecasting regional rainfall and evaporation trends under climate change scenarios make predictions of future water constraints uncertain but the emerging consensus anticipates worsening water scarcity in regions that already experience dry conditions an area covering approximately 40 of the global land surface gosling and arnell 2016 ipcc 2014 schewe et al 2014 wiltshire et al 2013 one strategy to help farming in california adapt to a more water limited future is through increased use of annual cool season crops these are produced during the period of minimum evaporative demand fall to early spring and can utilize winter precipitation in the region s mediterranean to semi arid climate for some if not all of their water requirements currently the most extensively planted cool season crops in california are cereals tolomeo et al 2012 to facilitate adoption by growers new cool season crops should therefore complement or readily integrate with existing cereal production systems canola brassica napus has been used to diversify cereal based agricultural systems in multiple regions worldwide notably canada australia europe and the united states booth and gunstone 2004 duff et al 2006 pouzet 1994 usda nass 2017 suggesting it could be used as a cool season crop option in california relative to other winter oilseeds canola generally has the highest yield potential under favorable conditions but it can become unreliable when crop available water limits yield farré et al 2007 ncdc 2015 conditions that may prevail in some places and years of california the oilseed species camelina camelina sativa has lower yield potential than canola but is regarded by some as more reliable than canola under low input conditions and has a larger temperature range for crop establishment allen et al 2014 berti et al 2016 george et al 2017b jiang 2013 putnam et al 1993 and could therefore provide another winter annual alternative there is little commercial production of either canola or camelina in california at present although current studies suggest that both species have potential as crops in the region george et al 2017a winans et al 2016 the water use of both canola and camelina has been investigated but not under californian agro environmental conditions faraji et al 2009 hergert et al 2011 hocking et al 1997 hu et al 2015 hunsaker et al 2013 lenssen et al 2012 robertson and kirkegaard 2005 zeleke et al 2014 if canola and camelina are to be considered as cool season crops for adapting california agriculture to lower or more variable winter rainfall or to reduced irrigation water availability it will be necessary to develop a quantitative understanding of the water use of both species a broader understanding of the water used of canola and camelina can also assist in predicting potential yield responses and economic viability of these crops under differing scenarios of climatic variability müller and robertson 2014 as well as the potential risks and benefits of introducing crops into existing rotations for example nielsen et al 2005 thus while the work here is motivated by the potential to diversify californian winter production systems the findings have broader applicability especially given the importance of canola as the third largest vegetable oil source worldwide ers 2012 the computer crop model apsim has been used to identify crop strategies for optimizing the water use efficiency of both cereals and canola production in australia farré et al 2002 hochman et al 2009 robertson and kirkegaard 2005 apsim is a modeling framework that combines biophysical and management modules to simulate cropping systems it is used globally as a tool for both research and farm management holzworth et al 2014 keating et al 2003 the apsim canola module is used to simulate canola production in australia under both current and future climates farré et al 2007 farré et al 2002 holzworth et al 2014 kirkegaard et al 2016 kirkegaard et al 2003 luo et al 2010 mccormick et al 2015 robertson et al 1999 robertson and kirkegaard 2005 and george and kaffka 2017 recently demonstrated that the model can reliably simulate the phenology biomass accumulation and seed yields of canola production in california under a diverse range of edaphic climatic and management conditions apsim could therefore be a valuable tool for understanding and investigating the water use of canola in california and it would be worthwhile to test the accuracy of the model under californias conditions the apsim model is unable to simulate camelina at the present time here we report on work that estimated the water use of canola and camelina in california using multiple approaches the objectives of this work were to estimate the water use of canola and camelina under field conditions in relation to seed yield e g as measured by water use efficiency defined as the mass of seed production per unit area per mm water transpired to make initial estimates of crop coefficients kc that can then inform irrigation management to estimate the seasonal patterns of water use of canola and camelina and the spatial pattern of water use of both species throughout the soil profile and to use californian field data to test the ability of the apsim crop model to simulate the water use of canola 2 materials and methods 2 1 site details and seasonal weather information this work utilized data from existing multi environment yield trials of both canola and camelina that were conducted in california between 2012 and 2015 table 1 george et al 2017a seven trial sites were located to span the range of cool season cereal cropping in california and which represent all potential oilseed growing regions all sites receive almost all effective rainfall during the winter season mean seasonal rainfall volumes ranged from 80mm in the desert climate of el centro in southern california to 470mm at davis in northern california soil types at research sites were clays or loam variants notably the el centro site was situated on an arid paleolake with heavy clay soils and the tulelake site was on a recently drained lakebed with soils containing large amounts of dolomite smectitic clays and relatively high in organic matter at all locations soil fertility was non limiting for seed yield george et al 2017a suggesting the importance of variable water availability for production specific information regarding the multi environment trial sites and experimental methodology is provided by george et al 2017a all sites were managed using agronomic methods comparable to those used for commercial cereal production in the same locations production at all locations relied primarily on rainfall to meet crop water needs irrigation if available was used only if crops exhibited obvious water stress such as leaf wilting to prevent stand failure irrigation was delivered via sprinklers early in the season and then via either furrow or flood later in the season at sowing soil samples were taken from at least three locations in each field at depths of 0 50 50 100 100 150 and 150 200cm using a soil auger soil samples were used for the determination of soil volumetric water content and dry bulk density using soil volumetric water content and bulk density values the plant available volumetric water content in the total soil profile to depth of 200cm was estimated the reported maximum rooting depth of the species is approximately 200cm johnston et al 2002 and field observations made in soil profiles during this research observed negligible rooting below 150cm for either species chemical and physical analyses of soil samples to determine permanent wilting point and field capacity soil textural composition and nutrient concentrations were performed by a l western laboratories 1331 woodland ave suite 1 modesto ca 95351 as reported in table 1 weather data for the sites were obtained from the california irrigation management information system cimis 2015 the national climatic data center ncdc 2015 and from in field weather stations located at the research sites 2 2 volumetric soil water content monitoring and estimation of evapo transpiration etc at a subset of the research sites davis lockeford and west side the volumetric soil water content of the fields was measured using time domain reflectrometry tdr sensors 10hs soil moisture smart sensors and hobo u30 data loggers onset computer corporation 470 macarthur blvd bourne ma 02532 the sites were chosen because they had differing soil types davis silty clay loam clay loam lockeford loam westside clay that are nonetheless suitable for using tdrs for monitoring water content and because they are located in the central valley which is the largest contiguous cereal cropping zone of the state the tdr sensors were approximately 20cm long and installed vertically in the bottom of auger holes at approximately 10cm 50cm 100cm and 180cm below the soil surface each tdr sensor was installed in an individually augured hole spaced approximately 50cm from neighboring measurement points and in the middle of the individual crop plots the depths were selected in order to span the reported maximum rooting depth of the species 200cm johnston et al 2002 while having a higher density of measurements near the soil surface where soil water content was anticipated to be most variable two plots per species and field site were used one measured canola plot was planted to the variety hyclass 955 a short season spring type variety known to have high yield potential in california and a second was another short season spring type variety that varied by locations and year george et al 2017a for camelina one plot was planted to the variety so 50 a variety known to have superior performance in california and the other was a variety selected at random from the larger set of entries in the experimental layout george et al 2017a volumetric soil water content was logged by the tdr sensors between planting and harvest on a 15min basis wateruptake over time was estimated by depth interpolating the soil water content to a depth of 200cm and then computing the rate of change of water content per depth on a daily timescale increases in soil water content resulted from measured rainfall and irrigation and soil water depletion was attributed to evapotranspiration and deep drainage according to the mass balance 1 z i d θ i d t p i e t i q i i 1 q i 1 e t i q i i 1 here z i is the depth of soil layer i as observed at the tdr qi is the downward flow of water from layer i θ is the volumetric water content p the precipitation amount i the water application from irrigation and eti the rate of evaporation and transpiration from soil layer i total evapotranspiration is estimated by summing the estimate of eti for each soil layer water movement was assumed to be one dimensional i e negligible lateral flow a reasonable assumption given that all site slopes were 2 with deep soil profiles and deep water tables and thus no conditions to support a lateral water potential gradient the bottom profile boundary was assumed to drain freely a reasonable assumption for the deep well drained soils with unstructured soil profiles and water tables at least 10m or greater at each site characteristic of the floodplain derived soils of california s central valley nrcs 2015 two methods of estimating eti were compared which were expected to bound the true values of water uptake in the first approach all soil water depletion in the rooted profile was attributed to plant water uptake this approach likely over estimates true plant water use both because losses of water occurring due to any deep drainage are assigned to evapotranspiration and because all direct evaporation from the soil surface and plant canopy as well as transpiration losses were attributed to plant uptake in the second approach soil water depletion that occurred within two days of an irrigation or rainfall event was excluded from the estimation of plant water uptake this avoided attributing water losses from deep drainage and evaporation after rainfall to plant water use this approach likely under estimates evapotranspiration since rainfall and irrigation events were infrequent for example there were only ten rainfall events that delivered more than 10mm in a single day at davis the wettest location in both seasons the overall error introduced by this method was likely to be small because evaporation during the winter growing season in the region is relatively low cimis 2015 comparison of these two methods produced estimates that differed by only 25mm year data not presented therefore only the uncorrected data was used using these methods and assumptions total water content and the daily change in water content ascribed to plant uptake were plotted in depth time plots visualizing changes in the soil and in the plant water use profiles the mass balance approach used to estimate crop water use is subject to limitations and assumptions as discussed the water dynamics are assumed to be one dimensional i e no lateral flow the bottom boundary of the rooted profile is assumed to approximate a free drainage boundary a reasonable assumption since the depth to the water table based on information provided by individual research stations is on the order of 10m or greater at each site deep percolation other than in the period immediately after rain irrigation appeared to be minimal since only small changes in soil volumetric water content were recorded by the deepest tdrs implicitly we assume that the tdr sensors reliably capture the structure and dynamics of the subsurface water distribution the good agreement between plots supports this assumption see results nonetheless it is possible that preferential flow could cause infiltrating water to bypass individual sensors or conversely to be concentrated in the vicinity of the sensors furthermore tdr sensors are not expected to fully capture transpiration of water from near surface sources or evaporation from the soil surface or from water intercepted by the crop canopy and may therefore underestimate the evaporation portion of evapotranspiration crop water use efficiency was estimated by plotting crop water uptake against seed yield for the sample plots linear trend lines defining the upper boundary of the data were visually fitted to both species by linear regression amongst a subset of points that appeared to form an upper bound to the data see fig 1 this would represent the crop response to seasonal conditions when water is used the most efficiently due to its timing in relation to crop demand with minimal unproductive losses robertson and kirkegaard 2005 2 3 estimation of crop coefficients kc single crop coefficients kc for both canola and camelina were calculated using daily estimates of crop evapotranspiration etc and reference evapotranspiration eto from the closest cimis station using a weekly moving average and then aggregated to monthly timescales allen et al 1998 zeleke and wade 2012 the use of an averaging window reduces fluctuations induced by variable crop and reference evapotranspiration rates which otherwise propagate into large daily variations in the crop coefficient the crop phenological stages for canola used to interpret the monthly crop coefficients were based on visual field observations combined with simulations by the apsim crop model the phenological stages of camelina were based on field observations apsim 2015 george and kaffka 2017 2 4 seasonal water supply relative to yield the seasonal water supply was estimated for all sites based on the method of robertson and kirkegaard 2005 2 w p i s where w is the plant available water p is the precipitation throughout the growing season i total irrigation provided to the site s is the estimated starting soil water content in the soil profile to a depth of 200cm above the permanent wilting point for the soil considered to be the volumetric water content of the soil at matric potential of 1 5mpa the seasonal water supply for the sites was compared to the highest yielding varieties for the site as reported by george et al 2017a to establish a relationship between water supply and seed yield an upper boundary describing the maximum seasonal water use efficiency of canola described by the equation seed yield 10 6x 1243 x h2o in mm robertson and kirkegaard 2005 was compared with the seasonal water use efficiency estimated here the relationship between seasonal water supply and seed yield for camelina describing the approximate upper boundary of the camelina data was visually fitted in using the method described above 2 5 crop simulation modeling the agricultural production systems simulator apsim v 7 4 was parameterized using data from the from the davis lockeford and west side locations as reported in george and kaffka 2017 for each location apsim is a modular biophysical simulation model suitable for evaluating economic and environmental outcomes associated with crop production apsim contains separate simulation modules addressing plant soil and crop management which can be specified for different climate soil crop and variety conditions once suitably parameterized and validated for given crop soil climate combinations it can be used as a decision support for growers as well as a regional or production system level research tool apsim is extensively documented online at http www apsim info documentation aspx most relevant to this study is the soilwat module in apsim which controls soil water redistribution and usage soilwat discretizes a soil column into a series of layers eitzinger et al 2004 water content in each layer is bounded by a lower limit corresponding to wilting point and saturation during a rainfall event surface runoff is computed using the soil conservation service curve number method mishra and singh 2013 the remaining rainfall volume infiltrates into the upper soil layer and the water content in this layer is updated if the resulting water content is less than the upper limit equivalent to field capacity no further water distribution occurs if the updated water content exceeds the upper limit the remaining water drains to the next soil layer at a specified rate approximated by the saturated hydraulic conductivity unsaturated water redistribution also occurs when soil water content lies between the lower and upper limits and is specified by the soil water diffusivity water is removed from the surface soil layer by bare soil evaporation which occurs following a well known two stage model ritchie 1972 and by plant water uptake plant water uptake is determined by a plant specific factor and the difference between the volumetric soil water content in a given layer and a crop specific minimum volumetric soil water content for water uptake the climate module of apsim was initialized using inputs of maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation and rainfall obtained from the california irrigation management information system cimis 2015 from weather stations at each site generic soil types from the apsim database corresponding to conditions at each site were used and modified according to measured values for soil bulk density starting volumetric water content measured permanent wilting point volumetric water content of the soil at matric potential of 1 5mpa drained upper limit volumetric water content of the soil at matric potential of 0 3mpa nitrogen nitrate content and percent organic matter from field sites table 1 the management module of apsim was initialized using the agronomic management of canola crops at the individual research sites george et al 2017a the cumulative crop water uptake at the sites predicted by apsim was compared with the water uptake estimate generated use the tdr data 3 results and discussion 3 1 water uptake of canola and camelina in relation to yield a range of crop yields were observed during the study individual plot yields varied from stand failure to 2000kg ha for camelina and from 900 to 4800kg ha for canola and span the range of yields that can be commonly expected for camelina and canola in california george et al 2017a george and kaffka 2017 the yield variation between sites is attributed to the amount and timing of both rainfall and periods of low or high temperature george et al 2017a for example unusually cold and dry conditions during the 2013 14 season resulted in very poor stand establishment and survival for both species at the west side location and late season heat stress is believed to have depressed yields in el centro a desert location george et al 2017a the seed yield of canola showed a positive relationship with both seasonal water supply and total water uptake whereas camelina showed a more weakly positive relationship figs 1 and 2 the relationship between yield and seasonal water use for canola proposed by robertson and kirkegaard 2005 for an equiseasonal rainfall environment with a seasonal water use efficiency of approximately 11kg ha mm above 120mm to a limit of 450mm is similar to the upper boundary of the data for canola in fig 1 based on the figures the seasonal water supply that maximized canola seed yields was approximately 500 600mm the threshold yield for canola to be economically competitive with wheat in california is approximately 3000kg ha winans et al 2016 which would require a seasonal water availability of approximately 400mm if supplemental irrigation is needed due to dry periods or dry years or if the species are produced in the low rainfall southern central valley our findings suggest the irrigation needs of canola will be very similar to other cool season crops grown in the region such as wheat dwr 2015 jackson et al 2006 the upper boundary visually fitted to the camelina data suggests a seasonal water use efficiency of approximately 8kg ha mm above 90mm with a maximum yield of 3000kg ha for a seasonal water supply of 500mm the mean maximum yields observed in california to date are more typically 1000 2000kg ha for camelina george et al 2017a kaffka et al 2015 and predicted water requirements corresponding to commonly observed yields are 250 300mm a seasonal water supply from all sources of approximately 300mm is available in most years throughout extensive areas of the state therefore total plant available water may not be an important determinant of yield for camelina in california the trend lines for the two species intersect at an estimated seasonal water availability of 225mm fig 1 the maximum estimated water uptake based on tdr measurements was approximately 360mm for canola and 200mm for camelina fig 2 which is lower than for the seasonal water supply evaporative losses from sprinkler and flood irrigation can amount to 25 50 of total seasonal water supply connellan 2013 the lower estimates of estimated water uptake relative to seasonal water supply here are therefore reasonable given the tdr does not account for evaporative losses from the soil surface or crop canopy the maximum water uptake efficiency is estimated to be approximately 16g mm ha for canola closer to the observed maximum in australia robertson and kirkegaard 2005 and 9g mm ha for camelina with the trend lines intersecting at approximately 100mm fig 2 the poorer relationship between seasonal water supply and yield for camelina and large numbers of data points falling below the upper boundary suggest environmental factors apart from water supply strongly influence yield the population of camelina varieties evaluated in the multi environment trial displayed cryptic genotype by environment effects yield variation could therefore not be attributed to any single environmental factor george et al 2017a seed yield being weakly related to seasonal evapotranspiration in camelina has been observed by other workers french et al 2009 hunsaker et al 2011 hunsaker et al 2013 additional work will be required on water use by canola and camelina in california s diverse production environments but the results reported here are in general agreement with those reported for both species when grown as a cool season crop in other regions amjad 2010 ccc 2015 hergert et al 2011 hu et al 2015 hunsaker et al 2013 lenssen et al 2012 mccaffery 2006 zeleke et al 2014 the close relationship between the findings of robertson and kirkegaard 2005 and zeleke et al 2014 and the results observed here suggests previously established relationships between seed yield and water use developed for spring type canola in australia are broadly applicable to spring type canola production in california camelina has a lower yield potential than canola but is regarded by some as more reliable under water limited conditions allen et al 2014 francis and campbell 2003 george et al 2017a gunasekera et al 2009 hunt and norton 2011 jiang 2013 putnam et al 1993 a number of authors have investigated the potential of camelina to produce seed at lower seasonal moisture levels than canola as well as other crops with similar planting periods chen et al 2015 hulbert et al 2012 camelina seed can germinate successfully at matric potentials of 1 5mpa while canola germinates poorly at these potentials jiang 2013 at the paso robles location in both seasons canola failed due to insufficient seasonal water but camelina yielded approximately 300kg ha george et al 2017a our results suggest camelina has a water use efficiency lower than canola but a lower minimum water requirement for germination and seed production we therefore propose that camelina will produce a seed crop and has the potential to out yield canola only at a seasonal water availability of less than approximately 200mm 3 2 temporal and spatial water use of canola and camelina and estimates of single crop coefficients temporal and spatial patterns of water use varied between locations and years examples of spatial and temporal water use in the soil profile estimated using tdr data are presented in fig 3 the figures are representative of a high yielding crop of both species and therefore show clear temporal water use patterns trends in daily evapo transpiration were broadly similar to what has been reported by other workers for both species in other regions hergert et al 2011 hunsaker et al 2013 the water use of both species was similar and relatively low for the first three months after planting november december and january and peaked during the following two months february and march this corresponds with the phenological stages of germination and rosette formation 0 80days after sowing stem elongation flowering and seed set 80 110days after sowing and seed maturation 110days after sowing for spring canola grown as a winter crop in california george et al 2017a this pattern of water use also corresponds with the phenology of camelina observed in california george et al 2017a over the first 50 100days after planting changes in the soil volumetric water content were relatively small and generally occurred at depths of 50cm or less following that period there was a rapid change in soil volumetric water content deeper in the soil profile indicating that both species had begun to draw on water at those depths this coincides with the period of increased daily evapotranspiration in both species starting in early spring changes in soil volumetric water content were usually greatest at soil depths of less than 100cm however changes at depths of over 150cm also were observed end of season soil trenches were excavated to remove the tdrs and roots of both crops were observed at depths of at least 150cm although root density was low compared with shallower soil layers this suggests both species have the ability to access soil water at or below 150cm but will preferentially utilize shallower water if it is available sites with poor growth showed lesswater use from deep in the soil profile data not shown there was a variation in estimated crop coefficients within and between sites this is to be expected given that growing conditions were sometimes suboptimal and crops were not fully irrigated allen et al 1998 when averaged across sites on a monthly basis the single crop coefficient estimates are similar to or slightly lower than those reported elsewhere for canola and camelina allen et al 1998 hunsaker et al 2013 fig 4 camelina had marginally higher crop coefficients than canola earlier in the season which we believe corresponds to the species tolerance of lower temperatures and more rapid early growth but lower values during peak water use relative to canola which corresponds with the species smaller over all leaf area and total biomass production more controlled conditions and quantitative observations of crop phenology will be needed to more exactly determine the timing of the initial mid and end season crop coefficients allen et al 1998 3 3 simulation of water use using the apsim crop model this study found there was general agreement between the apsim predictions of crop water uptake and tdr estimates of crop water uptake by canola in terms of both seasonal patterns and total water uptake fig 5 this test of the model was limited in scope and additional field studies will be required to confirm the accuracy of apsim in the region but the results suggest the model is able to estimate both temporal and total water uptake patterns of canola under cool season production conditions in california with a reasonable degree of accuracy these findings along with those of george and kaffka 2017 suggest apsim could be used within california for the following 1 understand the potential water requirements of canola relative to cereals in the cool season cropping systems of the state 2 reduce risk in water limited canola production systems by yield forecasting given initial soil water conditions and seasonal water inputs 3 identify management strategies for maximizing the water use efficiency of canola and 4 explore the viability of canola as a crop in the region under current and future rainfall and irrigation supply scenarios 4 conclusions this study explored the water use of canola and camelina as cool season crops in california using ideal agronomic management practices the seasonal water availability required to achieve economically viable yields of canola in california will be approximately 400mm camelina may be a more reliable alternative to canola when the total seasonal water supply is less than 250mm but lower seed yields and oil content may limit its adoption the mean winter precipitation throughout much of the northern central valley and near coastal dry farming regions of california should therefore be sufficient to achieve high yield potentials for both species without irrigation irrigation requirements for canola will likely be similar to or lower than wheat in the same areas observed total and temporal water use for both canola and camelina are comparable to what has been observed for the species in other regions under cool season conditions notably australia and from field trial and crop modeling data from california george et al 2017a george and kaffka 2017 research and agronomic management practices regarding water use developed in australia therefore have relevance for california acknowledgments we

11594,the agricultural sector of california is one of the most diverse and economically valuable in the world but is dominated by woody perennial and annual warm season crops dependent on irrigation these face potential problems from restrictions to irrigation water supply and climate change canola and camelina could be used to diversify cool season cropping in the state but the water use of these species in the region is poorly understood in this study both the total and temporal water use of canola and camelina under cool season production conditions in california were investigated using field based and computer modeling approaches total and temporal water use of both species were found to be similar to what has been observed in other regions under cool season conditions observed seasonal water uptake patterns also closely matched predictions by the agricultural production systems simulator apsim model these results inform the utilization of these species as new crops in california and also contribute to estimates of water use by these globally significant oilseeds under mediterranean to arid climate conditions keywords canola brassica napus camelina camelina sativa water use 1 introduction california s agricultural sector is one of the most diverse and economically valuable in the world but is dominated by woody perennial and annual warm season crops that require irrigation faostat 2015 tolomeo et al 2012 usda nass 2017 alternatives to irrigation dependent warm season annual crops are needed due to increases in competing demands for water together with projected increased variability and reduction in water supply under many climate change scenarios cayan et al 2008 cook et al 2015 jackson et al 2012 lee and six 2010 mann and gleick 2015 for example in california s central valley business as usual scenarios forecast 26 32 increases in irrigation water demand by 2099 mehta et al 2013 globally difficulties in forecasting regional rainfall and evaporation trends under climate change scenarios make predictions of future water constraints uncertain but the emerging consensus anticipates worsening water scarcity in regions that already experience dry conditions an area covering approximately 40 of the global land surface gosling and arnell 2016 ipcc 2014 schewe et al 2014 wiltshire et al 2013 one strategy to help farming in california adapt to a more water limited future is through increased use of annual cool season crops these are produced during the period of minimum evaporative demand fall to early spring and can utilize winter precipitation in the region s mediterranean to semi arid climate for some if not all of their water requirements currently the most extensively planted cool season crops in california are cereals tolomeo et al 2012 to facilitate adoption by growers new cool season crops should therefore complement or readily integrate with existing cereal production systems canola brassica napus has been used to diversify cereal based agricultural systems in multiple regions worldwide notably canada australia europe and the united states booth and gunstone 2004 duff et al 2006 pouzet 1994 usda nass 2017 suggesting it could be used as a cool season crop option in california relative to other winter oilseeds canola generally has the highest yield potential under favorable conditions but it can become unreliable when crop available water limits yield farré et al 2007 ncdc 2015 conditions that may prevail in some places and years of california the oilseed species camelina camelina sativa has lower yield potential than canola but is regarded by some as more reliable than canola under low input conditions and has a larger temperature range for crop establishment allen et al 2014 berti et al 2016 george et al 2017b jiang 2013 putnam et al 1993 and could therefore provide another winter annual alternative there is little commercial production of either canola or camelina in california at present although current studies suggest that both species have potential as crops in the region george et al 2017a winans et al 2016 the water use of both canola and camelina has been investigated but not under californian agro environmental conditions faraji et al 2009 hergert et al 2011 hocking et al 1997 hu et al 2015 hunsaker et al 2013 lenssen et al 2012 robertson and kirkegaard 2005 zeleke et al 2014 if canola and camelina are to be considered as cool season crops for adapting california agriculture to lower or more variable winter rainfall or to reduced irrigation water availability it will be necessary to develop a quantitative understanding of the water use of both species a broader understanding of the water used of canola and camelina can also assist in predicting potential yield responses and economic viability of these crops under differing scenarios of climatic variability müller and robertson 2014 as well as the potential risks and benefits of introducing crops into existing rotations for example nielsen et al 2005 thus while the work here is motivated by the potential to diversify californian winter production systems the findings have broader applicability especially given the importance of canola as the third largest vegetable oil source worldwide ers 2012 the computer crop model apsim has been used to identify crop strategies for optimizing the water use efficiency of both cereals and canola production in australia farré et al 2002 hochman et al 2009 robertson and kirkegaard 2005 apsim is a modeling framework that combines biophysical and management modules to simulate cropping systems it is used globally as a tool for both research and farm management holzworth et al 2014 keating et al 2003 the apsim canola module is used to simulate canola production in australia under both current and future climates farré et al 2007 farré et al 2002 holzworth et al 2014 kirkegaard et al 2016 kirkegaard et al 2003 luo et al 2010 mccormick et al 2015 robertson et al 1999 robertson and kirkegaard 2005 and george and kaffka 2017 recently demonstrated that the model can reliably simulate the phenology biomass accumulation and seed yields of canola production in california under a diverse range of edaphic climatic and management conditions apsim could therefore be a valuable tool for understanding and investigating the water use of canola in california and it would be worthwhile to test the accuracy of the model under californias conditions the apsim model is unable to simulate camelina at the present time here we report on work that estimated the water use of canola and camelina in california using multiple approaches the objectives of this work were to estimate the water use of canola and camelina under field conditions in relation to seed yield e g as measured by water use efficiency defined as the mass of seed production per unit area per mm water transpired to make initial estimates of crop coefficients kc that can then inform irrigation management to estimate the seasonal patterns of water use of canola and camelina and the spatial pattern of water use of both species throughout the soil profile and to use californian field data to test the ability of the apsim crop model to simulate the water use of canola 2 materials and methods 2 1 site details and seasonal weather information this work utilized data from existing multi environment yield trials of both canola and camelina that were conducted in california between 2012 and 2015 table 1 george et al 2017a seven trial sites were located to span the range of cool season cereal cropping in california and which represent all potential oilseed growing regions all sites receive almost all effective rainfall during the winter season mean seasonal rainfall volumes ranged from 80mm in the desert climate of el centro in southern california to 470mm at davis in northern california soil types at research sites were clays or loam variants notably the el centro site was situated on an arid paleolake with heavy clay soils and the tulelake site was on a recently drained lakebed with soils containing large amounts of dolomite smectitic clays and relatively high in organic matter at all locations soil fertility was non limiting for seed yield george et al 2017a suggesting the importance of variable water availability for production specific information regarding the multi environment trial sites and experimental methodology is provided by george et al 2017a all sites were managed using agronomic methods comparable to those used for commercial cereal production in the same locations production at all locations relied primarily on rainfall to meet crop water needs irrigation if available was used only if crops exhibited obvious water stress such as leaf wilting to prevent stand failure irrigation was delivered via sprinklers early in the season and then via either furrow or flood later in the season at sowing soil samples were taken from at least three locations in each field at depths of 0 50 50 100 100 150 and 150 200cm using a soil auger soil samples were used for the determination of soil volumetric water content and dry bulk density using soil volumetric water content and bulk density values the plant available volumetric water content in the total soil profile to depth of 200cm was estimated the reported maximum rooting depth of the species is approximately 200cm johnston et al 2002 and field observations made in soil profiles during this research observed negligible rooting below 150cm for either species chemical and physical analyses of soil samples to determine permanent wilting point and field capacity soil textural composition and nutrient concentrations were performed by a l western laboratories 1331 woodland ave suite 1 modesto ca 95351 as reported in table 1 weather data for the sites were obtained from the california irrigation management information system cimis 2015 the national climatic data center ncdc 2015 and from in field weather stations located at the research sites 2 2 volumetric soil water content monitoring and estimation of evapo transpiration etc at a subset of the research sites davis lockeford and west side the volumetric soil water content of the fields was measured using time domain reflectrometry tdr sensors 10hs soil moisture smart sensors and hobo u30 data loggers onset computer corporation 470 macarthur blvd bourne ma 02532 the sites were chosen because they had differing soil types davis silty clay loam clay loam lockeford loam westside clay that are nonetheless suitable for using tdrs for monitoring water content and because they are located in the central valley which is the largest contiguous cereal cropping zone of the state the tdr sensors were approximately 20cm long and installed vertically in the bottom of auger holes at approximately 10cm 50cm 100cm and 180cm below the soil surface each tdr sensor was installed in an individually augured hole spaced approximately 50cm from neighboring measurement points and in the middle of the individual crop plots the depths were selected in order to span the reported maximum rooting depth of the species 200cm johnston et al 2002 while having a higher density of measurements near the soil surface where soil water content was anticipated to be most variable two plots per species and field site were used one measured canola plot was planted to the variety hyclass 955 a short season spring type variety known to have high yield potential in california and a second was another short season spring type variety that varied by locations and year george et al 2017a for camelina one plot was planted to the variety so 50 a variety known to have superior performance in california and the other was a variety selected at random from the larger set of entries in the experimental layout george et al 2017a volumetric soil water content was logged by the tdr sensors between planting and harvest on a 15min basis wateruptake over time was estimated by depth interpolating the soil water content to a depth of 200cm and then computing the rate of change of water content per depth on a daily timescale increases in soil water content resulted from measured rainfall and irrigation and soil water depletion was attributed to evapotranspiration and deep drainage according to the mass balance 1 z i d θ i d t p i e t i q i i 1 q i 1 e t i q i i 1 here z i is the depth of soil layer i as observed at the tdr qi is the downward flow of water from layer i θ is the volumetric water content p the precipitation amount i the water application from irrigation and eti the rate of evaporation and transpiration from soil layer i total evapotranspiration is estimated by summing the estimate of eti for each soil layer water movement was assumed to be one dimensional i e negligible lateral flow a reasonable assumption given that all site slopes were 2 with deep soil profiles and deep water tables and thus no conditions to support a lateral water potential gradient the bottom profile boundary was assumed to drain freely a reasonable assumption for the deep well drained soils with unstructured soil profiles and water tables at least 10m or greater at each site characteristic of the floodplain derived soils of california s central valley nrcs 2015 two methods of estimating eti were compared which were expected to bound the true values of water uptake in the first approach all soil water depletion in the rooted profile was attributed to plant water uptake this approach likely over estimates true plant water use both because losses of water occurring due to any deep drainage are assigned to evapotranspiration and because all direct evaporation from the soil surface and plant canopy as well as transpiration losses were attributed to plant uptake in the second approach soil water depletion that occurred within two days of an irrigation or rainfall event was excluded from the estimation of plant water uptake this avoided attributing water losses from deep drainage and evaporation after rainfall to plant water use this approach likely under estimates evapotranspiration since rainfall and irrigation events were infrequent for example there were only ten rainfall events that delivered more than 10mm in a single day at davis the wettest location in both seasons the overall error introduced by this method was likely to be small because evaporation during the winter growing season in the region is relatively low cimis 2015 comparison of these two methods produced estimates that differed by only 25mm year data not presented therefore only the uncorrected data was used using these methods and assumptions total water content and the daily change in water content ascribed to plant uptake were plotted in depth time plots visualizing changes in the soil and in the plant water use profiles the mass balance approach used to estimate crop water use is subject to limitations and assumptions as discussed the water dynamics are assumed to be one dimensional i e no lateral flow the bottom boundary of the rooted profile is assumed to approximate a free drainage boundary a reasonable assumption since the depth to the water table based on information provided by individual research stations is on the order of 10m or greater at each site deep percolation other than in the period immediately after rain irrigation appeared to be minimal since only small changes in soil volumetric water content were recorded by the deepest tdrs implicitly we assume that the tdr sensors reliably capture the structure and dynamics of the subsurface water distribution the good agreement between plots supports this assumption see results nonetheless it is possible that preferential flow could cause infiltrating water to bypass individual sensors or conversely to be concentrated in the vicinity of the sensors furthermore tdr sensors are not expected to fully capture transpiration of water from near surface sources or evaporation from the soil surface or from water intercepted by the crop canopy and may therefore underestimate the evaporation portion of evapotranspiration crop water use efficiency was estimated by plotting crop water uptake against seed yield for the sample plots linear trend lines defining the upper boundary of the data were visually fitted to both species by linear regression amongst a subset of points that appeared to form an upper bound to the data see fig 1 this would represent the crop response to seasonal conditions when water is used the most efficiently due to its timing in relation to crop demand with minimal unproductive losses robertson and kirkegaard 2005 2 3 estimation of crop coefficients kc single crop coefficients kc for both canola and camelina were calculated using daily estimates of crop evapotranspiration etc and reference evapotranspiration eto from the closest cimis station using a weekly moving average and then aggregated to monthly timescales allen et al 1998 zeleke and wade 2012 the use of an averaging window reduces fluctuations induced by variable crop and reference evapotranspiration rates which otherwise propagate into large daily variations in the crop coefficient the crop phenological stages for canola used to interpret the monthly crop coefficients were based on visual field observations combined with simulations by the apsim crop model the phenological stages of camelina were based on field observations apsim 2015 george and kaffka 2017 2 4 seasonal water supply relative to yield the seasonal water supply was estimated for all sites based on the method of robertson and kirkegaard 2005 2 w p i s where w is the plant available water p is the precipitation throughout the growing season i total irrigation provided to the site s is the estimated starting soil water content in the soil profile to a depth of 200cm above the permanent wilting point for the soil considered to be the volumetric water content of the soil at matric potential of 1 5mpa the seasonal water supply for the sites was compared to the highest yielding varieties for the site as reported by george et al 2017a to establish a relationship between water supply and seed yield an upper boundary describing the maximum seasonal water use efficiency of canola described by the equation seed yield 10 6x 1243 x h2o in mm robertson and kirkegaard 2005 was compared with the seasonal water use efficiency estimated here the relationship between seasonal water supply and seed yield for camelina describing the approximate upper boundary of the camelina data was visually fitted in using the method described above 2 5 crop simulation modeling the agricultural production systems simulator apsim v 7 4 was parameterized using data from the from the davis lockeford and west side locations as reported in george and kaffka 2017 for each location apsim is a modular biophysical simulation model suitable for evaluating economic and environmental outcomes associated with crop production apsim contains separate simulation modules addressing plant soil and crop management which can be specified for different climate soil crop and variety conditions once suitably parameterized and validated for given crop soil climate combinations it can be used as a decision support for growers as well as a regional or production system level research tool apsim is extensively documented online at http www apsim info documentation aspx most relevant to this study is the soilwat module in apsim which controls soil water redistribution and usage soilwat discretizes a soil column into a series of layers eitzinger et al 2004 water content in each layer is bounded by a lower limit corresponding to wilting point and saturation during a rainfall event surface runoff is computed using the soil conservation service curve number method mishra and singh 2013 the remaining rainfall volume infiltrates into the upper soil layer and the water content in this layer is updated if the resulting water content is less than the upper limit equivalent to field capacity no further water distribution occurs if the updated water content exceeds the upper limit the remaining water drains to the next soil layer at a specified rate approximated by the saturated hydraulic conductivity unsaturated water redistribution also occurs when soil water content lies between the lower and upper limits and is specified by the soil water diffusivity water is removed from the surface soil layer by bare soil evaporation which occurs following a well known two stage model ritchie 1972 and by plant water uptake plant water uptake is determined by a plant specific factor and the difference between the volumetric soil water content in a given layer and a crop specific minimum volumetric soil water content for water uptake the climate module of apsim was initialized using inputs of maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation and rainfall obtained from the california irrigation management information system cimis 2015 from weather stations at each site generic soil types from the apsim database corresponding to conditions at each site were used and modified according to measured values for soil bulk density starting volumetric water content measured permanent wilting point volumetric water content of the soil at matric potential of 1 5mpa drained upper limit volumetric water content of the soil at matric potential of 0 3mpa nitrogen nitrate content and percent organic matter from field sites table 1 the management module of apsim was initialized using the agronomic management of canola crops at the individual research sites george et al 2017a the cumulative crop water uptake at the sites predicted by apsim was compared with the water uptake estimate generated use the tdr data 3 results and discussion 3 1 water uptake of canola and camelina in relation to yield a range of crop yields were observed during the study individual plot yields varied from stand failure to 2000kg ha for camelina and from 900 to 4800kg ha for canola and span the range of yields that can be commonly expected for camelina and canola in california george et al 2017a george and kaffka 2017 the yield variation between sites is attributed to the amount and timing of both rainfall and periods of low or high temperature george et al 2017a for example unusually cold and dry conditions during the 2013 14 season resulted in very poor stand establishment and survival for both species at the west side location and late season heat stress is believed to have depressed yields in el centro a desert location george et al 2017a the seed yield of canola showed a positive relationship with both seasonal water supply and total water uptake whereas camelina showed a more weakly positive relationship figs 1 and 2 the relationship between yield and seasonal water use for canola proposed by robertson and kirkegaard 2005 for an equiseasonal rainfall environment with a seasonal water use efficiency of approximately 11kg ha mm above 120mm to a limit of 450mm is similar to the upper boundary of the data for canola in fig 1 based on the figures the seasonal water supply that maximized canola seed yields was approximately 500 600mm the threshold yield for canola to be economically competitive with wheat in california is approximately 3000kg ha winans et al 2016 which would require a seasonal water availability of approximately 400mm if supplemental irrigation is needed due to dry periods or dry years or if the species are produced in the low rainfall southern central valley our findings suggest the irrigation needs of canola will be very similar to other cool season crops grown in the region such as wheat dwr 2015 jackson et al 2006 the upper boundary visually fitted to the camelina data suggests a seasonal water use efficiency of approximately 8kg ha mm above 90mm with a maximum yield of 3000kg ha for a seasonal water supply of 500mm the mean maximum yields observed in california to date are more typically 1000 2000kg ha for camelina george et al 2017a kaffka et al 2015 and predicted water requirements corresponding to commonly observed yields are 250 300mm a seasonal water supply from all sources of approximately 300mm is available in most years throughout extensive areas of the state therefore total plant available water may not be an important determinant of yield for camelina in california the trend lines for the two species intersect at an estimated seasonal water availability of 225mm fig 1 the maximum estimated water uptake based on tdr measurements was approximately 360mm for canola and 200mm for camelina fig 2 which is lower than for the seasonal water supply evaporative losses from sprinkler and flood irrigation can amount to 25 50 of total seasonal water supply connellan 2013 the lower estimates of estimated water uptake relative to seasonal water supply here are therefore reasonable given the tdr does not account for evaporative losses from the soil surface or crop canopy the maximum water uptake efficiency is estimated to be approximately 16g mm ha for canola closer to the observed maximum in australia robertson and kirkegaard 2005 and 9g mm ha for camelina with the trend lines intersecting at approximately 100mm fig 2 the poorer relationship between seasonal water supply and yield for camelina and large numbers of data points falling below the upper boundary suggest environmental factors apart from water supply strongly influence yield the population of camelina varieties evaluated in the multi environment trial displayed cryptic genotype by environment effects yield variation could therefore not be attributed to any single environmental factor george et al 2017a seed yield being weakly related to seasonal evapotranspiration in camelina has been observed by other workers french et al 2009 hunsaker et al 2011 hunsaker et al 2013 additional work will be required on water use by canola and camelina in california s diverse production environments but the results reported here are in general agreement with those reported for both species when grown as a cool season crop in other regions amjad 2010 ccc 2015 hergert et al 2011 hu et al 2015 hunsaker et al 2013 lenssen et al 2012 mccaffery 2006 zeleke et al 2014 the close relationship between the findings of robertson and kirkegaard 2005 and zeleke et al 2014 and the results observed here suggests previously established relationships between seed yield and water use developed for spring type canola in australia are broadly applicable to spring type canola production in california camelina has a lower yield potential than canola but is regarded by some as more reliable under water limited conditions allen et al 2014 francis and campbell 2003 george et al 2017a gunasekera et al 2009 hunt and norton 2011 jiang 2013 putnam et al 1993 a number of authors have investigated the potential of camelina to produce seed at lower seasonal moisture levels than canola as well as other crops with similar planting periods chen et al 2015 hulbert et al 2012 camelina seed can germinate successfully at matric potentials of 1 5mpa while canola germinates poorly at these potentials jiang 2013 at the paso robles location in both seasons canola failed due to insufficient seasonal water but camelina yielded approximately 300kg ha george et al 2017a our results suggest camelina has a water use efficiency lower than canola but a lower minimum water requirement for germination and seed production we therefore propose that camelina will produce a seed crop and has the potential to out yield canola only at a seasonal water availability of less than approximately 200mm 3 2 temporal and spatial water use of canola and camelina and estimates of single crop coefficients temporal and spatial patterns of water use varied between locations and years examples of spatial and temporal water use in the soil profile estimated using tdr data are presented in fig 3 the figures are representative of a high yielding crop of both species and therefore show clear temporal water use patterns trends in daily evapo transpiration were broadly similar to what has been reported by other workers for both species in other regions hergert et al 2011 hunsaker et al 2013 the water use of both species was similar and relatively low for the first three months after planting november december and january and peaked during the following two months february and march this corresponds with the phenological stages of germination and rosette formation 0 80days after sowing stem elongation flowering and seed set 80 110days after sowing and seed maturation 110days after sowing for spring canola grown as a winter crop in california george et al 2017a this pattern of water use also corresponds with the phenology of camelina observed in california george et al 2017a over the first 50 100days after planting changes in the soil volumetric water content were relatively small and generally occurred at depths of 50cm or less following that period there was a rapid change in soil volumetric water content deeper in the soil profile indicating that both species had begun to draw on water at those depths this coincides with the period of increased daily evapotranspiration in both species starting in early spring changes in soil volumetric water content were usually greatest at soil depths of less than 100cm however changes at depths of over 150cm also were observed end of season soil trenches were excavated to remove the tdrs and roots of both crops were observed at depths of at least 150cm although root density was low compared with shallower soil layers this suggests both species have the ability to access soil water at or below 150cm but will preferentially utilize shallower water if it is available sites with poor growth showed lesswater use from deep in the soil profile data not shown there was a variation in estimated crop coefficients within and between sites this is to be expected given that growing conditions were sometimes suboptimal and crops were not fully irrigated allen et al 1998 when averaged across sites on a monthly basis the single crop coefficient estimates are similar to or slightly lower than those reported elsewhere for canola and camelina allen et al 1998 hunsaker et al 2013 fig 4 camelina had marginally higher crop coefficients than canola earlier in the season which we believe corresponds to the species tolerance of lower temperatures and more rapid early growth but lower values during peak water use relative to canola which corresponds with the species smaller over all leaf area and total biomass production more controlled conditions and quantitative observations of crop phenology will be needed to more exactly determine the timing of the initial mid and end season crop coefficients allen et al 1998 3 3 simulation of water use using the apsim crop model this study found there was general agreement between the apsim predictions of crop water uptake and tdr estimates of crop water uptake by canola in terms of both seasonal patterns and total water uptake fig 5 this test of the model was limited in scope and additional field studies will be required to confirm the accuracy of apsim in the region but the results suggest the model is able to estimate both temporal and total water uptake patterns of canola under cool season production conditions in california with a reasonable degree of accuracy these findings along with those of george and kaffka 2017 suggest apsim could be used within california for the following 1 understand the potential water requirements of canola relative to cereals in the cool season cropping systems of the state 2 reduce risk in water limited canola production systems by yield forecasting given initial soil water conditions and seasonal water inputs 3 identify management strategies for maximizing the water use efficiency of canola and 4 explore the viability of canola as a crop in the region under current and future rainfall and irrigation supply scenarios 4 conclusions this study explored the water use of canola and camelina as cool season crops in california using ideal agronomic management practices the seasonal water availability required to achieve economically viable yields of canola in california will be approximately 400mm camelina may be a more reliable alternative to canola when the total seasonal water supply is less than 250mm but lower seed yields and oil content may limit its adoption the mean winter precipitation throughout much of the northern central valley and near coastal dry farming regions of california should therefore be sufficient to achieve high yield potentials for both species without irrigation irrigation requirements for canola will likely be similar to or lower than wheat in the same areas observed total and temporal water use for both canola and camelina are comparable to what has been observed for the species in other regions under cool season conditions notably australia and from field trial and crop modeling data from california george et al 2017a george and kaffka 2017 research and agronomic management practices regarding water use developed in australia therefore have relevance for california acknowledgments we
