wastewater has been the largest proportion of antibiotic wastewater production for many years the components of the penicillin wastewater include sugars proteins nh4 n residual penicillin non bioavailable macromolecular organic substances and high concentration sulfate the wastewater is characterized by the residual antibiotics and high concentration sulfate which can affect the osmotic

once it is released into the environment therefore penicillin wastewater must be properly treated before being discharged into the receiving water body 8 previous researches point out that the

process in mbr can effectively retain sludge floc and dispersed microorganism which may be beneficial to enhance the enrichment of drug resistant microorganism 16 promote the development of rich microbial communities and enrich the function of biodegrading target pollutants 17 thus mbr has potential to remove residual penicillin in wastewater and mitigate their possible effects on humans and environment 18 21 meantime mbr may be accompanied by the accumulation of organic and inorganic compounds that are difficult to biodegrade in the bioreactor 22 removal efficiency and membrane fouling have always been the focus of attention in mbr treating pharmaceutical wastewater shi et al 23 used a sequencing batch anaerobic aerobic process to treat pharmaceutical wastewater with high salinity as a post treatment process the mbr showed excellent removal efficiency of organic and nitrification chen et al 24 conducted a pilot test using a two phase anaerobic digestion system and mbr post treatment to treat chemically synthesize pharmaceutical wastewater and finally the effluent can be discharged directly xiao et al 25 studied the removal of five drug compounds in synthetic antibiotic wastewater using the anaerobic mbr they found that the difference in antibiotic removal efficiency was mainly related to the types of antibiotics under the same treatment conditions wen et al 26 designed a laboratory scale anoxic aerobic mbr for the treatment of antibiotic wastewater containing different concentrations of antibiotics the removal effect of cod and nh4 n was very fine the results showed that the difference in antibiotic removal efficiency was due to different main removal routes including strong hydrolysis biodegradation and adsorption huang et al 21 used anaerobic mbr to treat actual β lactam antibiotics pharmaceutical wastewater they found that the removal of the same class of antibiotics would also vary greatly hamon et al 27 selected the mbr to treat tumor ward wastewater to study the removal of several drug molecules they concluded that membrane fouling increased the removal effect of the drug li et al 28 focused on the effects of carbamazepine to membrane fouling they reported that carbamazepine induced a significant increase in 10 100 kda protein content in smp leading to more serious membrane fouling effect of the characteristic pollutant salts in pharmaceutical wastewater on mbr performance has also been worthy of attention from a phenomenological point of view salinity will affect the physicochemical parameters and biological activity of activated sludge thus affecting the pollutants removal efficiency of mbr 29 song et al 5 found that increasing the sodium chloride concentration in the influent had a negative impact on the performance of anaerobic mbr in the wastewater treatment zhang et al 30 found that the addition of calcium salt reduced the recovery time and fouling rate of mbr by 50 and 34 respectively in terms of biological flocculation salt impact had caused significant changes in sludge properties such as larger particle size higher relative hydrophobicity and zeta potential lower polysaccharide content in supernatant and higher protein polysaccharide pn ps ratio in eps wei et al 31 used nanofiltration membrane for advanced treatment of complex pharmaceutical wastewater they found that the deposition of calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate was the main cause of membrane pollution in the initial stage of nanofiltration process the interaction of inorganic ions organic matters and the membrane surface accelerated the deposition of organic matters on the membrane surface thus increasing membrane fouling in the previous study the effect of sulfate on the performance of aerobic mbr for the treatment of penicillin wastewater has not been reported nevertheless sulfate is a characteristic pollutant to be considered in the treatment of penicillin wastewater in this preliminary study comparative experiments were carried out to explore effects of the sulfate on the activated sludge and membrane fouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and materials mbr structure and flat sheet membrane were consistent with our previous study 32 the membrane used in the experiment was sinap 10 polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf flat membrane shanghai sinap membrane separation technology co ltd china with 0 1 μm average membrane pore size two mbrs called r1 and r2 were operated in parallel r1 treated the influent containing penicillin while the influent of r2 contained both penicillin and sulfate table 1 listed the composition and concentration of synthetic wastewater quality of the synthetic wastewater was presented in table 2 the relative ratio of cod nh4 n po4 3 p was 634 24 5 13 7 sodium bicarbonate was used as a buffer to maintain a constant ph and to support nitrification benzylpenicillin sodium for injection national drug standard h13020655 1 6 million units specification huabei pharmaceutical co ltd was introduced into the synthetic wastewater to form penicillin wastewater at a concentration of 4 mg l usually the raw wastewater is pre treated and diluted before entering the biological treatment system of pharmaceutical industry therefore the concentration of influent pollutants in mbr post treatment is far lower than that of the penicillin production wastewater 17 ng et al 10 reported that the concentration of so4 2 in weak stream was about 43 11 mg l and the concentration of so4 2 in strong stream is about 226 63 mg l therefore sodium sulfate analytical grade was used as the sulfate in this preliminary study and the concentration of sulfate in penicillin wastewater was 45 mg l according to the previous studies mbrs treating saline wastewater should be operated at a lower flux in order to prolong the hydraulic retention time hrt and improve the biodegradation in addition the detailed changes in activated sludge performance and membrane fouling can be observed and analyzed accurately at lower membrane fluxes ng et al 12 compared a novel bio entrapped salt marsh sedimentary membrane reactor with conventional mbrs for treating high salinity pharmaceutical wastewater and the fouling behavior under different membrane flux of 0 73 1 46 2 19 l h m2 was assessed jang et al 33 used a laboratory scale mbr to treat synthetic high salt wastewater and investigate the effects of high salinity on the performance and membrane fouling of mbr with a membrane flux of 3 5 l h m2 johir et al 34 investigated the effect of salt concentration on organic and ammonia removal by a laboratory scale mbr operated at a low flux of 2 5 l h m2 yu et al 35 used a 10 l hybrid mbr to treat high salt wastewater and studied the behavior of eps and smp as functions of operating time salinity and backflow ratio at the flux of 5 l h m2 in this preliminary study efficient volume of the bioreactor in each mbr was 8 l and the hrts were controlled at 13 h therefore the corresponding membrane flux in this study was 6 15 l h m2 the initial mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of sludge mixture in bioreactors were 7 6 g l the ratios of food to microorganism f m in mbrs were 0 11 kgcod kgmlss d which was consistent with the studies conducted by siembida et al 36 and shi et al 37 when the f m were 0 11 and 0 06 kgcod kgmlss d siembida et al carried out two pilot mbrs treating synthetic and real wastewater to research fouling reduction and permeability loss 36 shi et al used a hollow fiber mbr treating low concentration sulfamethazine contained wastewater to improve the sulfamethazine biodegrading microorganisms as well as sulfamethazine biodegradation long hrts were maintained by adjusting the permeation fluxes of the mbr system between 1 1 and 2 2 lmh and the corresponding f m was 0 10 kgcod kgmlss d 37 at least some variables of the operational parameters in the complex array of a mbr process can be fixed at a constant value so a laboratory scale study is the only way to assess the system performance although the results of a laboratory scale mbr can be different from that of a proto scale mbr plant 38 39 during the whole experiment no excess sludge was discharged except for analysis flow rate of the continuous aeration was maintained at 0 4 m3 h to provide dissolved oxygen for the biomass growth and remove particles deposited on the membrane surface compared with the online backwash of commercial mbr this work was performed in an intermittent mode since intermittent operation could improve the membrane fouling peristaltic pump drawing effluent was set to 7 min of filtration time and 3 min of relaxation time 2 2 methods of analysis salinity has different effects on cod removal due to the characteristics of influent and the differences in mbr devices 29 in order to characterize the effect of sulfate on treatment performance the removal rates of cod and nh4 n were calculated according to the following formula 1 3 cod and nh4 n were determined by spectrometric method with spectrophotometer dr890 hach company united states of america 1 rtotal cinf ceff cinf 100 2 rbio cinf csup cinf 100 3 rmem csup ceff cinf 100 where rtotal rbio and rmem were total removal rate membrane retention removal rate and biological removal rate and cinf csup and ceff refered to the concentration of pollutants in influent supernatant and effluent sulfate may affect the characteristics of activated sludge in mbr treating penicillin wastewater thus mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss soluble microbial products smp extracellular polymeric substances eps and microbial species were determined mlss and mlvss were measured according to the method described in the literature 40 smp and eps were characterized by the sum of ps and pn concentrations the analysis method for ps and pn were anthrone methods and coomassie brilliant blue colorimetry 41 respectively an electron microscope scope a1 zeiss germany was used to observe the microbial size and species the floc particle size in the sludge mixture was detected by the particle size analyzer bt800s liaoning dandong baxter instruments co ltd china sludge volume sv tmp scanning electron microscopy sem resistance distribution and fouling contribution were characterized to explore the effect of sulfate on membrane fouling total resistance of the membrane filtration included inherent resistance of membrane rm cake layer resistance rc pore blocking resistance rp and irreversible resistance ri resistance distribution was calculated based on the previous method 42 43 the methods for the other parameters test were consistent with our previous study 44 on the 60th day of mbr operation a certain amount of sludge mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes to separate suspended solids and supernatant the supernatant was flocculated with 250 mg l al2 so4 3 and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min to obtain colloid and solute a 0 45 μm pvdf circular membrane was placed between the glass sand core filters by adjusting the glass rotor flowmeter the pressure gauge of the vacuum pump was kept constant during the suction filtration process and the time required for the quantitative fluid to flow through the membrane under constant pressure was recorded the fluid resistance was calculated according to the darcy s law formula 4 specific calculation of fluid resistance of each part were calculated according to the following formula 5 6 45 46 4 r δp j μ where r δp j μ were filtration resistance m 1 tmp kpa membrane flux m3 m2 s and the viscosity pa s of the permeate respectively 5 rt rm rss rsup 6 rsup rcol rsol where rt and rm were the total resistance and the inherent resistance of the new membrane respectively and rss rsup rsol rcol refered to the resistance of suspended solid supernatant solute and colloid 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal performance of cod and nh4 n fig 1 and table 3 show the cod concentration and the removal rate as a function of operation time respectively fig 1 exhibits both mbrs had high cod removal efficiency and the average cod in effluent was lower than 50 mg l in addition the pathway of cod removal mainly relied on biodegradation table 3 and membrane retention had a positive effect on stabilizing the effluent quality table 3 shows sulfate had a negative effect on the biological removal of cod compared to fig 1 a the changes of supernatant cod in fig 1 b illustrated that the negative effect occurred in the early stages of operation the supernatant cod gradually decreased and stabilized at the end of the operation indicating that the microorganisms gradually adapted to the sulfate environment fig 2 shows that both mbrs had high removal performance for nh4 n and the removal pathway of nh4 n was dominated by biodegradation this result was consistent with the cod removal similarly the changes of supernatant nh4 n indicated sulfate affected the biological removal of nh4 n the sulfate in bioreactor deteriorated the activity of nitrifying microorganisms and was not conducive to nh4 n removal in the early stage of operation however the nitrification activity was restored when slow growing and sensitive nitrifying microorganism gradually adapted to the sulfate environment in the later stages of operation 47 3 2 effects of sulfate on characteristics of activated sludge in mbr 3 2 1 mlss mlvss and ratio the ratio of mlvss to mlss mlvss mlss is a common index to evaluate sludge activity 48 fig 3 shows sulfate promoted the increase of mlss and mlvss concentrations in r2 during the experimental operation but the mlvss mlss of r2 was 0 8 lower than the value of 0 86 in r1 by calculating the average value these results were partially consistent with the results of song et al 5 they found that the sodium chloride concentration in the influent of the anaerobic mbr gradually increased and the mlss concentration increased while the mlvss concentration decreased significantly and the mlvss mlss decreased this observation could be attributed to the negative effects on the bioactivity of anaerobic digesters 5 however song et al 49 obtained different results in another experiment they found the influent sulfate content increased to 600 mg l during the anaerobic mbr operation without significantly affecting the biomass concentration the stable concentrations of mlss and mlvss indicated that adding sulfate to the influent did not cause an increase in the inorganic components of mlss the reasons for the different results might be due to the difference in influent characteristics and reactor types the higher mlss and mlvss concentration in r2 should theoretically promote microbial degradation performance but the lower mlvss mlss indicated that inhibition of microbial activity caused by sulfate reducing the cod and nh4 n removal in section 3 1 mlvss contains active microorganisms and other organic matter the increase in mlvss concentration do not mean that the concentration of active microorganisms is high and the degradation performance is excellent therefore activated sludge metabolites were compared in the later experiments 3 2 2 comparison of floc particle sizes in the process of membrane filtration smaller activated sludge can easily affect the membrane 50 the tendency of small particles to adhere to the membrane surface is higher than larger particles the fouling contribution of each component in the bioreactor depends on the particle size as both permeation drag and back transport velocity are particle size related functions 51 fig 4 shows the particle size distribution of sludge mixed liquor in mbrs on the 60th day of mbr operation the diff lines in the particle size distribution map refer to the percentage content of the particle size and the cumu lines refer to the cumulant of the percentage content of all particles before a certain particle size the median diameter d50 refers to the sludge particle size corresponding to the cumu line when the cumulative particle size content is 50 compared with the median diameter d50 of sludge mixture 90 17 μm in r2 was lower than the value 112 6 μm in r1 the result indicated that the addition of sulfate reduced the floc particle size salinity shock could cause the death of microbial cells or partial disintegration of sludge flocs 52 similarly raynaud et al 53 found that adding sodium chloride to activated sludge caused the release of fine particles which were believed to clog the filter media the reduction in particle size will increase the membrane pore blockage thereby increasing membrane fouling 3 2 3 comparison of activated sludge metabolites comparing fig 5 a the total amount of eps extracted by sludge in r2 fig 5 b was higher than that in r1 indicating that the number of inactive microorganisms in r2 was large in addition the hydrophobicity of activated sludge in r2 was increased compared to r1 relying on pn ps in eps 54 the increase in sludge hydrophobicity could decrease zeta potential and result in irregular floc shape of sludge 55 as shown in fig 6 the total amount of smp and the pn ps in r2 were higher than the values in r1 this result supported the conclusion that smp was the dissolved eps 56 combining the results in section 3 2 1 the higher concentrations of eps and smp were attributed to the high concentration of suspended biomass which might provide more growth and biomass attenuation opportunities for eps and smp to be released from substrate metabolism into solution 12 this factor also led to the increase of inactive biomass in sludge mixed liquor suspended solids higher smp was one of the factors increasing the cod concentration in the r2 supernatant moreover higher smp could increase the viscosity of the sludge mixture accelerate the formation of the gel layer and aggravate the deposition of the cake layer 57 3 2 4 microbial community analysis the coordination of different microorganisms is considered to be the important removal mechanism of organic pollutants in mbrs 58 comparing fig 8 with fig 7 it can be seen that the presence of sulfate also affected the species of microorganism community in addition to altering the sludge activity in the mbrs during the operation of r1 the characteristic microorganisms in activated sludge were mainly rotifer stenoptera epistylis paramecium and rotifer fig 7 the small amount of paramecium and the presence of epistylis indicated that activated sludge was in favorable condition in r1 the characteristic microorganisms of activated sludge were mainly rotifer stenoptera nematode clock worm and actinomycete one kind of filamentous microorganism during the r2 operation fig 8 the emergence of free living nematodes implied that the purification degree in biological treatment was not ideal higher mlss and relatively insufficient dissolved oxygen might be the important reasons causing the presence of rotted nematodes and smaller vorticella in r2 excessive growth and propagation of filamentous microorganism could increase the viscosity of sludge mixture and deteriorate the sludge sedimentation performance 3 3 effect of sulfate on membrane fouling in mbr 3 3 1 difference of sludge sedimentation performance the above analysis results of eps smp and pn ps indicated that sulfate affected microbial metabolism coupled with the increase in sludge concentration and the decrease in sludge particle size a large amount of flocs might be dispersed 45 50 59 therefore the sedimentation of activated sludge in r2 might be deteriorated fig 9 shows the changes of sedimentation of activated sludge with time in mbrs as can be seen from fig 9 penicillin and sulfate could both caused the increase in sv value of activated sludge due to the inhibition of microbial activity during the early operation of the mbrs however the sv of r1 stabilized at about 28 in the later stage of operation indicating that the activated sludge gradually adapted to the penicillin wastewater a significant difference from r1 was that the sv of r2 continued to increase until it approached 100 indicating that sulfate had a more serious impact on activated sludge than penicillin 3 3 2 tmp evolution in r1 and r2 poor performance of sludge sedimentation will increase the diffusion rate of sludge flocs to the membrane surface thereby may promote the occurrence and development of membrane fouling fig 10 characterizes membrane fouling by tmp as a function of operation time the growth rate of tmp in r2 was faster than that in r1 which indicated that the membrane filtration performance of sludge mixture in r2 was poor the tmp value reached 20 kpa was on the 48th day in r1 and was on the 28th day in r2 this result implied that the sulfate shortened the operating time of the mbr by about 40 the reason might be attributed to the fact that more colloids blocked the pores of the membrane and fine sludge flocs deposited on the membrane surface in r2 therefore sem of fouled membrane resistance distribution of membrane filtration and contribution of sludge fractions to fouling were analyzed in subsequent experiments 3 3 3 sem of fouled membrane and resistance distribution fig 11 a and d show that the membrane surfaces were deposited by the cake layer and the membrane pores were completely covered in the mbrs at the end of operation in particular the fouled membrane surface was smoother and denser in r2 comparing the membrane cross sections of fig 10 b and e it can be found that the cross section thickness of the fouled membrane in r2 320 81 μm was significantly higher than that in r1 109 06 μm from the morphology of the membrane pores after the physical and chemical cleaning showed in fig 11 c and f it can be seen that the profile of membrane pore in r1 was clearer than that in r2 table 4 illustrates the resistance distribution of membrane filtration in mbrs was dominated by the cake layer resistance rc the cake layer on the membrane surface was the main factor causing membrane fouling in long term operation 60 due to the large amount of eps and smp produced in r2 the colloids and solutes of sludge mixture adsorbed deposited and blocked the membrane pores more severely ultimately exhibiting the higher pore blocking resistance rp and the higher irreversible resistance ri severe membrane pore blockage could accelerate the formation and development of cake layer 61 62 zhou et al had reported that filamentous microbes 5 10 μm associated with micro particles resulted in higher filter cake fouling resistance and free living cells in the form of colloidal particles 0 45 1 μm caused more severe pores blockage 63 combined with the above results it can be concluded that sulfate changed the characteristics of activated sludge and thus caused the difference in membrane fouling degree 3 3 4 contribution of sludge fractions to membrane fouling the increase in sludge concentration and metabolic products and the decrease of sludge activity and particle size resulted in the increase of membrane resistance 64 table 5 illustrates that rt value of r2 was 21 40 1010 m 1 significantly higher than 6 49 1010 m 1 in r1 moreover the main fouling contributor in sludge mixture changed from suspended solids 48 84 in r1 to colloids 59 21 in r2 due to the effect of sulfate the results in the aforementioned section showed that sulfate inhibited microbial activity and released colloidal eps resulting in severe membrane pore blockage and dense cake layer in r2 therefore rss and rcol showed a dramatic development in r2 compared to r1 rsol increased from 1 08 1010 m 1 in r1 to 2 89 1010 m 1 in r2 indicating that the increase of ri was also related to the adsorption crystallization and precipitation of solute in the pores of the membrane 4 conclusions in order to explore the effects of sulfate on activated sludge characteristics and membrane fouling in mbr treating penicillin wastewater comparative experiments were carried out in this paper mbr exhibited higher performance in the removal of cod and nh4 n where biodegradation was the primary removal mechanism for pollutants and membrane retention had a positive effect on stabilizing the effluent quality sulfate had a negative impact on the biodegradation of cod and nh4 n in the early stages of mbr operation the lower mlvss mlss indicated that inhibition of microbial activity was one of the important reasons for the reduction of pollutants treatment performance in addition larger pn ps in the eps and higher smp resulted in the reduction in the sludge sedimentation performance and the increase in the supernatant cod by affecting the hydrophobicity of the sludge flocs and the viscosity of the sludge mixture the long term presence of sulfate altered the microbial species and the filamentous microorganism therein could also deteriorate the filterability of the sludge mixture tmp evolution showed that the sulfate shortened the operating time of the mbr by about 40 the results of the resistance distribution and the fouling contribution proved that the resistance generated by severe membrane pore blockage and dense cake layer which was mainly derived from the colloidal component in the sludge mixture the results of this paper suggest that desalting pretreatment should be considered and salt tolerant activated sludge should be cultured and acclimated when mbr was used to treat penicillin wastewater declaration

a constant value so a laboratory scale study is the only way to assess the system performance although the results of a laboratory scale mbr can be different from that of a proto scale mbr plant 38 39 during the whole experiment no excess sludge was discharged except for analysis flow rate of the continuous aeration was maintained at 0 4 m3 h to provide dissolved oxygen for the biomass growth and remove particles deposited on the membrane surface compared with the online backwash of commercial mbr this work was performed in an intermittent mode since intermittent operation could improve the membrane fouling peristaltic pump drawing effluent was set to 7 min of filtration time and 3 min of relaxation time 2 2 methods of analysis salinity has different effects on cod removal due to the characteristics of influent and the differences in mbr devices 29 in order to characterize the effect of sulfate on treatment performance the removal rates of cod and nh4 n were calculated according to the following formula 1 3 cod and nh4 n were determined by spectrometric method with spectrophotometer dr890 hach company united states of america 1 rtotal cinf ceff cinf 100 2 rbio cinf csup cinf 100 3 rmem csup ceff cinf 100 where rtotal rbio and rmem were total removal rate membrane retention removal rate and biological removal rate and cinf csup and ceff refered to the concentration of pollutants in influent supernatant and effluent sulfate may affect the characteristics of activated sludge in mbr treating penicillin wastewater thus mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss soluble microbial products smp extracellular polymeric substances eps and microbial species were determined mlss and mlvss were measured according to the method described in the literature 40 smp and eps were characterized by the sum of ps and pn concentrations the analysis method for ps and pn were anthrone methods and coomassie brilliant blue colorimetry 41 respectively an electron microscope scope a1 zeiss germany was used to observe the microbial size and species the floc particle size in the sludge mixture was detected by the particle size analyzer bt800s liaoning dandong baxter instruments co ltd china sludge volume sv tmp scanning electron microscopy sem resistance distribution and fouling contribution were characterized to explore the effect of sulfate on membrane fouling total resistance of the membrane filtration included inherent resistance of membrane rm cake layer resistance rc pore blocking resistance rp and irreversible resistance ri resistance distribution was calculated based on the previous method 42 43 the methods for the other parameters test were consistent with our previous study 44 on the 60th day of mbr operation a certain amount of sludge mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes to separate suspended solids and supernatant the supernatant was flocculated with 250 mg l al2 so4 3 and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min to obtain colloid and solute a 0 45 μm pvdf circular membrane was placed between the glass sand core filters by adjusting the glass rotor flowmeter the pressure gauge of the vacuum pump was kept constant during the suction filtration process and the time required for the quantitative fluid to flow through the membrane under constant pressure was recorded the fluid resistance was calculated according to the darcy s law formula 4 specific calculation of fluid resistance of each part were calculated according to the following formula 5 6 45 46 4 r δp j μ where r δp j μ were filtration resistance m 1 tmp kpa membrane flux m3 m2 s and the viscosity pa s of the permeate respectively 5 rt rm rss rsup 6 rsup rcol rsol where rt and rm were the total resistance and the inherent resistance of the new membrane respectively and rss rsup rsol rcol refered to the resistance of suspended solid supernatant solute and colloid 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal performance of cod and nh4 n fig 1 and table 3 show the cod concentration and the removal rate as a function of operation time respectively fig 1 exhibits both mbrs had high cod removal efficiency and the average cod in effluent was lower than 50 mg l in addition the pathway of cod removal mainly relied on biodegradation table 3 and membrane retention had a positive effect on stabilizing the effluent quality table 3 shows sulfate had a negative effect on the biological removal of cod compared to fig 1 a the changes of supernatant cod in fig 1 b illustrated that the negative effect occurred in the early stages of operation the supernatant cod gradually decreased and stabilized at the end of the operation indicating that the microorganisms gradually adapted to the sulfate environment fig 2 shows that both mbrs had high removal performance for nh4 n and the removal pathway of nh4 n was dominated by biodegradation this result was consistent with the cod removal similarly the changes of supernatant nh4 n indicated sulfate affected the biological removal of nh4 n the sulfate in bioreactor deteriorated the activity of nitrifying microorganisms and was not conducive to nh4 n removal in the early stage of operation however the nitrification activity was restored when slow growing and sensitive nitrifying microorganism gradually adapted to the sulfate environment in the later stages of operation 47 3 2 effects of sulfate on characteristics of activated sludge in mbr 3 2 1 mlss mlvss and ratio the ratio of mlvss to mlss mlvss mlss is a common index to evaluate sludge activity 48 fig 3 shows sulfate promoted the increase of mlss and mlvss concentrations in r2 during the experimental operation but the mlvss mlss of r2 was 0 8 lower than the value of 0 86 in r1 by calculating the average value these results were partially consistent with the results of song et al 5 they found that the sodium chloride concentration in the influent of the anaerobic mbr gradually increased and the mlss concentration increased while the mlvss concentration decreased significantly and the mlvss mlss decreased this observation could be attributed to the negative effects on the bioactivity of anaerobic digesters 5 however song et al 49 obtained different results in another experiment they found the influent sulfate content increased to 600 mg l during the anaerobic mbr operation without significantly affecting the biomass concentration the stable concentrations of mlss and mlvss indicated that adding sulfate to the influent did not cause an increase in the inorganic components of mlss the reasons for the different results might be due to the difference in influent characteristics and reactor types the higher mlss and mlvss concentration in r2 should theoretically promote microbial degradation performance but the lower mlvss mlss indicated that inhibition of microbial activity caused by sulfate reducing the cod and nh4 n removal in section 3 1 mlvss contains active microorganisms and other organic matter the increase in mlvss concentration do not mean that the concentration of active microorganisms is high and the degradation performance is excellent therefore activated sludge metabolites were compared in the later experiments 3 2 2 comparison of floc particle sizes in the process of membrane filtration smaller activated sludge can easily affect the membrane 50 the tendency of small particles to adhere to the membrane surface is higher than larger particles the fouling contribution of each component in the bioreactor depends on the particle size as both permeation drag and back transport velocity are particle size related functions 51 fig 4 shows the particle size distribution of sludge mixed liquor in mbrs on the 60th day of mbr operation the diff lines in the particle size distribution map refer to the percentage content of the particle size and the cumu lines refer to the cumulant of the percentage content of all particles before a certain particle size the median diameter d50 refers to the sludge particle size corresponding to the cumu line when the cumulative particle size content is 50 compared with the median diameter d50 of sludge mixture 90 17 μm in r2 was lower than the value 112 6 μm in r1 the result indicated that the addition of sulfate reduced the floc particle size salinity shock could cause the death of microbial cells or partial disintegration of sludge flocs 52 similarly raynaud et al 53 found that adding sodium chloride to activated sludge caused the release of fine particles which were believed to clog the filter media the reduction in particle size will increase the membrane pore blockage thereby increasing membrane fouling 3 2 3 comparison of activated sludge metabolites comparing fig 5 a the total amount of eps extracted by sludge in r2 fig 5 b was higher than that in r1 indicating that the number of inactive microorganisms in r2 was large in addition the hydrophobicity of activated sludge in r2 was increased compared to r1 relying on pn ps in eps 54 the increase in sludge hydrophobicity could decrease zeta potential and result in irregular floc shape of sludge 55 as shown in fig 6 the total amount of smp and the pn ps in r2 were higher than the values in r1 this result supported the conclusion that smp was the dissolved eps 56 combining the results in section 3 2 1 the higher concentrations of eps and smp were attributed to the high concentration of suspended biomass which might provide more growth and biomass attenuation opportunities for eps and smp to be released from substrate metabolism into solution 12 this factor also led to the increase of inactive biomass in sludge mixed liquor suspended solids higher smp was one of the factors increasing the cod concentration in the r2 supernatant moreover higher smp could increase the viscosity of the sludge mixture accelerate the formation of the gel layer and aggravate the deposition of the cake layer 57 3 2 4 microbial community analysis the coordination of different microorganisms is considered to be the important removal mechanism of organic pollutants in mbrs 58 comparing fig 8 with fig 7 it can be seen that the presence of sulfate also affected the species of microorganism community in addition to altering the sludge activity in the mbrs during the operation of r1 the characteristic microorganisms in activated sludge were mainly rotifer stenoptera epistylis paramecium and rotifer fig 7 the small amount of paramecium and the presence of epistylis indicated that activated sludge was in favorable condition in r1 the characteristic microorganisms of activated sludge were mainly rotifer stenoptera nematode clock worm and actinomycete one kind of filamentous microorganism during the r2 operation fig 8 the emergence of free living nematodes implied that the purification degree in biological treatment was not ideal higher mlss and relatively insufficient dissolved oxygen might be the important reasons causing the presence of rotted nematodes and smaller vorticella in r2 excessive growth and propagation of filamentous microorganism could increase the viscosity of sludge mixture and deteriorate the sludge sedimentation performance 3 3 effect of sulfate on membrane fouling in mbr 3 3 1 difference of sludge sedimentation performance the above analysis results of eps smp and pn ps indicated that sulfate affected microbial metabolism coupled with the increase in sludge concentration and the decrease in sludge particle size a large amount of flocs might be dispersed 45 50 59 therefore the sedimentation of activated sludge in r2 might be deteriorated fig 9 shows the changes of sedimentation of activated sludge with time in mbrs as can be seen from fig 9 penicillin and sulfate could both caused the increase in sv value of activated sludge due to the inhibition of microbial activity during the early operation of the mbrs however the sv of r1 stabilized at about 28 in the later stage of operation indicating that the activated sludge gradually adapted to the penicillin wastewater a significant difference from r1 was that the sv of r2 continued to increase until it approached 100 indicating that sulfate had a more serious impact on activated sludge than penicillin 3 3 2 tmp evolution in r1 and r2 poor performance of sludge sedimentation will increase the diffusion rate of sludge flocs to the membrane surface thereby may promote the occurrence and development of membrane fouling fig 10 characterizes membrane fouling by tmp as a function of operation time the growth rate of tmp in r2 was faster than that in r1 which indicated that the membrane filtration performance of sludge mixture in r2 was poor the tmp value reached 20 kpa was on the 48th day in r1 and was on the 28th day in r2 this result implied that the sulfate shortened the operating time of the mbr by about 40 the reason might be attributed to the fact that more colloids blocked the pores of the membrane and fine sludge flocs deposited on the membrane surface in r2 therefore sem of fouled membrane resistance distribution of membrane filtration and contribution of sludge fractions to fouling were analyzed in subsequent experiments 3 3 3 sem of fouled membrane and resistance distribution fig 11 a and d show that the membrane surfaces were deposited by the cake layer and the membrane pores were completely covered in the mbrs at the end of operation in particular the fouled membrane surface was smoother and denser in r2 comparing the membrane cross sections of fig 10 b and e it can be found that the cross section thickness of the fouled membrane in r2 320 81 μm was significantly higher than that in r1 109 06 μm from the morphology of the membrane pores after the physical and chemical cleaning showed in fig 11 c and f it can be seen that the profile of membrane pore in r1 was clearer than that in r2 table 4 illustrates the resistance distribution of membrane filtration in mbrs was dominated by the cake layer resistance rc the cake layer on the membrane surface was the main factor causing membrane fouling in long term operation 60 due to the large amount of eps and smp produced in r2 the colloids and solutes of sludge mixture adsorbed deposited and blocked the membrane pores more severely ultimately exhibiting the higher pore blocking resistance rp and the higher irreversible resistance ri severe membrane pore blockage could accelerate the formation and development of cake layer 61 62 zhou et al had reported that filamentous microbes 5 10 μm associated with micro particles resulted in higher filter cake fouling resistance and free living cells in the form of colloidal particles 0 45 1 μm caused more severe pores blockage 63 combined with the above results it can be concluded that sulfate changed the characteristics of activated sludge and thus caused the difference in membrane fouling degree 3 3 4 contribution of sludge fractions to membrane fouling the increase in sludge concentration and metabolic products and the decrease of sludge activity and particle size resulted in the increase of membrane resistance 64 table 5 illustrates that rt value of r2 was 21 40 1010 m 1 significantly higher than 6 49 1010 m 1 in r1 moreover the main fouling contributor in sludge mixture changed from suspended solids 48 84 in r1 to colloids 59 21 in r2 due to the effect of sulfate the results in the aforementioned section showed that sulfate inhibited microbial activity and released colloidal eps resulting in severe membrane pore blockage and dense cake layer in r2 therefore rss and rcol showed a dramatic development in r2 compared to r1 rsol increased from 1 08 1010 m 1 in r1 to 2 89 1010 m 1 in r2 indicating that the increase of ri was also related to the adsorption crystallization and precipitation of solute in the pores of the membrane 4 conclusions in order to explore the effects of sulfate on activated sludge characteristics and membrane fouling in mbr treating penicillin wastewater comparative experiments were carried out in this paper mbr exhibited higher performance in the removal of cod and nh4 n where biodegradation was the primary removal mechanism for pollutants and membrane retention had a positive effect on stabilizing the effluent quality sulfate had a negative impact on the biodegradation of cod and nh4 n in the early stages of mbr operation the lower mlvss mlss indicated that inhibition of microbial activity was one of the important reasons for the reduction of pollutants treatment performance in addition larger pn ps in the eps and higher smp resulted in the reduction in the sludge sedimentation performance and the increase in the supernatant cod by affecting the hydrophobicity of the sludge flocs and the viscosity of the sludge mixture the long term presence of sulfate altered the microbial species and the filamentous microorganism therein could also deteriorate the filterability of the sludge mixture tmp evolution showed that the sulfate shortened the operating time of the mbr by about 40 the results of the resistance distribution and the fouling contribution proved that the resistance generated by severe membrane pore blockage and dense cake layer which was mainly derived from the colloidal component in the sludge mixture the results of this paper suggest that desalting pretreatment should be considered and salt tolerant activated sludge should be cultured and acclimated when mbr was used to treat penicillin wastewater declaration

13791,the capacity of granular activated carbon gac to increase methane productivity during the anaerobic digestion of liquid and raw fractions of swine effluent was evaluated microbial incubations were conducted with gac at a particle size of 0 6 mm and inoculated with anaerobic sludge the volume of methane produced was 1 42 and 1 33 fold higher in the raw effluent re and liquid fraction lf respectively compared to the controls lacking gac the conversion efficiency was also improved up to 94 1 by gac addition the methane production rates in gac incubations with re were increased 37 8 and 11 5 with lf in relation to the controls the addition of gac also impacted the lag phase which was evidenced by a decrement of 66 6 and 18 7 for lf and re respectively compared to controls high percentages of methanosaeta species were found in all experimental conditions ranging from 74 to 88 of the archaeal community however when re was employed as the substrate for methanogenesis the presence of gac increased 13 2 the composition of methanosaeta respect to the control keywords methane activated carbon swine effluent anaerobic digestion conductive material 1 introduction contribution of pig raising to the total livestock production has increased 4 fold worldwide during the last 50 years and it is expected to keep growing over the following decades 1 simultaneously to economic growth there are many environmental impacts associated with this activity such as climate change and eutrophication mainly due to inappropriate manure management 2 effluents from piggery farms are a complex matrix not easy to be treated by conventional systems due to its high organic matter concentration up to 50 chemical oxygen demand cod g l hormones pathogens nutrients veterinary drugs and heavy metals 3 8 nonetheless despite the inhibitory toxicological effects of heavy metals antibiotics and ammonia on anaerobic processes biogas production from swine effluents have attracted the attention due to its high content of organic matter biogas is produced by anaerobic microorganisms through the anaerobic digestion process this process consists in four steps hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogensis and methanogenesis in the first step complex organic matter is converted to soluble compounds in the acidogenesis or fermentation step soluble substrates are converted to volatile fatty acids by fermentative bacteria then in the acetogenesis volatile organics accids are fermented to produce acetate hydrogen and co2 finally these three main fermentative products are precursors of methane formation in the methanogenesis step syntrophic interactions between fermentative bacteria and methanogenic archaea drive anaerobic digestion processes for methane production due to electrical connections between these microorganisms 9 the electrical connections between microorganisms takes place through a process called direct interspecies electron transfer diet and may potentially occur by three mechanisms via conductive pili via membrane bound electron transport proteins and via abiotic with conductive materials 9 10 diet was initially discovered in a co culture of geobacter metallireducens ethanol oxidizing and electron donating bacteria and geobacter sulfurreducens electron accepting bacteria to finally reduce fumarate 11 then the diet process was documented for the first time in methanogenic wastewater digester aggregates which was electrically conductive with an abundance of geobacter species in the aggregates 12 metal and carbon based materials have been used as conductive agents to promote methane production among them magnetite hematite biochar granular activated carbon gac carbon cloth and carbon nanotubes are the most used 13 conductive materials can either substitute or enhance the effectiveness of pili as the electrical connection between microbial species 9 pure and mixed cultures can sustain diet but most of these assays were conducted with easily biodegradable substrates such as glucose fatty acids and alcohols 14 17 in few cases the diet has also been documented using mixed cultures and some complex organics as waste sludge 18 19 dog food 20 wastewater 21 and swine manure 22 23 anaerobic digestion of swine effluents as a treatment coupled to biogas production is widely applied but methane productivity and organic pollutant removal are not highly efficient in many cases among the efforts to improve the anaerobic digestion process are pretreatment methods electrical thermal biological and oxidative supplement additives mineral nutrients metal oxide nanoparticles co substrates and enzymes and acceleration via diet 24 for swine manure digestion the addition of graphene oxide did not increase methane production in fact it was decreased but the propionate degradation was enhanced 25 conversely fe2o3 and magnetite addition to microbial cultures increased the methane production during swine manure degradation 22 26 besides it was reported that the addition of gac improved the dry anaerobic digestion of swine manure by increasing the volumetric biogas production rate 23 nonetheless the methane production with carbon materials using the liquid and solid fractions of swine effluents was not previously assessed this study aimed to evaluate the capacity of gac to improve methane productivity during the treatment of liquid and raw fractions of swine effluent the results were modeled by the gompertz model to identify the methane production rates for all conditions tested 2 materials and methods 2 1 swine effluent inoculum and gac swine manure effluent was collected from a finishing pig farm located in sonora mexico a portion of the effluent without previous treatment in the farm was separated to be used as raw effluent re the other portion of the sample was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min to separate solids and collect the liquid fraction lf which were used as organic substrates to evaluate methane production using gac the substrates were analyzed to determine ph cod total solids total volatile solids and ammonium 27 obtaining the values indicated in table 1 the methanogenic sludge used as inoculum was collected from an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb reactor installed in a brewery factory the sludge was not previously acclimated to swine effluents the content of volatile suspended solids vss was 9 5 in wet weight the gac carboactive 8 30 clarimex was sieved to obtain particles of 0 6 mm and was washed with distilled water to remove fine powder particles then was dried in an oven at 60 c the gac was selected due to its proven capacity to act as redox mediating agent 28 2 2 methane production assays incubations were prepared in serum bottles 120 ml with 15 g gac l in triplicate the re and lf samples were bubbled with n2 gas for 10 min to create anaerobic conditions then 50 ml of each were added to the bottles anaerobic granular sludge was disintegrated with a sieve of 350 μm and then inoculated at 1 g vss l rubber stoppers and aluminum caps were used to seal all vials and then the headspace was flushed with n2 for 5 min to remove the oxygen traces the bottles were incubated in a shaker at 150 rpm and 40 c controls without gac for each type of wastewater fraction were also included periodically during the 24 days of incubation the methane produced was measured by the liquid displacement method using a 2 naoh solution to remove co2 after the incubation period samples were taken for cod and ph determination initial and final cod values were used to calculate the cod removal efficiency methane yield and methane conversion efficiency then the data were statistically analyzed by an anova test with a confidence level of 95 a fisher s least significant difference lsd post hoc test was done to verify differences between groups 2 3 adsorption experiments with gac serum bottles were similarly prepared as previously described for methane assays but without using the anaerobic sludge to evaluate the capacity of gac to adsorb organic matter and ammonium contained in swine effluents the bottles were incubated in a shaker at 150 rpm and 40 c until equilibrium was achieved after four days the adsorption experiments could provide in part additional information on the role of gac as adsorbent and its impact on methanogenesis process the adsorption capacity of organic matter and ammonium ion was obtained by a mass balance using the eq 1 as follows 1 q c o c e q v m where q is the adsorption capacity mg g co and ceq are the initial and equilibrium concentration mg l respectively v is the volume l of wastewater fractions and m is the mass g of adsorbent 2 4 kinetic model for methane production methane production data were modeled using the modified gompertz model 29 the kinetics of methane production in batch reactors was assumed as a specific growth rate of methanogens in a digester the modified gompertz model eq 2 is as follows 2 m t m m a x exp exp 2 71828 r m a x m m a x λ t 1 where m t is the cumulative volume ml of methane produced t is the cumulative time days λ is the time days of lag phase mmax is the maximum cumulative volume ml of methane and rmax is the maximum biogas production rate ml day the kinetic parameters were estimated with statistica six sigma 7 2 5 dna extraction and 16s genomic libraries construction anaerobic sludge samples were decanted and then taken from the microcosms at the end of the methanogenesis kinetics under sterile conditions approximately 250 mg of the recovered biomass was used for dna extraction using the powersoil dna extraction kit mo bio laboratories carlsbald ca usa according to the protocol described by the manufacturer the dna isolated from each sample was used to amplify the 16s rrna regions of bacteria v3 v4 region 341f 805r 30 and archaea 340f 1000r 31 both fused with illumina adapter overhang nucleotide sequences 25 μl pcr reactions were carried out to this end using an invitrogen hf platinum taq polymerase thermofisher scientific usa the pcr program for the bacterial 16s targeted amplification was as follows denaturation at 95 c for 90 s followed by 30 cycles of amplification at 95 c for 15 s 57 c for 30 s 72 c for 30 s 80 c for 30 s and finished with 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 10 s the pcrs for the archaeal 16 s rna region were performed under the conditions reported by gantner et al 31 the pcr products were indexed using the nextera xt index kit v2 illumina san diego ca according to the illumina s 16 s metagenomic sequencing library preparation protocol libraries were further sequenced by single end with illumina miseq sequencer 2 6 bioinformatics analysis mothur open source software v 1 34 4 was used for the analysis of 16s rrna libraries 32 sequences with a length of less than 500 bp homopolymer runs of eight or more bases those with more than one mismatch to the sequencing primer and q value average below 25 were discarded the potential occurrence of chimeric sequences was analyzed using uchime algorithm sequences were aligned against the silva v 132 16s rrna gene database using the nearest alignment space termination nast algorithm group membership was determined prior to trim of the barcode and primer sequence a distance matrix was calculated through the set of non redundant sequences and the readings were grouped into operational taxonomic units otus with a similarity threshold of 97 mothur s bayesian classifier and the silva 132 reference set were used to taxonomically categorize the sequences taxonomic assignments were made with a confidence threshold greater than 80 of bootstrap value the accession numbers of archaeal and bacterial sequences in this work were deposited in the genbank sequence read archive under bioproject number prjna578742 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of gac on biogas production there was an increment in the cumulative methane production in re and lf cultures supplemented with gac compared to incubations performed without gac after 24 days of incubation fig 1 a c table 2 in re incubations the volume of methane produced in the presence of gac was 165 7 ml which represents an increment of 1 42 fold compared to the methane produced by the action of microorganisms in the absence of gac 116 4 ml in lf incubations the increment was 1 33 fold higher in cultures with gac 23 6 ml concerning the cultures without gac 17 7 ml the maximum daily peak of methane production registered in lf gac incubations occurred on day 2 two days before the control in re cultures the maximum peaks were achieved on day 8 for the two conditions registering 30 ml of methane but before and after of that day the volumes of methane measured in re gac incubations were higher than the volumes with re fig 1b d the addition of gac during the anaerobic digestion of swine manure wastewater had also an impact on methane yield cod removal and conversion efficiency table 2 the cod removal efficiency was increased 16 7 in lf gac incubations respect to the control and with re were similar regardless the presence of gac the anova test did not show a significant difference between means for cod removal efficiency in incubations with gac and their respective controls table 2 the methane yield respect to the cod removed was highest in gac cultures achieving 376 3 ml ch4 g codremoved with re and 301 7 ml ch4 g codremoved with lf table 2 these results represent increments of 19 for re and 14 for lf in relation to their respective controls then the conversion efficiencies from cod to methane were highest in gac cultures obtaining 94 1 with re and 75 8 with lf experimental data were properly adjusted to the gompertz model table 3 for re and lf samples the responses in the lag phase λ maximum cumulative methane mmax and maximum production rate rmax were improved due to gac addition the lag phase decreased in lf and re cultures due to gac addition in relation to cultures without gac the positive impact of gac in the lag phase for lf incubations was higher than the effect achieved for re the methane production rate in re incubations increases from 14 0 to 19 3 ml day due to gac which represents an increase of 37 8 the increase in lf using gac was 11 5 kinetic parameters obtained from gompertz model could be used as an alternative to design the gas chamber of batch reactors from anaerobic digestion of manure where the methane volume produced is the key paremeter 33 the addition of gac promoted changes in the concentration of organic matter and ammonium due to their adsorption capacity the maximum adsorption capacity was achieved after four days for organic matter the adsorption was 27 2 mg g for lf and 60 5 mg g for re fig 2 then the adsorption process by gac promoted a decrement of 9 8 in the cod concentration from 9260 mg l to 8352 5 mg l for re and in lf a decrement of 23 from 1770 mg l to 1362 mg l it is possible that organic matter adsorption limits the substrate availability for microorganisms nonetheless even though the gac has a higher organic matter adsorption capacity compared to other carbon based materials its addition promoted a higher methane production during the digestion of swine wastewater 34 which suggests its role as electron conduit even so will be necessary to elucidate if the adsorbed organic matter may suffer some extent of degradation to contribute to methane production the ammonium adsorption on gac was 1 2 mg g for lf and 1 9 mg g for re fig 2 similar to the values achieved from a synthetic solution of ammonium chloride 35 the adsorption process promoted a decrement in the ammonium concentration of 5 5 for lf and 9 5 for re resulting in 301 0 mg l in general the inhibitory toxicity effect of ammonium on anaerobic digestion is between 1500 and 3000 mg l 36 so it is not expected an adverse impact on methanogenesis previous studies indicate that gac has been used with particles sizes from 0 84 to 2 mm at concentrations of 3 3 to 50 g l achieving increments in the methane production from 1 1 to 18 fold compared to the controls 13 in most of these studies the substrates used were easily biodegradable in comparison to complex substrates found in swine manure effluents the anaerobic digestion process could be limited by the nature of substrates while the hydrolysis step is commonly limited by complex organics solids the availability of soluble organic substrates is the limiting step for the methanogenesis 37 separation of lf from swine wastewater has shown a positive effect by increasing the methane productivity over re digestion 38 but in the present study re had a higher response although gac addition promoted an increase in the methane productivity in the two digested samples the highest methane yield 376 3 ml ch4 g codconsumed was found in re sample with 94 1 of conversion efficiency table 2 which is a high value considering the theoretical value of 400 ml ch4 g codconsumed 36 in previous studies the methane conversion efficiencies in experiments lacking conductive materials were found between 17 to 79 in all cases from the digestion of complex substrates including swine effluents 39 41 pretreatment methods for complex organic wastes such as biological thermal hydrolysis mechanical and chemical as a strategy to improve their biodegradability substantially increases methane productivity 42 44 nevertheless in some cases these methods may also increase the cost making processes non viable the methane production by biological processes is the commonly used worldwide strategy for bioenergy generation it has been applied in small scale to obtain energy from organic wastes in rural communities 45 as well as in industrial scale systems for treating wastewater 46 the addition of conductive materials could also be considered as a relevant strategy to improve methane production and digestion of organic complex specifically low cost materials such as gac 2 25 usd kg in mexico are potential candidates for their use in full scale anaerobic bioreactors but optimal conditions should be found to define the proper dose and size of gac particles 3 2 microbial analysis high percentages of methanosaeta species were found in all experimental conditions ranging from 74 to 88 of the whole archaeal community fig 3 a however in re gac incubations there was an increase of approximately 13 2 of this archaeal taxon respect to the re controls lacking gac in contrast lf gac did not promote any increases in the percentages of methanosaeta concerning the controls lacking gac fig 3a these results suggest that substrate composition in re combined with the effect of gac triggered the proliferation of these archaeal species which thus were potentially responsible for the highest rates of methane production observed among all the experimental treatments the presence of methanosaeta species which are abundant in this study have been associated with the diet process due to its capacity to accept electrons using biological electrical connections 47 but also through the use of conductive materials as gac 18 contrastingly those experiments in which lf was employed as the substrate for methanogenesis the percentages of methanobacterium and an uncultured phylotype from the methanobacteriaceae family did increase their percentages with respect to the controls lacking gac fig 3b these results imply that under the lf experimental conditions minority members of the archaeal community were positively affected due to the presence of gac fig 3b from the bacterial counterpart five classes were found to join the methanosaeta in the re gac treatment which by far displayed the highest methane production rates among all treatments percentages within microbial community 10 fig 4 a the sinergystia aminicenantia γ proteobacteria clostridia and bacteroidia bacterial classes were present in percentages from 14 to 10 respectively fig 4a the jgi 0000079 d21 genus was the most abundant phylotype within that synergistia class 79 simirlarly an unclassified aminicenantales genus pseudomonas the dtu014 genus of the ruminococcaceae family and the bacteroidetes vadinha17 genus constituted 100 31 36 and 55 of each predominant bacterial class respectively fig 4b geobacter species are key in diet process due to their capacity to exchange electrons to acetoclastic methanogens in some studies it was documented the enrichment of geobacter in the presence of conductive materials but in most cases it was present at low percentages or absent 13 these findings agree with the results shown in the present work in which re gac incubations indicated an abundance of 4 geobacter of the δ proteobacteria class 5 in bacterial community fig 4a b the species presumably responsible for the diet process in re gac system are pseudomonas which showed an abundance of 31 corresponding to the fraction of γ proteobacteria 13 in bacterial community fig 4a b pseudomonas species are known as exoelectrogens for their ability to transfer electrons to solid phase electron acceptors such as gac 48 and was also previously suggested as responsible as possible electron donating bacteria for diet 49 additional genera previously reported in methane producing systems detected in this experimental setting were an uncultured anaerolineae taxon which appears to be involved in electrons to anodes but it is also believed that it is responsible for producing metabolic intermediaries which are then used by other anode coupling microorganisms 50 the mesotoga genus from the thermotogae class is also able to participate in anaerobic digestion for methanogenesis 51 but its role as electrogenic microorganism has not been defined other genera of the δ proteobacteria such as the syntrophorhabdus syntrophus desulfovirga and syntrophobacter genera are closely related to the electro active geobacter genus fig 4b 52 53 the high methane productivity observed in re gac incubations could also be partly associated to the presence of synergistaceae 79 in synergistia class and bacteroidetes 55 in bacteroidia class both species reported as players to participate in the decomposition of complex organic matter 54 55 such as swine effluents 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated that gac 15 g l addition increases the methane productivity during the anaerobic digestion of lf and re of swine effluent this type of effluent is considered difficult to be treated due to its content of complex organic matter nonetheless the results indicate the volume of methane produced was 1 42 and 1 33 fold higher in the re and lf respectively compared to the controls lacking gac the conversion efficiency was also improved up to 94 1 by gac addition besides gac promoted a decrease in the lag phase and increments in both the production rates and the maximum volume of methane produced specifically the methane production rate was increased 11 5 and 37 8 in lf and re incubations supplemented with gac respectively gac addition is a suitable strategy to efficiently recover energy from complex organic matter wastes certainly in re incubations the methane yield was 19 higher compared to the control these results could be attributable to the presence and establishment of microbial species reported as suitable to support the diet process some of these microbial species are geobacter and pseudomonas which are electron donating bacteria to methanogens as

13791,the capacity of granular activated carbon gac to increase methane productivity during the anaerobic digestion of liquid and raw fractions of swine effluent was evaluated microbial incubations were conducted with gac at a particle size of 0 6 mm and inoculated with anaerobic sludge the volume of methane produced was 1 42 and 1 33 fold higher in the raw effluent re and liquid fraction lf respectively compared to the controls lacking gac the conversion efficiency was also improved up to 94 1 by gac addition the methane production rates in gac incubations with re were increased 37 8 and 11 5 with lf in relation to the controls the addition of gac also impacted the lag phase which was evidenced by a decrement of 66 6 and 18 7 for lf and re respectively compared to controls high percentages of methanosaeta species were found in all experimental conditions ranging from 74 to 88 of the archaeal community however when re was employed as the substrate for methanogenesis the presence of gac increased 13 2 the composition of methanosaeta respect to the control keywords methane activated carbon swine effluent anaerobic digestion conductive material 1 introduction contribution of pig raising to the total livestock production has increased 4 fold worldwide during the last 50 years and it is expected to keep growing over the following decades 1 simultaneously to economic growth there are many environmental impacts associated with this activity such as climate change and eutrophication mainly due to inappropriate manure management 2 effluents from piggery farms are a complex matrix not easy to be treated by conventional systems due to its high organic matter concentration up to 50 chemical oxygen demand cod g l hormones pathogens nutrients veterinary drugs and heavy metals 3 8 nonetheless despite the inhibitory toxicological effects of heavy metals antibiotics and ammonia on anaerobic processes biogas production from swine effluents have attracted the attention due to its high content of organic matter biogas is produced by anaerobic microorganisms through the anaerobic digestion process this process consists in four steps hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogensis and methanogenesis in the first step complex organic matter is converted to soluble compounds in the acidogenesis or fermentation step soluble substrates are converted to volatile fatty acids by fermentative bacteria then in the acetogenesis volatile organics accids are fermented to produce acetate hydrogen and co2 finally these three main fermentative products are precursors of methane formation in the methanogenesis step syntrophic interactions between fermentative bacteria and methanogenic archaea drive anaerobic digestion processes for methane production due to electrical connections between these microorganisms 9 the electrical connections between microorganisms takes place through a process called direct interspecies electron transfer diet and may potentially occur by three mechanisms via conductive pili via membrane bound electron transport proteins and via abiotic with conductive materials 9 10 diet was initially discovered in a co culture of geobacter metallireducens ethanol oxidizing and electron donating bacteria and geobacter sulfurreducens electron accepting bacteria to finally reduce fumarate 11 then the diet process was documented for the first time in methanogenic wastewater digester aggregates which was electrically conductive with an abundance of geobacter species in the aggregates 12 metal and carbon based materials have been used as conductive agents to promote methane production among them magnetite hematite biochar granular activated carbon gac carbon cloth and carbon nanotubes are the most used 13 conductive materials can either substitute or enhance the effectiveness of pili as the electrical connection between microbial species 9 pure and mixed cultures can sustain diet but most of these assays were conducted with easily biodegradable substrates such as glucose fatty acids and alcohols 14 17 in few cases the diet has also been documented using mixed cultures and some complex organics as waste sludge 18 19 dog food 20 wastewater 21 and swine manure 22 23 anaerobic digestion of swine effluents as a treatment coupled to biogas production is widely applied but methane productivity and organic pollutant removal are not highly efficient in many cases among the efforts to improve the anaerobic digestion process are pretreatment methods electrical thermal biological and oxidative supplement additives mineral nutrients metal oxide nanoparticles co substrates and enzymes and acceleration via diet 24 for swine manure digestion the addition of graphene oxide did not increase methane production in fact it was decreased but the propionate degradation was enhanced 25 conversely fe2o3 and magnetite addition to microbial cultures increased the methane production during swine manure degradation 22 26 besides it was reported that the addition of gac improved the dry anaerobic digestion of swine manure by increasing the volumetric biogas production rate 23 nonetheless the methane production with carbon materials using the liquid and solid fractions of swine effluents was not previously assessed this study aimed to evaluate the capacity of gac to improve methane productivity during the treatment of liquid and raw fractions of swine effluent the results were modeled by the gompertz model to identify the methane production rates for all conditions tested 2 materials and methods 2 1 swine effluent inoculum and gac swine manure effluent was collected from a finishing pig farm located in sonora mexico a portion of the effluent without previous treatment in the farm was separated to be used as raw effluent re the other portion of the sample was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min to separate solids and collect the liquid fraction lf which were used as organic substrates to evaluate methane production using gac the substrates were analyzed to determine ph cod total solids total volatile solids and ammonium 27 obtaining the values indicated in table 1 the methanogenic sludge used as inoculum was collected from an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb reactor installed in a brewery factory the sludge was not previously acclimated to swine effluents the content of volatile suspended solids vss was 9 5 in wet weight the gac carboactive 8 30 clarimex was sieved to obtain particles of 0 6 mm and was washed with distilled water to remove fine powder particles then was dried in an oven at 60 c the gac was selected due to its proven capacity to act as redox mediating agent 28 2 2 methane production assays incubations were prepared in serum bottles 120 ml with 15 g gac l in triplicate the re and lf samples were bubbled with n2 gas for 10 min to create anaerobic conditions then 50 ml of each were added to the bottles anaerobic granular sludge was disintegrated with a sieve of 350 μm and then inoculated at 1 g vss l rubber stoppers and aluminum caps were used to seal all vials and then the headspace was flushed with n2 for 5 min to remove the oxygen traces the bottles were incubated in a shaker at 150 rpm and 40 c controls without gac for each type of wastewater fraction were also included periodically during the 24 days of incubation the methane produced was measured by the liquid displacement method using a 2 naoh solution to remove co2 after the incubation period samples were taken for cod and ph determination initial and final cod values were used to calculate the cod removal efficiency methane yield and methane conversion efficiency then the data were statistically analyzed by an anova test with a confidence level of 95 a fisher s least significant difference lsd post hoc test was done to verify differences between groups 2 3 adsorption experiments with gac serum bottles were similarly prepared as previously described for methane assays but without using the anaerobic sludge to evaluate the capacity of gac to adsorb organic matter and ammonium contained in swine effluents the bottles were incubated in a shaker at 150 rpm and 40 c until equilibrium was achieved after four days the adsorption experiments could provide in part additional information on the role of gac as adsorbent and its impact on methanogenesis process the adsorption capacity of organic matter and ammonium ion was obtained by a mass balance using the eq 1 as follows 1 q c o c e q v m where q is the adsorption capacity mg g co and ceq are the initial and equilibrium concentration mg l respectively v is the volume l of wastewater fractions and m is the mass g of adsorbent 2 4 kinetic model for methane production methane production data were modeled using the modified gompertz model 29 the kinetics of methane production in batch reactors was assumed as a specific growth rate of methanogens in a digester the modified gompertz model eq 2 is as follows 2 m t m m a x exp exp 2 71828 r m a x m m a x λ t 1 where m t is the cumulative volume ml of methane produced t is the cumulative time days λ is the time days of lag phase mmax is the maximum cumulative volume ml of methane and rmax is the maximum biogas production rate ml day the kinetic parameters were estimated with statistica six sigma 7 2 5 dna extraction and 16s genomic libraries construction anaerobic sludge samples were decanted and then taken from the microcosms at the end of the methanogenesis kinetics under sterile conditions approximately 250 mg of the recovered biomass was used for dna extraction using the powersoil dna extraction kit mo bio laboratories carlsbald ca usa according to the protocol described by the manufacturer the dna isolated from each sample was used to amplify the 16s rrna regions of bacteria v3 v4 region 341f 805r 30 and archaea 340f 1000r 31 both fused with illumina adapter overhang nucleotide sequences 25 μl pcr reactions were carried out to this end using an invitrogen hf platinum taq polymerase thermofisher scientific usa the pcr program for the bacterial 16s targeted amplification was as follows denaturation at 95 c for 90 s followed by 30 cycles of amplification at 95 c for 15 s 57 c for 30 s 72 c for 30 s 80 c for 30 s and finished with 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 10 s the pcrs for the archaeal 16 s rna region were performed under the conditions reported by gantner et al 31 the pcr products were indexed using the nextera xt index kit v2 illumina san diego ca according to the illumina s 16 s metagenomic sequencing library preparation protocol libraries were further sequenced by single end with illumina miseq sequencer 2 6 bioinformatics analysis mothur open source software v 1 34 4 was used for the analysis of 16s rrna libraries 32 sequences with a length of less than 500 bp homopolymer runs of eight or more bases those with more than one mismatch to the sequencing primer and q value average below 25 were discarded the potential occurrence of chimeric sequences was analyzed using uchime algorithm sequences were aligned against the silva v 132 16s rrna gene database using the nearest alignment space termination nast algorithm group membership was determined prior to trim of the barcode and primer sequence a distance matrix was calculated through the set of non redundant sequences and the readings were grouped into operational taxonomic units otus with a similarity threshold of 97 mothur s bayesian classifier and the silva 132 reference set were used to taxonomically categorize the sequences taxonomic assignments were made with a confidence threshold greater than 80 of bootstrap value the accession numbers of archaeal and bacterial sequences in this work were deposited in the genbank sequence read archive under bioproject number prjna578742 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of gac on biogas production there was an increment in the cumulative methane production in re and lf cultures supplemented with gac compared to incubations performed without gac after 24 days of incubation fig 1 a c table 2 in re incubations the volume of methane produced in the presence of gac was 165 7 ml which represents an increment of 1 42 fold compared to the methane produced by the action of microorganisms in the absence of gac 116 4 ml in lf incubations the increment was 1 33 fold higher in cultures with gac 23 6 ml concerning the cultures without gac 17 7 ml the maximum daily peak of methane production registered in lf gac incubations occurred on day 2 two days before the control in re cultures the maximum peaks were achieved on day 8 for the two conditions registering 30 ml of methane but before and after of that day the volumes of methane measured in re gac incubations were higher than the volumes with re fig 1b d the addition of gac during the anaerobic digestion of swine manure wastewater had also an impact on methane yield cod removal and conversion efficiency table 2 the cod removal efficiency was increased 16 7 in lf gac incubations respect to the control and with re were similar regardless the presence of gac the anova test did not show a significant difference between means for cod removal efficiency in incubations with gac and their respective controls table 2 the methane yield respect to the cod removed was highest in gac cultures achieving 376 3 ml ch4 g codremoved with re and 301 7 ml ch4 g codremoved with lf table 2 these results represent increments of 19 for re and 14 for lf in relation to their respective controls then the conversion efficiencies from cod to methane were highest in gac cultures obtaining 94 1 with re and 75 8 with lf experimental data were properly adjusted to the gompertz model table 3 for re and lf samples the responses in the lag phase λ maximum cumulative methane mmax and maximum production rate rmax were improved due to gac addition the lag phase decreased in lf and re cultures due to gac addition in relation to cultures without gac the positive impact of gac in the lag phase for lf incubations was higher than the effect achieved for re the methane production rate in re incubations increases from 14 0 to 19 3 ml day due to gac which represents an increase of 37 8 the increase in lf using gac was 11 5 kinetic parameters obtained from gompertz model could be used as an alternative to design the gas chamber of batch reactors from anaerobic digestion of manure where the methane volume produced is the key paremeter 33 the addition of gac promoted changes in the concentration of organic matter and ammonium due to their adsorption capacity the maximum adsorption capacity was achieved after four days for organic matter the adsorption was 27 2 mg g for lf and 60 5 mg g for re fig 2 then the adsorption process by gac promoted a decrement of 9 8 in the cod concentration from 9260 mg l to 8352 5 mg l for re and in lf a decrement of 23 from 1770 mg l to 1362 mg l it is possible that organic matter adsorption limits the substrate availability for microorganisms nonetheless even though the gac has a higher organic matter adsorption capacity compared to other carbon based materials its addition promoted a higher methane production during the digestion of swine wastewater 34 which suggests its role as electron conduit even so will be necessary to elucidate if the adsorbed organic matter may suffer some extent of degradation to contribute to methane production the ammonium adsorption on gac was 1 2 mg g for lf and 1 9 mg g for re fig 2 similar to the values achieved from a synthetic solution of ammonium chloride 35 the adsorption process promoted a decrement in the ammonium concentration of 5 5 for lf and 9 5 for re resulting in 301 0 mg l in general the inhibitory toxicity effect of ammonium on anaerobic digestion is between 1500 and 3000 mg l 36 so it is not expected an adverse impact on methanogenesis previous studies indicate that gac has been used with particles sizes from 0 84 to 2 mm at concentrations of 3 3 to 50 g l achieving increments in the methane production from 1 1 to 18 fold compared to the controls 13 in most of these studies the substrates used were easily biodegradable in comparison to complex substrates found in swine manure effluents the anaerobic digestion process could be limited by the nature of substrates while the hydrolysis step is commonly limited by complex organics solids the availability of soluble organic substrates is the limiting step for the methanogenesis 37 separation of lf from swine wastewater has shown a positive effect by increasing the methane productivity over re digestion 38 but in the present study re had a higher response although gac addition promoted an increase in the methane productivity in the two digested samples the highest methane yield 376 3 ml ch4 g codconsumed was found in re sample with 94 1 of conversion efficiency table 2 which is a high value considering the theoretical value of 400 ml ch4 g codconsumed 36 in previous studies the methane conversion efficiencies in experiments lacking conductive materials were found between 17 to 79 in all cases from the digestion of complex substrates including swine effluents 39 41 pretreatment methods for complex organic wastes such as biological thermal hydrolysis mechanical and chemical as a strategy to improve their biodegradability substantially increases methane productivity 42 44 nevertheless in some cases these methods may also increase the cost making processes non viable the methane production by biological processes is the commonly used worldwide strategy for bioenergy generation it has been applied in small scale to obtain energy from organic wastes in rural communities 45 as well as in industrial scale systems for treating wastewater 46 the addition of conductive materials could also be considered as a relevant strategy to improve methane production and digestion of organic complex specifically low cost materials such as gac 2 25 usd kg in mexico are potential candidates for their use in full scale anaerobic bioreactors but optimal conditions should be found to define the proper dose and size of gac particles 3 2 microbial analysis high percentages of methanosaeta species were found in all experimental conditions ranging from 74 to 88 of the whole archaeal community fig 3 a however in re gac incubations there was an increase of approximately 13 2 of this archaeal taxon respect to the re controls lacking gac in contrast lf gac did not promote any increases in the percentages of methanosaeta concerning the controls lacking gac fig 3a these results suggest that substrate composition in re combined with the effect of gac triggered the proliferation of these archaeal species which thus were potentially responsible for the highest rates of methane production observed among all the experimental treatments the presence of methanosaeta species which are abundant in this study have been associated with the diet process due to its capacity to accept electrons using biological electrical connections 47 but also through the use of conductive materials as gac 18 contrastingly those experiments in which lf was employed as the substrate for methanogenesis the percentages of methanobacterium and an uncultured phylotype from the methanobacteriaceae family did increase their percentages with respect to the controls lacking gac fig 3b these results imply that under the lf experimental conditions minority members of the archaeal community were positively affected due to the presence of gac fig 3b from the bacterial counterpart five classes were found to join the methanosaeta in the re gac treatment which by far displayed the highest methane production rates among all treatments percentages within microbial community 10 fig 4 a the sinergystia aminicenantia γ proteobacteria clostridia and bacteroidia bacterial classes were present in percentages from 14 to 10 respectively fig 4a the jgi 0000079 d21 genus was the most abundant phylotype within that synergistia class 79 simirlarly an unclassified aminicenantales genus pseudomonas the dtu014 genus of the ruminococcaceae family and the bacteroidetes vadinha17 genus constituted 100 31 36 and 55 of each predominant bacterial class respectively fig 4b geobacter species are key in diet process due to their capacity to exchange electrons to acetoclastic methanogens in some studies it was documented the enrichment of geobacter in the presence of conductive materials but in most cases it was present at low percentages or absent 13 these findings agree with the results shown in the present work in which re gac incubations indicated an abundance of 4 geobacter of the δ proteobacteria class 5 in bacterial community fig 4a b the species presumably responsible for the diet process in re gac system are pseudomonas which showed an abundance of 31 corresponding to the fraction of γ proteobacteria 13 in bacterial community fig 4a b pseudomonas species are known as exoelectrogens for their ability to transfer electrons to solid phase electron acceptors such as gac 48 and was also previously suggested as responsible as possible electron donating bacteria for diet 49 additional genera previously reported in methane producing systems detected in this experimental setting were an uncultured anaerolineae taxon which appears to be involved in electrons to anodes but it is also believed that it is responsible for producing metabolic intermediaries which are then used by other anode coupling microorganisms 50 the mesotoga genus from the thermotogae class is also able to participate in anaerobic digestion for methanogenesis 51 but its role as electrogenic microorganism has not been defined other genera of the δ proteobacteria such as the syntrophorhabdus syntrophus desulfovirga and syntrophobacter genera are closely related to the electro active geobacter genus fig 4b 52 53 the high methane productivity observed in re gac incubations could also be partly associated to the presence of synergistaceae 79 in synergistia class and bacteroidetes 55 in bacteroidia class both species reported as players to participate in the decomposition of complex organic matter 54 55 such as swine effluents 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated that gac 15 g l addition increases the methane productivity during the anaerobic digestion of lf and re of swine effluent this type of effluent is considered difficult to be treated due to its content of complex organic matter nonetheless the results indicate the volume of methane produced was 1 42 and 1 33 fold higher in the re and lf respectively compared to the controls lacking gac the conversion efficiency was also improved up to 94 1 by gac addition besides gac promoted a decrease in the lag phase and increments in both the production rates and the maximum volume of methane produced specifically the methane production rate was increased 11 5 and 37 8 in lf and re incubations supplemented with gac respectively gac addition is a suitable strategy to efficiently recover energy from complex organic matter wastes certainly in re incubations the methane yield was 19 higher compared to the control these results could be attributable to the presence and establishment of microbial species reported as suitable to support the diet process some of these microbial species are geobacter and pseudomonas which are electron donating bacteria to methanogens as

13792,decentralized wastewater treatment wwt can be an energy and resource efficient alternative to the traditional centralized wwt paradigm for water stressed communities however to operate economically decentralized facilities do not typically have a wwt operator on site full time so a real time monitoring scheme is needed to quickly detect system faults and isolate the features associated with or affected by faults to ensure adequate treated water quality data collected from wwt facilities exhibit temporal dependence and experience natural fluctuations in the mean due to environmental and operator controlled factors violating the assumptions of many existing fault detection and isolation fd i methods to address this we develop a complete data driven fd i method tuned to handle the unique features of wwt data that can be run in real time and illustrate how it performs with data from a decentralized wwt facility in golden colorado usa enhanced visualization techniques are designed to assist operators in identifying features associated with the fault we present three case studies with known faults and demonstrate how this method can aid operators in detecting and diagnosing the cause of a fault more quickly keywords fault detection fault isolation lasso pca wastewater treatment 1 introduction in the traditional water management paradigm municipal and industrial wastewater is collected and conveyed to centralized wastewater treatment wwt facilities for removal of contaminants before discharge to the environment e g rivers lakes however the demand for additional water resources in arid or water stressed regions makes decentralized wwt systems an attractive option in decentralized wwt systems wastewater is treated close to the point of generation which allows the treated water to be reused locally treatment can even be tailored to provide water of different qualities for various reuse applications such as toilet flushing or irrigation not only can this new paradigm provide an additional water source for a community s water portfolio but it is also more resource and energy efficient because it does not require pumping wastewater over long distances for collection and distribution 1 3 the major drawback of decentralized wwt is that these smaller facilities have higher operating expenses it is often not feasible for decentralized facilities to have an operator on site twenty four hours a day to monitor system operations however without operator oversight faults can quickly propagate through the system which can have serious operational financial environmental or public health implications thus a fault monitoring platform is needed that would allow one operator to simultaneously monitor multiple facilities remotely fault detection fd is the detection of abnormal system behavior or behavior that deviates from accepted in control ic conditions in a high dimensional setting like wwt in which dozens of process variables are monitored knowledge of the presence of out of control oc conditions is not completely informative it is also important to identify the variables within the system that have shifted known as fault isolation fi then operators are well equipped to begin diagnosing the fault and correcting it newhart et al 4 summarize the existing monitoring paradigms used in the majority of wwt facilities and emphasize the need for more advanced data driven monitoring strategies tailored for wwt the most common process control approach in wwt is to identify an acceptable for each monitored variable and when the value exceeds a threshold the variable is identified as oc and an alarm is triggered however static univariate thresholds tend to detect faults slowly because they do not account for the relationship among variables within the system 4 typically after an alarm is triggered by one variable in the system operators attempt to identify other variables affected by the fault in order to diagnose the cause this course of action includes visually interpreting time series plots of the individual variables even for highly skilled operators who are familiar with the system it is difficult to visually identify the affected variables among many especially for faults that increase in magnitude and severity slowly over time therefore an advanced real time monitoring strategy is required to detect faults in a wwt system and identify the components associated with the fault a wealth of statistical literature exists for fd and fi collectively referred to as multivariate statistical process monitoring mspm review papers by woodall and montgomery 5 and reis and gins 6 provide a good overview of the current methods and problems in the field control charts such as the multivariate exponentially weighted moving average mewma chart 7 hotelling s t 2 chart 8 and multivariate cumulative sum mcusum chart 9 remain popular fd methods among practitioners and many variations and improvements have been proposed e g 10 15 common fi methods include contribution plots variable thinning methods and post signal diagnostic variable selection methods contribution plots visualize the contribution of each variable to the fault but the contribution of one variable can propagate to other variables known as the smearing effect which can lead to misdiagnosis 16 an alternative to contribution plots that reduces the smearing effect is reconstruction based contribution rbc 17 19 but rbc can still result in misdiagnosis in complex fault settings in which multiple variables are affected variable thinning methods focus on thinning or reducing the number of variables prior to monitoring in order to have more power in detecting the fault 20 25 alternatively some methods monitor all variables and after a fault is detected variable selection approaches such as forward selection and lasso estimation are used to identify the shifted variables 26 29 most fault detection and isolation fd i methods require an assumption that the data are independent and identically distributed many also require a distributional assumption such as multivariate normality data collected from decentralized wwt facilities violate these assumptions making most mspm methods inappropriate for direct application influent is more highly variable in quality and quantity than that of centralized facilities resulting in a natural fluctuation in variables over the course of the day week and season which causes nonstationarity in the mean furthermore changes in operational settings such as flow rates or whether a valve is open or closed can impact monitored variables and these changes are not indicative of a fault because the data are collected at a high frequency e g seconds to minutes the data have a strong positive autocorrelation present finally the data often do not follow a normal distribution and may exhibit some skewness because of the nonstationarity autocorrelation and non normality present in wwt facility data it can be especially challenging to detect faults ignoring these characteristics can result in a high false alarm rate which can be costly in terms of time and money for a decentralized wwt facility using data to then isolate the shifted variables can be even more challenging fd in wwt settings with real data has been addressed in a few papers e g 30 35 but it is much more common to use artificial simulated data from models such as the benchmark simulation model e g 36 40 when real data are used often only a small subset of the monitored variables less than 10 are considered which artificially reduces the complexity and difficulty of monitoring in this setting 31 32 34 35 41 kazor et al 30 and odom et al 33 developed advanced real time fd methods that were able to effectively monitor more than 25 variables however fi has never been applied to wwt processes outside of klanderman et al 42 who proposed a retrospective fi method using fused lasso to identify shifted variables in a period of historical data so this is the first time wherein real time fi has been tested in a wwt setting in this paper we present a fully integrated real time fd i method that accounts for nonstationarity autocorrelation and non normality all of which are present in wwt data first we account for nonstationarity by removing any trends due to environmental or operational factors which is a common approach among practitioners 42 46 then we apply an fd method based on principal component analysis pca proposed by kazor et al 30 to the detrended data which can account for temporal dependence non normality and nonstationarity caused by long term or seasonal trends not captured in the detrending process for fi we apply the post signal diagnostic variable selection method proposed by ebrahimi et al 28 which uses adaptive lasso to recover the shifted variables from the principal components pcs using three case studies from a demonstration scale decentralized wwt facility we illustrate the method s performance through an enhanced visualization tool that we design to assist operators in the fault diagnosis step we compare the results of the method with the operators post hoc analysis of the fault to see how quickly the method detects the fault which variables are identified as shifted and if the analysis can provide any additional insight into the fault the major contributions of our work are 1 the integration of fd and fi for a fully functional fd i methodology 2 the development of an enhanced visualization tool to assist with diagnosis and 3 the illustration of the method with real and complex cases the approach that we develop is tailored to the unique features of decentralized wwt data and is the first time that an fd i approach has been applied to such a complex system but the methodology is flexible enough to be applied in other fields of application section 2 introduces the real time fd i method section 3 presents three case studies with known faults from a wwt facility in golden colorado usa and section 4 discusses the capabilities and limitations of the method when considering applying it to similar systems 2 methodology the method is comprised of three primary components training and detrending detection and isolation a flow chart summarizing the method is shown in fig 1 which is described in the remainder of this section 2 1 training and detrending prior to monitoring we must identify the response variables or the variables in the system that we wish to monitor and predictor variables which can explain some of the variability in the response variables we denote the p response variables and q predictor variables observed at time t as column vectors x t and w t respectively the first τ observations which are known to be ic are used as an initial training window numerous methods known as phase i methods exist to identify an appropriate ic data set for training estimate parameters and set thresholds 47 49 and these are used in real time monitoring schemes known as phase ii methods however phase i methods make many of the same assumptions about the data as phase ii methods do and are therefore not appropriate for wwt data instead to identify an ic period we rely on the expertise of operators and other subject matter experts occasional outliers are common due to electrical surges in one or more sensors so to account for any such extreme values we linearly interpolate any observations in which at least one of the values exceeds 10 standard deviations of the median value in the training set in the three case studies zero observations were imputed for case study 1 two were imputed for case study 2 and one was imputed for case study 3 prior to monitoring we detrend the response variables using the predictor variables to account for any variability in the system from known sources such as system state control settings or other external factors that are not indicative of a fault multi state methods such as odom et al 33 have also been proposed but a detrending approach provides greater flexibility in the sources of variability that can be accounted for in the model for the i th response variable at time t which we denote x t i we fit a linear model 1 e x t i β 0 i w t t β 1 i t 1 2 τ using the training window of observations where β 0 i and β 1 i are the intercept and regression coefficients respectively of the linear model for the i th response variable using the fitted model we can find the fitted value x ˆ t i β ˆ 0 i w t t β ˆ 1 i for the i th response variable at time t where β ˆ 0 i and β ˆ 1 i are the estimated intercept and regression coefficients respectively the residuals for the i th variable r t i x t i x ˆ t i contain information about the behavior of the process that is not accounted for by other factors we can collect the residuals for all variables at time t into a single vector r t vec r t 1 r t 2 r t p which we monitor for faults using a method known as adaptive dynamic pca ad pca described in kazor et al 30 2 2 detection pca is a common technique used in mspm to reduce the dimension of the data while retaining as much information as possible two modifications adaptive and dynamic have been proposed to account for nonstationarity and autocorrelation respectively the adaptive extension of pca regularly updates the training window to account for nonstationarity in the data over time 50 51 in this case the adjustment allows us to account for nonstationarity due to long term or seasonal trends that remain after the effects of the predictor variables have been removed to use the dynamic extension of pca we augment r t with a lagged version of the residuals which we denote r t 52 for each variable we use the lag with the highest partial autocorrelation function from the training window so r t is of length 2 p when applied to nonlinearly related variables kazor et al 30 demonstrate through a simulation study of autocorrelated and nonstationary data that ad pca outperforms pca in terms of the false alarm rate under ic conditions and detection speed under oc conditions applying pca to the correlation matrix of the residuals from the training window r 1 r 2 r τ we obtain a 2 p k linear projection matrix p k with associated eigenvalues λ k diag λ 1 λ k where k is the number of pcs necessary to capture 80 of the variability therefore an observation projected into the pc subspace is y t p k t r t for each observation in the training period we calculate two monitoring statistics hotelling s t 2 and squared prediction error spe which we denote as q hotelling s t 2 is calculated as t 2 y t t λ k 1 y t r t t p k λ k 1 p k t r t which measures the variability in the pc subspace the squared prediction error spe measures the variability in the residual subspace and is calculated as q i p k p k t r t 2 where i is the 2 p 2 p identity matrix then we can estimate the ic distribution and determine thresholds of t 2 and q based on a pre specified false alarm rate α the use of parametric thresholds is popular among practitioners 5 but they can be highly affected by deviations from normality therefore if the underlying process distribution is not known sufficiently to assume normality nonparametric adjustments are recommended 53 we identify the nonparametric thresholds using the 1 α quantile of the kernel density estimate kde of t 2 and q from the training period given a new observation x t for t τ 1 we calculate the residuals based on the ic fitted model from eq 1 incorporate lagged values to produce r t map r t into the lower dimensional subspace y t and compute t 2 and q if either statistic exceeds the corresponding threshold we flag the observation as oc and perform fi otherwise we continue to monitor new observations using the adaptive version of pca we retain the observations classified as ic by ad pca and update the training window when we obtain κ new ic observations removing the oldest κ observations from the training window each time we update the training window we 1 re estimate p fitted models to calculate the residuals for each variable 2 re estimate p k and λ k and 3 re calculate the nonparametric thresholds for the monitoring statistics t 2 and q 2 3 isolation when an observation is flagged as oc we want to identify which of the variables means have shifted the residuals from the training window are of mean zero so identifying the shifted variables is equivalent to identifying the non zero components of the mean of r t which we denote μ t the method proposed by ebrahimi et al 28 recovers μ t from the pcs however in order to isolate the non zero components of the mean of r t rather than r t we re estimate the pcs as a function of r t given the entire linear projection matrix p p with associated eigenvalues λ p diag λ 1 λ p the pc score is y t p p t r t p p t μ t ϵ where ϵ is the error term with mean zero and covariance λ p to avoid any issues of non constant variance across the pcs we transform y t and p p as y t λ p 1 2 y t and p p λ p 1 2 p p then an estimate of the mean of the oc process is found using adaptive lasso which enforces sparsity in μ ˆ t by putting a penalty on the components of μ ˆ t and driving small components to zero an estimate of μ ˆ t is given by μ ˆ t arg min μ t y t p p t μ t 2 2 γ j 1 p w j μ j where γ is a regularization parameter and w vec w 1 w p 1 μ ˆ t ols we solve this using the r package glmnet 54 where the regularization parameter γ is chosen using cross validation all variables with non zero components of μ ˆ t are classified as shifted at time t all variables with zero components of μ ˆ t are classified as unshifted at time t we refer to this fd i method as adaptive dynamic sparse pca or ads pca because we are enforcing sparsity in the components of μ ˆ t 3 case studies we demonstrate the performance of ads pca by applying it to three known faults from mines park water reclamation test site mines park a demonstration scale decentralized wwt facility in golden colorado usa the facility treats approximately 7000 gallons of municipal wastewater daily from a university student apartment complex on the campus of colorado school of mines mines this facility has been used as a case study to develop and study mspm methods 30 31 33 35 42 3 1 mines park system description the system at mines park is a sequencing batch membrane bioreactor sb mbr which uses a combination of physical chemical and biological processes to treat municipal wastewater there are two major subsystems the two bioreactors brs and two membrane bioreactors mbrs which are connected by the return activated sludge ras and the mbr overflow a diagram of the two subsystems is shown in fig 2 wastewater is diverted from the municipal sewer system to a holding tank then once an hour a batch of raw wastewater is delivered to one of two brs using a submerged grinder pump and a 2 mm fine screen to remove large inert solids the carbon and nutrient rich wastewater is digested by the dense microbial mass in the brs known as activated sludge to activate particular microorganisms to degrade specific contaminants oxygen is provided via industrial air blowers these air blowers are timed strategically to efficiently transform organic and inorganic nitrogen into nitrogen gas and phosphorus into microbial biomass thus removing the nutrients from the water when the blowers are on dissolved oxygen do sensors measure the concentration of aqueous oxygen and a proportional integral controller increases or decreases the air blower speed to maintain a do concentration setpoint after an hour of alternating aeration conditions i e aerobic anaerobic a ras pump circulates the activated sludge between one of the brs and the two mbrs operating in parallel the activated sludge flows from the bottom of the fully mixed mbr tanks upward and overflows to a trough where the activated sludge is returned to the original br the mbr achieves solid liquid separation of the activated sludge using hollow fiber membranes with a nominal pore size of 0 03 μ m rejecting bacteria and some viruses aeration is provided to the mbrs to mix the activated sludge and to scour the solids that may accumulate on the membrane surface a pump pulls water through the membrane known as permeate to a holding tank where it will overflow to a second larger basin for subsequent reuse the two brs alternate between filling aeration and recirculating to provide a continuous flow of activated sludge to the mbrs and consequently a continuous flow of permeate the faults observed at mines park derive from two primary sources operational or environmental faults due to operational failures such as a clog in a pipe or equipment malfunction can propagate quickly throughout the system and evidence of these problems are associated with changes in the behavior of variables such as flow rates and equipment speed operational faults require immediate corrective action and can result in system downtime in which either no water can pass through the system or water passes through under treated however operational faults are usually short lived and can be addressed with sufficient labor hours tools and equipment faults caused by environmental changes can have more long lasting and severe consequences but are slower to impact system variables because influent water is heavily diluted by water already in the system regardless the microorganisms responsible for treating the wastewater are sensitive to the environmental conditions of the brs so even slight changes in water quality can threaten their survival diagnosing an environmental fault is difficult because regulated water quality measurements are only taken a few times a week and once a change has been identified in these measurements the biological system has already been compromised and requires supplemental chemical addition or drastic operational changes to recover 3 2 data description and detrending more than 30 variables are recorded every minute in the mines park sb mbr using sensors placed throughout the system which are denoted by colored rectangles in fig 2 first we identify the set of response variables that we wish to monitor and the corresponding predictor variables needed to detrend the response variables information on the system s state and control settings known as control variables are recorded every minute and these can explain some variability in the behavior of the response variables for example if a blower s air flow rate increases it is expected that the do concentration in the br will increase as well often there is a delay in the effect of a control variable on a response variable so we account for this delay by using lagged versions of the control variables in the fitted regression models given in eq 1 using the partial cross correlation function pccf between the control and response variable we select the lag with the largest pccf value based on exploratory data analysis we also identified an hourly two hour and daily trend in the observations so we include cyclic variables in the form of sine cosine pairs with a corresponding period to account for these temporal frequencies together the control variables lagged control variables and cyclic variables make up the set of predictor variables used for detrending the operation of the two subsystems br and mbr at a given time are semi independent over time they become dependent if a fault goes undetected and propagates throughout the entire system but there is a delay in the impact to the other subsystem therefore we monitor the response variables from the two subsystems separately and include the ras related variables in both data sets we monitor 11 variables in the br subsystem and 16 variables in the mbr subsystem for some response variables we found that including control variables from both subsystems substantially increased the predictive power of the model so we include the control variables from both subsystems to model all response variables a list of all response control and cyclic variables is included in the supplementary materials for ads pca we use a training window of τ 7200 observations or five days of observations monitored every minute we update the model every κ 1440 observations which is equivalent to one day of observations assuming every observation is classified as ic we must also specify the false alarm rate α which determines the thresholds for the monitoring statistics a larger α will result in a smaller threshold so faults will be detected sooner but there will also be more false alarms we set the false alarm rate to be α 0 005 which means that when the process is ic we can expect a false alarm every 200 observations on average which translates to one false alarm every 3 h and 20 min for each response variable we fit a linear model using adaptive lasso 55 which performs parameter estimation and variable selection simultaneously to remove some of the unimportant predictor variables from the model lasso regression methods are sensitive to differences in scale among variables so prior to model fitting we standardize the predictor and response variables from the training period an example of the fitted models using a heat map to show the estimated regression coefficients is included in the supplementary materials fig 3 shows an example of the detrending process for sewage level one of the shifted variables from case study 3 a time series plot of sewage level is shown in fig 3 a with the observed values in black and fitted values in red and the residuals are shown in black in fig 3 b the green vertical lines in both plots indicate when the model is updated where the first five days of observations are the initial training window a fluctuation in the mean of sewage level is evident over time even throughout the training period the fitted model is able to capture some of the nonstationarity with an r 2 of 30 during the initial training window reducing the variability in the residuals on january 29 there is a dramatic decrease in sewage level which is not captured by the fitted model and is therefore preserved for detection by ads pca for these case studies we present an enhanced visualization technique called a checkerboard plot which summarizes when faults are detected which response variables are shifted for each oc observation and in which direction the shift occurred for each variable simultaneously this provides an easy and concise way to communicate the health of the system to operators in real time using this information operators can then refer to the individual time series plots to diagnose and assess the severity of the fault variations of checkerboard plots have been used to visualize fd i results 19 56 but to our knowledge none have used color to indicate the direction of the fault including the direction of the fault makes it much easier for an operator to diagnose the fault for example a downward shift in the concentration of total suspended solids tss could indicate an environmental fault in which the biomass is decaying faster than it is growing however an upward shift in tss could indicate an operational fault such as a valve stuck in the closed position causing activated sludge to continuously accumulate in the system the checkerboard plots for the three case studies are shown in figs 4 5 and 7 each row represents a response variable over time and the shifted variables that were identified by the operators retrospectively are highlighted in yellow at each time point a white box indicates that the variable is classified as unshifted a red box indicates that the variable has an upward shift detected and a blue box indicates that the variable has a downward shift detected the color gets darker as the number of consecutive alarms increases using a gradient color scale the lightest blue indicates only a single alarm and the darkest blue indicates that at least five alarms in a row have occurred note that zooming into figs 4 5 and 7 will provide greater resolution and detail in the plots case studies 1 and 2 have two checkerboard plots one for each of the two subsystems case study 3 only has one checkerboard plot for the br subsystem and we will elaborate further in section 3 5 3 3 case study 1 the first case study focuses on a fault at the end of december 2017 in which the system suffered from an operational fault and an environmental fault simultaneously that affected both the br and mbr subsystems the training window for case study 1 is december 17 21 2017 followed by a monitoring period from december 22 25 2017 first we focus on the fault in the br subsystem in mid december 2017 students at mines finished taking final exams and most left campus for the holiday break which is a common situation for decentralized wwt facilities that serve seasonal communities as a result the hourly wastewater flow to replenish the sewage tank declined and over the following week the sewage level began to drop which is detected by the method beginning on december 22 as seen in fig 4 a these low flow conditions were compounded by a change in water quality the wastewater was not only less concentrated but the longer retention times in the collection system most likely led to preemptive carbon degradation the carbon concentration of the raw wastewater is directly related to the oxygen demand which is how much oxygen is required to fully treat the water of all oxidizeable material at mines park ic water quality conditions usually require almost a full hour of the air blowers at 100 speed to reach a do concentration of 2 mg l however during the monitoring period when the blowers were turned on every 10 20 min the little remaining carbon was quickly oxidized and the do concentration setpoint was easily achieved and in some cases exceeded this increase relative to ic conditions is evident in the intermittent upward shifts detected in bio 1 do and bio 2 do the shifts in bio 1 temp bio 2 temp and ras temp are most likely false alarms due to the nonstationarity of the temperature variables which is still present and not fully removed from the residuals the downward shifts in ras ph are also likely false alarms because the sensor for the ph concentration rounds the value to two significant digits resulting in only four unique values observed over the course of the five day training period with so little variability in ras ph the fi method tends to classify the variable as shifted when it deviates from the most common observed value in the training period one day after the fault is detected by the method in the brs a fault is also detected in the mbrs which is shown in fig 4 b mid day on december 23 a clog developed in the inlet to mbr 1 causing a decrease in the mbr 1 inf flow because the flow from the ras pump splits into the two mbrs the clog to mbr 1 caused a corresponding increase in the mbr 2 inf flow the decreased flow to mbr 1 and increased flow to mbr 2 resulted in a concentration and dilution of solids in mbr 1 and 2 respectively which caused an increase in mbr 1 tss and decrease in mbr 2 tss a few hours later the low mbr 1 inf flow caused a drop in the mbr 1 level so very little if any water was overflowing into the trough that returns the activated sludge into the brs therefore the only activated sludge returned to the brs was from mbr 2 which had been diluted by the increased flow rate resulting in a decrease in ras tss as well which is detected in both subsystems before the end of the day on december 23 when the low mbr 1 influent flow rate alarmed i e fell below an operator determined threshold the operator artificially increased the flow to mbr 1 by exercising the valve where the clog was most likely located restricting the flow to mbr 2 and increasing the pressure head on the ras pump by increasing br levels this dislodged the clog and subsequently equalized the distribution of solids in the mbrs as a result the tss concentration of the mbrs and ras returned to normal operating conditions after temporary operational changes 3 4 case study 2 the training window for case study 2 begins shortly after the conclusion of the monitoring period for case study 1 and covers the period from december 30 2017 to january 3 2018 which is followed by a four day monitoring period the fault of interest occurred exclusively in the mbr but we present the results from ads pca in the br as well to demonstrate the importance of the choice of the ic training period on the results the ads pca results for case study 2 are shown in fig 5 the fault in the br from case study 1 was not detected or corrected by operators at the time so it carries over into the training and monitoring period for case study 2 fig 6 illustrates this behavior for bio 1 do and both bio 2 do and sewage level exhibit similar patterns in the training window for case study 1 which is represented by the left green region bio 1 do is truly ic but becomes oc towards the end of the training period when bio 1 do continues to increase during the monitoring period of case study 1 the left blue region the observations are flagged as oc by ads pca the fault was not detected by operators in the br so we used our method with a training window that contained oc data in case study 2 the right green region as a result fig 5 a shows that our method does not flag any observations as oc during the monitoring period of case study 2 the right blue region because the oc behavior in these variables is now considered to be ic by the method this is to be expected given that the method is purely data driven there is also oc behavior present in the training window for the mbr that was initially overlooked by operators around january 4 the beginning of the monitoring period full time operators returned to campus from the holidays and identified a decrease in perm turbidity due to an equipment failure that had gone unrepaired over the break following a manual adjustment the perm turbidity increased to normal operating conditions because the method trains on oc data for perm turbidity the method flags ic perm turbidity data as oc as seen in fig 5 b nevertheless operators believe the oc behavior was isolated to perm turbidity so the fi results for other variables are still reliable and provide insight into the true cause of the fault in the mbr a clog initially caused by hair which is not completely removed by the 2 mm fine screen and is not digested by microorganisms grew in the ras pump and this is detected by ads pca late in the evening on january 4 the clog caused a slow decrease in the mbr influent flow resulting in an initially intermittent shift and transitioning to a persistent downward shift detected in mbr 1 inf flow and mbr 2 inf flow additionally the low strength of the wastewater due to the absence of students over the holidays led to a decline in biomass which resulted in a decrease in mbr 1 tss mbr 2 tss and ras tss the downward shift in perm conductivity detected at the beginning of january 5 was a result of a sensor fault the changes in the influent flow caused by the clog were very gradual and occurred over the course of multiple days so this fault was a long slow drift as a result the method only intermittently detects the downward shift in influent flow on january 4 and 5 but by january 6 the shift is consistently flagged in comparison in the absence of a real time fi method the clog went undiagnosed by operators for almost three weeks and was finally corrected on january 25 therefore this method would have identified the fault in the influent flow almost three weeks sooner than the operators did which could have improved system performance and stability the detection of the downward shift in tss would have also pointed operators to a change in environmental pressures which would have allowed them to alter the operating conditions to buffer against the decline 3 5 case study 3 the training window for case study 3 is january 23 27 2018 followed by a two and a half day monitoring window the fault in the mbr discussed in case study 2 was not corrected until january 25 so the training window for the mbr is not truly ic therefore we focus solely on the br which is where the fault occurred for case study 3 on january 29 a clog occurred in the raw wastewater diversion feeding the holding tank which feeds the sb mbr causing the sewage level to drop this exposed the submerged pump responsible for feeding the sb mbr causing it to overheat and shut down as a result raw wastewater was not delivered to the brs causing the br levels to decrease which is evident in the downward shifts detected in bio 1 level and bio 2 level see fig 7 mid day on january 29 without additional wastewater there was no carbon or nutrients present to oxidize or provide microbial growth consequently similar to case study 1 the do concentrations immediately reached the setpoint without any readily oxidizeable material to consume the do provided by the air blowers which is consistent with a shift up in bio 1 do and bio 2 do detected by ads pca operators were alerted to the problem when bio 1 level and bio 2 level dropped below their pre specified threshold had the fault been detected sooner the pump may not have been exposed which would have prevented permanent equipment damage during the fault event no wastewater could be treated for a facility with limited holding capacity this would have been detrimental and would have led to untreated water being discharged to the environment this fault could have easily been avoided with the installation of a more stringent level or level decline rate alarm but the sensor was not accurately calibrated at the time of the fault and the thresholds were not trusted by operators given the design of the system at the time of the fault these results illustrate the power of a data driven fd method to inexpensively complement existing wwt control systems and prevent severe consequences of simple faults 4 discussion when incorporating a fd i monitoring scheme into a wwt control system it is important to remember that mspm methods are purely data driven even if the method performs as expected it is possible for the results to be misleading or inconsistent with an operator s assessment of the fault for example the temperature variables were frequently flagged as shifted even when upon further inspection by operators the shifts were not substantial or were of no consequence these false alarms were a result of a poor fit for the trend in eq 1 that resulted in nonstationarity in the residuals leading to a shift detected in the mean when the temperatures increased or decreased secondly ads pca is very sensitive to the choice of the training data set as highlighted in case study 2 if a data set with oc behavior is used to train the model the monitoring scheme may flag ic data as oc therefore it is imperative that operators and system experts thoroughly analyze the training data set prior to monitoring additionally it is advisable to reset the monitoring scheme after a fault is detected diagnosed and corrected to ensure that the training window is not contaminated with observations from the oc period that were incorrectly classified as ic which is especially common for long slow drift faults in spite of some of the inherent limitations of ads pca it is able to account for changes in operating conditions by removing the effect of control settings influent changes and external factors on the monitored variables via the adaptive lasso linear regression the general framework used for detrending makes this method very flexible for a variety of system configurations because lasso regression performs variable selection and parameter estimation simultaneously it allows the user to include a multitude of predictor variables in the model without extensive model development or prior knowledge of the relationship between each response and predictor variable this method can also accommodate stationary data by simply monitoring the standardized response variables rather than constructing a set of linear models and monitoring the residuals ads pca is the first fully functional fd i approach that can be used for wwt processes in real time and the approach can also be applied in other complex settings where nonstationarity temporal dependence and non normality are present in the data this method is particularly important for facilities of communities with limited means that might have outdated control systems instead of inspecting time series plots for each individual variable which can lead to missed detection and delays in fault diagnosis checkerboard plots allow operators to monitor all variables in the system simultaneously they can be a very useful tool for operators to gain insight into the particular variables that are shifted we demonstrate the utility of our approach in three complex fault settings at a decentralized wwt facility by comparing the operators post hoc analysis of the faults along with their response in real time with the insight provided by ads pca and the checkerboard plots which confirms that our approach would have facilitated a more rapid detection and diagnosis had it been implemented in real time without our fully integrated approach operators are limited by the knowledge that a single variable is outside of the operator determined thresholds that distinguish ic verses oc conditions ads pca and the checkerboard plots are intended to complement the expertise of wwt operators by synthesizing the wealth of data collected in wwt systems narrowing their focus to specific components of the system that require attention and facilitating more rapid fault diagnosis in a multivariate system authors contribution molly c klanderman methodology

13792,decentralized wastewater treatment wwt can be an energy and resource efficient alternative to the traditional centralized wwt paradigm for water stressed communities however to operate economically decentralized facilities do not typically have a wwt operator on site full time so a real time monitoring scheme is needed to quickly detect system faults and isolate the features associated with or affected by faults to ensure adequate treated water quality data collected from wwt facilities exhibit temporal dependence and experience natural fluctuations in the mean due to environmental and operator controlled factors violating the assumptions of many existing fault detection and isolation fd i methods to address this we develop a complete data driven fd i method tuned to handle the unique features of wwt data that can be run in real time and illustrate how it performs with data from a decentralized wwt facility in golden colorado usa enhanced visualization techniques are designed to assist operators in identifying features associated with the fault we present three case studies with known faults and demonstrate how this method can aid operators in detecting and diagnosing the cause of a fault more quickly keywords fault detection fault isolation lasso pca wastewater treatment 1 introduction in the traditional water management paradigm municipal and industrial wastewater is collected and conveyed to centralized wastewater treatment wwt facilities for removal of contaminants before discharge to the environment e g rivers lakes however the demand for additional water resources in arid or water stressed regions makes decentralized wwt systems an attractive option in decentralized wwt systems wastewater is treated close to the point of generation which allows the treated water to be reused locally treatment can even be tailored to provide water of different qualities for various reuse applications such as toilet flushing or irrigation not only can this new paradigm provide an additional water source for a community s water portfolio but it is also more resource and energy efficient because it does not require pumping wastewater over long distances for collection and distribution 1 3 the major drawback of decentralized wwt is that these smaller facilities have higher operating expenses it is often not feasible for decentralized facilities to have an operator on site twenty four hours a day to monitor system operations however without operator oversight faults can quickly propagate through the system which can have serious operational financial environmental or public health implications thus a fault monitoring platform is needed that would allow one operator to simultaneously monitor multiple facilities remotely fault detection fd is the detection of abnormal system behavior or behavior that deviates from accepted in control ic conditions in a high dimensional setting like wwt in which dozens of process variables are monitored knowledge of the presence of out of control oc conditions is not completely informative it is also important to identify the variables within the system that have shifted known as fault isolation fi then operators are well equipped to begin diagnosing the fault and correcting it newhart et al 4 summarize the existing monitoring paradigms used in the majority of wwt facilities and emphasize the need for more advanced data driven monitoring strategies tailored for wwt the most common process control approach in wwt is to identify an acceptable for each monitored variable and when the value exceeds a threshold the variable is identified as oc and an alarm is triggered however static univariate thresholds tend to detect faults slowly because they do not account for the relationship among variables within the system 4 typically after an alarm is triggered by one variable in the system operators attempt to identify other variables affected by the fault in order to diagnose the cause this course of action includes visually interpreting time series plots of the individual variables even for highly skilled operators who are familiar with the system it is difficult to visually identify the affected variables among many especially for faults that increase in magnitude and severity slowly over time therefore an advanced real time monitoring strategy is required to detect faults in a wwt system and identify the components associated with the fault a wealth of statistical literature exists for fd and fi collectively referred to as multivariate statistical process monitoring mspm review papers by woodall and montgomery 5 and reis and gins 6 provide a good overview of the current methods and problems in the field control charts such as the multivariate exponentially weighted moving average mewma chart 7 hotelling s t 2 chart 8 and multivariate cumulative sum mcusum chart 9 remain popular fd methods among practitioners and many variations and improvements have been proposed e g 10 15 common fi methods include contribution plots variable thinning methods and post signal diagnostic variable selection methods contribution plots visualize the contribution of each variable to the fault but the contribution of one variable can propagate to other variables known as the smearing effect which can lead to misdiagnosis 16 an alternative to contribution plots that reduces the smearing effect is reconstruction based contribution rbc 17 19 but rbc can still result in misdiagnosis in complex fault settings in which multiple variables are affected variable thinning methods focus on thinning or reducing the number of variables prior to monitoring in order to have more power in detecting the fault 20 25 alternatively some methods monitor all variables and after a fault is detected variable selection approaches such as forward selection and lasso estimation are used to identify the shifted variables 26 29 most fault detection and isolation fd i methods require an assumption that the data are independent and identically distributed many also require a distributional assumption such as multivariate normality data collected from decentralized wwt facilities violate these assumptions making most mspm methods inappropriate for direct application influent is more highly variable in quality and quantity than that of centralized facilities resulting in a natural fluctuation in variables over the course of the day week and season which causes nonstationarity in the mean furthermore changes in operational settings such as flow rates or whether a valve is open or closed can impact monitored variables and these changes are not indicative of a fault because the data are collected at a high frequency e g seconds to minutes the data have a strong positive autocorrelation present finally the data often do not follow a normal distribution and may exhibit some skewness because of the nonstationarity autocorrelation and non normality present in wwt facility data it can be especially challenging to detect faults ignoring these characteristics can result in a high false alarm rate which can be costly in terms of time and money for a decentralized wwt facility using data to then isolate the shifted variables can be even more challenging fd in wwt settings with real data has been addressed in a few papers e g 30 35 but it is much more common to use artificial simulated data from models such as the benchmark simulation model e g 36 40 when real data are used often only a small subset of the monitored variables less than 10 are considered which artificially reduces the complexity and difficulty of monitoring in this setting 31 32 34 35 41 kazor et al 30 and odom et al 33 developed advanced real time fd methods that were able to effectively monitor more than 25 variables however fi has never been applied to wwt processes outside of klanderman et al 42 who proposed a retrospective fi method using fused lasso to identify shifted variables in a period of historical data so this is the first time wherein real time fi has been tested in a wwt setting in this paper we present a fully integrated real time fd i method that accounts for nonstationarity autocorrelation and non normality all of which are present in wwt data first we account for nonstationarity by removing any trends due to environmental or operational factors which is a common approach among practitioners 42 46 then we apply an fd method based on principal component analysis pca proposed by kazor et al 30 to the detrended data which can account for temporal dependence non normality and nonstationarity caused by long term or seasonal trends not captured in the detrending process for fi we apply the post signal diagnostic variable selection method proposed by ebrahimi et al 28 which uses adaptive lasso to recover the shifted variables from the principal components pcs using three case studies from a demonstration scale decentralized wwt facility we illustrate the method s performance through an enhanced visualization tool that we design to assist operators in the fault diagnosis step we compare the results of the method with the operators post hoc analysis of the fault to see how quickly the method detects the fault which variables are identified as shifted and if the analysis can provide any additional insight into the fault the major contributions of our work are 1 the integration of fd and fi for a fully functional fd i methodology 2 the development of an enhanced visualization tool to assist with diagnosis and 3 the illustration of the method with real and complex cases the approach that we develop is tailored to the unique features of decentralized wwt data and is the first time that an fd i approach has been applied to such a complex system but the methodology is flexible enough to be applied in other fields of application section 2 introduces the real time fd i method section 3 presents three case studies with known faults from a wwt facility in golden colorado usa and section 4 discusses the capabilities and limitations of the method when considering applying it to similar systems 2 methodology the method is comprised of three primary components training and detrending detection and isolation a flow chart summarizing the method is shown in fig 1 which is described in the remainder of this section 2 1 training and detrending prior to monitoring we must identify the response variables or the variables in the system that we wish to monitor and predictor variables which can explain some of the variability in the response variables we denote the p response variables and q predictor variables observed at time t as column vectors x t and w t respectively the first τ observations which are known to be ic are used as an initial training window numerous methods known as phase i methods exist to identify an appropriate ic data set for training estimate parameters and set thresholds 47 49 and these are used in real time monitoring schemes known as phase ii methods however phase i methods make many of the same assumptions about the data as phase ii methods do and are therefore not appropriate for wwt data instead to identify an ic period we rely on the expertise of operators and other subject matter experts occasional outliers are common due to electrical surges in one or more sensors so to account for any such extreme values we linearly interpolate any observations in which at least one of the values exceeds 10 standard deviations of the median value in the training set in the three case studies zero observations were imputed for case study 1 two were imputed for case study 2 and one was imputed for case study 3 prior to monitoring we detrend the response variables using the predictor variables to account for any variability in the system from known sources such as system state control settings or other external factors that are not indicative of a fault multi state methods such as odom et al 33 have also been proposed but a detrending approach provides greater flexibility in the sources of variability that can be accounted for in the model for the i th response variable at time t which we denote x t i we fit a linear model 1 e x t i β 0 i w t t β 1 i t 1 2 τ using the training window of observations where β 0 i and β 1 i are the intercept and regression coefficients respectively of the linear model for the i th response variable using the fitted model we can find the fitted value x ˆ t i β ˆ 0 i w t t β ˆ 1 i for the i th response variable at time t where β ˆ 0 i and β ˆ 1 i are the estimated intercept and regression coefficients respectively the residuals for the i th variable r t i x t i x ˆ t i contain information about the behavior of the process that is not accounted for by other factors we can collect the residuals for all variables at time t into a single vector r t vec r t 1 r t 2 r t p which we monitor for faults using a method known as adaptive dynamic pca ad pca described in kazor et al 30 2 2 detection pca is a common technique used in mspm to reduce the dimension of the data while retaining as much information as possible two modifications adaptive and dynamic have been proposed to account for nonstationarity and autocorrelation respectively the adaptive extension of pca regularly updates the training window to account for nonstationarity in the data over time 50 51 in this case the adjustment allows us to account for nonstationarity due to long term or seasonal trends that remain after the effects of the predictor variables have been removed to use the dynamic extension of pca we augment r t with a lagged version of the residuals which we denote r t 52 for each variable we use the lag with the highest partial autocorrelation function from the training window so r t is of length 2 p when applied to nonlinearly related variables kazor et al 30 demonstrate through a simulation study of autocorrelated and nonstationary data that ad pca outperforms pca in terms of the false alarm rate under ic conditions and detection speed under oc conditions applying pca to the correlation matrix of the residuals from the training window r 1 r 2 r τ we obtain a 2 p k linear projection matrix p k with associated eigenvalues λ k diag λ 1 λ k where k is the number of pcs necessary to capture 80 of the variability therefore an observation projected into the pc subspace is y t p k t r t for each observation in the training period we calculate two monitoring statistics hotelling s t 2 and squared prediction error spe which we denote as q hotelling s t 2 is calculated as t 2 y t t λ k 1 y t r t t p k λ k 1 p k t r t which measures the variability in the pc subspace the squared prediction error spe measures the variability in the residual subspace and is calculated as q i p k p k t r t 2 where i is the 2 p 2 p identity matrix then we can estimate the ic distribution and determine thresholds of t 2 and q based on a pre specified false alarm rate α the use of parametric thresholds is popular among practitioners 5 but they can be highly affected by deviations from normality therefore if the underlying process distribution is not known sufficiently to assume normality nonparametric adjustments are recommended 53 we identify the nonparametric thresholds using the 1 α quantile of the kernel density estimate kde of t 2 and q from the training period given a new observation x t for t τ 1 we calculate the residuals based on the ic fitted model from eq 1 incorporate lagged values to produce r t map r t into the lower dimensional subspace y t and compute t 2 and q if either statistic exceeds the corresponding threshold we flag the observation as oc and perform fi otherwise we continue to monitor new observations using the adaptive version of pca we retain the observations classified as ic by ad pca and update the training window when we obtain κ new ic observations removing the oldest κ observations from the training window each time we update the training window we 1 re estimate p fitted models to calculate the residuals for each variable 2 re estimate p k and λ k and 3 re calculate the nonparametric thresholds for the monitoring statistics t 2 and q 2 3 isolation when an observation is flagged as oc we want to identify which of the variables means have shifted the residuals from the training window are of mean zero so identifying the shifted variables is equivalent to identifying the non zero components of the mean of r t which we denote μ t the method proposed by ebrahimi et al 28 recovers μ t from the pcs however in order to isolate the non zero components of the mean of r t rather than r t we re estimate the pcs as a function of r t given the entire linear projection matrix p p with associated eigenvalues λ p diag λ 1 λ p the pc score is y t p p t r t p p t μ t ϵ where ϵ is the error term with mean zero and covariance λ p to avoid any issues of non constant variance across the pcs we transform y t and p p as y t λ p 1 2 y t and p p λ p 1 2 p p then an estimate of the mean of the oc process is found using adaptive lasso which enforces sparsity in μ ˆ t by putting a penalty on the components of μ ˆ t and driving small components to zero an estimate of μ ˆ t is given by μ ˆ t arg min μ t y t p p t μ t 2 2 γ j 1 p w j μ j where γ is a regularization parameter and w vec w 1 w p 1 μ ˆ t ols we solve this using the r package glmnet 54 where the regularization parameter γ is chosen using cross validation all variables with non zero components of μ ˆ t are classified as shifted at time t all variables with zero components of μ ˆ t are classified as unshifted at time t we refer to this fd i method as adaptive dynamic sparse pca or ads pca because we are enforcing sparsity in the components of μ ˆ t 3 case studies we demonstrate the performance of ads pca by applying it to three known faults from mines park water reclamation test site mines park a demonstration scale decentralized wwt facility in golden colorado usa the facility treats approximately 7000 gallons of municipal wastewater daily from a university student apartment complex on the campus of colorado school of mines mines this facility has been used as a case study to develop and study mspm methods 30 31 33 35 42 3 1 mines park system description the system at mines park is a sequencing batch membrane bioreactor sb mbr which uses a combination of physical chemical and biological processes to treat municipal wastewater there are two major subsystems the two bioreactors brs and two membrane bioreactors mbrs which are connected by the return activated sludge ras and the mbr overflow a diagram of the two subsystems is shown in fig 2 wastewater is diverted from the municipal sewer system to a holding tank then once an hour a batch of raw wastewater is delivered to one of two brs using a submerged grinder pump and a 2 mm fine screen to remove large inert solids the carbon and nutrient rich wastewater is digested by the dense microbial mass in the brs known as activated sludge to activate particular microorganisms to degrade specific contaminants oxygen is provided via industrial air blowers these air blowers are timed strategically to efficiently transform organic and inorganic nitrogen into nitrogen gas and phosphorus into microbial biomass thus removing the nutrients from the water when the blowers are on dissolved oxygen do sensors measure the concentration of aqueous oxygen and a proportional integral controller increases or decreases the air blower speed to maintain a do concentration setpoint after an hour of alternating aeration conditions i e aerobic anaerobic a ras pump circulates the activated sludge between one of the brs and the two mbrs operating in parallel the activated sludge flows from the bottom of the fully mixed mbr tanks upward and overflows to a trough where the activated sludge is returned to the original br the mbr achieves solid liquid separation of the activated sludge using hollow fiber membranes with a nominal pore size of 0 03 μ m rejecting bacteria and some viruses aeration is provided to the mbrs to mix the activated sludge and to scour the solids that may accumulate on the membrane surface a pump pulls water through the membrane known as permeate to a holding tank where it will overflow to a second larger basin for subsequent reuse the two brs alternate between filling aeration and recirculating to provide a continuous flow of activated sludge to the mbrs and consequently a continuous flow of permeate the faults observed at mines park derive from two primary sources operational or environmental faults due to operational failures such as a clog in a pipe or equipment malfunction can propagate quickly throughout the system and evidence of these problems are associated with changes in the behavior of variables such as flow rates and equipment speed operational faults require immediate corrective action and can result in system downtime in which either no water can pass through the system or water passes through under treated however operational faults are usually short lived and can be addressed with sufficient labor hours tools and equipment faults caused by environmental changes can have more long lasting and severe consequences but are slower to impact system variables because influent water is heavily diluted by water already in the system regardless the microorganisms responsible for treating the wastewater are sensitive to the environmental conditions of the brs so even slight changes in water quality can threaten their survival diagnosing an environmental fault is difficult because regulated water quality measurements are only taken a few times a week and once a change has been identified in these measurements the biological system has already been compromised and requires supplemental chemical addition or drastic operational changes to recover 3 2 data description and detrending more than 30 variables are recorded every minute in the mines park sb mbr using sensors placed throughout the system which are denoted by colored rectangles in fig 2 first we identify the set of response variables that we wish to monitor and the corresponding predictor variables needed to detrend the response variables information on the system s state and control settings known as control variables are recorded every minute and these can explain some variability in the behavior of the response variables for example if a blower s air flow rate increases it is expected that the do concentration in the br will increase as well often there is a delay in the effect of a control variable on a response variable so we account for this delay by using lagged versions of the control variables in the fitted regression models given in eq 1 using the partial cross correlation function pccf between the control and response variable we select the lag with the largest pccf value based on exploratory data analysis we also identified an hourly two hour and daily trend in the observations so we include cyclic variables in the form of sine cosine pairs with a corresponding period to account for these temporal frequencies together the control variables lagged control variables and cyclic variables make up the set of predictor variables used for detrending the operation of the two subsystems br and mbr at a given time are semi independent over time they become dependent if a fault goes undetected and propagates throughout the entire system but there is a delay in the impact to the other subsystem therefore we monitor the response variables from the two subsystems separately and include the ras related variables in both data sets we monitor 11 variables in the br subsystem and 16 variables in the mbr subsystem for some response variables we found that including control variables from both subsystems substantially increased the predictive power of the model so we include the control variables from both subsystems to model all response variables a list of all response control and cyclic variables is included in the supplementary materials for ads pca we use a training window of τ 7200 observations or five days of observations monitored every minute we update the model every κ 1440 observations which is equivalent to one day of observations assuming every observation is classified as ic we must also specify the false alarm rate α which determines the thresholds for the monitoring statistics a larger α will result in a smaller threshold so faults will be detected sooner but there will also be more false alarms we set the false alarm rate to be α 0 005 which means that when the process is ic we can expect a false alarm every 200 observations on average which translates to one false alarm every 3 h and 20 min for each response variable we fit a linear model using adaptive lasso 55 which performs parameter estimation and variable selection simultaneously to remove some of the unimportant predictor variables from the model lasso regression methods are sensitive to differences in scale among variables so prior to model fitting we standardize the predictor and response variables from the training period an example of the fitted models using a heat map to show the estimated regression coefficients is included in the supplementary materials fig 3 shows an example of the detrending process for sewage level one of the shifted variables from case study 3 a time series plot of sewage level is shown in fig 3 a with the observed values in black and fitted values in red and the residuals are shown in black in fig 3 b the green vertical lines in both plots indicate when the model is updated where the first five days of observations are the initial training window a fluctuation in the mean of sewage level is evident over time even throughout the training period the fitted model is able to capture some of the nonstationarity with an r 2 of 30 during the initial training window reducing the variability in the residuals on january 29 there is a dramatic decrease in sewage level which is not captured by the fitted model and is therefore preserved for detection by ads pca for these case studies we present an enhanced visualization technique called a checkerboard plot which summarizes when faults are detected which response variables are shifted for each oc observation and in which direction the shift occurred for each variable simultaneously this provides an easy and concise way to communicate the health of the system to operators in real time using this information operators can then refer to the individual time series plots to diagnose and assess the severity of the fault variations of checkerboard plots have been used to visualize fd i results 19 56 but to our knowledge none have used color to indicate the direction of the fault including the direction of the fault makes it much easier for an operator to diagnose the fault for example a downward shift in the concentration of total suspended solids tss could indicate an environmental fault in which the biomass is decaying faster than it is growing however an upward shift in tss could indicate an operational fault such as a valve stuck in the closed position causing activated sludge to continuously accumulate in the system the checkerboard plots for the three case studies are shown in figs 4 5 and 7 each row represents a response variable over time and the shifted variables that were identified by the operators retrospectively are highlighted in yellow at each time point a white box indicates that the variable is classified as unshifted a red box indicates that the variable has an upward shift detected and a blue box indicates that the variable has a downward shift detected the color gets darker as the number of consecutive alarms increases using a gradient color scale the lightest blue indicates only a single alarm and the darkest blue indicates that at least five alarms in a row have occurred note that zooming into figs 4 5 and 7 will provide greater resolution and detail in the plots case studies 1 and 2 have two checkerboard plots one for each of the two subsystems case study 3 only has one checkerboard plot for the br subsystem and we will elaborate further in section 3 5 3 3 case study 1 the first case study focuses on a fault at the end of december 2017 in which the system suffered from an operational fault and an environmental fault simultaneously that affected both the br and mbr subsystems the training window for case study 1 is december 17 21 2017 followed by a monitoring period from december 22 25 2017 first we focus on the fault in the br subsystem in mid december 2017 students at mines finished taking final exams and most left campus for the holiday break which is a common situation for decentralized wwt facilities that serve seasonal communities as a result the hourly wastewater flow to replenish the sewage tank declined and over the following week the sewage level began to drop which is detected by the method beginning on december 22 as seen in fig 4 a these low flow conditions were compounded by a change in water quality the wastewater was not only less concentrated but the longer retention times in the collection system most likely led to preemptive carbon degradation the carbon concentration of the raw wastewater is directly related to the oxygen demand which is how much oxygen is required to fully treat the water of all oxidizeable material at mines park ic water quality conditions usually require almost a full hour of the air blowers at 100 speed to reach a do concentration of 2 mg l however during the monitoring period when the blowers were turned on every 10 20 min the little remaining carbon was quickly oxidized and the do concentration setpoint was easily achieved and in some cases exceeded this increase relative to ic conditions is evident in the intermittent upward shifts detected in bio 1 do and bio 2 do the shifts in bio 1 temp bio 2 temp and ras temp are most likely false alarms due to the nonstationarity of the temperature variables which is still present and not fully removed from the residuals the downward shifts in ras ph are also likely false alarms because the sensor for the ph concentration rounds the value to two significant digits resulting in only four unique values observed over the course of the five day training period with so little variability in ras ph the fi method tends to classify the variable as shifted when it deviates from the most common observed value in the training period one day after the fault is detected by the method in the brs a fault is also detected in the mbrs which is shown in fig 4 b mid day on december 23 a clog developed in the inlet to mbr 1 causing a decrease in the mbr 1 inf flow because the flow from the ras pump splits into the two mbrs the clog to mbr 1 caused a corresponding increase in the mbr 2 inf flow the decreased flow to mbr 1 and increased flow to mbr 2 resulted in a concentration and dilution of solids in mbr 1 and 2 respectively which caused an increase in mbr 1 tss and decrease in mbr 2 tss a few hours later the low mbr 1 inf flow caused a drop in the mbr 1 level so very little if any water was overflowing into the trough that returns the activated sludge into the brs therefore the only activated sludge returned to the brs was from mbr 2 which had been diluted by the increased flow rate resulting in a decrease in ras tss as well which is detected in both subsystems before the end of the day on december 23 when the low mbr 1 influent flow rate alarmed i e fell below an operator determined threshold the operator artificially increased the flow to mbr 1 by exercising the valve where the clog was most likely located restricting the flow to mbr 2 and increasing the pressure head on the ras pump by increasing br levels this dislodged the clog and subsequently equalized the distribution of solids in the mbrs as a result the tss concentration of the mbrs and ras returned to normal operating conditions after temporary operational changes 3 4 case study 2 the training window for case study 2 begins shortly after the conclusion of the monitoring period for case study 1 and covers the period from december 30 2017 to january 3 2018 which is followed by a four day monitoring period the fault of interest occurred exclusively in the mbr but we present the results from ads pca in the br as well to demonstrate the importance of the choice of the ic training period on the results the ads pca results for case study 2 are shown in fig 5 the fault in the br from case study 1 was not detected or corrected by operators at the time so it carries over into the training and monitoring period for case study 2 fig 6 illustrates this behavior for bio 1 do and both bio 2 do and sewage level exhibit similar patterns in the training window for case study 1 which is represented by the left green region bio 1 do is truly ic but becomes oc towards the end of the training period when bio 1 do continues to increase during the monitoring period of case study 1 the left blue region the observations are flagged as oc by ads pca the fault was not detected by operators in the br so we used our method with a training window that contained oc data in case study 2 the right green region as a result fig 5 a shows that our method does not flag any observations as oc during the monitoring period of case study 2 the right blue region because the oc behavior in these variables is now considered to be ic by the method this is to be expected given that the method is purely data driven there is also oc behavior present in the training window for the mbr that was initially overlooked by operators around january 4 the beginning of the monitoring period full time operators returned to campus from the holidays and identified a decrease in perm turbidity due to an equipment failure that had gone unrepaired over the break following a manual adjustment the perm turbidity increased to normal operating conditions because the method trains on oc data for perm turbidity the method flags ic perm turbidity data as oc as seen in fig 5 b nevertheless operators believe the oc behavior was isolated to perm turbidity so the fi results for other variables are still reliable and provide insight into the true cause of the fault in the mbr a clog initially caused by hair which is not completely removed by the 2 mm fine screen and is not digested by microorganisms grew in the ras pump and this is detected by ads pca late in the evening on january 4 the clog caused a slow decrease in the mbr influent flow resulting in an initially intermittent shift and transitioning to a persistent downward shift detected in mbr 1 inf flow and mbr 2 inf flow additionally the low strength of the wastewater due to the absence of students over the holidays led to a decline in biomass which resulted in a decrease in mbr 1 tss mbr 2 tss and ras tss the downward shift in perm conductivity detected at the beginning of january 5 was a result of a sensor fault the changes in the influent flow caused by the clog were very gradual and occurred over the course of multiple days so this fault was a long slow drift as a result the method only intermittently detects the downward shift in influent flow on january 4 and 5 but by january 6 the shift is consistently flagged in comparison in the absence of a real time fi method the clog went undiagnosed by operators for almost three weeks and was finally corrected on january 25 therefore this method would have identified the fault in the influent flow almost three weeks sooner than the operators did which could have improved system performance and stability the detection of the downward shift in tss would have also pointed operators to a change in environmental pressures which would have allowed them to alter the operating conditions to buffer against the decline 3 5 case study 3 the training window for case study 3 is january 23 27 2018 followed by a two and a half day monitoring window the fault in the mbr discussed in case study 2 was not corrected until january 25 so the training window for the mbr is not truly ic therefore we focus solely on the br which is where the fault occurred for case study 3 on january 29 a clog occurred in the raw wastewater diversion feeding the holding tank which feeds the sb mbr causing the sewage level to drop this exposed the submerged pump responsible for feeding the sb mbr causing it to overheat and shut down as a result raw wastewater was not delivered to the brs causing the br levels to decrease which is evident in the downward shifts detected in bio 1 level and bio 2 level see fig 7 mid day on january 29 without additional wastewater there was no carbon or nutrients present to oxidize or provide microbial growth consequently similar to case study 1 the do concentrations immediately reached the setpoint without any readily oxidizeable material to consume the do provided by the air blowers which is consistent with a shift up in bio 1 do and bio 2 do detected by ads pca operators were alerted to the problem when bio 1 level and bio 2 level dropped below their pre specified threshold had the fault been detected sooner the pump may not have been exposed which would have prevented permanent equipment damage during the fault event no wastewater could be treated for a facility with limited holding capacity this would have been detrimental and would have led to untreated water being discharged to the environment this fault could have easily been avoided with the installation of a more stringent level or level decline rate alarm but the sensor was not accurately calibrated at the time of the fault and the thresholds were not trusted by operators given the design of the system at the time of the fault these results illustrate the power of a data driven fd method to inexpensively complement existing wwt control systems and prevent severe consequences of simple faults 4 discussion when incorporating a fd i monitoring scheme into a wwt control system it is important to remember that mspm methods are purely data driven even if the method performs as expected it is possible for the results to be misleading or inconsistent with an operator s assessment of the fault for example the temperature variables were frequently flagged as shifted even when upon further inspection by operators the shifts were not substantial or were of no consequence these false alarms were a result of a poor fit for the trend in eq 1 that resulted in nonstationarity in the residuals leading to a shift detected in the mean when the temperatures increased or decreased secondly ads pca is very sensitive to the choice of the training data set as highlighted in case study 2 if a data set with oc behavior is used to train the model the monitoring scheme may flag ic data as oc therefore it is imperative that operators and system experts thoroughly analyze the training data set prior to monitoring additionally it is advisable to reset the monitoring scheme after a fault is detected diagnosed and corrected to ensure that the training window is not contaminated with observations from the oc period that were incorrectly classified as ic which is especially common for long slow drift faults in spite of some of the inherent limitations of ads pca it is able to account for changes in operating conditions by removing the effect of control settings influent changes and external factors on the monitored variables via the adaptive lasso linear regression the general framework used for detrending makes this method very flexible for a variety of system configurations because lasso regression performs variable selection and parameter estimation simultaneously it allows the user to include a multitude of predictor variables in the model without extensive model development or prior knowledge of the relationship between each response and predictor variable this method can also accommodate stationary data by simply monitoring the standardized response variables rather than constructing a set of linear models and monitoring the residuals ads pca is the first fully functional fd i approach that can be used for wwt processes in real time and the approach can also be applied in other complex settings where nonstationarity temporal dependence and non normality are present in the data this method is particularly important for facilities of communities with limited means that might have outdated control systems instead of inspecting time series plots for each individual variable which can lead to missed detection and delays in fault diagnosis checkerboard plots allow operators to monitor all variables in the system simultaneously they can be a very useful tool for operators to gain insight into the particular variables that are shifted we demonstrate the utility of our approach in three complex fault settings at a decentralized wwt facility by comparing the operators post hoc analysis of the faults along with their response in real time with the insight provided by ads pca and the checkerboard plots which confirms that our approach would have facilitated a more rapid detection and diagnosis had it been implemented in real time without our fully integrated approach operators are limited by the knowledge that a single variable is outside of the operator determined thresholds that distinguish ic verses oc conditions ads pca and the checkerboard plots are intended to complement the expertise of wwt operators by synthesizing the wealth of data collected in wwt systems narrowing their focus to specific components of the system that require attention and facilitating more rapid fault diagnosis in a multivariate system authors contribution molly c klanderman methodology

13793,wastewater processing mediates industrial and domestic wastes and supports societal ecological and economic values unfortunately no single process alone is able to sustain wastewater processing

molecules inside the fbbr this bioreactor was fully packed with micro media ultra media kaldnes k1 micro and green ammonia absorption stones during the biodegradation biogas and biomass were generated as valuable products ozonation oxidized all the fbbr effluents at an ozone dose of 15 mg l for 24 h before being discharged for electrodialysis because bioremediation definitely does not decompose all suspended solids then the electrodialysis received the ozonated effluents and electrically separated these biodegraded substances the effluents of fbbr ozonation and electrodialysis were analyzed to find the chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen ammonia nh3 n nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 n concentrations the zero waste system involving micro media fbbr ozonation and 40 volts electrodialysis successfully produced a first class effluent that had 0 mg cod l and 0 mg l nitrogen compounds in addition it had a 0 mg l concentration of k ca mg mn fe b zn cu br2 cl2 o3 and so4 2 so the effluent

suspended oil particles and dissolved elements chemical treatments also may generate harmful sludge biological treatments can be inexpensive eco friendly and cooperate better with various other operations 10 microorganisms degrade transform and chelate various toxic pollutants by using them as a source of carbon and energy the end result is the transformation of wastewater contaminants into harmless or less toxic forms however heavy metals cannot be destroyed or be transformed from one complex state to another biologically such processing only changes their water solubility and decreases their toxicity biological treatments can have unstable performance generate emissions of greenhouse gases and deliver deficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal so a more advanced system is needed to deliver complete wastewater treatment and produce the desired effluent water quality sajjad al amshawee hypothesized a system comprised of a fixed bed biofilm reactor fbbr ozonation and electrodialysis desalination to treat strong wastewater this integrated system was named zero waste system the system was custom made and operated as a reliable and efficient wastewater system the zero waste system was proposed to act as a finishing wastewater strategy and it was investigated with actual wastewater involving various contaminates to find what quality of water was produced ozone oxidized the fbbr effluents before they were discharged for electrodialysis because the fbbr alone could not degrade all influent suspended solids this paper introduces the zero waste system and demonstrates its ability to generate clean water biogas and sludge it also demonstrates the possibility and effectiveness of integrating fbbr with ozonation and electrodialysis desalination the efficiency of the zero waste system was analyzed in terms of removing chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrogen compounds 2 materials and methods 2 1 zero waste system construction the zero waste system was made to decompose wastewater pollutants without any added chemicals and be flexible in handling different feeds it is comprised of fbbr ozone oxidation and electrodialysis desalination see fig 1 the fbbr and the electrodialysis stack were custom made table 1 details the specifications of the zero waste system kaldnes k1 micro green ammonia absorption stones micro media and ultra media have been selected as biofilm carriers to immobilize suspended biomass inside the fbbr see fig 2 micro media and ultra media are new designs of biofilm carriers that have been introduced by al amshawee et al 11 to boost the entrapment of biofilm in addition micro media and ultra media have rough surfaces to prevent biofilm disruption leading to stable and predictable biological performance the fbbr performance was studied with 100 packing rate of micro media 80 pieces ultra media 10 pieces kaldnes k1 micro 1650 pieces and green ammonia absorption stones the fbbr was seeded with sludge to allow a rapid start up with high performance and to understand the biofilm carriers behavior as it occurs in large scale industrial treatment the operating temperature was maintained constant at 35 c using a thermostatic water bath finally the bioreactor was covered with aluminum foil papers to prevent light from penetrating the reactor and disturbing the microorganisms it was also equipped with gas tight bags at the top to collect the biogas the zero waste system started with an influent flow to the inside of fbbr microbes swim in the fbbr medium seeking appropriate surfaces to attach and grow thus a number of biofilm carriers were used to increase the surface area each piece of biocarriers serves as an active platform enhancing mass transfer and sustaining bioﬁlm growth it results in the formation of a sheltered and stable bioﬁlm defending microbes from an alteration in wastewater parameters e g influent characteristics and operating procedures the formation of bioﬁlms on carriers also reduces the washout of bacterial biomass and enhances the enrichment of functional bacteria for 6 days of operating duration microbes used nutrients as energy to decompose contaminants and heavy

a stone diffuser for maximum ozone utilization ozone was created by converting air oxygen through several processes subsequently the ozone generated was dissolved and mixed with wastewater for oxidation the reactor mixing was powered by ozone gas sparging where effluent recirculation was not used ozone could destroy nonbiodegradable and suspended solids of the fbbr effluent that had still not decomposed into small sizes at the end of day 7 the effluent from ozonation was released for further treatment by electrodialysis electrodialysis desalination is an electrically driven membrane treatment comprising electric supply electrodes and membrane films the electric current attracts a vast range of charged ions molecules and substances from the influent stream electrodialysis was utilized to treat the least contaminated effluent of fbbr at different voltages of 20 pulsed 20 40 pulsed 40 and 60 volts the pulsed current is comprised of brief bursts of direct current after the fbbr and ozonation successfully decomposed contaminants into a smaller size the electrodialysis could easily separate it and produce a high quality effluent table 1 presents most of the system specifications 2 2 palm oil mill effluent pome the fbbr was fed with 1 7 l pome and 0 17 l sludge taken from the second anaerobic pond of lkpp corporation which is located in gambang pahang malaysia it is worth mentioning that the process of lkpp corporation for pome is comprised of 7 anaerobic ponds facultative pond aeration pond and final settling pond accordingly the solution of the first anaerobic pond cannot be processed inside the fbbr because it has a too high concentration of solids the pome and the seeding sludge were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c before physical and chemical analysis table 2 shows the properties of the used influent originally using the sludge seeds of the facultative pond was proposed this pond has an abundance of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms however the operating process of the fbbr is anaerobic so there were doubts that the facultative sludge could work in the anaerobic fbbr the sludge seeds from the anaerobic ponds were chosen for cultivation 2 3 analytical methods the cod concentration of samples was measured using a hach reactor drb200 and a hach dr3900 from arachem m sdn bhd malaysia the hach dr3900 was also used to measure the concentrations of nh3 n no2 and no3 n the size of effluents particles was generally measured with using malvern zetasizer nano s90 malvern panalytical ltd united kingdom an oven memmert ipp500 germany was used to dry biofilm carriers to find attached growth biomass agbs see eq 2 finally the generated biogas was collected in a gasbag and analyzed using gas chromatography flame ionization detector gc fid agilent technologies 7890b united states with helium as the carrier gas pome and test samples were analyzed within 4 h of sampling some mathematical equations were used to clarify the results further the total nitrogen removal was estimated as follows 1 t o t a l n i t r o g e n r e m o v a l 1 n h 3 n e f f n o 2 e f f n o 3 n e f f n h 3 n i n f n o 2 i n f n o 3 n i n f x 100 where n o 2 e f f n o 3 n e f f and n h 3 n e f f are the effluent concentrations mg l while n o 2 i n f n o 3 n i n f and n h 3 n i n f are the influent concentrations mg l attached growth biomass agbs was only estimated for micro media ultra media and kaldnes k1 micro since they have a uniform design the green ammonia absorption stones had irregular shapes and sizes the agbs g g carrier was calculated as follows 2 a g b s m b m a m c where m a is the carrier mass dried at 105 c m b is the sum of the mass of carrier and microorganism dried at 105 c and m c is the mass of the carrier after removal of microorganisms dried at 105 c the morphology and elements of developed biofilms on the surface of biofilm carriers were examined by scanning electron microscopy sem with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx at a beam energy of 15 kv and high vacuum hitachi tm3030 japan the samples were only dried prior to sem examination without washing nor coating with a thin layer of gold 3 results and discussion the results and discussion are separated based on the process type into fbbr ozonation and electrodialysis desalination the performance is then discussed based on the analysis i e cod nitrogen compounds 3 1 fixed bed biofilm reactor fbbr the fbbr is a biological process where microbes and biomass attached to the biofilm carriers decompose most of the suspended pollutants into tiny molecules the biodegradation stops when the contaminants are in ionic form so microbes can easily absorb them as an energy source the novelty of fbbr lies in using newly designed biofilm carriers known as micro and ultra media al amshawee et al 11 discussed both designs and showed their effectiveness and uniqueness compared to a large number of other biofilm carriers 3 1 1 optimization of fixed bed biofilm reactor fbbr for efficient operation the fbbr had to be optimized either experimentally or theoretically it was decided to maximize the fbbr performance experimentally varying only the basic conditions which are flowrate packing rate and feed type the cod concentration was used to indicate the impact of changing the input variables because it describes the overall process performance future studies will explore the other changes needed to achieve excellent fbbr performance micro media was the biofilm support in all the optimization experiments and the fbbr was 100 packed i e fixed bed all the experiments used anaerobic pome as a bioreactor feed and they were operated at 35 c and 100 ml min influent flowrate 3 1 1 1 feed there were challenges expected associated with feeding the fbbr with fresh anaerobic pome little treatment efficacy with the fbbr was expected for this feed due to the high organic loading rate for this reason pome from the aerobic pond was also chosen as a feed however the aerobic pome had passed through a number of biodegradations and so was expected to produce little biogas or sludge the fbbr was set up to examine its performance in processing feeds of both aerobic and anaerobic pome when the aerobic pome was fed to the fbbr the air was pumped only on the first day to keep the conditions aerobic and continue the nitrification process anaerobic conditions were used instead of oxygen for processing the anaerobic pome the aerobic pome process was seeded with sludge from the aerobic pond while the anaerobic pond sludge was added to the anaerobic pome process the rest of the conditions were the same for both types of influent fig 3 shows the fbbr performance in processing aerobic and anaerobic pome in terms of cod fig 3 shows that the aerobic pome process was unstable and did not progress since it ended on the 6th day having a higher cod 938 mg l than its initial cod 870 mg l thus the fbbr and its micro media were not suitable to retain the aerobic pome biomass a low range of nutrients and having sludge seeds possibly impacted the process efficiency if a lower flowrate was used it could have led to a higher cod reduction but this would reduce the biogas volume and quality the use of anaerobic pome as fbbr feed was auspicious it resulted in a rapid start up and excellent cod reduction unlike the aerobic pome processing the anaerobic pome process had unstable performance only on day 4 where cod increased from 2071 mg l at day 3 to 2170 mg l while the aerobic pome had an unstable performance during most of the treatment period on the 5th day the anaerobic pome became yellowish or light brown while the aerobic pome did not change the anaerobic pome process ended with 83 cod removal rate while the aerobic pome process failed to reduce the cod concentration for these reasons the fbbr was subsequently fed with anaerobic pome for the sake of promoting a sustainable treatment if the small biofilm carriers are ineffective at a given influent flow the larger ones e g ultra media should succeed in treating anaerobic pome 3 1 1 2 fixed vs moving bed a large number of past studies have reported success in using a moving bed and called not to use a fixed bed 12 the fixed bed has been reported to be prone to biological and physical clogging which can stop the treatment the present study does not agree with these past investigations since the fbbr performance is greatly dependent on carrier efficiency to retain biomass the effectiveness of biofilm carriers primarily determines fbbr performance in order to prove this hypothesis an experiment was run using a 100 packing rate i e fixed bed and a 50 packing rate i e moving bed of micro media fig 4 presents the performance of the 100 and 50 packing rates on day 1 of the moving bed process all of the pump pipes and sieve layer clogged with biomass turbulences possibly mixed the sludge seeds significantly with the influent the moving bed also allowed poor retention of biomass and solids inside the bioreactor therefore the pump voltage had to be increased from 6 to 12 volts to avoid clogging eventually the pump recirculated the effluent but with difficulties fig 4 shows that the 50 packing rate delivered a worse performance than the 100 packing rate the 100 packing rate gave a more rapid start up and produced a higher quality effluent of 1750 mg l on the 6th day in contrast the 50 packing rate delivered a lower quality effluent of 2470 mg l on the 6th day after the experiments were ended it was observed that the moving biofilm carriers possessed more biofilm growth covering all outer surfaces than the fixed bed carriers however cod is the main metric for indicating process performance in sum the fixed bed delivered better performance and effluent quality 3 1 1 3 influent flowrate influent flowrate was examined due to its impact on biomass immobilization high flowrates can create turbulence which easily disturbs biomass immobilization and wipe out developed biofilms low flowrates can fail to homogenize the bioreactor medium and ineffectively deliver nutrients to attached biofilms eventually low flowrates create a large number of dead spots fig 5 displays the fbbr performance at influent flowrates of 50 70 and 100 ml min during the 6 days the three flowrates showed a similar performance except at day 4 for 70 ml min flowrate this difference could have been due to adding a higher strength pome sample than usual or a higher number of suspended biomass for 70 ml min based on observation the lowest flowrate 50 ml min led to biofilm growth at the inner surfaces of pipes which slightly affected the pump efficiency unlike the higher flowrates therefore low flowrates are impractical because they might clog the pipes and even the pump with time in short fig 5 shows that a higher flowrate leads to a higher cod removal and more stable performance a higher flowrate also contributed to a higher volume and better quality of biogas production therefore 100 ml min was chosen for the standard flowrate for all the fbbr experiments 3 1 2 performance of fixed bed biofilm reactor fbbr in a past study by sajjad et al 13 of about 30 days of biological pome treatment it was noted that removal rates were optimum only at the start up this finding motivated implementing pome biological treatments for a maximum duration of 15 days if the conditions were not optimized nor controlled in the present study of fbbr all the conditions for temperature carriers and reactor were well designed a duration of 6 days was targeted to accomplish maximum pome biotreatment the properties of effluents treated by the fbbr were examined to find cod nh3 n no2 no3 n and total nitrogen removal also the biofilm carriers were examined to find agbs and biogas was volumetrically estimated and analyzed to find its quality table 3 shows the fbbr results which are categorized based on the biofilm carrier and analysis the process was anaerobic for the entire 6 days a condition known to degrade high strength wastes require a low rate of nutrients and produce biogas 14 this study is unlike past studies that had done long term wastewater treatment e g 300 days involving various conditions e g different loading rates temperature packing rate researchers believe that influent acclimation is vital 2 15 however the pome taken from the second anaerobic pond of lkpp corporation did not require any further acclimation in the fbbr because it was cultivated in its anaerobic pond therefore the biological process was initiated from the first moment this study is one of the few studies that has investigated the treatment of strong wastewater table 3 showed that all four biofilm carriers delivered a rapid removal of cod no2 no3 n nh3 n beginning the first day it does prove that acclimation will add no enhancements 3 1 2 1 biogas generation the biodegradation microorganisms e g methanogens anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox bacteria denitrifiers convert pome pollutants into biogas which is a mixture of carbon dioxide and methane and to a lesser extent hydrogen gas simultaneous removal of pome contaminants in the fbbr was associated with methane generation in fact the degradation of pome itself contributed to biogas production and also reduced the concentrations of cod and nitrogen compounds biogas generation was a complex process to predict and understand since many factors can raise or significantly reduce biogas quality and volume 16 17 the high contamination of pome indicates that a large amount of energy can be recovered however there was a concern that the high pome concentration might be toxic or inhibitory to anaerobes zheng et al 12 reported that the process complexity decides biogas generation and quality and could result in long lag phases and slow rates however the process showed biogas production at the start unlike the study of martí herrero et al 18 where biogas generation began slowly on day 20 the methane content of the generated biogas was determined by direct injection into the gas chromatography unit equipped with a thermal conductivity detector gc tcd which was described in 2 3 analytical methods the results in table 3 show the performance of biofilm carriers in terms of biogas volume as follows green ammonia absorption stones ultra media micro media kaldnes k1 micro while in terms of methane percentage as follows micro media ultra media kaldnes k1 micro green ammonia absorption stones the kaldnes k1 micro did not deliver as high biogas quality and quantity as other carriers due to insufficient mixing properties the kaldnes k1 micro has the smallest compartments compared to micro media and ultra media which significantly restricted nutrients transport to the inner voids in addition the small size of kaldnes k1 micro mostly restricted influent flow through the inner compartments which technically can be considered dead zones see fig 6 the pump occasionally was ineffective in sending the influent to the fbbr because the kaldnes k1 micro had limited free space causing solution leakage from the bioreactor future studies will install a pressure gauge to closely monitor the response of packing bed to influent flow a middle wastewater tank could also be used as an option to reduce the inner pressure the pump sends influent from the wastewater tank to the bioreactor then the excess influent gradually gets discharged back to the tank even if agitation were introduced besides recirculation to improve the mixing properties it would not significantly improve the performance of kaldnes k1 micro carrier no foam nor bubbles were seen at the surface this lack of foaming suggests that the small biofilm carrier blocked all turbulence caused by recirculation in contrast the large biofilm carriers micro and ultra media provided ample space for turbulence to occur in short small biofilm carriers could result in high biofilm growth high solids retention and poorer mixing properties in contrast large biofilm carriers resulted in lower biofilm growth lower solid retention and better mixing properties the green ammonia absorption stones were packed tighter than kaldnes k1 micro carriers but it did not cause clogging nor high inner pressure this can be explained by the fins and small compartments of kaldnes k1 micro compared to the green ammonia absorption stones which have neither green ammonia absorption stone delivered the highest volume of biogas unfortunately it produced the lowest biogas quality for two possible reasons oxygen in their pores or their oxygen generating nature eventually the oxygen with the green ammonia absorption stones lowered the anaerobic biodegradation performance micro media and ultra media produced similar quality and volume of biogas due to their appropriate size and shape see fig 6 during the experiments with these carriers a considerable amount of foam covered the fbbr surface which is concrete evidence of excellent mixing properties eventually the effluent color changed from dark black into light brown similarly pandey and sarkar 19 showed appreciable biogas generation potential with an average methane content of 48 at steady state the high pome concentration had a major impact on the biogas generation rate and quality where it slowed and limited the biodegradation rate possibly it could inhibit voids from performing biodegradation and generating biogas for instance souza et al 20 achieved low biogas generation rates despite high cod removals of 70 alvarado lassman et al 21 observed a slight decrease in methane yield and cod removal with each incremental increase in organic loading others reported that significant amounts of biogas were not recovered 22 the practice of biofilm carriers definitely influenced the produced biogas volume and quality for instance martí herrero et al 18 raised biogas generation to 44 when polyethylene terephthalate pet rings were added to the bioreactor and dutta et al 23 increased biogas production rate by 50 ml when biofilm carriers were used many operators face the challenge of not reach the promised biogas yields this is caused by common errors in traditional design methodology wong et al 24 raised the daily biogas generation from 17 79 l per day to 46 76 l per day when the organic loading rate was increased and manariotis and grigoropoulos 25 increased the conversion rate of organic matter to biogas by lowering the hydraulic retention time hrt so using accurate design improved thermal performance and high load rates is important 18 however future studies still need to clarify the precise phenomena that govern the increase of biogas production 18 also the bioreactor stability and optimum operational parameters still need to be studied pome characterized by high organic content is a source with great potential for biogas production biogas is very valuable and clean energy if properly functionalized 26 pantoja filho et al 27 used biogas as an electron donor for the simultaneous removal of ammonia and nitrate in a tertiary aerobic anoxic ﬁxed bed reactor kim et al 28 converted the generated biogas into heat energy for maintaining the moderate temperature of anaerobic mbbr efﬂuent a treatment facility can take advantage of this biogas to generate electricity in a recent study if all the pome generated in malaysia was treated by anaerobic digestion it would save 671 65 million ringgits yearly approximately us 170 000 000 year 7 studies suggest it could support about 700 000 households in malaysia 29 this zero waste system could be a promising source for biogas production and potentially could boost the renewable energy sector future studies will properly evaluate the zero waste system s potential for methane recovery from pome treatment inside the fbbr and should attract investors 3 1 2 2 removal of nitrogen compounds nh3 n no3 n no2 in general wastewaters are contaminated with various organics and inorganics where some present in the form of nh3 n these are converted into no2 and subsequently into no3 n finally nitrogen gas is produced the fbbr delivered the exact process but with various conversion rates pome had a nitrogen ammonia concentration of 800 mg l after one day of biodegradation micro media ultra media kaldnes k1 micro and green ammonia absorption stones reduced the nitrogen ammonia concentration into 387 mg l 427 mg l 445 mg l and 463 mg l respectively the same ordering micro media ultra media kaldnes k1 micro green ammonia absorption stones remained for the 2nd and 3rd day on the 4th day the nh3 n of micro media process jumped from 97 mg l to 150 mg l despite the fact there was no change in conditions strangely ultra media kaldnes k1 micro and the green ammonia absorption stones showed insignificant nh3 n removal on the same day for instance ultra media reduced nh3 n concentration from 131 mg l into 130 mg l and kaldnes k1 micro lowered nh3 n from 157 mg l to 140 mg l despite frequent reports about the long start up time of anaerobic biodegradation 30 this study delivered excellent results during the first 2 3 days the nh3 n removal continued but with irregularity i e insignificant removal rates unexpected increase in nh3 n concertation the toxic effect of the influent could possibly have destabilized the process 12 on the 6th day the biodegradation achieved 100 100 100 and 190 mg nh3 n l for micro media ultra media kaldnes k1 micro and green ammonia absorption stones respectively it means that micro media delivered a rapid start up but with time most of the carriers achieved a similar removal rate the behavior of the four biofilm carriers in removing nh3 n was similarly in removing no2 and no3 n however the green ammonia absorption stones delivered higher rates of no2 and no3 n removal than ultra media on the 6th day eq 1 was used to estimate total nitrogen removal it showed an overview of the removal performance for nh3 n no2 and no3 n combined after one day of treatment the performance level could be ranked as micro media kaldnes k1 micro ultra media green ammonia absorption stones on the 6th day all of micro media ultra media and kaldnes k1 micro reduced nh3 n concentration to a similar concentration of 100 mg l from this data it is challenging to decide which is the best carrier fortunately total nitrogen removal showed a better image where it ranked the removal efficiency as micro media kaldnes k1 micro ultra media green ammonia absorption stones most importantly the total nitrogen removal is mostly synchronized with the concentrations of nh3 n no2 and no3 n a number of wastewater bioremediations may develop inside the fbbr such as nitrification and denitrification however only anaerobic conditions were used which led to anaerobic ammonium oxidation microorganisms anammox anammox has high nitrogen removal rates and they prefer to grow in the form of bioﬁlms on the surface of carriers 31 in the anammox reaction ammonium and nitrite were converted into nitrogen gas n2 under anoxic anaerobic conditions eq 3 indicates the anammox reaction 32 in the end the utilization of anammox microorganisms in the fbbr was efﬁcient for nitrogen compounds removal 3 nh4 1 32no2 0 066hco3 0 13h 1 02n2 0 26no3 0 066ch2o0 5n0 15 2 03h2o 3 1 2 3 removal of chemical oxygen demand cod the cod concentration is a fundamental parameter for analysis it is similar to total nitrogen removal in giving an overview but it tells nothing about the pollutants it was analyzed for the four biofilm carriers during the period of biodegradation after one day of treatment the results in table 3 showed the beds performance ranking as kaldnes k1 micro micro media green ammonia absorption stones ultra media it is quite dissimilar to the nitrogen compounds removal ranking micro media ultra media kaldnes k1 micro green ammonia absorption stones and total nitrogen removal micro media kaldnes k1 micro ultra media green ammonia absorption stones in here kaldnes k1 micro was better than micro media because of its small compartments that rapidly and forcefully retained a greater number of suspended solids than the others however it is technically impractical for long term treatments kaldnes k1 micro failed to achieve a lower cod concentration than micro media on the 5th and 6th days also it had unstable cod removal as shown in table 3 on day 4 it can be postulated that the kaldnes k1 micro became clogged unfortunately cod could not explain the instability of the nitrogen compounds removal however at the end of the 6th day it showed the media performance ranking as micro media kaldnes k1 micro ultra media green ammonia absorption stones which is pretty similar to the total nitrogen removal ranking during the 6 days of anaerobic digestion the cod concentration was simultaneously reduced with the generation of biogas and retention of sludge 3 1 2 4 biofilm carriers the columnar shape of the fbbr 30 cm height 10 cm diameter was very significant in activating all the packing bed most of the influent passed through most of the packing bed which greatly distributed the nutrients to the immobilized biofilms therefore it contributed to preserving the process stability and retaining high performance for long term also recirculation made the suspended biomass contact a greater number of biofilm carriers this recirculation is needed to increase the retention of pollutants inside the fbbr at the media surfaces the better the retention performance of biomass by carriers the less recirculation is needed 33 in other words recirculation is required due to the inability of carriers to fully capture pollutants and some studies have called for the usage of settling tanks 34 all the synthetic carriers of micro media kaldnes k1 micro and ultra media were made of polymer due to pome corrosiveness this pome property means that metallic biofilm carriers are not recommended all the biofilm carriers initially act as filters to retain pollutants then the developed biofilms gradually lead to decomposition biological decomposition may be of less importance than the carrier ability to retain pollutants however bezerra et al 35 suggested that the decrease in organic matter concentration is a result of anaerobic biodegradation rather than physical chemical phenomena table 3 shows that micro media was the most superior biofilm carrier in terms of effluent quality and process stability compared to ultra media kaldnes k1 micro and green ammonia absorption stones not only did micro media provide high surface area for biofilm attachment but it also helped to prevent biofilm and biomass from escaping with the effluent ultra media has a similar shape to micro media but its larger size presented a lower total surface area of 5836 136 mm2 compared to micro media 13464 mm2 for suspended solids entrapment and biofilm growth 11 kaldnes k1 micro had a smaller size than micro media that largely failed to promote a hydrodynamic flow at the same time the green stones have only outside surface area due to not having inner compartments as the synthetic carriers do moreover the conditions used were optimized based on micro media so that the conditions used could have been impractical for the other carriers each carrier may require different flowrates filling ratios hydraulic retention times and even different temperatures during the experiments the temperature of the recycled effluent was measured it was found to be about 30 c which is less than the desired 35 c using a high filling ratio of biofilm carriers with low porosity requires heating to keep the bioreactor at a given temperature eq 2 was used to estimate the attached growth biomass agbs g g carrier for only the synthetic carriers unlike a large number of studies that randomly selected biofilm carriers for agbs testing 19 36 this study chose carriers with the highest biofilm attachment the results of agbs testing indicate that micro media immobilized more biomass than either kaldnes k1 micro or ultra media biofilm growth on carriers can vary for many different reasons one of which is unequal mixing the performance ranking as micro media kaldnes k1 micro ultra media fits well with data for agbs cod nh3 n no2 no3 n total nitrogen removal and biogas quality based on observation it is noteworthy that biofilm did not play a significant role in determining bioreactor performance however if biofilm has a proper thickness it is essential for a long term process few studies of biofilm carriers in terms of design shape and roughness have been published 5 37 38 even with the findings of this study it is still not possible to deliver a detailed theory specifying the perfect carrier however this study in general finds the perfect carrier has 1 a suitable size to effectively immobilize biomass 2 fins corrugations as in micro media and ultra media to prevent biofilm from detachment and 3 an appropriate shape to allow mixing and nutrient transport future studies may design biofilm carriers in the shape of a unified bed rather than the addition of a number of carriers see fig 7 the unified bed will tremendously help in studying a bed s ability to retain influent contaminants in unpublished previous research kaldnes k1 micro delivered a better pome treatment than micro media however micro media showed a greater performance than k1 micro in this study this may be due to carrier orientation inside the bioreactor against influent flow and turbulences that led to a dissimilar entrapment of biomass and growth of biofilms however dizge et al 40 reported that the limitation of oxygen transfer is responsible for the irregular growth of biofilm fig 8 shows irregular growth on different parts of micro media the biofilm formed on the surfaces of biofilm carriers was visually observed fig 9 pictures the outgrowth of biofilm on the surface of micro media after 6 days of continuous anaerobic pome treatment the biofilm growth was tightly packed and covered all the large surface areas of micro media as shown in fig 9 on the contrary past studies have shown biofilm growth on only a few spots of the carrier s surfaces and reported voids and channels between many microcolonies 41 42 in here only the best biofilm carrier micro media was analyzed by sem and past studies found similar biofilm structures on different biofilm carriers 43 the growth of biofilm thus greatly depends on the influent the edx analysis recognized the presence of carbon 45 033 oxygen 47 557 magnesium 0 261 aluminum 1 657 silicon 1 960 phosphorus 0 355 sulfur 0 395 potassium 0 535 calcium 0 779 titanium 0 379 and iron 1 089 as the dominant components in the attached biofilm similar findings were reported by garrido baserba et al 44 fig 9 shows that the suspended biomass accumulated and formed a dense biofilm on the surface of micro media the dense growth of biofilms on the surfaces of micro media definitely involved aggregates of cells as past studies have reported 45 these microbial aggregates play an important role in retaining the acclimatized microflora on the carrier s surfaces eventually this high density biomass formed a rich biofilm and improved the degradation efficiency however the majority of pollutant removal was accounted for by the effectiveness of the carrier s design in entrapping suspended biomass recent studies such as wang et al 46 work have extensively investigated the formation of biofilm on various surfaces of biofilm carriers without considering the carrier s design as shown in the sem images fig 9 the biofilms had rough surfaces with a microporous structure which could be used as an efficient surface for the immobilization of suspended pollutants from aqueous solution similar morphologies were found in past studies acar and dincer 47 reported similar biofilm morphologies of fig 9 on a rigid high density polyethylene mesh hdpe after 90 days of operation and the developed biofilms were called mature when other studies examined the biofilm s growth at 10 30 days the growth was found insignificant 48 50 however dizge et al 51 reported rapid growth of biofilm during 1 10 days of wastewater treatment when a high strength influent with mixed liquor suspended solids of 1000 32 8 mg l was used the study undertaken by dizge et al 51 is in line with the present study that duration of biofilm growth greatly dependent on the influent strength heavy loaded influents promote a biofilm growth with a different morphology from unloaded samples ahmad et al 52 confirmed the formation of porous biofilm on biofilm carrier s surfaces fig 9a shows dense and evenly spread bioﬁlms on the carrier s surface at a magnification scale of 1 mm which is similar to what was reported by hwang et al 53 and zhang et al 54 surprisingly the biofilm growth shown in fig 9 is much similar to biofilm growth on the membrane surfaces of a submerged membrane bioreactor in the treatment of synthetic municipal sewage 55 however when páca et al 56 developed biofilms in a packed bed reactor during aerobic conditions the produced biofilm was similar to fig 9c but it missed the micropores it means that the pattern of bioﬁlm expansion is different under anaerobic and aerobic conditions fig 9 displayed varied and well developed pores the porous structure is beneficial for the penetration of nutrient and the discharge of produced gas and sludge 3 1 2 5 sludge production the fbbr of zero waste system was not analyzed in terms of sludge production because fresh sludge seeds from pome treatment plant was used sections 2 1 2 2 so this section discusses the fbbr behavior in producing sludge studies have competed for decades to promote efficient treatment processes associated with low sludge production most of past studies promoted anaerobic digestion due to its low sludge production 23 they even promoted fbbr or attached growth bioreactor for low excess sludge production 57 58 studies also discussed anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox to give 90 less sludge production 59 60 other systems were also introduced to largely retain sludge such as membrane bioreactor mbr 61 these systems have not been developed to harvest or cultivate by products all the systems were analyzed in terms of feasibility and economics for lower operating costs energy consumption and sludge production the fbbr of zero waste system promotes sludge generation unlike past studies that considered sludge production to be an environment risk and to negatively impact wastewater treatment 58 62 if sludge led to technical problems then biofilm carriers and reactor design have to be advanced to deliver excellent sludge settling ability and prevent sludge bulking for instance tabassum et al 63 detected sludge contents in the 4th reactor effluent due to the failure of first 3 reactors to retain sludge in section 3 1 2 1 it was demonstrated that biogas was generated but not as much as reported in many studies 24 the incomplete conversion of carbon substrates to biogas is due to the lack of organic compounds which leads to incomplete degradation of nitrogen contaminants and results in biomass sludge production 64 65 sludge production in the anaerobic reactors may be attributed to ﬂocculation of nonbiodegradable particulate matter forming an inert sludge mass fraction and a biological sludge mass that is generated as a result of anaerobic conversion 66 the production rate of sludge is proportional to the strength of the influent where it requires high amounts of carbon substrate the feed pome has a wide range of pollutant concentrations e g 8680 mg cod l where the addition of external carbon or a high loading rate of more substrate can potentially cause excess sludge production and gradually increase cod concentration 67 68 thanks to the fbbr no sludge recycling is needed and the produced sludge is retained inside the bioreactor alvarado lassman et al 21 observed a signiﬁcant increment in biomass production during the first 12 days using 70 g cod l loading rate despite the fact that anaerobic digestion creates low sludge production with a low energy requirement compared to aerobic digestion 19 it would be valuable for a long term process where the accumulated sludge will stabilize the process performance and microbial community it would also generate biogas from decomposing complex biomass retained at the bioreactor s bottom sludge can cause membrane fouling and short circuiting as reported by a large number of studies 69 71 but it aided in the fbbr process derakhshan et al 72 recorded a lower stabilization ratio when the process produced less sludge the zero waste system is unlike other treatment processes because it favors an ultimate balance between biogas generation and sludge production the generated sludge can be easily dewatered and does not require extensive post treatment 22 on the other hand previous studies have focused on only producing clean water without giving attention to clean energy from wastewater 3 2 ozone oxidation ozone was proposed because it is a very reactive oxidizing agent and can effectively deactivate e coli and gram negative bacteria e g legionella 73 74 technically ozone reacts with inert solids oxidizing and transforming them to a biodegradable form it can enhance the general biodegradation reduce sludge production significantly without shutting down the bioreactor and even improve the dead biomass decomposition in terms of costs ozonation operating cost for treatment of both wastewater and sludge is only us 0 0115 m3 75 if oxygen was used it would not lead to significant changes because it is a weak oxidant and always tends to escape in shape of bubbles the very slow consumption of oxygen is strong evidence of its poor impact on biodegradation also using oxygen as an oxidant requires energy and capital costs and delivers a slow and poor cod removal therefore ozone replaced oxygen to reduce the treatment duration and increase the effluent quality ozone was introduced to the fbbr effluent to aid in decomposing the remaining contaminants and to keep the conductivity in a high range also the ozonation effluent will need a short duration for solid deposition at the reactor bottom before getting discharged to the electrodialysis after ozonation the effluent will have only ions or tiny pollutants and electrodialysis will have no technical problem in processing it in order to implement comparable conditions for all fbbr effluents ozone oxidation was applied at a flowrate of 0 5 l min for 24 h for all the fbbr effluents based on the manufacturer notes of ch ptf3ga 1 ozone generator the 0 5 l min air flowrate generated an ozone dose of 15 mg l table 4 presents the results of cod nh3 n no2 and no3 n analysis for fbbr effluents before and after ozonation ozone oxidation changed the original 100 100 and 100 mg nh3 n l from micro media ultra media and kaldnes k1 micro carrier treatment to 14 70 and 120 mg nh3 n l respectively the lowest final concentration of nh3 n 14 mg l is clear evidence of the superior performance of the micro media compared to the other carriers the green ammonia absorption stones delivered the second best effluent after the micro media it delivered lower cod concentration 1217 mg l than kaldnes k1 micro 2050 mg l and ultra media 2120 mg l these findings are in good agreement with the removal of nitrogen compounds the reduced pollutants size presumably enabled ozone to effectively abate it on the other hand after ozonating the effluent of k1 micro it showed the worst no2 and no3 n concentrations compared to other effluents apparently k1 micro fbbr was not efficient in degrading pome contaminants 3 3 electrodialysis desalination the electrodialysis unit was made of compartments 4 cm wide to successfully treat the highly polluted pome and avoid having spacer clogging the impact of continuous and pulsed currents was researched at different voltages the pulsed current was applied with a frequency of 21 08 khz due to the lack of time and resources the ozonated micro media fbbr effluent as the highest quality effluent was the only influent chosen to be processed by electrodialysis desalination table 5 shows the results of the electrodialysis desalinating the ozonated micro media fbbr effluent 3 3 1 removal of chemical oxygen demand cod the electrodialysis desalination was investigated under 20 pulsed 20 40 pulsed 40 and 60 volts each run lasted for 3 days 72 h where sampling was made each 24 h table 5 shows that the electrodialysis is uncomplex compared to fbbr where it electrically removed the charged pollutants for cod removal it was effective in processing strong wastewater of 938 mg cod l after 24 h its performance for cod removal could be arranged as 40 volts pulsed 40 volts 60 volts pulsed 20 volts 20 volts the 20 volts treatment possibly needed a longer time to deliver similar removal rates compared to the 40 volts in conclusion high voltages required a shorter duration to remove the same number of ions compared to low voltages however 60 volts demonstrated a worse performance than 40 volts and pulsed 40 volts thus 40 volts was the optimal and any further increase in voltage did not increase ion transport 76 at 24 h the results showed that pulsed 20 volts delivered a higher cod removal than 20 volts on the other hand 40 volts achieved a higher cod removal than pulsed 40 volts the pulsed current was better at lower voltages than the optimal voltage but it could not accomplish the same performance as continuous current after 24 h however after 72 h 20 volts accomplished a much higher cod removal 45 mg l than pulsed 20 volts 97 mg l based on observation pulsed operation took a longer duration to remove dilute color than the continuous current however pulsed and continuous current performed similarly at low voltages the cod concentration increased from 0 mg l at the 48 h to 1 mg l at the 72 h during the pulsed 40 volts showing its effectiveness to be less consistent also it increased from 91 mg l at the 48 h to 97 mg l at the 72 h during the pulsed 20 volts in the end the 40 volts that delivered the best start up showed the best effluent with 0 mg cod l with only 24 h of electrodialysis recent studies have reported that pulsed current was very effective 77 however the pulsed current did not perform as well as the continuous current in this study this may be due to the wide cell compartment 4 cm most importantly the performance of the electrodialysis desalination proved that the initial fbbr was reliable for decomposing high strength wastewater and retaining 170 ml sludge prior to the final two processes the electrodialysis successfully treated the fbbr and ozonation s effluent producing water substantially free of contaminants 3 3 2 removal of nitrogen compounds nh3 n no3 n no2 the best effluent of fbbr had a considerable concentration of nh3 n no2 and no3 n at 24 h the performance could be arranged as 40 volts pulsed 40 volts 60 volts pulsed 20 volts 20 volts which is similar to their behavior in cod removal the pulsed 20 volts showed a slower removal than the continuous 20 volts while the pulsed 40 volts showed instability the pulsed 60 volts was not researched because it was expected to deliver higher instability than the pulsed 40 volts at the end of 72 h desalination it could be ranked as 40 volts pulsed 40 volts 60 volts 20 volts pulsed 20 volts for both cod and nitrogen compounds removal most of the past studies showed 90 99 maximum removal of pollutants 76 other researchers added an abundance of nutrients e g biogas slurry manure spent mushroom compost rice straw and corncob to speedup the bioremediation process 78 however this zero waste system delivered 100 removal despite its simple structure e g 4 cm wide electrodialysis compartment ordinary electrode quality the final effluent of 40 volts is called class i effluent that is suitable for drinking irrigation discharging and recycling purposes 79 in order to show the whole zero waste system performance in terms of effluent quality fig 10 presents the best performance obtained the final effluent had no nitrogen compounds and had 0 mg l cod concentration however the sample was further examined by the hach dr3900 unit to find the concentration of various ions the sample was found to have 0 mg l concentration of k ca mg mn fe b zn cu br2 cl2 o3 and so4 2 but it contained a po4 3 at a concentration of 0 6 mg l fig 11 shows the particle sizes of all the effluents of fbbr ozone oxidation and electrodialysis desalination it reveals that the remaining 0 6 mg po4 3 l had a size of 790 nm the particle sizer analysis proved that electrodialysis desalination did not contribute to decomposing the influent s pollutants despite the low availability of po4 3 the final effluent is still a first class effluent based on the regulations of water environment partnership in asia wepa the success of the zero waste system application was the result of 5 years of research in the end the zero waste system promoted the generation of biogas sludge and clean water discharge altogether biogas and biomass are valuable products from the wastewater processing capturing storing and using the biogas and the sludge can prevent global warming soil clogging marine life death and greenhouse gases emission also they can generate a large amount of revenue with biogas providing heat and power and sludge providing fertilizer for agriculture eventually operating costs could be reduced and profits possibly generated in short the zero waste system could turn wastewater plants into energy producers instead of being consumers it could also be used in the future studies for selective removal or selective recovery of ions the zero waste system can be considered a sustainable process since it results in added value by products it delivered 100 removal of contaminants despite its simple structure and the high strength influent used which is a promising result for wastewater processing 4 conclusions this study introduced the zero waste system comprised of fbbr ozone oxidation and electrodialysis desalination for wastewater sustainability the system was researched to produce clean water from any level of contamination biogas and biomass were also generated as valuable products from the fbbr biodegradation influent and test samples were analyzed in terms of cod nh3 n no2 and no3 n the zero waste system including micro media fbbr ozonation at 15 mg l ozone dose and 40 volts powered electrodialysis produced a first class effluent that was 100 cleared of cod nitrogen compounds k ca mg mn fe b zn cu br2 cl2 o3 and so4 2 the final effluent is suitable for drinking irrigation discharging and recycling purposes in the end the generated clean water could contribute to protecting the ecosystem from viruses and superbugs evolution biogas emission and soil clogging the system

13793,wastewater processing mediates industrial and domestic wastes and supports societal ecological and economic values unfortunately no single process alone is able to sustain wastewater processing thus a zero waste system was devised combining fixed bed biofilm reactor fbbr ozonation and electrodialysis to treat palm oil mill effluent pome the pome pollutants were biodegraded into smaller molecules inside the fbbr this bioreactor was fully packed with micro media ultra media kaldnes k1 micro and green ammonia absorption stones during the biodegradation biogas and biomass were generated as valuable products ozonation oxidized all the fbbr effluents at an ozone dose of 15 mg l for 24 h before being discharged for electrodialysis because bioremediation definitely does not decompose all suspended solids then the electrodialysis received the ozonated effluents and electrically separated these biodegraded substances the effluents of fbbr ozonation and electrodialysis were analyzed to find the chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen ammonia nh3 n nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 n concentrations the zero waste system involving micro media fbbr ozonation and 40 volts electrodialysis successfully produced a first class effluent that had 0 mg cod l and 0 mg l nitrogen compounds in addition it had a 0 mg l concentration of k ca mg mn fe b zn cu br2 cl2 o3 and so4 2 so the effluent would be expected to be appropriate for drinking irrigation discharging and recycling purposes this integrated process achieved excellent wastewater treatment and thus could improve the ecosystem keywords fixed bed biofilm reactor fbbr biofilm carriers electrodialysis desalination zero waste system ozonation 1 introduction since the 1970s water pollution has become an increasingly serious environmental issue due to the excessive discharge of organics phosphorous and nitrogen substances 1 nitrogen containing compounds cause eutrophication methemoglobinemia and various forms of cancer 1 4 the world health organization who the united states environmental protection agency usepa the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes and in europe the urban wastewater treatment directive 91 271 eec set the maximum admissible concentration to about 0 91 mg no2 n l and 10 0 mg no3 n l for drinking water standards and 1 0 mg nh4 n l for eﬄuent 5 thus the removal of total nitrogen i e nitrogen ammonia nitrate and nitrite has become one of the hot subjects in the research ﬁeld of wastewater treatment over the decades various technologies e g membrane ﬁltration electrochemical oxidation land disposal biological treatment have been developed to remove impurities from wastewater 6 9 however chemical and physical processes are unable to entirely remove small suspended oil particles and dissolved elements chemical treatments also may generate harmful sludge biological treatments can be inexpensive eco friendly and cooperate better with various other operations 10 microorganisms degrade transform and chelate various toxic pollutants by using them as a source of carbon and energy the end result is the transformation of wastewater contaminants into harmless or less toxic forms however heavy metals cannot be destroyed or be transformed from one complex state to another biologically such processing only changes their water solubility and decreases their toxicity biological treatments can have unstable performance generate emissions of greenhouse gases and deliver deficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal so a more advanced system is needed to deliver complete wastewater treatment and produce the desired effluent water quality sajjad al amshawee hypothesized a system comprised of a fixed bed biofilm reactor fbbr ozonation and electrodialysis desalination to treat strong wastewater this integrated system was named zero waste system the system was custom made and operated as a reliable and efficient wastewater system the zero waste system was proposed to act as a finishing wastewater strategy and it was investigated with actual wastewater involving various contaminates to find what quality of water was produced ozone oxidized the fbbr effluents before they were discharged for electrodialysis because the fbbr alone could not degrade all influent suspended solids this paper introduces the zero waste system and demonstrates its ability to generate clean water biogas and sludge it also demonstrates the possibility and effectiveness of integrating fbbr with ozonation and electrodialysis desalination the efficiency of the zero waste system was analyzed in terms of removing chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrogen compounds 2 materials and methods 2 1 zero waste system construction the zero waste system was made to decompose wastewater pollutants without any added chemicals and be flexible in handling different feeds it is comprised of fbbr ozone oxidation and electrodialysis desalination see fig 1 the fbbr and the electrodialysis stack were custom made table 1 details the specifications of the zero waste system kaldnes k1 micro green ammonia absorption stones micro media and ultra media have been selected as biofilm carriers to immobilize suspended biomass inside the fbbr see fig 2 micro media and ultra media are new designs of biofilm carriers that have been introduced by al amshawee et al 11 to boost the entrapment of biofilm in addition micro media and ultra media have rough surfaces to prevent biofilm disruption leading to stable and predictable biological performance the fbbr performance was studied with 100 packing rate of micro media 80 pieces ultra media 10 pieces kaldnes k1 micro 1650 pieces and green ammonia absorption stones the fbbr was seeded with sludge to allow a rapid start up with high performance and to understand the biofilm carriers behavior as it occurs in large scale industrial treatment the operating temperature was maintained constant at 35 c using a thermostatic water bath finally the bioreactor was covered with aluminum foil papers to prevent light from penetrating the reactor and disturbing the microorganisms it was also equipped with gas tight bags at the top to collect the biogas the zero waste system started with an influent flow to the inside of fbbr microbes swim in the fbbr medium seeking appropriate surfaces to attach and grow thus a number of biofilm carriers were used to increase the surface area each piece of biocarriers serves as an active platform enhancing mass transfer and sustaining bioﬁlm growth it results in the formation of a sheltered and stable bioﬁlm defending microbes from an alteration in wastewater parameters e g influent characteristics and operating procedures the formation of bioﬁlms on carriers also reduces the washout of bacterial biomass and enhances the enrichment of functional bacteria for 6 days of operating duration microbes used nutrients as energy to decompose contaminants and heavy metals meanwhile biogas and biomass were generated as valuable products capturing storing and using biogas and sludge can prevent global warming soil clogging marine life death and greenhouse gas emissions on day 7 ozone gas was generated on site using a ch ptf3ga 1 ozone generator netech environmental technology guangzhou china it was finely diffused and bubbled to the reactor bottom through a stone diffuser for maximum ozone utilization ozone was created by converting air oxygen through several processes subsequently the ozone generated was dissolved and mixed with wastewater for oxidation the reactor mixing was powered by ozone gas sparging where effluent recirculation was not used ozone could destroy nonbiodegradable and suspended solids of the fbbr effluent that had still not decomposed into small sizes at the end of day 7 the effluent from ozonation was released for further treatment by electrodialysis electrodialysis desalination is an electrically driven membrane treatment comprising electric supply electrodes and membrane films the electric current attracts a vast range of charged ions molecules and substances from the influent stream electrodialysis was utilized to treat the least contaminated effluent of fbbr at different voltages of 20 pulsed 20 40 pulsed 40 and 60 volts the pulsed current is comprised of brief bursts of direct current after the fbbr and ozonation successfully decomposed contaminants into a smaller size the electrodialysis could easily separate it and produce a high quality effluent table 1 presents most of the system specifications 2 2 palm oil mill effluent pome the fbbr was fed with 1 7 l pome and 0 17 l sludge taken from the second anaerobic pond of lkpp corporation which is located in gambang pahang malaysia it is worth mentioning that the process of lkpp corporation for pome is comprised of 7 anaerobic ponds facultative pond aeration pond and final settling pond accordingly the solution of the first anaerobic pond cannot be processed inside the fbbr because it has a too high concentration of solids the pome and the seeding sludge were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c before physical and chemical analysis table 2 shows the properties of the used influent originally using the sludge seeds of the facultative pond was proposed this pond has an abundance of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms however the operating process of the fbbr is anaerobic so there were doubts that the facultative sludge could work in the anaerobic fbbr the sludge seeds from the anaerobic ponds were chosen for cultivation 2 3 analytical methods the cod concentration of samples was measured using a hach reactor drb200 and a hach dr3900 from arachem m sdn bhd malaysia the hach dr3900 was also used to measure the concentrations of nh3 n no2 and no3 n the size of effluents particles was generally measured with using malvern zetasizer nano s90 malvern panalytical ltd united kingdom an oven memmert ipp500 germany was used to dry biofilm carriers to find attached growth biomass agbs see eq 2 finally the generated biogas was collected in a gasbag and analyzed using gas chromatography flame ionization detector gc fid agilent technologies 7890b united states with helium as the carrier gas pome and test samples were analyzed within 4 h of sampling some mathematical equations were used to clarify the results further the total nitrogen removal was estimated as follows 1 t o t a l n i t r o g e n r e m o v a l 1 n h 3 n e f f n o 2 e f f n o 3 n e f f n h 3 n i n f n o 2 i n f n o 3 n i n f x 100 where n o 2 e f f n o 3 n e f f and n h 3 n e f f are the effluent concentrations mg l while n o 2 i n f n o 3 n i n f and n h 3 n i n f are the influent concentrations mg l attached growth biomass agbs was only estimated for micro media ultra media and kaldnes k1 micro since they have a uniform design the green ammonia absorption stones had irregular shapes and sizes the agbs g g carrier was calculated as follows 2 a g b s m b m a m c where m a is the carrier mass dried at 105 c m b is the sum of the mass of carrier and microorganism dried at 105 c and m c is the mass of the carrier after removal of microorganisms dried at 105 c the morphology and elements of developed biofilms on the surface of biofilm carriers were examined by scanning electron microscopy sem with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx at a beam energy of 15 kv and high vacuum hitachi tm3030 japan the samples were only dried prior to sem examination without washing nor coating with a thin layer of gold 3 results and discussion the results and discussion are separated based on the process type into fbbr ozonation and electrodialysis desalination the performance is then discussed based on the analysis i e cod nitrogen compounds 3 1 fixed bed biofilm reactor fbbr the fbbr is a biological process where microbes and biomass attached to the biofilm carriers decompose most of the suspended pollutants into tiny molecules the biodegradation stops when the contaminants are in ionic form so microbes can easily absorb them as an energy source the novelty of fbbr lies in using newly designed biofilm carriers known as micro and ultra media al amshawee et al 11 discussed both designs and showed their effectiveness and uniqueness compared to a large number of other biofilm carriers 3 1 1 optimization of fixed bed biofilm reactor fbbr for efficient operation the fbbr had to be optimized either experimentally or theoretically it was decided to maximize the fbbr performance experimentally varying only the basic conditions which are flowrate packing rate and feed type the cod concentration was used to indicate the impact of changing the input variables because it describes the overall process performance future studies will explore the other changes needed to achieve excellent fbbr performance micro media was the biofilm support in all the optimization experiments and the fbbr was 100 packed i e fixed bed all the experiments used anaerobic pome as a bioreactor feed and they were operated at 35 c and 100 ml min influent flowrate 3 1 1 1 feed there were challenges expected associated with feeding the fbbr with fresh anaerobic pome little treatment efficacy with the fbbr was expected for this feed due to the high organic loading rate for this reason pome from the aerobic pond was also chosen as a feed however the aerobic pome had passed through a number of biodegradations and so was expected to produce little biogas or sludge the fbbr was set up to examine its performance in processing feeds of both aerobic and anaerobic pome when the aerobic pome was fed to the fbbr the air was pumped only on the first day to keep the conditions aerobic and continue the nitrification process anaerobic conditions were used instead of oxygen for processing the anaerobic pome the aerobic pome process was seeded with sludge from the aerobic pond while the anaerobic pond sludge was added to the anaerobic pome process the rest of the conditions were the same for both types of influent fig 3 shows the fbbr performance in processing aerobic and anaerobic pome in terms of cod fig 3 shows that the aerobic pome process was unstable and did not progress since it ended on the 6th day having a higher cod 938 mg l than its initial cod 870 mg l thus the fbbr and its micro media were not suitable to retain the aerobic pome biomass a low range of nutrients and having sludge seeds possibly impacted the process efficiency if a lower flowrate was used it could have led to a higher cod reduction but this would reduce the biogas volume and quality the use of anaerobic pome as fbbr feed was auspicious it resulted in a rapid start up and excellent cod reduction unlike the aerobic pome processing the anaerobic pome process had unstable performance only on day 4 where cod increased from 2071 mg l at day 3 to 2170 mg l while the aerobic pome had an unstable performance during most of the treatment period on the 5th day the anaerobic pome became yellowish or light brown while the aerobic pome did not change the anaerobic pome process ended with 83 cod removal rate while the aerobic pome process failed to reduce the cod concentration for these reasons the fbbr was subsequently fed with anaerobic pome for the sake of promoting a sustainable treatment if the small biofilm carriers are ineffective at a given influent flow the larger ones e g ultra media should succeed in treating anaerobic pome 3 1 1 2 fixed vs moving bed a large number of past studies have reported success in using a moving bed and called not to use a fixed bed 12 the fixed bed has been reported to be prone to biological and physical clogging which can stop the treatment the present study does not agree with these past investigations since the fbbr performance is greatly dependent on carrier efficiency to retain biomass the effectiveness of biofilm carriers primarily determines fbbr performance in order to prove this hypothesis an experiment was run using a 100 packing rate i e fixed bed and a 50 packing rate i e moving bed of micro media fig 4 presents the performance of the 100 and 50 packing rates on day 1 of the moving bed process all of the pump pipes and sieve layer clogged with biomass turbulences possibly mixed the sludge seeds significantly with the influent the moving bed also allowed poor retention of biomass and solids inside the bioreactor therefore the pump voltage had to be increased from 6 to 12 volts to avoid clogging eventually the pump recirculated the effluent but with difficulties fig 4 shows that the 50 packing rate delivered a worse performance than the 100 packing rate the 100 packing rate gave a more rapid start up and produced a higher quality effluent of 1750 mg l on the 6th day in contrast the 50 packing rate delivered a lower quality effluent of 2470 mg l on the 6th day after the experiments were ended it was observed that the moving biofilm carriers possessed more biofilm growth covering all outer surfaces than the fixed bed carriers however cod is the main metric for indicating process performance in sum the fixed bed delivered better performance and effluent quality 3 1 1 3 influent flowrate influent flowrate was examined due to its impact on biomass immobilization high flowrates can create turbulence which easily disturbs biomass immobilization and wipe out developed biofilms low flowrates can fail to homogenize the bioreactor medium and ineffectively deliver nutrients to attached biofilms eventually low flowrates create a large number of dead spots fig 5 displays the fbbr performance at influent flowrates of 50 70 and 100 ml min during the 6 days the three flowrates showed a similar performance except at day 4 for 70 ml min flowrate this difference could have been due to adding a higher strength pome sample than usual or a higher number of suspended biomass for 70 ml min based on observation the lowest flowrate 50 ml min led to biofilm growth at the inner surfaces of pipes which slightly affected the pump efficiency unlike the higher flowrates therefore low flowrates are impractical because they might clog the pipes and even the pump with time in short fig 5 shows that a higher flowrate leads to a higher cod removal and more stable performance a higher flowrate also contributed to a higher volume and better quality of biogas production therefore 100 ml min was chosen for the standard flowrate for all the fbbr experiments 3 1 2 performance of fixed bed biofilm reactor fbbr in a past study by sajjad et al 13 of about 30 days of biological pome treatment it was noted that removal rates were optimum only at the start up this finding motivated implementing pome biological treatments for a maximum duration of 15 days if the conditions were not optimized nor controlled in the present study of fbbr all the conditions for temperature carriers and reactor were well designed a duration of 6 days was targeted to accomplish maximum pome biotreatment the properties of effluents treated by the fbbr were examined to find cod nh3 n no2 no3 n and total nitrogen removal also the biofilm carriers were examined to find agbs and biogas was volumetrically estimated and analyzed to find its quality table 3 shows the fbbr results which are categorized based on the biofilm carrier and analysis the process was anaerobic for the entire 6 days a condition known to degrade high strength wastes require a low rate of nutrients and produce biogas 14 this study is unlike past studies that had done long term wastewater treatment e g 300 days involving various conditions e g different loading rates temperature packing rate researchers believe that influent acclimation is vital 2 15 however the pome taken from the second anaerobic pond of lkpp corporation did not require any further acclimation in the fbbr because it was cultivated in its anaerobic pond therefore the biological process was initiated from the first moment this study is one of the few studies that has investigated the treatment of strong wastewater table 3 showed that all four biofilm carriers delivered a rapid removal of cod no2 no3 n nh3 n beginning the first day it does prove that acclimation will add no enhancements 3 1 2 1 biogas generation the biodegradation microorganisms e g methanogens anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox bacteria denitrifiers convert pome pollutants into biogas which is a mixture of carbon dioxide and methane and to a lesser extent hydrogen gas simultaneous removal of pome contaminants in the fbbr was associated with methane generation in fact the degradation of pome itself contributed to biogas production and also reduced the concentrations of cod and nitrogen compounds biogas generation was a complex process to predict and understand since many factors can raise or significantly reduce biogas quality and volume 16 17 the high contamination of pome indicates that a large amount of energy can be recovered however there was a concern that the high pome concentration might be toxic or inhibitory to anaerobes zheng et al 12 reported that the process complexity decides biogas generation and quality and could result in long lag phases and slow rates however the process showed biogas production at the start unlike the study of martí herrero et al 18 where biogas generation began slowly on day 20 the methane content of the generated biogas was determined by direct injection into the gas chromatography unit equipped with a thermal conductivity detector gc tcd which was described in 2 3 analytical methods the results in table 3 show the performance of biofilm carriers in terms of biogas volume as follows green ammonia absorption stones ultra media micro media kaldnes k1 micro while in terms of methane percentage as follows micro media ultra media kaldnes k1 micro green ammonia absorption stones the kaldnes k1 micro did not deliver as high biogas quality and quantity as other carriers due to insufficient mixing properties the kaldnes k1 micro has the smallest compartments compared to micro media and ultra media which significantly restricted nutrients transport to the inner voids in addition the small size of kaldnes k1 micro mostly restricted influent flow through the inner compartments which technically can be considered dead zones see fig 6 the pump occasionally was ineffective in sending the influent to the fbbr because the kaldnes k1 micro had limited free space causing solution leakage from the bioreactor future studies will install a pressure gauge to closely monitor the response of packing bed to influent flow a middle wastewater tank could also be used as an option to reduce the inner pressure the pump sends influent from the wastewater tank to the bioreactor then the excess influent gradually gets discharged back to the tank even if agitation were introduced besides recirculation to improve the mixing properties it would not significantly improve the performance of kaldnes k1 micro carrier no foam nor bubbles were seen at the surface this lack of foaming suggests that the small biofilm carrier blocked all turbulence caused by recirculation in contrast the large biofilm carriers micro and ultra media provided ample space for turbulence to occur in short small biofilm carriers could result in high biofilm growth high solids retention and poorer mixing properties in contrast large biofilm carriers resulted in lower biofilm growth lower solid retention and better mixing properties the green ammonia absorption stones were packed tighter than kaldnes k1 micro carriers but it did not cause clogging nor high inner pressure this can be explained by the fins and small compartments of kaldnes k1 micro compared to the green ammonia absorption stones which have neither green ammonia absorption stone delivered the highest volume of biogas unfortunately it produced the lowest biogas quality for two possible reasons oxygen in their pores or their oxygen generating nature eventually the oxygen with the green ammonia absorption stones lowered the anaerobic biodegradation performance micro media and ultra media produced similar quality and volume of biogas due to their appropriate size and shape see fig 6 during the experiments with these carriers a considerable amount of foam covered the fbbr surface which is concrete evidence of excellent mixing properties eventually the effluent color changed from dark black into light brown similarly pandey and sarkar 19 showed appreciable biogas generation potential with an average methane content of 48 at steady state the high pome concentration had a major impact on the biogas generation rate and quality where it slowed and limited the biodegradation rate possibly it could inhibit voids from performing biodegradation and generating biogas for instance souza et al 20 achieved low biogas generation rates despite high cod removals of 70 alvarado lassman et al 21 observed a slight decrease in methane yield and cod removal with each incremental increase in organic loading others reported that significant amounts of biogas were not recovered 22 the practice of biofilm carriers definitely influenced the produced biogas volume and quality for instance martí herrero et al 18 raised biogas generation to 44 when polyethylene terephthalate pet rings were added to the bioreactor and dutta et al 23 increased biogas production rate by 50 ml when biofilm carriers were used many operators face the challenge of not reach the promised biogas yields this is caused by common errors in traditional design methodology wong et al 24 raised the daily biogas generation from 17 79 l per day to 46 76 l per day when the organic loading rate was increased and manariotis and grigoropoulos 25 increased the conversion rate of organic matter to biogas by lowering the hydraulic retention time hrt so using accurate design improved thermal performance and high load rates is important 18 however future studies still need to clarify the precise phenomena that govern the increase of biogas production 18 also the bioreactor stability and optimum operational parameters still need to be studied pome characterized by high organic content is a source with great potential for biogas production biogas is very valuable and clean energy if properly functionalized 26 pantoja filho et al 27 used biogas as an electron donor for the simultaneous removal of ammonia and nitrate in a tertiary aerobic anoxic ﬁxed bed reactor kim et al 28 converted the generated biogas into heat energy for maintaining the moderate temperature of anaerobic mbbr efﬂuent a treatment facility can take advantage of this biogas to generate electricity in a recent study if all the pome generated in malaysia was treated by anaerobic digestion it would save 671 65 million ringgits yearly approximately us 170 000 000 year 7 studies suggest it could support about 700 000 households in malaysia 29 this zero waste system could be a promising source for biogas production and potentially could boost the renewable energy sector future studies will properly evaluate the zero waste system s potential for methane recovery from pome treatment inside the fbbr and should attract investors 3 1 2 2 removal of nitrogen compounds nh3 n no3 n no2 in general wastewaters are contaminated with various organics and inorganics where some present in the form of nh3 n these are converted into no2 and subsequently into no3 n finally nitrogen gas is produced the fbbr delivered the exact process but with various conversion rates pome had a nitrogen ammonia concentration of 800 mg l after one day of biodegradation micro media ultra media kaldnes k1 micro and green ammonia absorption stones reduced the nitrogen ammonia concentration into 387 mg l 427 mg l 445 mg l and 463 mg l respectively the same ordering micro media ultra media kaldnes k1 micro green ammonia absorption stones remained for the 2nd and 3rd day on the 4th day the nh3 n of micro media process jumped from 97 mg l to 150 mg l despite the fact there was no change in conditions strangely ultra media kaldnes k1 micro and the green ammonia absorption stones showed insignificant nh3 n removal on the same day for instance ultra media reduced nh3 n concentration from 131 mg l into 130 mg l and kaldnes k1 micro lowered nh3 n from 157 mg l to 140 mg l despite frequent reports about the long start up time of anaerobic biodegradation 30 this study delivered excellent results during the first 2 3 days the nh3 n removal continued but with irregularity i e insignificant removal rates unexpected increase in nh3 n concertation the toxic effect of the influent could possibly have destabilized the process 12 on the 6th day the biodegradation achieved 100 100 100 and 190 mg nh3 n l for micro media ultra media kaldnes k1 micro and green ammonia absorption stones respectively it means that micro media delivered a rapid start up but with time most of the carriers achieved a similar removal rate the behavior of the four biofilm carriers in removing nh3 n was similarly in removing no2 and no3 n however the green ammonia absorption stones delivered higher rates of no2 and no3 n removal than ultra media on the 6th day eq 1 was used to estimate total nitrogen removal it showed an overview of the removal performance for nh3 n no2 and no3 n combined after one day of treatment the performance level could be ranked as micro media kaldnes k1 micro ultra media green ammonia absorption stones on the 6th day all of micro media ultra media and kaldnes k1 micro reduced nh3 n concentration to a similar concentration of 100 mg l from this data it is challenging to decide which is the best carrier fortunately total nitrogen removal showed a better image where it ranked the removal efficiency as micro media kaldnes k1 micro ultra media green ammonia absorption stones most importantly the total nitrogen removal is mostly synchronized with the concentrations of nh3 n no2 and no3 n a number of wastewater bioremediations may develop inside the fbbr such as nitrification and denitrification however only anaerobic conditions were used which led to anaerobic ammonium oxidation microorganisms anammox anammox has high nitrogen removal rates and they prefer to grow in the form of bioﬁlms on the surface of carriers 31 in the anammox reaction ammonium and nitrite were converted into nitrogen gas n2 under anoxic anaerobic conditions eq 3 indicates the anammox reaction 32 in the end the utilization of anammox microorganisms in the fbbr was efﬁcient for nitrogen compounds removal 3 nh4 1 32no2 0 066hco3 0 13h 1 02n2 0 26no3 0 066ch2o0 5n0 15 2 03h2o 3 1 2 3 removal of chemical oxygen demand cod the cod concentration is a fundamental parameter for analysis it is similar to total nitrogen removal in giving an overview but it tells nothing about the pollutants it was analyzed for the four biofilm carriers during the period of biodegradation after one day of treatment the results in table 3 showed the beds performance ranking as kaldnes k1 micro micro media green ammonia absorption stones ultra media it is quite dissimilar to the nitrogen compounds removal ranking micro media ultra media kaldnes k1 micro green ammonia absorption stones and total nitrogen removal micro media kaldnes k1 micro ultra media green ammonia absorption stones in here kaldnes k1 micro was better than micro media because of its small compartments that rapidly and forcefully retained a greater number of suspended solids than the others however it is technically impractical for long term treatments kaldnes k1 micro failed to achieve a lower cod concentration than micro media on the 5th and 6th days also it had unstable cod removal as shown in table 3 on day 4 it can be postulated that the kaldnes k1 micro became clogged unfortunately cod could not explain the instability of the nitrogen compounds removal however at the end of the 6th day it showed the media performance ranking as micro media kaldnes k1 micro ultra media green ammonia absorption stones which is pretty similar to the total nitrogen removal ranking during the 6 days of anaerobic digestion the cod concentration was simultaneously reduced with the generation of biogas and retention of sludge 3 1 2 4 biofilm carriers the columnar shape of the fbbr 30 cm height 10 cm diameter was very significant in activating all the packing bed most of the influent passed through most of the packing bed which greatly distributed the nutrients to the immobilized biofilms therefore it contributed to preserving the process stability and retaining high performance for long term also recirculation made the suspended biomass contact a greater number of biofilm carriers this recirculation is needed to increase the retention of pollutants inside the fbbr at the media surfaces the better the retention performance of biomass by carriers the less recirculation is needed 33 in other words recirculation is required due to the inability of carriers to fully capture pollutants and some studies have called for the usage of settling tanks 34 all the synthetic carriers of micro media kaldnes k1 micro and ultra media were made of polymer due to pome corrosiveness this pome property means that metallic biofilm carriers are not recommended all the biofilm carriers initially act as filters to retain pollutants then the developed biofilms gradually lead to decomposition biological decomposition may be of less importance than the carrier ability to retain pollutants however bezerra et al 35 suggested that the decrease in organic matter concentration is a result of anaerobic biodegradation rather than physical chemical phenomena table 3 shows that micro media was the most superior biofilm carrier in terms of effluent quality and process stability compared to ultra media kaldnes k1 micro and green ammonia absorption stones not only did micro media provide high surface area for biofilm attachment but it also helped to prevent biofilm and biomass from escaping with the effluent ultra media has a similar shape to micro media but its larger size presented a lower total surface area of 5836 136 mm2 compared to micro media 13464 mm2 for suspended solids entrapment and biofilm growth 11 kaldnes k1 micro had a smaller size than micro media that largely failed to promote a hydrodynamic flow at the same time the green stones have only outside surface area due to not having inner compartments as the synthetic carriers do moreover the conditions used were optimized based on micro media so that the conditions used could have been impractical for the other carriers each carrier may require different flowrates filling ratios hydraulic retention times and even different temperatures during the experiments the temperature of the recycled effluent was measured it was found to be about 30 c which is less than the desired 35 c using a high filling ratio of biofilm carriers with low porosity requires heating to keep the bioreactor at a given temperature eq 2 was used to estimate the attached growth biomass agbs g g carrier for only the synthetic carriers unlike a large number of studies that randomly selected biofilm carriers for agbs testing 19 36 this study chose carriers with the highest biofilm attachment the results of agbs testing indicate that micro media immobilized more biomass than either kaldnes k1 micro or ultra media biofilm growth on carriers can vary for many different reasons one of which is unequal mixing the performance ranking as micro media kaldnes k1 micro ultra media fits well with data for agbs cod nh3 n no2 no3 n total nitrogen removal and biogas quality based on observation it is noteworthy that biofilm did not play a significant role in determining bioreactor performance however if biofilm has a proper thickness it is essential for a long term process few studies of biofilm carriers in terms of design shape and roughness have been published 5 37 38 even with the findings of this study it is still not possible to deliver a detailed theory specifying the perfect carrier however this study in general finds the perfect carrier has 1 a suitable size to effectively immobilize biomass 2 fins corrugations as in micro media and ultra media to prevent biofilm from detachment and 3 an appropriate shape to allow mixing and nutrient transport future studies may design biofilm carriers in the shape of a unified bed rather than the addition of a number of carriers see fig 7 the unified bed will tremendously help in studying a bed s ability to retain influent contaminants in unpublished previous research kaldnes k1 micro delivered a better pome treatment than micro media however micro media showed a greater performance than k1 micro in this study this may be due to carrier orientation inside the bioreactor against influent flow and turbulences that led to a dissimilar entrapment of biomass and growth of biofilms however dizge et al 40 reported that the limitation of oxygen transfer is responsible for the irregular growth of biofilm fig 8 shows irregular growth on different parts of micro media the biofilm formed on the surfaces of biofilm carriers was visually observed fig 9 pictures the outgrowth of biofilm on the surface of micro media after 6 days of continuous anaerobic pome treatment the biofilm growth was tightly packed and covered all the large surface areas of micro media as shown in fig 9 on the contrary past studies have shown biofilm growth on only a few spots of the carrier s surfaces and reported voids and channels between many microcolonies 41 42 in here only the best biofilm carrier micro media was analyzed by sem and past studies found similar biofilm structures on different biofilm carriers 43 the growth of biofilm thus greatly depends on the influent the edx analysis recognized the presence of carbon 45 033 oxygen 47 557 magnesium 0 261 aluminum 1 657 silicon 1 960 phosphorus 0 355 sulfur 0 395 potassium 0 535 calcium 0 779 titanium 0 379 and iron 1 089 as the dominant components in the attached biofilm similar findings were reported by garrido baserba et al 44 fig 9 shows that the suspended biomass accumulated and formed a dense biofilm on the surface of micro media the dense growth of biofilms on the surfaces of micro media definitely involved aggregates of cells as past studies have reported 45 these microbial aggregates play an important role in retaining the acclimatized microflora on the carrier s surfaces eventually this high density biomass formed a rich biofilm and improved the degradation efficiency however the majority of pollutant removal was accounted for by the effectiveness of the carrier s design in entrapping suspended biomass recent studies such as wang et al 46 work have extensively investigated the formation of biofilm on various surfaces of biofilm carriers without considering the carrier s design as shown in the sem images fig 9 the biofilms had rough surfaces with a microporous structure which could be used as an efficient surface for the immobilization of suspended pollutants from aqueous solution similar morphologies were found in past studies acar and dincer 47 reported similar biofilm morphologies of fig 9 on a rigid high density polyethylene mesh hdpe after 90 days of operation and the developed biofilms were called mature when other studies examined the biofilm s growth at 10 30 days the growth was found insignificant 48 50 however dizge et al 51 reported rapid growth of biofilm during 1 10 days of wastewater treatment when a high strength influent with mixed liquor suspended solids of 1000 32 8 mg l was used the study undertaken by dizge et al 51 is in line with the present study that duration of biofilm growth greatly dependent on the influent strength heavy loaded influents promote a biofilm growth with a different morphology from unloaded samples ahmad et al 52 confirmed the formation of porous biofilm on biofilm carrier s surfaces fig 9a shows dense and evenly spread bioﬁlms on the carrier s surface at a magnification scale of 1 mm which is similar to what was reported by hwang et al 53 and zhang et al 54 surprisingly the biofilm growth shown in fig 9 is much similar to biofilm growth on the membrane surfaces of a submerged membrane bioreactor in the treatment of synthetic municipal sewage 55 however when páca et al 56 developed biofilms in a packed bed reactor during aerobic conditions the produced biofilm was similar to fig 9c but it missed the micropores it means that the pattern of bioﬁlm expansion is different under anaerobic and aerobic conditions fig 9 displayed varied and well developed pores the porous structure is beneficial for the penetration of nutrient and the discharge of produced gas and sludge 3 1 2 5 sludge production the fbbr of zero waste system was not analyzed in terms of sludge production because fresh sludge seeds from pome treatment plant was used sections 2 1 2 2 so this section discusses the fbbr behavior in producing sludge studies have competed for decades to promote efficient treatment processes associated with low sludge production most of past studies promoted anaerobic digestion due to its low sludge production 23 they even promoted fbbr or attached growth bioreactor for low excess sludge production 57 58 studies also discussed anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox to give 90 less sludge production 59 60 other systems were also introduced to largely retain sludge such as membrane bioreactor mbr 61 these systems have not been developed to harvest or cultivate by products all the systems were analyzed in terms of feasibility and economics for lower operating costs energy consumption and sludge production the fbbr of zero waste system promotes sludge generation unlike past studies that considered sludge production to be an environment risk and to negatively impact wastewater treatment 58 62 if sludge led to technical problems then biofilm carriers and reactor design have to be advanced to deliver excellent sludge settling ability and prevent sludge bulking for instance tabassum et al 63 detected sludge contents in the 4th reactor effluent due to the failure of first 3 reactors to retain sludge in section 3 1 2 1 it was demonstrated that biogas was generated but not as much as reported in many studies 24 the incomplete conversion of carbon substrates to biogas is due to the lack of organic compounds which leads to incomplete degradation of nitrogen contaminants and results in biomass sludge production 64 65 sludge production in the anaerobic reactors may be attributed to ﬂocculation of nonbiodegradable particulate matter forming an inert sludge mass fraction and a biological sludge mass that is generated as a result of anaerobic conversion 66 the production rate of sludge is proportional to the strength of the influent where it requires high amounts of carbon substrate the feed pome has a wide range of pollutant concentrations e g 8680 mg cod l where the addition of external carbon or a high loading rate of more substrate can potentially cause excess sludge production and gradually increase cod concentration 67 68 thanks to the fbbr no sludge recycling is needed and the produced sludge is retained inside the bioreactor alvarado lassman et al 21 observed a signiﬁcant increment in biomass production during the first 12 days using 70 g cod l loading rate despite the fact that anaerobic digestion creates low sludge production with a low energy requirement compared to aerobic digestion 19 it would be valuable for a long term process where the accumulated sludge will stabilize the process performance and microbial community it would also generate biogas from decomposing complex biomass retained at the bioreactor s bottom sludge can cause membrane fouling and short circuiting as reported by a large number of studies 69 71 but it aided in the fbbr process derakhshan et al 72 recorded a lower stabilization ratio when the process produced less sludge the zero waste system is unlike other treatment processes because it favors an ultimate balance between biogas generation and sludge production the generated sludge can be easily dewatered and does not require extensive post treatment 22 on the other hand previous studies have focused on only producing clean water without giving attention to clean energy from wastewater 3 2 ozone oxidation ozone was proposed because it is a very reactive oxidizing agent and can effectively deactivate e coli and gram negative bacteria e g legionella 73 74 technically ozone reacts with inert solids oxidizing and transforming them to a biodegradable form it can enhance the general biodegradation reduce sludge production significantly without shutting down the bioreactor and even improve the dead biomass decomposition in terms of costs ozonation operating cost for treatment of both wastewater and sludge is only us 0 0115 m3 75 if oxygen was used it would not lead to significant changes because it is a weak oxidant and always tends to escape in shape of bubbles the very slow consumption of oxygen is strong evidence of its poor impact on biodegradation also using oxygen as an oxidant requires energy and capital costs and delivers a slow and poor cod removal therefore ozone replaced oxygen to reduce the treatment duration and increase the effluent quality ozone was introduced to the fbbr effluent to aid in decomposing the remaining contaminants and to keep the conductivity in a high range also the ozonation effluent will need a short duration for solid deposition at the reactor bottom before getting discharged to the electrodialysis after ozonation the effluent will have only ions or tiny pollutants and electrodialysis will have no technical problem in processing it in order to implement comparable conditions for all fbbr effluents ozone oxidation was applied at a flowrate of 0 5 l min for 24 h for all the fbbr effluents based on the manufacturer notes of ch ptf3ga 1 ozone generator the 0 5 l min air flowrate generated an ozone dose of 15 mg l table 4 presents the results of cod nh3 n no2 and no3 n analysis for fbbr effluents before and after ozonation ozone oxidation changed the original 100 100 and 100 mg nh3 n l from micro media ultra media and kaldnes k1 micro carrier treatment to 14 70 and 120 mg nh3 n l respectively the lowest final concentration of nh3 n 14 mg l is clear evidence of the superior performance of the micro media compared to the other carriers the green ammonia absorption stones delivered the second best effluent after the micro media it delivered lower cod concentration 1217 mg l than kaldnes k1 micro 2050 mg l and ultra media 2120 mg l these findings are in good agreement with the removal of nitrogen compounds the reduced pollutants size presumably enabled ozone to effectively abate it on the other hand after ozonating the effluent of k1 micro it showed the worst no2 and no3 n concentrations compared to other effluents apparently k1 micro fbbr was not efficient in degrading pome contaminants 3 3 electrodialysis desalination the electrodialysis unit was made of compartments 4 cm wide to successfully treat the highly polluted pome and avoid having spacer clogging the impact of continuous and pulsed currents was researched at different voltages the pulsed current was applied with a frequency of 21 08 khz due to the lack of time and resources the ozonated micro media fbbr effluent as the highest quality effluent was the only influent chosen to be processed by electrodialysis desalination table 5 shows the results of the electrodialysis desalinating the ozonated micro media fbbr effluent 3 3 1 removal of chemical oxygen demand cod the electrodialysis desalination was investigated under 20 pulsed 20 40 pulsed 40 and 60 volts each run lasted for 3 days 72 h where sampling was made each 24 h table 5 shows that the electrodialysis is uncomplex compared to fbbr where it electrically removed the charged pollutants for cod removal it was effective in processing strong wastewater of 938 mg cod l after 24 h its performance for cod removal could be arranged as 40 volts pulsed 40 volts 60 volts pulsed 20 volts 20 volts the 20 volts treatment possibly needed a longer time to deliver similar removal rates compared to the 40 volts in conclusion high voltages required a shorter duration to remove the same number of ions compared to low voltages however 60 volts demonstrated a worse performance than 40 volts and pulsed 40 volts thus 40 volts was the optimal and any further increase in voltage did not increase ion transport 76 at 24 h the results showed that pulsed 20 volts delivered a higher cod removal than 20 volts on the other hand 40 volts achieved a higher cod removal than pulsed 40 volts the pulsed current was better at lower voltages than the optimal voltage but it could not accomplish the same performance as continuous current after 24 h however after 72 h 20 volts accomplished a much higher cod removal 45 mg l than pulsed 20 volts 97 mg l based on observation pulsed operation took a longer duration to remove dilute color than the continuous current however pulsed and continuous current performed similarly at low voltages the cod concentration increased from 0 mg l at the 48 h to 1 mg l at the 72 h during the pulsed 40 volts showing its effectiveness to be less consistent also it increased from 91 mg l at the 48 h to 97 mg l at the 72 h during the pulsed 20 volts in the end the 40 volts that delivered the best start up showed the best effluent with 0 mg cod l with only 24 h of electrodialysis recent studies have reported that pulsed current was very effective 77 however the pulsed current did not perform as well as the continuous current in this study this may be due to the wide cell compartment 4 cm most importantly the performance of the electrodialysis desalination proved that the initial fbbr was reliable for decomposing high strength wastewater and retaining 170 ml sludge prior to the final two processes the electrodialysis successfully treated the fbbr and ozonation s effluent producing water substantially free of contaminants 3 3 2 removal of nitrogen compounds nh3 n no3 n no2 the best effluent of fbbr had a considerable concentration of nh3 n no2 and no3 n at 24 h the performance could be arranged as 40 volts pulsed 40 volts 60 volts pulsed 20 volts 20 volts which is similar to their behavior in cod removal the pulsed 20 volts showed a slower removal than the continuous 20 volts while the pulsed 40 volts showed instability the pulsed 60 volts was not researched because it was expected to deliver higher instability than the pulsed 40 volts at the end of 72 h desalination it could be ranked as 40 volts pulsed 40 volts 60 volts 20 volts pulsed 20 volts for both cod and nitrogen compounds removal most of the past studies showed 90 99 maximum removal of pollutants 76 other researchers added an abundance of nutrients e g biogas slurry manure spent mushroom compost rice straw and corncob to speedup the bioremediation process 78 however this zero waste system delivered 100 removal despite its simple structure e g 4 cm wide electrodialysis compartment ordinary electrode quality the final effluent of 40 volts is called class i effluent that is suitable for drinking irrigation discharging and recycling purposes 79 in order to show the whole zero waste system performance in terms of effluent quality fig 10 presents the best performance obtained the final effluent had no nitrogen compounds and had 0 mg l cod concentration however the sample was further examined by the hach dr3900 unit to find the concentration of various ions the sample was found to have 0 mg l concentration of k ca mg mn fe b zn cu br2 cl2 o3 and so4 2 but it contained a po4 3 at a concentration of 0 6 mg l fig 11 shows the particle sizes of all the effluents of fbbr ozone oxidation and electrodialysis desalination it reveals that the remaining 0 6 mg po4 3 l had a size of 790 nm the particle sizer analysis proved that electrodialysis desalination did not contribute to decomposing the influent s pollutants despite the low availability of po4 3 the final effluent is still a first class effluent based on the regulations of water environment partnership in asia wepa the success of the zero waste system application was the result of 5 years of research in the end the zero waste system promoted the generation of biogas sludge and clean water discharge altogether biogas and biomass are valuable products from the wastewater processing capturing storing and using the biogas and the sludge can prevent global warming soil clogging marine life death and greenhouse gases emission also they can generate a large amount of revenue with biogas providing heat and power and sludge providing fertilizer for agriculture eventually operating costs could be reduced and profits possibly generated in short the zero waste system could turn wastewater plants into energy producers instead of being consumers it could also be used in the future studies for selective removal or selective recovery of ions the zero waste system can be considered a sustainable process since it results in added value by products it delivered 100 removal of contaminants despite its simple structure and the high strength influent used which is a promising result for wastewater processing 4 conclusions this study introduced the zero waste system comprised of fbbr ozone oxidation and electrodialysis desalination for wastewater sustainability the system was researched to produce clean water from any level of contamination biogas and biomass were also generated as valuable products from the fbbr biodegradation influent and test samples were analyzed in terms of cod nh3 n no2 and no3 n the zero waste system including micro media fbbr ozonation at 15 mg l ozone dose and 40 volts powered electrodialysis produced a first class effluent that was 100 cleared of cod nitrogen compounds k ca mg mn fe b zn cu br2 cl2 o3 and so4 2 the final effluent is suitable for drinking irrigation discharging and recycling purposes in the end the generated clean water could contribute to protecting the ecosystem from viruses and superbugs evolution biogas emission and soil clogging the system achieved zero waste by transforming wastewater contaminants into valuable products i e clean water biogas biomass and facilitated recovery of those valuable products with simultaneous treatment of wastewater thus it paves a way towards cleaner and greener environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgment the great

13794,in this research with the aim of achieving a high flux and rejection of cephalexin antibiotic simultaneously separate modifications were performed on the membrane top layer selective layer and substrate layer support layer fe3o4 fe and zro2 zr nanoparticles were synthesized for modifying the pan support layer while fe3o4 zro2 fz nanoparticles were synthesized for modifying the pa top layer in this regard five types of nanocomposite membranes were synthesized in order to regulate the porosity of the support layer p a f e 2 p a n and p a z r 2 p a n membranes were synthesized which showed more pores number compared to p a p a n membrane in order to enhance the surface hydrophilicity f z 2 p a p a n membrane was synthesized which showed around 16 lower contact angle and 58 greater roughness compared to p a p a n membrane in order to compensate for the roughness developed on the membrane surface concurrent modifications were performed on the top and support layers the f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membranes were synthesized which separated cephalexin by 91 and 95 8 comparison of the performance of the synthesized membrane with that of commercial filmtec nf270 2450 membrane showed that the cephalexin rejection 95 1 and flux recovery 99 1 of f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n are almost the same as cephalexin rejection 98 1 and flux recovery 96 1 of commercial membrane from permeation point of view f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membrane at transmembrane pressure of 4 bar and cross flow velocity of 0 5 m s had a water flux of 49 l m2 h and cephalexin flux of 38 l m2 h while nf270 2450 at the same condition had a water flux of 42 l m2 h and cephalexin flux of 25 l m2 h keywords nanocomposite membrane cephalexin fe3o4 nanoparticle zro2 nanoparticle 1 introduction today presence of pharmaceutical pollutants in the nature has caused different environmental problems and alteration of ecosystems 1 some drugs such as antibiotics are not biodegradable and create drug resistance for this reason their separation is essential 2 in recent years various studies have been performed on the synthesis of nanocomposite membranes in order to separate antibiotics 3 in recent research on achieving a membrane with a satisfactory separation performance either the flux or the rejection membrane has improved 4 6 in the synthesis of nanocomposite membranes various modifiers have been used including carbon nanotubes nanofibers nanosheets and nanoparticles 7 8 metal and metal oxide nanoparticles enjoy greater priority compared to other modifiers thanks to their easy preparation and reasonable price 9 so far various nanoparticles such as sio2 fe3o4 zno zro2 and tio2 have been used to modify the performance of polymer membranes 10 studies suggest that in addition to the type of the nanoparticles used the site of loading of nanoparticles in the membrane matrix also significantly influences the filtration performance and structural properties of the membrane 9 nanoparticles can be combined with the polymer matrix of the support layer or be added as modifiers only to the top layer of the membrane modification of support layer through porosity adjustment and modification of top layer through hydrophilicity enhancement improve membrane permeation the main advantage of nanoparticles loading in support and top layer is uniform dispersion of nanoparticles in support layer and low consumption of nanoparticles in top layer low effectiveness on selectivity is a disadvantage of nanoparticles loading in support layer and low impact on overall structure is the main drawback of nanoparticles loading in top layer considering addition of nanoparticles across the membrane top layer wu et al 11 synthesized s i o 2 p a p s f tfn nf membrane to achieve 1 5 times greater flux and 9 reduction in salt separation khajouei et al 12 also employed in situ synthesis of zero valent iron nanoparticles in superficial polyamide layer of f e 0 p a p s f tfn nf membrane and achieved 1 3 increase in nacl separation as well as 26 growth in the water flux elsewhere by synthesizing r g o t i o 2 p a p e s tfn ro membrane safarpour et al 13 managed to enhance the flux by 49 and increase the salt separation by 2 also regarding loading nanoparticles in the membrane support layer mollahosseini et al 14 synthesized p a t i o 2 p s f tfc nf membrane and observed 277 increase in the water flux compared to the raw membrane note that presence of nanoparticles increased salt rejection by 13 also dong et al 15 by synthesizing p a z e o l i t e p s f tfc nf membrane achieved 195 increase in water flux and decreased nacl and mgso4 separation by 3 and 19 respectively investigations indicated that addition of nanoparticles to the top layer generally leads to enhanced surface hydrophilicity thereby improving the permeation flux however it also leads to increased roughness of the membrane surface on the other hand addition of nanoparticles to the support layer generally causes enhanced hydrophilicity and porosity thereby significantly improving the flux yet it leads to a slight increase or even reduction of membrane separation therefore it seems that presence of nanoparticles in both the top and support layers could develop a synergistic effect in improving the structure superficial properties and filtration behavior of membranes according to the literature so far limited studies have been performed regarding application of nanoparticles in both top and support layers of membrane in which similar nanostructures have been used in the top and support layers in a study chae et al 16 employed graphene oxide nanosheets in both membrane layers g o p a g o p s f tfc ro membrane showed only 7 increase in salt separation while it caused 69 reduction in the membrane flux in another study 17 z e o l i t e p a z e o l i t e p s f tfc ro membrane was synthesized where 68 increase and only 8 growth were observed in flux and salt separation respectively thus considering the different objectives of interest for modifying the top and support layers it seems that use of different nanoparticles with complementary features in both layers of the membrane could be more effective in achieving a desirable membrane structure which provide simultaneous flux and rejection enhancement for antibiotic separation in this research to achieve high flux and rejection of cephalexin from wastewater simultaneously iron oxide nanoparticles were used as a porosity adjuster flux enhancer agent while zirconium oxide nanoparticles were employed as a hydrophilicity enhancer agent in the support layer based on our previous studies using fe3o4 solely in the selective layer increases surface roughness seriously 18 and using zro2 in the surface layer needs modification or functionalization to uniform dispersion 19 on the other hand using composite of fe3o4 and zro2 in core shell format donates special property to the membrane 20 therefore in order to enhance the separation efficiency reduce the surface roughness and mitigate the fouling iron oxide and zirconium nanoparticles were concurrently used in the form of fe3o4 zro2 core shell nanoparticles in the top layer of the membrane finally bilayer nanocomposite membranes f z p a z r p a n and f z p a f e p a n were used to separate cephalexin from a synthetic effluent eventually the performance of the synthesized membranes was compared to that of a commercial filmtec nf270 2450 membrane 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyacrylonitrile pan polymer with a molecular weight of 10 200 g mol was prepared from khoob textile company kashan iran and was used as the base polymer to synthesize the membrane dimethylformamide dmf solvent made by merck germany was employed as the solvent in the stages of membrane synthesis also cephalexin with a molecular weight of 347 39 g mol farabi pharmaceutical co isfahan iran was used as the pollutant in the membrane filtration test in addition trimesoyl chloride tmc and m phenylenediamine mpd made by merck germany were utilized as the constituent monomers of the polyamide layer throughout the interfacial polymerization process normal hexane n hexane made by merck co germany was also applied as the tmc solvent polyethylene glycol peg with molecular weights of 200 400 600 and 800 g mole were prepared from merck company and were used for molecular weight cut off mwco measurement zro2 nanoparticles were synthesized by polymeric sol gel method 21 and fe3o4 nanoparticles were synthesized by microwave assisted method 22 then as prepared fe3o4 nanoparticles were used as a core and a shell of zro2 nanoparticles were coated on the fe3o4 seeds as reported by noormohamadi et al 23 synthesized nanoparticles were employed in the membrane synthesis process 2 2 methods 2 2 1 synthesis of composite and nanocomposite membranes the membranes utilized in this research include composite membranes with pan support layer and polyamide top layer the support layer was synthesized through phase inversion process while the top layer was made during the interfacial polymerization process in order to synthesize the pan support layer first pan polymer was added to dmf under constant stirring and heating at 110 c until achieving the concentration of 15 wt next the prepared polymer solution was cast on a glass surface uniformly by a casting knife in the form of a film with a thickness of 500 μm the polymer film was placed inside a non solvent bath water for 24 h so that through the exchange between the solvent and non solvent the pan membrane would be prepared in order to synthesize the nanocomposite membranes first a specific concentration of zro2 or fe3o4 nanoparticles was added to the dmf solvent next for uniform dispersion of nanoparticles in the solution it was placed inside an ultrasonic bath for 1 h at 70 c next pan was added to the mixture of nanoparticles and dmf in order to synthesize the polyamide top layer through the interfacial polymerization method first an aqueous solution containing 0 075 w v of mpd monomer in water was prepared next the pan support layer was immersed in this solution for 2 min in the next stage a solution of the tmc monomer was prepared in n hexane solvent with a concentration of 0 2 w v next the membrane smeared with amine solution was placed 2 min in tmc solution then withdrawn and further placed inside an oven at 50 c for 6 min in this way the reaction between amine and tmc could be completed and a thin layer of polyamide would form on the pan ultrafiltration membrane surface to synthesize the polyamide nanocomposite layer after dispersion of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles with a specific concentration in water mpd monomer with weight percentage of 0 075 w v was added to the solution and other stages were performed as with the method explained above from among the factors affecting the structure of pan ultrafiltration membrane all characteristics of the membrane synthesis stage of the support layer were considered as constant according to experience of previous research 19 23 while only the effect of type and concentration of nanoparticles was tested on the structure and performance of membrane filtration further in the polyamide nanofiltration layer synthesis stage according to previous studies 18 all of the synthesis variables were considered as constant and only the effect of changes in the concentration of fe3o4 zro2 in the structure of the top layer of the membrane was examined on the morphology and filtration performance of the membrane according to the screening tests the level of variables and the range of their effective changes were determined table 1 presents the membranes synthesized in this research and their synthesis conditions 2 2 2 the methods of characterizing nanoparticles and nanocomposite membranes to detect the crystalline structure of nanoparticles x ray diffraction xrd test was utilized x ray diffractometer advance d8 bruker germany also to calculate the crystalline size of the nanoparticles scherer relation was used 24 in order to observe the cross section of the membrane scanning electron microscopy sem was applied sem images in this research were prepared by sem device quanta feg 450 fei co usa to prepare sem image from nanoparticles the powders were sonicated for 30 min in order to prevent from particle agglomeration then the samples were dried gold sputtered and scanned with electron beam in sem instrument in order to identify the functional groups of nanoparticles and prove their presence in the membrane matrix fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir 6300 jasco co japan was used atomic force microscopy afm was employed to prepare topography images of the membrane surface for this purpose dme dual scope 26 germany was used in the contact mode to measure the porosity a sample of the membrane with an area of 2 cm 2 cm was withdrawn from distilled water bath then the water on its surface was dried slowly and then its wet weight was measured by a balance subsequently the surface of the membrane sample was placed inside a desiccator for 24 h in order to fully dry and the water inside the pores would be removed finally the dry weight of the membrane was also measured and using the following relation the extent of membrane porosity was calculated 25 1 e w w w d ρ w v where ww and wd represent the weight of the sample in wet and dry states g v shows the volume of the sample cm3 and ρw denotes the water density g cm 3 next using the relations known as guerout elford ferry relation the size of the pores was estimated 25 2 r p 2 9 1 75 ε 8 η q l ε a δ p where η denotes the water viscosity 8 9 10 4 pa s l is the film thickness m q denotes the volume flow rate m3 s 1 ε is the membrane porosity a shows the effective surface area m2 and δp is the operational pressure to determine the number of membrane pores the following relation was used 26 3 n ε a π d 2 4 where a represents the area of utilized membrane ε reflects the membrane porosity d is the diameter of membrane pores and n shows the number of membrane pores the extent of tortuosity of membrane pores is also calculated by the following equation 25 4 t o r t u s i t y τ 2 e 2 e this simplified equation is in agreement with the membranes made by phase inversion process 27 29 along with a thin film over the thick support 30 the zero point charge phzpc of the membrane drug sample and nanoparticles was determined by ph drift method 31 to this end 50 mg of each sample nanoparticle drug or membrane has been added to five solutions with different phs 2 4 6 8 and 10 after 24 h the final ph of solutions was measured for this purpose ph meter metrohm switzerland was used the final ph was plotted against initial ph the point at which the plotted curve intersected y x line was considered as point of zero charge 31 in order to determine the membrane contact angle 1 μl of water was dropped gently on the membrane surface by a micropipette then the image of this drop was recorded by nikon d7000 japan the images were analyzed by image processing software and the contact angle between the water drop and membrane surface was measured the contact angle value of θ 90 degrees represents the surface having the affinity toward the water indeed the surface is normally called as hydrophilic 32 2 2 3 filtration tests in cross flow module the experimental setup used in this research consists of a crossflow filtration system plus a module with an effective surface area of 24 32 cm2 the filtration in this system was performed at the pressure of 4 bar crossflow velocity cfv of 0 5 m s and temperature of 25 1 c fig 1 demonstrates the schematic map of this filtration system in this filtration system the container for collecting the permeate sample is placed on the balance connected to the computer the permeate weight was monitored and recorded at different times in order to be used for calculating the flux by relation 5 33 5 j v a t where v represents the volume of water passing through the membrane l a shows the membrane surface area m2 and t denotes the time of using the membrane h to measure the extent of pollutant separation by the membrane a synthetic effluent containing 50 ppm of cephalexin pharmaceutical pollutant mw 347 39 g mol phpzc 4 3 ph 5 3 was prepared and then filtered by the synthesized membranes next the separation percentage was calculated by the following relation 7 6 r c f c p c f 100 where cp shows the pollutant concentration in the flow passed and cf indicates the pollutant concentration in the input feed the pollutant concentration was measured by spectrophotometer jasco v570 at the wavelength of 261 nm in order to determine the membrane pore size molecular weight cut off mwco analysis was performed to perform this analysis solutions of peg 200 peg 400 peg 600 and peg 800 at a concentration of 4 g l were prepared the solutions were filtered by the synthesized membranes and the concentration of permeate and feed were measured using toc analyzer analytic jena multi n c series and co2 ndir detector the molecular weight corresponding to 90 rejection was reported as mwco 34 comparison of the antifouling behavior of the membrane across different states was performed by flux recovery ratio frr feature 33 the antifouling experiment was performed in four stages 35 36 at the first stage the system was operated for filtration of deionized water at cross flow velocity of 0 5 m s for 30 min and flux was recorded as j1 at the second stage filtration of the 50 ppm cephalexin solution was performed for 30 min at cross flow velocity of 0 5 m s at the third stage the membrane was cleaned using deionized water for 30 min at the circulation flow rate of 1 3 m s at the fourth stage the filtration of deionized water was conducted for 30 min at cross flow velocity of 0 5 m s and water flux was recorded as j2 the flux recovery ratio was calculated through relation 7 37 7 f r r j 2 j 1 100 where j1 indicates the initial flux with distilled water feed and j2 denotes the secondary flux with distilled water feed the filtration performance of the synthesized membranes was compared with that of a filmtec commercial membrane nf270 2540 model 3 results and discussion in this research first the utilized nanoparticles were characterized with xrd and sem analyses next the nanocomposite membranes were evaluated in terms of chemical composition through ftir analysis superficial properties by afm contact angle and pzc analyses and structural characteristics by mwco sem edx analysis and pores properties in order to investigate the filtration behavior of synthesized membranes flux rejection and flux recovery ratio analyses were also performed finally the performance of synthesized membranes was compared to commercial filmtec nf270 2450 membrane 3 1 characterization of fe3o4 zro2 zro2 fe3o4 nanoparticles in order to investigate the crystalline structure of nanoparticles xrd spectrum of the nanoparticles samples is shown in fig 2 based on the presented xrd patterns the spectrum related to fe3o4 nanoparticles corresponds with the jcpds cards no 00 001 1111 38 and that of the zro2 nanoparticles fits the jcpds cards no 00 007 0343 39 based on the pattern of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles it is observed that the peak found at 2θ equal to 30 and 58 can correspond with fe3o4 pattern and the peaks indicated at 2θ of 35 and 68 match the zro2 pattern further using the scherer relation the crystalline size for the fe3o4 zro2 and fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles was determined as 26 23 and 53 nm respectively expectedly the crystalline size of the fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles is larger because of having a core shell structure and presence of both fe3o4 and zro2 nanoparticles in its structure to further investigate the morphological characteristics of the nanoparticles sem analysis presented in fig 3 was performed according to the sem images in fig 3 the average sizes of zro2 fe3o4 and fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles are 29 4 37 and 41 nm respectively the size distribution for the zro2 fe3o4 and fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles lies within the ranges of 0 40 nm 10 40 nm and 10 50 nm respectively iron oxide nanoparticles due to their larger size than zirconia oxide nanoparticles have lower surface energy which are less prone to aggregation 40 thus fe3o4 nanoparticles have a more uniform size distribution which indicates greater uniformity moreover the surfactant agent used in synthesis of fe3o4 22 prevents particle aggregation while in the method used for zro2 and fe3o4 zro2 no surfactant has been utilized 21 therefore fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles have more particle aggregation in spite of larger size than fe3o4 it is also observed that for fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles particles larger than 60 nm are also reported which is in agreement with the crystalline size determined by scherer relation from xrd results it seems that the synthesis method in which as synthesized fe3o4 nanoparticles with mean diameter of 37 nm are coated with zro2 shell via sol gel method makes fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles larger than fe3o4 nanoparticles the similarity in the other structural properties aspect ratio compactness and roundness for all three nanoparticles suggests that no specific structural difference existed due to zro2 nanoparticles being deposited on fe3o4 nanoparticles nevertheless based on the difference in the form factor and orientation of fe3o4 nanoparticles compared to others it is expected to create a different morphological change in the membrane structure 3 2 investigating the chemical superficial and structural properties of the synthesized composite and nanocomposite membranes in order to confirm the presence of nanoparticles in the membrane support layer and to identify the functional groups associated with the polymers constituting the membrane structure ftir analysis was conducted on the raw and nanocomposite membrane samples fig 4 in the spectrum related to p a p a n the peaks emerging at the weight of numbers of 2500 2900 cm 1 and 1420 1510 cm 1 represent aliphatic c h groups and cc bond in aromatic groups presence of the peak at the wave number of 2093 cm 1 is due to presence of nitrile group cn in the polyacrylonitrile polymer 41 the peak emerging at the wave number of 1543 cm 1 indicates bending vibration of nh group and stretching vibration of co group in co nh of the polyamide layer 42 in the spectrum of f z 3 p a p a n membrane in addition to the peaks assigned to the membrane layers at the wave numbers of 612 and 785 cm 1 some peaks are observed representing the presence of fe o and zr o functional groups 43 the peak that can be seen at the wave number of 1566 cm 1 also confirms the presence of co where the slight shift of this wave number can be due to presence of nanoparticles 44 in fact the dative bond between zro2 shell and nitrogen atom in amide group nh c o tend to attract the electron between carbon and oxygen so that the co becomes somewhat stronger and higher frequency wave number absorption results at wave number of 1566 cm 1 45 furthermore the wide peak represented at the wave number of 3162 cm 1 is also due to the presence of hydroxyl groups oh resulting from absorption of humidity by the nanoparticles 46 fig 5 demonstrates the ftir spectrum related to p a z r 2 p a n and p a f e 2 p a n membranes in the spectra represented the peaks at the wave number of 2850 2980 and 1400 1450 cm 1 represent aliphatic groups of c h and confirm cc presence two peaks at the wave numbers of 1620 1650 cm 1 confirm the presence of co in the polyamide layer the shift of peak observed can be due to the presence of nanoparticles 44 in fact the loading of zro2 and fe3o4 in pan layer intensifies the presence of oh groups see the peak emerging at 3220 3240 cm 1 and creates the hydrogen bond between oh groups and amide nh groups since o element is more electronegative than n the electron withdrawing effect makes co bond stronger and shifts its location to higher frequency 45 the peaks shown at wave number of 1649 cm 1 and 1625 cm 1 are corresponded to shifted co bond in the p a z r 2 p a n and p a f e 2 p a n membranes spectra respectively the low concentration of core shell nanoparticles in pa layer weakens the probability of hydrogen bonding therefore dative bond in f z 3 p a p a n membrane dominates while for p a z r 2 p a n and p a f e 2 p a n membranes hydrogen bonding occurs since hydrogen bonding is stronger than dative bond the shift in co absorption frequency for p a z r 2 p a n at wave number of 1649 cm 1 and p a f e 2 p a n at wave number of 1625 cm 1 membrane is more than f z 3 p a p a n at wave number of 1566 cm 1 membrane the peak emerging at 2140 2160 cm 1 represents the presence of nitryl group cn 41 also the peak emerging at 3220 3240 cm 1 indicates the presence of superficial humidity resulting from the presence of nanoparticles or the hydrophilic groups of coo h and nh in the polyamide top layer 42 in the spectrum of p a z r 2 p a n membrane the peak emerging at 581 cm 1 is associated with zro3 2 functional group while at the wavenumbers of 682 and 769 cm 1 the presence of one peak suggests the presence of zr o functional group and confirms the presence of zro2 47 the peak at 1625 cm 1 also indicates the zr oh group associated with the nanoparticles 48 the peak at 600 and 651 cm 1 indicates the fe o functional group and thus the presence of iron oxide nanoparticles 46 in order to evaluate the pore size of the pa selective layer mwco analysis was performed the results are presented in fig 6 according to the results presented in fig 6 it is observed that in general adding nanoparticles to the active layer due to the enhanced crosslinking of polyamide chains reduces the mwco of f z i p a p a n membranes compared to the p a p a n membrane the dative bond between a pair of free electrons of nitrogen of amide and free d orbital of zirconium shell of fe3o4 zro2 creates crosslink in polyamide layer see annex of fig 6 indeed decreases pore size and mwco so the mwco for membrane p a p a n and f z 3 p a p a n was measured as about 610 and 380 g mole respectively in addition the presence of zro2 nanoparticles in the support layer due to phase inversion promotion reduces the size of the membrane pores explaining why it can be a more suitable substrate for the formation of polyamide layer in fact bigger pores of substrate would allow the amine solution to diffuse deep into the pores leading to the formation of pa formation inside the pores the smaller pores would limit the diffusion of amine aqueous solution deep into the pores developing thicker pa layer 49 and as evidenced reduces the mwco from 610 g mole for the p a p a n membrane to 541 g mole for the p a z r 2 p a n membrane similarly the presence of fe3o4 nanoparticles in the membrane support layer has helped with reduce the size of the superficial pores in this regard the value of mwco for p a f e 2 p a n membranes was measured as about 542 g mole being around 11 lower as compared to the raw membrane hence the presence of nanoparticles in both membrane layers can regulate the size of membrane pores for f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membranes because of crosslinking enhancement the mwco decreases to 339 and 330 g mole which is lower than p a f e 2 p a n and p a z r 2 p a n membranes then for f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n membranes because of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticle aggregation mwco increases gthe membrane pore size changed between 0 95 nm for the raw membrane to 0 68 nm for f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membrane confirming that the synthesized membrane belongs to nanofiltration category 50 the structure of the membrane was examined in terms of number of pores and extent of tortuosity of pores from the cylindrical state the results for f z i p a p a n f z i p a f e 2 p a n and f z i p a z r 2 p a n membranes are shown in fig 7 based on the data presented in fig 7 the porosity of pan membrane is 18 5 the presence of pa layer causes porosity enhancement for p a p a n membrane in fact the pa layers uptakes some water and increases weight of wet membrane sample so the presence of two layers in the tfc membrane structure increases water uptake and eventually membrane porosity indeed the wet weight ww in eq 1 of tfc membrane is consist of water uptake by substrate pan and pa layer so the porosity of tfc membrane is more than similar substrate for nanocomposite substrates with the presence of fe3o4 and zro2 in pan layer porosity decreases from 18 5 for pan to 16 75 for f e 2 p a n and to and 17 05 for z r 2 p a n which can be due to change in phase inversion process speed by nanoparticle loading 9 based on hagen poiseuille equation 51 porosity and tortuosity influences on the water flow rate since both top and sublayer structure impress the porosity and tortuosity so the reported pore number is related to overall structure of membrane as presented in fig 7 the pore number varies by the presence of pa layer and any change in nanoparticle loading in each layer as seen in the fig 7 the pores formed in the pa layer increases the number of pores from 7 26 109 for pan membrane to 54 16 109 for p a p a n tfc membrane therefore the presence of a polyamide layer slightly affects the porosity while having a severe effect on the number of pores the presence of nanoparticles in pan or pa layer increases number of pores according to the diagram it is observed that for f z i p a p a n membranes with increase in the concentration of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles up to 0 07 wt because of forming nanovoids around the interfaces between fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles and pa matrix 52 pore number and porosity increases the difference between porosity of f z 1 p a p a n and pan membrane can be related to the presence of both pa layer which increase porosity from 18 5 for pan substrate to 24 5 for p a p a n membrane and fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles which increase porosity from 24 5 for p a p a n membrane to 28 4 for f z 1 p a p a n membrane in fact the pa layer uptake some water and depending on its porosity the amount of absorbed water changes a porous pa layer increases the weight of the sample in wet state ww in eq 1 so results in porosity increasing and tortuosity decreasing on the other hand the pa layer with low porosity uptakes less water which caused less porosity and more tortuosity so that with increasing the concentration of nanoparticles because of crosslinking enhancement see fig 6 the size of pores and porosity decreases for f z i p a f e 2 p a n membranes the presence of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles the crosslinking between pa chains see fig 6 provides smaller pores and lower porosity for f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n membrane and then nanoparticle aggregation in the surface layer provides fewer pores with larger size and more porosity for f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n membrane for f z i p a z r 2 p a n membranes with the presence of nanoparticles in the surface layer due to forming nanovoids around the interfaces between fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles and pa matrix 52 for f z 1 p a z r 2 p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n pore number and porosity increases compare to p a z r 2 p a n then for f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n membrane nanoparticle aggregation see fig 6 results in decreasing porosity with the increase in porosity the extent of tortuosity diminishes 53 the results shows that f z i p a z r 2 p a n membranes have the lower membrane tortuosity compared to other nanocomposite membranes reduction of this parameter and approaching 1 the pores find a more vertical structure it is expected that such a structure of pores would have less irreversible fouling potential compared to a similar raw membrane due to less complexity of pores in the cross section to further investigate the structure of composite and nanocomposite membranes sem test was done for observing the cross section of the membrane the results are shown in fig 8 as can be seen in the images with addition of zro2 and fe3o4 nanoparticles to the support layer of the raw membrane and formation of p a z r 2 p a n and p a f e 2 p a n development of large pores along with increased length and width of finger like pores and reduction of the number of pores occurs the presence of fe3o4 nanoparticles in the support layer compared to zro2 develops greater tortuosity in the finger pores where the pores deviate from a cylindrical state the extent of tortuosity of pores shows the number 9 27 for f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n membrane and 15 62 for f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n membrane see fig 7 also by adding fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles to the top layer of the membrane it is observed that the grain numbers of the surface have increased suggesting the presence of nanoparticles in the membrane surface as shown in the sem images left side the thickness of the synthesized membranes has changed within a limited range from 189 9 196 5 μm indeed the measurement of the membranes thickness showed that the maximum difference between the thicknesses of the synthesized membranes is about 6 μm which can be caused by the sem sample preparation procedure and membrane compaction under the operational pressure thus the presence of nanoparticles has no effect on the membranes thickness and it alters the membrane transmission flux only by influencing the membrane porosity the effect of nanoparticles on the thickness of pa layer was investigated by cross sectional sem images see fig 9 as shown in the presented images the thickness of pa layer with the presence of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles slightly increases the thickness of pa layer was measured by imagej software in five different locations and the results were averaged and reported as 0 4 μm for p a p a n and 0 81 μm for f z 3 p a p a n it seems that the presence of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles due to the enhancement of crosslinking between the pa chains helps the growth of pa layer on the other hand the presence of fe3o4 and zro2 nanoparticles in the pan layer makes the pa layer thicker so that the thickness of pa layer determined as 1 41 μm for f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n and 1 61 μm for f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n in fact the low porosity of support layer for f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n membranes prevents diffusing amine solution into substrate so probably the thickness of polyamide layer increases 49 in order to investigate the distribution of nanoparticles in the membrane substrate edx mapping analysis was performed on the f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n membranes see fig 10 as seen in the figure both zro2 and fe3o4 nanoparticles are uniformly distributed in the support layer according to the images it can be observed that zro2 nanoparticles have a relatively uniform distribution near the surface layer because of their hydrophilicity and thus the tendency to move toward the water bath on the other hand for iron oxide nanoparticles due to high surface energy 40 more aggregation is observed at the border of the finger like pores to further inspect the morphology of the surface afm analysis was performed fig 11 displays the afm analysis to investigate the effect of increasing the concentration of nanoparticles on the surface morphology of the membrane based on the 3d images one can understand the increased surface roughness of the membrane in response to elevation of the concentration of nanoparticles across the surface on the other hand addition of nanoparticles to the support layer of membrane reduced the surface roughness of f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n and f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n in comparison with f z 3 p a p a n membrane the peak to valley distance in these membranes has been 417 nm 604 nm and 1 008 μm respectively indeed it seems that the presence of top layer with fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles reduces the membrane surface roughness which is due to settlement of nanoparticles in the deep valleys through the nanoparticles in the near surface layers of the support layer as shown in edx mapping analysis fig 10 upon addition of nanoparticles to the polyamide layer of the surface these nanoparticles deposit on the mouth and wall of superficial pores thereby reducing the total roughness of the membrane clearly the roughness increased further in the presence of iron oxide nanoparticles this can be due to morphology of the iron oxide nanoparticles see sem image fig 3 and their ability in creating larger pores in the membrane support layer providing greater surface roughness for f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n membrane compared to f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n membrane in order to investigate the superficial properties of the membrane including hydrophilicity and superficial charge contact angle analyses and phpzc measurements were done the following diagrams indicated the contact angle of f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n membranes as an accepted hypothesis hydrophilicity means tendency of the surface to wet or forming a thin hydration film over the surface water loving water contact angle lower than 90 degrees is attributed to higher hydrophilicity 32 according to the data represented in fig 12 the presence of zro2 nanoparticles in the membrane support layer is associated with diminished contact angle specifically with 1 5 wt increase in the concentration of zirconia nanoparticles the contact angle drops from 38 for p a p a n membrane to 21 for p a z r 2 p a n membrane the zro2 nanoparticles also tend to be present in the regions close to the membrane surface in the cross section as shown in edx mapping results in fig 10 thus enhancing the pa layer hydrophilicity with addition of zro2 nanoparticles to the support layer and elevation of roughness the extent of available surface of the polyamide layer for contact with the drop increases thereby enhancing the hydrophilicity also the presence of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles in the superficial polyamide layer of the membrane leads to enhanced membrane hydrophilicity per 0 17 wt increase in the concentration of nanoparticles the contact angle falls from 38 for p a p a n to 32 for f z 3 p a p a n membrane and from 32 for p a f e 2 p a n to 23 for f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n and from 21 for p a z r 2 p a n to 18 for f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n based on the data presented in fig 12 with elevation of the iron oxide nanoparticle concentration from 0 to 1 5 wt the contact angle diminishes by 15 7 note that under similar conditions this value is 44 7 for zirconia nanoparticles thus the effect of presence of zirconia nanoparticles on reinforcing surface hydrophilicity is greater than that of iron oxide nanoparticles this observation is associated with the difference in the intrinsic superficial properties of these two nanoparticles in order to determine the superficial charge of the synthesized membranes pzc test was used fig 13 according to the data presented in fig 13 phpzc of fe3o4 zro2 and fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles was 6 7 6 7 and 4 4 respectively the presence of pa layer because of isoelectric point of polyamide groups 54 causes the phpzc of p a p a n to be lower than pan membrane since fe3o4 and zro2 presents in the support layer their blending with pan matrix had little impact on phpzc of the p a p a n membrane phpzc 5 4 where the phpzc of p a f e 2 p a n and p a z r 2 p a n membranes was about 5 2 and 5 02 respectively since the phpzc of the core shell nanoparticles was less than the fe3o4 and zro2 nanoparticles the presence of these nanoparticles across the membrane surface led to diminished pzc of f z 1 p a p a n and f z 2 p a p a n compared to p a p a n membrane though the pzc of f z 3 p a p a n is greater than that of f z 2 p a p a n this can be due to aggregation of the core shell nanoparticles at high concentrations and reduction of their effective surface area 3 3 investigating the filtration behavior of the synthesized composite and nanocomposite membranes the filtration behavior was investigated in the term of flux flux recovery and the extent of cephalexin separation fig 14 demonstrates the effect of concentration and type of nanoparticles added to different layers of the membrane on the water flux of the membranes based on fig 14 and comparing the net water flux passing through different membranes it is observed that with addition of the fe3o4 nanoparticles to the support layer the flux diminishes compared to the p a p a n membrane presence of fe3o4 nanoparticles in the support layer always leads to enhanced hydrophilicity and generally reduction of porosity the low porosity of substrate prevents from diffusing amine solution into substrate so probably the thickness of polyamide layer increases 49 which causes reduction of membrane flux therefore it seems that the reduction of flux of p a f e 2 p a n membrane compared to p a p a n is due to diminished membrane porosity similarly with the presence of zro2 nanoparticles in the support layer the water flux decreases from 53 49 for the raw membrane to 40 62 l m2 h for the p a z r 2 p a n membrane reduction of membrane porosity is the main reason of this behavior and considering the greater hydrophilicity of p a z r 2 p a n membrane compared to p a f e 2 p a n membrane their water flux is also higher further by adding fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles to the membrane surface the surface hydrophilicity and size of pores increase this behavior causes the f z 3 p a p a n membrane to have 84 6 more flux compared to p a p a n membrane addition of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles to the surface of p a f e 2 p a n and p a z r 2 p a n membranes enhances the flux because of increased hydrophilicity the f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membranes have 7 7 and 22 8 greater flux compared p a f e 2 p a n and p a z r 2 p a n overall the results suggest the complementary role of the presence of nanoparticles in the top layer and support layer specifically the presence of core shell nanoparticles on the surface of p a f e 2 p a n and p a z r 2 p a n membranes could compensate the effect of diminished flux caused by reduction of porosity comparison of the water flux of the synthesized membranes with a commercial membrane showed that the membrane f z 2 p a p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n had water fluxes of 60 35 and 49 92 l m2 h while this value was reported as about 42 6 l m2 h for nf270 2450 membrane the effect of adding core shell nanoparticles beyond what can be observed in the water flux behavior manifests itself in the filtration of cephalexin solution fig 15 reveals the effect of elevating the concentration of nanoparticles in the top layer of the membrane on the cephalexin solution flux passing through the membrane as observed in fig 15 for the f z i p a f e 2 p a n membranes with addition of nanoparticles to the membrane surface an ascending trend is observed for the flux resulting from increased hydrophilicity of the membrane specifically for the p a f e 2 p a n f z 1 p a f e 2 p a n f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n membranes the contact angle is 32 29 25 and 23 thus the drug flux for the f z 1 p a f e 2 p a n f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n membranes compared to the p a f e 2 p a n membrane has experienced 19 114 and 165 increase respectively with elevation of the concentration of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles in the top layer of f z i p a z r 2 p a n membrane up to 0 15 wt due to intensification of the hydrophilicity as was observed in fig 12 the water flux increases however with increase in the content of nanoparticles up to the concentration of 0 17 wt due to possible flocculation of nanoparticles and their aggregation blockage of pores and thus dramatic decline in flux occur in order to show the importance of the obtained results the cephalexin flux of nf270 2450 commercial membrane has also been measured and reported in the fig 15 the comparison of the results showed that the f z 2 p a p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membranes have a cephalexin flux of 53 99 and 38 68 l m2 h which is 113 and 52 8 greater than that of the commercial membrane respectively next in order to evaluate the effect of presence of nanoparticles on the secondary flux of membrane the flux recovery was investigated fig 16 reveals the effect of presence of nanoparticles across different layers of the membrane on the extent of flux recovery ratio after cephalexin solution filtration based on the results related to the flux recovery ratio it is observed that in the presence of nanoparticles only in one layer of the membrane due to increased surface roughness according to the results in fig 11 the extent of flux recovery diminishes in this regard the flux recovery of p a f e 2 p a n p a z r 2 p a n and f z 2 p a p a n membranes is 3 3 5 6 and 12 4 less than that of the raw membrane on the other hand with addition of the nanoparticles to both layers of the membrane due to reduction of the surface roughness of the membrane the flux recovery ratio for f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membranes increased by 5 6 and 11 9 compared to p a p a n membrane respectively overall as observed in afm analysis results the membranes with some nanoparticles in their support layer lose parts of their roughness through addition of nanoparticles thus it seems that upon addition of nanoparticles to both layers of the membrane due to reduction in the surface roughness of the membrane the cake formed on the surface can be detached easily thereby increasing the flux recovery the comparison of the flux recovery of the nanocomposite membranes 100 for f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n and 99 11 for f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n membrane with a commercial membrane 96 2 for nf270 2540 indicates the better antifouling behavior of the synthesized membranes in comparison with the commercial sample which is due to the presence of nanoparticles in the membrane structure in order to investigate the effect of presence of nanoparticles across different layers of the membrane on the ability of membranes in separating cephalexin from the synthetic wastewater separation analysis was performed fig 17 demonstrates the results according to the results of the analysis of cephalexin it is observed that the presence of core shell nanoparticles in the surface layer leads to enhance of membrane separation capability in this regard the separation of f z 3 p a p a n membrane is equal to 75 6 which is about 39 more than the measured rejection for p a p a n membrane this behavior is due to lower membrane mwco of f z 3 p a p a n 380 g mole in comparison with p a p a n 610 g mole membrane on the other hand since the phpzc membrane f z 3 p a p a n is less than the feed ph see fig 13 creating electrostatic repulsion is another effective factor in increasing the rejection adding nanoparticles to the membranes support increased the amount of rejection compared to p a p a n membrane indeed the p a z r 2 p a n membrane is able to separate 41 2 of the cephalexin from the effluent due to its lower mwco 541 g mol compared to p a p a n membrane for the p a f e 2 p a n membrane due to the smaller pore size compared to p a p a n membrane it has the ability to separate 41 5 cephalexin which is 5 6 more than p a p a n membrane in the presence of nanoparticles in both layers of the membrane the highest separation was achieved for f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membranes as about 91 and 95 8 respectively as reported in fig 17 the cephalexin rejection of nf270 2540 commercial membrane was evaluated as about 98 9 while f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membrane is able to separate 95 8 cephalexin note that the permeability of nf270 2540 commercial membrane was 10 67 l h m2 bar while that of f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membrane was 12 48 l h m2 bar confirming the important role of nanoparticle loading in both top and support layers of the membrane to emphasize the importance of the site of loading of nanoparticles in the membrane the results of the present research were compared with those of similar studies in this regard the effects of the presence of nanoparticles in the top layer support layer and both layers of the membrane on the superficial structural and filtration properties of the membrane are outlined in table 2 comparison in table 2 shows that for the membranes belonging to category 1 loading the nanoparticles in the top layer of membrane presence of nanoparticles has generally resulted in enhanced water flux as well as increased surface roughness the membranes synthesized in this research had the minimum contact angle and maximum flux along with minor roughness growth and acceptable separation enhancement for the membranes studied in category 2 loading the nanoparticles in the support layer the investigations showed that presence of nanoparticles was associated with dramatic rise in the water flux and minor changes in the separation the membranes synthesized in this research had greater separation enhancement characteristics compared to other studies eventually for the membranes in category 3 loading the nanoparticles in both layers of the membrane the presence of nanoparticles developed minor changes in the extent of separation and was associated with minor growth in the roughness the membranes synthesized in this research showed that presence of nanoparticles in both layers of the membrane is associated with diminished surface roughness increased acceptable extent of separation flux as well as flux recovery 4 conclusion in this research to separate cephalexin from the synthetic effluent thin film composite membranes p a p a n were used to achieve the best membrane function the nanoparticles were used as an enhancer of superficial structural properties as well as filtration behavior in this regard five types of nanocomposite membranes including p a f e j p a n p a z r j p a n f z i p a p a n f z i p a f e j p a n and f z i p a z r j p a n were synthesized and employed in the separation of cephalexin the f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membranes by reducing the mwco membrane pores from 610 g mole for p a p a n membrane to 339 and 330 g mole respectively enhanced the cephalexin rejection from 35 to 91 and 95 8 nevertheless presence of fe and zr nanoparticles in the structure of p a f e 2 p a n and p a z r 2 p a n membranes reduced the water flux by 37 and 24 compared to p a p a n membrane to compensate for the flux reduction f z 2 p a p a n membranes were synthesized due to very high hydrophilicity they showed 12 greater flux and 30 higher cephalexin separation compared to p a p a n membrane presence of core shell nanoparticles across the f z 2 p a p a n membrnae resulted in 58 rise in the roughness and thus only 75 flux recovery to compensate for the increased roughness f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membranes were synthesized which had 16 and 27 less roughness compared to p a p a n membrane and thus 93 and 99 flux recovery with the membranes synthesized in this research were compared with a commercial nanofiltration membrane filmtec nf270 2450 the comparison showed that the synthesized membrane in spite of its similar cephalexin rejection with the commercial one showed more permeability and flux recovery finally f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membrane with permeability of 12 48 l h m2 bar and frr of 99 7 showed a more satisfying performance than nf270 2450 with permeability of 10 67 l h m2 bar and frr of 96 2 declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest 
13794,in this research with the aim of achieving a high flux and rejection of cephalexin antibiotic simultaneously separate modifications were performed on the membrane top layer selective layer and substrate layer support layer fe3o4 fe and zro2 zr nanoparticles were synthesized for modifying the pan support layer while fe3o4 zro2 fz nanoparticles were synthesized for modifying the pa top layer in this regard five types of nanocomposite membranes were synthesized in order to regulate the porosity of the support layer p a f e 2 p a n and p a z r 2 p a n membranes were synthesized which showed more pores number compared to p a p a n membrane in order to enhance the surface hydrophilicity f z 2 p a p a n membrane was synthesized which showed around 16 lower contact angle and 58 greater roughness compared to p a p a n membrane in order to compensate for the roughness developed on the membrane surface concurrent modifications were performed on the top and support layers the f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membranes were synthesized which separated cephalexin by 91 and 95 8 comparison of the performance of the synthesized membrane with that of commercial filmtec nf270 2450 membrane showed that the cephalexin rejection 95 1 and flux recovery 99 1 of f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n are almost the same as cephalexin rejection 98 1 and flux recovery 96 1 of commercial membrane from permeation point of view f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membrane at transmembrane pressure of 4 bar and cross flow velocity of 0 5 m s had a water flux of 49 l m2 h and cephalexin flux of 38 l m2 h while nf270 2450 at the same condition had a water flux of 42 l m2 h and cephalexin flux of 25 l m2 h keywords nanocomposite membrane cephalexin fe3o4 nanoparticle zro2 nanoparticle 1 introduction today presence of pharmaceutical pollutants in the nature has caused different environmental problems and alteration of ecosystems 1 some drugs such as antibiotics are not biodegradable and create drug resistance for this reason their separation is essential 2 in recent years various studies have been performed on the synthesis of nanocomposite membranes in order to separate antibiotics 3 in recent research on achieving a membrane with a satisfactory separation performance either the flux or the rejection membrane has improved 4 6 in the synthesis of nanocomposite membranes various modifiers have been used including carbon nanotubes nanofibers nanosheets and nanoparticles 7 8 metal and metal oxide nanoparticles enjoy greater priority compared to other modifiers thanks to their easy preparation and reasonable price 9 so far various nanoparticles such as sio2 fe3o4 zno zro2 and tio2 have been used to modify the performance of polymer membranes 10 studies suggest that in addition to the type of the nanoparticles used the site of loading of nanoparticles in the membrane matrix also significantly influences the filtration performance and structural properties of the membrane 9 nanoparticles can be combined with the polymer matrix of the support layer or be added as modifiers only to the top layer of the membrane modification of support layer through porosity adjustment and modification of top layer through hydrophilicity enhancement improve membrane permeation the main advantage of nanoparticles loading in support and top layer is uniform dispersion of nanoparticles in support layer and low consumption of nanoparticles in top layer low effectiveness on selectivity is a disadvantage of nanoparticles loading in support layer and low impact on overall structure is the main drawback of nanoparticles loading in top layer considering addition of nanoparticles across the membrane top layer wu et al 11 synthesized s i o 2 p a p s f tfn nf membrane to achieve 1 5 times greater flux and 9 reduction in salt separation khajouei et al 12 also employed in situ synthesis of zero valent iron nanoparticles in superficial polyamide layer of f e 0 p a p s f tfn nf membrane and achieved 1 3 increase in nacl separation as well as 26 growth in the water flux elsewhere by synthesizing r g o t i o 2 p a p e s tfn ro membrane safarpour et al 13 managed to enhance the flux by 49 and increase the salt separation by 2 also regarding loading nanoparticles in the membrane support layer mollahosseini et al 14 synthesized p a t i o 2 p s f tfc nf membrane and observed 277 increase in the water flux compared to the raw membrane note that presence of nanoparticles increased salt rejection by 13 also dong et al 15 by synthesizing p a z e o l i t e p s f tfc nf membrane achieved 195 increase in water flux and decreased nacl and mgso4 separation by 3 and 19 respectively investigations indicated that addition of nanoparticles to the top layer generally leads to enhanced surface hydrophilicity thereby improving the permeation flux however it also leads to increased roughness of the membrane surface on the other hand addition of nanoparticles to the support layer generally causes enhanced hydrophilicity and porosity thereby significantly improving the flux yet it leads to a slight increase or even reduction of membrane separation therefore it seems that presence of nanoparticles in both the top and support layers could develop a synergistic effect in improving the structure superficial properties and filtration behavior of membranes according to the literature so far limited studies have been performed regarding application of nanoparticles in both top and support layers of membrane in which similar nanostructures have been used in the top and support layers in a study chae et al 16 employed graphene oxide nanosheets in both membrane layers g o p a g o p s f tfc ro membrane showed only 7 increase in salt separation while it caused 69 reduction in the membrane flux in another study 17 z e o l i t e p a z e o l i t e p s f tfc ro membrane was synthesized where 68 increase and only 8 growth were observed in flux and salt separation respectively thus considering the different objectives of interest for modifying the top and support layers it seems that use of different nanoparticles with complementary features in both layers of the membrane could be more effective in achieving a desirable membrane structure which provide simultaneous flux and rejection enhancement for antibiotic separation in this research to achieve high flux and rejection of cephalexin from wastewater simultaneously iron oxide nanoparticles were used as a porosity adjuster flux enhancer agent while zirconium oxide nanoparticles were employed as a hydrophilicity enhancer agent in the support layer based on our previous studies using fe3o4 solely in the selective layer increases surface roughness seriously 18 and using zro2 in the surface layer needs modification or functionalization to uniform dispersion 19 on the other hand using composite of fe3o4 and zro2 in core shell format donates special property to the membrane 20 therefore in order to enhance the separation efficiency reduce the surface roughness and mitigate the fouling iron oxide and zirconium nanoparticles were concurrently used in the form of fe3o4 zro2 core shell nanoparticles in the top layer of the membrane finally bilayer nanocomposite membranes f z p a z r p a n and f z p a f e p a n were used to separate cephalexin from a synthetic effluent eventually the performance of the synthesized membranes was compared to that of a commercial filmtec nf270 2450 membrane 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyacrylonitrile pan polymer with a molecular weight of 10 200 g mol was prepared from khoob textile company kashan iran and was used as the base polymer to synthesize the membrane dimethylformamide dmf solvent made by merck germany was employed as the solvent in the stages of membrane synthesis also cephalexin with a molecular weight of 347 39 g mol farabi pharmaceutical co isfahan iran was used as the pollutant in the membrane filtration test in addition trimesoyl chloride tmc and m phenylenediamine mpd made by merck germany were utilized as the constituent monomers of the polyamide layer throughout the interfacial polymerization process normal hexane n hexane made by merck co germany was also applied as the tmc solvent polyethylene glycol peg with molecular weights of 200 400 600 and 800 g mole were prepared from merck company and were used for molecular weight cut off mwco measurement zro2 nanoparticles were synthesized by polymeric sol gel method 21 and fe3o4 nanoparticles were synthesized by microwave assisted method 22 then as prepared fe3o4 nanoparticles were used as a core and a shell of zro2 nanoparticles were coated on the fe3o4 seeds as reported by noormohamadi et al 23 synthesized nanoparticles were employed in the membrane synthesis process 2 2 methods 2 2 1 synthesis of composite and nanocomposite membranes the membranes utilized in this research include composite membranes with pan support layer and polyamide top layer the support layer was synthesized through phase inversion process while the top layer was made during the interfacial polymerization process in order to synthesize the pan support layer first pan polymer was added to dmf under constant stirring and heating at 110 c until achieving the concentration of 15 wt next the prepared polymer solution was cast on a glass surface uniformly by a casting knife in the form of a film with a thickness of 500 μm the polymer film was placed inside a non solvent bath water for 24 h so that through the exchange between the solvent and non solvent the pan membrane would be prepared in order to synthesize the nanocomposite membranes first a specific concentration of zro2 or fe3o4 nanoparticles was added to the dmf solvent next for uniform dispersion of nanoparticles in the solution it was placed inside an ultrasonic bath for 1 h at 70 c next pan was added to the mixture of nanoparticles and dmf in order to synthesize the polyamide top layer through the interfacial polymerization method first an aqueous solution containing 0 075 w v of mpd monomer in water was prepared next the pan support layer was immersed in this solution for 2 min in the next stage a solution of the tmc monomer was prepared in n hexane solvent with a concentration of 0 2 w v next the membrane smeared with amine solution was placed 2 min in tmc solution then withdrawn and further placed inside an oven at 50 c for 6 min in this way the reaction between amine and tmc could be completed and a thin layer of polyamide would form on the pan ultrafiltration membrane surface to synthesize the polyamide nanocomposite layer after dispersion of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles with a specific concentration in water mpd monomer with weight percentage of 0 075 w v was added to the solution and other stages were performed as with the method explained above from among the factors affecting the structure of pan ultrafiltration membrane all characteristics of the membrane synthesis stage of the support layer were considered as constant according to experience of previous research 19 23 while only the effect of type and concentration of nanoparticles was tested on the structure and performance of membrane filtration further in the polyamide nanofiltration layer synthesis stage according to previous studies 18 all of the synthesis variables were considered as constant and only the effect of changes in the concentration of fe3o4 zro2 in the structure of the top layer of the membrane was examined on the morphology and filtration performance of the membrane according to the screening tests the level of variables and the range of their effective changes were determined table 1 presents the membranes synthesized in this research and their synthesis conditions 2 2 2 the methods of characterizing nanoparticles and nanocomposite membranes to detect the crystalline structure of nanoparticles x ray diffraction xrd test was utilized x ray diffractometer advance d8 bruker germany also to calculate the crystalline size of the nanoparticles scherer relation was used 24 in order to observe the cross section of the membrane scanning electron microscopy sem was applied sem images in this research were prepared by sem device quanta feg 450 fei co usa to prepare sem image from nanoparticles the powders were sonicated for 30 min in order to prevent from particle agglomeration then the samples were dried gold sputtered and scanned with electron beam in sem instrument in order to identify the functional groups of nanoparticles and prove their presence in the membrane matrix fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir 6300 jasco co japan was used atomic force microscopy afm was employed to prepare topography images of the membrane surface for this purpose dme dual scope 26 germany was used in the contact mode to measure the porosity a sample of the membrane with an area of 2 cm 2 cm was withdrawn from distilled water bath then the water on its surface was dried slowly and then its wet weight was measured by a balance subsequently the surface of the membrane sample was placed inside a desiccator for 24 h in order to fully dry and the water inside the pores would be removed finally the dry weight of the membrane was also measured and using the following relation the extent of membrane porosity was calculated 25 1 e w w w d ρ w v where ww and wd represent the weight of the sample in wet and dry states g v shows the volume of the sample cm3 and ρw denotes the water density g cm 3 next using the relations known as guerout elford ferry relation the size of the pores was estimated 25 2 r p 2 9 1 75 ε 8 η q l ε a δ p where η denotes the water viscosity 8 9 10 4 pa s l is the film thickness m q denotes the volume flow rate m3 s 1 ε is the membrane porosity a shows the effective surface area m2 and δp is the operational pressure to determine the number of membrane pores the following relation was used 26 3 n ε a π d 2 4 where a represents the area of utilized membrane ε reflects the membrane porosity d is the diameter of membrane pores and n shows the number of membrane pores the extent of tortuosity of membrane pores is also calculated by the following equation 25 4 t o r t u s i t y τ 2 e 2 e this simplified equation is in agreement with the membranes made by phase inversion process 27 29 along with a thin film over the thick support 30 the zero point charge phzpc of the membrane drug sample and nanoparticles was determined by ph drift method 31 to this end 50 mg of each sample nanoparticle drug or membrane has been added to five solutions with different phs 2 4 6 8 and 10 after 24 h the final ph of solutions was measured for this purpose ph meter metrohm switzerland was used the final ph was plotted against initial ph the point at which the plotted curve intersected y x line was considered as point of zero charge 31 in order to determine the membrane contact angle 1 μl of water was dropped gently on the membrane surface by a micropipette then the image of this drop was recorded by nikon d7000 japan the images were analyzed by image processing software and the contact angle between the water drop and membrane surface was measured the contact angle value of θ 90 degrees represents the surface having the affinity toward the water indeed the surface is normally called as hydrophilic 32 2 2 3 filtration tests in cross flow module the experimental setup used in this research consists of a crossflow filtration system plus a module with an effective surface area of 24 32 cm2 the filtration in this system was performed at the pressure of 4 bar crossflow velocity cfv of 0 5 m s and temperature of 25 1 c fig 1 demonstrates the schematic map of this filtration system in this filtration system the container for collecting the permeate sample is placed on the balance connected to the computer the permeate weight was monitored and recorded at different times in order to be used for calculating the flux by relation 5 33 5 j v a t where v represents the volume of water passing through the membrane l a shows the membrane surface area m2 and t denotes the time of using the membrane h to measure the extent of pollutant separation by the membrane a synthetic effluent containing 50 ppm of cephalexin pharmaceutical pollutant mw 347 39 g mol phpzc 4 3 ph 5 3 was prepared and then filtered by the synthesized membranes next the separation percentage was calculated by the following relation 7 6 r c f c p c f 100 where cp shows the pollutant concentration in the flow passed and cf indicates the pollutant concentration in the input feed the pollutant concentration was measured by spectrophotometer jasco v570 at the wavelength of 261 nm in order to determine the membrane pore size molecular weight cut off mwco analysis was performed to perform this analysis solutions of peg 200 peg 400 peg 600 and peg 800 at a concentration of 4 g l were prepared the solutions were filtered by the synthesized membranes and the concentration of permeate and feed were measured using toc analyzer analytic jena multi n c series and co2 ndir detector the molecular weight corresponding to 90 rejection was reported as mwco 34 comparison of the antifouling behavior of the membrane across different states was performed by flux recovery ratio frr feature 33 the antifouling experiment was performed in four stages 35 36 at the first stage the system was operated for filtration of deionized water at cross flow velocity of 0 5 m s for 30 min and flux was recorded as j1 at the second stage filtration of the 50 ppm cephalexin solution was performed for 30 min at cross flow velocity of 0 5 m s at the third stage the membrane was cleaned using deionized water for 30 min at the circulation flow rate of 1 3 m s at the fourth stage the filtration of deionized water was conducted for 30 min at cross flow velocity of 0 5 m s and water flux was recorded as j2 the flux recovery ratio was calculated through relation 7 37 7 f r r j 2 j 1 100 where j1 indicates the initial flux with distilled water feed and j2 denotes the secondary flux with distilled water feed the filtration performance of the synthesized membranes was compared with that of a filmtec commercial membrane nf270 2540 model 3 results and discussion in this research first the utilized nanoparticles were characterized with xrd and sem analyses next the nanocomposite membranes were evaluated in terms of chemical composition through ftir analysis superficial properties by afm contact angle and pzc analyses and structural characteristics by mwco sem edx analysis and pores properties in order to investigate the filtration behavior of synthesized membranes flux rejection and flux recovery ratio analyses were also performed finally the performance of synthesized membranes was compared to commercial filmtec nf270 2450 membrane 3 1 characterization of fe3o4 zro2 zro2 fe3o4 nanoparticles in order to investigate the crystalline structure of nanoparticles xrd spectrum of the nanoparticles samples is shown in fig 2 based on the presented xrd patterns the spectrum related to fe3o4 nanoparticles corresponds with the jcpds cards no 00 001 1111 38 and that of the zro2 nanoparticles fits the jcpds cards no 00 007 0343 39 based on the pattern of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles it is observed that the peak found at 2θ equal to 30 and 58 can correspond with fe3o4 pattern and the peaks indicated at 2θ of 35 and 68 match the zro2 pattern further using the scherer relation the crystalline size for the fe3o4 zro2 and fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles was determined as 26 23 and 53 nm respectively expectedly the crystalline size of the fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles is larger because of having a core shell structure and presence of both fe3o4 and zro2 nanoparticles in its structure to further investigate the morphological characteristics of the nanoparticles sem analysis presented in fig 3 was performed according to the sem images in fig 3 the average sizes of zro2 fe3o4 and fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles are 29 4 37 and 41 nm respectively the size distribution for the zro2 fe3o4 and fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles lies within the ranges of 0 40 nm 10 40 nm and 10 50 nm respectively iron oxide nanoparticles due to their larger size than zirconia oxide nanoparticles have lower surface energy which are less prone to aggregation 40 thus fe3o4 nanoparticles have a more uniform size distribution which indicates greater uniformity moreover the surfactant agent used in synthesis of fe3o4 22 prevents particle aggregation while in the method used for zro2 and fe3o4 zro2 no surfactant has been utilized 21 therefore fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles have more particle aggregation in spite of larger size than fe3o4 it is also observed that for fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles particles larger than 60 nm are also reported which is in agreement with the crystalline size determined by scherer relation from xrd results it seems that the synthesis method in which as synthesized fe3o4 nanoparticles with mean diameter of 37 nm are coated with zro2 shell via sol gel method makes fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles larger than fe3o4 nanoparticles the similarity in the other structural properties aspect ratio compactness and roundness for all three nanoparticles suggests that no specific structural difference existed due to zro2 nanoparticles being deposited on fe3o4 nanoparticles nevertheless based on the difference in the form factor and orientation of fe3o4 nanoparticles compared to others it is expected to create a different morphological change in the membrane structure 3 2 investigating the chemical superficial and structural properties of the synthesized composite and nanocomposite membranes in order to confirm the presence of nanoparticles in the membrane support layer and to identify the functional groups associated with the polymers constituting the membrane structure ftir analysis was conducted on the raw and nanocomposite membrane samples fig 4 in the spectrum related to p a p a n the peaks emerging at the weight of numbers of 2500 2900 cm 1 and 1420 1510 cm 1 represent aliphatic c h groups and cc bond in aromatic groups presence of the peak at the wave number of 2093 cm 1 is due to presence of nitrile group cn in the polyacrylonitrile polymer 41 the peak emerging at the wave number of 1543 cm 1 indicates bending vibration of nh group and stretching vibration of co group in co nh of the polyamide layer 42 in the spectrum of f z 3 p a p a n membrane in addition to the peaks assigned to the membrane layers at the wave numbers of 612 and 785 cm 1 some peaks are observed representing the presence of fe o and zr o functional groups 43 the peak that can be seen at the wave number of 1566 cm 1 also confirms the presence of co where the slight shift of this wave number can be due to presence of nanoparticles 44 in fact the dative bond between zro2 shell and nitrogen atom in amide group nh c o tend to attract the electron between carbon and oxygen so that the co becomes somewhat stronger and higher frequency wave number absorption results at wave number of 1566 cm 1 45 furthermore the wide peak represented at the wave number of 3162 cm 1 is also due to the presence of hydroxyl groups oh resulting from absorption of humidity by the nanoparticles 46 fig 5 demonstrates the ftir spectrum related to p a z r 2 p a n and p a f e 2 p a n membranes in the spectra represented the peaks at the wave number of 2850 2980 and 1400 1450 cm 1 represent aliphatic groups of c h and confirm cc presence two peaks at the wave numbers of 1620 1650 cm 1 confirm the presence of co in the polyamide layer the shift of peak observed can be due to the presence of nanoparticles 44 in fact the loading of zro2 and fe3o4 in pan layer intensifies the presence of oh groups see the peak emerging at 3220 3240 cm 1 and creates the hydrogen bond between oh groups and amide nh groups since o element is more electronegative than n the electron withdrawing effect makes co bond stronger and shifts its location to higher frequency 45 the peaks shown at wave number of 1649 cm 1 and 1625 cm 1 are corresponded to shifted co bond in the p a z r 2 p a n and p a f e 2 p a n membranes spectra respectively the low concentration of core shell nanoparticles in pa layer weakens the probability of hydrogen bonding therefore dative bond in f z 3 p a p a n membrane dominates while for p a z r 2 p a n and p a f e 2 p a n membranes hydrogen bonding occurs since hydrogen bonding is stronger than dative bond the shift in co absorption frequency for p a z r 2 p a n at wave number of 1649 cm 1 and p a f e 2 p a n at wave number of 1625 cm 1 membrane is more than f z 3 p a p a n at wave number of 1566 cm 1 membrane the peak emerging at 2140 2160 cm 1 represents the presence of nitryl group cn 41 also the peak emerging at 3220 3240 cm 1 indicates the presence of superficial humidity resulting from the presence of nanoparticles or the hydrophilic groups of coo h and nh in the polyamide top layer 42 in the spectrum of p a z r 2 p a n membrane the peak emerging at 581 cm 1 is associated with zro3 2 functional group while at the wavenumbers of 682 and 769 cm 1 the presence of one peak suggests the presence of zr o functional group and confirms the presence of zro2 47 the peak at 1625 cm 1 also indicates the zr oh group associated with the nanoparticles 48 the peak at 600 and 651 cm 1 indicates the fe o functional group and thus the presence of iron oxide nanoparticles 46 in order to evaluate the pore size of the pa selective layer mwco analysis was performed the results are presented in fig 6 according to the results presented in fig 6 it is observed that in general adding nanoparticles to the active layer due to the enhanced crosslinking of polyamide chains reduces the mwco of f z i p a p a n membranes compared to the p a p a n membrane the dative bond between a pair of free electrons of nitrogen of amide and free d orbital of zirconium shell of fe3o4 zro2 creates crosslink in polyamide layer see annex of fig 6 indeed decreases pore size and mwco so the mwco for membrane p a p a n and f z 3 p a p a n was measured as about 610 and 380 g mole respectively in addition the presence of zro2 nanoparticles in the support layer due to phase inversion promotion reduces the size of the membrane pores explaining why it can be a more suitable substrate for the formation of polyamide layer in fact bigger pores of substrate would allow the amine solution to diffuse deep into the pores leading to the formation of pa formation inside the pores the smaller pores would limit the diffusion of amine aqueous solution deep into the pores developing thicker pa layer 49 and as evidenced reduces the mwco from 610 g mole for the p a p a n membrane to 541 g mole for the p a z r 2 p a n membrane similarly the presence of fe3o4 nanoparticles in the membrane support layer has helped with reduce the size of the superficial pores in this regard the value of mwco for p a f e 2 p a n membranes was measured as about 542 g mole being around 11 lower as compared to the raw membrane hence the presence of nanoparticles in both membrane layers can regulate the size of membrane pores for f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membranes because of crosslinking enhancement the mwco decreases to 339 and 330 g mole which is lower than p a f e 2 p a n and p a z r 2 p a n membranes then for f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n membranes because of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticle aggregation mwco increases gthe membrane pore size changed between 0 95 nm for the raw membrane to 0 68 nm for f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membrane confirming that the synthesized membrane belongs to nanofiltration category 50 the structure of the membrane was examined in terms of number of pores and extent of tortuosity of pores from the cylindrical state the results for f z i p a p a n f z i p a f e 2 p a n and f z i p a z r 2 p a n membranes are shown in fig 7 based on the data presented in fig 7 the porosity of pan membrane is 18 5 the presence of pa layer causes porosity enhancement for p a p a n membrane in fact the pa layers uptakes some water and increases weight of wet membrane sample so the presence of two layers in the tfc membrane structure increases water uptake and eventually membrane porosity indeed the wet weight ww in eq 1 of tfc membrane is consist of water uptake by substrate pan and pa layer so the porosity of tfc membrane is more than similar substrate for nanocomposite substrates with the presence of fe3o4 and zro2 in pan layer porosity decreases from 18 5 for pan to 16 75 for f e 2 p a n and to and 17 05 for z r 2 p a n which can be due to change in phase inversion process speed by nanoparticle loading 9 based on hagen poiseuille equation 51 porosity and tortuosity influences on the water flow rate since both top and sublayer structure impress the porosity and tortuosity so the reported pore number is related to overall structure of membrane as presented in fig 7 the pore number varies by the presence of pa layer and any change in nanoparticle loading in each layer as seen in the fig 7 the pores formed in the pa layer increases the number of pores from 7 26 109 for pan membrane to 54 16 109 for p a p a n tfc membrane therefore the presence of a polyamide layer slightly affects the porosity while having a severe effect on the number of pores the presence of nanoparticles in pan or pa layer increases number of pores according to the diagram it is observed that for f z i p a p a n membranes with increase in the concentration of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles up to 0 07 wt because of forming nanovoids around the interfaces between fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles and pa matrix 52 pore number and porosity increases the difference between porosity of f z 1 p a p a n and pan membrane can be related to the presence of both pa layer which increase porosity from 18 5 for pan substrate to 24 5 for p a p a n membrane and fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles which increase porosity from 24 5 for p a p a n membrane to 28 4 for f z 1 p a p a n membrane in fact the pa layer uptake some water and depending on its porosity the amount of absorbed water changes a porous pa layer increases the weight of the sample in wet state ww in eq 1 so results in porosity increasing and tortuosity decreasing on the other hand the pa layer with low porosity uptakes less water which caused less porosity and more tortuosity so that with increasing the concentration of nanoparticles because of crosslinking enhancement see fig 6 the size of pores and porosity decreases for f z i p a f e 2 p a n membranes the presence of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles the crosslinking between pa chains see fig 6 provides smaller pores and lower porosity for f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n membrane and then nanoparticle aggregation in the surface layer provides fewer pores with larger size and more porosity for f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n membrane for f z i p a z r 2 p a n membranes with the presence of nanoparticles in the surface layer due to forming nanovoids around the interfaces between fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles and pa matrix 52 for f z 1 p a z r 2 p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n pore number and porosity increases compare to p a z r 2 p a n then for f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n membrane nanoparticle aggregation see fig 6 results in decreasing porosity with the increase in porosity the extent of tortuosity diminishes 53 the results shows that f z i p a z r 2 p a n membranes have the lower membrane tortuosity compared to other nanocomposite membranes reduction of this parameter and approaching 1 the pores find a more vertical structure it is expected that such a structure of pores would have less irreversible fouling potential compared to a similar raw membrane due to less complexity of pores in the cross section to further investigate the structure of composite and nanocomposite membranes sem test was done for observing the cross section of the membrane the results are shown in fig 8 as can be seen in the images with addition of zro2 and fe3o4 nanoparticles to the support layer of the raw membrane and formation of p a z r 2 p a n and p a f e 2 p a n development of large pores along with increased length and width of finger like pores and reduction of the number of pores occurs the presence of fe3o4 nanoparticles in the support layer compared to zro2 develops greater tortuosity in the finger pores where the pores deviate from a cylindrical state the extent of tortuosity of pores shows the number 9 27 for f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n membrane and 15 62 for f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n membrane see fig 7 also by adding fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles to the top layer of the membrane it is observed that the grain numbers of the surface have increased suggesting the presence of nanoparticles in the membrane surface as shown in the sem images left side the thickness of the synthesized membranes has changed within a limited range from 189 9 196 5 μm indeed the measurement of the membranes thickness showed that the maximum difference between the thicknesses of the synthesized membranes is about 6 μm which can be caused by the sem sample preparation procedure and membrane compaction under the operational pressure thus the presence of nanoparticles has no effect on the membranes thickness and it alters the membrane transmission flux only by influencing the membrane porosity the effect of nanoparticles on the thickness of pa layer was investigated by cross sectional sem images see fig 9 as shown in the presented images the thickness of pa layer with the presence of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles slightly increases the thickness of pa layer was measured by imagej software in five different locations and the results were averaged and reported as 0 4 μm for p a p a n and 0 81 μm for f z 3 p a p a n it seems that the presence of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles due to the enhancement of crosslinking between the pa chains helps the growth of pa layer on the other hand the presence of fe3o4 and zro2 nanoparticles in the pan layer makes the pa layer thicker so that the thickness of pa layer determined as 1 41 μm for f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n and 1 61 μm for f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n in fact the low porosity of support layer for f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n membranes prevents diffusing amine solution into substrate so probably the thickness of polyamide layer increases 49 in order to investigate the distribution of nanoparticles in the membrane substrate edx mapping analysis was performed on the f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n membranes see fig 10 as seen in the figure both zro2 and fe3o4 nanoparticles are uniformly distributed in the support layer according to the images it can be observed that zro2 nanoparticles have a relatively uniform distribution near the surface layer because of their hydrophilicity and thus the tendency to move toward the water bath on the other hand for iron oxide nanoparticles due to high surface energy 40 more aggregation is observed at the border of the finger like pores to further inspect the morphology of the surface afm analysis was performed fig 11 displays the afm analysis to investigate the effect of increasing the concentration of nanoparticles on the surface morphology of the membrane based on the 3d images one can understand the increased surface roughness of the membrane in response to elevation of the concentration of nanoparticles across the surface on the other hand addition of nanoparticles to the support layer of membrane reduced the surface roughness of f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n and f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n in comparison with f z 3 p a p a n membrane the peak to valley distance in these membranes has been 417 nm 604 nm and 1 008 μm respectively indeed it seems that the presence of top layer with fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles reduces the membrane surface roughness which is due to settlement of nanoparticles in the deep valleys through the nanoparticles in the near surface layers of the support layer as shown in edx mapping analysis fig 10 upon addition of nanoparticles to the polyamide layer of the surface these nanoparticles deposit on the mouth and wall of superficial pores thereby reducing the total roughness of the membrane clearly the roughness increased further in the presence of iron oxide nanoparticles this can be due to morphology of the iron oxide nanoparticles see sem image fig 3 and their ability in creating larger pores in the membrane support layer providing greater surface roughness for f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n membrane compared to f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n membrane in order to investigate the superficial properties of the membrane including hydrophilicity and superficial charge contact angle analyses and phpzc measurements were done the following diagrams indicated the contact angle of f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n membranes as an accepted hypothesis hydrophilicity means tendency of the surface to wet or forming a thin hydration film over the surface water loving water contact angle lower than 90 degrees is attributed to higher hydrophilicity 32 according to the data represented in fig 12 the presence of zro2 nanoparticles in the membrane support layer is associated with diminished contact angle specifically with 1 5 wt increase in the concentration of zirconia nanoparticles the contact angle drops from 38 for p a p a n membrane to 21 for p a z r 2 p a n membrane the zro2 nanoparticles also tend to be present in the regions close to the membrane surface in the cross section as shown in edx mapping results in fig 10 thus enhancing the pa layer hydrophilicity with addition of zro2 nanoparticles to the support layer and elevation of roughness the extent of available surface of the polyamide layer for contact with the drop increases thereby enhancing the hydrophilicity also the presence of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles in the superficial polyamide layer of the membrane leads to enhanced membrane hydrophilicity per 0 17 wt increase in the concentration of nanoparticles the contact angle falls from 38 for p a p a n to 32 for f z 3 p a p a n membrane and from 32 for p a f e 2 p a n to 23 for f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n and from 21 for p a z r 2 p a n to 18 for f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n based on the data presented in fig 12 with elevation of the iron oxide nanoparticle concentration from 0 to 1 5 wt the contact angle diminishes by 15 7 note that under similar conditions this value is 44 7 for zirconia nanoparticles thus the effect of presence of zirconia nanoparticles on reinforcing surface hydrophilicity is greater than that of iron oxide nanoparticles this observation is associated with the difference in the intrinsic superficial properties of these two nanoparticles in order to determine the superficial charge of the synthesized membranes pzc test was used fig 13 according to the data presented in fig 13 phpzc of fe3o4 zro2 and fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles was 6 7 6 7 and 4 4 respectively the presence of pa layer because of isoelectric point of polyamide groups 54 causes the phpzc of p a p a n to be lower than pan membrane since fe3o4 and zro2 presents in the support layer their blending with pan matrix had little impact on phpzc of the p a p a n membrane phpzc 5 4 where the phpzc of p a f e 2 p a n and p a z r 2 p a n membranes was about 5 2 and 5 02 respectively since the phpzc of the core shell nanoparticles was less than the fe3o4 and zro2 nanoparticles the presence of these nanoparticles across the membrane surface led to diminished pzc of f z 1 p a p a n and f z 2 p a p a n compared to p a p a n membrane though the pzc of f z 3 p a p a n is greater than that of f z 2 p a p a n this can be due to aggregation of the core shell nanoparticles at high concentrations and reduction of their effective surface area 3 3 investigating the filtration behavior of the synthesized composite and nanocomposite membranes the filtration behavior was investigated in the term of flux flux recovery and the extent of cephalexin separation fig 14 demonstrates the effect of concentration and type of nanoparticles added to different layers of the membrane on the water flux of the membranes based on fig 14 and comparing the net water flux passing through different membranes it is observed that with addition of the fe3o4 nanoparticles to the support layer the flux diminishes compared to the p a p a n membrane presence of fe3o4 nanoparticles in the support layer always leads to enhanced hydrophilicity and generally reduction of porosity the low porosity of substrate prevents from diffusing amine solution into substrate so probably the thickness of polyamide layer increases 49 which causes reduction of membrane flux therefore it seems that the reduction of flux of p a f e 2 p a n membrane compared to p a p a n is due to diminished membrane porosity similarly with the presence of zro2 nanoparticles in the support layer the water flux decreases from 53 49 for the raw membrane to 40 62 l m2 h for the p a z r 2 p a n membrane reduction of membrane porosity is the main reason of this behavior and considering the greater hydrophilicity of p a z r 2 p a n membrane compared to p a f e 2 p a n membrane their water flux is also higher further by adding fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles to the membrane surface the surface hydrophilicity and size of pores increase this behavior causes the f z 3 p a p a n membrane to have 84 6 more flux compared to p a p a n membrane addition of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles to the surface of p a f e 2 p a n and p a z r 2 p a n membranes enhances the flux because of increased hydrophilicity the f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membranes have 7 7 and 22 8 greater flux compared p a f e 2 p a n and p a z r 2 p a n overall the results suggest the complementary role of the presence of nanoparticles in the top layer and support layer specifically the presence of core shell nanoparticles on the surface of p a f e 2 p a n and p a z r 2 p a n membranes could compensate the effect of diminished flux caused by reduction of porosity comparison of the water flux of the synthesized membranes with a commercial membrane showed that the membrane f z 2 p a p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n had water fluxes of 60 35 and 49 92 l m2 h while this value was reported as about 42 6 l m2 h for nf270 2450 membrane the effect of adding core shell nanoparticles beyond what can be observed in the water flux behavior manifests itself in the filtration of cephalexin solution fig 15 reveals the effect of elevating the concentration of nanoparticles in the top layer of the membrane on the cephalexin solution flux passing through the membrane as observed in fig 15 for the f z i p a f e 2 p a n membranes with addition of nanoparticles to the membrane surface an ascending trend is observed for the flux resulting from increased hydrophilicity of the membrane specifically for the p a f e 2 p a n f z 1 p a f e 2 p a n f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n membranes the contact angle is 32 29 25 and 23 thus the drug flux for the f z 1 p a f e 2 p a n f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n membranes compared to the p a f e 2 p a n membrane has experienced 19 114 and 165 increase respectively with elevation of the concentration of fe3o4 zro2 nanoparticles in the top layer of f z i p a z r 2 p a n membrane up to 0 15 wt due to intensification of the hydrophilicity as was observed in fig 12 the water flux increases however with increase in the content of nanoparticles up to the concentration of 0 17 wt due to possible flocculation of nanoparticles and their aggregation blockage of pores and thus dramatic decline in flux occur in order to show the importance of the obtained results the cephalexin flux of nf270 2450 commercial membrane has also been measured and reported in the fig 15 the comparison of the results showed that the f z 2 p a p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membranes have a cephalexin flux of 53 99 and 38 68 l m2 h which is 113 and 52 8 greater than that of the commercial membrane respectively next in order to evaluate the effect of presence of nanoparticles on the secondary flux of membrane the flux recovery was investigated fig 16 reveals the effect of presence of nanoparticles across different layers of the membrane on the extent of flux recovery ratio after cephalexin solution filtration based on the results related to the flux recovery ratio it is observed that in the presence of nanoparticles only in one layer of the membrane due to increased surface roughness according to the results in fig 11 the extent of flux recovery diminishes in this regard the flux recovery of p a f e 2 p a n p a z r 2 p a n and f z 2 p a p a n membranes is 3 3 5 6 and 12 4 less than that of the raw membrane on the other hand with addition of the nanoparticles to both layers of the membrane due to reduction of the surface roughness of the membrane the flux recovery ratio for f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membranes increased by 5 6 and 11 9 compared to p a p a n membrane respectively overall as observed in afm analysis results the membranes with some nanoparticles in their support layer lose parts of their roughness through addition of nanoparticles thus it seems that upon addition of nanoparticles to both layers of the membrane due to reduction in the surface roughness of the membrane the cake formed on the surface can be detached easily thereby increasing the flux recovery the comparison of the flux recovery of the nanocomposite membranes 100 for f z 3 p a f e 2 p a n and 99 11 for f z 3 p a z r 2 p a n membrane with a commercial membrane 96 2 for nf270 2540 indicates the better antifouling behavior of the synthesized membranes in comparison with the commercial sample which is due to the presence of nanoparticles in the membrane structure in order to investigate the effect of presence of nanoparticles across different layers of the membrane on the ability of membranes in separating cephalexin from the synthetic wastewater separation analysis was performed fig 17 demonstrates the results according to the results of the analysis of cephalexin it is observed that the presence of core shell nanoparticles in the surface layer leads to enhance of membrane separation capability in this regard the separation of f z 3 p a p a n membrane is equal to 75 6 which is about 39 more than the measured rejection for p a p a n membrane this behavior is due to lower membrane mwco of f z 3 p a p a n 380 g mole in comparison with p a p a n 610 g mole membrane on the other hand since the phpzc membrane f z 3 p a p a n is less than the feed ph see fig 13 creating electrostatic repulsion is another effective factor in increasing the rejection adding nanoparticles to the membranes support increased the amount of rejection compared to p a p a n membrane indeed the p a z r 2 p a n membrane is able to separate 41 2 of the cephalexin from the effluent due to its lower mwco 541 g mol compared to p a p a n membrane for the p a f e 2 p a n membrane due to the smaller pore size compared to p a p a n membrane it has the ability to separate 41 5 cephalexin which is 5 6 more than p a p a n membrane in the presence of nanoparticles in both layers of the membrane the highest separation was achieved for f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membranes as about 91 and 95 8 respectively as reported in fig 17 the cephalexin rejection of nf270 2540 commercial membrane was evaluated as about 98 9 while f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membrane is able to separate 95 8 cephalexin note that the permeability of nf270 2540 commercial membrane was 10 67 l h m2 bar while that of f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membrane was 12 48 l h m2 bar confirming the important role of nanoparticle loading in both top and support layers of the membrane to emphasize the importance of the site of loading of nanoparticles in the membrane the results of the present research were compared with those of similar studies in this regard the effects of the presence of nanoparticles in the top layer support layer and both layers of the membrane on the superficial structural and filtration properties of the membrane are outlined in table 2 comparison in table 2 shows that for the membranes belonging to category 1 loading the nanoparticles in the top layer of membrane presence of nanoparticles has generally resulted in enhanced water flux as well as increased surface roughness the membranes synthesized in this research had the minimum contact angle and maximum flux along with minor roughness growth and acceptable separation enhancement for the membranes studied in category 2 loading the nanoparticles in the support layer the investigations showed that presence of nanoparticles was associated with dramatic rise in the water flux and minor changes in the separation the membranes synthesized in this research had greater separation enhancement characteristics compared to other studies eventually for the membranes in category 3 loading the nanoparticles in both layers of the membrane the presence of nanoparticles developed minor changes in the extent of separation and was associated with minor growth in the roughness the membranes synthesized in this research showed that presence of nanoparticles in both layers of the membrane is associated with diminished surface roughness increased acceptable extent of separation flux as well as flux recovery 4 conclusion in this research to separate cephalexin from the synthetic effluent thin film composite membranes p a p a n were used to achieve the best membrane function the nanoparticles were used as an enhancer of superficial structural properties as well as filtration behavior in this regard five types of nanocomposite membranes including p a f e j p a n p a z r j p a n f z i p a p a n f z i p a f e j p a n and f z i p a z r j p a n were synthesized and employed in the separation of cephalexin the f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membranes by reducing the mwco membrane pores from 610 g mole for p a p a n membrane to 339 and 330 g mole respectively enhanced the cephalexin rejection from 35 to 91 and 95 8 nevertheless presence of fe and zr nanoparticles in the structure of p a f e 2 p a n and p a z r 2 p a n membranes reduced the water flux by 37 and 24 compared to p a p a n membrane to compensate for the flux reduction f z 2 p a p a n membranes were synthesized due to very high hydrophilicity they showed 12 greater flux and 30 higher cephalexin separation compared to p a p a n membrane presence of core shell nanoparticles across the f z 2 p a p a n membrnae resulted in 58 rise in the roughness and thus only 75 flux recovery to compensate for the increased roughness f z 2 p a f e 2 p a n and f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membranes were synthesized which had 16 and 27 less roughness compared to p a p a n membrane and thus 93 and 99 flux recovery with the membranes synthesized in this research were compared with a commercial nanofiltration membrane filmtec nf270 2450 the comparison showed that the synthesized membrane in spite of its similar cephalexin rejection with the commercial one showed more permeability and flux recovery finally f z 2 p a z r 2 p a n membrane with permeability of 12 48 l h m2 bar and frr of 99 7 showed a more satisfying performance than nf270 2450 with permeability of 10 67 l h m2 bar and frr of 96 2 declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest
