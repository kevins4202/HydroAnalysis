study gathered 50 years 1970 2019 of water chemistry data from 12 locations along the adr the variations in discharge and salinity were assessed by a linear regression model and violin plot the salinity discharge relationships were evaluated by a general hyperbolic model and spearman s rank correlation coefficient random forest models were also constructed to identify the predominant drivers of river water salinization finally a conceptual model of river water salinization was constructed new hydrological insights for the region the water salinity s in the upper stream of the adr was 541 635 mg l salinity showed an increasing trend along the river course reaching 751 1560 mg l downstream in the downstream the river salinity before the 1990 s 751 1128 mg l was slightly lower than that after the 1990 s 983 1560 mg l generally water salinity was notably correlated with river discharge q in upstream exhibiting a relationship of s 17 497q 0 62 p 0 05 before the 1990 s interannual variation in river salinity is mainly controlled by secondary salinization and intra annual variation is controlled by river flow from upstream to downstream the controlling salinization process

characterising surface and groundwater quality and it is measured by the total concentration of inorganic ions dissolved in water cañedo argüelles et al 2013 williams and sherwood 1994 freshwater salinization is caused by an increase in ion concentrations in freshwater cañedo argüelles 2020 and it includes primary and secondary salinization primary salinization occurs naturally in water while secondary salinization is mainly caused by anthropogenic activities such as irrigated agriculture cañedo argüelles et al 2013 kitamura et al 2006 in the context of a warming climate and increasing human activities freshwater salinization is an increasing global challenge cañedo argüelles 2021 cunillera montcusí et al 2022 thorslund et al 2021 central asia ca is a region with a semiarid to arid climate karthe et al 2015 that is facing increasingly severe water scarcity and large scale water pollution from agricultural and mining activities hao et al 2022 liu et al 2021 freshwater salinization is very severe in ca as well as in most arid and semiarid regions of the world cañedo argüelles 2020 cunillera montcusí et al 2022 in such regions secondary salinization of surface groundwater systems is most likely amplified by climate change cunillera montcusí et al 2022 the decrease in available freshwater and deterioration in water quality associated with freshwater salinization has posed a great threat to aquatic and riparian ecosystems human health and socioeconomic development in ca karthe et al 2017 wæhler and dietrichs 2017 the adr one of the major central asian rivers originates from the tian shan and pamir alai mountains historical observations showed that the annual upstream river flow in the adr experienced a decreasing trend during 1951 2007 in response to the warming climate wang et al 2016 recently several studies have analysed the variation in water salinity in the adr and its relationship with flow during different periods for example crosa et al 2006 analysed the spatial and seasonal variations in salinity in the adr during the 1990 1997 period karimov et al 2019 evaluated the salinization dynamics upstream of the adr in 2005 2014 using the annual average salinity lobanova and didovets 2019 analysed the change trends of mean annual and monthly salinity over 1990 2015 these studies found that decreased river flow has led to increasing freshwater salinization especially in the downstream areas of the adr ahrorov et al 2012 gaybullaev et al 2012 in particular notable salinity increases in the lower adr were observed since the 1960 s when irrigation and agricultural activities intensified crosa et al 2006 karimov et al 2019 lobanova and didovets 2019 rakhmatullaev et al 2010 yapiyev et al 2021 in general current research highlights the increasing salinization in the adr and its harmful effects nevertheless long term changes and seasonal variations in river water salinization in relation to river flow changes and anthropogenic activities are not fully understood a few studies have focused on the spatial patterns of salinization and the identification of predominant drivers of river water salinity from the perspectives of primary and secondary salinization these gaps likely pose great challenges to sustainable development in the adr partly due to the lack of long term observational data therefore this study collected monthly and annual data on river discharge and water salinity at 12 hydrological stations in the adr over the past 50 years 1970 2019 the objectives of this study are to 1 identify the intra and interannual changes in river salinity and discharge over the past five decades 2 examine the relationships between river salinity and discharge for different periods and 3 identify the possible drivers of river water salinization in the adr basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the adr basin is characterised by a dry continental climate that is severely cold in the winter and extremely hot in the summer huang et al 2021a 2021b under a warming climate this region experienced an upward trend of 0 30 c decade in temperature which is much higher than the global warming rate 0 175 c decade during 1960 2017 hu et al 2021 precipitation varies widely from upstream to downstream the mean annual precipitation was greater than 1000 mm in the upstream alpine area and approximately 100 300 mm in the downstream desert steppe area especially in khorezm where it was only 95 mm lobanova and didovets 2019 wang et al 2016 during 1960 2017 an upward trend in precipitation of 3 mm decade was observed in the adr basin while a downward trend of 10 mm decade was observed in the southwestern part of the basin hu et al 2021 the adr begins following the conjunction of the vahsh and pianj rivers in tajikistan and has a total length of 1415 km excluding the pianj river lobanova and didovets 2019 fig 1 the main right bank tributaries of the adr are the vahsh river kafirnigan river surkhandarya river sherabad river and zeravshan river which do not reach the adr the main left bank tributaries are the pianj river and kunduz river the mean annual discharge sum in the adr was approximately 79 km3 for 2000 2018 oecd 2020 due to a typical continental climate april september runoff accounted for 77 80 of the total annual runoff while december february runoff accounted for only 10 13 agal tseva et al 2011 the runoff of adr declined significantly during 1960 2017 e g 0 52 mm a and 0 97 mm a at the termez and kiziljar stations respectively due to climate change and increasing human activities such as water withdrawals for agricultural irrigation hu et al 2021 recently climate changes and increasing population density together with intensified agricultural activities have exacerbated drought in the adr and significantly changed the quantity salinity and quality of river water posing a threat to human and agricultural water use 2 2 data the monthly data of river discharge and river water chemistry in 1970 2002 were taken from the archives of the centre of hydrometeorological service at the cabinet of ministers of the republic of uzbekistan and the central asian scientific research institute for irrigation respectively the river water salinity was calculated as the sum of the ionic composition of the major cations and anions in milligrams per litre the mean annual salinization data from 2000 to 2015 were acquired from lobanova and didovets 2019 the irrigated area water withdrawal drainage flow to the river and salinity of drainage flow in the adr middle and downstream reaches were taken from the water quality dataset of the cawater info website sic icwc 2021 the population density was downloaded from the world bank open dataset world bank group 2021 the boundary of the adr basin is downloaded from ran et al 2020 the aral sea boundary is downloaded from sun 2019 2 3 methods 2 3 1 methods for data selection monthly water chemistry data were checked using the pauta criterion 3σ and the observed outliers i e data error exceeding 3σ were discarded the pauta criterion can detect outliers under a confidence probability of 99 7 li et al 2016 furthermore data for river discharge and water chemistry that did not appear in pairs were removed the selected data were used to study the spatial intra and interannual variations in river discharge and water salinity the steps in the pauta criterion are described as follows yao et al 2007 1 the average of the n sample data for the discrete probability distribution samples 1 x 1 n i 1 n x i 2 calculating the residual error of each sample 2 v i x i x 3 calculating the standard deviation 3 σ i 1 n v i 2 n 1 4 identifying the sample data that v i 3 σ where n is the sample number x i is the value of the i th sample x is the average value of the n sample data v i is the residual error and σ is the standard deviation 2 3 2 statistical analysis a violin plot which is a hybrid form of a box plot and a density trace was applied to visualise and analyse summary statistics and density shapes for data exploration hintze and nelson 1998 spearman s rank correlation coefficient is a classical method to analyse the correlation between two variables hao et al 2022 it does not require the frequency distribution of the variables and can identify nonlinear relationships very well hauke and kossowski 2011 spearman 1904 spearman s rank correlation coefficient was used to explore the relationships between river discharge and salinity 2 3 3 general hyperbolic model the river discharge and salinity relationships are widely described by a general hyperbolic model which can be written as follows meybeck et al 1989 4 m i a q i b where m i is the instantaneous river water salinization q i is the instantaneous river discharge a is the river discharge coefficient representing the basal flow and b is the power of the river discharge and indicates the dilution effect crosa et al 2006 for a given discharge the higher the values of the two constant parameters a and b are the higher the river salinization is previously the general hyperbolic model was used to investigate the relationships between salinization and discharge in the adr crosa et al 2006 2 3 4 random forest model random forest rf is a machine learning algorithm that is increasingly being used to identify the key drivers of environmental and freshwater salinization issues thorslund et al 2021 in this study rf models were used to analyse the effects of hydrometeorological and anthropogenic factors including runoff r agricultural water withdrawal aww irrigation return flow irf water salinity of return flow ws rf irrigation areas ia average nitrogen fertiliser use n average phosphate fertiliser use p population density pop d precipitation pre temperature tmp and potential evapotranspiration pet on water salinity table 1 we performed rf models at stations m2 upstream and midstream boundary m4 midstream and downstream boundary and m6 downstream and delta zone boundary using the annual data from 1991 to 2010 the variables were standardised and checked for collinearity before performing the random forest model feld et al 2016 the collinearity was checked by the variance inflation factor vif according to the vif for sites m4 and m6 indicators of irrigation areas average phosphate fertiliser use and population density were removed finally at the three sites m2 m4 m6 the vif of all variables used in the random forest model was less than 10 3 results and discussion 3 1 interannual changes in river discharge and salinity as shown in fig 2 the river discharge of the adr generally displayed a notable decreasing trend throughout the past five decades especially downstream for example the mean river discharge at hydrological station m4 decreased from 962 m3 s in the 1970 s to 307 m3 s in the 2000 s hydrological measurements at hydrological station m6 showed that the mean river discharge decreased from 481 m3 s in the 1970 s to 62 m3 s in the 2000 s the mean river discharge at hydrological station m7 decreased even faster from 595 m3 s in the 1970 s to 28 m3 s in the 2000 s however the annual river discharge in the upstream showed less temporal variation than the river discharge in the downstream as evidenced by the hydrological monitoring at station m1 surkhandarya river the mean river discharge decreased slightly from 220 m3 s in the 1970 s to 204 m3 s in the 2000 s in addition evidence of decreased discharge was found along the river course of the adr from station m4 1026 m3 s to station m6 272 m3 s where it decreased by 74 over a longitudinal distance of 228 km the mean river water salinity observed at eight hydrological stations was less than 1000 mg l in the 1970 s however a notable increasing trend was exhibited in river water salinity from the 1970 s to the 1980 s in the 1980 s the average river water salinities at three sites namely m5 1038 mg l m6 1110 mg l and m7 1128 mg l were greater than 1000 mg l the river water salinity at site m4 922 mg l in the 1980 s was close to 1000 mg l then river water salinity remained relatively constant from the 1980 s to the 1990 s for example the mean river water salinities were 1007 mg l 1018 mg l and 983 mg l at the m5 m6 and m7 sites respectively which were slightly different from those in the 1980 s furthermore a notable increasing trend of river salinity appeared again at stations m6 m7 and m4 from the 1990 s to the 2000 s in the 2000 s 2000 2002 the mean river salinities at sites m6 1211 mg l m7 1560 mg l and m4 1009 mg l were all higher than 1000 mg l linear models between salinity and distance during the periods of 1970 1979 1980 1989 1990 1999 2000 2002 and 1970 2002 were developed fig 3 spatially a clear increasing trend pattern in river salinity was detected from upstream to downstream in the adr basin fig 2a which was indicated by the high correlation coefficient and r squared value fig 3 brackish water salinity higher than 1000 mg l mainly occurred downstream in contrast the water salinity at site m1 upstream was the lowest among the eight monitoring sites with values below 1000 mg l throughout the 1970 2000 s the annual river water salinities for 2000 2015 at the survey sites are shown in fig 4 compared with the other sites the highest river water salinity during the period of 2000 2010 was observed at site m6 notably water salinity at site m6 experienced significant decreases with a slope of 75 84 mg l per year from 2000 to 2010 in particular the annual river salinity at the m6 site declined to less than 1000 mg l after 2008 observations at site s2 kafirnigan river also showed negative trends with a slope of 19 49 mg l per year in annual river water salinity suggesting that river salinity declined from 2000 to 2015 in contrast river salinities at sites m2 and s1 showed increasing trends with slopes of 16 22 mg l per year and 22 26 mg l per year respectively the river salinities at sites m2 and s1 nearly reached 1000 mg l in 2015 river salinities at sites m3 m4 s4 located between m2 and m3 and s3 surkhandarya river did not show notable changing trends during the 2000 2015 period generally water salinities at sites m3 m4 s4 and s3 were less than 1000 mg l which meets the quality requirements for drinking and irrigation in particular the mean annual salinities at the s3 site were less than 600 mg l during the 2000 2015 period 3 2 seasonal variations in discharge and salinity the statistics for monthly river discharge and salinity at the hydrological stations of the adr are shown in tables s5 and s6 and the seasonal trends for river discharge and salinity are shown in table s7 as shown in fig 5 river discharge experienced notable seasonal variations the maximum monthly river discharge usually occurred during summer june august at all stations river discharge at four hydrological stations m1 m4 m5 and m6 had minimum values during winter december february the density shapes in the violin plots show that the distribution of monthly salinity is more uniform and symmetrical than that of river discharge especially at hydrological stations m6 and m7 fig 2 generally the highest monthly river salinity occurred in april except for stations m1 february and m4 march the lowest river salinity usually occurred in july september except for station m1 november spatially a clear pattern of increasing river salinization was detected from upstream to downstream in the adr basin the highest river salinity was observed at station m7 with a value of 3795 mg l the mean monthly water salinity increased by 80 during 1970 2002 for 1174 km from station m1 595 mg l to station m7 1073 mg l in terms of variations in salinity during the year the highest monthly average salinity values at the considered stations along the river were within the ranges of 596 1378 mg l m1 980 1737 mg l m4 911 2105 mg l m5 982 2574 mg l m6 942 3796 mg l m7 and 724 1371 mg l m8 as shown in fig 5 monthly river salinity exhibited a negative correlation with monthly river discharge at all stations however the negative relationship between river discharge and river salinity became less obvious along the river the most obvious negative relationship between river salinity and discharge was observed at hydrological station m1 upstream fig 5a while such a negative relationship was nonsignificant at station m8 downstream fig 5f along the river course from station m4 the boundary between the middle stream and downstream areas to m7 downstream the distance between sites m4 and m7 is 356 km the highest value of river salinity approximately doubled however the discharge was reduced by less than half 3 3 spatial patterns of river salinity discharge relationships river salinity discharge relationships and their correlation coefficients are shown in fig 6 and table s8 and residual plots were used to verify the reliability of the results the results show that river salinity discharge relationships displayed notable spatial longitudinal variations in the adr basin at hydrological stations m4 and m6 coefficient b in the general hyperbolic model eq 4 were higher than those at the other stations indicating that the flow dilution effect had predominant influences on river salinities at these two stations during both the 1970 1980 s and 1990 2000 s based on the comparisons of parameters a and b in the general hyperbolic model eq 4 among all stations we found that baseflow effects outweighed dilution effects at stations m1 m2 and m3 with larger values of a however dilution effects outweighed baseflow effects on the river salinities with higher values of b were observed at stations m4 m6 m7 and m8 additionally baseflow and dilution had comparable effects on river salinities at station m5 compared with the 1970 1980 s period reduced baseflow effects on river water salinities can be found during the 1990 2000 s at stations m1 and m4 however the baseflow effects on river water salinities exhibited increasing trends from the 1970 1980 s to 1990 2000 s at stations m5 m6 and m7 as shown in fig 7 in general the correlation coefficients between river salinity and river discharge during the growing season high flow are greater than those during the nongrowing season low flow it can be concluded that although the increased river salinities were mainly driven by human activities in the past decades the seasonal variations in river water salinity are controlled by the dilution effect of the river flow the correlation coefficients between river salinity and discharge of annual data in the 1970 1980 s are higher than those in the 1990 2000 s at stations m1 and m4 and the opposite cases are observed at stations m5 and m6 3 4 driving forces and conceptual model of river water salinization 3 4 1 river water salinization driven by natural processes and human activities as noted by cañedo argüelles et al 2013 and thorslund et al 2021 freshwater salinization is driven by both natural e g evaporation processes and anthropogenic e g agricultural activities factors our results fig 8 showed that the average nitrogen fertiliser use n agricultural water withdrawal aww and water salinity of return flow ws rf are the most influential factors in river salinity at stations m2 m4 and m6 respectively our analysis confirmed that anthropogenic factors associated with agricultural activities are predominant drivers of river water salinization in the adr which is consistent with previous studies in central asian rivers crosa et al 2006 karimov et al 2019 lobanova and didovets 2019 rakhmatullaev et al 2010 yapiyev et al 2021 globally as indicated by gibbs 1970 river water chemistry is generally controlled by atmospheric precipitation rock dominance and the evaporation crystallisation process for rivers in central asian arid regions ion concentrations in river water are increasing due to intensified evaporation from upstream to downstream the evaporation in the northwestern middle and downstream is higher than that in the southeastern upstream of the adr basin therefore this may be one of the reasons why the river salinity in the middle and downstream is greater than that in the upstream on the other hand river salinity can be reduced by dilution during periods of rainfall cañedo argüelles 2020 thorslund et al 2021 generally salinity is low where precipitation is greater spatially precipitation was higher in the southeastern adr basin than in the northwestern part temporally the annual precipitation exhibited an increasing trend 3 mm decade during 1960 2017 except for the southwestern part of the basin approximately 10 mm decade hu et al 2021 the effect of precipitation dilution on freshwater salinization is opposite to that of the enrichment of river water salinity by evaporation however the river water salinity in the adr did not decrease during the 1970 1990 s therefore increased precipitation failed to reduce the water salinity due to other factors e g water withdrawal for irrigation fertiliser usage and return flow a recent study has shown that human activities may be an important cause of temporal dynamics in river salinity moyano salcedo et al 2022 in the adr basin river salinization can also be caused by enhanced human activities which is evidenced by the fact that the population density increased approximately threefold in riverine countries throughout 1960 2020 fig s3 there have been no considerable increasing trends in urban and cropland areas during the past 50 years fig s4 shi et al 2021 yapiyev et al 2021 nevertheless agricultural activity intensified after the 1970 1980 s in the adr basin due to increased irrigation for water intensive crops elevated usage of pesticides and fertilisers and degraded irrigation and drainage canals shi et al 2021 törnqvist et al 2011 yapiyev et al 2021 our analysis showed that the irrigated areas in the downstream of the adr basin remained almost constant from 1991 to 2010 however the irrigated areas exhibited a slightly increasing trend in the middle stream fig s5 water withdrawal showed a slight decreasing trend in the middle and downstream areas during the period from 1991 to 2010 fig s5 moreover the river water salinity showed negative trends from 2000 to 2015 at most sites fig 4 irrigation and drainage activities in the adr basin are the main processes governing the spatial temporal pattern of salt content in the river together the volume and salinity of return flow likely shape the spatial and temporal patterns of freshwater salinization which is indicated by the consistent trends in the river water salinity of the considered stations during 1990 2010 in particular the return flow with a high salt load from drainage systems into the river is the major factor that shapes the salt dynamics in general river runoff in the adr has experienced a notable declining trend over the past half century and is expected to decrease by 10 20 by the end of the 21st century due to the influences of climate change and human activities in the adr basin hu et al 2021 white et al 2014 freshwater salinization has been exacerbated by decreased water volume and weakened dilution in the middle and downstream reaches of the adr due to increased water demands and withdrawals by agricultural and domestic users cañedo argüelles 2020 as noted by niedrist et al 2021 water resource extraction or agriculture are the main drivers of secondary salinization in arid and semiarid regions similarly secondary salinization is likely the main process of water salinization in the adr however in terms of the seasonal changes in salinity the main controlling factor of intra annual variation in salinity in the adr is flow salinity does not increase in april september which is the growing season when agricultural activities intensify e g increased pesticide use fertiliser use and irrigation water return flow in contrast water salinity decreases in the basin due to the high flows even in the lower reaches therefore in the adr intra annual variation in salinity is dominated by natural factors and simultaneously it is regulated by human activity timpano et al 2018 3 4 2 conceptual model of river water salinization there is significant spatial heterogeneity in freshwater salinization and salinity discharge relationships and their drivers in the adr basin under the combined effect of human activities and climate change fig 9 shows the processes and drivers of river water salinization in the adr basin in the upstream where river flows are high and the intensity of human activity is low the salinity of the water is mainly controlled by primary salinization e g snow melting precipitation although hydroelectric plant operations and mining can regulate water salinity they do not lead to a significant deterioration of salinization in the middle stream human activity is gradually intensifying and the salinity of the water is influenced by a combination of natural processes e g increased temperature and evaporation and human activity e g industrial and agricultural activities in the downstream and delta areas high intensity agricultural activities e g pesticides fertilisers irrigation water return flow control the process of water salinization in addition salinity accumulation also contributes to increasing salinization due to the flow concentration process this conceptual model can be applied to analyse the freshwater salinization processes in agriculturally dominated inland rivers recharged by snowmelt in semiarid to arid areas 3 5 uncertainties and limitations in this study we attempted to analyse the long term change patterns of salinity and flow in the adr based on a large amount of observational monthly data for water salinity and discharge however the data series were not consistent and varied year by year table s2 although we used a time step of a decade to reduce the potential random errors these uncertainties could not be eliminated entirely in addition data from different seasons may introduce uncertainty in the interpretation of the results estimated general hyperbolic models provided us with general knowledge about the spatiotemporal patterns of salinity discharge relationships in the adr although river discharge is the main driving factor for seasonal variation in river water salinity in the adr freshwater salinization is certainly influenced by other natural and human factors crosa et al 2006 in this study the potential drivers of river water salinity such as soil salinity and irrigation schemes were not considered in the rf models due to the lack of such data 4 conclusions in this study the spatial and temporal patterns of streamflow and river salinity in the adr basin during the past five decades were analysed comprehensively the results revealed that river salinity generally increased along the river course and the river water salinity exceeded the safe drinking and irrigation standard 1000 mg l in the middle and downstream areas especially in the downstream area temporally during the 1970 1990 s the river water salinity experienced a notable increasing trend however it gradually decreased after 2000 apart from natural salinization processes the increasing intensity of human activities including water withdrawal for crop irrigation and high salinity drainage and wastewater flows into the river is the predominant driver of river water salinization although limited success was achieved in controlling river water salinity during the 21st century more efforts are needed to mitigate challenges related to freshwater salinization and to realise regional sdgs recognising that freshwater salinization from agricultural activities is a growing problem thorslund et al 2021 a detailed analysis of freshwater salinization at subbasin or irrigated agricultural region scales is needed equally important such analyses require detailed irrigation data such as irrigation schemes and the location and quantities of return flow from main drains in terms of research methodology water quality modelling approaches can be performed to understand the salt dynamics in river reaches and bayesian model approaches can be applied to quantify the contributions of freshwater salinization drivers huang et al 2021a 2021b moreover the breakpoints in both trend and seasonal components can be detected by the break for the additive season and trend bfast method based on long term consecutive data verbesselt et al 2010 in addition more efforts are needed to analyse the interactions between freshwater salinization and the sdgs and to mitigate the potential trade offs among sdgs using the nexus approach flörke et al 2019 liu et al 2018 credit authorship contribution statement lingang hao conceptualization data curation

asian rivers originates from the tian shan and pamir alai mountains historical observations showed that the annual upstream river flow in the adr experienced a decreasing trend during 1951 2007 in response to the warming climate wang et al 2016 recently several studies have analysed the variation in water salinity in the adr and its relationship with flow during different periods for example crosa et al 2006 analysed the spatial and seasonal variations in salinity in the adr during the 1990 1997 period karimov et al 2019 evaluated the salinization dynamics upstream of the adr in 2005 2014 using the annual average salinity lobanova and didovets 2019 analysed the change trends of mean annual and monthly salinity over 1990 2015 these studies found that decreased river flow has led to increasing freshwater salinization especially in the downstream areas of the adr ahrorov et al 2012 gaybullaev et al 2012 in particular notable salinity increases in the lower adr were observed since the 1960 s when irrigation and agricultural activities intensified crosa et al 2006 karimov et al 2019 lobanova and didovets 2019 rakhmatullaev et al 2010 yapiyev et al 2021 in general current research highlights the increasing salinization in the adr and its harmful effects nevertheless long term changes and seasonal variations in river water salinization in relation to river flow changes and anthropogenic activities are not fully understood a few studies have focused on the spatial patterns of salinization and the identification of predominant drivers of river water salinity from the perspectives of primary and secondary salinization these gaps likely pose great challenges to sustainable development in the adr partly due to the lack of long term observational data therefore this study collected monthly and annual data on river discharge and water salinity at 12 hydrological stations in the adr over the past 50 years 1970 2019 the objectives of this study are to 1 identify the intra and interannual changes in river salinity and discharge over the past five decades 2 examine the relationships between river salinity and discharge for different periods and 3 identify the possible drivers of river water salinization in the adr basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the adr basin is characterised by a dry continental climate that is severely cold in the winter and extremely hot in the summer huang et al 2021a 2021b under a warming climate this region experienced an upward trend of 0 30 c decade in temperature which is much higher than the global warming rate 0 175 c decade during 1960 2017 hu et al 2021 precipitation varies widely from upstream to downstream the mean annual precipitation was greater than 1000 mm in the upstream alpine area and approximately 100 300 mm in the downstream desert steppe area especially in khorezm where it was only 95 mm lobanova and didovets 2019 wang et al 2016 during 1960 2017 an upward trend in precipitation of 3 mm decade was observed in the adr basin while a downward trend of 10 mm decade was observed in the southwestern part of the basin hu et al 2021 the adr begins following the conjunction of the vahsh and pianj rivers in tajikistan and has a total length of 1415 km excluding the pianj river lobanova and didovets 2019 fig 1 the main right bank tributaries of the adr are the vahsh river kafirnigan river surkhandarya river sherabad river and zeravshan river which do not reach the adr the main left bank tributaries are the pianj river and kunduz river the mean annual discharge sum in the adr was approximately 79 km3 for 2000 2018 oecd 2020 due to a typical continental climate april september runoff accounted for 77 80 of the total annual runoff while december february runoff accounted for only 10 13 agal tseva et al 2011 the runoff of adr declined significantly during 1960 2017 e g 0 52 mm a and 0 97 mm a at the termez and kiziljar stations respectively due to climate change and increasing human activities such as water withdrawals for agricultural irrigation hu et al 2021 recently climate changes and increasing population density together with intensified agricultural activities have exacerbated drought in the adr and significantly changed the quantity salinity and quality of river water posing a threat to human and agricultural water use 2 2 data the monthly data of river discharge and river water chemistry in 1970 2002 were taken from the archives of the centre of hydrometeorological service at the cabinet of ministers of the republic of uzbekistan and the central asian scientific research institute for irrigation respectively the river water salinity was calculated as the sum of the ionic composition of the major cations and anions in milligrams per litre the mean annual salinization data from 2000 to 2015 were acquired from lobanova and didovets 2019 the irrigated area water withdrawal drainage flow to the river and salinity of drainage flow in the adr middle and downstream reaches were taken from the water quality dataset of the cawater info website sic icwc 2021 the population density was downloaded from the world bank open dataset world bank group 2021 the boundary of the adr basin is downloaded from ran et al 2020 the aral sea boundary is downloaded from sun 2019 2 3 methods 2 3 1 methods for data selection monthly water chemistry data were checked using the pauta criterion 3σ and the observed outliers i e data error exceeding 3σ were discarded the pauta criterion can detect outliers under a confidence probability of 99 7 li et al 2016 furthermore data for river discharge and water chemistry that did not appear in pairs were removed the selected data were used to study the spatial intra and interannual variations in river discharge and water salinity the steps in the pauta criterion are described as follows yao et al 2007 1 the average of the n sample data for the discrete probability distribution samples 1 x 1 n i 1 n x i 2 calculating the residual error of each sample 2 v i x i x 3 calculating the standard deviation 3 σ i 1 n v i 2 n 1 4 identifying the sample data that v i 3 σ where n is the sample number x i is the value of the i th sample x is the average value of the n sample data v i is the residual error and σ is the standard deviation 2 3 2 statistical analysis a violin plot which is a hybrid form of a box plot and a density trace was applied to visualise and analyse summary statistics and density shapes for data exploration hintze and nelson 1998 spearman s rank correlation coefficient is a classical method to analyse the correlation between two variables hao et al 2022 it does not require the frequency distribution of the variables and can identify nonlinear relationships very well hauke and kossowski 2011 spearman 1904 spearman s rank correlation coefficient was used to explore the relationships between river discharge and salinity 2 3 3 general hyperbolic model the river discharge and salinity relationships are widely described by a general hyperbolic model which can be written as follows meybeck et al 1989 4 m i a q i b where m i is the instantaneous river water salinization q i is the instantaneous river discharge a is the river discharge coefficient representing the basal flow and b is the power of the river discharge and indicates the dilution effect crosa et al 2006 for a given discharge the higher the values of the two constant parameters a and b are the higher the river salinization is previously the general hyperbolic model was used to investigate the relationships between salinization and discharge in the adr crosa et al 2006 2 3 4 random forest model random forest rf is a machine learning algorithm that is increasingly being used to identify the key drivers of environmental and freshwater salinization issues thorslund et al 2021 in this study rf models were used to analyse the effects of hydrometeorological and anthropogenic factors including runoff r agricultural water withdrawal aww irrigation return flow irf water salinity of return flow ws rf irrigation areas ia average nitrogen fertiliser use n average phosphate fertiliser use p population density pop d precipitation pre temperature tmp and potential evapotranspiration pet on water salinity table 1 we performed rf models at stations m2 upstream and midstream boundary m4 midstream and downstream boundary and m6 downstream and delta zone boundary using the annual data from 1991 to 2010 the variables were standardised and checked for collinearity before performing the random forest model feld et al 2016 the collinearity was checked by the variance inflation factor vif according to the vif for sites m4 and m6 indicators of irrigation areas average phosphate fertiliser use and population density were removed finally at the three sites m2 m4 m6 the vif of all variables used in the random forest model was less than 10 3 results and discussion 3 1 interannual changes in river discharge and salinity as shown in fig 2 the river discharge of the adr generally displayed a notable decreasing trend throughout the past five decades especially downstream for example the mean river discharge at hydrological station m4 decreased from 962 m3 s in the 1970 s to 307 m3 s in the 2000 s hydrological measurements at hydrological station m6 showed that the mean river discharge decreased from 481 m3 s in the 1970 s to 62 m3 s in the 2000 s the mean river discharge at hydrological station m7 decreased even faster from 595 m3 s in the 1970 s to 28 m3 s in the 2000 s however the annual river discharge in the upstream showed less temporal variation than the river discharge in the downstream as evidenced by the hydrological monitoring at station m1 surkhandarya river the mean river discharge decreased slightly from 220 m3 s in the 1970 s to 204 m3 s in the 2000 s in addition evidence of decreased discharge was found along the river course of the adr from station m4 1026 m3 s to station m6 272 m3 s where it decreased by 74 over a longitudinal distance of 228 km the mean river water salinity observed at eight hydrological stations was less than 1000 mg l in the 1970 s however a notable increasing trend was exhibited in river water salinity from the 1970 s to the 1980 s in the 1980 s the average river water salinities at three sites namely m5 1038 mg l m6 1110 mg l and m7 1128 mg l were greater than 1000 mg l the river water salinity at site m4 922 mg l in the 1980 s was close to 1000 mg l then river water salinity remained relatively constant from the 1980 s to the 1990 s for example the mean river water salinities were 1007 mg l 1018 mg l and 983 mg l at the m5 m6 and m7 sites respectively which were slightly different from those in the 1980 s furthermore a notable increasing trend of river salinity appeared again at stations m6 m7 and m4 from the 1990 s to the 2000 s in the 2000 s 2000 2002 the mean river salinities at sites m6 1211 mg l m7 1560 mg l and m4 1009 mg l were all higher than 1000 mg l linear models between salinity and distance during the periods of 1970 1979 1980 1989 1990 1999 2000 2002 and 1970 2002 were developed fig 3 spatially a clear increasing trend pattern in river salinity was detected from upstream to downstream in the adr basin fig 2a which was indicated by the high correlation coefficient and r squared value fig 3 brackish water salinity higher than 1000 mg l mainly occurred downstream in contrast the water salinity at site m1 upstream was the lowest among the eight monitoring sites with values below 1000 mg l throughout the 1970 2000 s the annual river water salinities for 2000 2015 at the survey sites are shown in fig 4 compared with the other sites the highest river water salinity during the period of 2000 2010 was observed at site m6 notably water salinity at site m6 experienced significant decreases with a slope of 75 84 mg l per year from 2000 to 2010 in particular the annual river salinity at the m6 site declined to less than 1000 mg l after 2008 observations at site s2 kafirnigan river also showed negative trends with a slope of 19 49 mg l per year in annual river water salinity suggesting that river salinity declined from 2000 to 2015 in contrast river salinities at sites m2 and s1 showed increasing trends with slopes of 16 22 mg l per year and 22 26 mg l per year respectively the river salinities at sites m2 and s1 nearly reached 1000 mg l in 2015 river salinities at sites m3 m4 s4 located between m2 and m3 and s3 surkhandarya river did not show notable changing trends during the 2000 2015 period generally water salinities at sites m3 m4 s4 and s3 were less than 1000 mg l which meets the quality requirements for drinking and irrigation in particular the mean annual salinities at the s3 site were less than 600 mg l during the 2000 2015 period 3 2 seasonal variations in discharge and salinity the statistics for monthly river discharge and salinity at the hydrological stations of the adr are shown in tables s5 and s6 and the seasonal trends for river discharge and salinity are shown in table s7 as shown in fig 5 river discharge experienced notable seasonal variations the maximum monthly river discharge usually occurred during summer june august at all stations river discharge at four hydrological stations m1 m4 m5 and m6 had minimum values during winter december february the density shapes in the violin plots show that the distribution of monthly salinity is more uniform and symmetrical than that of river discharge especially at hydrological stations m6 and m7 fig 2 generally the highest monthly river salinity occurred in april except for stations m1 february and m4 march the lowest river salinity usually occurred in july september except for station m1 november spatially a clear pattern of increasing river salinization was detected from upstream to downstream in the adr basin the highest river salinity was observed at station m7 with a value of 3795 mg l the mean monthly water salinity increased by 80 during 1970 2002 for 1174 km from station m1 595 mg l to station m7 1073 mg l in terms of variations in salinity during the year the highest monthly average salinity values at the considered stations along the river were within the ranges of 596 1378 mg l m1 980 1737 mg l m4 911 2105 mg l m5 982 2574 mg l m6 942 3796 mg l m7 and 724 1371 mg l m8 as shown in fig 5 monthly river salinity exhibited a negative correlation with monthly river discharge at all stations however the negative relationship between river discharge and river salinity became less obvious along the river the most obvious negative relationship between river salinity and discharge was observed at hydrological station m1 upstream fig 5a while such a negative relationship was nonsignificant at station m8 downstream fig 5f along the river course from station m4 the boundary between the middle stream and downstream areas to m7 downstream the distance between sites m4 and m7 is 356 km the highest value of river salinity approximately doubled however the discharge was reduced by less than half 3 3 spatial patterns of river salinity discharge relationships river salinity discharge relationships and their correlation coefficients are shown in fig 6 and table s8 and residual plots were used to verify the reliability of the results the results show that river salinity discharge relationships displayed notable spatial longitudinal variations in the adr basin at hydrological stations m4 and m6 coefficient b in the general hyperbolic model eq 4 were higher than those at the other stations indicating that the flow dilution effect had predominant influences on river salinities at these two stations during both the 1970 1980 s and 1990 2000 s based on the comparisons of parameters a and b in the general hyperbolic model eq 4 among all stations we found that baseflow effects outweighed dilution effects at stations m1 m2 and m3 with larger values of a however dilution effects outweighed baseflow effects on the river salinities with higher values of b were observed at stations m4 m6 m7 and m8 additionally baseflow and dilution had comparable effects on river salinities at station m5 compared with the 1970 1980 s period reduced baseflow effects on river water salinities can be found during the 1990 2000 s at stations m1 and m4 however the baseflow effects on river water salinities exhibited increasing trends from the 1970 1980 s to 1990 2000 s at stations m5 m6 and m7 as shown in fig 7 in general the correlation coefficients between river salinity and river discharge during the growing season high flow are greater than those during the nongrowing season low flow it can be concluded that although the increased river salinities were mainly driven by human activities in the past decades the seasonal variations in river water salinity are controlled by the dilution effect of the river flow the correlation coefficients between river salinity and discharge of annual data in the 1970 1980 s are higher than those in the 1990 2000 s at stations m1 and m4 and the opposite cases are observed at stations m5 and m6 3 4 driving forces and conceptual model of river water salinization 3 4 1 river water salinization driven by natural processes and human activities as noted by cañedo argüelles et al 2013 and thorslund et al 2021 freshwater salinization is driven by both natural e g evaporation processes and anthropogenic e g agricultural activities factors our results fig 8 showed that the average nitrogen fertiliser use n agricultural water withdrawal aww and water salinity of return flow ws rf are the most influential factors in river salinity at stations m2 m4 and m6 respectively our analysis confirmed that anthropogenic factors associated with agricultural activities are predominant drivers of river water salinization in the adr which is consistent with previous studies in central asian rivers crosa et al 2006 karimov et al 2019 lobanova and didovets 2019 rakhmatullaev et al 2010 yapiyev et al 2021 globally as indicated by gibbs 1970 river water chemistry is generally controlled by atmospheric precipitation rock dominance and the evaporation crystallisation process for rivers in central asian arid regions ion concentrations in river water are increasing due to intensified evaporation from upstream to downstream the evaporation in the northwestern middle and downstream is higher than that in the southeastern upstream of the adr basin therefore this may be one of the reasons why the river salinity in the middle and downstream is greater than that in the upstream on the other hand river salinity can be reduced by dilution during periods of rainfall cañedo argüelles 2020 thorslund et al 2021 generally salinity is low where precipitation is greater spatially precipitation was higher in the southeastern adr basin than in the northwestern part temporally the annual precipitation exhibited an increasing trend 3 mm decade during 1960 2017 except for the southwestern part of the basin approximately 10 mm decade hu et al 2021 the effect of precipitation dilution on freshwater salinization is opposite to that of the enrichment of river water salinity by evaporation however the river water salinity in the adr did not decrease during the 1970 1990 s therefore increased precipitation failed to reduce the water salinity due to other factors e g water withdrawal for irrigation fertiliser usage and return flow a recent study has shown that human activities may be an important cause of temporal dynamics in river salinity moyano salcedo et al 2022 in the adr basin river salinization can also be caused by enhanced human activities which is evidenced by the fact that the population density increased approximately threefold in riverine countries throughout 1960 2020 fig s3 there have been no considerable increasing trends in urban and cropland areas during the past 50 years fig s4 shi et al 2021 yapiyev et al 2021 nevertheless agricultural activity intensified after the 1970 1980 s in the adr basin due to increased irrigation for water intensive crops elevated usage of pesticides and fertilisers and degraded irrigation and drainage canals shi et al 2021 törnqvist et al 2011 yapiyev et al 2021 our analysis showed that the irrigated areas in the downstream of the adr basin remained almost constant from 1991 to 2010 however the irrigated areas exhibited a slightly increasing trend in the middle stream fig s5 water withdrawal showed a slight decreasing trend in the middle and downstream areas during the period from 1991 to 2010 fig s5 moreover the river water salinity showed negative trends from 2000 to 2015 at most sites fig 4 irrigation and drainage activities in the adr basin are the main processes governing the spatial temporal pattern of salt content in the river together the volume and salinity of return flow likely shape the spatial and temporal patterns of freshwater salinization which is indicated by the consistent trends in the river water salinity of the considered stations during 1990 2010 in particular the return flow with a high salt load from drainage systems into the river is the major factor that shapes the salt dynamics in general river runoff in the adr has experienced a notable declining trend over the past half century and is expected to decrease by 10 20 by the end of the 21st century due to the influences of climate change and human activities in the adr basin hu et al 2021 white et al 2014 freshwater salinization has been exacerbated by decreased water volume and weakened dilution in the middle and downstream reaches of the adr due to increased water demands and withdrawals by agricultural and domestic users cañedo argüelles 2020 as noted by niedrist et al 2021 water resource extraction or agriculture are the main drivers of secondary salinization in arid and semiarid regions similarly secondary salinization is likely the main process of water salinization in the adr however in terms of the seasonal changes in salinity the main controlling factor of intra annual variation in salinity in the adr is flow salinity does not increase in april september which is the growing season when agricultural activities intensify e g increased pesticide use fertiliser use and irrigation water return flow in contrast water salinity decreases in the basin due to the high flows even in the lower reaches therefore in the adr intra annual variation in salinity is dominated by natural factors and simultaneously it is regulated by human activity timpano et al 2018 3 4 2 conceptual model of river water salinization there is significant spatial heterogeneity in freshwater salinization and salinity discharge relationships and their drivers in the adr basin under the combined effect of human activities and climate change fig 9 shows the processes and drivers of river water salinization in the adr basin in the upstream where river flows are high and the intensity of human activity is low the salinity of the water is mainly controlled by primary salinization e g snow melting precipitation although hydroelectric plant operations and mining can regulate water salinity they do not lead to a significant deterioration of salinization in the middle stream human activity is gradually intensifying and the salinity of the water is influenced by a combination of natural processes e g increased temperature and evaporation and human activity e g industrial and agricultural activities in the downstream and delta areas high intensity agricultural activities e g pesticides fertilisers irrigation water return flow control the process of water salinization in addition salinity accumulation also contributes to increasing salinization due to the flow concentration process this conceptual model can be applied to analyse the freshwater salinization processes in agriculturally dominated inland rivers recharged by snowmelt in semiarid to arid areas 3 5 uncertainties and limitations in this study we attempted to analyse the long term change patterns of salinity and flow in the adr based on a large amount of observational monthly data for water salinity and discharge however the data series were not consistent and varied year by year table s2 although we used a time step of a decade to reduce the potential random errors these uncertainties could not be eliminated entirely in addition data from different seasons may introduce uncertainty in the interpretation of the results estimated general hyperbolic models provided us with general knowledge about the spatiotemporal patterns of salinity discharge relationships in the adr although river discharge is the main driving factor for seasonal variation in river water salinity in the adr freshwater salinization is certainly influenced by other natural and human factors crosa et al 2006 in this study the potential drivers of river water salinity such as soil salinity and irrigation schemes were not considered in the rf models due to the lack of such data 4 conclusions in this study the spatial and temporal patterns of streamflow and river salinity in the adr basin during the past five decades were analysed comprehensively the results revealed that river salinity generally increased along the river course and the river water salinity exceeded the safe drinking and irrigation standard 1000 mg l in the middle and downstream areas especially in the downstream area temporally during the 1970 1990 s the river water salinity experienced a notable increasing trend however it gradually decreased after 2000 apart from natural salinization processes the increasing intensity of human activities including water withdrawal for crop irrigation and high salinity drainage and wastewater flows into the river is the predominant driver of river water salinization although limited success was achieved in controlling river water salinity during the 21st century more efforts are needed to mitigate challenges related to freshwater salinization and to realise regional sdgs recognising that freshwater salinization from agricultural activities is a growing problem thorslund et al 2021 a detailed analysis of freshwater salinization at subbasin or irrigated agricultural region scales is needed equally important such analyses require detailed irrigation data such as irrigation schemes and the location and quantities of return flow from main drains in terms of research methodology water quality modelling approaches can be performed to understand the salt dynamics in river reaches and bayesian model approaches can be applied to quantify the contributions of freshwater salinization drivers huang et al 2021a 2021b moreover the breakpoints in both trend and seasonal components can be detected by the break for the additive season and trend bfast method based on long term consecutive data verbesselt et al 2010 in addition more efforts are needed to analyse the interactions between freshwater salinization and the sdgs and to mitigate the potential trade offs among sdgs using the nexus approach flörke et al 2019 liu et al 2018 credit authorship contribution statement lingang hao conceptualization data curation

region the results indicate an overall decrease in the erosion rate as a combined effect of change in all the factors but at the same time an increase in the spatial extent of the areas affected by soil erosion is noticed the mean soil erosion rate varies between 37 02 tons ha ¹ yr ¹ in 1981 2000 and 31 89 tons ha ¹yr ¹ in 2001 2019 with a 40 decrease in the maximum erosion rate while the total

climate change is defined as the change in climate conditions such as long term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns that continue to occur for a longer time usually decades or more ipcc 2014 the rising temperature across the globe leads to an increase in the atmosphere s moisture content wang et al 2021 2022 eventually the regional weather circulation patterns are influenced by the elevating water vapor concentration in the atmosphere it results in shifting of weather circulation patterns affecting the frequency severity and amount of heavy rainstorms throughout the year wang et al 2017 myhre et al 2019 in many regions throughout the world climate change is predicted to affect soil erosion which will have an impact on ecological systems and social well being eekhout and de vente 2022 soil erosion in general is a detrimental hydro geological phenomenon that leads to a loss of soil fertility due to the degradation of plant nutrients in surface soil and promotes water pollution by increasing sedimentation it involves the detachment transportation and deposition of particles of soil transferred from place to place according to the fao led global soil partnership 75 billion tonnes pg of soil are lost annually from agricultural areas around the world resulting in an economic loss of us 400 billion each year borrelli et al 2017 during the soil erosion phenomenon water plays a vital role which is exacerbated by anthropogenic activities almost worldwide gabriels and cornelis 2009 specifically the change in climate and land use land cover lulc through extreme hydrological cycles are one of the leading causes of soil erosion borrelli et al 2020 it affects a range of physiochemical soil characteristics that drive infiltration and erosion mechanisms most of the previous studies over worldwide provided valuable information about soil erosion in the context of climate change e g rainfall erosivity is examined for various climate models and scenarios

fully grasped in terms of comparing variations in erosion rate by varying specific rusle model factors such as rainfall erosivity r crop management c conservation practice p while retaining other factors constant to show the variations of climate change and lulc change the studies have used various models including shetran de hipt et al 2019 swat dos santos et al 2021 usle mondal et al 2015 and rusle belay and mengistu 2021 only a few studies have considered the changes in land use and vegetation growth along with the effects of climate change on soil erosion because of the complexity e

ndvi normalized difference vegetation index resulting in a change in c factor k soil erodibility and ls slope length and steepness the rusle model can efficiently show the effect of land use pattern and the erosive power of rainfall on the erosion rate as a result it is essential to decouple the effects of rainfall and lulc change in order to understand if there is any individual effect over a specific region many earlier studies have verified the effectiveness of various erosion quantifying physical models liu et al 2006 wu and chen 2012 but in order to drive the physical models enormous amounts of data are needed which is difficult and problematic for studies that take place over a lengthy period of time over a larger area borrelli et al 2017 among all the empirical models the revised universal soil loss equation rusle is known for its versatility in field implementations and for being a standard tool for the adoption of conservational planning mahala 2018 in india runoff and soil loss data are limited and are usually obtained from gauging stations only patil et al 2008 however soil loss in ungauged watersheds needs to be determined accurately which is strenuous to quantify because the variables included in the erosion mechanism are complex for the same remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis are highly effective techniques for studying soil erosion jena et al 2018 gupta and kumar 2017 the rusle model integrated with rs and gis techniques provides usera friendly tool for identifying quantifying and mapping spatial distribution and prioritizing soil erosion prone areas efficiently and affordably which helps with improved planning and conservation activities eniyew et al 2021 thus the study aims to evaluate the soil erosion for two successive time periods viz 1981 2000 and 2001 2019 in the light of changing rainfall and lulc change by alternatingly varying various factors and keeping a particular factor constant for a control time period i e 1981 2000 to assess the erosion causing factors and resulting sedimentation towards downstream regions towards this rs and gis are integrated with the rusle model for basin scale soil erosion assessment and a rain fed river basin namely the upper part of the mahanadi basin being susceptible to water erosion is considered as the study basin there is a change in climate shift towards the end of the 20th century around the 2000 s houghton et al 2001 swanson et al 2009 wuebbles 2018 thus the temporal length of this study has been divided into two periods to assess the effect of this remarkable climate change on soil erosion the model outputs are validated using sediment delivery ratio sdr approach the approach can be used in other areas where observational data is scarce 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the upper mahanadi river basin covering the northeastern deccan plateau area of the mahanadi river basin between the latitude of 20 16 n and 22 75 n and longitude of 80 5 e and 82 5 e is selected for this study fig 1 the mahanadi river is india s seventh largest river and it flows from west to east it is draining a total coverage of 141 600 sq km representing 4 30 of india s entire geological area pichuka and maity 2017 asokan and dutta 2008 the total basin area of the upper mahanadi basin is 58 711 sq km with a perimeter of 2287 km including sixteen districts the important crops cultivated in the region include rice groundnut sugarcane millets and vegetables the average maximum temperature is 39 56 c while the average lowest temperature is 20 01 c the average highest relative humidity in the basin is 82 and the average lowest relative humidity is 31 6 water year book cwc 2014 the basin is located in the agro climatic area of the eastern plateau and hills water year book cwc 2014 the morphology of the mahanadi upper sub basin varies with the dominating mountainous terrain in the northern upper section having elevations ranging from 196 to 1136 m agricultural land covers the majority of the basin accounting for more than half of the total basin area soil texture in the study area is categorized as chromic vertisols ferric luvisols lithosols and chromic luvisols ferric luvisols account for a large proportion of the basin being prone to water erosion as it has medium to low tolerance to yield reduction and is moderately susceptible to degradation stocking and murnaghan 2013 the assessment of soil erosion is important for the basin given the physiographic and socio economic characteristics of the basin 2 2 description of data used digital elevation model dem land use land cover lulc map rainfall data normalized difference vegetation index ndvi map and soil characteristics such as sand silt and clay content and organic matter are essential for the rusle model daily rainfall data with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 is obtained from india meteorological department imd for 1981 2019 the entire length of data is divided into approximately two halves 1981 2000 and 2001 2019 to assess the spatio temporal variation in soil loss considering the pre 2000 period as the base period the soil characteristics i e percentages of sand silt clay and organic carbon content are obtained from harmonized world soil database hwsd version 1 2 with 30 arcs spatial resolution 900 m available at the food and agriculture organization of the united nations the dem of the study area with a 30 m spatial resolution is obtained shuttle radar topography mission srtm it is used in the computation of topographic parameters such as slope length and steepness factor the calculation of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi map and the supervised classification of land use land cover lulc map are carried out using landsat 5 satellite imageries for the years 1985 1990 and 2010 and landsat 8 imagery for the year 2015 image processing is carried out by google earth engine gee and arcgis version10 3 is used for developing spatial maps of various input variables of the rusle model since prior to the 1990 s landsat imageries did not cover the entire study area and significant changes are seen over a 5 year period following the 1990 s therefore we considered 1990 1995 2010 and 2015 for the calculation of ndvi and for the preparation of lulc map the calculation of median ndvi and supervised classification of lulc for the years 1985 1990 2010 and 2015 is carried out using the gee the sediment yield data for two time frames are collected from the central water commission cwc sediment concentration measuring stations of the upper mahanadi basin extracted from the hydro meteorological water yearbook of cwc the different sediment gauge stations along the upper mahanadi basin are shown in fig 1 2 3 model description the rusle model is used for the assessment of soil erosion it simplifies the complex physical mechanism for the long term rate of soil erosion over an extensive area while retaining the main factors affecting the mechanism for the forest and agricultural watersheds rusle has been extensively employed to evaluate annual average soil erosion through enhanced methods to compute the soil erosion parameters renard et al 1996 it is currently the most known modeling tool for simulating actual soil potential from coarser to finer spatial scales behera et al 2020 according to renard et al 1996 the rusle factors are computed using rainfall lulc topography and soil data after that the dynamics of streamflow and soil erosion can be assessed using a direct correlation between rainfall and runoff this approach is broadly adopted to evaluate the soil loss and therefore its hazard assessment guides in rehabilitating the areas prone to erosion by adopting appropriate management policies biswas and pani 2015 ostovari et al 2017 2 4 rusle model parameterization the rusle model comprises five input factors to compute the mean annual soil erosion in a region the formulation is expressed as 1 a r k ls c p where k indicates the soil erodibility factor ton ha 1mj 1mm 1 r indicates the rainfall erosivity factor mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 ls indicates the topographic factor dimensionless p is the conservation practice factor dimensionless 0 1 c indicates the cover management factor dimensionless 0 1 5 a indicates the mean annual potential soil loss tons ha 1 yr 1 all these factors are discussed one by one 2 4 1 rainfall erosivity factor rainfall erosivity factor r is the potential of rainfall to separate the soil particles from the soil layer it is the measure of the erosive strength of rainfall it depends on the intensity duration and volume of the precipitation and it can be calculated as a specific rainstorm or sequence of rainstorms to calculate erosivity cumulatively the most common type of erosion in barren land is splash erosion the value of r factor is computed from eq 2 it was originally developed by wischmeier and smith 1978 to establish the relation between rainfall depth and rainfall erosivity and afterward amended by arnoldus 1980 for the inclusion of monthly rainfall dynamics 2 r i 1 12 1 735 10 1 5 log p i 2 p 0 08188 where p is the average annual rainfall magnitude mm p i is the rainfall of i th month mm r is an average rainfall erosivity factor mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 2 4 2 soil erodibility factor soil erodibility factor k is the vulnerability of the top layer of soil to erosion sediment transport capacity and runoff rates under standard conditions it is measured as the soil loss on a 22 13 m long plot with 9 slope kept in constant fallow tilled along the slope of a hill weesies et al 1998 the k factor value is calculated by adopting the eq 3 given by wischmeier and smith 1978 3 k 1 2917 2 1 10 4 m 1 14 12 om 3 25 s 2 2 5 ρ 3 100 where om refers to the of organic matter content in the soil s indicates the value corresponding to structural classes 1 for very fine granular 2 for fine granular 3 for medium or coarse granular and 4 for blocky platy or massive structure ρ indicates the value corresponding to the permeability class 1 for rapid 2 for moderate to rapid 3 for moderate 4 for slow to moderate 5 for slow and 6 for very slow permeability rate and m is a function of soil primary particle size fraction given by m of silt of very fine sand x 100 of clay the study area has three types of soil with different soil characteristics as used in eq 3 2 4 3 topographic factor the slope length and steepness collectively called the topographic factor ls is the linear distance joining the beginning of the overland flow and the point where slope length lowers for the deposition process the equation for evaluating the ls factor in the rusle model considers rill erosion unlike the usle model in specific the moving process of the erosion mechanism is controlled mainly by the topographical factor the ls factor is computed from eq 4 mitasova and mitas 2001 4 ls fa cs 22 13 0 4 sin θ 0 0896 1 3 where fa is the flow accumulation and cs is the cell size of the dem data in our case 30 m θ is the slope angle of the drainage basin in degrees 2 4 4 cover management factor the cover management factor c is the ratio of soil loss from cultivated land to relative soil loss from continuous clean tilled fallow land in specific conditions several researchers allocated the c factor on the basis of lulc however the changes in vegetation cover and density were not included in these analyses therefore in this analysis normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is used to consider variability between scrubland and forests to calculate the ndvi for every pixel in the study area eq 5 is used jena et al 2018 5 ndvi nir red nir red where nir and red are the measures of spectral reflectance obtained in the near infrared and visible spectrum respectively the value of ndvi lies between 1 and 1 within the near infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum the photosynthetically active vegetation exhibits high reflectivity as compared to the red portion therefore very high values of ndvi are observed for active photosynthesis vegetation the c factor is computed from eq 6 durigon et al 2014 6 c e 2 ndvi 1 ndvi 2 4 5 support practice factor the support practice p is the ratio between soil loss through a particular management practice to the relative loss with up and downslope plowing renard et al 1996 the p factor in the current study is allocated in accordance with the management practices for different lulc as represented in table s1 in supplementary material the value varies between 0 and 1 with the highest value for land without management practice and the lowest value for land with management practices 2 5 climate change effect analysis the most severe environmental alteration is expected as a consequence of climate change perović et al 2019 the soil erosion quantification is subject to vary in the perspective of climate change in response to changes in rainfall vegetation indices and lulc over time periods the magnitude and intensity of rainfall directly affect the rusle model as a result a modified evaluation of the rainfall erosivity r factor for different time periods is inevitable under the climate change aspect in this regard the r factors for two time periods 1981 2000 and 2001 2019 are determined the most significant connection among the soil soil moisture and the atmosphere is the vegetation chuai et al 2013 seasonal as well as annual climate variations affect natural vegetation bagherzadeh et al 2020 zhang et al 2011 cui and shi 2010 in this study the ndvi for the years 1990 and 1995 are calculated and the spatial map for both years are averaged using raster calculator in the arcgis environment to prepare a spatially distributed ndvi map for the time frame 1981 2000 similarly the spatially distributed ndvi map for the years 2010 and 2015 are averaged to account for soil loss estimation for the period of 2001 2019 change in land productivity that contributes to lulc change is also a crucial aspect to assess soil erosion land use planning and ecological growth need a thorough knowledge of the spatiotemporal variation of soil erosion on account of lulc change keesstra et al 2016 the spatially distributed lulc map for both the time periods viz 1981 2000 and 2001 2019 are computed by calculating the average of the spatially distributed lulc map of 1990 and 1995 for the time period 1981 2000 and the lulc maps of 2010 and 2015 are used to prepare the lulc map for the time frame 2001 2019 the average map is prepared using the raster calculator in the arcgis environment furthermore the topographic factor soil type and soil texture are subject to very slow alterations over the years behera et al 2020 thus the soil erodibility factor k a function of soil type and the topographic factor ls a function of slope length and steepness are considered as constant in this study in this study three analyses are performed keeping the k factor and ls factor as constant in all the analyses to delineate the effects of other factors related to climate and terrestrial conditions on soil erosion firstly the coupled effects of three changing factors viz the r factor c factor and p factor on erosion rate are observed by updating all the three factors for the time periods of analysis pre and post 2000 subsequently the individual effects of change in rainfall and lulc over time are analyzed for that in the second analysis the influence of lulc variations on erosion rate is assessed by considering 1981 2000 as the control period varying c and p factors and assuming the r factor as constant throughout the time in the last analysis the influence of changing rainfall on erosion is assessed by taking the p factor as constant over time while the c factor and r factor are varied by anticipating 1981 2000 as the control period using the methodology discussed for calculating c factor r factor and p factor different maps are prepared for both time periods of 1981 2000 and 2001 2019 furthermore these factors are multiplied with k factor and ls factor in developing a potential soil erosion map intended for respective time periods the operational flow chart of the overall methodological approach is shown in fig 2 2 6 validation using sediment yield data when soil erodes a portion of it is moved through the channel section and makes a significant contribution to sediment yield whereas the remaining portion is stored in the channel multiple soil erosion and sedimentation studies have been conducted to analyze the relationship between soil loss inside a drainage basin and sediment yield sy at the outlet point the sediment delivery ratio sdr a lumped concept can be used to calculate the sy the sdr is defined as the ratio of sediment yield calculated at a channel point to gross highlands soil erosion including sheet rill gully and channel erosion however the rusle only estimates rill and inter rill or sheet erosion which is regarded as a significant contributing factor to gross erosion this concept of sdr takes into account a number of processes that occur throughout on site soil erosion and the sediment yield at the outlet van rompaey et al 2001 a variety of factors can influence sdr including channel density sediment source proximity to the mainstream texture basin area length slope rainfall runoff factors and land use land cover the sdr of a watershed with steep slopes is greater than that of a watershed with flat and broad valleys in general the lesser the sdr the greater the area size several sdr models have been developed and utilized to determine sy as tabulated in table s5 in supplementary material however the selection of the best sdr model for a certain basin is cumbersome owing to the lack of studies involving this technique using observational data the drainage area method as given in eq 7 is the most commonly and widely used method for estimating sdr de vente et al 2007 7 sdr a d b where d is the drainage basin area in km2 and a and b are correction factors related to the physical characteristics of the basin the adjustment b variable has a negative sign as it signifies that with an increase in the basin area the sdr decreases the various sdr models extensively used in the literature are provided in table s2 in supplementary material in this study we have used observed sediment yield values obtained from cwc s sediment concentration measuring stations in the study basin the average sy data is collected from 1981 to 2019 the average sy for the periods is calculated for twelve sub basins of the study basin namely andhiyarkore bamnidih baronda basantpur ghatora jondhra kotni manendragarh rajim rampur seorinarayan and simga having sediment gauging station fig 1 for the periods 1981 2000 and 2001 2019 using these data the parameters in eq 7 are calibrated for the study basin as discussed later in results and discussion section finally the estimated sediment yield sy est is evaluated as follows 8 sy est sdr gsl where gsl is the gross soil loss and both sy est and gsl are in tons yr 1 3 results and discussion the spatial variation of mean annual precipitation for two successive periods 1981 2000 and 2001 2019 is shown in fig s1a and fig s2b respectively in supplementary material it is observed that average rainfall per year differs from 915 mm to 1623 mm with the maximum value confined to the northern part of the basin during the years 1981 2000 and from 960 mm to 1414 mm with the maximum value found in the southern and most of the northern areas of the basin during 2001 2019 the rainfall erosivity factor r as shown in fig s1c and s1d in supplementary material ranges between 2029 and 8168 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 during 1981 2000 and from 40 to 4609 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 during 2001 2019 it is noticed that the northwestern part of the basin such as the kawardha and mungeli districts having low r factor during 1981 2000 is found to have a slight increase in r factor during 2001 2019 on the other hand the central part of the basin such as bemetara baloda bazar raipur and mahasmund is found to have more drastic increase in r factor during 2001 2019 the southeastern part of the basin spanning over the gariaband and kanker districts having medium r factor during 1981 2000 exhibits more r factor during 2001 2019 similarly the southern part of the basin balod dhamatari and durg districts is characterized by medium r factor during 1981 2000 that reduces during 2001 2019 the rest of the basin area is noticed to have more or less steady r factor for the considered time periods it is observed that the higher r factor is spatially distributed over northern and southwestern regions during 1981 2000 and over northern and eastern parts during 2001 2019 this may be the result of erratic rainfall across the study area and the similar phenomena were also reported for huaihe river basin china by wei et al 2022 and yangtze river basin china by huang et al 2013 peng et al 2022 suggested that the rise in rainfall intensity would result in higher erosion rates soil erodibility is a measurement of a soil s cohesive character which is governed by the physical and chemical characteristics of soil and thus influencing its erodibility potential the spatially distributed k factor map is illustrated in fig s2a in supplementary material the k factor varies as 0 043 tons h mj 1 mm 1 for clay soil 0 065 ton h mj 1 mm 1 for loam soil 0 069 ton h mj 1 mm 1 for sandy clay loam soil and 0 075 ton h mj 1 mm 1 for sandy loam soil it is noticed that a large part of the basin is covered by sandy loam soil with a maximum k factor value lower k values are found for clay soil covering the least part i e 0 029 of the study area in clay soil the higher percentage of clay than sand has a more cohesive nature that binds the soil particles thus reducing its susceptibility to erosion the topographic factor defines the impact of slope steepness s and slope length l factors on soil erosion the results represented in fig s2b in supplementary material shows that 94 25 of the watershed has ls value 5 indicating a less varied topography of the basin correspondingly 3 09 2 09 0 37 0 07 and 0 09 of the basin have ls value in the range of 5 10 10 25 25 50 50 75 and 75 respectively table s2 in supplementary material ndvi is calculated to measure the c factor the ndvi gives more detail regarding the density and condition of the vegetation cover it better represents the spatial variation of the factor c for the two successive years as illustrated in fig s3 in supplementary material low c factor values are associated with dense forests while high values are associated with fallow lands and crop fields as observed from the results the percentage of area covered under each class of c factor for two successive periods is compared in table s3 in supplementary material the c factor value ranging from 0 3 to 0 5 accounted for 88 39 of the study area during 1981 2000 that increased to 89 02 during 2001 2019 as soil surfaces are considered vulnerable to bare soil and pastureland a higher value of the c factor indicates more susceptibility to soil erosion dash et al 2021 therefore the higher range for the c factor of 0 7 1 implies increased soil erosion susceptibility since they are assessed as exposed soil surfaces it is depicted that an insignificant rise in the area coverage made up 0 001 1981 2000 to 0 007 2001 2019 for the c factor value of 0 7 1 however a decline is elucidated for the area coverage for the c factor value of 0 0 1 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 from 1981 to 2000 2000 2019 the c factor value of 0 1 0 3 is found to be decreased for some northwestern southwestern and central parts of the basin covering the districts such as rajnandgaon kawardha bemetara and bilaspur whereas it is found to be increased in the northeastern southeastern and southern parts of the basin including districts like korba dhamatari gariaband and mahasmund during 2001 2019 the decline in c factor values in some parts of the area over the years suggests a decrement in soil erosion rate the p factor denotes the decreased soil erosion threat caused by supportive management structures implemented in a particular area it s value is allocated based on various lulc classes the average of the lulc map for the years 1990 and 1995 fig s4a in supplementary material is considered to evaluate the p factor for the time period of 1981 2000 fig s4c in supplementary material likewise the average of the lulc map for the years 2010 and 2015 fig s4b in supplementary material is considered to evaluate the p factor for the time period of 2001 2019 fig s4d in supplementary material it is found that the maximum part of the basin is covered by agricultural cropland table s4 in supplementary material depicts the areal distribution for the lulc over two successive periods it is observed that there is a decline in forest cover 25 5 22 93 and fallow land 28 95 22 22 from 1981 to 2000 2001 2019 however there is an increase in water bodies 0 55 0 96 agricultural cropland 35 84 39 05 built up 1 38 4 94 and barren land 7 78 9 9 over the years this shows that most of the study area is affected by climate change the p factor value ranges from 0 to 1 the maximum value for p factor in 1981 2000 is found to be surrounding some parts of the northern southern and eastern basin area koriya manendragarh kanker mahasamund and baloda bazar that has been decreased during 2001 2019 however the area of the basin covering the northwestern part of the basin kawardha and mungeli shows an increase in p factor value for the year 2001 2019 than in 1980 2000 considering the outcomes of all the rusle factors for both the time periods i e 1981 2000 and 2001 2019 three further analyses are carried out the factors so prepared in raster map form are multiplied in the raster calculator in arcgis 10 3 system to obtain spatially distributed erosion map the spatially distributed maps of soil erosion are reclassified into eight erosion classes by following the consumer specified classification criterion the erosion classes along with the percentage of areal coverage for all three analyses are provided in table 1 the average annual potential soil erosion varying pixel wise across the upper mahanadi basin for all three analyses are depicted in fig s5 in supplementary material overall in all three analyses the erosion rate including the maximum mean and total erosion rate are observed to be reduced during 2001 2019 than during 1981 2000 period as depicted in table 2 in the first analysis the average annual soil erosion is estimated concerning the coupled effect of factors such as conservation practice p factor crop management c factor and rainfall erosivity r factor keeping other factors namely topographic ls factor and erodibility k factor constant over the years from the study it is found that the mean soil erosion rate varies as 37 02 ton ha 1 yr 1 in 1981 2000 and 31 89 ton ha 1 yr 1 in 2001 2019 with a decrement of maximum rate from 2 5 105 ton ha 1 yr 1 1981 2000 to 1 5 105 ton ha 1 yr 1 2001 2019 the total erosion rate is about 217 35 million ton yr 1 1981 2000 and 187 23 million ton yr 1 2001 2019 the maximum erosion rate is decreased by 40 whereas the total and mean erosion rate is decreased by and 13 85 with respect to 1981 2000 it is observed that there is a gradual decline in soil erosion seen in the northern and eastern parts of the basin over the years the region with the greatest percentage drop is found to be laid out with vegetation with a decline in rainfall over the years and are having reduced slope the maximum soil erosion for both the time periods is found at the northern part of the basin i e at chirimiri the largest city and a hill station with steep slopes of the manendragarh district of chhattisgarh fig s5 in supplementary material furthermore habtu and jayappa 2022 confirmed that the north and northeastern sections of their study region with hilly and mountainous topography have a moderate to extremely severe erosion vulnerability due to steep slopes and high rainfall from the reclassified erosion map it is found that the area under the negligible erosion group 5 10 tons ha 1 yr 1 covers the maximum part of the basin while the least area is under severe erosion for both time periods nonetheless it covers 67 4 of the area during 1981 2000 which climbs up to 71 5 during 2001 2019 this shows that it is highly likely for those places to face increased soil erosion hazards in the future however the rest of the reclassified erosion rates table 5 are observed to decline over the years for that basin area this is attributed to the increasing spatial coverage of the study region as corroborated by other works allafta and opp 2022 habtu and jayappa 2022 besides this could be due to change in rainfall change in crop management practices and lulc over the periods since rainfall acts as a vital contributor to the soil erosion processes climate change is likely to affect soil erosion through changes in rainfall mondal et al 2015 soil erosion may be increased or decreased as a result of lulc changes changes in lulc i e the spread of cultivated area lead to increased soil erosion which is expected to intensify with increased precipitation belay and mengistu 2021 the areal extent in terms of percentage for the change in erosion rate for the three analyses are illustrated in table 3 the change in erosion rate along with the areal coverage for each categorized change rate for all three analyses is shown in fig 3 for the first analysis almost 83 area of the study region exhibits a reduced change in the erosion rate during 2001 2019 as compared to the past time frame i e 1981 2000 nearly 19 area shows a negative change in erosion rate mostly across the northern and southern parts wherein for 64 of the entire study area the reduction lies in the range of 5 0 tons ha 1 yr 1 it is found that the r and c factor declines during 2001 2019 prior to 1981 2000 moreover during 2001 2019 it is observed that there are more built up areas and water bodies less fallow land and forest areas influencing the p factor all these factors r c p together represent the higher decline in erosion rate during 2001 2019 than 1981 2000 the rainfall erosivity factor r is an important factor that results in soil erosion wei et al 2022 he et al 2022 and kabolizadeh et al 2022 showed that the potential of erosion decreases along with the value of rainfall erosivity r factor an effective indicator of soil erosion is vegetation cover it can gradually reduce overall soil loss by protecting the topsoil from the direct effects of precipitation novara et al 2019 there has been an increase in vegetation cover during 2001 2019 than 1981 2000 that result in a decrease in the c factor and thus the erosion rate other studies kavian et al 2019 almohamad 2020 macedo et al 2021 kabolizadeh et al 2022 have made reference to this and the findings of this study are similar with those for this study the sdr approach is used for validating the outcomes of this research our findings revealed that sy levels are overestimated the substantial inaccuracies could be due to observations that were made with probable uncertainty and or model development uncertainty our findings regarding overestimation of sediment yield quite resembled to the study done on sediment yield modelling in tawi river of jammu region india by rawat et al 2022 due to the great complexity of the sediment delivery mechanism and the necessity to examine the interrelationship between their intervenient components to adapt the equation it is difficult to develop a universal equation to estimate the sdr in a basin walling 1983 on that account we adjusted sdr equation by vanoni 1975 accordingly to minimize the disparity between the estimated and observed sediment yield sy obs and sy est for our study area the twelve sub basins are divided into two thirds for calibration and one third for validation purposes thus 3 fold cross validation is used to obtain a more accurate and dependable coefficient of sdr for the study basin the value of a from eq 7 is optimized considering a wide range of values from 0 05 to 0 5 the optimum value of a is selected based on the least rmse between sy obs and sy est and a reasonable difference between calibration and validation error across the folds and two time periods results of 3 fold cross validation reveal that eq 9 is the best suited for predicting sdr for the study basin d in km 2 9 sdr 0 1 d 0 125 the plot between the observed and predicted sediment yield data for both the time periods is represented in fig 4 the twelve sediment gauge stations along with their respective sdr sy obs and sy est for both 1981 2000 and 2001 2019 time periods are represented in table 4 overall it is observed that the gross soil erosion and the sediment yield over the basin reduces in 2001 2019 as compared to 1981 2000 a spearman s rank correlation analysis was performed for average annual rainfall and average annual soil erosion for both period of datasets during 1981 2000 soil erosion and rainfall were strongly positively correlated r 0 525 p 0 01 while during the period 2001 2019 soil erosion and rainfall were moderately correlated r 0 160 p 0 01 the preliminary correlation analysis suggests that the rainfall have a positive impact on the soil loss while more detailed analysis is required to explore the full mechanism since soil loss depends on the duration of rainfall and more importantly rainfall intensity the effect of rainfall frequency and intensity can show more positive correlation with erosion a similar type of study on the comparison of rainfall and erosion has been done earlier by various researchers martínez mena et al 2020 evaluated the effects of various sustainable management practices on erosion in two rainfed systems in spain they found that the spearman s correlation between rainfall erosivity and soil erosion was found to be 0 52 with p 0 01 and they found that erosive responses were correlated much more closely with the rainfall intensity than with the rainfall depth huang et al 2020 found that spearman s rank correlation analysis showed actual soil loss related to annual rainfall positively strong correlation was r 0 7 observed in more than 50 area and were statistically significant at 95 confidence level the second analysis shows the impact of variation in lulc p factor on erosion rate the maximum mean and total erosion rate are found to be 1 55 105 tons ha 1 yr 1 32 27 tons ha 1 yr 1 and 189 46 million tons yr 1 respectively from the reclassified erosion map as shown in fig s5 in supplementary material it is found that the area under each erosion class is nearly the same as in the case of the first analysis conducted the analysis shows that while c and p factor are changed keeping r factor constant the maximum erosion rate is found to be almost the same as the erosion rate considering all the factors changing overtime in the first analysis the mean erosion rate and total erosion rate are slightly increased in the second analysis 32 27 tons ha yr and 189 46 tons ha yr respectively with respect to the first analysis 31 89 tons ha yr and 187 23 tons ha yr respectively around 82 23 of the study region shows a decline in erosion rate with time as illustrated in fig 3 almost 17 06 of the study area indicates a decrease in erosion rate particularly in the north and southern parts with 65 17 of the study area experiencing a drop in the range of 5 0 tons ha 1 yr 1 there is a little variation in erosion rate when coupled effects of all the changing factors are compared with the constant rainfall factor on the erosion rate over the years this explains that change in rainfall when combined with lulc and ndvi variations gives quite a similar result when change in rainfall is considered fixed along with changing lulc and ndvi variations it can be seen from fig s4a and s4b in supplementary material that with varying decades there is a shift toward built up land resulting in less or the same infiltration rate lulc constituted of more establishments towards 2001 2019 have less p factor value that contributes towards declined erosion rate in the study area there seems to have a positive correlation between the p factor value and the erosion rate this outcome is in line with findings from other studies wijesundara et al 2018 naqvi et al 2013 prasannakumar et al 2012 jena et al 2018 the third analysis shows the impact of changing rainfall on erosion rate in the third analysis the maximum mean and total erosion rate are found to be 1 90 105 tons ha 1 yr 1 35 23 tons ha 1 yr 1 206 83 million tons yr 1 over here distinguished change is observed in almost all categorized erosion ranges most remarkably the negligible erosion group 5 10 tons ha 1 yr 1 covering around 67 48 of the study region is found to be reduced in terms of the areal extent with respect to the first two analyses this explains that while lulc p factor is considered to be constant over the years and r factor along with c factor is changed the erosion rate increases this current analysis shows that the change in rainfall have more influence on erosion rate rather than other factors the change in rainfall and soil loss have a strong correlation between them a significant increase in rainfall amount is typically followed by the rise in soil erosion nigam et al 2017 while there is a mixed effect of both increase and decrease in erosion rate along with time towards the northern and southern part of the study region in the first and second analysis there is an inconsiderable increase in erosion rate towards northern and southern parts of the study area during 2001 2019 in the third analysis while the first and second analyses show a blended effect of both increase and decrease in erosion rate towards the northern and southern parts of the study region the third analysis shows an insignificant increase in erosion rate toward the northern and southern parts of the study region from 2001 to 2019 with respect to 1981 2000 in the third analysis there is a rise in erosion rate with very scanty declines in the middle part of the research area in contrast to the diverse results in the first and second analyses the change in erosion rate is almost the same for the first two analyses for each categorized class in contrast in the third analysis the change in erosion rate is considerably varying from the rest analysis as shown in table 3 spatial variation of erosivity is noticed in all the analyses and the maximum soil detachment has occurred due to varying rainfall amount the erosion rate is found to be directly proportional to the rainfall depth in the majority of locations this finding is also supported by previous studies that established soil erosion is considerably influenced due to differences in rainfall erosivity zhang liu 2005 nearing et al 2004 shiono et al 2013 increased precipitation intensity is expected to result in increased soil degradation which has also been concluded by zhang et al 2011 this is observed that the change in mean rainfall amount as reflected in r factor affects the erosion rate more than the lulc change similarly de hipt et al 2019 belay and mengistu 2021 and dos santos et al 2021 found that the climate change has a larger impact on erosion than lulc as anticipated this study shows that the climate change in terms of change in rainfall and lulc significantly increases spatial variation and becomes the major contributing factor to change in soil erosion rate over the study area despite the major findings gleaned from this study it is realized that higher spatial resolution satellite data can shed more light on the results of this research this limitation can be addressed in future studies by collecting sentinel imageries for the assessment besides the use of only one erosion model is a constraint to this study the use of multi model approaches could enhance understanding of uncertainty resulting from model choice 4 conclusions the effect of climate change on soil erosion using gis integrated rusle model is investigated in a rainfed basin through analyzing the change in rainfall and lulc the maximum mean and total erosion rates for all the analyses during 2001 2019 were less than during 1981 2000 the maximum erosion rate decreased by 40 whereas the total and mean erosion rates reduced by 13 85 for 1981 2000 when all the factors r c p were varied over the years whereas with r constant and varying p and c factors it was observed that there was a 40 38 decrease in maximum erosion rate and 12 83 decrease in total and mean erosion rate with respect to 1981 2000 similarly by varying r and c factor and with p factor as constant it was observed that there was a 26 92 decrease in maximum erosion rate and 4 84 decrease in mean and total erosion rate it was also noticed that the erosion class from 5 to 10 ton ha 1 yr 1 covers 67 4 of the study area during 1981 2000 which elevates to 71 5 71 59 and 67 48 during 2001 2019 in the first second and third analyses respectively thus it was not the total amount of erosion but the spatial extent of the zone that increased due to changes in the climate the model yielded acceptable sdr and sy estimates and it can be used to predict sy in similar rain fed basins with sparse data and ungauged basins besides the identified suitable locations and the anticipated changes in the soil erosion risk will help administrators consider soil management measures in erosion prone sites over the years in addition the proposed methods for evaluating the risks of soil loss in a climate change context can be widely applied at the basin scale by performing basin specific calibration and validation credit authorship contribution statement sushree sangita dash methodology formal analysis writing original draft preparation rajib maity

7636,study region mahanadi river basin in india study focus this study explores the effect of climate change and human induced farming and construction activities on soil erosion in a rainfed basin during two time periods viz 1981 2000 and 2001 2019 this study assesses erosion using the geographic information system integrated revised universal soil loss equation gis integrated rusle model three different analyses are designed to assess the effect i combined effect of change in all the rusle factors over these two time periods ii effect of only land use cover change lulc and iii only rainfall change impact on erosion rate a modified sediment delivery ratio sdr has been proposed and the model performances are validated using the observed sediment yield data new hydrological insights for the region the results indicate an overall decrease in the erosion rate as a combined effect of change in all the factors but at the same time an increase in the spatial extent of the areas affected by soil erosion is noticed the mean soil erosion rate varies between 37 02 tons ha ¹ yr ¹ in 1981 2000 and 31 89 tons ha ¹yr ¹ in 2001 2019 with a 40 decrease in the maximum erosion rate while the total and mean erosion rates are both down 13 85 compared to 1981 2000 the analysis suggested overall effect of the change in rainfall is more profound on erosion than lulc change graphical abstract ga1

climate change is defined as the change in climate conditions such as long term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns that continue to occur for a longer time usually decades or more ipcc 2014 the rising temperature across the globe leads to an increase in the atmosphere s moisture content wang et al 2021 2022 eventually the regional weather circulation patterns are influenced by the elevating water vapor concentration in the atmosphere it results in shifting of weather circulation patterns affecting the frequency severity and amount of heavy rainstorms throughout the year wang et al 2017 myhre et al 2019 in many regions throughout the world climate change is predicted to affect soil erosion which will have an impact on ecological systems and social well being eekhout and de vente 2022 soil erosion in general is a detrimental hydro geological phenomenon that leads to a loss of soil fertility due to the degradation of plant nutrients in surface soil and promotes water pollution by increasing sedimentation it involves the detachment transportation and deposition of particles of soil transferred from place to place according to the fao led global soil partnership 75 billion tonnes pg of soil are lost annually from agricultural areas around the world resulting in an economic loss of us 400 billion each year borrelli et al 2017 during the soil erosion phenomenon water plays a vital role which is exacerbated by anthropogenic activities almost worldwide gabriels and cornelis 2009 specifically the change in climate and land use land cover lulc through extreme hydrological cycles are one of the leading causes of soil erosion borrelli et al 2020 it affects a range of physiochemical soil characteristics that drive infiltration and erosion mechanisms most of the previous studies over worldwide provided valuable information about soil erosion in the context of climate change e g rainfall erosivity is examined for various climate models and scenarios adopted by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc while other factors such as lulc are held constant chakrabortty et al 2020 pal chakrabortty 2019 gupta and kumar 2017 khare et al 2017 doulabian et al 2021 in context of both climate and lulc change op de hipt et al 2019 dos santos et al 2021 belay and mengistu 2021 pal et al 2021 to observe changes in erosion using various models taking spatiotemporal variability into account although several studies have been done on the coupled and individual effects of climate and lulc variations on soil erosion the background is still not fully grasped in terms of comparing variations in erosion rate by varying specific rusle model factors such as rainfall erosivity r crop management c conservation practice p while retaining other factors constant to show the variations of climate change and lulc change the studies have used various models including shetran de hipt et al 2019 swat dos santos et al 2021 usle mondal et al 2015 and rusle belay and mengistu 2021 only a few studies have considered the changes in land use and vegetation growth along with the effects of climate change on soil erosion because of the complexity e g cultural socioeconomic ecological and political li and fang 2016 considering the variation in lulc leading to a change in p factor changes in rainfall reflecting the change in r factor change in ndvi normalized difference vegetation index resulting in a change in c factor k soil erodibility and ls slope length and steepness the rusle model can efficiently show the effect of land use pattern and the erosive power of rainfall on the erosion rate as a result it is essential to decouple the effects of rainfall and lulc change in order to understand if there is any individual effect over a specific region many earlier studies have verified the effectiveness of various erosion quantifying physical models liu et al 2006 wu and chen 2012 but in order to drive the physical models enormous amounts of data are needed which is difficult and problematic for studies that take place over a lengthy period of time over a larger area borrelli et al 2017 among all the empirical models the revised universal soil loss equation rusle is known for its versatility in field implementations and for being a standard tool for the adoption of conservational planning mahala 2018 in india runoff and soil loss data are limited and are usually obtained from gauging stations only patil et al 2008 however soil loss in ungauged watersheds needs to be determined accurately which is strenuous to quantify because the variables included in the erosion mechanism are complex for the same remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis are highly effective techniques for studying soil erosion jena et al 2018 gupta and kumar 2017 the rusle model integrated with rs and gis techniques provides usera friendly tool for identifying quantifying and mapping spatial distribution and prioritizing soil erosion prone areas efficiently and affordably which helps with improved planning and conservation activities eniyew et al 2021 thus the study aims to evaluate the soil erosion for two successive time periods viz 1981 2000 and 2001 2019 in the light of changing rainfall and lulc change by alternatingly varying various factors and keeping a particular factor constant for a control time period i e 1981 2000 to assess the erosion causing factors and resulting sedimentation towards downstream regions towards this rs and gis are integrated with the rusle model for basin scale soil erosion assessment and a rain fed river basin namely the upper part of the mahanadi basin being susceptible to water erosion is considered as the study basin there is a change in climate shift towards the end of the 20th century around the 2000 s houghton et al 2001 swanson et al 2009 wuebbles 2018 thus the temporal length of this study has been divided into two periods to assess the effect of this remarkable climate change on soil erosion the model outputs are validated using sediment delivery ratio sdr approach the approach can be used in other areas where observational data is scarce 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the upper mahanadi river basin covering the northeastern deccan plateau area of the mahanadi river basin between the latitude of 20 16 n and 22 75 n and longitude of 80 5 e and 82 5 e is selected for this study fig 1 the mahanadi river is india s seventh largest river and it flows from west to east it is draining a total coverage of 141 600 sq km representing 4 30 of india s entire geological area pichuka and maity 2017 asokan and dutta 2008 the total basin area of the upper mahanadi basin is 58 711 sq km with a perimeter of 2287 km including sixteen districts the important crops cultivated in the region include rice groundnut sugarcane millets and vegetables the average maximum temperature is 39 56 c while the average lowest temperature is 20 01 c the average highest relative humidity in the basin is 82 and the average lowest relative humidity is 31 6 water year book cwc 2014 the basin is located in the agro climatic area of the eastern plateau and hills water year book cwc 2014 the morphology of the mahanadi upper sub basin varies with the dominating mountainous terrain in the northern upper section having elevations ranging from 196 to 1136 m agricultural land covers the majority of the basin accounting for more than half of the total basin area soil texture in the study area is categorized as chromic vertisols ferric luvisols lithosols and chromic luvisols ferric luvisols account for a large proportion of the basin being prone to water erosion as it has medium to low tolerance to yield reduction and is moderately susceptible to degradation stocking and murnaghan 2013 the assessment of soil erosion is important for the basin given the physiographic and socio economic characteristics of the basin 2 2 description of data used digital elevation model dem land use land cover lulc map rainfall data normalized difference vegetation index ndvi map and soil characteristics such as sand silt and clay content and organic matter are essential for the rusle model daily rainfall data with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 is obtained from india meteorological department imd for 1981 2019 the entire length of data is divided into approximately two halves 1981 2000 and 2001 2019 to assess the spatio temporal variation in soil loss considering the pre 2000 period as the base period the soil characteristics i e percentages of sand silt clay and organic carbon content are obtained from harmonized world soil database hwsd version 1 2 with 30 arcs spatial resolution 900 m available at the food and agriculture organization of the united nations the dem of the study area with a 30 m spatial resolution is obtained shuttle radar topography mission srtm it is used in the computation of topographic parameters such as slope length and steepness factor the calculation of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi map and the supervised classification of land use land cover lulc map are carried out using landsat 5 satellite imageries for the years 1985 1990 and 2010 and landsat 8 imagery for the year 2015 image processing is carried out by google earth engine gee and arcgis version10 3 is used for developing spatial maps of various input variables of the rusle model since prior to the 1990 s landsat imageries did not cover the entire study area and significant changes are seen over a 5 year period following the 1990 s therefore we considered 1990 1995 2010 and 2015 for the calculation of ndvi and for the preparation of lulc map the calculation of median ndvi and supervised classification of lulc for the years 1985 1990 2010 and 2015 is carried out using the gee the sediment yield data for two time frames are collected from the central water commission cwc sediment concentration measuring stations of the upper mahanadi basin extracted from the hydro meteorological water yearbook of cwc the different sediment gauge stations along the upper mahanadi basin are shown in fig 1 2 3 model description the rusle model is used for the assessment of soil erosion it simplifies the complex physical mechanism for the long term rate of soil erosion over an extensive area while retaining the main factors affecting the mechanism for the forest and agricultural watersheds rusle has been extensively employed to evaluate annual average soil erosion through enhanced methods to compute the soil erosion parameters renard et al 1996 it is currently the most known modeling tool for simulating actual soil potential from coarser to finer spatial scales behera et al 2020 according to renard et al 1996 the rusle factors are computed using rainfall lulc topography and soil data after that the dynamics of streamflow and soil erosion can be assessed using a direct correlation between rainfall and runoff this approach is broadly adopted to evaluate the soil loss and therefore its hazard assessment guides in rehabilitating the areas prone to erosion by adopting appropriate management policies biswas and pani 2015 ostovari et al 2017 2 4 rusle model parameterization the rusle model comprises five input factors to compute the mean annual soil erosion in a region the formulation is expressed as 1 a r k ls c p where k indicates the soil erodibility factor ton ha 1mj 1mm 1 r indicates the rainfall erosivity factor mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 ls indicates the topographic factor dimensionless p is the conservation practice factor dimensionless 0 1 c indicates the cover management factor dimensionless 0 1 5 a indicates the mean annual potential soil loss tons ha 1 yr 1 all these factors are discussed one by one 2 4 1 rainfall erosivity factor rainfall erosivity factor r is the potential of rainfall to separate the soil particles from the soil layer it is the measure of the erosive strength of rainfall it depends on the intensity duration and volume of the precipitation and it can be calculated as a specific rainstorm or sequence of rainstorms to calculate erosivity cumulatively the most common type of erosion in barren land is splash erosion the value of r factor is computed from eq 2 it was originally developed by wischmeier and smith 1978 to establish the relation between rainfall depth and rainfall erosivity and afterward amended by arnoldus 1980 for the inclusion of monthly rainfall dynamics 2 r i 1 12 1 735 10 1 5 log p i 2 p 0 08188 where p is the average annual rainfall magnitude mm p i is the rainfall of i th month mm r is an average rainfall erosivity factor mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 2 4 2 soil erodibility factor soil erodibility factor k is the vulnerability of the top layer of soil to erosion sediment transport capacity and runoff rates under standard conditions it is measured as the soil loss on a 22 13 m long plot with 9 slope kept in constant fallow tilled along the slope of a hill weesies et al 1998 the k factor value is calculated by adopting the eq 3 given by wischmeier and smith 1978 3 k 1 2917 2 1 10 4 m 1 14 12 om 3 25 s 2 2 5 ρ 3 100 where om refers to the of organic matter content in the soil s indicates the value corresponding to structural classes 1 for very fine granular 2 for fine granular 3 for medium or coarse granular and 4 for blocky platy or massive structure ρ indicates the value corresponding to the permeability class 1 for rapid 2 for moderate to rapid 3 for moderate 4 for slow to moderate 5 for slow and 6 for very slow permeability rate and m is a function of soil primary particle size fraction given by m of silt of very fine sand x 100 of clay the study area has three types of soil with different soil characteristics as used in eq 3 2 4 3 topographic factor the slope length and steepness collectively called the topographic factor ls is the linear distance joining the beginning of the overland flow and the point where slope length lowers for the deposition process the equation for evaluating the ls factor in the rusle model considers rill erosion unlike the usle model in specific the moving process of the erosion mechanism is controlled mainly by the topographical factor the ls factor is computed from eq 4 mitasova and mitas 2001 4 ls fa cs 22 13 0 4 sin θ 0 0896 1 3 where fa is the flow accumulation and cs is the cell size of the dem data in our case 30 m θ is the slope angle of the drainage basin in degrees 2 4 4 cover management factor the cover management factor c is the ratio of soil loss from cultivated land to relative soil loss from continuous clean tilled fallow land in specific conditions several researchers allocated the c factor on the basis of lulc however the changes in vegetation cover and density were not included in these analyses therefore in this analysis normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is used to consider variability between scrubland and forests to calculate the ndvi for every pixel in the study area eq 5 is used jena et al 2018 5 ndvi nir red nir red where nir and red are the measures of spectral reflectance obtained in the near infrared and visible spectrum respectively the value of ndvi lies between 1 and 1 within the near infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum the photosynthetically active vegetation exhibits high reflectivity as compared to the red portion therefore very high values of ndvi are observed for active photosynthesis vegetation the c factor is computed from eq 6 durigon et al 2014 6 c e 2 ndvi 1 ndvi 2 4 5 support practice factor the support practice p is the ratio between soil loss through a particular management practice to the relative loss with up and downslope plowing renard et al 1996 the p factor in the current study is allocated in accordance with the management practices for different lulc as represented in table s1 in supplementary material the value varies between 0 and 1 with the highest value for land without management practice and the lowest value for land with management practices 2 5 climate change effect analysis the most severe environmental alteration is expected as a consequence of climate change perović et al 2019 the soil erosion quantification is subject to vary in the perspective of climate change in response to changes in rainfall vegetation indices and lulc over time periods the magnitude and intensity of rainfall directly affect the rusle model as a result a modified evaluation of the rainfall erosivity r factor for different time periods is inevitable under the climate change aspect in this regard the r factors for two time periods 1981 2000 and 2001 2019 are determined the most significant connection among the soil soil moisture and the atmosphere is the vegetation chuai et al 2013 seasonal as well as annual climate variations affect natural vegetation bagherzadeh et al 2020 zhang et al 2011 cui and shi 2010 in this study the ndvi for the years 1990 and 1995 are calculated and the spatial map for both years are averaged using raster calculator in the arcgis environment to prepare a spatially distributed ndvi map for the time frame 1981 2000 similarly the spatially distributed ndvi map for the years 2010 and 2015 are averaged to account for soil loss estimation for the period of 2001 2019 change in land productivity that contributes to lulc change is also a crucial aspect to assess soil erosion land use planning and ecological growth need a thorough knowledge of the spatiotemporal variation of soil erosion on account of lulc change keesstra et al 2016 the spatially distributed lulc map for both the time periods viz 1981 2000 and 2001 2019 are computed by calculating the average of the spatially distributed lulc map of 1990 and 1995 for the time period 1981 2000 and the lulc maps of 2010 and 2015 are used to prepare the lulc map for the time frame 2001 2019 the average map is prepared using the raster calculator in the arcgis environment furthermore the topographic factor soil type and soil texture are subject to very slow alterations over the years behera et al 2020 thus the soil erodibility factor k a function of soil type and the topographic factor ls a function of slope length and steepness are considered as constant in this study in this study three analyses are performed keeping the k factor and ls factor as constant in all the analyses to delineate the effects of other factors related to climate and terrestrial conditions on soil erosion firstly the coupled effects of three changing factors viz the r factor c factor and p factor on erosion rate are observed by updating all the three factors for the time periods of analysis pre and post 2000 subsequently the individual effects of change in rainfall and lulc over time are analyzed for that in the second analysis the influence of lulc variations on erosion rate is assessed by considering 1981 2000 as the control period varying c and p factors and assuming the r factor as constant throughout the time in the last analysis the influence of changing rainfall on erosion is assessed by taking the p factor as constant over time while the c factor and r factor are varied by anticipating 1981 2000 as the control period using the methodology discussed for calculating c factor r factor and p factor different maps are prepared for both time periods of 1981 2000 and 2001 2019 furthermore these factors are multiplied with k factor and ls factor in developing a potential soil erosion map intended for respective time periods the operational flow chart of the overall methodological approach is shown in fig 2 2 6 validation using sediment yield data when soil erodes a portion of it is moved through the channel section and makes a significant contribution to sediment yield whereas the remaining portion is stored in the channel multiple soil erosion and sedimentation studies have been conducted to analyze the relationship between soil loss inside a drainage basin and sediment yield sy at the outlet point the sediment delivery ratio sdr a lumped concept can be used to calculate the sy the sdr is defined as the ratio of sediment yield calculated at a channel point to gross highlands soil erosion including sheet rill gully and channel erosion however the rusle only estimates rill and inter rill or sheet erosion which is regarded as a significant contributing factor to gross erosion this concept of sdr takes into account a number of processes that occur throughout on site soil erosion and the sediment yield at the outlet van rompaey et al 2001 a variety of factors can influence sdr including channel density sediment source proximity to the mainstream texture basin area length slope rainfall runoff factors and land use land cover the sdr of a watershed with steep slopes is greater than that of a watershed with flat and broad valleys in general the lesser the sdr the greater the area size several sdr models have been developed and utilized to determine sy as tabulated in table s5 in supplementary material however the selection of the best sdr model for a certain basin is cumbersome owing to the lack of studies involving this technique using observational data the drainage area method as given in eq 7 is the most commonly and widely used method for estimating sdr de vente et al 2007 7 sdr a d b where d is the drainage basin area in km2 and a and b are correction factors related to the physical characteristics of the basin the adjustment b variable has a negative sign as it signifies that with an increase in the basin area the sdr decreases the various sdr models extensively used in the literature are provided in table s2 in supplementary material in this study we have used observed sediment yield values obtained from cwc s sediment concentration measuring stations in the study basin the average sy data is collected from 1981 to 2019 the average sy for the periods is calculated for twelve sub basins of the study basin namely andhiyarkore bamnidih baronda basantpur ghatora jondhra kotni manendragarh rajim rampur seorinarayan and simga having sediment gauging station fig 1 for the periods 1981 2000 and 2001 2019 using these data the parameters in eq 7 are calibrated for the study basin as discussed later in results and discussion section finally the estimated sediment yield sy est is evaluated as follows 8 sy est sdr gsl where gsl is the gross soil loss and both sy est and gsl are in tons yr 1 3 results and discussion the spatial variation of mean annual precipitation for two successive periods 1981 2000 and 2001 2019 is shown in fig s1a and fig s2b respectively in supplementary material it is observed that average rainfall per year differs from 915 mm to 1623 mm with the maximum value confined to the northern part of the basin during the years 1981 2000 and from 960 mm to 1414 mm with the maximum value found in the southern and most of the northern areas of the basin during 2001 2019 the rainfall erosivity factor r as shown in fig s1c and s1d in supplementary material ranges between 2029 and 8168 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 during 1981 2000 and from 40 to 4609 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 during 2001 2019 it is noticed that the northwestern part of the basin such as the kawardha and mungeli districts having low r factor during 1981 2000 is found to have a slight increase in r factor during 2001 2019 on the other hand the central part of the basin such as bemetara baloda bazar raipur and mahasmund is found to have more drastic increase in r factor during 2001 2019 the southeastern part of the basin spanning over the gariaband and kanker districts having medium r factor during 1981 2000 exhibits more r factor during 2001 2019 similarly the southern part of the basin balod dhamatari and durg districts is characterized by medium r factor during 1981 2000 that reduces during 2001 2019 the rest of the basin area is noticed to have more or less steady r factor for the considered time periods it is observed that the higher r factor is spatially distributed over northern and southwestern regions during 1981 2000 and over northern and eastern parts during 2001 2019 this may be the result of erratic rainfall across the study area and the similar phenomena were also reported for huaihe river basin china by wei et al 2022 and yangtze river basin china by huang et al 2013 peng et al 2022 suggested that the rise in rainfall intensity would result in higher erosion rates soil erodibility is a measurement of a soil s cohesive character which is governed by the physical and chemical characteristics of soil and thus influencing its erodibility potential the spatially distributed k factor map is illustrated in fig s2a in supplementary material the k factor varies as 0 043 tons h mj 1 mm 1 for clay soil 0 065 ton h mj 1 mm 1 for loam soil 0 069 ton h mj 1 mm 1 for sandy clay loam soil and 0 075 ton h mj 1 mm 1 for sandy loam soil it is noticed that a large part of the basin is covered by sandy loam soil with a maximum k factor value lower k values are found for clay soil covering the least part i e 0 029 of the study area in clay soil the higher percentage of clay than sand has a more cohesive nature that binds the soil particles thus reducing its susceptibility to erosion the topographic factor defines the impact of slope steepness s and slope length l factors on soil erosion the results represented in fig s2b in supplementary material shows that 94 25 of the watershed has ls value 5 indicating a less varied topography of the basin correspondingly 3 09 2 09 0 37 0 07 and 0 09 of the basin have ls value in the range of 5 10 10 25 25 50 50 75 and 75 respectively table s2 in supplementary material ndvi is calculated to measure the c factor the ndvi gives more detail regarding the density and condition of the vegetation cover it better represents the spatial variation of the factor c for the two successive years as illustrated in fig s3 in supplementary material low c factor values are associated with dense forests while high values are associated with fallow lands and crop fields as observed from the results the percentage of area covered under each class of c factor for two successive periods is compared in table s3 in supplementary material the c factor value ranging from 0 3 to 0 5 accounted for 88 39 of the study area during 1981 2000 that increased to 89 02 during 2001 2019 as soil surfaces are considered vulnerable to bare soil and pastureland a higher value of the c factor indicates more susceptibility to soil erosion dash et al 2021 therefore the higher range for the c factor of 0 7 1 implies increased soil erosion susceptibility since they are assessed as exposed soil surfaces it is depicted that an insignificant rise in the area coverage made up 0 001 1981 2000 to 0 007 2001 2019 for the c factor value of 0 7 1 however a decline is elucidated for the area coverage for the c factor value of 0 0 1 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 from 1981 to 2000 2000 2019 the c factor value of 0 1 0 3 is found to be decreased for some northwestern southwestern and central parts of the basin covering the districts such as rajnandgaon kawardha bemetara and bilaspur whereas it is found to be increased in the northeastern southeastern and southern parts of the basin including districts like korba dhamatari gariaband and mahasmund during 2001 2019 the decline in c factor values in some parts of the area over the years suggests a decrement in soil erosion rate the p factor denotes the decreased soil erosion threat caused by supportive management structures implemented in a particular area it s value is allocated based on various lulc classes the average of the lulc map for the years 1990 and 1995 fig s4a in supplementary material is considered to evaluate the p factor for the time period of 1981 2000 fig s4c in supplementary material likewise the average of the lulc map for the years 2010 and 2015 fig s4b in supplementary material is considered to evaluate the p factor for the time period of 2001 2019 fig s4d in supplementary material it is found that the maximum part of the basin is covered by agricultural cropland table s4 in supplementary material depicts the areal distribution for the lulc over two successive periods it is observed that there is a decline in forest cover 25 5 22 93 and fallow land 28 95 22 22 from 1981 to 2000 2001 2019 however there is an increase in water bodies 0 55 0 96 agricultural cropland 35 84 39 05 built up 1 38 4 94 and barren land 7 78 9 9 over the years this shows that most of the study area is affected by climate change the p factor value ranges from 0 to 1 the maximum value for p factor in 1981 2000 is found to be surrounding some parts of the northern southern and eastern basin area koriya manendragarh kanker mahasamund and baloda bazar that has been decreased during 2001 2019 however the area of the basin covering the northwestern part of the basin kawardha and mungeli shows an increase in p factor value for the year 2001 2019 than in 1980 2000 considering the outcomes of all the rusle factors for both the time periods i e 1981 2000 and 2001 2019 three further analyses are carried out the factors so prepared in raster map form are multiplied in the raster calculator in arcgis 10 3 system to obtain spatially distributed erosion map the spatially distributed maps of soil erosion are reclassified into eight erosion classes by following the consumer specified classification criterion the erosion classes along with the percentage of areal coverage for all three analyses are provided in table 1 the average annual potential soil erosion varying pixel wise across the upper mahanadi basin for all three analyses are depicted in fig s5 in supplementary material overall in all three analyses the erosion rate including the maximum mean and total erosion rate are observed to be reduced during 2001 2019 than during 1981 2000 period as depicted in table 2 in the first analysis the average annual soil erosion is estimated concerning the coupled effect of factors such as conservation practice p factor crop management c factor and rainfall erosivity r factor keeping other factors namely topographic ls factor and erodibility k factor constant over the years from the study it is found that the mean soil erosion rate varies as 37 02 ton ha 1 yr 1 in 1981 2000 and 31 89 ton ha 1 yr 1 in 2001 2019 with a decrement of maximum rate from 2 5 105 ton ha 1 yr 1 1981 2000 to 1 5 105 ton ha 1 yr 1 2001 2019 the total erosion rate is about 217 35 million ton yr 1 1981 2000 and 187 23 million ton yr 1 2001 2019 the maximum erosion rate is decreased by 40 whereas the total and mean erosion rate is decreased by and 13 85 with respect to 1981 2000 it is observed that there is a gradual decline in soil erosion seen in the northern and eastern parts of the basin over the years the region with the greatest percentage drop is found to be laid out with vegetation with a decline in rainfall over the years and are having reduced slope the maximum soil erosion for both the time periods is found at the northern part of the basin i e at chirimiri the largest city and a hill station with steep slopes of the manendragarh district of chhattisgarh fig s5 in supplementary material furthermore habtu and jayappa 2022 confirmed that the north and northeastern sections of their study region with hilly and mountainous topography have a moderate to extremely severe erosion vulnerability due to steep slopes and high rainfall from the reclassified erosion map it is found that the area under the negligible erosion group 5 10 tons ha 1 yr 1 covers the maximum part of the basin while the least area is under severe erosion for both time periods nonetheless it covers 67 4 of the area during 1981 2000 which climbs up to 71 5 during 2001 2019 this shows that it is highly likely for those places to face increased soil erosion hazards in the future however the rest of the reclassified erosion rates table 5 are observed to decline over the years for that basin area this is attributed to the increasing spatial coverage of the study region as corroborated by other works allafta and opp 2022 habtu and jayappa 2022 besides this could be due to change in rainfall change in crop management practices and lulc over the periods since rainfall acts as a vital contributor to the soil erosion processes climate change is likely to affect soil erosion through changes in rainfall mondal et al 2015 soil erosion may be increased or decreased as a result of lulc changes changes in lulc i e the spread of cultivated area lead to increased soil erosion which is expected to intensify with increased precipitation belay and mengistu 2021 the areal extent in terms of percentage for the change in erosion rate for the three analyses are illustrated in table 3 the change in erosion rate along with the areal coverage for each categorized change rate for all three analyses is shown in fig 3 for the first analysis almost 83 area of the study region exhibits a reduced change in the erosion rate during 2001 2019 as compared to the past time frame i e 1981 2000 nearly 19 area shows a negative change in erosion rate mostly across the northern and southern parts wherein for 64 of the entire study area the reduction lies in the range of 5 0 tons ha 1 yr 1 it is found that the r and c factor declines during 2001 2019 prior to 1981 2000 moreover during 2001 2019 it is observed that there are more built up areas and water bodies less fallow land and forest areas influencing the p factor all these factors r c p together represent the higher decline in erosion rate during 2001 2019 than 1981 2000 the rainfall erosivity factor r is an important factor that results in soil erosion wei et al 2022 he et al 2022 and kabolizadeh et al 2022 showed that the potential of erosion decreases along with the value of rainfall erosivity r factor an effective indicator of soil erosion is vegetation cover it can gradually reduce overall soil loss by protecting the topsoil from the direct effects of precipitation novara et al 2019 there has been an increase in vegetation cover during 2001 2019 than 1981 2000 that result in a decrease in the c factor and thus the erosion rate other studies kavian et al 2019 almohamad 2020 macedo et al 2021 kabolizadeh et al 2022 have made reference to this and the findings of this study are similar with those for this study the sdr approach is used for validating the outcomes of this research our findings revealed that sy levels are overestimated the substantial inaccuracies could be due to observations that were made with probable uncertainty and or model development uncertainty our findings regarding overestimation of sediment yield quite resembled to the study done on sediment yield modelling in tawi river of jammu region india by rawat et al 2022 due to the great complexity of the sediment delivery mechanism and the necessity to examine the interrelationship between their intervenient components to adapt the equation it is difficult to develop a universal equation to estimate the sdr in a basin walling 1983 on that account we adjusted sdr equation by vanoni 1975 accordingly to minimize the disparity between the estimated and observed sediment yield sy obs and sy est for our study area the twelve sub basins are divided into two thirds for calibration and one third for validation purposes thus 3 fold cross validation is used to obtain a more accurate and dependable coefficient of sdr for the study basin the value of a from eq 7 is optimized considering a wide range of values from 0 05 to 0 5 the optimum value of a is selected based on the least rmse between sy obs and sy est and a reasonable difference between calibration and validation error across the folds and two time periods results of 3 fold cross validation reveal that eq 9 is the best suited for predicting sdr for the study basin d in km 2 9 sdr 0 1 d 0 125 the plot between the observed and predicted sediment yield data for both the time periods is represented in fig 4 the twelve sediment gauge stations along with their respective sdr sy obs and sy est for both 1981 2000 and 2001 2019 time periods are represented in table 4 overall it is observed that the gross soil erosion and the sediment yield over the basin reduces in 2001 2019 as compared to 1981 2000 a spearman s rank correlation analysis was performed for average annual rainfall and average annual soil erosion for both period of datasets during 1981 2000 soil erosion and rainfall were strongly positively correlated r 0 525 p 0 01 while during the period 2001 2019 soil erosion and rainfall were moderately correlated r 0 160 p 0 01 the preliminary correlation analysis suggests that the rainfall have a positive impact on the soil loss while more detailed analysis is required to explore the full mechanism since soil loss depends on the duration of rainfall and more importantly rainfall intensity the effect of rainfall frequency and intensity can show more positive correlation with erosion a similar type of study on the comparison of rainfall and erosion has been done earlier by various researchers martínez mena et al 2020 evaluated the effects of various sustainable management practices on erosion in two rainfed systems in spain they found that the spearman s correlation between rainfall erosivity and soil erosion was found to be 0 52 with p 0 01 and they found that erosive responses were correlated much more closely with the rainfall intensity than with the rainfall depth huang et al 2020 found that spearman s rank correlation analysis showed actual soil loss related to annual rainfall positively strong correlation was r 0 7 observed in more than 50 area and were statistically significant at 95 confidence level the second analysis shows the impact of variation in lulc p factor on erosion rate the maximum mean and total erosion rate are found to be 1 55 105 tons ha 1 yr 1 32 27 tons ha 1 yr 1 and 189 46 million tons yr 1 respectively from the reclassified erosion map as shown in fig s5 in supplementary material it is found that the area under each erosion class is nearly the same as in the case of the first analysis conducted the analysis shows that while c and p factor are changed keeping r factor constant the maximum erosion rate is found to be almost the same as the erosion rate considering all the factors changing overtime in the first analysis the mean erosion rate and total erosion rate are slightly increased in the second analysis 32 27 tons ha yr and 189 46 tons ha yr respectively with respect to the first analysis 31 89 tons ha yr and 187 23 tons ha yr respectively around 82 23 of the study region shows a decline in erosion rate with time as illustrated in fig 3 almost 17 06 of the study area indicates a decrease in erosion rate particularly in the north and southern parts with 65 17 of the study area experiencing a drop in the range of 5 0 tons ha 1 yr 1 there is a little variation in erosion rate when coupled effects of all the changing factors are compared with the constant rainfall factor on the erosion rate over the years this explains that change in rainfall when combined with lulc and ndvi variations gives quite a similar result when change in rainfall is considered fixed along with changing lulc and ndvi variations it can be seen from fig s4a and s4b in supplementary material that with varying decades there is a shift toward built up land resulting in less or the same infiltration rate lulc constituted of more establishments towards 2001 2019 have less p factor value that contributes towards declined erosion rate in the study area there seems to have a positive correlation between the p factor value and the erosion rate this outcome is in line with findings from other studies wijesundara et al 2018 naqvi et al 2013 prasannakumar et al 2012 jena et al 2018 the third analysis shows the impact of changing rainfall on erosion rate in the third analysis the maximum mean and total erosion rate are found to be 1 90 105 tons ha 1 yr 1 35 23 tons ha 1 yr 1 206 83 million tons yr 1 over here distinguished change is observed in almost all categorized erosion ranges most remarkably the negligible erosion group 5 10 tons ha 1 yr 1 covering around 67 48 of the study region is found to be reduced in terms of the areal extent with respect to the first two analyses this explains that while lulc p factor is considered to be constant over the years and r factor along with c factor is changed the erosion rate increases this current analysis shows that the change in rainfall have more influence on erosion rate rather than other factors the change in rainfall and soil loss have a strong correlation between them a significant increase in rainfall amount is typically followed by the rise in soil erosion nigam et al 2017 while there is a mixed effect of both increase and decrease in erosion rate along with time towards the northern and southern part of the study region in the first and second analysis there is an inconsiderable increase in erosion rate towards northern and southern parts of the study area during 2001 2019 in the third analysis while the first and second analyses show a blended effect of both increase and decrease in erosion rate towards the northern and southern parts of the study region the third analysis shows an insignificant increase in erosion rate toward the northern and southern parts of the study region from 2001 to 2019 with respect to 1981 2000 in the third analysis there is a rise in erosion rate with very scanty declines in the middle part of the research area in contrast to the diverse results in the first and second analyses the change in erosion rate is almost the same for the first two analyses for each categorized class in contrast in the third analysis the change in erosion rate is considerably varying from the rest analysis as shown in table 3 spatial variation of erosivity is noticed in all the analyses and the maximum soil detachment has occurred due to varying rainfall amount the erosion rate is found to be directly proportional to the rainfall depth in the majority of locations this finding is also supported by previous studies that established soil erosion is considerably influenced due to differences in rainfall erosivity zhang liu 2005 nearing et al 2004 shiono et al 2013 increased precipitation intensity is expected to result in increased soil degradation which has also been concluded by zhang et al 2011 this is observed that the change in mean rainfall amount as reflected in r factor affects the erosion rate more than the lulc change similarly de hipt et al 2019 belay and mengistu 2021 and dos santos et al 2021 found that the climate change has a larger impact on erosion than lulc as anticipated this study shows that the climate change in terms of change in rainfall and lulc significantly increases spatial variation and becomes the major contributing factor to change in soil erosion rate over the study area despite the major findings gleaned from this study it is realized that higher spatial resolution satellite data can shed more light on the results of this research this limitation can be addressed in future studies by collecting sentinel imageries for the assessment besides the use of only one erosion model is a constraint to this study the use of multi model approaches could enhance understanding of uncertainty resulting from model choice 4 conclusions the effect of climate change on soil erosion using gis integrated rusle model is investigated in a rainfed basin through analyzing the change in rainfall and lulc the maximum mean and total erosion rates for all the analyses during 2001 2019 were less than during 1981 2000 the maximum erosion rate decreased by 40 whereas the total and mean erosion rates reduced by 13 85 for 1981 2000 when all the factors r c p were varied over the years whereas with r constant and varying p and c factors it was observed that there was a 40 38 decrease in maximum erosion rate and 12 83 decrease in total and mean erosion rate with respect to 1981 2000 similarly by varying r and c factor and with p factor as constant it was observed that there was a 26 92 decrease in maximum erosion rate and 4 84 decrease in mean and total erosion rate it was also noticed that the erosion class from 5 to 10 ton ha 1 yr 1 covers 67 4 of the study area during 1981 2000 which elevates to 71 5 71 59 and 67 48 during 2001 2019 in the first second and third analyses respectively thus it was not the total amount of erosion but the spatial extent of the zone that increased due to changes in the climate the model yielded acceptable sdr and sy estimates and it can be used to predict sy in similar rain fed basins with sparse data and ungauged basins besides the identified suitable locations and the anticipated changes in the soil erosion risk will help administrators consider soil management measures in erosion prone sites over the years in addition the proposed methods for evaluating the risks of soil loss in a climate change context can be widely applied at the basin scale by performing basin specific calibration and validation credit authorship contribution statement sushree sangita dash methodology formal analysis writing original draft preparation rajib maity

7637,study region pearl river basin prb has a tropical to subtropical climate in china study focus an unprecedented extreme flood broke out in prb during 2014 2016 super el niño period we construct the water storage deficit index wsdi to quantify this extreme flood event the principal component analysis approach is used to analyze the wsdi in prb and el niño southern oscillation enso and the sea surface temperature sst anomaly in the tropical indian ocean tios to identify the influence factors furthermore the underlying influence mechanisms are explored via correlation analysis new hydrological insights for the region the severity of the extreme flood event was 483 11 km3 with a maximum surplus of terrestrial water storage in february 2016 76 11 km3 the extreme flood was mainly influenced by the super el niño and enhanced by tios the wsdi is significantly correlated with enso and tios for the first and second principal components the correlation coefficients are 0 90 and 0 41 for enso after a 3 month lag and 0 86 and 0 66 for tios after a 2 month lag respectively the super el niño favored the extreme flood event by intensifying the anticyclones over the south china sea the philippine sea and the bay of bengal further promoting the attenuation of the south china sea monsoon and the westward extension of west pacific subtropical high inducing more moisture transport towards prb graphical abstract ga1 keywords grace extreme flood super el niño principal component analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction extreme weather events like floods droughts windstorms heatwaves and high temperatures occur more frequently as a result of global warming having a considerable impact on both the global and regional hydrological process alexander et al 2013 harder et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 ummenhofer et al 2017 yang et al 2021 the frequency and intensification of flash droughts will significantly increase because of the growing greenhouse gas concentrations during the middle and end of this century especially in southern china yuan et al 2019 the onset speed and frequency of extreme droughts such as the terrible flash drought in southeastern china in the summer of 2020 will increase by 85 and 49 wang and yuan 2022 the pearl river basin prb is located in the southeastern coastal region of china and is essential to the economic growth of china weng 2007 zhang et al 2009 zhang et al 2022a 2022b however it s vulnerable to extreme floods and droughts due to the position of tropical and subtropical climate zones huang et al 2021 xiao et al 2016 xu et al 2019 two prolonged droughts and five major floods have occurred over prb during the previous twenty years zhang et al 2019 huang et al 2021 xiao et al 2016 which performs disastrous influences on agriculture ecosystems and economic development in prb leichenko et al 2014 li et al 2016 dai et al 2020 therefore analyzing the characteristics and driving factors of droughts and floods over prb can provide the scientific basis for disaster prevention and water resource utilization drought and flood events are generally quantified with various drought indices byun et al 1999 pandey et al 2008 deo et al 2017 huang et al 2021 at present numerous hydro meteorological drought indices are available zargar et al 2011 meresa et al 2016 javadinejad et al 2020 such as the standardized streamflow index ssi shukla and wood 2008 the standardized precipitation index spi mckee 1993 and the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei beguería et al 2010 however these traditional drought indices only consider one or several hydrometeorological elements which is difficult to completely reflect the actual conditions of droughts or floods yi and wen 2016 nigatu et al 2021 and the required hydrometeorological variables and calculation methods of these indices are various which leads to the differences in monitoring droughts and floods cao et al 2015 yu et al 2019 furthermore the required hydrometeorological variables of these indices generally are obtained from in situ measurements or hydrological models sun et al 2018 the measurements are limited by the environmental dependence and sparse spatial distribution of gauging stations especially for scarcely regional streamflow stations the spatial characteristics of runoff changes are few studied creutzfeldt et al 2012 and the anthropogenic factors are usually ignored in hydrological models qi et al 2020 the observations from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace provide a unique opportunity to estimate global terrestrial water storage tws change with consistent data quality and spatial resolution tapley et al 2004 which reflects the total deficit or surplus of different hydrological components including groundwater storage surface water soil moisture and snow and combined effects of natural factors and human activities sun et al 2018 compensating the flaws of traditional hydro meteorological drought indices therefore the grace based drought indices are employed by numerous scientists for drought and flood identification yi and wen 2016 cao et al 2015 thomas et al 2014 sun et al 2018 yu et al 2019 for example the hydrological drought index ghdi from grace derived tws was used for drought monitoring in arid northwestern china and the total storage deficit index tsdi from grace based tws was utilized for drought identification in the continental united states respectively yi and wen 2016 cao et al 2015 besides thomas et al 2014 designed the water storage deficit index wsdi using tws anomalies relative to the monthly average nigatu et al 2021 evaluated eight major floods and ten droughts in the nile river basin based on wsdi among them the wsdi is characterized as dimensionless and seasonless sun et al 2018 yu et al 2019 and recommended for further application by liu et al 2020 and will be used in this study for flood evaluation previous studies have demonstrated the impacts of el niño southern oscillation enso on different regional climate changes salau et al 2012 kim et al 2011 yeh et al 2018 enso is a well known climate fluctuation factor concerning the sea surface temperature sst anomaly in tropical pacific that affects global precipitation and tws changes fig 1 chen et al 2020a b huang et al 2021 its warm period is known as el niño while its cold period is called la niña yao et al 2016 bookhagen and strecker 2010 combined grace and hydro meteorology data to analyze the tws changes in the amazon basin and its connection with enso events yu et al 2020 showed the tws changes in the three parallel rivers of the southeastern tibetan plateau from 2002 to 2016 lagged behind the enso events by 2 72 months the relationships between tws changes in the yangtze river basin and enso events have also been extensively researched xu et al 2005 yin et al 2009 ouyang et al 2014 furthermore the climate changes of prb significantly respond to enso events due to its proximity to the pacific ocean huang et al 2021 wu et al 2020 enso can affect the locations and intensities of western pacific anomalous anticyclone western pacific subtropical high south asian monsoon and east asian monsoon chen et al 2013 2020a b huang et al 2021 resulting in anomalous water vapor transporting to prb luo et al 2016 meanwhile the tropical indian ocean sst tios fig 1 rises under the el niño conditions generating kelvin waves which triggers the anticyclonic circulation and tropospheric lower anomalous easterly wind anomalies over the bay of bengal further regulating the water vapor transported towards prb klein et al 1999 lau et al 2000 ma et al 2018 khan et al 2021 western pacific subtropical high moves southward during the el niño periods thus inducing flood events over prb while western pacific subtropical high moves northward and prb is vulnerable to droughts during the la niña periods chen et al 2020a b luo et al 2016 the precipitation across prb is proportional to enso in autumn and winter while inversely proportional in spring ouyang et al 2014 huang et al 2016 and is more susceptible to enso in dry periods from october to march than in wet periods from april to september wu et al 2020 additionally enso and the variations of drought and flood in prb have consistent interannual periodic signals ranging from 32 to 62 months wu et al 2020 the el niño from 2014 to 2016 is regarded as one of three historic super events 1982 1983 1997 1998 and 2014 2016 and stronger than the first two events ma et al 2018 zhai et al 2016 disastrous weather occurred in response to the super el niño event from 2014 to 2016 around the world li and min 2016 kogan and guo 2017 kolusu et al 2019 for example the super el niño enhanced the global temperature that reached its warmest in 2015 after 1900 ma et al 2018 zhai et al 2016 the precipitation significantly increased over australia and southeast china but seriously decreased in southern africa northeast china and northwest china during this severe el niño event van rensch et al 2019 ma et al 2018 the water deficit in april 2015 reached 36 9 in the united states noaa 2016 extreme rainfall events struck the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in june july 2016 and agreed with the contemporary super el niño ranking as the most serious rainfall since 1951 yuan et al 2018 meanwhile an unprecedented extreme flood broke out over prb and its duration severity spatial coverage and mechanisms remain unexplored therefore this paper will study this extreme flood event over prb and its features based on grace based wsdi and investigate the relationships with super el niño by using the pca approach the structure of this paper is as follows section 2 introduces the study region and data source section 3 describes the investigated methods section 4 firstly explores the reliability of wsdi and the features of the extreme flood event over prb then investigates the long term impacts of enso and tios on wsdi and specific impacts on the extreme flood event and the underlying influence mechanisms section 5 presents the discussion and section 6 provides the conclusions 2 study area and data 2 1 study area prb is situated in southeastern china and adjacent to the south china sea and the tropical pacific fig 1 102 14 115 53 e 21 31 26 49 n it s the third largest drainage basin area in china prb originates from the yun gui plateau flowing eastward through six provinces yunnan province guizhou province hunan province jiangxi province guangxi province and guangdong province and finally into the south china sea it comprises the west river mainly including nanpan river hongshui river liu river and yu river the north river and the east river huang et al 2021 zhang et al 2009 prb is located in a tropical and subtropical climate zone with an annual mean temperature ranging from 14 to 22 c annual average precipitation spanning from 1200 to 2000 mm and relative humidity varying from 71 to 80 liu et al 2012 huang et al 2021 the precipitation is spatially uneven across prb and the eastern region is more plentiful than the western region east asian monsoon including western north pacific monsoon and south china sea monsoon and south asian monsoon including indian monsoon dominate the seasonal precipitation over prb which accounts for 4 5 of total annual precipitation during wet periods and decreases significantly during dry periods resulting in frequent floods and droughts huang et al 2021

since the 20 missing months in the csr rl06 mascon products are not continual during 2002 2016 the cubic spline interpolation approach which can ensure interpolation accuracy as shown in numerous research chen et al 2020a b feng et al 2022 huang et al 2021 is used to interpolate the missing data 2 3 hydrometeorological data enso is identified with the sst anomaly in the tropical central eastern pacific 170 e 120 w 5 s 5 n chen et al 2020a b hanley et al 2003 khan et al 2021 and tios is denoted as the sst anomaly in the tropical indian ocean 40 110 e 20 s 20 n yuan et al 2012 the monthly sst spatial resolution of 2 2 data from noaa extended reconstructed version 5 is adopted in this study the outgoing longwave radiation olr anomaly spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 is obtained from ncar noaa institution and the negative olr means an intensive atmospheric activity and vice versa li and min 2016 additionally we have downloaded the series of three parameters of western pacific subtropical high i e strength west ridge point and ridge line from the national climate center of china meteorological administration ncc cma the negative west ridge point means a westward extension of the western pacific subtropical high and vice versa and the positive ridge line denotes a northward movement of the western pacific subtropical high and vice versa liu et al 2012 the monthly multi level wind field and sea level pressure slp with a spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 are acquired from ncep ncar reanalysis center the wind dataset is used to express the asian monsoon including south china sea monsoon indian monsoon and western north pacific monsoon south china sea monsoon is derived from the difference between 850 hpa and 200 hpa zonal wind in the south china sea 0 10 n 100 130 e western north pacific monsoon is regarded as the difference of 850 hpa zonal wind between the northern pacific 20 30 n 110 140 e and the southern pacific 5 15 n 100 130 e indian monsoon is denoted as the difference of 850 hpa zonal wind between the indian peninsula 20 30 n 70 90 e and the indian ocean 5 15 n 40 80 e shi et al 2021 he et al 2020 moreover the mean slp in the pacific region 120 150 n 10 s 10 n is applied to calculate western pacific anomalous anticyclone wang et al 2000 the seasonal cycles of twsa and meteorological data are removed by the method in mishra et al 2021 the monthly precipitation data with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 in prb is derived from ncc cma which is generated from 2472 ground based meteorological stations after a rigorous spline interpolation the in site evapotranspiration is also acquired from ncc cma over 13 gauging stations in prb and the simulated evapotranspiration is from different products including the gleam model derived from remote sensing satellites the clm model provided by nasa and wghm 2 2d model and the detailed descriptions of these products have been presented in zhang et al 2022a 2022b ssi is a popular drought index and is usually expressed as ssi z with the time scale z of 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 months ssi z denotes the accumulated runoff over z consecutive months and the positive values mean wet conditions while the negative values mean dry ones shukla and wood 2008 in this study the in site streamflow to calculate the ssi time series is derived from the outlets of three tributaries in prb i e the shijiao station the boluo station and the gaoyao station are respectively located at the north river the east river and the west river the ssi can be divided into different levels to identify the intensity of flood and drought events shown in table 1 ozkaya et al 2019 zalokar et al 2021 the details about ssi can be found in vicente serrano et al 2014 3 methodology 3 1 construction of water storage deficit index wsdi the residual twsa after deducting the mean value of each month of twsa from april 2002 to december 2016 is used to estimate the water storage deficit wsd and expressed as follows thomas et al 2014 1 wsd i j twsa i j twsa j where twsa i j is the value of the jth month in the ith year and the averaged twsa time series in the jth month represents twsa j the positive negative wsd continuously persisting over three months can be identified as a flood drought event the total severity s t of the tth drought flood event is the multiplication of average deficit surplus m t and duration d t throughout the flood drought period 2 s t m t d t the wsdi is derived from wsd using a zero mean normalization method aiming to better compare with other drought indices thomas et al 2014 sinha et al 2017 3 wsdi i j wsd i j μ σ where μ and σ are the mean and the standardized deviation of the wsd time series based on wsdi the classification for the level of drought and flood is shown in table 1 nie et al 2017 ozkaya et al 2019 nigatu et al 2021 3 2 principal component analysis pca pca is an efficient method to divide spatiotemporal variability into different modes in hydrologic and meteorologic which can reduce the dimensionality of valuables but still retain the most dominant spatiotemporal characteristics of the raw dataset morgan et al 2020 he et al 2020 here we apply pca to decompose the wsdi or enso and tios into empirical orthogonal functions eofs and principal components pcs which correspond to the spatial and temporal variations respectively the wsdi or enso and tios can be denoted with the matrix x with m rows and n columns which respectively represent the numbers of the spatial grids in the study area and the months of the study period the matrix x can be decomposed as preisendorfer 1988 4 x e λ f t where e is an m m normalized orthogonal matrix and its column vectors represent the eofs λ is an m m diagonal matrix it diagonal elements λ i are called singular values f is an n m normalized column orthogonal matrix the product of matrix λ and matrix f t is called the pc matrix p 5 p λ f t the row vectors of the p matrix are the temporal pcs since the singular values are sorted in descending order i e λ 1 λ 2 λ m the first several eofs pcs contain the main contributions and are used to express the spatiotemporal characteristics of wsdi or enso and tios the contribution rate α of the first several eofs pcs is estimated as follows preisendorfer 1988 6 α j 1 k λ j j 1 m λ j 100 where k is the number of selected first pcs the relationship between wsdi and enso can be indicated by the lead lag correlation coefficient r i between the first pcs of wsdi wsdi pc i i 1 k and that of enso enso pc i i 1 k as follows chen et al 2020a b 7 r i t 1 n wsdi pc i t τ wsdi pc i enso pc i t enso pc i t 1 n wsdi pc i t τ wsdi pc i 2 t 1 n enso pc i t enso pc i 2 where wsdi pc i and enso pc i are the mean values of wsdi pc i t and enso pc i t with n epochs the lagged time τ is denoted as the maximum r of the two time series less than 6 months and negative lagged months indicate wsdi lags behind enso while positive lagged months represent wsdi is ahead of enso when the r i reaches a 95 confidence level showing the two time series are significantly correlated additionally the relationship between wsdi and tios can also be identified by the correlation coefficient r i when the first pcs of enso are replaced by that of tios tios pc i i 1 k 3 3 grace based and water balance based tws changes to validate the tws changes based on grace data t w s c g r a c e from csr rl06 mascon products the tws change from the water balance equation t w s c w b is used and expressed as follows 8 t w s c w b t p t r t e t where p t r t and e t respectively represent the precipitation streamflow and evapotranspiration at t month the inflow streamflow is negligible in the prb huang et al 2021 t w s c g r a c e is the twsa difference between two adjacent months long et al 2016 9 t w s c g r a c e t t w s a t t w s a t 1 d t the proximity of t w s c w b and t w s c g r a c e is determined with the following root mean square error rmse 10 r m s e t 1 n t w s c w b t t w s c g r a c e t 2 n where n represents the months of the study period 4 results and analysis 4 1 comparison of wsdi with ssi the latitude weighted time series of wsdi and ssi z with the time scales z of 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 months are shown in fig 2 respectively for these time scales the correlation coefficients at the confidence level of 95 are 0 61 0 81 0 79 0 77 0 73 between wsdi and ssi z indicating that wsdi is well correlated with ssi at these time scales hence wsdi can reflect the long term cumulative effects of droughts and floods the best correlation between wsdi and ssi is at the time scale of 3 months since the wsdi reflects the total deficit surplus of different hydrological components including groundwater storage surface water soil moisture and snow the responsive time of which to droughts or floods is different zhao et al 2017 ran et al 2021 whereas ssi at larger time scales is affected by long term runoff anomalies in the past which will disturb the intensity of droughts or floods in the current month ran et al 2021 chui et al 2021 4 2 features of the 2015 2016 flood event fig 3 illustrates the latitude weighted time series of grace based wsd and its normalized index wsdi spanning from april 2002 to december 2016 there exist six flood events during the study period according to the wsd time series i e the positive wsd continuously lasts over three months which are marked with shaded areas in fig 3a the major surplus periods coincide with the flood conditions that are reported by the water resources bulletin of prb pearl river water conservancy commission 2002 2016 the periods durations peak values severities and intensities of the six floods are summarized in table 2 where the most extensive flood event lasted for 17 months august 2015 to december 2016 and the corresponding severity was 692 62 km3 furthermore the maximum tws repletion over prb was 76 11 km3 in february 2016 and only the 2015 2016 flood event reached an extreme level fig 3b to further investigate the spatial evolution of the 2015 2016 flood event we show the spatial distribution of wsdi in fig 4 the extreme flood mainly assembles spanning from september 2015 to may 2016 hereafter the extreme flood period taking up 70 of total tws surplus throughout the flood period august 2015 to december 2016 the extreme flood originated in september 2015 from the western region spread eastward and expanded to the entire basin in january 2016 and february 2016 then retreated to the eastern region 4 3 influences of enso and tios on wsdi 4 3 1 long term influences the latitude weighted time series of wsdi enso and tios during 2002 2016 are presented in fig 5 a c and the light red shaded areas represent the el niño periods while the light blue shaded areas represent the la niña periods ignoring the weak cold phase from july 2005 to june 2006 combining fig 5a with fig 5b we can find that the conditions of droughts and floods in the prb significantly change due to the phase transformations of enso specifically when the first el niño period april 2002 to february 2007 turned into the first la niña period march 2007 to ma 2009 then into the second el niño period june 2009 to april 2010 and then into the second la niña period ma 2010 to march 2014 and the third el niño period april 2014 to june 2016 the prb transformed from continuous drought to moderate flood then to moderate drought and then to severe drought and extreme flood respectively furthermore the phases of tios in fig 5c are consistent with enso except for the first el niño period from the lead lag correlations between wsdi and enso tios in fig 5 d f we can see that the wsdi is more affected by tios in fig 5 d e while closer to enso in fig 5 f because the strength of enso was relatively weak from april 2002 to april 2010 and the prb is closer to indian ocean while enso dramatically enhanced from may 2010 to june 2016 greatly influencing the variances of droughts and floods over prb the wsdi is significantly correlated with enso and tios at different stages the best is in fig 5f with the correlation coefficient of 0 69 and 0 68 and the worst is in fig 5d with the correlation coefficient of 0 38 and 0 52 indicating enso and tios can chronically influence the variances of floods and droughts over the prb 4 3 2 specific influences on the extreme flood event the strongest el niño event since 1951 which occurred from october 2014 to may 2016 can be divided into five stages namely initial stages october 2014 to january 2015 developing stages february 2015 to may 2015 outbreaking stages june 2015 to september 2015 mature stages october 2015 to january 2016 and decaying stages february 2016 to may 2016 wang 1995 the lagged effect of any stage possibly leads to climate anomalies over prb huang et al 2016 therefore we take the entire stage of the super el niño to analyze its influences on the concurrent extreme flood event the first two eofs and pcs of decomposed wsdi and enso by using the pca approach are presented in fig 6 a d with the shaded areas denoting the extreme flood period and the corresponding lead lag correlation coefficients are shown in fig 6 e f the first two pcs of wsdi respectively account for 80 3 and 11 7 of the total variance furthermore eof1 of wsdi shows a spatial coherence across prb and the corresponding pc1 exhibits a remarkably increasing trend revealing the entire basin becomes wetter which benefits from the outbreaking of the extreme flood event eof2 of wsdi shows the differences between the western and eastern regions of prb and the corresponding pc2 presents a prominently decreasing trend indicating the center of the extreme flood event gradually moves to the eastern region which is in accordance with the spatial variability of wsdi in fig 4 furthermore the first two pcs of enso take up 95 8 of the total variance with 88 5 and 7 3 for pc1 and pc2 respectively after a 3 month delay of enso the pc1 in fig 6c is highly correlated with the correlation coefficient of 0 90 fig 6e while pc2 in fig 6d is moderately correlated with the correlation coefficient of 0 41 fig 6f accordingly the super el niño performed the leading function and triggered the extreme flood event which lagged three months behind the development of super el niño under the mechanisms of atmospheric bridge or indonesian throughflow khan et al 2021 ma et al 2018 tios generally rises in response to the super el niño event and it likely affects the extreme flood event hence the first two pcs of decomposed tios by using the pca approach are also shown in fig 6 c d where the pc1 and pc2 respectively explain 68 8 and 11 1 of the total variance moreover the pcs of wsdi are significantly correlated with that of tios with the correlation coefficients of 0 81 and 0 66 for pc1 and pc2 after a delay of 2 months fig 6 e f therefore tios is 1 month after the super el niño event and enhanced the extreme flood event 4 4 underlying influence mechanisms enso indirectly impacts the climate in prb by influencing the atmospheric circulation over east asia and south asia such as asian monsoon including south china sea monsoon indian monsoon and western north pacific monsoon western pacific subtropical high and western pacific anomalous anticyclone chen et al 2013 2020a b li et al 2016 to feature the influence mechanisms of the super el niño event on the extreme flood event we compute the correlation coefficients between the pc1 of wsdi enso and tios and the possible climate factors including western pacific anomalous anticyclone wpac three parameters of western pacific subtropical high wpsh and asian monsoon and show the results in table 3 we can observe from table 3 that pc1 of wsdi enso and tios is significantly positively correlated with the western pacific anomalous anticyclone and the strength of western pacific subtropical high while negatively correlated with the west ridge point of western pacific subtropical high and south china sea monsoon scsm then we present the significantly correlated climate factors in fig 7 with the shaded area indicating the extreme flood period during the extreme flood period in fig 7 the western pacific anomalous anticyclone and western pacific subtropical high are considerably stronger while the south china sea monsoon is obviously weaker than before and the west ridge point of western pacific subtropical high extends westward hence the super el niño favored the extreme flood event by promoting the intensification of the western pacific anomalous anticyclone and western pacific subtropical high the westward extension of the western pacific subtropical high and the attenuation of the south china sea monsoon fig 8 shows the anomalies of sea surface temperature sst outgoing longwave radiation olr sea level pressure slp and 850 hpa wind during the extreme flood stage respectively the sst increases in the tropical east pacific while decreases in the tropical west pacific fig 8a whereas the olr and slp in fig 8 b c show an opposite spatial distribution to the sst anomaly in fig 8a the positive olr anomaly means a weakened tropospheric activity and the positive slp is always accompanied by anomalous anticyclones li and min 2016 wang et al 2000 therefore the physical mechanisms behind this extreme flood event can be concluded as follows the sst in the tropical east pacific was significantly higher than that in the tropical west pacific which suppressed the tropospheric activity over the tropical west pacific and further reduced the warming functions on the atmosphere over this region li and min 2016 that aroused an atmospheric rossby wave then promoted the westward movement of high pressure area li and min 2016 yang et al 2012 resulting in the anticyclones over the philippine sea and the south china sea meanwhile tios increased under the el niño conditions which can generate kelvin waves triggering the anomalies of lower east wind and the anticyclonic circulation over the bay of bengal ma et al 2018 khan et al 2021 subsequently the anticyclones over the south china sea and the bay of bengal accompanying a weakened south china sea monsoon directly promoted more water vapors toward prb and the anticyclones over the philippine sea and the south china sea enhanced the westward extension of western pacific subtropical high further inducing the intensification of western pacific subtropical high which also favored this extreme flood event 5 discussion 5 1 direct hydrometeorological factors on the extreme flood event the variances of droughts and floods over the prb can be directly influenced by the deficit or surplus of precipitation p evapotranspiration e and runoff r the normalized precipitation and its differences with evapotranspiration and runoff at different time scales are presented in fig 9 the methods of normalization and time scales as ssi vicente serrano et al 2014 and the shaded areas represent the 2015 2016 extreme flood event from fig 9 we can find that the conditions of droughts and floods in the prb change little when removing runoff or evapotranspiration from precipitation indicating precipitation is the most important direct meteorological factor on the variances of droughts and floods over the prb therefore the 2015 2016 extreme flood event identified by wsdi is mainly favored by heavy precipitation rather than the discharges from other basins which is consistent with the results in section 4 4 that the sst dramatically increases in the tropical east pacific and indian ocean indirectly favoring more water vapors toward prb through affecting the atmospheric circulation and then inducing a extreme flood event 5 2 comparison of different grace level 3 products besides the csr mascon products other level 3 grace products from the jet propulsion laboratory jpl watkins et al 2015 and the tongji reggrace2019 solution chen et al 2021 are used to derive the tws changes and compared with those from the water balance equation ground based precipitation and streamflow due to large uncertainty in measuring evapotranspiration we also use another three simulated evapotranspiration products including gleam clm and wghm the correlation coefficient and rmse estimated with the tws changes differences between grace products and the water balance estimates using different evapotranspiration products are presented in table 4 and table 5 respectively the result show csr mascon estimates are closer to the water balance estimates for different evapotranspiration products than the other two grace estimates with the maximum correlation coefficient and minimal rmse and used in this study additionally the correlation coefficients are proximal between grace based tws changes and water balance estimates with different evapotranspiration products excepting for wghm and the rmse is lowest with the averaged values of four evapotranspiration products revealing that considering multiple evapotranspiration products can reduce the uncertainty of single product 5 3 reason for quantifying enso using the pca approach the enso events are traditionally quantified in terms of region averaged sst anomaly in the tropical central eastern pacific luo et al 2016 ma et al 2018 khan et al 2021 considering the wsdi in prb is decomposed by using the pca approach in section 4 3 2 to extract the existent features it is reasonable to extract the corresponding features of the super el niño event also using the pca approach from the spatial gridded sst anomaly in the tropical central eastern pacific furthermore the correlation coefficient between the pc1 in fig 6c is as high as 0 90 however the correlation coefficient reduces to 0 86 with a 3 month lag p 0 05 when the pc1 in the tropical central eastern pacific is replaced with the region averaged sst anomaly since the pc1 mainly reflects the sst anomaly in the central eastern region of the tropical central eastern pacific fig 10a while the averaged sst anomaly consists of different pcs the differences between the time series of region averaged sst and pc1 in fig 10b reflect the rest pcs 5 4 influence factors of pc2 of wsdi in section 4 3 2 we can find the pc2 of wsdi exists significant east west differences and is less correlated with that of enso only 0 41 which needs to be further investigated table 6 shows the correlation coefficients between pc2 of wsdi and the possible climate factors including western pacific anomalous anticyclone wpac three parameters of western pacific subtropical high wpsh and asian monsoon where pc2 of wsdi is significantly positively with the west ridge point of western pacific subtropical high while negatively with indian monsoon im in addition section 4 3 2 has shown the pc2 of wsdi is significantly positively correlated with the pc2 of tios with a correlation coefficient of 0 66 then the significantly correlated climate factors are presented in fig 11a with the shaded area denoting the extreme flood period meanwhile the eof2 of tios is shown in fig 11b to express the spatial distribution corresponding to the pc2 in fig 11a the eof2 exists east west differences and the corresponding pc2 shows an obviously decreasing trend during the extreme flood period which indicates that the high temperature zone in the tropical indian ocean moves eastward moreover the indian monsoon im strengthens and the western pacific subtropical high wpsh extends westward during the extreme flood period in fig 11a therefore the spatial differences of the extreme flood event were favored by the eastward movement of the high temperature zone in the tropical indian ocean the enhancement of indian monsoon and the westward extension of western pacific subtropical high 6 conclusion the grace based wsdi successfully identifies the extreme flood event over prb during the super el niño from october 2014 to may 2016 the corresponding severity of the extreme flood event was 483 11 km3 and the peak value occurred in february 2016 76 11 km3 the extreme flood is mainly influenced by the super el niño after a 3 month lag the pc1 of wsdi reflects the flood condition in the entire prb and is significantly correlated to pc1 of enso with a correlation coefficient of 0 90 p 0 05 while the pc2 of wsdi reveals the east west spatial differences and is moderately correlated to pc2 of enso with the correlation coefficient of 0 41 p 0 1 furthermore tios in response to the super el niño also performs a critical role in the extreme flood event there exist significant correlations between the first two pcs of tios and that of wsdi with correlation coefficients of 0 81 and 0 66 for pc1 and pc2 with a 2 month delay p 0 05 respectively the favorable circulation anomalies during the 2014 2016 super el niño for the concurrent extreme flood over prb are associated with the following two factors one is the anticyclonic anomalies over the south china sea and the bay of bengal accompanied by a weakened south china sea monsoon which directly promoted more moisture transport towards prb the anticyclonic anomalies over the philippine sea and the south china sea contributed to the westward extension of the western pacific subtropical high further inducing the intensification of the western pacific subtropical high which is related to the second trigger of the extreme flood event the extreme flood event emerged in september 2015 in the western region of prb expanded to the entire basin in january 2016 and february 2016 then retreated to the eastern region of prb in may 2016 the spatial distribution of the extreme flood event can be reflected from pc2 of wsdi which is significantly correlated with the pc2 of tios im and the west ridge point of western pacific subtropical high respectively with the correlation coefficients of 0 66 0 66 and 0 55 p 0 05 specifically the high temperature zone in the tropical indian ocean moved eastward the indian monsoon enhanced and the western pacific subtropical high extended westward inducing the east west spatial differences

7637,study region pearl river basin prb has a tropical to subtropical climate in china study focus an unprecedented extreme flood broke out in prb during 2014 2016 super el niño period we construct the water storage deficit index wsdi to quantify this extreme flood event the principal component analysis approach is used to analyze the wsdi in prb and el niño southern oscillation enso and the sea surface temperature sst anomaly in the tropical indian ocean tios to identify the influence factors furthermore the underlying influence mechanisms are explored via correlation analysis new hydrological insights for the region the severity of the extreme flood event was 483 11 km3 with a maximum surplus of terrestrial water storage in february 2016 76 11 km3 the extreme flood was mainly influenced by the super el niño and enhanced by tios the wsdi is significantly correlated with enso and tios for the first and second principal components the correlation coefficients are 0 90 and 0 41 for enso after a 3 month lag and 0 86 and 0 66 for tios after a 2 month lag respectively the super el niño favored the extreme flood event by intensifying the anticyclones over the south china sea the philippine sea and the bay of bengal further promoting the attenuation of the south china sea monsoon and the westward extension of west pacific subtropical high inducing more moisture transport towards prb graphical abstract ga1 keywords grace extreme flood super el niño principal component analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction extreme weather events like floods droughts windstorms heatwaves and high temperatures occur more frequently as a result of global warming having a considerable impact on both the global and regional hydrological process alexander et al 2013 harder et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 ummenhofer et al 2017 yang et al 2021 the frequency and intensification of flash droughts will significantly increase because of the growing greenhouse gas concentrations during the middle and end of this century especially in southern china yuan et al 2019 the onset speed and frequency of extreme droughts such as the terrible flash drought in southeastern china in the summer of 2020 will increase by 85 and 49 wang and yuan 2022 the pearl river basin prb is located in the southeastern coastal region of china and is essential to the economic growth of china weng 2007 zhang et al 2009 zhang et al 2022a 2022b however it s vulnerable to extreme floods and droughts due to the position of tropical and subtropical climate zones huang et al 2021 xiao et al 2016 xu et al 2019 two prolonged droughts and five major floods have occurred over prb during the previous twenty years zhang et al 2019 huang et al 2021 xiao et al 2016 which performs disastrous influences on agriculture ecosystems and economic development in prb leichenko et al 2014 li et al 2016 dai et al 2020 therefore analyzing the characteristics and driving factors of droughts and floods over prb can provide the scientific basis for disaster prevention and water resource utilization drought and flood events are generally quantified with various drought indices byun et al 1999 pandey et al 2008 deo et al 2017 huang et al 2021 at present numerous hydro meteorological drought indices are available zargar et al 2011 meresa et al 2016 javadinejad et al 2020 such as the standardized streamflow index ssi shukla and wood 2008 the standardized precipitation index spi mckee 1993 and the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei beguería et al 2010 however these traditional drought indices only consider one or several hydrometeorological elements which is difficult to completely reflect the actual conditions of droughts or floods yi and wen 2016 nigatu et al 2021 and the required hydrometeorological variables and calculation methods of these indices are various which leads to the differences in monitoring droughts and floods cao et al 2015 yu et al 2019 furthermore the required hydrometeorological variables of these indices generally are obtained from in situ measurements or hydrological models sun et al 2018 the measurements are limited by the environmental dependence and sparse spatial distribution of gauging stations especially for scarcely regional streamflow stations the spatial characteristics of runoff changes are few studied creutzfeldt et al 2012 and the anthropogenic factors are usually ignored in hydrological models qi et al 2020 the observations from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace provide a unique opportunity to estimate global terrestrial water storage tws change with consistent data quality and spatial resolution tapley et al 2004 which reflects the total deficit or surplus of different hydrological components including groundwater storage surface water soil moisture and snow and combined effects of natural factors and human activities sun et al 2018 compensating the flaws of traditional hydro meteorological drought indices therefore the grace based drought indices are employed by numerous scientists for drought and flood identification yi and wen 2016 cao et al 2015 thomas et al 2014 sun et al 2018 yu et al 2019 for example the hydrological drought index ghdi from grace derived tws was used for drought monitoring in arid northwestern china and the total storage deficit index tsdi from grace based tws was utilized for drought identification in the continental united states respectively yi and wen 2016 cao et al 2015 besides thomas et al 2014 designed the water storage deficit index wsdi using tws anomalies relative to the monthly average nigatu et al 2021 evaluated eight major floods and ten droughts in the nile river basin based on wsdi among them the wsdi is characterized as dimensionless and seasonless sun et al 2018 yu et al 2019 and recommended for further application by liu et al 2020 and will be used in this study for flood evaluation previous studies have demonstrated the impacts of el niño southern oscillation enso on different regional climate changes salau et al 2012 kim et al 2011 yeh et al 2018 enso is a well known climate fluctuation factor concerning the sea surface temperature sst anomaly in tropical pacific that affects global precipitation and tws changes fig 1 chen et al 2020a b huang et al 2021 its warm period is known as el niño while its cold period is called la niña yao et al 2016 bookhagen and strecker 2010 combined grace and hydro meteorology data to analyze the tws changes in the amazon basin and its connection with enso events yu et al 2020 showed the tws changes in the three parallel rivers of the southeastern tibetan plateau from 2002 to 2016 lagged behind the enso events by 2 72 months the relationships between tws changes in the yangtze river basin and enso events have also been extensively researched xu et al 2005 yin et al 2009 ouyang et al 2014 furthermore the climate changes of prb significantly respond to enso events due to its proximity to the pacific ocean huang et al 2021 wu et al 2020 enso can affect the locations and intensities of western pacific anomalous anticyclone western pacific subtropical high south asian monsoon and east asian monsoon chen et al 2013 2020a b huang et al 2021 resulting in anomalous water vapor transporting to prb luo et al 2016 meanwhile the tropical indian ocean sst tios fig 1 rises under the el niño conditions generating kelvin waves which triggers the anticyclonic circulation and tropospheric lower anomalous easterly wind anomalies over the bay of bengal further regulating the water vapor transported towards prb klein et al 1999 lau et al 2000 ma et al 2018 khan et al 2021 western pacific subtropical high moves southward during the el niño periods thus inducing flood events over prb while western pacific subtropical high moves northward and prb is vulnerable to droughts during the la niña periods chen et al 2020a b luo et al 2016 the precipitation across prb is proportional to enso in autumn and winter while inversely proportional in spring ouyang et al 2014 huang et al 2016 and is more susceptible to enso in dry periods from october to march than in wet periods from april to september wu et al 2020 additionally enso and the variations of drought and flood in prb have consistent interannual periodic signals ranging from 32 to 62 months wu et al 2020 the el niño from 2014 to 2016 is regarded as one of three historic super events 1982 1983 1997 1998 and 2014 2016 and stronger than the first two events ma et al 2018 zhai et al 2016 disastrous weather occurred in response to the super el niño event from 2014 to 2016 around the world li and min 2016 kogan and guo 2017 kolusu et al 2019 for example the super el niño enhanced the global temperature that reached its warmest in 2015 after 1900 ma et al 2018 zhai et al 2016 the precipitation significantly increased over australia and southeast china but seriously decreased in southern africa northeast china and northwest china during this severe el niño event van rensch et al 2019 ma et al 2018 the water deficit in april 2015 reached 36 9 in the united states noaa 2016 extreme rainfall events struck the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in june july 2016 and agreed with the contemporary super el niño ranking as the most serious rainfall since 1951 yuan et al 2018 meanwhile an unprecedented extreme flood broke out over prb and its duration severity spatial coverage and mechanisms remain unexplored therefore this paper will study this extreme flood event over prb and its features based on grace based wsdi and investigate the relationships with super el niño by using the pca approach the structure of this paper is as follows section 2 introduces the study region and data source section 3 describes the investigated methods section 4 firstly explores the reliability of wsdi and the features of the extreme flood event over prb then investigates the long term impacts of enso and tios on wsdi and specific impacts on the extreme flood event and the underlying influence mechanisms section 5 presents the discussion and section 6 provides the conclusions 2 study area and data 2 1 study area prb is situated in southeastern china and adjacent to the south china sea and the tropical pacific fig 1 102 14 115 53 e 21 31 26 49 n it s the third largest drainage basin area in china prb originates from the yun gui plateau flowing eastward through six provinces yunnan province guizhou province hunan province jiangxi province guangxi province and guangdong province and finally into the south china sea it comprises the west river mainly including nanpan river hongshui river liu river and yu river the north river and the east river huang et al 2021 zhang et al 2009 prb is located in a tropical and subtropical climate zone with an annual mean temperature ranging from 14 to 22 c annual average precipitation spanning from 1200 to 2000 mm and relative humidity varying from 71 to 80 liu et al 2012 huang et al 2021 the precipitation is spatially uneven across prb and the eastern region is more plentiful than the western region east asian monsoon including western north pacific monsoon and south china sea monsoon and south asian monsoon including indian monsoon dominate the seasonal precipitation over prb which accounts for 4 5 of total annual precipitation during wet periods and decreases significantly during dry periods resulting in frequent floods and droughts huang et al 2021 liu et al 2012 2 2 tws anomaly data the monthly tws anomaly twsa spanning april 2002 to december 2016 after removing the mean value of 2004 2009 is estimated from grace level 3 rl06 release 06 mascon solutions with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 provided by the center for space research csr save et al 2016 since the mascon products can provide high resolution gridded values without stripe errors sun et al 2018 they can be used without further processing save et al 2016 in the csr mascon products the degree one coefficients are restored according to technical note 13 landerer 2019 the c20 coefficients are replaced with those from satellite laser ranging slr loomis et al 2020 and the glacial isostatic adjustment gia effects are corrected the ice6g d model peltier et al 2018 moreover since the 20 missing months in the csr rl06 mascon products are not continual during 2002 2016 the cubic spline interpolation approach which can ensure interpolation accuracy as shown in numerous research chen et al 2020a b feng et al 2022 huang et al 2021 is used to interpolate the missing data 2 3 hydrometeorological data enso is identified with the sst anomaly in the tropical central eastern pacific 170 e 120 w 5 s 5 n chen et al 2020a b hanley et al 2003 khan et al 2021 and tios is denoted as the sst anomaly in the tropical indian ocean 40 110 e 20 s 20 n yuan et al 2012 the monthly sst spatial resolution of 2 2 data from noaa extended reconstructed version 5 is adopted in this study the outgoing longwave radiation olr anomaly spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 is obtained from ncar noaa institution and the negative olr means an intensive atmospheric activity and vice versa li and min 2016 additionally we have downloaded the series of three parameters of western pacific subtropical high i e strength west ridge point and ridge line from the national climate center of china meteorological administration ncc cma the negative west ridge point means a westward extension of the western pacific subtropical high and vice versa and the positive ridge line denotes a northward movement of the western pacific subtropical high and vice versa liu et al 2012 the monthly multi level wind field and sea level pressure slp with a spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 are acquired from ncep ncar reanalysis center the wind dataset is used to express the asian monsoon including south china sea monsoon indian monsoon and western north pacific monsoon south china sea monsoon is derived from the difference between 850 hpa and 200 hpa zonal wind in the south china sea 0 10 n 100 130 e western north pacific monsoon is regarded as the difference of 850 hpa zonal wind between the northern pacific 20 30 n 110 140 e and the southern pacific 5 15 n 100 130 e indian monsoon is denoted as the difference of 850 hpa zonal wind between the indian peninsula 20 30 n 70 90 e and the indian ocean 5 15 n 40 80 e shi et al 2021 he et al 2020 moreover the mean slp in the pacific region 120 150 n 10 s 10 n is applied to calculate western pacific anomalous anticyclone wang et al 2000 the seasonal cycles of twsa and meteorological data are removed by the method in mishra et al 2021 the monthly precipitation data with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 in prb is derived from ncc cma which is generated from 2472 ground based meteorological stations after a rigorous spline interpolation the in site evapotranspiration is also acquired from ncc cma over 13 gauging stations in prb and the simulated evapotranspiration is from different products including the gleam model derived from remote sensing satellites the clm model provided by nasa and wghm 2 2d model and the detailed descriptions of these products have been presented in zhang et al 2022a 2022b ssi is a popular drought index and is usually expressed as ssi z with the time scale z of 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 months ssi z denotes the accumulated runoff over z consecutive months and the positive values mean wet conditions while the negative values mean dry ones shukla and wood 2008 in this study the in site streamflow to calculate the ssi time series is derived from the outlets of three tributaries in prb i e the shijiao station the boluo station and the gaoyao station are respectively located at the north river the east river and the west river the ssi can be divided into different levels to identify the intensity of flood and drought events shown in table 1 ozkaya et al 2019 zalokar et al 2021 the details about ssi can be found in vicente serrano et al 2014 3 methodology 3 1 construction of water storage deficit index wsdi the residual twsa after deducting the mean value of each month of twsa from april 2002 to december 2016 is used to estimate the water storage deficit wsd and expressed as follows thomas et al 2014 1 wsd i j twsa i j twsa j where twsa i j is the value of the jth month in the ith year and the averaged twsa time series in the jth month represents twsa j the positive negative wsd continuously persisting over three months can be identified as a flood drought event the total severity s t of the tth drought flood event is the multiplication of average deficit surplus m t and duration d t throughout the flood drought period 2 s t m t d t the wsdi is derived from wsd using a zero mean normalization method aiming to better compare with other drought indices thomas et al 2014 sinha et al 2017 3 wsdi i j wsd i j μ σ where μ and σ are the mean and the standardized deviation of the wsd time series based on wsdi the classification for the level of drought and flood is shown in table 1 nie et al 2017 ozkaya et al 2019 nigatu et al 2021 3 2 principal component analysis pca pca is an efficient method to divide spatiotemporal variability into different modes in hydrologic and meteorologic which can reduce the dimensionality of valuables but still retain the most dominant spatiotemporal characteristics of the raw dataset morgan et al 2020 he et al 2020 here we apply pca to decompose the wsdi or enso and tios into empirical orthogonal functions eofs and principal components pcs which correspond to the spatial and temporal variations respectively the wsdi or enso and tios can be denoted with the matrix x with m rows and n columns which respectively represent the numbers of the spatial grids in the study area and the months of the study period the matrix x can be decomposed as preisendorfer 1988 4 x e λ f t where e is an m m normalized orthogonal matrix and its column vectors represent the eofs λ is an m m diagonal matrix it diagonal elements λ i are called singular values f is an n m normalized column orthogonal matrix the product of matrix λ and matrix f t is called the pc matrix p 5 p λ f t the row vectors of the p matrix are the temporal pcs since the singular values are sorted in descending order i e λ 1 λ 2 λ m the first several eofs pcs contain the main contributions and are used to express the spatiotemporal characteristics of wsdi or enso and tios the contribution rate α of the first several eofs pcs is estimated as follows preisendorfer 1988 6 α j 1 k λ j j 1 m λ j 100 where k is the number of selected first pcs the relationship between wsdi and enso can be indicated by the lead lag correlation coefficient r i between the first pcs of wsdi wsdi pc i i 1 k and that of enso enso pc i i 1 k as follows chen et al 2020a b 7 r i t 1 n wsdi pc i t τ wsdi pc i enso pc i t enso pc i t 1 n wsdi pc i t τ wsdi pc i 2 t 1 n enso pc i t enso pc i 2 where wsdi pc i and enso pc i are the mean values of wsdi pc i t and enso pc i t with n epochs the lagged time τ is denoted as the maximum r of the two time series less than 6 months and negative lagged months indicate wsdi lags behind enso while positive lagged months represent wsdi is ahead of enso when the r i reaches a 95 confidence level showing the two time series are significantly correlated additionally the relationship between wsdi and tios can also be identified by the correlation coefficient r i when the first pcs of enso are replaced by that of tios tios pc i i 1 k 3 3 grace based and water balance based tws changes to validate the tws changes based on grace data t w s c g r a c e from csr rl06 mascon products the tws change from the water balance equation t w s c w b is used and expressed as follows 8 t w s c w b t p t r t e t where p t r t and e t respectively represent the precipitation streamflow and evapotranspiration at t month the inflow streamflow is negligible in the prb huang et al 2021 t w s c g r a c e is the twsa difference between two adjacent months long et al 2016 9 t w s c g r a c e t t w s a t t w s a t 1 d t the proximity of t w s c w b and t w s c g r a c e is determined with the following root mean square error rmse 10 r m s e t 1 n t w s c w b t t w s c g r a c e t 2 n where n represents the months of the study period 4 results and analysis 4 1 comparison of wsdi with ssi the latitude weighted time series of wsdi and ssi z with the time scales z of 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 months are shown in fig 2 respectively for these time scales the correlation coefficients at the confidence level of 95 are 0 61 0 81 0 79 0 77 0 73 between wsdi and ssi z indicating that wsdi is well correlated with ssi at these time scales hence wsdi can reflect the long term cumulative effects of droughts and floods the best correlation between wsdi and ssi is at the time scale of 3 months since the wsdi reflects the total deficit surplus of different hydrological components including groundwater storage surface water soil moisture and snow the responsive time of which to droughts or floods is different zhao et al 2017 ran et al 2021 whereas ssi at larger time scales is affected by long term runoff anomalies in the past which will disturb the intensity of droughts or floods in the current month ran et al 2021 chui et al 2021 4 2 features of the 2015 2016 flood event fig 3 illustrates the latitude weighted time series of grace based wsd and its normalized index wsdi spanning from april 2002 to december 2016 there exist six flood events during the study period according to the wsd time series i e the positive wsd continuously lasts over three months which are marked with shaded areas in fig 3a the major surplus periods coincide with the flood conditions that are reported by the water resources bulletin of prb pearl river water conservancy commission 2002 2016 the periods durations peak values severities and intensities of the six floods are summarized in table 2 where the most extensive flood event lasted for 17 months august 2015 to december 2016 and the corresponding severity was 692 62 km3 furthermore the maximum tws repletion over prb was 76 11 km3 in february 2016 and only the 2015 2016 flood event reached an extreme level fig 3b to further investigate the spatial evolution of the 2015 2016 flood event we show the spatial distribution of wsdi in fig 4 the extreme flood mainly assembles spanning from september 2015 to may 2016 hereafter the extreme flood period taking up 70 of total tws surplus throughout the flood period august 2015 to december 2016 the extreme flood originated in september 2015 from the western region spread eastward and expanded to the entire basin in january 2016 and february 2016 then retreated to the eastern region 4 3 influences of enso and tios on wsdi 4 3 1 long term influences the latitude weighted time series of wsdi enso and tios during 2002 2016 are presented in fig 5 a c and the light red shaded areas represent the el niño periods while the light blue shaded areas represent the la niña periods ignoring the weak cold phase from july 2005 to june 2006 combining fig 5a with fig 5b we can find that the conditions of droughts and floods in the prb significantly change due to the phase transformations of enso specifically when the first el niño period april 2002 to february 2007 turned into the first la niña period march 2007 to ma 2009 then into the second el niño period june 2009 to april 2010 and then into the second la niña period ma 2010 to march 2014 and the third el niño period april 2014 to june 2016 the prb transformed from continuous drought to moderate flood then to moderate drought and then to severe drought and extreme flood respectively furthermore the phases of tios in fig 5c are consistent with enso except for the first el niño period from the lead lag correlations between wsdi and enso tios in fig 5 d f we can see that the wsdi is more affected by tios in fig 5 d e while closer to enso in fig 5 f because the strength of enso was relatively weak from april 2002 to april 2010 and the prb is closer to indian ocean while enso dramatically enhanced from may 2010 to june 2016 greatly influencing the variances of droughts and floods over prb the wsdi is significantly correlated with enso and tios at different stages the best is in fig 5f with the correlation coefficient of 0 69 and 0 68 and the worst is in fig 5d with the correlation coefficient of 0 38 and 0 52 indicating enso and tios can chronically influence the variances of floods and droughts over the prb 4 3 2 specific influences on the extreme flood event the strongest el niño event since 1951 which occurred from october 2014 to may 2016 can be divided into five stages namely initial stages october 2014 to january 2015 developing stages february 2015 to may 2015 outbreaking stages june 2015 to september 2015 mature stages october 2015 to january 2016 and decaying stages february 2016 to may 2016 wang 1995 the lagged effect of any stage possibly leads to climate anomalies over prb huang et al 2016 therefore we take the entire stage of the super el niño to analyze its influences on the concurrent extreme flood event the first two eofs and pcs of decomposed wsdi and enso by using the pca approach are presented in fig 6 a d with the shaded areas denoting the extreme flood period and the corresponding lead lag correlation coefficients are shown in fig 6 e f the first two pcs of wsdi respectively account for 80 3 and 11 7 of the total variance furthermore eof1 of wsdi shows a spatial coherence across prb and the corresponding pc1 exhibits a remarkably increasing trend revealing the entire basin becomes wetter which benefits from the outbreaking of the extreme flood event eof2 of wsdi shows the differences between the western and eastern regions of prb and the corresponding pc2 presents a prominently decreasing trend indicating the center of the extreme flood event gradually moves to the eastern region which is in accordance with the spatial variability of wsdi in fig 4 furthermore the first two pcs of enso take up 95 8 of the total variance with 88 5 and 7 3 for pc1 and pc2 respectively after a 3 month delay of enso the pc1 in fig 6c is highly correlated with the correlation coefficient of 0 90 fig 6e while pc2 in fig 6d is moderately correlated with the correlation coefficient of 0 41 fig 6f accordingly the super el niño performed the leading function and triggered the extreme flood event which lagged three months behind the development of super el niño under the mechanisms of atmospheric bridge or indonesian throughflow khan et al 2021 ma et al 2018 tios generally rises in response to the super el niño event and it likely affects the extreme flood event hence the first two pcs of decomposed tios by using the pca approach are also shown in fig 6 c d where the pc1 and pc2 respectively explain 68 8 and 11 1 of the total variance moreover the pcs of wsdi are significantly correlated with that of tios with the correlation coefficients of 0 81 and 0 66 for pc1 and pc2 after a delay of 2 months fig 6 e f therefore tios is 1 month after the super el niño event and enhanced the extreme flood event 4 4 underlying influence mechanisms enso indirectly impacts the climate in prb by influencing the atmospheric circulation over east asia and south asia such as asian monsoon including south china sea monsoon indian monsoon and western north pacific monsoon western pacific subtropical high and western pacific anomalous anticyclone chen et al 2013 2020a b li et al 2016 to feature the influence mechanisms of the super el niño event on the extreme flood event we compute the correlation coefficients between the pc1 of wsdi enso and tios and the possible climate factors including western pacific anomalous anticyclone wpac three parameters of western pacific subtropical high wpsh and asian monsoon and show the results in table 3 we can observe from table 3 that pc1 of wsdi enso and tios is significantly positively correlated with the western pacific anomalous anticyclone and the strength of western pacific subtropical high while negatively correlated with the west ridge point of western pacific subtropical high and south china sea monsoon scsm then we present the significantly correlated climate factors in fig 7 with the shaded area indicating the extreme flood period during the extreme flood period in fig 7 the western pacific anomalous anticyclone and western pacific subtropical high are considerably stronger while the south china sea monsoon is obviously weaker than before and the west ridge point of western pacific subtropical high extends westward hence the super el niño favored the extreme flood event by promoting the intensification of the western pacific anomalous anticyclone and western pacific subtropical high the westward extension of the western pacific subtropical high and the attenuation of the south china sea monsoon fig 8 shows the anomalies of sea surface temperature sst outgoing longwave radiation olr sea level pressure slp and 850 hpa wind during the extreme flood stage respectively the sst increases in the tropical east pacific while decreases in the tropical west pacific fig 8a whereas the olr and slp in fig 8 b c show an opposite spatial distribution to the sst anomaly in fig 8a the positive olr anomaly means a weakened tropospheric activity and the positive slp is always accompanied by anomalous anticyclones li and min 2016 wang et al 2000 therefore the physical mechanisms behind this extreme flood event can be concluded as follows the sst in the tropical east pacific was significantly higher than that in the tropical west pacific which suppressed the tropospheric activity over the tropical west pacific and further reduced the warming functions on the atmosphere over this region li and min 2016 that aroused an atmospheric rossby wave then promoted the westward movement of high pressure area li and min 2016 yang et al 2012 resulting in the anticyclones over the philippine sea and the south china sea meanwhile tios increased under the el niño conditions which can generate kelvin waves triggering the anomalies of lower east wind and the anticyclonic circulation over the bay of bengal ma et al 2018 khan et al 2021 subsequently the anticyclones over the south china sea and the bay of bengal accompanying a weakened south china sea monsoon directly promoted more water vapors toward prb and the anticyclones over the philippine sea and the south china sea enhanced the westward extension of western pacific subtropical high further inducing the intensification of western pacific subtropical high which also favored this extreme flood event 5 discussion 5 1 direct hydrometeorological factors on the extreme flood event the variances of droughts and floods over the prb can be directly influenced by the deficit or surplus of precipitation p evapotranspiration e and runoff r the normalized precipitation and its differences with evapotranspiration and runoff at different time scales are presented in fig 9 the methods of normalization and time scales as ssi vicente serrano et al 2014 and the shaded areas represent the 2015 2016 extreme flood event from fig 9 we can find that the conditions of droughts and floods in the prb change little when removing runoff or evapotranspiration from precipitation indicating precipitation is the most important direct meteorological factor on the variances of droughts and floods over the prb therefore the 2015 2016 extreme flood event identified by wsdi is mainly favored by heavy precipitation rather than the discharges from other basins which is consistent with the results in section 4 4 that the sst dramatically increases in the tropical east pacific and indian ocean indirectly favoring more water vapors toward prb through affecting the atmospheric circulation and then inducing a extreme flood event 5 2 comparison of different grace level 3 products besides the csr mascon products other level 3 grace products from the jet propulsion laboratory jpl watkins et al 2015 and the tongji reggrace2019 solution chen et al 2021 are used to derive the tws changes and compared with those from the water balance equation ground based precipitation and streamflow due to large uncertainty in measuring evapotranspiration we also use another three simulated evapotranspiration products including gleam clm and wghm the correlation coefficient and rmse estimated with the tws changes differences between grace products and the water balance estimates using different evapotranspiration products are presented in table 4 and table 5 respectively the result show csr mascon estimates are closer to the water balance estimates for different evapotranspiration products than the other two grace estimates with the maximum correlation coefficient and minimal rmse and used in this study additionally the correlation coefficients are proximal between grace based tws changes and water balance estimates with different evapotranspiration products excepting for wghm and the rmse is lowest with the averaged values of four evapotranspiration products revealing that considering multiple evapotranspiration products can reduce the uncertainty of single product 5 3 reason for quantifying enso using the pca approach the enso events are traditionally quantified in terms of region averaged sst anomaly in the tropical central eastern pacific luo et al 2016 ma et al 2018 khan et al 2021 considering the wsdi in prb is decomposed by using the pca approach in section 4 3 2 to extract the existent features it is reasonable to extract the corresponding features of the super el niño event also using the pca approach from the spatial gridded sst anomaly in the tropical central eastern pacific furthermore the correlation coefficient between the pc1 in fig 6c is as high as 0 90 however the correlation coefficient reduces to 0 86 with a 3 month lag p 0 05 when the pc1 in the tropical central eastern pacific is replaced with the region averaged sst anomaly since the pc1 mainly reflects the sst anomaly in the central eastern region of the tropical central eastern pacific fig 10a while the averaged sst anomaly consists of different pcs the differences between the time series of region averaged sst and pc1 in fig 10b reflect the rest pcs 5 4 influence factors of pc2 of wsdi in section 4 3 2 we can find the pc2 of wsdi exists significant east west differences and is less correlated with that of enso only 0 41 which needs to be further investigated table 6 shows the correlation coefficients between pc2 of wsdi and the possible climate factors including western pacific anomalous anticyclone wpac three parameters of western pacific subtropical high wpsh and asian monsoon where pc2 of wsdi is significantly positively with the west ridge point of western pacific subtropical high while negatively with indian monsoon im in addition section 4 3 2 has shown the pc2 of wsdi is significantly positively correlated with the pc2 of tios with a correlation coefficient of 0 66 then the significantly correlated climate factors are presented in fig 11a with the shaded area denoting the extreme flood period meanwhile the eof2 of tios is shown in fig 11b to express the spatial distribution corresponding to the pc2 in fig 11a the eof2 exists east west differences and the corresponding pc2 shows an obviously decreasing trend during the extreme flood period which indicates that the high temperature zone in the tropical indian ocean moves eastward moreover the indian monsoon im strengthens and the western pacific subtropical high wpsh extends westward during the extreme flood period in fig 11a therefore the spatial differences of the extreme flood event were favored by the eastward movement of the high temperature zone in the tropical indian ocean the enhancement of indian monsoon and the westward extension of western pacific subtropical high 6 conclusion the grace based wsdi successfully identifies the extreme flood event over prb during the super el niño from october 2014 to may 2016 the corresponding severity of the extreme flood event was 483 11 km3 and the peak value occurred in february 2016 76 11 km3 the extreme flood is mainly influenced by the super el niño after a 3 month lag the pc1 of wsdi reflects the flood condition in the entire prb and is significantly correlated to pc1 of enso with a correlation coefficient of 0 90 p 0 05 while the pc2 of wsdi reveals the east west spatial differences and is moderately correlated to pc2 of enso with the correlation coefficient of 0 41 p 0 1 furthermore tios in response to the super el niño also performs a critical role in the extreme flood event there exist significant correlations between the first two pcs of tios and that of wsdi with correlation coefficients of 0 81 and 0 66 for pc1 and pc2 with a 2 month delay p 0 05 respectively the favorable circulation anomalies during the 2014 2016 super el niño for the concurrent extreme flood over prb are associated with the following two factors one is the anticyclonic anomalies over the south china sea and the bay of bengal accompanied by a weakened south china sea monsoon which directly promoted more moisture transport towards prb the anticyclonic anomalies over the philippine sea and the south china sea contributed to the westward extension of the western pacific subtropical high further inducing the intensification of the western pacific subtropical high which is related to the second trigger of the extreme flood event the extreme flood event emerged in september 2015 in the western region of prb expanded to the entire basin in january 2016 and february 2016 then retreated to the eastern region of prb in may 2016 the spatial distribution of the extreme flood event can be reflected from pc2 of wsdi which is significantly correlated with the pc2 of tios im and the west ridge point of western pacific subtropical high respectively with the correlation coefficients of 0 66 0 66 and 0 55 p 0 05 specifically the high temperature zone in the tropical indian ocean moved eastward the indian monsoon enhanced and the western pacific subtropical high extended westward inducing the east west spatial differences

7638,study region halifax nova scotia canada study focus many lakes in the halifax region are approaching or exceeding the chronic freshwater aquatic life guideline for chloride cl presumably due to the application of deicing salts these exceedances represent an ecological risk that requires mitigation for lakes currently experiencing high cl and preventative steps should be taken to protect lakes that will be impacted by future development in this study we paired geospatial analysis with linear regression methods to identify key factors contributing to elevated cl in halifax lakes and applied a mass balance modeling approach to estimate annual cl loading rates for dominant land uses within the region new hydrological insights for the region the watershed variables found to be most

salt code of practice this code encourages the use of best management practices bmps the creation of salt management plans and the identification of salt vulnerable areas to combat deleterious effects eccc 2004 canadian freshwater aquatic life guidelines use a species sensitivity distribution method to assess the risk that contaminant concentrations pose to ecosystems ccme 2007 for chronic exposure to cl this guideline value is set at 120 mg l to protect 99 of species over indefinite exposure the acute guideline of 640 mg l is set to protect ecosystem function over transient exposures ccme 2011 land use planning has been identified as one of the most effective strategies to protect freshwaters from high cl without compromising road safety blaszczak et al 2019 dugan et al 2020 canadian studies considering various degrees of watershed urbanization have found a development threshold at 25 of watershed area over which cl are likely to exceed current chronic guideline levels winter et al 2011 scott et al 2019 moreover different types of development e g residential commercial and agricultural have been found to have varying de icing salt loading rates or influences on lake cl dugan et al 2020 lam et al 2020 thus explicitly incorporating cl loading potential and resulting lake impacts into urban land use planning will be critical to mitigating this environmental threat univariate and multivariate statistical techniques have been applied to explore drivers of lake cl across north america and western europe typically the application of these statistical models makes use of large spatial or temporal datasets to determine which combination of lake and or watershed characteristics best explain the variation in cl in a suite of lakes novotny et al 2008 winter et al 2011 kelting et al 2012 scott et al 2019 doucet et al 2022 using multilinear regression kelting et al 2012 found that road densities separated into classes interstate state road u s route and local were able to explain 87 of the cl variation in the lakes of adirondack park ny n 82 in halifax nova scotia scott et al 2019 found that urban development as percent watershed coverage was the most significant explanatory variable for lake cl in a group of urban lakes physically based models have also been used to estimate cl loading to a lake from different sources müller and gächter 2012 nava et al 2020 and or to estimate future lake cl chapra et al 2009 novotny and stefan 2010 dugan et al 2021 while modeling cl is relatively simple because of its conservative nature this approach usually requires several years of frequent grab sampling or high frequency conductivity data for calibration in a particular system or region chapra et al 2009 novotny and stefan 2010 winter et al 2011 nava et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 some studies have also applied a mass balance method to quantify watershed cl loads coupled with regression approaches to correlate subcatchment characteristics to the concentrations winter et al 2011 dugan et al 2021 the halifax regional municipality hrm in the canadian province of nova scotia has been rapidly urbanizing over the past 40 years with associated impacts to lake water quality doucet 2022 of particular note the combination of dense road networks and high frequency of winter weather events leads to heavy use of de icing salts to ensure winter road safety environment canada health canada 2001 spring peaks and fall minima of lake cl are typical in the hrm as most lakes have flushing rates that exceed 1 yr and watersheds have little capacity for storage in groundwater soils thus all road salts are thought to reach receiving waters within one year of their application scott et al 2019 synoptic decadal surveys of hrm lakes dating back to 1980 have measured elevated and increasing cl clement and gordon 2019 though the road salt code of practice has been in place for nearly 20 years many hrm lakes still experience spring exceedances of the chronic guideline level and some of these lakes have experienced significant increases in spring cl since 2011 doucet 2022 this pattern suggests that the recommended mitigation methods or the levels of uptake are not adequate to protect aquatic habitats approaches for predicting the impacts of future development on lake cl should be developed and calibrated at the regional scale due to differences in salting practices climate land use and hydrology the hrm is a rapidly urbanizing region with an abundance 1000 of lakes that are highly valued ecosystems in watersheds with pronounced differences in development and landscape characteristics the overall objective of this study was to address a growing need for land use planning tools needed to conduct lake cl vulnerability assessments in the hrm the specific objectives were i to quantify relationships between lake cl and watershed characteristics to evaluate whether influential factors identified in other regions are relevant in hrm and ii to produce a predictive cl loading model based on land zoning categories that may be used to assess potential development impacts on lakes during urban planning processes 2 methods 2 1 study region lakes and watersheds all study lakes and their watersheds are located 3 partially 54 fully within the hrm the study area represents a mix of urban and rural land use with the most intensive urban development occurring near the halifax and dartmouth urban centres figs 1 and s1 the study area is underlain mostly by ground moraine streamline drift and rock with smaller patches of alluvial colluvial and organic deposits table s1 the region has humid modified continental climate with a mean daily temperature of 6 6 c min 1 9 max 11 3 c receiving on average 1396 mm of precipitation yearly 1196 mm as rainfall and 221 cm of snow eccc 2010 the lakes belong to 12 secondary watersheds drainage basins that drain to the coast and 21 of the lakes in the dataset are headwater lakes estimates of background freshwater cl in the region vary greatly due to the province s large coastline and changes in deposition of salts with distance from the ocean underwood et al 1988 table s2 however the average concentration in precipitation is estimated to be 2 7 mg l for the province underwood et al 1988 and a maximum background cl of 20 mg l has been used for coastal lakes environment canada health canada 2001 chloride data was collected by the energy and environment division of hrm as part of the lake water quality monitoring program between 2006 and 2011 water samples were collected from 57 lakes in the municipality three times per year spring summer fall as surface grab samples stantec 2012 to smooth seasonal and annual variability mitigate effects of small gaps in the dataset and allow for comparison with long term guidelines mean cl over the entire study period were calculated and used for analysis summary statistics were calculated in minitab statistical software to characterize the cl dataset the degree of spatial clustering of the values was tested using both global and local indicators of spatial autocorrelation i e ansellin s moran s i in arcgis pro anselin 1995 lakes were then manually categorized into risk levels according to their mean cl as compared to the ccme long term guideline for the protection of aquatic life risk level groups were used for data visualization and model assessment only watersheds were delineated from a 5 m lidar derived digital elevation model dem where possible hrm 2013a but a provincially available 20 m dem ns l f 2006 was used for several watersheds point based delineation methods were executed using the archydro in arcgis pro with the additional step of dem reconditioning environmental systems research institute esri 2011 this step lowered and created a slight gradient towards roads and streams hrm 2012 lowered by 1 m that were considered preferential flow paths as well as linear flow paths natural resources canada 2019 lowered by 10 m to maintain hydrological connectivity through lakes watersheds were modified manually to account for stormwater infrastructure halifax water 2019 and neighboring watershed boundaries all spatial analysis was completed in the nad 1983 csrs utm zone 20 n spatial reference system epsg 2958 we considered this spatial reference system to be appropriate as it is a local projection with very small 0 04 distortions of length and area inside the utm zone snyder 1987 2 2 statistical analysis ordinary linear regression to test the relationship between the proposed explanatory variables and cl was executed in minitab software residuals from the models were tested for degree of spatial autocorrelation using the global moran s i indicator using the arcgis pro software platform all potential explanatory variables were intersected with the watersheds layer and summarized to generate a total length area occurrence for each watershed explanatory variables that are expressed as a density road density stormwater pipe density or areal percent coverage surficial geology units urban area were normalized to their watershed area variables investigated included municipally managed infrastructure roads sidewalks salt storage facilities water infrastructure stormwater pipes and outfalls ditches and wastewater treatment plants halifax water 2019 surficial geology units stea and fisher 2006 distance from the coast as watershed midpoint to nearest coastline and urban development roads were investigated as total road density road density by street class type local including those with no assigned classification major collectors minor collectors arterials and expressways ramp density in addition to street class and by maintenance type ice routes salt sand all data layers were available except for urban land use from within the study period the urban land use layer was generated through the classification of landsat 5 thematic mapper tm imagery acquired august 15th 2009 path 008 row 029 usgs 2009 in arcgis pro software using an unsupervised classification approach the unsupervised classification applied pixel based hard classification logic and employed an isodata classification algorithm with 50 target spectral classes while 50 target spectral classes is likely excessive for this classification it was necessary to reliably separate bare rock from concrete landcovers that are commonly confused spectrally classes representing urban developed areas were selected and aggregated through reclassification into an urban raster the majority filter tool was applied to remove isolated misclassified cells within larger contiguous groups of urban classified areas the classification layer was then converted from raster to a vector feature class from which lake polygons were erased to omit rocky shorelines from being included in the developed area estimate this urban layer was subset to watersheds before a confusion matrix was generated and an accuracy assessment completed using a stratified random sample of 200 points simple linear regressions i e bivariate manually selected models and models from a best subsets regression were investigated a correlation matrix was created in minitab fig s5 table s4 and variables that had the strongest relationships with cl were selected for simple linear regression in multiple linear regressions highly colinear variables were not used together two models were manually selected for multiple linear regression using variables with known or assumed relationships with road salt these models were i an expressway model using an expressway density the density of all other roads and ramp density and ii a maintenance model using the density of salted ice routes and the density of municipally maintained sidewalks best subsets regressions were used to find the most explanatory sets of variables models with the highest predictive r2 values were investigated further those with constants well outside of the background range for chloride and those that assigned negative coefficients to variables that did not make physical sense were discarded models were assessed based on predictive r2 values between predicted and observed mean cl variable p values and variance inflation factors vif were used to assess collinearity vif 5 and p 0 05 considered acceptable standardized coefficients were used to assess variable contribution and model constants and corrected akaike s information coefficients aics were used to assess model fit anselin s local moran s i was carried out in arcgis pro to identify clusters and outliers for cl and road density data to further explore any relationship between total road density and mean lake cl 2 3 mass balance modeling land area within each watershed was classified into four land use types rural commercial residential and roads fig 2 methods based on the concept of inverse loading analysis chapra et al 2009 and adapted from those presented by novotny and stefan 2010 were used to calculate a range of loading coefficients for each land use category based on its area within each watershed and the mean cl measured in the lake zoning data from 2008 was available through hrm zoned parcels do not include road area so parcels were classified into three categories rural commercial or residential based on their zone code as described in by law documents hrm 2018 parcels were categorized by zoned land use only landcover as determined from satellite imagery from within the study period was only considered in a few cases as noted below the commercial category includes industrial airports industrial parks some portions of mining operations and some processing facilities institutional hospitals government buildings and schools including greenspaces and sports fields associated with them and commercial land uses this category includes some parcels zoned for mixed use where commercial use was the primary use however home business zones were excluded the residential category includes only urban and suburban residential development this includes any residential zone code listing a minimum lot area 93 m2 10 000 ft2 zones listing separate minimum lot areas for septic and municipally serviced lots were visually estimated for average density using google earth imagery from within the study period parcels that were zoned for high to low density housing but remained undeveloped during the study period were classified as undeveloped partially developed parcels were classified as rural residential if the lot size averaged over the parcel area was estimated to be greater than 10 000 ft2 the rural land use category includes rural residential land uses residential zones with minimum lot size 10 000 ft2 and previously listed exceptions from residential resource land uses agriculture forestry fisheries and some of the associated processing facilities parks and conservation areas includes parks and some municipally owned recreational facilities including buildings and associated parking lots nature reserves wilderness areas and urban reserves that had yet not been developed during the study period some watersheds extend past hrm boundaries shubenacadie grand kinsac and mccabe lakes for these areas a land cover database ns nrr 2020 was used in lieu of zoning data these areas were found to be largely resource or rural except for some more densely developed polygons which were reclassified to residential land use a categorized zoning layer was then intersected with the study watersheds and areas were summarized by land use category to obtain an area per category per watershed an approximation of road area was obtained from the 2008 street line dataset hrm 2012 for which line length was summarized by watershed and street class type these values were then multiplied by their estimated widths from hrm design guidelines hrm 2013b to obtain an area the guidelines provide a range of road widths for different scenarios in both urban and rural contexts for this study a value from within the urban range was selected for area calculations because the urban specifications were generally narrower giving a more conservative estimate generally these values also fell within the guidelines rural range streets with null street class were assumed to be local streets and were assigned the local street width for area calculation expressway width was taken to be 12 5 m from the highway design guidelines and was rounded to the nearest half metre it should be noted highways use a narrower width as each direction is usually represented by a separate street line ns tir 2015 an annual cl load g yr was calculated for each study lake 1 m c l ρ c l q 0 where mcl is the annual cl load to a lake g yr ρcl is the mean of all samples cl g m3 for a lake and qo is the total hydraulic outflow of the lake m3 yr all lakes were assumed to flush at least once per year and to have ratios of drainage basin area to lake area sufficiently large to be able to assume that atmospheric deposition directly on a lake s surface was negligible in comparison to that on the watershed lake outflows were estimated using the method from the nova scotia user s manual for phosphorus prediction brylinsky 2004 2 q o a o p r a d r u q i a o e v where ao is the lake surface area m2 pr is the annual unit precipitation m yr ad is the drainage basin area excluding lake m2 ru is the annual unit hydraulic run off m yr qi is the upstream hydraulic input m3 yr and ev is the annual unit lake evaporation m yr precipitation and evaporation data was obtained from the eccc weather station nearest each lake s centroid table s6 the long term average canadian climate normals 1981 2010 for each parameter was used runoff values were estimated from a provincial isorunoff map fig s2 brimley et al 1985 as cited in brylinsky 2004 in all cases the centroid fell within the watershed for outflow calculations all lakes were treated as having no upstream lakes contributing to inflow qi 0 except for those receiving outflow from lake charles which drains in two directions and was assumed to drain evenly to lake micmac and lake william 50 each an annual predicted cl load was calculated for each lake using 3 m c l pred i n a lu i l lu i where mcl pred is the predicted mass of cl input to a lake annually alui is the total area of a land use category in the lake s watershed and llui is the estimated loading rate for a land use category i is an individual land use category and n is all land use categories land use loading rates were generated in excel using the solver function with the generalized reduced gradient grg nonlinear solving method the model aimed to reduce the root mean squared error rmse between the calculated annual cl loads of the lakes eq 1 and those estimated by the model eq 3 by changing the loading coefficients over successive iterations model performance was judged primarily by the r2 value between calculated lake cl loads and model estimated cl loads because the land use categories were broad and salting rates likely vary within them a range of possible cl loading rates were estimated for each category the range was obtained by performing a multi calibration by applying a selection without replacement approach a total of 50 calibration runs were conducted where in each run 67 of the data was used to fit calibrate the loading rates and the remaining 33 were used to validate the fit the loading rates for each land use category were then plotted in a box and whisker plot using r statistical software r core team 2022 and the interquartile range was taken as the lower and upper limits of the loading rate range the upper limit of the range was used to assess model performance based on estimated cl concentration and classification of lakes by risk level 3 results 3 1 lake and watershed characteristics the study lakes represent a range of lake and watershed characteristics table s1 the smallest lake in the dataset is dent s punch bowl 0 97 ha while the largest is shubenacadie grand lake 1883 ha their watersheds cover 9 8 ha and 36 917 ha respectively the watersheds studied range widely in their degree of development this variability is seen in the distribution of key indicators like road density 0 11 8 km km2 expressway density 0 2 1 km km2 percent of urban landcover 6 6 85 1 and percent coverage of rural 0 99 4 commercial 0 89 7 and urban suburban residential 0 76 3 land uses some lakes receive drainage almost exclusively by piped stormwater conveyance systems red bridge pond cranberry lake settle lake and bissett lake while some contain no stormwater piping at all apart from culverts bell desaid several watersheds extend beyond or exist outside of the municipal stormwater service boundary and do not have complete coverage of drainage infrastructure data lake echo hubley big lake black point lake sheldrake lake mccabe lake kinsac lake shubenacadie grand lake but would presumably be serviced by roadside ditches and culverts 3 2 lake chloride concentrations the distribution of mean cl among study lakes is positively skewed skewness 0 62 fig s3 with most of the mean concentrations falling below 53 mg l and a tail containing a few extremely high values the data are also spatially clustered with a global moran s i of 0 47 z score 6 24 p 0 001 and local moran s i analysis showing two significant clusters of high cl in the south of the study area on either side of halifax harbour fig s4 the lakes were divided into four groups based on mean cl fig 3 impacted lakes 11 red high risk lakes 9 orange moderate risk lakes 22 yellow and low risk lakes 15 blue the impacted red lakes had mean cl that exceed the ccme chronic guideline level of 120 mg l of the 11 lakes in this group eight had cl exceeding guideline levels for three or more consecutive sampling events indicating that these eight lakes did not comply with the chronic guideline for chloride concentration though these exceedances do not necessarily indicate negative impacts according to canadian ccme guidelines the united states environmental protection agency us epa states that systems that exceed chronic guidelines more frequently than once in any three year period are in a constant state of recovery and so are likely to be impacted us epa 2017 high risk lakes orange had mean cl between 80 mg l and 119 mg l of the nine lakes in this category eight had at least one cl measurement that exceeded the chronic guideline though sporadic exceedances of the guideline do not indicate chronic impairment of the ecosystem due to cl recent evidence suggests food webs may be impacted at levels below the chronic guideline hintz et al 2022 moderate risk yellow lakes experienced mean cl between 21 and 79 mg l none of the 22 lakes in this category possessed cl that exceeded the chronic guideline during sampling events but all of these lakes had mean cl that exceeded maximum background levels low risk lakes blue had mean cl that were less than 20 mg l which is the maximum reported value for background chloride concentrations for nova scotia environment canada health canada 2001 though recently measured cl in hrm lakes with minimally disturbed watersheds are well below this threshold at 3 6 mg l doucet 2022 and individual lakes in this category experienced seasonal cl patterns consistent with de icing salt impacts scott et al 2019 the mean concentrations are assumed to be low enough to avoid negative impacts on ecosystems associated with cl 3 3 statistical relationships road density stormwater pipe density and percent urban coverage overall accuracy 78 khat 0 56 confusion matrix table s3 of a watershed had the strongest relationships with mean lake cl of the variables explored fig 4 road density alone was able to explain 48 of the variability in mean cl in the study lakes table 1 additionally the results of lisa cluster analysis anselin local moran s i revealed some consistency between clusters formed on the basis of cl and those formed based on road density lakes watersheds that appeared in clusters of high cl in both analyses were russell lake red bridge pond cranberry lake loon lake frenchman lake whimsical lake and frog pond bell lake appeared as an outlier low cl next to many high cl in both analyses fig 5 stormwater pipe density was able to explain 55 and urban landcover was able to explain 64 of the variability in study lakes these predictor variables are highly colinear table s4 and so could not be combined in multiple linear regression two roads based models that incorporated more variables had reasonable coefficients for all variables and performed better than the roads only model but not better than the urban landcover model the expressway model explained 57 of chloride variability with ramp density having the highest coefficient followed by expressway density and then the density of other road types while the vif for each variable was acceptable the p value of most of the variables in the model did not meet significance criteria the municipal maintenance model performed only slightly better than the roads only model and explained 48 of chloride variability but produced a constant that exceeded maximum background levels the urban landcover model performed better than both other bivariate models and hand picked models in terms of both predictive r2 and corrected akaike s information coefficient aic the best performing regression model best subsets 2 included ramp density stormwater pipe density the percent of the watershed where the surficial geology was listed as rock and the distance from the midpoint of the watershed to the nearest coast as predictor variables the model accounted for 71 of variability in mean cl with all variables having acceptable vifs the standardized coefficients in this model show that the density of stormwater pipes has the greatest impact on the model estimated mean cl the model also generated a low vif and p value though the distance to coast variable produced a large p value 0 22 and the constant of the model was higher than the background range of lake cl the aic of this model was the lowest of all models explored table 1 and it was the only model that produced spatially random residuals table s5 residual plots show near normal histogram distribution and a slight fan shaped distribution when compared to fitted value figs s5 s6 therefore best subsets 2 represents the best overall model performance of the models tested 3 4 mass balance modeling the multi calibration process resulted in r2 values that ranged from 0 88 to 0 99 for training data sets and 0 69 0 99 for testing datasets table s7 in all calibrations the land use type with the highest cl loading coefficient was roads followed by urban suburban residential fig 6 the ranking of commercial industrial and rural land use types was more variable with 21 calibrations generating a higher loading coefficient for commercial industrial 23 generating the higher coefficient for rural and 6 calibrations attributing no cl loading to either of these land use types coefficient 0 00 roads were found to contribute considerably to lake cl loading in every calibration set with a minimum estimated loading coefficient of 579 g m2 yr and 15 of calibrations generated a roads loading rate above 1000 g m2 yr an order of magnitude higher than other land uses the range of estimated loading rates as taken from the interquartile range of the multiple calibration was 840 965 g m2 yr table 2 urban and suburban residential land use contributed to lake cl loading in every calibration iteration with the lowest estimated residential loading rate being 57 g m2 yr this land use produced an estimated loading rate range of 95 160 g m2 yr the commercial land use category was found to have minimal contribution to lake cl loading in more than half of the calibration iterations 26 calibrations loading rate 0 the maximum loading rate estimated was 42 g m2 yr but this was considered an outlier the reported range of estimated loading rates is 0 9 g m2 yr this land use category was arguably the most variable of those explored with parcels that ranged from large shopping centres to rural lots with large yet undeveloped portions the rural land use type generally had low loading rates in all calibrations this land use was found to have negligible contributions to cl loading in just over 15 of calibration iterations 8 calibrations with loading rate 0 the maximum observed loading rate was 6 g m2 yr and the interquartile range of loading rates generated for rural land use was 1 3 g m2 yr the coefficients found in the multi calibration process was normally distributed for road and urban suburban land use types and not normally distributed for rural and commercial land use types p 0 05 in normality test the median estimated loading rate of each land use type was found to be significantly different from that of all other types via a mann whitney test except for those of rural and commercial land uses these two land use types may not contribute significantly different cl loading to lakes when considered as a whole however a finer resolution within these categories may be required to distinguish them using the top of the interquartile loading rate range q3 values for each land use to model cl loading to all lakes watersheds produced an r2 value of 0 97 when comparing calculated observed and estimated loading rates table s8 when these cl loads are used to back calculate an estimated lake cl and this is compared with the observed mean cl a lower r2 value is achieved 0 57 the three most overpredicted lakes were cranberry lake red bridge pond and roaches pond two of these red bridge pond and cranberry lake have very high road coverage 14 but less extreme mean cl 100 mg l the three most underpredicted lakes were dent s punch bowl black duck ponds and lovett lake all three have average road coverage 5 of watershed but very high cl compared to the rest of the dataset and two of the three have very high proportions of commercially zoned area 50 additionally three of these worst predicted lakes are small lakes with highly urbanized watersheds 70 urban cranberry lake dent s punch bowl and red bridge pond using the predicted cl 58 of lakes would be put in their correct risk category red orange yellow blue but only 19 would be placed in a risk category lower than their observed cl would place them in of the 11 lakes that were estimated to belong to a lower risk category nine have 10 or their watershed area zoned as commercial 4 discussion chloride is threatening the ecological health of lakes throughout the hrm with most lakes possessing mean cl that exceed background levels and 11 of the 57 study lakes exceeding the ccme cl guideline of 120 mg l during the study period 2006 2011 recent studies have also questioned whether this guideline value is low enough to be protective of lake ecosystem function arnott et al 2020 hintz et al 2022 with cl gaining attention as a constituent that adversely affects lake food chains pushing them towards greater primary productivity and potentially promoting phytoplankton blooms further study and greater focus on the reduction of lake cl is needed hébert et al 2022 hintz et al 2016 the intent of this study was to determine the primary drivers of high cl in hrm lakes and develop generalized loading rates that can be used for land use planning the strongest single variable predictor of lake cl was the percent of urban landcover in a watershed r2 0 64 this result is consistent with the findings of dugan et al 2020 and scott et al 2019 this relationship indicates that cl in hrm lakes are affected by anthropogenic activities associated with urban land use such as road salting however the threshold of 25 urban development found by both scott et al 2019 and winter et al 2011 was not evident in this dataset 60 urban development nevertheless the relationship drawn between urban development and cl from hrm lakes was statistically significant and supports a strong connection between these characteristics though highly collinear with urban development as they are all likely acting as proxies for road salt application road density s and stormwater pipe density were also strong predictors of cl consistent with many other studies blaszczak et al 2019 dugan et al 2017 kelting et al 2012 snodgrass et al 2017 it should be noted that several of the assumptions of simple linear regression were not met in this analysis firstly neither variable was normally distributed in any of the relationships explored as all distributions were positively skewed fig s3 as well it could be argued that the observations used to quantify these relationships may not be independent as many of the study watersheds are nested the similarities between results of cluster analyses of cl and watershed road density may also indicate a relationship between these variables especially in the positive ends of their distributions towards which both variables were skewed the model that best predicted lake cl r2 0 71 included ramp density stormwater pipe density rock surficial geology and distance to the coast the first two factors are associated with urban development and road salt application while rock may represent a lack of storage in soils or regional differences in salt application rates though the addition of distance to coast to model predictors improved model performance by decreasing aics and reducing clustering of residuals caution should be taken in interpreting this as a predictor variable while it may represent higher background concentrations nearer to the coast due to atmospheric deposition many of the heavily developed urban centres are coastal and very few rural study watersheds were as near coastlines thus this model may be including distance to coast as a proxy for ruralness as all proxies for urban ness are highly correlated with stormwater pipe density fig s4 point sources of cl salt storage facilities and wastewater treatment effluent were not found to be among the strong predictors of cl though they have been significant sources of cl in other studies nava et al 2020 oswald et al 2019 tharp and allen 2020 during the calibration of the mass balance model road area was consistently assigned the highest loading rate which is consistent with the results of the regression analysis as well as previous studies and gives credibility to this estimation technique kelly et al 2008 novotny et al 2009 trowbridge et al 2010 laceby et al 2019 land use based cl loading rates that are calculated from surface water concentrations are not commonly reported in the literature one study was found that calculated and reported a rate for road area novotny and stefan 2010 and another was found that provided the data necessary to calculate loading rates for commercial and residential uses lam et al 2020 the cl loading rates we generated for road area and residential area 964 and 162 g m2 year respectively are much higher than those found or inferred from the literature 45 220 and 157 g m2 year novotny and stefan and lam et al 2010 2020 while the estimate for road area may seem comparatively high it is equivalent to 1 l of rock salt m2 year which is not unreasonable given the high provincial and municipal application rates and winter storm frequency environment canada health canada 2001 hrm 2017 though the estimate for residential areas generated here 162 g m2 yr seems only slightly higher than that found in the literature 157 g m2 yr lam et al 2020 our model attributes significantly more cl loading to the same on the ground area because the literature value includes road area and ours does not conversely the loading rate generated for commercial areas 9 g m2 year appears to be much lower than those found elsewhere 662 g m2 impervious year lam et al 2020 our rate is normalized by total zoned area much of which remained undeveloped during the study period the range of values generated for commercial land use in the multi calibration process 0 42 g m2 year highlights the variability of land cover in areas zoned as commercial in this dataset and the limitations of this method further evidence that the commercial loading rate was either poorly estimated or is highly variable is given by the high proportion of severely underestimated lakes that were largely zoned as commercial 9 of 11 however difficulty estimating commercial application rates is not unique to this study as they can vary widely between commercial properties even when normalized by impervious area lembcke et al 2017 the lowest loading rate generated was for rural land use 3 g m2 year which cannot be directly compared to published activity based rates müller and gächter 2012 this rate may be underestimated due to the assumption of no net cl retention in watersheds studies indicate that large proportions of cl can be stored in soils groundwater and surface water which can be cl sinks before these systems achieve steady state novotny et al 2009 müller and gächter 2012 dugan et al 2021 however the assessment of subsurface flow paths and if individual watersheds had come to steady state with respect to cl was outside the scope of this study more data could be collected in future investigations to confirm or refute this assumption and make necessary modifications to the loading rates other assumptions that may affect the validity of this model include i study lakes flushed at least once per year and therefore mean cl rather than cl was appropriate for determining annual loading ii study lakes were completely mixed with respect to cl during each sampling event making surface cl representative of volume weighted cl iii all land uses are salted evenly within their category and therefore the use of consistent areal rates was appropriate and iv all drainage basins are very large compared to the surface area of their lakes therefore atmospheric deposition of cl on the lakes surfaces is relatively small combining physically based and statistical modeling approaches allowed cl loads to be estimated and apportioned to different sources this methodology was especially useful in this context due to the non point source nature of the contaminant and the fact that cl is largely conservative in the environment furthermore the areal loading rates generated in this study are based on land use data that are usually readily available zoning and road networks potentially making it a more practical method in jurisdictions with few resources to track salting rates it is understood that the assumption of lakes being flushed at least once per year might not be valid in other regions in these cases the apportionment step could be combined with more complex physically based modeling techniques to determine loads like those presented in chapra et al 2009 or novotny and stefan 2010 locally appropriate loading rates that are generated could then be used in models that predict future cl like those developed by trowbridge et al 2010 obtaining regional and land use specific loading rates is important for predicting cl levels in receiving water bodies as they can vary with location operator preference and policy this has proven to be a challenge in areas with mixed land use catchments kelting et al 2012 lembcke et al 2017 moore et al 2020 but this study presents a possible solution to this issue the hrm continues to experience ongoing urban sprawl lakes are abundant in these areas and therefore more lakes are being impacted by this development doucet 2022 the cl loading rates generated in this study could be used to estimate the impacts of land use change on hrm lakes that are currently unmonitored or to assess the effect of salt management strategies e g reduced salting rates on lakes that currently have elevated cl use of q3 values generated from the calibration of the mass balance model are recommended as a conservative approach when conducting impact assessments however the commercial loading rate estimated here should be refined before it can be used in this way as cl is increasingly recognized as a contaminant of concern urban planning that considers salting impacts early in the planning process should become standard practice while cl reduction measures on existing urban landscapes should be implemented in parallel 5 conclusions many lakes in the halifax regional municipality in nova scotia canada have highly developed watersheds and are approaching or exceeding the chronic freshwater aquatic life guideline for cl these elevated levels are largely due to road salt use within the lake watersheds to effectively mitigate and manage this risk the sources of cl to lakes must be well understood in this study we show that roads in halifax regional municipality contribute the highest cl loadings to lakes compared to other types of land use and that these rates are higher than those previously estimated for other north american cities thus urban planning that minimizes road area might help protect lakes from high cl the loading coefficients for roads residential commercial and rural land uses presented here could be used to estimate cl loading to unmonitored lakes in the municipality from a policy perspective this type of analysis can be used to identify lakes that are vulnerable to impacts from road salt and help fulfill this objective in the road salt code of practice alternatively the model could also be used to predict the cl loading that a new development would add to lakes and potential risks to aquatic systems with regards to future work the loading rate estimations could be improved with additional and more recent data the loading rate estimation for rural land use may require an assessment of cl potentially stored in soils and groundwater to confirm or improve its acceptability the commercial loading rate could also be improved with finer resolution data more categories and or the omission of yet undeveloped but commercially zoned polygons to improve the accuracy of the estimated loading rate credit authorship contribution statement tessa bermarija writing original draft methodology formal analysis investigation data curation

7638,study region halifax nova scotia canada study focus many lakes in the halifax region are approaching or exceeding the chronic freshwater aquatic life guideline for chloride cl presumably due to the application of deicing salts these exceedances represent an ecological risk that requires mitigation for lakes currently experiencing high cl and preventative steps should be taken to protect lakes that will be impacted by future development in this study we paired geospatial analysis with linear regression methods to identify key factors contributing to elevated cl in halifax lakes and applied a mass balance modeling approach to estimate annual cl loading rates for dominant land uses within the region new hydrological insights for the region the watershed variables found to be most predictive of mean lake cl were the urban coverage road density and stormwater pipe density in a watershed annual cl loading rates for the four primary land use categories in the region were rural 1 3 g m2 yr commercial 0 9 g m2 yr residential 97 162 g m2 yr and roads 804 964 g m2 yr the mass balance model developed in this study could be used to predict cl loading associated with planned developments and subsequent impacts on receiving lakes graphical abstract ga1 keywords road salt chloride lakes mass balance linear regression land use data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction elevated freshwater chloride concentrations cl have emerged as a major anthropogenic environmental stressor szklarek et al 2022 increasing cl have been observed in many north american lakes with over 7500 that are estimated to have elevated cl dugan et al 2017 these elevated cl have been correlated with development and de icing salt use moore et al 2020 yao et al 2021 sorichetti et al 2022 in canada road salt has been deemed a toxic substance by environment and climate change canada eccc environment canada health canada 2001 resulting in the development of the road salt code of practice this code encourages the use of best management practices bmps the creation of salt management plans and the identification of salt vulnerable areas to combat deleterious effects eccc 2004 canadian freshwater aquatic life guidelines use a species sensitivity distribution method to assess the risk that contaminant concentrations pose to ecosystems ccme 2007 for chronic exposure to cl this guideline value is set at 120 mg l to protect 99 of species over indefinite exposure the acute guideline of 640 mg l is set to protect ecosystem function over transient exposures ccme 2011 land use planning has been identified as one of the most effective strategies to protect freshwaters from high cl without compromising road safety blaszczak et al 2019 dugan et al 2020 canadian studies considering various degrees of watershed urbanization have found a development threshold at 25 of watershed area over which cl are likely to exceed current chronic guideline levels winter et al 2011 scott et al 2019 moreover different types of development e g residential commercial and agricultural have been found to have varying de icing salt loading rates or influences on lake cl dugan et al 2020 lam et al 2020 thus explicitly incorporating cl loading potential and resulting lake impacts into urban land use planning will be critical to mitigating this environmental threat univariate and multivariate statistical techniques have been applied to explore drivers of lake cl across north america and western europe typically the application of these statistical models makes use of large spatial or temporal datasets to determine which combination of lake and or watershed characteristics best explain the variation in cl in a suite of lakes novotny et al 2008 winter et al 2011 kelting et al 2012 scott et al 2019 doucet et al 2022 using multilinear regression kelting et al 2012 found that road densities separated into classes interstate state road u s route and local were able to explain 87 of the cl variation in the lakes of adirondack park ny n 82 in halifax nova scotia scott et al 2019 found that urban development as percent watershed coverage was the most significant explanatory variable for lake cl in a group of urban lakes physically based models have also been used to estimate cl loading to a lake from different sources müller and gächter 2012 nava et al 2020 and or to estimate future lake cl chapra et al 2009 novotny and stefan 2010 dugan et al 2021 while modeling cl is relatively simple because of its conservative nature this approach usually requires several years of frequent grab sampling or high frequency conductivity data for calibration in a particular system or region chapra et al 2009 novotny and stefan 2010 winter et al 2011 nava et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 some studies have also applied a mass balance method to quantify watershed cl loads coupled with regression approaches to correlate subcatchment characteristics to the concentrations winter et al 2011 dugan et al 2021 the halifax regional municipality hrm in the canadian province of nova scotia has been rapidly urbanizing over the past 40 years with associated impacts to lake water quality doucet 2022 of particular note the combination of dense road networks and high frequency of winter weather events leads to heavy use of de icing salts to ensure winter road safety environment canada health canada 2001 spring peaks and fall minima of lake cl are typical in the hrm as most lakes have flushing rates that exceed 1 yr and watersheds have little capacity for storage in groundwater soils thus all road salts are thought to reach receiving waters within one year of their application scott et al 2019 synoptic decadal surveys of hrm lakes dating back to 1980 have measured elevated and increasing cl clement and gordon 2019 though the road salt code of practice has been in place for nearly 20 years many hrm lakes still experience spring exceedances of the chronic guideline level and some of these lakes have experienced significant increases in spring cl since 2011 doucet 2022 this pattern suggests that the recommended mitigation methods or the levels of uptake are not adequate to protect aquatic habitats approaches for predicting the impacts of future development on lake cl should be developed and calibrated at the regional scale due to differences in salting practices climate land use and hydrology the hrm is a rapidly urbanizing region with an abundance 1000 of lakes that are highly valued ecosystems in watersheds with pronounced differences in development and landscape characteristics the overall objective of this study was to address a growing need for land use planning tools needed to conduct lake cl vulnerability assessments in the hrm the specific objectives were i to quantify relationships between lake cl and watershed characteristics to evaluate whether influential factors identified in other regions are relevant in hrm and ii to produce a predictive cl loading model based on land zoning categories that may be used to assess potential development impacts on lakes during urban planning processes 2 methods 2 1 study region lakes and watersheds all study lakes and their watersheds are located 3 partially 54 fully within the hrm the study area represents a mix of urban and rural land use with the most intensive urban development occurring near the halifax and dartmouth urban centres figs 1 and s1 the study area is underlain mostly by ground moraine streamline drift and rock with smaller patches of alluvial colluvial and organic deposits table s1 the region has humid modified continental climate with a mean daily temperature of 6 6 c min 1 9 max 11 3 c receiving on average 1396 mm of precipitation yearly 1196 mm as rainfall and 221 cm of snow eccc 2010 the lakes belong to 12 secondary watersheds drainage basins that drain to the coast and 21 of the lakes in the dataset are headwater lakes estimates of background freshwater cl in the region vary greatly due to the province s large coastline and changes in deposition of salts with distance from the ocean underwood et al 1988 table s2 however the average concentration in precipitation is estimated to be 2 7 mg l for the province underwood et al 1988 and a maximum background cl of 20 mg l has been used for coastal lakes environment canada health canada 2001 chloride data was collected by the energy and environment division of hrm as part of the lake water quality monitoring program between 2006 and 2011 water samples were collected from 57 lakes in the municipality three times per year spring summer fall as surface grab samples stantec 2012 to smooth seasonal and annual variability mitigate effects of small gaps in the dataset and allow for comparison with long term guidelines mean cl over the entire study period were calculated and used for analysis summary statistics were calculated in minitab statistical software to characterize the cl dataset the degree of spatial clustering of the values was tested using both global and local indicators of spatial autocorrelation i e ansellin s moran s i in arcgis pro anselin 1995 lakes were then manually categorized into risk levels according to their mean cl as compared to the ccme long term guideline for the protection of aquatic life risk level groups were used for data visualization and model assessment only watersheds were delineated from a 5 m lidar derived digital elevation model dem where possible hrm 2013a but a provincially available 20 m dem ns l f 2006 was used for several watersheds point based delineation methods were executed using the archydro in arcgis pro with the additional step of dem reconditioning environmental systems research institute esri 2011 this step lowered and created a slight gradient towards roads and streams hrm 2012 lowered by 1 m that were considered preferential flow paths as well as linear flow paths natural resources canada 2019 lowered by 10 m to maintain hydrological connectivity through lakes watersheds were modified manually to account for stormwater infrastructure halifax water 2019 and neighboring watershed boundaries all spatial analysis was completed in the nad 1983 csrs utm zone 20 n spatial reference system epsg 2958 we considered this spatial reference system to be appropriate as it is a local projection with very small 0 04 distortions of length and area inside the utm zone snyder 1987 2 2 statistical analysis ordinary linear regression to test the relationship between the proposed explanatory variables and cl was executed in minitab software residuals from the models were tested for degree of spatial autocorrelation using the global moran s i indicator using the arcgis pro software platform all potential explanatory variables were intersected with the watersheds layer and summarized to generate a total length area occurrence for each watershed explanatory variables that are expressed as a density road density stormwater pipe density or areal percent coverage surficial geology units urban area were normalized to their watershed area variables investigated included municipally managed infrastructure roads sidewalks salt storage facilities water infrastructure stormwater pipes and outfalls ditches and wastewater treatment plants halifax water 2019 surficial geology units stea and fisher 2006 distance from the coast as watershed midpoint to nearest coastline and urban development roads were investigated as total road density road density by street class type local including those with no assigned classification major collectors minor collectors arterials and expressways ramp density in addition to street class and by maintenance type ice routes salt sand all data layers were available except for urban land use from within the study period the urban land use layer was generated through the classification of landsat 5 thematic mapper tm imagery acquired august 15th 2009 path 008 row 029 usgs 2009 in arcgis pro software using an unsupervised classification approach the unsupervised classification applied pixel based hard classification logic and employed an isodata classification algorithm with 50 target spectral classes while 50 target spectral classes is likely excessive for this classification it was necessary to reliably separate bare rock from concrete landcovers that are commonly confused spectrally classes representing urban developed areas were selected and aggregated through reclassification into an urban raster the majority filter tool was applied to remove isolated misclassified cells within larger contiguous groups of urban classified areas the classification layer was then converted from raster to a vector feature class from which lake polygons were erased to omit rocky shorelines from being included in the developed area estimate this urban layer was subset to watersheds before a confusion matrix was generated and an accuracy assessment completed using a stratified random sample of 200 points simple linear regressions i e bivariate manually selected models and models from a best subsets regression were investigated a correlation matrix was created in minitab fig s5 table s4 and variables that had the strongest relationships with cl were selected for simple linear regression in multiple linear regressions highly colinear variables were not used together two models were manually selected for multiple linear regression using variables with known or assumed relationships with road salt these models were i an expressway model using an expressway density the density of all other roads and ramp density and ii a maintenance model using the density of salted ice routes and the density of municipally maintained sidewalks best subsets regressions were used to find the most explanatory sets of variables models with the highest predictive r2 values were investigated further those with constants well outside of the background range for chloride and those that assigned negative coefficients to variables that did not make physical sense were discarded models were assessed based on predictive r2 values between predicted and observed mean cl variable p values and variance inflation factors vif were used to assess collinearity vif 5 and p 0 05 considered acceptable standardized coefficients were used to assess variable contribution and model constants and corrected akaike s information coefficients aics were used to assess model fit anselin s local moran s i was carried out in arcgis pro to identify clusters and outliers for cl and road density data to further explore any relationship between total road density and mean lake cl 2 3 mass balance modeling land area within each watershed was classified into four land use types rural commercial residential and roads fig 2 methods based on the concept of inverse loading analysis chapra et al 2009 and adapted from those presented by novotny and stefan 2010 were used to calculate a range of loading coefficients for each land use category based on its area within each watershed and the mean cl measured in the lake zoning data from 2008 was available through hrm zoned parcels do not include road area so parcels were classified into three categories rural commercial or residential based on their zone code as described in by law documents hrm 2018 parcels were categorized by zoned land use only landcover as determined from satellite imagery from within the study period was only considered in a few cases as noted below the commercial category includes industrial airports industrial parks some portions of mining operations and some processing facilities institutional hospitals government buildings and schools including greenspaces and sports fields associated with them and commercial land uses this category includes some parcels zoned for mixed use where commercial use was the primary use however home business zones were excluded the residential category includes only urban and suburban residential development this includes any residential zone code listing a minimum lot area 93 m2 10 000 ft2 zones listing separate minimum lot areas for septic and municipally serviced lots were visually estimated for average density using google earth imagery from within the study period parcels that were zoned for high to low density housing but remained undeveloped during the study period were classified as undeveloped partially developed parcels were classified as rural residential if the lot size averaged over the parcel area was estimated to be greater than 10 000 ft2 the rural land use category includes rural residential land uses residential zones with minimum lot size 10 000 ft2 and previously listed exceptions from residential resource land uses agriculture forestry fisheries and some of the associated processing facilities parks and conservation areas includes parks and some municipally owned recreational facilities including buildings and associated parking lots nature reserves wilderness areas and urban reserves that had yet not been developed during the study period some watersheds extend past hrm boundaries shubenacadie grand kinsac and mccabe lakes for these areas a land cover database ns nrr 2020 was used in lieu of zoning data these areas were found to be largely resource or rural except for some more densely developed polygons which were reclassified to residential land use a categorized zoning layer was then intersected with the study watersheds and areas were summarized by land use category to obtain an area per category per watershed an approximation of road area was obtained from the 2008 street line dataset hrm 2012 for which line length was summarized by watershed and street class type these values were then multiplied by their estimated widths from hrm design guidelines hrm 2013b to obtain an area the guidelines provide a range of road widths for different scenarios in both urban and rural contexts for this study a value from within the urban range was selected for area calculations because the urban specifications were generally narrower giving a more conservative estimate generally these values also fell within the guidelines rural range streets with null street class were assumed to be local streets and were assigned the local street width for area calculation expressway width was taken to be 12 5 m from the highway design guidelines and was rounded to the nearest half metre it should be noted highways use a narrower width as each direction is usually represented by a separate street line ns tir 2015 an annual cl load g yr was calculated for each study lake 1 m c l ρ c l q 0 where mcl is the annual cl load to a lake g yr ρcl is the mean of all samples cl g m3 for a lake and qo is the total hydraulic outflow of the lake m3 yr all lakes were assumed to flush at least once per year and to have ratios of drainage basin area to lake area sufficiently large to be able to assume that atmospheric deposition directly on a lake s surface was negligible in comparison to that on the watershed lake outflows were estimated using the method from the nova scotia user s manual for phosphorus prediction brylinsky 2004 2 q o a o p r a d r u q i a o e v where ao is the lake surface area m2 pr is the annual unit precipitation m yr ad is the drainage basin area excluding lake m2 ru is the annual unit hydraulic run off m yr qi is the upstream hydraulic input m3 yr and ev is the annual unit lake evaporation m yr precipitation and evaporation data was obtained from the eccc weather station nearest each lake s centroid table s6 the long term average canadian climate normals 1981 2010 for each parameter was used runoff values were estimated from a provincial isorunoff map fig s2 brimley et al 1985 as cited in brylinsky 2004 in all cases the centroid fell within the watershed for outflow calculations all lakes were treated as having no upstream lakes contributing to inflow qi 0 except for those receiving outflow from lake charles which drains in two directions and was assumed to drain evenly to lake micmac and lake william 50 each an annual predicted cl load was calculated for each lake using 3 m c l pred i n a lu i l lu i where mcl pred is the predicted mass of cl input to a lake annually alui is the total area of a land use category in the lake s watershed and llui is the estimated loading rate for a land use category i is an individual land use category and n is all land use categories land use loading rates were generated in excel using the solver function with the generalized reduced gradient grg nonlinear solving method the model aimed to reduce the root mean squared error rmse between the calculated annual cl loads of the lakes eq 1 and those estimated by the model eq 3 by changing the loading coefficients over successive iterations model performance was judged primarily by the r2 value between calculated lake cl loads and model estimated cl loads because the land use categories were broad and salting rates likely vary within them a range of possible cl loading rates were estimated for each category the range was obtained by performing a multi calibration by applying a selection without replacement approach a total of 50 calibration runs were conducted where in each run 67 of the data was used to fit calibrate the loading rates and the remaining 33 were used to validate the fit the loading rates for each land use category were then plotted in a box and whisker plot using r statistical software r core team 2022 and the interquartile range was taken as the lower and upper limits of the loading rate range the upper limit of the range was used to assess model performance based on estimated cl concentration and classification of lakes by risk level 3 results 3 1 lake and watershed characteristics the study lakes represent a range of lake and watershed characteristics table s1 the smallest lake in the dataset is dent s punch bowl 0 97 ha while the largest is shubenacadie grand lake 1883 ha their watersheds cover 9 8 ha and 36 917 ha respectively the watersheds studied range widely in their degree of development this variability is seen in the distribution of key indicators like road density 0 11 8 km km2 expressway density 0 2 1 km km2 percent of urban landcover 6 6 85 1 and percent coverage of rural 0 99 4 commercial 0 89 7 and urban suburban residential 0 76 3 land uses some lakes receive drainage almost exclusively by piped stormwater conveyance systems red bridge pond cranberry lake settle lake and bissett lake while some contain no stormwater piping at all apart from culverts bell desaid several watersheds extend beyond or exist outside of the municipal stormwater service boundary and do not have complete coverage of drainage infrastructure data lake echo hubley big lake black point lake sheldrake lake mccabe lake kinsac lake shubenacadie grand lake but would presumably be serviced by roadside ditches and culverts 3 2 lake chloride concentrations the distribution of mean cl among study lakes is positively skewed skewness 0 62 fig s3 with most of the mean concentrations falling below 53 mg l and a tail containing a few extremely high values the data are also spatially clustered with a global moran s i of 0 47 z score 6 24 p 0 001 and local moran s i analysis showing two significant clusters of high cl in the south of the study area on either side of halifax harbour fig s4 the lakes were divided into four groups based on mean cl fig 3 impacted lakes 11 red high risk lakes 9 orange moderate risk lakes 22 yellow and low risk lakes 15 blue the impacted red lakes had mean cl that exceed the ccme chronic guideline level of 120 mg l of the 11 lakes in this group eight had cl exceeding guideline levels for three or more consecutive sampling events indicating that these eight lakes did not comply with the chronic guideline for chloride concentration though these exceedances do not necessarily indicate negative impacts according to canadian ccme guidelines the united states environmental protection agency us epa states that systems that exceed chronic guidelines more frequently than once in any three year period are in a constant state of recovery and so are likely to be impacted us epa 2017 high risk lakes orange had mean cl between 80 mg l and 119 mg l of the nine lakes in this category eight had at least one cl measurement that exceeded the chronic guideline though sporadic exceedances of the guideline do not indicate chronic impairment of the ecosystem due to cl recent evidence suggests food webs may be impacted at levels below the chronic guideline hintz et al 2022 moderate risk yellow lakes experienced mean cl between 21 and 79 mg l none of the 22 lakes in this category possessed cl that exceeded the chronic guideline during sampling events but all of these lakes had mean cl that exceeded maximum background levels low risk lakes blue had mean cl that were less than 20 mg l which is the maximum reported value for background chloride concentrations for nova scotia environment canada health canada 2001 though recently measured cl in hrm lakes with minimally disturbed watersheds are well below this threshold at 3 6 mg l doucet 2022 and individual lakes in this category experienced seasonal cl patterns consistent with de icing salt impacts scott et al 2019 the mean concentrations are assumed to be low enough to avoid negative impacts on ecosystems associated with cl 3 3 statistical relationships road density stormwater pipe density and percent urban coverage overall accuracy 78 khat 0 56 confusion matrix table s3 of a watershed had the strongest relationships with mean lake cl of the variables explored fig 4 road density alone was able to explain 48 of the variability in mean cl in the study lakes table 1 additionally the results of lisa cluster analysis anselin local moran s i revealed some consistency between clusters formed on the basis of cl and those formed based on road density lakes watersheds that appeared in clusters of high cl in both analyses were russell lake red bridge pond cranberry lake loon lake frenchman lake whimsical lake and frog pond bell lake appeared as an outlier low cl next to many high cl in both analyses fig 5 stormwater pipe density was able to explain 55 and urban landcover was able to explain 64 of the variability in study lakes these predictor variables are highly colinear table s4 and so could not be combined in multiple linear regression two roads based models that incorporated more variables had reasonable coefficients for all variables and performed better than the roads only model but not better than the urban landcover model the expressway model explained 57 of chloride variability with ramp density having the highest coefficient followed by expressway density and then the density of other road types while the vif for each variable was acceptable the p value of most of the variables in the model did not meet significance criteria the municipal maintenance model performed only slightly better than the roads only model and explained 48 of chloride variability but produced a constant that exceeded maximum background levels the urban landcover model performed better than both other bivariate models and hand picked models in terms of both predictive r2 and corrected akaike s information coefficient aic the best performing regression model best subsets 2 included ramp density stormwater pipe density the percent of the watershed where the surficial geology was listed as rock and the distance from the midpoint of the watershed to the nearest coast as predictor variables the model accounted for 71 of variability in mean cl with all variables having acceptable vifs the standardized coefficients in this model show that the density of stormwater pipes has the greatest impact on the model estimated mean cl the model also generated a low vif and p value though the distance to coast variable produced a large p value 0 22 and the constant of the model was higher than the background range of lake cl the aic of this model was the lowest of all models explored table 1 and it was the only model that produced spatially random residuals table s5 residual plots show near normal histogram distribution and a slight fan shaped distribution when compared to fitted value figs s5 s6 therefore best subsets 2 represents the best overall model performance of the models tested 3 4 mass balance modeling the multi calibration process resulted in r2 values that ranged from 0 88 to 0 99 for training data sets and 0 69 0 99 for testing datasets table s7 in all calibrations the land use type with the highest cl loading coefficient was roads followed by urban suburban residential fig 6 the ranking of commercial industrial and rural land use types was more variable with 21 calibrations generating a higher loading coefficient for commercial industrial 23 generating the higher coefficient for rural and 6 calibrations attributing no cl loading to either of these land use types coefficient 0 00 roads were found to contribute considerably to lake cl loading in every calibration set with a minimum estimated loading coefficient of 579 g m2 yr and 15 of calibrations generated a roads loading rate above 1000 g m2 yr an order of magnitude higher than other land uses the range of estimated loading rates as taken from the interquartile range of the multiple calibration was 840 965 g m2 yr table 2 urban and suburban residential land use contributed to lake cl loading in every calibration iteration with the lowest estimated residential loading rate being 57 g m2 yr this land use produced an estimated loading rate range of 95 160 g m2 yr the commercial land use category was found to have minimal contribution to lake cl loading in more than half of the calibration iterations 26 calibrations loading rate 0 the maximum loading rate estimated was 42 g m2 yr but this was considered an outlier the reported range of estimated loading rates is 0 9 g m2 yr this land use category was arguably the most variable of those explored with parcels that ranged from large shopping centres to rural lots with large yet undeveloped portions the rural land use type generally had low loading rates in all calibrations this land use was found to have negligible contributions to cl loading in just over 15 of calibration iterations 8 calibrations with loading rate 0 the maximum observed loading rate was 6 g m2 yr and the interquartile range of loading rates generated for rural land use was 1 3 g m2 yr the coefficients found in the multi calibration process was normally distributed for road and urban suburban land use types and not normally distributed for rural and commercial land use types p 0 05 in normality test the median estimated loading rate of each land use type was found to be significantly different from that of all other types via a mann whitney test except for those of rural and commercial land uses these two land use types may not contribute significantly different cl loading to lakes when considered as a whole however a finer resolution within these categories may be required to distinguish them using the top of the interquartile loading rate range q3 values for each land use to model cl loading to all lakes watersheds produced an r2 value of 0 97 when comparing calculated observed and estimated loading rates table s8 when these cl loads are used to back calculate an estimated lake cl and this is compared with the observed mean cl a lower r2 value is achieved 0 57 the three most overpredicted lakes were cranberry lake red bridge pond and roaches pond two of these red bridge pond and cranberry lake have very high road coverage 14 but less extreme mean cl 100 mg l the three most underpredicted lakes were dent s punch bowl black duck ponds and lovett lake all three have average road coverage 5 of watershed but very high cl compared to the rest of the dataset and two of the three have very high proportions of commercially zoned area 50 additionally three of these worst predicted lakes are small lakes with highly urbanized watersheds 70 urban cranberry lake dent s punch bowl and red bridge pond using the predicted cl 58 of lakes would be put in their correct risk category red orange yellow blue but only 19 would be placed in a risk category lower than their observed cl would place them in of the 11 lakes that were estimated to belong to a lower risk category nine have 10 or their watershed area zoned as commercial 4 discussion chloride is threatening the ecological health of lakes throughout the hrm with most lakes possessing mean cl that exceed background levels and 11 of the 57 study lakes exceeding the ccme cl guideline of 120 mg l during the study period 2006 2011 recent studies have also questioned whether this guideline value is low enough to be protective of lake ecosystem function arnott et al 2020 hintz et al 2022 with cl gaining attention as a constituent that adversely affects lake food chains pushing them towards greater primary productivity and potentially promoting phytoplankton blooms further study and greater focus on the reduction of lake cl is needed hébert et al 2022 hintz et al 2016 the intent of this study was to determine the primary drivers of high cl in hrm lakes and develop generalized loading rates that can be used for land use planning the strongest single variable predictor of lake cl was the percent of urban landcover in a watershed r2 0 64 this result is consistent with the findings of dugan et al 2020 and scott et al 2019 this relationship indicates that cl in hrm lakes are affected by anthropogenic activities associated with urban land use such as road salting however the threshold of 25 urban development found by both scott et al 2019 and winter et al 2011 was not evident in this dataset 60 urban development nevertheless the relationship drawn between urban development and cl from hrm lakes was statistically significant and supports a strong connection between these characteristics though highly collinear with urban development as they are all likely acting as proxies for road salt application road density s and stormwater pipe density were also strong predictors of cl consistent with many other studies blaszczak et al 2019 dugan et al 2017 kelting et al 2012 snodgrass et al 2017 it should be noted that several of the assumptions of simple linear regression were not met in this analysis firstly neither variable was normally distributed in any of the relationships explored as all distributions were positively skewed fig s3 as well it could be argued that the observations used to quantify these relationships may not be independent as many of the study watersheds are nested the similarities between results of cluster analyses of cl and watershed road density may also indicate a relationship between these variables especially in the positive ends of their distributions towards which both variables were skewed the model that best predicted lake cl r2 0 71 included ramp density stormwater pipe density rock surficial geology and distance to the coast the first two factors are associated with urban development and road salt application while rock may represent a lack of storage in soils or regional differences in salt application rates though the addition of distance to coast to model predictors improved model performance by decreasing aics and reducing clustering of residuals caution should be taken in interpreting this as a predictor variable while it may represent higher background concentrations nearer to the coast due to atmospheric deposition many of the heavily developed urban centres are coastal and very few rural study watersheds were as near coastlines thus this model may be including distance to coast as a proxy for ruralness as all proxies for urban ness are highly correlated with stormwater pipe density fig s4 point sources of cl salt storage facilities and wastewater treatment effluent were not found to be among the strong predictors of cl though they have been significant sources of cl in other studies nava et al 2020 oswald et al 2019 tharp and allen 2020 during the calibration of the mass balance model road area was consistently assigned the highest loading rate which is consistent with the results of the regression analysis as well as previous studies and gives credibility to this estimation technique kelly et al 2008 novotny et al 2009 trowbridge et al 2010 laceby et al 2019 land use based cl loading rates that are calculated from surface water concentrations are not commonly reported in the literature one study was found that calculated and reported a rate for road area novotny and stefan 2010 and another was found that provided the data necessary to calculate loading rates for commercial and residential uses lam et al 2020 the cl loading rates we generated for road area and residential area 964 and 162 g m2 year respectively are much higher than those found or inferred from the literature 45 220 and 157 g m2 year novotny and stefan and lam et al 2010 2020 while the estimate for road area may seem comparatively high it is equivalent to 1 l of rock salt m2 year which is not unreasonable given the high provincial and municipal application rates and winter storm frequency environment canada health canada 2001 hrm 2017 though the estimate for residential areas generated here 162 g m2 yr seems only slightly higher than that found in the literature 157 g m2 yr lam et al 2020 our model attributes significantly more cl loading to the same on the ground area because the literature value includes road area and ours does not conversely the loading rate generated for commercial areas 9 g m2 year appears to be much lower than those found elsewhere 662 g m2 impervious year lam et al 2020 our rate is normalized by total zoned area much of which remained undeveloped during the study period the range of values generated for commercial land use in the multi calibration process 0 42 g m2 year highlights the variability of land cover in areas zoned as commercial in this dataset and the limitations of this method further evidence that the commercial loading rate was either poorly estimated or is highly variable is given by the high proportion of severely underestimated lakes that were largely zoned as commercial 9 of 11 however difficulty estimating commercial application rates is not unique to this study as they can vary widely between commercial properties even when normalized by impervious area lembcke et al 2017 the lowest loading rate generated was for rural land use 3 g m2 year which cannot be directly compared to published activity based rates müller and gächter 2012 this rate may be underestimated due to the assumption of no net cl retention in watersheds studies indicate that large proportions of cl can be stored in soils groundwater and surface water which can be cl sinks before these systems achieve steady state novotny et al 2009 müller and gächter 2012 dugan et al 2021 however the assessment of subsurface flow paths and if individual watersheds had come to steady state with respect to cl was outside the scope of this study more data could be collected in future investigations to confirm or refute this assumption and make necessary modifications to the loading rates other assumptions that may affect the validity of this model include i study lakes flushed at least once per year and therefore mean cl rather than cl was appropriate for determining annual loading ii study lakes were completely mixed with respect to cl during each sampling event making surface cl representative of volume weighted cl iii all land uses are salted evenly within their category and therefore the use of consistent areal rates was appropriate and iv all drainage basins are very large compared to the surface area of their lakes therefore atmospheric deposition of cl on the lakes surfaces is relatively small combining physically based and statistical modeling approaches allowed cl loads to be estimated and apportioned to different sources this methodology was especially useful in this context due to the non point source nature of the contaminant and the fact that cl is largely conservative in the environment furthermore the areal loading rates generated in this study are based on land use data that are usually readily available zoning and road networks potentially making it a more practical method in jurisdictions with few resources to track salting rates it is understood that the assumption of lakes being flushed at least once per year might not be valid in other regions in these cases the apportionment step could be combined with more complex physically based modeling techniques to determine loads like those presented in chapra et al 2009 or novotny and stefan 2010 locally appropriate loading rates that are generated could then be used in models that predict future cl like those developed by trowbridge et al 2010 obtaining regional and land use specific loading rates is important for predicting cl levels in receiving water bodies as they can vary with location operator preference and policy this has proven to be a challenge in areas with mixed land use catchments kelting et al 2012 lembcke et al 2017 moore et al 2020 but this study presents a possible solution to this issue the hrm continues to experience ongoing urban sprawl lakes are abundant in these areas and therefore more lakes are being impacted by this development doucet 2022 the cl loading rates generated in this study could be used to estimate the impacts of land use change on hrm lakes that are currently unmonitored or to assess the effect of salt management strategies e g reduced salting rates on lakes that currently have elevated cl use of q3 values generated from the calibration of the mass balance model are recommended as a conservative approach when conducting impact assessments however the commercial loading rate estimated here should be refined before it can be used in this way as cl is increasingly recognized as a contaminant of concern urban planning that considers salting impacts early in the planning process should become standard practice while cl reduction measures on existing urban landscapes should be implemented in parallel 5 conclusions many lakes in the halifax regional municipality in nova scotia canada have highly developed watersheds and are approaching or exceeding the chronic freshwater aquatic life guideline for cl these elevated levels are largely due to road salt use within the lake watersheds to effectively mitigate and manage this risk the sources of cl to lakes must be well understood in this study we show that roads in halifax regional municipality contribute the highest cl loadings to lakes compared to other types of land use and that these rates are higher than those previously estimated for other north american cities thus urban planning that minimizes road area might help protect lakes from high cl the loading coefficients for roads residential commercial and rural land uses presented here could be used to estimate cl loading to unmonitored lakes in the municipality from a policy perspective this type of analysis can be used to identify lakes that are vulnerable to impacts from road salt and help fulfill this objective in the road salt code of practice alternatively the model could also be used to predict the cl loading that a new development would add to lakes and potential risks to aquatic systems with regards to future work the loading rate estimations could be improved with additional and more recent data the loading rate estimation for rural land use may require an assessment of cl potentially stored in soils and groundwater to confirm or improve its acceptability the commercial loading rate could also be improved with finer resolution data more categories and or the omission of yet undeveloped but commercially zoned polygons to improve the accuracy of the estimated loading rate credit authorship contribution statement tessa bermarija writing original draft methodology formal analysis investigation data curation

7639,study region the nile delta egypt study focus shallow groundwater gw and soil salinity are major issues for irrigated agriculture particularly in arid and semi arid regions but more research is needed to link both issues with evapotranspiration satellite based evapotranspiration from landsat images etls has the potential to be an efficient method of estimating evapotranspiration et which can integrate etls with groundwater and soil salinity particularly in data scarce areas this study examines shallow gw and soil salinity effects on crop water use in the north nile delta during the summer season of 2017 and winter season of 2017 2018 new hydrological insights for the region the etls was moderately affected by groundwater depth gwd decreasing from 4 3 to 4 0 mm day 1 when gwd was reduced from 75 to 120 cm then increasing to 4 4 mm day 1 when gwd was increased to 140 cm the study also highlighted a significant negative correlation between etgw and gwd which increased with shallower gw 75 cm and then decreased with deeper gw the shallower the gw the greater the contribution to crop water requirements with gw contributing 1 6 and 1 7 mm day 1 for seed melon and cotton respectively while gw contributed 0 9 mm day 1 for sugar beet and 1 3 mm day 1 for wheat and clover the study s findings highlight the importance of remote sensing and gis techniques for quickly and cheaply assessing the impact of shallow gw and soil salinity on evapotranspiration over large geographic areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater remote sensing crop water use arid regions eddy covariance landsat 8 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction waterlogging and shallow groundwater gw have caused many environmental problems in many places worldwide due to poor irrigation and nonfunctional drainage systems particularly with flood irrigation ochoa et al 2007 zhang et al 2021 the groundwater depth gwd is often considered an essential factor in controlling et rates devitt et al 2002 consequently higher et rates commonly occur with the shallowest gw and vice versa nichols 1994 the relationship between et and gwd in general is not straightforward whereas a range of responses including a strong effect lafleur and roulet 1992 a moderate effect lafleur et al 2005 or no significant effect of gwd has been observed wu et al 2010 especially in peat lands moore et al 2013 this relationship is primarily influenced by several key factors including soil hydraulic properties and soil matric potential at the root zone s long boundary furthermore clay soils are vulnerable to drying and wetting cycles which can cause cracks in the soil profile and macropore flow paths that rapidly deliver water nutrients and pollutants to the water table kurtzman and scanlon 2011 although recent studies have explored the integration between remote sensing rs and surface and groundwater consumption in humid areas peña arancibia et al 2016 analysis of arid regions has not been performed yet in addition to gwd linear relationships were found between soil salinity and et cemek et al 2011 for instance ünlükara et al 2008 observed a decrease in et of an okra due to soil salinity with a threshold value of 3 48 ds m 1 in contrast the formation of soil salt crusts results in reduced soil evaporation under constant meteorological conditions zhang et al 2013 possibly due to the increase of soil albedo fujimaki et al 2006 elhaddad et al 2007 found that et values correlated well with soil salinity when they used gis and rs techniques nonetheless the integration of et gwd and soil salinity using rs in arid regions needs more attention irrigated agriculture faces several challenges that require special attention such as natural soil salinity and groundwater ding et al 2020a ding et al 2020b waterlogging and water scarcity the presence of saline groundwater in the north nile delta aquifer as a result of seawater intrusion khatib 1971 mabrouk et al 2019 and ding et al 2020 the injudicious use of poor quality groundwaters in many arid and semi arid regions for irrigation leads to the build up of salinity and or sodicity in soil and deterioration of soil health jat et al 2018 therefore el ghannam et al 2019 and ding et al 2020 observed that the highest soil and groundwater salinity and sodicity values were recorded near the sea due to seawater intrusion however to achieve proper groundwater resource management in this region it is necessary to determine the actual heterogeneity and stratigraphy of the nile delta aquifer to understand the patterns of seawater movement and mixing between fresh and saline groundwater el kiki 2018 shallow gw has long been recognised for its contribution to plant et shah et al 2007b whereas the decoupling of gw and root zone began at gwd 30 100 cm for deep rooted vegetation depending on soil texture shah et al 2007a and it can be used in situ through its capillary rise dinar et al 1991 especially as water becomes scarce shankar 2012 with modified irrigation management gw can cover part of or total crop et logsdon et al 2009 when it lies near the bottom of the root zone ayars et al 2006 the contribution of gw may reduce or even eliminate irrigation requirements without compromising crop yields nosetto et al 2009 however the contribution of gw decreases with increasing irrigation applications karimov et al 2014 and decreases by approximately 25 for every 1 m decline in the watertable xu et al 2016 as a result lowering the gw reduced the annual et by about 32 and reduced etgw by about 62 cooper et al 2006 cordeiro et al 2015 found that gw contributed 52 81 to crop et depending on the gw depth thus maintaining the gw at a shallow depth was suggested to be desirable to the plants shouse et al 2006 for instance the contribution of gw within a 40 150 cm depth met more than 65 of seasonal wheat et liu and luo 2011 and yang et al 2007 50 for alfalfa ayars et al 2009 especially with proper irrigation management additionally entire wheat maize sorghum et and 20 sunflower et were covered from gw at a depth of 50 cm kahlown et al 2005 due to the hydraulic connection between the unsaturated and saturated zones moreover the capillary rise supplied 29 of wheat et with a mean gwd of 1 5 m huo et al 2012 12 30 of soybean et with 1 5 2 0 m gwd videla mensegue et al 2015 and 33 50 for corn and wheat with gwd of 0 5 and 2 5 m respectively kang et al 2001 gw can contribute to crop et by up to 80 without affecting its yield and soil salinity prathapar and qureshi 1999a plants groundwater consumption is difficult to measure although it is a critical factor of the water budget in arid and semi arid environments loheide et al 2005 plants transpire water during the daylight hours by utilizing a portion from gw so its depth decreases similarly when transpiration significantly diminishes or ceases at night the gw will rise due to lateral and vertical gw flow mcwhorter and sunada 1977 consequently diurnal gwd fluctuations produced by diurnal fluctuations in plant et during the day and night times can be used to measure gw contribution to crop et hence in temperate climates one of the most important diurnal fluctuation inducing factors for shallow gw is the water consumption of vegetation gribovszki et al 2010 so diurnal gw fluctuation methods to calculate et and gw flow increase interest in ecohydrological studies mazur et al 2014 the et during night time etn was 7 for the entire day et24 for tall grass vegetation sugita and brutsaert 1991 4 1 of et24 for a willow tree iritz and lindroth 1994 and 14 of et24 for alfalfa as the wind speed increased malek 1992 also the etn proportion out of et24 ranged from 3 for dry land cotton to 7 2 for irrigated alfalfa tolk et al 2006 on the other hand novick et al 2009 found that plant stomata are closed at night preventing et so etn averaged 8 9 of mean daytime et etd is driven mainly by wind and vapor pressure deficit finally diurnal fluctuations in wetland water levels reflect direct gw uptake by plants where they draw down water levels during daylight hours and gw flows continuously but its elevation mostly recovers at night as gw flux replenishes the water extracted by et loheide et al 2009 however this typical pattern of groundwater fluctuation cannot be applied in some conditions for example cordeiro et al 2015 determined the redistribution pattern of water in the effective root zone subjected to irrigation and gw contribution they discovered that during periods of high et demand the soil grows drier and during periods of low et demand the soil becomes wetter groundwater depth can become deeper and may have a delay in the drying replenishment cycle during the night in poorly drained soils nevertheless to the best of our knowledge no existing study has evaluated the effect of salinity and groundwater level on et in arid regions using rs techniques therefore the main objectives of this research were to 1 estimate etls using landsat satellite data 2 evaluate the impact of gwd and soil salinity on etls and 3 evaluate the gw contribution to crop water consumption etgw 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was implemented in 200 ha of commercial fields in north nile delta egypt during the summer season of 2017 and winter season of 2017 2018 to assess the impact of gwd on crop water consumption the main cultivated crops were rice cotton maize and seed melon in the summer growing season and wheat clover and sugar beet through the winter season the area was divided into six parts as shown in fig 1 according to salinity and gwd distribution all parts in the area of study were planted with the same crops supplementary table 1 and irrigated using fresh water through traditional surface flood irrigation the area is located between 31 14 and 31 11 n and 30 58 and 31 01 e so it is subjected to the same climate conditions the mean daily temperature ranges between 4 9 and 35 1 c and the average annual precipitation is about 140 mm the area has a subsurface drainage system installed at 2 m with 25 m lateral spacing the gw ranged between 0 5 and 1 5 m below the ground surface the area is generally salt affected clayey soil and its ec values vary from 4 to 10 ds m 1 with low hydraulic conductivity soil salinity ece was estimated using ground electro magnetic meter em38 soil chemical analysis was carried out to determine ph water soluble ca2 mg2 k na cl hco3 and so4 2 in addition soil physical analysis was carried out to identify soil particle distribution water field capacity fc infiltration rate ir hydraulic conductivity hc and soil bulk density bd the chemical and physical analyses were carried out following black 1965 and jackson 1967 as shown in supplementary tables 2 and 3 soil salinity was evaluated using soil samples as well as the em38 survey according to aboelsoud and abdelrahman 2017 the em38 mk2 metre readings eca were converted to soil electrical conductivity ece by calibrating with augured soil samples from the same plots crop classifications for the two growing seasons were conducted and the land use was extracted and identified using landsat 8 satellite imagery campbell 1996 2 2 evapotranspiration 2 2 1 field based evapotranspiration eddy covariance stations were used in the field for evapotranspiration measurements etec it is a simple system and easy to use method for calculating et moorhead et al 2019 the et ec is a direct method for measuring the exchange between the atmosphere and surface in diverse environments notwithstanding its flaws particularly in terms of energy balance closure baldocchi and aubinet et al 2014 2012 thus it was used to validate remote sensing et in several previous studies e g globally michel et al 2016 asia kim et al 2012 south africa majozi et al 2017 europe hu et al 2015 north america mu et al 2011 europe and the united states miralles et al 2011 the united states xu et al 2019 and china li et al 2018 the instruments were connected to a cr6 data recorder campbell scientific and measurements were recorded every six seconds the data was then averaged or summed to provide 30 minute data 2 2 2 satellite based evapotranspiration indirect estimation of the crop evapotranspiration from remote sensing using landsat satellite images landsat 8 etls was achieved using the daily component of the energy balance equation 1 rn g h λ e where rn is the net radiation wm 2 g is the soil heat flux wm 2 h is the sensible heat flux wm 2 and λ e is the latent heat flux which is associated with the actual et wm 2 the energy balance can be written as 2 λ e ef rn g where ef is the dimensionless evaporative fraction and rn g the net available energy for et g can often be ignored for time scales of 1 day and thus λ e is a function of rn and ef only zwart et al 2010 the λ e is also defined as the ratio of actual et to the available energy 3 ef λ e rn g the triangle method rasmussen mads olander et al 2014 used in this study equation priestley and taylor 1972 4 λ e ϕ rn g γ where ϕ is the psychometric constant kpa k 1 and substituted for the p t parameter and is the slope of saturated vapor pressure at the air temperature kpa k 1 the p t parameter is assumed to be 1 26 for wetland surface conditions according to jiang and islam and tang et al 1999 2010 arasteh and tajrishy 2008 gan et al 2020 ef can be rewritten from eqs 5 6 and 7 as follows 5 ef λ e rn g ϕ γ according to the lijuan et al 2016 approach the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and land surface temperature lst triangle method fig 2 were applied to estimate the psychometric constant parameter it originated from the parameterization of jiang and islam 1999 in a simplified priestley taylor formula also a spectral radiance model and a web based atmospheric correction model can be used to successfully evaluate lst from thermal bands of landsat data aboelnour and engel 2018 regional etls and ef were estimated according to eq 6 which depends on remotely sensed data the accurate interpretation of the scatter plot resulting from remotely sensed lst and ndvi under variances in soil moisture availability and vegetation cover leads to an accurate estimation of regional etls the rate of et is influenced by vegetation and restricted by soil moisture on the dry edge as ac of the triangular space and the value of psychometric constant is the least under the same condition the landsat 8 operational land imager oli data from july 2017 to june 2018 developed the triangular space table 1 the processed remote sensing data including the ndvi and lst as radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction were used as measured data statistical analysis was conducted and the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse statistical parameters were estimated to validate the daily satellite based etls values compared to the etec 2 3 groundwater depth groundwater positions were monitored in 18 observation wells 2 inch diameter pvc pipe from july 2017 to june 2018 automatic electronic pressure level logger sensors solinst canada lt f30 m10 model 3001 were installed in nine of these wells for automated recording of gwd at one hour intervals s fig 1 also the gw diurnal cycle was determined the fluctuations in gwd for day and night times were used to predict the contribution of gw to crop water use according to the methods described by mcwhorter and sunada 1977 therefore the average gwd during the daylight time from sunrise to sunset and nighttime from sunset of a specific day to the sunrise of the following day was calculated for each well the differences between both were calculated for each month of the study period the solinst pressure sensors were submerged in the groundwater at 200 cm depth below the soil surface therefore they were not affected by air temperature fluctuations there were no differences between day and night temperatures recorded by the sensors for example air temperature during june was 340 c in the daytime and 210 c in the nighttime while the temperature recorded by the pressure sensors at the same time was 21 70 c during both day and night on the other hand the solinst logger readings were the atmospheric pressure plus the gw pressure on the sensors a solinst baro logger model 3001 ce lt f5 m1 5 was used to estimate the corrected gw by subtracting its reading from the readings of solinst pressure sensors therefore the effects of the atmospheric pressure fluctuations on sensor readings were removed to calculate the etgw value the drop in gwd measured in the monitoring wells was multiplied by the soil specific yield 12 which was calculated as the difference between the porosity and field capacity of the soil satchithanantham et al 2014 the soil specific yield is the volume of water that an unconfined aquifer releases from storage water per surface area unit of aquifer per unit decline in the gwd freeze cherry 1979 the contribution was calculated as a percent of eta based on the equivalent depth of water released by the gwd drop however these differences represented approximately the contribution of gw to crop et in the daytime etd which represents the majority about 90 of full day et et24 according gribovszki et al 2010 as follows 6 et gw gwd drop specific soil yield 1 1 for 24 hr the spatial variability of gwd for different parts within the study area was done using ordinary kriging according to eberly et al 2004 3 results 3 1 crop water requirements the estimated etls rate in the study area followed a typical seasonal pattern with a gradual rise in daily etls rates from may to august due to the peak of the growing season and crop water requirements this increase is a result of air temperature in the summer being much higher while there was a steady decrease in etls from september to february the low frequency of precipitation from mid november to february created a lower daily etls rate the results obtained from the satellite images indicated that the mean daily etls decreased significantly from 6 4 mm day 1 in july of 2017 1 6 mm day 1 in january of 2018 this was followed by a gradual increase from february to may with etls of 5 7 mm day 1 for june 2018 table 2 and fig 3 the mean value of etls was 5 9 mm day 1 in the summer season 3 6 mm day 1 in the autumn season and 2 7 mm day 1 in the winter season while it was 4 8 mm day 1 in the spring season the statistical analysis indicated that the crop evapotranspiration eta estimated using the climate data etec values for different months are close to those estimated using landsat satellite etls with a coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 89 as shown in eq 3 and eq 9 for different parts of the study area the values of etec are correlated to etls values according to r2 0 84 0 90 as shown in table 3 and fig 3 7 mmequation id eqn 1 3 2 effect of groundwater depth the gwd values varied during the study period according to the location the planted crops and the estimation time a month or the time from irrigation events the gwd in different parts of the study area ranged from 72 9 to 138 2 cm below the soil surface with a mean value of 107 4 cm table 4 the etls values were mainly affected by climatic conditions over the study area but its values in different parts were moderately affected by gwd r2 0 55 as shown in figs 4 6 also there was a correlation between etls and gwd etls value decreased from 4 3 to about 4 0 mm day 1 when gwd increased from 75 cm to about 120 cm but it increased again to about 4 4 mm day 1 with an increase in the gwd to about 140 cm therefore the highest etls value of 4 46 mm day 1 was achieved in part 1 with the deepest groundwater 138 2 cm followed by etls of 4 31 mm day 1 in part 3 with the shallowest groundwater 72 9 cm on the other hand the lowest eta values 4 08 4 09 and 4 15 mm day 1 were recorded in parts 6 2 and 5 with gwd of 135 5 110 5 and 95 3 cm respectively the healthy vegetation cover may also impact etls value in addition to gwd therefore the highest etls value was recorded in part 1 with the deepest gw and good aeration condition in the effective root zone which led to better vegetation cover in part 3 shallow gw encourages the et process while the relatively high soil salinity level 7 47 ds m 1 restricts this process so a moderate etls value was recorded 3 3 effect of soil salinity the variation in soil salinity ece in the root zone of different parts of the area is relatively small since its mean values ranged from 4 6 to 7 5 ds m 1 as shown in table 3 it can be observed that etls is slightly affected by ece while it is negatively and significantly affected by gwd as shown in the following polynomial equation 8 e t l s 15 3 0 1476 g w d 0 0005 e c e 2 r 2 0 87 the effect of soil salinity gwd and the health of the vegetation cover on etls cannot be separated easily therefore the lowest etls value 4 08 mm day 1 was recorded in part 2 with ece of 5 68 ds m 1 and moderate gwd 110 5 cm while the highest etls value of 4 37 mm day 1 was achieved in part 1 with an ece value of 4 61 ds m 1 and the deepest gw 138 2 cm 3 4 contribution of groundwater etgw is difficult to measure directly but it could be predicted using the diurnal cycle of gwd caused by et processes the gwd varied according to the time of estimation daylight or nighttime thus the etgw value can be calculated based on the diurnal cycle of gwd during the study period according to gribovszki et al 2010 the water consumption of vegetation is the most important factor affecting the diurnal fluctuation of gw in temperate climates this method assumes that the gw inflow rate is constant for the entire day loheide et al 2005 however the diurnal fluctuations of gw are due to crop water uptake because the lateral gw flux in day and night are omitted by subtracting the night gw value from its value in the daytime therefore the effect of lateral gw flux on gw contribution to etls is avoided in a typical diurnal cycle in well drained soils the gwd declines rapidly during daylight due to et by plants that extract the moisture from the root zone and utilize a portion of gw leading to deeper gw in this case gwd rebounds again during night hours due to quick lateral and vertical gw flows loheide et al 2009 in the case of the converse diurnal cycle in poorly drained soils as observed in parts 3 4 and 5 table 4 the low rate of gw flux cannot replenish this utilized moisture completely in the day time and therefore gwd is not affected significantly during the day time in this condition the utilized moisture during daytime is completely replenished by gw flux leading to deeper gw in the night cordeiro et al 2015 as shown in table 5 and supplementary figure 2 moreover table 2 shows that the variations of etgw values in the various months are related to the climate conditions gwd and planted crops deep or shallow rooted which influence the gwd and et therefore the highest etgw values ranged from 1 32 to 1 72 mm day 1 during june july october and november where the gwd was in the range of 60 75 cm the lowest etgw values ranged from 0 79 to 1 06 mm day 1 from december to may with a gwd range of 75 100 cm this means that the etgw value depended on gwd with a strong negative correlation r2 0 82 as shown in fig 7 with a gwd range of 75 100 cm or a very weak negative correlation r2 0 32 as shown in fig 8 with a gwd range of 75 100 cm hence it could be observed from the statistical relationship that the etgw value was higher with shallower gwd 75 cm and then decreased with deeper gwd to 100 cm concerning the effect of gwd in different parts of the area under study on etgw table 6 shows that parts 2 and 5 with a gwd range of 102 111 cm recorded the highest etgw values 42 1 and 44 9 respectively the lowest etgw value 22 4 was recorded in part 6 with a gwd of 136 cm there is a weak statistical correlation between etgw and gwd with different parts r2 0 32 as shown in fig 8 and table 7 which indicated that etgw depends in addition to gwd on other factors i e the planted crops and soil hydraulic conductivity regardless of the effect of time or location of measurements the etgw value was somewhat affected by the planted crops table 7 and s fig 3 indicate that summer crops achieved etgw values higher than winter crops 1 7 and 1 2 mm day 1 respectively the gw covered about 1 6 and 1 7 mm day 1 32 0 and 34 0 of water requirements of seed melon and cotton respectively while it contributed about 0 9 mm day 1 22 5 for sugar beet and 1 3 mm day 1 for clover 28 9 and wheat 37 1 4 discussion 4 1 factors affecting evapotranspiration many factors are affecting et in arid regions including but not limited to deficit irrigation and limited water resources ding and kheir et al 2021 2021 as well as climate change ali et al 2020 however additional factors of salinity and groundwater and their relationship with et has received less attention so far proving the significance of the current investigation the etls rate in this study followed a normal seasonal pattern with a gradual rise in daily etls rates through the summer growing season and a steady decrease in etls through the winter growing season the etls values were compared versus the etec values calculated directly from the data to assess their validity therefore coefficient of determination r2 simple correlation coefficient r and t test were used the statistical analysis indicated that the etls values are close to those estimated from the climate data through the values of r2 0 87 r 0 86 and p value is highly significant as shown in tables 1 and 2 also the etls values estimated in this study are similar to previous studies conducted in the same area el mowelhi and el bialy et al 1995 2009 in addition satellite based et is preferable in order to aggregate spatial heterogeneities that can bias interpretation from point measurements 4 2 effect of groundwater depth the gwd values in this study were affected by location and time of estimation during the day or at night and the planted crops table 5 the etls values were mainly affected by climatic conditions in the area but etls values in various parts were moderately affected by gwd also there was a variable trend between etls and gwd see figs 5 7 this non linear trend may be due to the etls value being affected by gwd in addition to factors such as soil gw salinity and irrigation frequency as reported by karimov et al 2014 the healthy vegetation cover may also impact etls values in addition to gwd this phenomenon is similar to that observed by prathapar and qureshi 1999b who reported that shallow gw could contribute to etls by up to 80 without affecting crop yield and soil salinization other studies also reported the variable response of etls to gwd under certain conditions for example lafleur and roulet 1992 found a strong response of et to gwd and lafleur et al 2005 found a moderate or threshold type response between them but no significant effect of gwd on etls was observed by wu et al 2010 also moore et al 2013 reported an insignificant relationship between et and gwd in peatlands 4 3 effect of soil salinity the variations in etls values for different study parts are relatively small and their values are slightly higher than those estimated by the etec method it can be observed that etls is slightly affected by eta while it is negatively and significantly affected by gwd as shown in equation 7 also the effect of soil salinity gwd and the health of the vegetation cover on etls cannot be separated easily therefore the low value of etls in some locations in the study area may be due to increased water potential in the surface layer and decreased biomass yield due to increases in the energy expended by the plant to extract water from the root zone soil other studies used the surface energy balance system sebs to estimate atmospheric turbulent fluxes and evaporative fractions by combining satellite earth observation data with meteorological information at appropriate scales with acceptable accuracy su 2002 in comparison to this study our approach linked etec observations with landsat images etls to achieve robust results these findings agree with those obtained by cemek et al 2011 who reported that the relationships between et soil salinity and yield were generally linear with increasing or decreasing tendencies also ünlükara et al 2008 observed a decrease in water consumption of okra due to soil salinity with a threshold value of 3 48 ds m 1 4 4 contribution of groundwater etgw could be predicted by the diurnal cycle of gwd caused by et processes the gwd varied according to the time of estimation daylight or nighttime in normal soil the diurnal fluctuations in water levels reflect the uptake of gw by plants where the drawdown of water levels occurs during daylight hours loheide et al 2009 however the converse diurnal cycle observed in some parts may be due to poorly drained soils expressed as a low dropdown rate of groundwater level as shown in table 7 therefore the soil became drier during high et demand in the daylight and became wetter during low et in the evening and night cordeiro et al 2015 consequently gw became deeper during the night as shown in fig 8 etgw values affected by the climate conditions gwd and the planted crops deep or shallow rooted influence the gwd and et the etgw value depended significantly on gwd with a negative correlation as shown in fig 8 the observation of chen and hu 2004 and chimner and cooper 2004 confirms these results who reported that gwd within 2 m of the soil surface might have sufficient capillary rise to supply water to plants shah et al 2007b recognized the contribution from shallow gw to plant evaporative demand as a result the decrease in et rates may be caused by lowering the gwd concerning plant roots additionally ayars et al 2006 observed that the gw near the bottom of the root zone might act as a valuable water source through the capillary rise which supplies the plant with 50 of the total et according to its depth also a weak statistical correlation between etgw and gwd for different parts fig 8 indicated that etgw depends in addition to gwd on other conflicting factors i e the planted crops and soil hydraulic conductivity the etgw value was somewhat affected by the planted crops summer crops achieved etgw values higher than those of winter crops the relatively low value of etgw with winter crops may be due to the rain events which replenish a significant part of soil moisture and can be absorbed by plant roots also most winter crops are relatively shallow rooted and in addition the evaporation rate in the winter season is relatively low thus the values of etgw with the investigated summer crops were relatively high which may be attributed to 1 cotton is deep rooted and therefore has greater ability to withdraw shallow gw and 2 seed melon needs to withdraw part of gw because its irrigation interval is relatively long and it has a dense root system shah et al 2007a confirmed that the connecting of gw and root zone depends on the soil texture and begins at gwd between 30 and 100 cm for deep rooted vegetation also remote sensing estimates of etls and the contribution of gw to etls are continuously and widely used due to understanding the relationship between the et spatial variability and groundwater level they are easy to use and save time and costs especially with open access databases although they may be less accurate than direct measurements however remote sensing based methods have some limitations because most parameters cannot be directly observed but must be calculated indirectly from satellite observations via retrieval algorithms furthermore satellite retrievals are bound to contain errors which will eventually bias the application of remote sensing necessitating their coupling with actual observations to be validated and improved 5 conclusions etls values in the study area were moderately affected by gwd the etls values were decreased when gwd increased up to 120 cm but its values increased with increasing gwd up to 140 cm evapotranspiration was significantly affected by soil salinity and groundwater depth r2 0 87 etgw values in different months depended mainly on gwd with a negative correlation r2 0 61 and about 1 2 mm day 1 of the crop water use was supplied from shallow gw 90 cm statistical analysis demonstrated that shallow gw contributed significantly to various crops water use with noticeable differences in rates the summer crops achieved higher values of etgw than those of winter crops by 29 4 the gw contributed 1 7 and 1 6 mm day 1 of cotton and seed melon crop water requirements respectively while it contributed 0 9 mm day 1 for sugar beet and 1 3 mm day 1 for both wheat and clover the study also showed that remote sensing and gis techniques are valuable tools for evaluating the influence of shallow gw and soil salinity on etls and etgw in large geographic areas with relatively low costs also both remote sensing estimates of etls and the contribution of gw to etls are widely used due to their applicability and relationship representation between et spatial variability and groundwater level even though these techniques may be less accurate than direct measurements further the statistical analysis indicated that the etls values are correlated to those estimated directly from climate data credit authorship contribution statement

7639,study region the nile delta egypt study focus shallow groundwater gw and soil salinity are major issues for irrigated agriculture particularly in arid and semi arid regions but more research is needed to link both issues with evapotranspiration satellite based evapotranspiration from landsat images etls has the potential to be an efficient method of estimating evapotranspiration et which can integrate etls with groundwater and soil salinity particularly in data scarce areas this study examines shallow gw and soil salinity effects on crop water use in the north nile delta during the summer season of 2017 and winter season of 2017 2018 new hydrological insights for the region the etls was moderately affected by groundwater depth gwd decreasing from 4 3 to 4 0 mm day 1 when gwd was reduced from 75 to 120 cm then increasing to 4 4 mm day 1 when gwd was increased to 140 cm the study also highlighted a significant negative correlation between etgw and gwd which increased with shallower gw 75 cm and then decreased with deeper gw the shallower the gw the greater the contribution to crop water requirements with gw contributing 1 6 and 1 7 mm day 1 for seed melon and cotton respectively while gw contributed 0 9 mm day 1 for sugar beet and 1 3 mm day 1 for wheat and clover the study s findings highlight the importance of remote sensing and gis techniques for quickly and cheaply assessing the impact of shallow gw and soil salinity on evapotranspiration over large geographic areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater remote sensing crop water use arid regions eddy covariance landsat 8 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction waterlogging and shallow groundwater gw have caused many environmental problems in many places worldwide due to poor irrigation and nonfunctional drainage systems particularly with flood irrigation ochoa et al 2007 zhang et al 2021 the groundwater depth gwd is often considered an essential factor in controlling et rates devitt et al 2002 consequently higher et rates commonly occur with the shallowest gw and vice versa nichols 1994 the relationship between et and gwd in general is not straightforward whereas a range of responses including a strong effect lafleur and roulet 1992 a moderate effect lafleur et al 2005 or no significant effect of gwd has been observed wu et al 2010 especially in peat lands moore et al 2013 this relationship is primarily influenced by several key factors including soil hydraulic properties and soil matric potential at the root zone s long boundary furthermore clay soils are vulnerable to drying and wetting cycles which can cause cracks in the soil profile and macropore flow paths that rapidly deliver water nutrients and pollutants to the water table kurtzman and scanlon 2011 although recent studies have explored the integration between remote sensing rs and surface and groundwater consumption in humid areas peña arancibia et al 2016 analysis of arid regions has not been performed yet in addition to gwd linear relationships were found between soil salinity and et cemek et al 2011 for instance ünlükara et al 2008 observed a decrease in et of an okra due to soil salinity with a threshold value of 3 48 ds m 1 in contrast the formation of soil salt crusts results in reduced soil evaporation under constant meteorological conditions zhang et al 2013 possibly due to the increase of soil albedo fujimaki et al 2006 elhaddad et al 2007 found that et values correlated well with soil salinity when they used gis and rs techniques nonetheless the integration of et gwd and soil salinity using rs in arid regions needs more attention irrigated agriculture faces several challenges that require special attention such as natural soil salinity and groundwater ding et al 2020a ding et al 2020b waterlogging and water scarcity the presence of saline groundwater in the north nile delta aquifer as a result of seawater intrusion khatib 1971 mabrouk et al 2019 and ding et al 2020 the injudicious use of poor quality groundwaters in many arid and semi arid regions for irrigation leads to the build up of salinity and or sodicity in soil and deterioration of soil health jat et al 2018 therefore el ghannam et al 2019 and ding et al 2020 observed that the highest soil and groundwater salinity and sodicity values were recorded near the sea due to seawater intrusion however to achieve proper groundwater resource management in this region it is necessary to determine the actual heterogeneity and stratigraphy of the nile delta aquifer to understand the patterns of seawater movement and mixing between fresh and saline groundwater el kiki 2018 shallow gw has long been recognised for its contribution to plant et shah et al 2007b whereas the decoupling of gw and root zone began at gwd 30 100 cm for deep rooted vegetation depending on soil texture shah et al 2007a and it can be used in situ through its capillary rise dinar et al 1991 especially as water becomes scarce shankar 2012 with modified irrigation management gw can cover part of or total crop et logsdon et al 2009 when it lies near the bottom of the root zone ayars et al 2006 the contribution of gw may reduce or even eliminate irrigation requirements without compromising crop yields nosetto et al 2009 however the contribution of gw decreases with increasing irrigation applications karimov et al 2014 and decreases by approximately 25 for every 1 m decline in the watertable xu et al 2016 as a result lowering the gw reduced the annual et by about 32 and reduced etgw by about 62 cooper et al 2006 cordeiro et al 2015 found that gw contributed 52 81 to crop et depending on the gw depth thus maintaining the gw at a shallow depth was suggested to be desirable to the plants shouse et al 2006 for instance the contribution of gw within a 40 150 cm depth met more than 65 of seasonal wheat et liu and luo 2011 and yang et al 2007 50 for alfalfa ayars et al 2009 especially with proper irrigation management additionally entire wheat maize sorghum et and 20 sunflower et were covered from gw at a depth of 50 cm kahlown et al 2005 due to the hydraulic connection between the unsaturated and saturated zones moreover the capillary rise supplied 29 of wheat et with a mean gwd of 1 5 m huo et al 2012 12 30 of soybean et with 1 5 2 0 m gwd videla mensegue et al 2015 and 33 50 for corn and wheat with gwd of 0 5 and 2 5 m respectively kang et al 2001 gw can contribute to crop et by up to 80 without affecting its yield and soil salinity prathapar and qureshi 1999a plants groundwater consumption is difficult to measure although it is a critical factor of the water budget in arid and semi arid environments loheide et al 2005 plants transpire water during the daylight hours by utilizing a portion from gw so its depth decreases similarly when transpiration significantly diminishes or ceases at night the gw will rise due to lateral and vertical gw flow mcwhorter and sunada 1977 consequently diurnal gwd fluctuations produced by diurnal fluctuations in plant et during the day and night times can be used to measure gw contribution to crop et hence in temperate climates one of the most important diurnal fluctuation inducing factors for shallow gw is the water consumption of vegetation gribovszki et al 2010 so diurnal gw fluctuation methods to calculate et and gw flow increase interest in ecohydrological studies mazur et al 2014 the et during night time etn was 7 for the entire day et24 for tall grass vegetation sugita and brutsaert 1991 4 1 of et24 for a willow tree iritz and lindroth 1994 and 14 of et24 for alfalfa as the wind speed increased malek 1992 also the etn proportion out of et24 ranged from 3 for dry land cotton to 7 2 for irrigated alfalfa tolk et al 2006 on the other hand novick et al 2009 found that plant stomata are closed at night preventing et so etn averaged 8 9 of mean daytime et etd is driven mainly by wind and vapor pressure deficit finally diurnal fluctuations in wetland water levels reflect direct gw uptake by plants where they draw down water levels during daylight hours and gw flows continuously but its elevation mostly recovers at night as gw flux replenishes the water extracted by et loheide et al 2009 however this typical pattern of groundwater fluctuation cannot be applied in some conditions for example cordeiro et al 2015 determined the redistribution pattern of water in the effective root zone subjected to irrigation and gw contribution they discovered that during periods of high et demand the soil grows drier and during periods of low et demand the soil becomes wetter groundwater depth can become deeper and may have a delay in the drying replenishment cycle during the night in poorly drained soils nevertheless to the best of our knowledge no existing study has evaluated the effect of salinity and groundwater level on et in arid regions using rs techniques therefore the main objectives of this research were to 1 estimate etls using landsat satellite data 2 evaluate the impact of gwd and soil salinity on etls and 3 evaluate the gw contribution to crop water consumption etgw 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was implemented in 200 ha of commercial fields in north nile delta egypt during the summer season of 2017 and winter season of 2017 2018 to assess the impact of gwd on crop water consumption the main cultivated crops were rice cotton maize and seed melon in the summer growing season and wheat clover and sugar beet through the winter season the area was divided into six parts as shown in fig 1 according to salinity and gwd distribution all parts in the area of study were planted with the same crops supplementary table 1 and irrigated using fresh water through traditional surface flood irrigation the area is located between 31 14 and 31 11 n and 30 58 and 31 01 e so it is subjected to the same climate conditions the mean daily temperature ranges between 4 9 and 35 1 c and the average annual precipitation is about 140 mm the area has a subsurface drainage system installed at 2 m with 25 m lateral spacing the gw ranged between 0 5 and 1 5 m below the ground surface the area is generally salt affected clayey soil and its ec values vary from 4 to 10 ds m 1 with low hydraulic conductivity soil salinity ece was estimated using ground electro magnetic meter em38 soil chemical analysis was carried out to determine ph water soluble ca2 mg2 k na cl hco3 and so4 2 in addition soil physical analysis was carried out to identify soil particle distribution water field capacity fc infiltration rate ir hydraulic conductivity hc and soil bulk density bd the chemical and physical analyses were carried out following black 1965 and jackson 1967 as shown in supplementary tables 2 and 3 soil salinity was evaluated using soil samples as well as the em38 survey according to aboelsoud and abdelrahman 2017 the em38 mk2 metre readings eca were converted to soil electrical conductivity ece by calibrating with augured soil samples from the same plots crop classifications for the two growing seasons were conducted and the land use was extracted and identified using landsat 8 satellite imagery campbell 1996 2 2 evapotranspiration 2 2 1 field based evapotranspiration eddy covariance stations were used in the field for evapotranspiration measurements etec it is a simple system and easy to use method for calculating et moorhead et al 2019 the et ec is a direct method for measuring the exchange between the atmosphere and surface in diverse environments notwithstanding its flaws particularly in terms of energy balance closure baldocchi and aubinet et al 2014 2012 thus it was used to validate remote sensing et in several previous studies e g globally michel et al 2016 asia kim et al 2012 south africa majozi et al 2017 europe hu et al 2015 north america mu et al 2011 europe and the united states miralles et al 2011 the united states xu et al 2019 and china li et al 2018 the instruments were connected to a cr6 data recorder campbell scientific and measurements were recorded every six seconds the data was then averaged or summed to provide 30 minute data 2 2 2 satellite based evapotranspiration indirect estimation of the crop evapotranspiration from remote sensing using landsat satellite images landsat 8 etls was achieved using the daily component of the energy balance equation 1 rn g h λ e where rn is the net radiation wm 2 g is the soil heat flux wm 2 h is the sensible heat flux wm 2 and λ e is the latent heat flux which is associated with the actual et wm 2 the energy balance can be written as 2 λ e ef rn g where ef is the dimensionless evaporative fraction and rn g the net available energy for et g can often be ignored for time scales of 1 day and thus λ e is a function of rn and ef only zwart et al 2010 the λ e is also defined as the ratio of actual et to the available energy 3 ef λ e rn g the triangle method rasmussen mads olander et al 2014 used in this study equation priestley and taylor 1972 4 λ e ϕ rn g γ where ϕ is the psychometric constant kpa k 1 and substituted for the p t parameter and is the slope of saturated vapor pressure at the air temperature kpa k 1 the p t parameter is assumed to be 1 26 for wetland surface conditions according to jiang and islam and tang et al 1999 2010 arasteh and tajrishy 2008 gan et al 2020 ef can be rewritten from eqs 5 6 and 7 as follows 5 ef λ e rn g ϕ γ according to the lijuan et al 2016 approach the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and land surface temperature lst triangle method fig 2 were applied to estimate the psychometric constant parameter it originated from the parameterization of jiang and islam 1999 in a simplified priestley taylor formula also a spectral radiance model and a web based atmospheric correction model can be used to successfully evaluate lst from thermal bands of landsat data aboelnour and engel 2018 regional etls and ef were estimated according to eq 6 which depends on remotely sensed data the accurate interpretation of the scatter plot resulting from remotely sensed lst and ndvi under variances in soil moisture availability and vegetation cover leads to an accurate estimation of regional etls the rate of et is influenced by vegetation and restricted by soil moisture on the dry edge as ac of the triangular space and the value of psychometric constant is the least under the same condition the landsat 8 operational land imager oli data from july 2017 to june 2018 developed the triangular space table 1 the processed remote sensing data including the ndvi and lst as radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction were used as measured data statistical analysis was conducted and the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse statistical parameters were estimated to validate the daily satellite based etls values compared to the etec 2 3 groundwater depth groundwater positions were monitored in 18 observation wells 2 inch diameter pvc pipe from july 2017 to june 2018 automatic electronic pressure level logger sensors solinst canada lt f30 m10 model 3001 were installed in nine of these wells for automated recording of gwd at one hour intervals s fig 1 also the gw diurnal cycle was determined the fluctuations in gwd for day and night times were used to predict the contribution of gw to crop water use according to the methods described by mcwhorter and sunada 1977 therefore the average gwd during the daylight time from sunrise to sunset and nighttime from sunset of a specific day to the sunrise of the following day was calculated for each well the differences between both were calculated for each month of the study period the solinst pressure sensors were submerged in the groundwater at 200 cm depth below the soil surface therefore they were not affected by air temperature fluctuations there were no differences between day and night temperatures recorded by the sensors for example air temperature during june was 340 c in the daytime and 210 c in the nighttime while the temperature recorded by the pressure sensors at the same time was 21 70 c during both day and night on the other hand the solinst logger readings were the atmospheric pressure plus the gw pressure on the sensors a solinst baro logger model 3001 ce lt f5 m1 5 was used to estimate the corrected gw by subtracting its reading from the readings of solinst pressure sensors therefore the effects of the atmospheric pressure fluctuations on sensor readings were removed to calculate the etgw value the drop in gwd measured in the monitoring wells was multiplied by the soil specific yield 12 which was calculated as the difference between the porosity and field capacity of the soil satchithanantham et al 2014 the soil specific yield is the volume of water that an unconfined aquifer releases from storage water per surface area unit of aquifer per unit decline in the gwd freeze cherry 1979 the contribution was calculated as a percent of eta based on the equivalent depth of water released by the gwd drop however these differences represented approximately the contribution of gw to crop et in the daytime etd which represents the majority about 90 of full day et et24 according gribovszki et al 2010 as follows 6 et gw gwd drop specific soil yield 1 1 for 24 hr the spatial variability of gwd for different parts within the study area was done using ordinary kriging according to eberly et al 2004 3 results 3 1 crop water requirements the estimated etls rate in the study area followed a typical seasonal pattern with a gradual rise in daily etls rates from may to august due to the peak of the growing season and crop water requirements this increase is a result of air temperature in the summer being much higher while there was a steady decrease in etls from september to february the low frequency of precipitation from mid november to february created a lower daily etls rate the results obtained from the satellite images indicated that the mean daily etls decreased significantly from 6 4 mm day 1 in july of 2017 1 6 mm day 1 in january of 2018 this was followed by a gradual increase from february to may with etls of 5 7 mm day 1 for june 2018 table 2 and fig 3 the mean value of etls was 5 9 mm day 1 in the summer season 3 6 mm day 1 in the autumn season and 2 7 mm day 1 in the winter season while it was 4 8 mm day 1 in the spring season the statistical analysis indicated that the crop evapotranspiration eta estimated using the climate data etec values for different months are close to those estimated using landsat satellite etls with a coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 89 as shown in eq 3 and eq 9 for different parts of the study area the values of etec are correlated to etls values according to r2 0 84 0 90 as shown in table 3 and fig 3 7 mmequation id eqn 1 3 2 effect of groundwater depth the gwd values varied during the study period according to the location the planted crops and the estimation time a month or the time from irrigation events the gwd in different parts of the study area ranged from 72 9 to 138 2 cm below the soil surface with a mean value of 107 4 cm table 4 the etls values were mainly affected by climatic conditions over the study area but its values in different parts were moderately affected by gwd r2 0 55 as shown in figs 4 6 also there was a correlation between etls and gwd etls value decreased from 4 3 to about 4 0 mm day 1 when gwd increased from 75 cm to about 120 cm but it increased again to about 4 4 mm day 1 with an increase in the gwd to about 140 cm therefore the highest etls value of 4 46 mm day 1 was achieved in part 1 with the deepest groundwater 138 2 cm followed by etls of 4 31 mm day 1 in part 3 with the shallowest groundwater 72 9 cm on the other hand the lowest eta values 4 08 4 09 and 4 15 mm day 1 were recorded in parts 6 2 and 5 with gwd of 135 5 110 5 and 95 3 cm respectively the healthy vegetation cover may also impact etls value in addition to gwd therefore the highest etls value was recorded in part 1 with the deepest gw and good aeration condition in the effective root zone which led to better vegetation cover in part 3 shallow gw encourages the et process while the relatively high soil salinity level 7 47 ds m 1 restricts this process so a moderate etls value was recorded 3 3 effect of soil salinity the variation in soil salinity ece in the root zone of different parts of the area is relatively small since its mean values ranged from 4 6 to 7 5 ds m 1 as shown in table 3 it can be observed that etls is slightly affected by ece while it is negatively and significantly affected by gwd as shown in the following polynomial equation 8 e t l s 15 3 0 1476 g w d 0 0005 e c e 2 r 2 0 87 the effect of soil salinity gwd and the health of the vegetation cover on etls cannot be separated easily therefore the lowest etls value 4 08 mm day 1 was recorded in part 2 with ece of 5 68 ds m 1 and moderate gwd 110 5 cm while the highest etls value of 4 37 mm day 1 was achieved in part 1 with an ece value of 4 61 ds m 1 and the deepest gw 138 2 cm 3 4 contribution of groundwater etgw is difficult to measure directly but it could be predicted using the diurnal cycle of gwd caused by et processes the gwd varied according to the time of estimation daylight or nighttime thus the etgw value can be calculated based on the diurnal cycle of gwd during the study period according to gribovszki et al 2010 the water consumption of vegetation is the most important factor affecting the diurnal fluctuation of gw in temperate climates this method assumes that the gw inflow rate is constant for the entire day loheide et al 2005 however the diurnal fluctuations of gw are due to crop water uptake because the lateral gw flux in day and night are omitted by subtracting the night gw value from its value in the daytime therefore the effect of lateral gw flux on gw contribution to etls is avoided in a typical diurnal cycle in well drained soils the gwd declines rapidly during daylight due to et by plants that extract the moisture from the root zone and utilize a portion of gw leading to deeper gw in this case gwd rebounds again during night hours due to quick lateral and vertical gw flows loheide et al 2009 in the case of the converse diurnal cycle in poorly drained soils as observed in parts 3 4 and 5 table 4 the low rate of gw flux cannot replenish this utilized moisture completely in the day time and therefore gwd is not affected significantly during the day time in this condition the utilized moisture during daytime is completely replenished by gw flux leading to deeper gw in the night cordeiro et al 2015 as shown in table 5 and supplementary figure 2 moreover table 2 shows that the variations of etgw values in the various months are related to the climate conditions gwd and planted crops deep or shallow rooted which influence the gwd and et therefore the highest etgw values ranged from 1 32 to 1 72 mm day 1 during june july october and november where the gwd was in the range of 60 75 cm the lowest etgw values ranged from 0 79 to 1 06 mm day 1 from december to may with a gwd range of 75 100 cm this means that the etgw value depended on gwd with a strong negative correlation r2 0 82 as shown in fig 7 with a gwd range of 75 100 cm or a very weak negative correlation r2 0 32 as shown in fig 8 with a gwd range of 75 100 cm hence it could be observed from the statistical relationship that the etgw value was higher with shallower gwd 75 cm and then decreased with deeper gwd to 100 cm concerning the effect of gwd in different parts of the area under study on etgw table 6 shows that parts 2 and 5 with a gwd range of 102 111 cm recorded the highest etgw values 42 1 and 44 9 respectively the lowest etgw value 22 4 was recorded in part 6 with a gwd of 136 cm there is a weak statistical correlation between etgw and gwd with different parts r2 0 32 as shown in fig 8 and table 7 which indicated that etgw depends in addition to gwd on other factors i e the planted crops and soil hydraulic conductivity regardless of the effect of time or location of measurements the etgw value was somewhat affected by the planted crops table 7 and s fig 3 indicate that summer crops achieved etgw values higher than winter crops 1 7 and 1 2 mm day 1 respectively the gw covered about 1 6 and 1 7 mm day 1 32 0 and 34 0 of water requirements of seed melon and cotton respectively while it contributed about 0 9 mm day 1 22 5 for sugar beet and 1 3 mm day 1 for clover 28 9 and wheat 37 1 4 discussion 4 1 factors affecting evapotranspiration many factors are affecting et in arid regions including but not limited to deficit irrigation and limited water resources ding and kheir et al 2021 2021 as well as climate change ali et al 2020 however additional factors of salinity and groundwater and their relationship with et has received less attention so far proving the significance of the current investigation the etls rate in this study followed a normal seasonal pattern with a gradual rise in daily etls rates through the summer growing season and a steady decrease in etls through the winter growing season the etls values were compared versus the etec values calculated directly from the data to assess their validity therefore coefficient of determination r2 simple correlation coefficient r and t test were used the statistical analysis indicated that the etls values are close to those estimated from the climate data through the values of r2 0 87 r 0 86 and p value is highly significant as shown in tables 1 and 2 also the etls values estimated in this study are similar to previous studies conducted in the same area el mowelhi and el bialy et al 1995 2009 in addition satellite based et is preferable in order to aggregate spatial heterogeneities that can bias interpretation from point measurements 4 2 effect of groundwater depth the gwd values in this study were affected by location and time of estimation during the day or at night and the planted crops table 5 the etls values were mainly affected by climatic conditions in the area but etls values in various parts were moderately affected by gwd also there was a variable trend between etls and gwd see figs 5 7 this non linear trend may be due to the etls value being affected by gwd in addition to factors such as soil gw salinity and irrigation frequency as reported by karimov et al 2014 the healthy vegetation cover may also impact etls values in addition to gwd this phenomenon is similar to that observed by prathapar and qureshi 1999b who reported that shallow gw could contribute to etls by up to 80 without affecting crop yield and soil salinization other studies also reported the variable response of etls to gwd under certain conditions for example lafleur and roulet 1992 found a strong response of et to gwd and lafleur et al 2005 found a moderate or threshold type response between them but no significant effect of gwd on etls was observed by wu et al 2010 also moore et al 2013 reported an insignificant relationship between et and gwd in peatlands 4 3 effect of soil salinity the variations in etls values for different study parts are relatively small and their values are slightly higher than those estimated by the etec method it can be observed that etls is slightly affected by eta while it is negatively and significantly affected by gwd as shown in equation 7 also the effect of soil salinity gwd and the health of the vegetation cover on etls cannot be separated easily therefore the low value of etls in some locations in the study area may be due to increased water potential in the surface layer and decreased biomass yield due to increases in the energy expended by the plant to extract water from the root zone soil other studies used the surface energy balance system sebs to estimate atmospheric turbulent fluxes and evaporative fractions by combining satellite earth observation data with meteorological information at appropriate scales with acceptable accuracy su 2002 in comparison to this study our approach linked etec observations with landsat images etls to achieve robust results these findings agree with those obtained by cemek et al 2011 who reported that the relationships between et soil salinity and yield were generally linear with increasing or decreasing tendencies also ünlükara et al 2008 observed a decrease in water consumption of okra due to soil salinity with a threshold value of 3 48 ds m 1 4 4 contribution of groundwater etgw could be predicted by the diurnal cycle of gwd caused by et processes the gwd varied according to the time of estimation daylight or nighttime in normal soil the diurnal fluctuations in water levels reflect the uptake of gw by plants where the drawdown of water levels occurs during daylight hours loheide et al 2009 however the converse diurnal cycle observed in some parts may be due to poorly drained soils expressed as a low dropdown rate of groundwater level as shown in table 7 therefore the soil became drier during high et demand in the daylight and became wetter during low et in the evening and night cordeiro et al 2015 consequently gw became deeper during the night as shown in fig 8 etgw values affected by the climate conditions gwd and the planted crops deep or shallow rooted influence the gwd and et the etgw value depended significantly on gwd with a negative correlation as shown in fig 8 the observation of chen and hu 2004 and chimner and cooper 2004 confirms these results who reported that gwd within 2 m of the soil surface might have sufficient capillary rise to supply water to plants shah et al 2007b recognized the contribution from shallow gw to plant evaporative demand as a result the decrease in et rates may be caused by lowering the gwd concerning plant roots additionally ayars et al 2006 observed that the gw near the bottom of the root zone might act as a valuable water source through the capillary rise which supplies the plant with 50 of the total et according to its depth also a weak statistical correlation between etgw and gwd for different parts fig 8 indicated that etgw depends in addition to gwd on other conflicting factors i e the planted crops and soil hydraulic conductivity the etgw value was somewhat affected by the planted crops summer crops achieved etgw values higher than those of winter crops the relatively low value of etgw with winter crops may be due to the rain events which replenish a significant part of soil moisture and can be absorbed by plant roots also most winter crops are relatively shallow rooted and in addition the evaporation rate in the winter season is relatively low thus the values of etgw with the investigated summer crops were relatively high which may be attributed to 1 cotton is deep rooted and therefore has greater ability to withdraw shallow gw and 2 seed melon needs to withdraw part of gw because its irrigation interval is relatively long and it has a dense root system shah et al 2007a confirmed that the connecting of gw and root zone depends on the soil texture and begins at gwd between 30 and 100 cm for deep rooted vegetation also remote sensing estimates of etls and the contribution of gw to etls are continuously and widely used due to understanding the relationship between the et spatial variability and groundwater level they are easy to use and save time and costs especially with open access databases although they may be less accurate than direct measurements however remote sensing based methods have some limitations because most parameters cannot be directly observed but must be calculated indirectly from satellite observations via retrieval algorithms furthermore satellite retrievals are bound to contain errors which will eventually bias the application of remote sensing necessitating their coupling with actual observations to be validated and improved 5 conclusions etls values in the study area were moderately affected by gwd the etls values were decreased when gwd increased up to 120 cm but its values increased with increasing gwd up to 140 cm evapotranspiration was significantly affected by soil salinity and groundwater depth r2 0 87 etgw values in different months depended mainly on gwd with a negative correlation r2 0 61 and about 1 2 mm day 1 of the crop water use was supplied from shallow gw 90 cm statistical analysis demonstrated that shallow gw contributed significantly to various crops water use with noticeable differences in rates the summer crops achieved higher values of etgw than those of winter crops by 29 4 the gw contributed 1 7 and 1 6 mm day 1 of cotton and seed melon crop water requirements respectively while it contributed 0 9 mm day 1 for sugar beet and 1 3 mm day 1 for both wheat and clover the study also showed that remote sensing and gis techniques are valuable tools for evaluating the influence of shallow gw and soil salinity on etls and etgw in large geographic areas with relatively low costs also both remote sensing estimates of etls and the contribution of gw to etls are widely used due to their applicability and relationship representation between et spatial variability and groundwater level even though these techniques may be less accurate than direct measurements further the statistical analysis indicated that the etls values are correlated to those estimated directly from climate data credit authorship contribution statement
