5025,baseflow or the groundwater component of streamflow is an important source of water for several applications from increasing demands on freshwater resources to ecosystem health despite its relevance our understanding of the processes driving baseflow and its interannual variability is limited in this study we focus on 458 u s geological survey streamflow gauges that have at least 50 years of daily data we use a statistical modeling framework to select a set of predictors that represent the role of climate i e precipitation temperature and antecedent wetness and land use harvested acres of corn and soybeans the models are able to describe well the variability in monthly baseflow across the region with an average correlation coefficient between the observational records and the median of the fitted distribution of 0 70 among all months our results indicate that precipitation and antecedent wetness are the strongest predictors where the latter was selected the most often temperature is an important predictor during the spring when snow related processes are the most relevant agriculture was frequently selected in the cornbelt region during the growing season from march to july the results of this study can inform future watershed management that sustains low flows and improves water quality 1 introduction baseflow is the portion of streamflow discharged from groundwater or other delayed sources it is an important water resource because it sustains streamflow between precipitation events or periods of drought and it has potential consequences for water quality kang et al 2008 schilling and lutz 2004 schilling and zhang 2004 although we have progressed significantly in our understanding of the changes in streamflow we still do not fully understand what factors influence baseflow baseflow varies regionally and spatially because it is affected by differences in climate topography surface water groundwater and human activities price 2011 santhi et al 2008 watershed characteristics such as geology and topography that promote infiltration and recharge have been shown to be important for sustaining baseflow price et al 2011 zimmer and gannon 2018 on the other hand climate factors e g precipitation and temperature influence baseflow through water availability evapotranspiration rates and the timing of snowmelt runoff ahiablame et al 2017a cadol et al 2012 gupta et al 2018 mishra et al 2010 slater and villarini 2017 although climate controls the availability and timing of discharge previous research has shown that climate alone cannot explain observed changes in baseflow raymond et al 2008 schilling and libra 2003 tomer and schilling 2009 often land use and land cover influence soil and topographic characteristics that dictate whether precipitation is distributed as either runoff or recharge while previous studies identified changes in baseflow across large areas of the midwest ahiablame et al 2017a ayers et al 2019 ficklin et al 2016 zhang and schilling 2006 it is still unclear what factors are driving these changes in the midwest natural vegetation of grasslands wetlands and prairies have been converted to maize and soybean row crops e g frans et al 2013 this area also known as the cornbelt region is one of the highest yielding global agricultural areas for corn nikiel and eltahir 2019 studies have identified agricultural land use as an important driver for increases in baseflow across the region ahiablame et al 2017a ayers et al 2019 schilling 2005 schilling and libra 2003 for a watershed in iowa schilling and libra 2003 argued that improved agricultural management practices in the second half of the 20th century contributed to increasing baseflow in addition tile drainage has been a crucial part of agricultural systems tiles remove excess water from traditional wetlands which provides a nutrient rich environment for corn and soybean production e g kelly et al 2016 while artificial drainage has changed the hydrologic regime across agricultural landscapes and contributes to baseflow arenas amado et al 2017 basu et al 2012 blann et al 2009 schilling et al 2019 the extent of its control remains unknown another component of land use change has been groundwater pumping for irrigation which has been shown to decrease baseflow e g bhaskar et al 2016 wen and chen 2006 however reliable records for groundwater storage are not available because they are not complete or long enough to analyze changes in water resources brutsaert 2008 large scale landscape modifications have likely affected atmospheric processes such as temperature precipitation evapotranspiration humidity and soil moisture alter et al 2018 bonan 1997 deangelis et al 2010 germer et al 2010 huntington 2006 twine et al 2004 agricultural land use can intensify the effect of climate change because it transforms the surface energy balance and influences temperature at the regional scale mueller et al 2016 for example bonan 1997 showed large differences in precipitation due to land use across the midwest and documented wetter conditions during the summer that were likely a result of increased latent heat flux where crops had replaced forest vegetation agricultural intensification has added moisture to the global atmosphere through evapotranspiration and a large percentage of the vapor actualizes directly over irrigated lands ferguson and maxwell 2011 nocco et al 2019 sacks et al 2009 these studies highlight how difficult it can be to determine the impact of climate and land use changes because human activities influence watershed characteristics and near surface climate dynamics to date there are no studies that disentangled the effects of interdependent controlling variables on baseflow previous climate and land use change research has tended to focus on streamflow ahiablame et al 2017b chien et al 2013 gupta et al 2018 juckem et al 2008 kibria et al 2016 norton et al 2019 slater and villarini 2017 however baseflow is a distinct streamflow component because it includes subsurface water from different flow paths i e deep regional groundwater storage and shallow near streamflow paths miller et al 2014 price 2011 more detailed analysis is needed to understand how climate and land use have affected this nuanced water resource previous studies that have determined the influence of forcing factors on baseflow have been limited in their scope where they have either examined baseflow on a small scale e g kibria et al 2016 mishra et al 2010 price et al 2011 or on an annual basis e g brutsaert 2008 and or their methods focused on individual drivers ayers et al 2019 for instance ayers et al 2019 reported the correlation coefficients between baseflow and different forcing factors including precipitation temperature and agricultural intensity however they did not account for the potential concurrent role of different drivers nor did they develop a statistical model to capture the influence of different drivers therefore considering the gap in our attribution of the detected changes in baseflow the crucial objective of this study is to determine the main drivers responsible for the historical changes in monthly baseflow at 458 u s geological survey usgs stream gauges in the u s midwest in term of drivers we focus on the role of climate precipitation temperature and antecedent wetness and land use land cover changes agriculture using regression models 2 materials and methods 2 1 data we selected 458 usgs stream gauges located within 12 different u s midwest states which include illinois indiana iowa kansas michigan minnesota missouri nebraska north dakota ohio south dakota and wisconsin fig 1 while the gauges themselves are located within these 12 different states their watershed boundaries extend outside of the region the stations were chosen based on long term gauging records where each record had at least 50 years of data the record length was extended as far back as 1940 in some cases because of data availability however the oldest common year among the gauges is 1966 mean daily streamflow data for these sites were downloaded from the usgs nwis website u s geological survey 2016 drainage areas of the catchments range from 19 63 km2 to 1 074 586 km2 with a median basin size of approximately 1525 km2 across all basins the range of mean annual baseflow ranges from 0 02428 to 1192 m3 s with an average of 25 51 m3 s to model historical monthly baseflow basin averaged precipitation antecedent wetness i e the previous three month s precipitation temperature and agricultural land use were used as predictors in the model formulations table 1 both monthly precipitation and monthly average temperature data were based on the parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model prism climate group daly et al 2002 these data are freely available on a 4 km grid resolution for the conterminous united states prism data extend back to 1895 and thus cover the study period 1940 2019 for every usgs gauge the monthly time series of mean monthly basin average precipitation and temperature were calculated with the basin boundaries from the usgs streamgage nhdplus version 1 stewart et al 2006 we define antecedent wetness by using the previous month s precipitation as an approximation for basin wetness because there is insufficient soil moisture data for the last 50 years defining it from precipitation observations is valuable for understanding water availability in the subsurface the sum of the previous three months was used for modeling baseflow in the midwest but we also performed sensitivity analysis to examine the role of different weighting schemes see section 3 4 to analyze land use changes we considered the effects of agricultural intensity on baseflow we used harvested acreage of corn and soybeans because they are the main crops that are grown in the study domain and have been shown to be a significant predictor in similar studies neri et al 2019 schilling 2005 schilling et al 2008 slater and villarini 2017 villarini and strong 2014 county level data are obtained from the u s department of agriculture usda s national agricultural statistics service nass quickstats database usda and nass 2020 total annual corn and soybean harvested acres were computed as a weighted average for each watershed based on the percentage of each county within an individual watershed assuming that the crops were evenly distributed throughout the county e g neri et al 2019 villarini and strong 2014 annual agricultural intensity values were used in model selection because crops are typically grown on an annual cycle similar to slater and villarini 2017 we only considered agriculture in watersheds that had at least 30 of the area covered by corn and soybeans at any given point in the historical time series this threshold limits the inclusion of agriculture as a predictor to those watersheds that experienced substantial land use change in corn and soybeans over the study record and excludes those that would have a false signal i e watersheds that change from 0 005 to 0 1 few observations were missing from each dataset so when missing data were present in the record in either baseflow precipitation temperature or antecedent wetness the data for that year were excluded from the analysis 2 2 baseflow separation many different analytical methods have been developed to separate baseflow from streamflow arnold and allen 1999 eckhardt 2008 lyne and hollick 1979 nathan and mcmahon 1990 sloto and crouse 1996 in this study we used a hydrograph separation method the one parameter digital filter technique that was first proposed by lyne and hollick 1979 the recursive digital filter used for baseflow separation is mathematically expressed as arnold and allen 1999 lyne and hollick 1979 nathan and mcmahon 1990 1 q t α q t 1 1 α 2 q t q t 1 where q t is the filtered direct runoff at the t time step q t 1 is the filtered direct runoff at the t 1 time step α is the recession constant q t is the total streamflow at the t time step and q t 1 is the streamflow at the t 1 time step the recession constant α is the parameter that describes the rate at which streamflow decreases following a rainfall event we used α 0 925 in our study because it has been shown to be an accurate value for watersheds in the u s midwest and studies have reported consistent results arnold and allen 1999 nathan and mcmahon 1990 in addition this method provides a quick and easy way to obtain a time series of baseflow which would otherwise be difficult to obtain for the 458 stream gauges analyzed in this study other methods would require more information about the bedrock and stream type which is not realistic across a large region such as the midwest i e the eckhardt method eckhardt 2005 figure s1 shows an example usgs station 05440000 of the streamflow hydrograph with the baseflow time series separated out all baseflow separation calculations were performed in r using the ecohydrology package fuka et al 2018 2 3 statistical modeling to describe variability in baseflow we fit statistical models using precipitation x p antecedent wetness x m temperature x t and agricultural intensity x a as covariates our statistical modeling builds on the methodology described in villarini and strong 2014 we selected the gamma distribution for modeling monthly baseflow because it has worked well for modeling streamflow and low flows across the study area slater and villarini 2017 villarini and strong 2014 the gamma distribution has two parameters which include the location μ and scale σ and they depend linearly on the predictors via a logarithmic link function the variability of the μ parameter over time was described by one of 16 possible regression models that relate baseflow to the four covariates in our model four regression models are shown in table 1 as examples for the most common model formulations on the other hand the σ parameter was held constant similar to previous studies slater and villarini 2017 villarini and strong 2014 we modeled baseflow based on the parameterization in the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 the monthly models are probabilistic and provide a probability distribution for every year model selection is based on the bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 which balances statistical fit with model parsimony it utilizes a larger penalty function than other criteria such as the akaike information criterion akaike 1978 and it generally suggests a model with fewer parameters at each of the 458 sites and for every month the best fit gamlss model one out of 16 potential models was chosen in terms of the predictors and their functional relation to the parameters of the probability distribution we ran model selection only on those months that contributed greater than 5 of total annual baseflow we also performed leave one out cross validation where for each year and month we removed the observation and predicted it using the remainder of the observations in the record this process was repeated for every year until we obtained a complete time series the cross validation results were compared with the observed data using pearson s correlation coefficient r 2 4 trend analysis the mann kendall mk nonparametric trend test kendall 1948 mann 1945 was used to determine the presence of temporal trends in monthly baseflow it is a rank based statistical method that determines monotonic patterns in the central part of the distribution trend detection was run over the 1966 2018 record period because it is the common year for all stream gauges considered in this study the mk statistic z has the same interpretation as other trend analysis statistics where a positive negative value indicates an increase decrease over time to offset the potential impact of autocorrelation on the trend results a variation of the mk test i e prewhitening based on the approach described by yue et al 2002 was used and the results are reported here in this study we set the significance level to 5 we use this metric to assess how successful our models are at reproducing the observed trends in monthly baseflow 3 results and discussion 3 1 statistical model fits for each month s best fit model the correlation coefficient was used as an assessment of the degree that the model simulations matched the observed baseflow records fig 2 we also performed leave one out cross validation to evaluate the robustness of our model s predictive ability overall the correlation coefficients were high with a mean r 0 70 and median r 0 73 for all months this indicates the good prediction skills of these statistical models goodness of fit varies based on regional differences in climatic differences antecedent conditions and the presence of agricultural land use the model fit distributions are best fit during the summer months where average r values are 0 69 0 72 and 0 71 in may june and july respectively we are still able to capture baseflow during periods of little to no precipitation which suggests that antecedent conditions play a large role in baseflow discharge correlation coefficients have an average value of 0 71 0 68 and 0 59 during december january and february respectively models performed the worst in april mean r 0 57 and while it is comparatively low it still indicates good correlation these results show how monthly baseflow follows large scale weather patterns in the study region andresen et al 2012 villarini 2016 models exhibit the poorest skill in the western part of the domain nebraska kansas south dakota north dakota and northern minnesota where there is a difference in climate compared with the rest of the midwest and hydrologic response occurs later in the year because of snowmelt and rain on frozen ground in the spring neri et al 2019 villarini 2016 lower correlation is observed in kansas and nebraska which is a region where groundwater pumping is prevalent a lowered water table from groundwater abstraction can alter lateral flow and decrease discharge from groundwater systems condon and maxwell 2019 while groundwater pumping for agricultural purposes may be correlated with one another previous studies have shown that while pumping alone has caused decreases in streamflow irrigation for agriculture may cancel out decreases on an annual basis brutsaert 2008 wang and cai 2010 although we were not able to examine the relationship between baseflow and groundwater pumping in this study it may be of interest for future research to further examine how well our models perform leave one out cross validation was conducted for the best fitting model at every site and month the correlation coefficients for cross validation were high mean r 0 62 median r 0 66 which supports previous findings that our models exhibit good skills these results highlight the potential applicability of these models for monthly baseflow forecasting neri et al 2019 slater and villarini 2018 3 2 forcing factors the uniqueness of our statistical modeling framework is that it selects the best set of covariates to describe the response variable baseflow fig 3 shows which drivers were chosen in the model formulations table 1 at every streamflow gauge and for selected months supplemental material s2 s5 show the results for all months while fig 3 shows one month for each season i e march june september and december for simplicity we found that precipitation was a major driver across the region 79 of the best fitting models include it in the model formulation as expected increasing baseflow is positively related to precipitation because it is the major source of recharge to groundwater systems memon 1995 from april to july precipitation is chosen more often than other months of the year between 77 and 93 during the spring the u s midwest often receives large amounts of rainfall which are often associated with extratropical storms and atmospheric rivers nayak and villarini 2017 villarini 2016 model selection for precipitation is different in the east compared to the northwest region the precipitation baseflow relationship is detected more often in the east during the winter there are differences in weather patterns which have a strong control over water resources it is wetter and warmer in the central and eastern midwest than the west and these patterns can be observed in the variability of the relationship between baseflow and precipitation precipitation is selected as a driver during the winter months mostly in the east missouri illinois indiana and ohio it is considered a major driver given that precipitation inputs determine water availability for soil moisture conditions which is relevant to baseflow these results support the notion that increasing regional precipitation is the dominant driver of positive streamflow trends across the area frans et al 2013 hodgkins et al 2007 slater and villarini 2016 tomer and schilling 2009 antecedent wetness was the most important driver in the u s midwest because it was selected most often i e 93 of the best fitting models included x m as a significant predictor similar to precipitation a positive relationship between the two variables indicates that more moisture in the soil from the previous three months precipitation will lead to an increase in baseflow response the model that was selected most often for all sites and months was the model that only considered antecedent wetness x m and precipitation x p in its model formulation about 41 of sites table 1 it is well established that basin wetness plays a major role in controlling the flow distribution and it is especially important for low flows berghuijs et al 2016 slater and villarini 2017 although baseflow is directly related to groundwater storage in a catchment it also changes in response to precipitation events brutsaert 2008 the ability of our models to capture baseflow during periods of little to no rainfall from september february is largely dependent upon soil moisture in the winter wetter antecedent conditions paired with lower evapotranspiration rates could contribute to increased groundwater recharge and groundwater contribution to streamflow bosch et al 2016 the inclusion of temperature as a predictor in the model produced a better fit for certain subregions and specific months about 21 of all the best fit models for every site and month identify temperature as a significant predictor these results show how monthly baseflow follows a strong seasonal pattern of winter precipitation and spring snowmelt in colder months january march there is a notable positive relationship between baseflow and temperature as temperature warms in the spring the relationship between temperature and baseflow flips from positive to negative the negative relationship is first observed in march in the south and east nebraska missouri indiana and ohio where temperatures get higher earlier in the year watersheds in higher latitudes hold snow for a longer time because temperatures are colder and larger flows are not observed until later in the season when snow melts and the ground thaws byun et al 2019 this phenomenon is observed with baseflow response in the northwest continuing later into the spring the negative relationship gradually moves north iowa minnesota the dakotas and from april to may most sites identify temperature as a significant negative predictor the inverse relationship between temperature and baseflow is expected because warmer temperatures increase evaporation and thus reduce soil moisture temperature changes in the u s have trended towards warming over the past century trends in seasonality have been documented where a greater proportion of the regional warming has occurred in the winter and spring andresen et al 2012 kibria et al 2016 zhang et al 2000 which have caused higher flows to occur in the winter and spring there is also evidence that mean summer temperatures have decreased in sections of the u s midwest andresen et al 2012 mueller et al 2016 which could explain the inverse relationship between temperature and baseflow from april to july because increasing trends in baseflow have been documented throughout the region during these months ayers et al 2019 in addition cooling in the u s midwest is often associated with agricultural intensity and evapotranspiration which could magnify this effect pan et al 2004 zhang et al 2000 the influence of agricultural land use on baseflow is prominent in the cornbelt region of the study area corn and soybean harvested acres are selected more often in the growing season in watersheds with more 30 of agricultural land cover where x a was included as a potential predictor beginning in march and continuing into the summer is when models selected agriculture most often i e 24 in march 34 in may 41 in june and 34 in july for these months the cornbelt region is clearly highlighted in an arc from eastern north dakota and into iowa illinois indiana and western ohio most sites show a positive relationship between annual harvested acres and monthly baseflow these results indicated that increases in agricultural land use have increased baseflow for watersheds with greater than 30 agricultural land use while we can identify that agricultural intensity has influenced baseflow in the u s midwest we can only speculate about the specific mechanisms that are related to baseflow for example schilling and libra 2003 theorized that land use conservation practices such as terraces conservation tillage and contour cropping have contributed to increasing baseflow by slowing runoff and increasing infiltration in sloping agricultural fields no tillage practices can prevent early season soil evaporation and conserve water in the soil gallaher 1977 on the other hand tile drainage is one of the major changes in agricultural landscapes and it has significantly altered the hydrologic regime across the region both tile drainage density and incision depth affect baseflow where increasing density and depth can increase tile contribution to baseflow schilling et al 2012 2019 to understand the exact mechanisms of agricultural land practices and their influence on baseflow we would need a different modeling framework than what is considered in this study 3 3 monthly trend detection to validate our model predictions trend analysis was conducted on the monthly baseflow record from 1966 to 2019 we compared the trend results from the observed baseflow record to the results from the median value of the fitted gamma distribution fig 4 illustrates the spatial variability of the prewhitened mann kendall observed and predicted using the 50th percentile of the fitted gamma distribution time series fig 4 shows a side by side comparison using only four months but the analysis was conducted for every month the observed trends were described in detail in ayers et al 2019 and the goal here is not to analyze these trends rather we want to evaluate if our models can recreate the observed trends in monthly baseflow in terms of the drivers we have identified overall the model predictions are good at reproducing monthly trends in baseflow from may to august the two results agree the most when increasing trends are detected more often on the other hand the differences in trend analyses are the largest in both the southwest kansas nebraska and southern missouri and in the great lakes region northern wisconsin and michigan interestingly these are both areas where decreases in baseflow have been identified in the baseflow record the areas in kansas and nebraska are where groundwater abstraction has led to declining water tables brikowski 2008 sophocleous 2005 wen and chen 2006 in the great lakes region decreases in precipitation have been documented which may result in decreases in baseflow mallakpour and villarini 2015 norton et al 2019 to evaluate the model results further we compared the mk tau values between the observed and leave one out cross validation trend results fig 5 illustrates the how well the values match via the one to one line where each point is color coordinated by the correlation coefficient between the two baseflow time series for all months most values are clustered around the one to one line indicating good model fit with little to no bias the correlation coefficients of the leave one out cross validation have high r values mean r 0 62 median r 0 66 values that deviate from the one to one line for mk tau are generally those that have lower correlation coefficients as expected 3 4 sensitivity analysis of antecedent wetness we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine which definition of antecedent conditions was most relevant to baseflow the sum of the previous three months precipitation described above was compared with different ways of weighing them including 0 90 and 0 70 given to the previous month 0 10 and 0 20 given to the second month and 0 and 0 10 given to the third month respectively supplemental materials s6 and s7 as an example for june antecedent wetness was defined as 90 of may s precipitation 10 of april s precipitation and no consideration for march to determine which metric was most suitable we ran our gamlss model for each definition and compared the results the sensitivity analysis showed that the sum of the previous three months was the best metric for modeling baseflow in the u s midwest we concluded that the sum of the previous three month s precipitation captures subsurface water availability better than the different weighted values analyzed here 4 conclusions and future directions our study described a method for evaluating the drivers of monthly baseflow in the u s midwest we focused on 458 long term usgs stream gauges and developed statistical models that describe the interannual variability in monthly baseflow with different combinations of predictors precipitation antecedent wetness temperature and agriculture we used leave one out cross validation and the mann kendall trend test to verify our results the outcomes of this study can be summarized as follows 1 despite the simplicity of these statistical models they are able to capture well the monthly variations in baseflow throughout the u s midwest mean r 0 70 however there were differences in model fits across the region and for different months generally the models fit better during warm months may july and in the central and eastern part of the u s midwest the robustness of these results was also supported by the leave one out cross validation mean r 0 62 2 most models included both precipitation and antecedent wetness and the model formulation that was selected most often included only these two predictors 41 of the best fit models for all months antecedent wetness was the most important predictor 92 included x m followed by precipitation which was selected 79 of the time 3 temperature was not a strong predictor 21 but its inclusion from march to may produced a better fit in some areas like in the west and northwest in the spring it is evident that temperature likely through the effect of snowmelt significantly influences monthly baseflow 4 agriculture was selected as a relevant predictor most often during the growing season from march to july there was a positive relationship between agriculture and baseflow in the cornbelt region which indicates that corn and soybean production promote baseflow discharge to streams 5 to further evaluate the performance of the modeling framework we used the model formulations to identify monthly trends in baseflow we compared the prewhitened mk trend analysis results from the observed monthly baseflow record to the median of the fitted distribution we found the same trends for most stations within the u s midwest however our models were unable to capture the decreasing trends in kansas nebraska southern missouri and in northern wisconsin and michigan which is likely due to the role of other drivers not included as predictors e g groundwater withdrawal 6 overall these results paint a different picture due to the role of agriculture compared with similar studies that focused on flooding and the frequency of flood events e g neri et al 2019 slater and villarini 2017 in which agriculture was not selected as an important predictor it appears that agricultural intensity plays a more dominant role at the lower end of the discharge spectrum building on this study there are a number of future research directions that this work could be taken for instance it could be of interest to evaluate the influence of specific mechanisms behind land use or climate change e g tile drainage conservation practices evapotranspiration or groundwater pumping assess the interaction between baseflow drivers e g land use on soil moisture conditions examine future changes in baseflow based on projections of predictors and quantify the relationship between baseflow and indicators of water quality although future research is needed to determine the influence of forcing factors in other regions of the world our work provides a clear framework to understand and describe baseflow in the context of climate and land use change ultimately these models show the potential

5025,baseflow or the groundwater component of streamflow is an important source of water for several applications from increasing demands on freshwater resources to ecosystem health despite its relevance our understanding of the processes driving baseflow and its interannual variability is limited in this study we focus on 458 u s geological survey streamflow gauges that have at least 50 years of daily data we use a statistical modeling framework to select a set of predictors that represent the role of climate i e precipitation temperature and antecedent wetness and land use harvested acres of corn and soybeans the models are able to describe well the variability in monthly baseflow across the region with an average correlation coefficient between the observational records and the median of the fitted distribution of 0 70 among all months our results indicate that precipitation and antecedent wetness are the strongest predictors where the latter was selected the most often temperature is an important predictor during the spring when snow related processes are the most relevant agriculture was frequently selected in the cornbelt region during the growing season from march to july the results of this study can inform future watershed management that sustains low flows and improves water quality 1 introduction baseflow is the portion of streamflow discharged from groundwater or other delayed sources it is an important water resource because it sustains streamflow between precipitation events or periods of drought and it has potential consequences for water quality kang et al 2008 schilling and lutz 2004 schilling and zhang 2004 although we have progressed significantly in our understanding of the changes in streamflow we still do not fully understand what factors influence baseflow baseflow varies regionally and spatially because it is affected by differences in climate topography surface water groundwater and human activities price 2011 santhi et al 2008 watershed characteristics such as geology and topography that promote infiltration and recharge have been shown to be important for sustaining baseflow price et al 2011 zimmer and gannon 2018 on the other hand climate factors e g precipitation and temperature influence baseflow through water availability evapotranspiration rates and the timing of snowmelt runoff ahiablame et al 2017a cadol et al 2012 gupta et al 2018 mishra et al 2010 slater and villarini 2017 although climate controls the availability and timing of discharge previous research has shown that climate alone cannot explain observed changes in baseflow raymond et al 2008 schilling and libra 2003 tomer and schilling 2009 often land use and land cover influence soil and topographic characteristics that dictate whether precipitation is distributed as either runoff or recharge while previous studies identified changes in baseflow across large areas of the midwest ahiablame et al 2017a ayers et al 2019 ficklin et al 2016 zhang and schilling 2006 it is still unclear what factors are driving these changes in the midwest natural vegetation of grasslands wetlands and prairies have been converted to maize and soybean row crops e g frans et al 2013 this area also known as the cornbelt region is one of the highest yielding global agricultural areas for corn nikiel and eltahir 2019 studies have identified agricultural land use as an important driver for increases in baseflow across the region ahiablame et al 2017a ayers et al 2019 schilling 2005 schilling and libra 2003 for a watershed in iowa schilling and libra 2003 argued that improved agricultural management practices in the second half of the 20th century contributed to increasing baseflow in addition tile drainage has been a crucial part of agricultural systems tiles remove excess water from traditional wetlands which provides a nutrient rich environment for corn and soybean production e g kelly et al 2016 while artificial drainage has changed the hydrologic regime across agricultural landscapes and contributes to baseflow arenas amado et al 2017 basu et al 2012 blann et al 2009 schilling et al 2019 the extent of its control remains unknown another component of land use change has been groundwater pumping for irrigation which has been shown to decrease baseflow e g bhaskar et al 2016 wen and chen 2006 however reliable records for groundwater storage are not available because they are not complete or long enough to analyze changes in water resources brutsaert 2008 large scale landscape modifications have likely affected atmospheric processes such as temperature precipitation evapotranspiration humidity and soil moisture alter et al 2018 bonan 1997 deangelis et al 2010 germer et al 2010 huntington 2006 twine et al 2004 agricultural land use can intensify the effect of climate change because it transforms the surface energy balance and influences temperature at the regional scale mueller et al 2016 for example bonan 1997 showed large differences in precipitation due to land use across the midwest and documented wetter conditions during the summer that were likely a result of increased latent heat flux where crops had replaced forest vegetation agricultural intensification has added moisture to the global atmosphere through evapotranspiration and a large percentage of the vapor actualizes directly over irrigated lands ferguson and maxwell 2011 nocco et al 2019 sacks et al 2009 these studies highlight how difficult it can be to determine the impact of climate and land use changes because human activities influence watershed characteristics and near surface climate dynamics to date there are no studies that disentangled the effects of interdependent controlling variables on baseflow previous climate and land use change research has tended to focus on streamflow ahiablame et al 2017b chien et al 2013 gupta et al 2018 juckem et al 2008 kibria et al 2016 norton et al 2019 slater and villarini 2017 however baseflow is a distinct streamflow component because it includes subsurface water from different flow paths i e deep regional groundwater storage and shallow near streamflow paths miller et al 2014 price 2011 more detailed analysis is needed to understand how climate and land use have affected this nuanced water resource previous studies that have determined the influence of forcing factors on baseflow have been limited in their scope where they have either examined baseflow on a small scale e g kibria et al 2016 mishra et al 2010 price et al 2011 or on an annual basis e g brutsaert 2008 and or their methods focused on individual drivers ayers et al 2019 for instance ayers et al 2019 reported the correlation coefficients between baseflow and different forcing factors including precipitation temperature and agricultural intensity however they did not account for the potential concurrent role of different drivers nor did they develop a statistical model to capture the influence of different drivers therefore considering the gap in our attribution of the detected changes in baseflow the crucial objective of this study is to determine the main drivers responsible for the historical changes in monthly baseflow at 458 u s geological survey usgs stream gauges in the u s midwest in term of drivers we focus on the role of climate precipitation temperature and antecedent wetness and land use land cover changes agriculture using regression models 2 materials and methods 2 1 data we selected 458 usgs stream gauges located within 12 different u s midwest states which include illinois indiana iowa kansas michigan minnesota missouri nebraska north dakota ohio south dakota and wisconsin fig 1 while the gauges themselves are located within these 12 different states their watershed boundaries extend outside of the region the stations were chosen based on long term gauging records where each record had at least 50 years of data the record length was extended as far back as 1940 in some cases because of data availability however the oldest common year among the gauges is 1966 mean daily streamflow data for these sites were downloaded from the usgs nwis website u s geological survey 2016 drainage areas of the catchments range from 19 63 km2 to 1 074 586 km2 with a median basin size of approximately 1525 km2 across all basins the range of mean annual baseflow ranges from 0 02428 to 1192 m3 s with an average of 25 51 m3 s to model historical monthly baseflow basin averaged precipitation antecedent wetness i e the previous three month s precipitation temperature and agricultural land use were used as predictors in the model formulations table 1 both monthly precipitation and monthly average temperature data were based on the parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model prism climate group daly et al 2002 these data are freely available on a 4 km grid resolution for the conterminous united states prism data extend back to 1895 and thus cover the study period 1940 2019 for every usgs gauge the monthly time series of mean monthly basin average precipitation and temperature were calculated with the basin boundaries from the usgs streamgage nhdplus version 1 stewart et al 2006 we define antecedent wetness by using the previous month s precipitation as an approximation for basin wetness because there is insufficient soil moisture data for the last 50 years defining it from precipitation observations is valuable for understanding water availability in the subsurface the sum of the previous three months was used for modeling baseflow in the midwest but we also performed sensitivity analysis to examine the role of different weighting schemes see section 3 4 to analyze land use changes we considered the effects of agricultural intensity on baseflow we used harvested acreage of corn and soybeans because they are the main crops that are grown in the study domain and have been shown to be a significant predictor in similar studies neri et al 2019 schilling 2005 schilling et al 2008 slater and villarini 2017 villarini and strong 2014 county level data are obtained from the u s department of agriculture usda s national agricultural statistics service nass quickstats database usda and nass 2020 total annual corn and soybean harvested acres were computed as a weighted average for each watershed based on the percentage of each county within an individual watershed assuming that the crops were evenly distributed throughout the county e g neri et al 2019 villarini and strong 2014 annual agricultural intensity values were used in model selection because crops are typically grown on an annual cycle similar to slater and villarini 2017 we only considered agriculture in watersheds that had at least 30 of the area covered by corn and soybeans at any given point in the historical time series this threshold limits the inclusion of agriculture as a predictor to those watersheds that experienced substantial land use change in corn and soybeans over the study record and excludes those that would have a false signal i e watersheds that change from 0 005 to 0 1 few observations were missing from each dataset so when missing data were present in the record in either baseflow precipitation temperature or antecedent wetness the data for that year were excluded from the analysis 2 2 baseflow separation many different analytical methods have been developed to separate baseflow from streamflow arnold and allen 1999 eckhardt 2008 lyne and hollick 1979 nathan and mcmahon 1990 sloto and crouse 1996 in this study we used a hydrograph separation method the one parameter digital filter technique that was first proposed by lyne and hollick 1979 the recursive digital filter used for baseflow separation is mathematically expressed as arnold and allen 1999 lyne and hollick 1979 nathan and mcmahon 1990 1 q t α q t 1 1 α 2 q t q t 1 where q t is the filtered direct runoff at the t time step q t 1 is the filtered direct runoff at the t 1 time step α is the recession constant q t is the total streamflow at the t time step and q t 1 is the streamflow at the t 1 time step the recession constant α is the parameter that describes the rate at which streamflow decreases following a rainfall event we used α 0 925 in our study because it has been shown to be an accurate value for watersheds in the u s midwest and studies have reported consistent results arnold and allen 1999 nathan and mcmahon 1990 in addition this method provides a quick and easy way to obtain a time series of baseflow which would otherwise be difficult to obtain for the 458 stream gauges analyzed in this study other methods would require more information about the bedrock and stream type which is not realistic across a large region such as the midwest i e the eckhardt method eckhardt 2005 figure s1 shows an example usgs station 05440000 of the streamflow hydrograph with the baseflow time series separated out all baseflow separation calculations were performed in r using the ecohydrology package fuka et al 2018 2 3 statistical modeling to describe variability in baseflow we fit statistical models using precipitation x p antecedent wetness x m temperature x t and agricultural intensity x a as covariates our statistical modeling builds on the methodology described in villarini and strong 2014 we selected the gamma distribution for modeling monthly baseflow because it has worked well for modeling streamflow and low flows across the study area slater and villarini 2017 villarini and strong 2014 the gamma distribution has two parameters which include the location μ and scale σ and they depend linearly on the predictors via a logarithmic link function the variability of the μ parameter over time was described by one of 16 possible regression models that relate baseflow to the four covariates in our model four regression models are shown in table 1 as examples for the most common model formulations on the other hand the σ parameter was held constant similar to previous studies slater and villarini 2017 villarini and strong 2014 we modeled baseflow based on the parameterization in the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 the monthly models are probabilistic and provide a probability distribution for every year model selection is based on the bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 which balances statistical fit with model parsimony it utilizes a larger penalty function than other criteria such as the akaike information criterion akaike 1978 and it generally suggests a model with fewer parameters at each of the 458 sites and for every month the best fit gamlss model one out of 16 potential models was chosen in terms of the predictors and their functional relation to the parameters of the probability distribution we ran model selection only on those months that contributed greater than 5 of total annual baseflow we also performed leave one out cross validation where for each year and month we removed the observation and predicted it using the remainder of the observations in the record this process was repeated for every year until we obtained a complete time series the cross validation results were compared with the observed data using pearson s correlation coefficient r 2 4 trend analysis the mann kendall mk nonparametric trend test kendall 1948 mann 1945 was used to determine the presence of temporal trends in monthly baseflow it is a rank based statistical method that determines monotonic patterns in the central part of the distribution trend detection was run over the 1966 2018 record period because it is the common year for all stream gauges considered in this study the mk statistic z has the same interpretation as other trend analysis statistics where a positive negative value indicates an increase decrease over time to offset the potential impact of autocorrelation on the trend results a variation of the mk test i e prewhitening based on the approach described by yue et al 2002 was used and the results are reported here in this study we set the significance level to 5 we use this metric to assess how successful our models are at reproducing the observed trends in monthly baseflow 3 results and discussion 3 1 statistical model fits for each month s best fit model the correlation coefficient was used as an assessment of the degree that the model simulations matched the observed baseflow records fig 2 we also performed leave one out cross validation to evaluate the robustness of our model s predictive ability overall the correlation coefficients were high with a mean r 0 70 and median r 0 73 for all months this indicates the good prediction skills of these statistical models goodness of fit varies based on regional differences in climatic differences antecedent conditions and the presence of agricultural land use the model fit distributions are best fit during the summer months where average r values are 0 69 0 72 and 0 71 in may june and july respectively we are still able to capture baseflow during periods of little to no precipitation which suggests that antecedent conditions play a large role in baseflow discharge correlation coefficients have an average value of 0 71 0 68 and 0 59 during december january and february respectively models performed the worst in april mean r 0 57 and while it is comparatively low it still indicates good correlation these results show how monthly baseflow follows large scale weather patterns in the study region andresen et al 2012 villarini 2016 models exhibit the poorest skill in the western part of the domain nebraska kansas south dakota north dakota and northern minnesota where there is a difference in climate compared with the rest of the midwest and hydrologic response occurs later in the year because of snowmelt and rain on frozen ground in the spring neri et al 2019 villarini 2016 lower correlation is observed in kansas and nebraska which is a region where groundwater pumping is prevalent a lowered water table from groundwater abstraction can alter lateral flow and decrease discharge from groundwater systems condon and maxwell 2019 while groundwater pumping for agricultural purposes may be correlated with one another previous studies have shown that while pumping alone has caused decreases in streamflow irrigation for agriculture may cancel out decreases on an annual basis brutsaert 2008 wang and cai 2010 although we were not able to examine the relationship between baseflow and groundwater pumping in this study it may be of interest for future research to further examine how well our models perform leave one out cross validation was conducted for the best fitting model at every site and month the correlation coefficients for cross validation were high mean r 0 62 median r 0 66 which supports previous findings that our models exhibit good skills these results highlight the potential applicability of these models for monthly baseflow forecasting neri et al 2019 slater and villarini 2018 3 2 forcing factors the uniqueness of our statistical modeling framework is that it selects the best set of covariates to describe the response variable baseflow fig 3 shows which drivers were chosen in the model formulations table 1 at every streamflow gauge and for selected months supplemental material s2 s5 show the results for all months while fig 3 shows one month for each season i e march june september and december for simplicity we found that precipitation was a major driver across the region 79 of the best fitting models include it in the model formulation as expected increasing baseflow is positively related to precipitation because it is the major source of recharge to groundwater systems memon 1995 from april to july precipitation is chosen more often than other months of the year between 77 and 93 during the spring the u s midwest often receives large amounts of rainfall which are often associated with extratropical storms and atmospheric rivers nayak and villarini 2017 villarini 2016 model selection for precipitation is different in the east compared to the northwest region the precipitation baseflow relationship is detected more often in the east during the winter there are differences in weather patterns which have a strong control over water resources it is wetter and warmer in the central and eastern midwest than the west and these patterns can be observed in the variability of the relationship between baseflow and precipitation precipitation is selected as a driver during the winter months mostly in the east missouri illinois indiana and ohio it is considered a major driver given that precipitation inputs determine water availability for soil moisture conditions which is relevant to baseflow these results support the notion that increasing regional precipitation is the dominant driver of positive streamflow trends across the area frans et al 2013 hodgkins et al 2007 slater and villarini 2016 tomer and schilling 2009 antecedent wetness was the most important driver in the u s midwest because it was selected most often i e 93 of the best fitting models included x m as a significant predictor similar to precipitation a positive relationship between the two variables indicates that more moisture in the soil from the previous three months precipitation will lead to an increase in baseflow response the model that was selected most often for all sites and months was the model that only considered antecedent wetness x m and precipitation x p in its model formulation about 41 of sites table 1 it is well established that basin wetness plays a major role in controlling the flow distribution and it is especially important for low flows berghuijs et al 2016 slater and villarini 2017 although baseflow is directly related to groundwater storage in a catchment it also changes in response to precipitation events brutsaert 2008 the ability of our models to capture baseflow during periods of little to no rainfall from september february is largely dependent upon soil moisture in the winter wetter antecedent conditions paired with lower evapotranspiration rates could contribute to increased groundwater recharge and groundwater contribution to streamflow bosch et al 2016 the inclusion of temperature as a predictor in the model produced a better fit for certain subregions and specific months about 21 of all the best fit models for every site and month identify temperature as a significant predictor these results show how monthly baseflow follows a strong seasonal pattern of winter precipitation and spring snowmelt in colder months january march there is a notable positive relationship between baseflow and temperature as temperature warms in the spring the relationship between temperature and baseflow flips from positive to negative the negative relationship is first observed in march in the south and east nebraska missouri indiana and ohio where temperatures get higher earlier in the year watersheds in higher latitudes hold snow for a longer time because temperatures are colder and larger flows are not observed until later in the season when snow melts and the ground thaws byun et al 2019 this phenomenon is observed with baseflow response in the northwest continuing later into the spring the negative relationship gradually moves north iowa minnesota the dakotas and from april to may most sites identify temperature as a significant negative predictor the inverse relationship between temperature and baseflow is expected because warmer temperatures increase evaporation and thus reduce soil moisture temperature changes in the u s have trended towards warming over the past century trends in seasonality have been documented where a greater proportion of the regional warming has occurred in the winter and spring andresen et al 2012 kibria et al 2016 zhang et al 2000 which have caused higher flows to occur in the winter and spring there is also evidence that mean summer temperatures have decreased in sections of the u s midwest andresen et al 2012 mueller et al 2016 which could explain the inverse relationship between temperature and baseflow from april to july because increasing trends in baseflow have been documented throughout the region during these months ayers et al 2019 in addition cooling in the u s midwest is often associated with agricultural intensity and evapotranspiration which could magnify this effect pan et al 2004 zhang et al 2000 the influence of agricultural land use on baseflow is prominent in the cornbelt region of the study area corn and soybean harvested acres are selected more often in the growing season in watersheds with more 30 of agricultural land cover where x a was included as a potential predictor beginning in march and continuing into the summer is when models selected agriculture most often i e 24 in march 34 in may 41 in june and 34 in july for these months the cornbelt region is clearly highlighted in an arc from eastern north dakota and into iowa illinois indiana and western ohio most sites show a positive relationship between annual harvested acres and monthly baseflow these results indicated that increases in agricultural land use have increased baseflow for watersheds with greater than 30 agricultural land use while we can identify that agricultural intensity has influenced baseflow in the u s midwest we can only speculate about the specific mechanisms that are related to baseflow for example schilling and libra 2003 theorized that land use conservation practices such as terraces conservation tillage and contour cropping have contributed to increasing baseflow by slowing runoff and increasing infiltration in sloping agricultural fields no tillage practices can prevent early season soil evaporation and conserve water in the soil gallaher 1977 on the other hand tile drainage is one of the major changes in agricultural landscapes and it has significantly altered the hydrologic regime across the region both tile drainage density and incision depth affect baseflow where increasing density and depth can increase tile contribution to baseflow schilling et al 2012 2019 to understand the exact mechanisms of agricultural land practices and their influence on baseflow we would need a different modeling framework than what is considered in this study 3 3 monthly trend detection to validate our model predictions trend analysis was conducted on the monthly baseflow record from 1966 to 2019 we compared the trend results from the observed baseflow record to the results from the median value of the fitted gamma distribution fig 4 illustrates the spatial variability of the prewhitened mann kendall observed and predicted using the 50th percentile of the fitted gamma distribution time series fig 4 shows a side by side comparison using only four months but the analysis was conducted for every month the observed trends were described in detail in ayers et al 2019 and the goal here is not to analyze these trends rather we want to evaluate if our models can recreate the observed trends in monthly baseflow in terms of the drivers we have identified overall the model predictions are good at reproducing monthly trends in baseflow from may to august the two results agree the most when increasing trends are detected more often on the other hand the differences in trend analyses are the largest in both the southwest kansas nebraska and southern missouri and in the great lakes region northern wisconsin and michigan interestingly these are both areas where decreases in baseflow have been identified in the baseflow record the areas in kansas and nebraska are where groundwater abstraction has led to declining water tables brikowski 2008 sophocleous 2005 wen and chen 2006 in the great lakes region decreases in precipitation have been documented which may result in decreases in baseflow mallakpour and villarini 2015 norton et al 2019 to evaluate the model results further we compared the mk tau values between the observed and leave one out cross validation trend results fig 5 illustrates the how well the values match via the one to one line where each point is color coordinated by the correlation coefficient between the two baseflow time series for all months most values are clustered around the one to one line indicating good model fit with little to no bias the correlation coefficients of the leave one out cross validation have high r values mean r 0 62 median r 0 66 values that deviate from the one to one line for mk tau are generally those that have lower correlation coefficients as expected 3 4 sensitivity analysis of antecedent wetness we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine which definition of antecedent conditions was most relevant to baseflow the sum of the previous three months precipitation described above was compared with different ways of weighing them including 0 90 and 0 70 given to the previous month 0 10 and 0 20 given to the second month and 0 and 0 10 given to the third month respectively supplemental materials s6 and s7 as an example for june antecedent wetness was defined as 90 of may s precipitation 10 of april s precipitation and no consideration for march to determine which metric was most suitable we ran our gamlss model for each definition and compared the results the sensitivity analysis showed that the sum of the previous three months was the best metric for modeling baseflow in the u s midwest we concluded that the sum of the previous three month s precipitation captures subsurface water availability better than the different weighted values analyzed here 4 conclusions and future directions our study described a method for evaluating the drivers of monthly baseflow in the u s midwest we focused on 458 long term usgs stream gauges and developed statistical models that describe the interannual variability in monthly baseflow with different combinations of predictors precipitation antecedent wetness temperature and agriculture we used leave one out cross validation and the mann kendall trend test to verify our results the outcomes of this study can be summarized as follows 1 despite the simplicity of these statistical models they are able to capture well the monthly variations in baseflow throughout the u s midwest mean r 0 70 however there were differences in model fits across the region and for different months generally the models fit better during warm months may july and in the central and eastern part of the u s midwest the robustness of these results was also supported by the leave one out cross validation mean r 0 62 2 most models included both precipitation and antecedent wetness and the model formulation that was selected most often included only these two predictors 41 of the best fit models for all months antecedent wetness was the most important predictor 92 included x m followed by precipitation which was selected 79 of the time 3 temperature was not a strong predictor 21 but its inclusion from march to may produced a better fit in some areas like in the west and northwest in the spring it is evident that temperature likely through the effect of snowmelt significantly influences monthly baseflow 4 agriculture was selected as a relevant predictor most often during the growing season from march to july there was a positive relationship between agriculture and baseflow in the cornbelt region which indicates that corn and soybean production promote baseflow discharge to streams 5 to further evaluate the performance of the modeling framework we used the model formulations to identify monthly trends in baseflow we compared the prewhitened mk trend analysis results from the observed monthly baseflow record to the median of the fitted distribution we found the same trends for most stations within the u s midwest however our models were unable to capture the decreasing trends in kansas nebraska southern missouri and in northern wisconsin and michigan which is likely due to the role of other drivers not included as predictors e g groundwater withdrawal 6 overall these results paint a different picture due to the role of agriculture compared with similar studies that focused on flooding and the frequency of flood events e g neri et al 2019 slater and villarini 2017 in which agriculture was not selected as an important predictor it appears that agricultural intensity plays a more dominant role at the lower end of the discharge spectrum building on this study there are a number of future research directions that this work could be taken for instance it could be of interest to evaluate the influence of specific mechanisms behind land use or climate change e g tile drainage conservation practices evapotranspiration or groundwater pumping assess the interaction between baseflow drivers e g land use on soil moisture conditions examine future changes in baseflow based on projections of predictors and quantify the relationship between baseflow and indicators of water quality although future research is needed to determine the influence of forcing factors in other regions of the world our work provides a clear framework to understand and describe baseflow in the context of climate and land use change ultimately these models show the potential

5026,slug tests are one of the most common field methods for estimating local hydraulic conductivity for fast and low cost characterization of aquifer heterogeneity in highly permeable zones underdamped responses identified by oscillations of the water level are generally observed several analytical solutions have been developed for modeling underdamped slug test responses interpreting these tests in fractured rocks can be challenging due to system complexity which ultimately raises questions about the appropriate model for interpreting a given dataset in order to obtain insights on this fundamental problem for slug test analyses in fractured rocks a complete evaluation on three transient solutions for linear radial and spherical flow configuration extended to include inertial and wellbore skin effects in a fully penetrating well is proposed a first comparison between these transient solutions and the classical steady state model shows that in some cases the latter may underestimate hydraulic conductivity next parameter sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were conducted on each solution to evaluate the classical problem of non uniqueness between models and parameters as expected the results from sensitivity analysis show that the hydraulic conductivity parameter is the most sensitive regardless of model configuration for specific storage sensitivity is important for the linear model moderate for the radial model and negligible for the spherical model for the skin factor however sensitivity is negligible for the linear model moderate for the radial model and most important for the spherical model these results were next confirmed by performing bayesian inferences using markov chain monte carlo technique to evaluate uncertainty on each parameter uncertainties appear significant for negligibly sensitive parameters but nearly insignificant for the most sensitive parameters for all flow configurations hydraulic conductivity appears however to be accurately estimated examples of interpretations for data collected in fractured rocks illustrate the application of these models and provide some recommendations keywords fractured media flow geometry underdamped slug test skin factor sensitivity and uncertainty analyses uniqueness problem 1 introduction slug tests are one of the most common conventional method used to estimate hydraulic properties of an aquifer this test method consists of a sudden perturbation of hydraulic head in the well where the subsequent pressure recovery is monitored through time in the well and when available nearby observation wells slug tests have been widely used to characterize the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity in several types of heterogeneous media mas pla et al 1997 maréchal et al 2004 maliva 2016 because these tests are relatively low cost fast and simple to realize this method is also convenient for contaminated sites because water does not need to be extracted i e no need to treat water and negligible movement of contaminants within the system at some experimental sites where numerous observation wells are located in a relatively small area slug tests have also been used for cross hole investigations e g audouin and bodin 2008 malama et al 2016 wang et al 2018 or hydraulic tomography e g brauchler et al 2010 brauchler et al 2011 paradis et al 2015 paradis et al 2016 which provides more confidence in hydraulic property distribution however slug test information is generally only available at the tested well due to limitations in both instrumentation and scale of investigation butler 1998 zhang et al 2019 overdamped and underdamped responses can be observed from slug tests according to the damping describing pressure recovery overdamped responses characterized by slow and monotonic recovery through time are classically observed in low to moderate permeability zones underdamped responses characterized by oscillatory signals due to inertial effects in the well may be observed in high permeability zones in porous e g butler and zhan 2004 cardiff et al 2011 malama et al 2011 and fractured rocks e g audouin and bodin 2008 quinn et al 2018 to analyze slug test responses numerous analytical solutions have been developed initially for overdamped responses and extended latter for underdamped responses e g butler 1998 springer and gelhar 1991 kipp 1985 butler and zhan 2004 malama et al 2011 liang et al 2018 simple analytical solutions for overdamped hvorslev 1951 bouwer and rice 1976 and underdamped responses springer and gelhar 1991 butler 1998 generally rely on the steady state assumption which neglects the storage coefficient rigorous but more complex solutions considering the transient condition have also been developed for overdamped e g cooper et al 1967 barker and black 1983 karasaki et al 1988 barker 1988 and underdamped responses e g kipp 1985 butler and zhan 2004 audouin and bodin 2008 malama et al 2011 steady state and transient solutions have been proposed for different aquifer conditions i e confined and unconfined isotropic and anisotropic and well conditions i e full and partial penetrating wells small and large diameter skin effect which in general assume homogeneous media and radial flow geometry to analyze slug tests performed in fractured rocks few solutions have been developed to account for discrete flow paths karasaki et al 1988 shapiro and hsieh 1998 double porosity barker and black 1983 dougherty and babu 1984 fractional flow barker 1988 audouin and bodin 2008 or composite media karasaki et al 1988 however these solutions have been barely used probably due to their complexity barker and black 1983 karasaki et al 1988 novakowski and bickerton 1997 shapiro and hsieh 1998 and or the difficulty to provide proper guidelines for slug test interpretation using for instance diagnostic plots e g beauheim et al 2004 therefore slug tests performed in fractured rocks or heterogeneous porous media are usually analyzed using classical solutions for homogeneous and radial flow geometry which may bias estimated parameters shapiro and hsieh 1998 beckie and harvey 2002 for instance beckie and harvey 2002 analyzed synthetic slug tests simulated in a heterogeneous system with the cooper et al 1967 solution developed for homogeneous media the authors highlighted that nearwell heterogeneity impacts the estimated storage more than the transmissivity near well heterogeneity could also have similar impacts compared to wellbore skin effects wellbore skin are indeed generally conceptualized as a zone at the vicinity of the well having different hydraulic properties compared to the reservoir a skin zone at the vicinity of the well may be attributed to different factors related to drilling or well completion i e gravel pack screen designs enhanced permeability of a damage zone or to the well evolution i e clogging due to mineral precipitation mud deposition the importance of skin effects on well test responses has been well recognized and discussed particularly in the petroleum literature e g horner 1951 van everdingen 1953 hawkins 1956 hurst et al 1969 jargon 1976 for slug test analysis wellbore skin effects have been incorporated in several solutions e g ramey et al 1975 faust and mercer 1984 kipp 1985 hyder et al 1994 yang and gates 1997 yeh and yang 2006 yeh and chen 2007 but only few models consider skin effects for underdamped slug test analysis kipp 1985 malama et al 2011 these models may however not be always appropriate to analyze underdamped slug test responses in fractured rocks because of the radial flow assumption indeed by extending the solution of barker 1988 to underdamped slug test responses audouin and bodin 2008 show that the flow geometry related to the flow dimension n is a sensitive parameter and underdamped responses are amplified for a flow dimension lower than two i e between linear and radial flow this solution however does not account for wellbore skin effects while flow geometry may be challenging to be identified from slug test data beauheim et al 2004 and more specifically for underdamped slug test responses due to short duration and numerous effects flow geometry has been demonstrated to be of critical importance audouin and bodin 2008 therefore conditions have been simplified in the present study by focusing on three main flow configurations generally encountered in fractured rocks linear radial and spherical three solutions initially proposed by karasaki et al 1988 have been extended to account for inertial effects with frictional losses in small diameter wells based on the work by butler and zhan 2004 due its impact at the tested well an infinitesimal wellbore skin factor has been implemented for each solution models were derived for transient flow to a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer of infinite extent such analytical solutions may be of interest for practitioners due to their relative simplicity and their low numbers of parameters analytical models are indeed effective tools for hydraulic parameter estimates practitioners usually choose models based on compromise between appropriateness of physical assumptions and convenience in the application e g often related to the number of model parameters for models with numerous parameters reliable parameter estimates can be the main challenge since the classical problem of non uniqueness arises e g barker and black 1983 dougherty and babu 1984 karasaki et al 1988 sensitivity analysis can hence be very useful to determine the most significant parameters and correlation between them as highlighted for instance by previous studies on slug test models mcelwee et al 1995 mcelwee 2002 audouin and bodin 2008 furthermore parameter uncertainty analysis performed on models can inform the accuracy of parameters cardiff et al 2011 although such analysis is scarce for slug test models good practice for model development should include both parameter sensitivity and uncertainty assessment consequently to obtain insights on the application of the three developed solutions a full evaluation has been performed and includes 1 a comparison with the classical steady state solution to evaluate differences in both hydraulic conductivity estimate and type curves characteristics 2 a complete sensitivity analysis for each flow configuration to evaluate most relevant parameters for each model and 3 an analysis using bayesian inferences through a markov chain monte carlo sampling method to evaluate parameter uncertainty for each flow configuration examples using field data are then used to provide guidance on the application of these solutions 2 model theory based on the momentum mass balance for frictional losses in small diameter wells proposed by butler and zhan 2004 three solutions initially developed by karasaki et al 1988 for overdamped slug tests have been extended for underdamped slug tests and account for skin effects these solutions are proposed for a fully penetrating well and for three distinct flow configurations linear radial and spherical flow geometry fig 1 linear flow configuration may correspond to a slug test performed in a channel or a vertical fracture fig 1 a radial flow configuration occurs for instance in a vertical well crossing a sub horizontal fracture fig 1 b and spherical flow configuration may be encountered in a dense and well connected fracture network with test performed in a small interval fig 1 c note that nonlinear effects which have been observed in some studies e g mcelwee and zenner 1998 quinn et al 2013 wang et al 2015 are not considered here diffusion equations for an infinite homogeneous confined and isotropic system with different flow configurations can be written in radial coordinates as follows for the linear flow problem 1 d with r x 1 s s h t k r h r for the radial flow problem 2 d with r x 2 y 2 2 s s h t k r r r h r and for the spherical flow problem 3 d with r x 2 y 2 z 2 3 s s h t k r 2 r r 2 h r where h l is the hydraulic head in the aquifer s s l 1 is the specific storage and k l t 1 is the hydraulic conductivity for simplicity the boundary conditions are defined such as 4 h r t 0 0 5 lim r h r t 0 where eq 4 considers an initial hydraulic head equal to zero in the reservoir and eq 5 describes an infinite flow region similarly to karasaki et al 1988 the general mass balance i e for linear radial and spherical describing exchange between the tested well and an isotropic reservoir can be written 6 c w dh t dt ka h r t r r r w where c w π r c 2 l2 is the storage capacity of the source r c l is the radius of well casing r w l is the well radius h l is the water level in the well and a l2 is the area open to flow which depends on flow configuration for spherical flow this parameter is a 4 π r w 2 for radial flow this parameter is defined as a 2 π r w b where b is the thickness of the aquifer or tested zone for linear flow this parameter is more challenging to define but can be assumed as a 2 b 2 barker 1988 where b l is the channel height and width or a 2 w d b where b l is the channel height and w d l is the channel width two distinct models which are the steady state and transient models can be defined to implement skin effects in the flow problem although a transient skin model is more rigorous it involves additional parameters that can be challenging to estimate novakowski 1989 especially for slug tests hence the steady state model has been considered here to reduce the number of parameters the dimensionless skin factor s w describing the effect of an infinitesimally thin skin at the tested well is introduced such as jargon 1976 kipp 1985 7 h w t h r w t s w r w h r t r r r w a positive skin factor corresponds to a decrease of permeability in the vicinity of the tested well while a negative skin factor corresponds to an increase of permeability to account for inertial effects and frictional losses the momentum balance in the tested well is defined following butler and zhan 2004 8 d 2 h t dt 2 8 ν l r c 2 l e dh t dt g l e h t g l e h w t where ν l2 t 1 is the kinematic viscosity of water g l2 t 1 is the gravitational acceleration l e l is the effective length of the water column in the well and l l is defined by butler 2002 as l l b 2 r c r w 4 where l l is the length of water column above the top of screen and b l is the aquifer thickness the initial conditions at the tested well are defined as 9 h t 0 h 0 10 dh t 0 dt v 0 where h 0 l is the initial slug displacement in the tested well and v 0 l t 1 is the initial velocity of water level in the well resulting from test initiation after mathematical development and simplification which is provided in appendix a the dimensionless solutions at the well were obtained in laplace space and the general form is 11 h p a b β p ω f l β v 0 s w ap b β p 2 ω f l p 1 s w p where h is the laplace transform of normalized deviation of water level in tested well from static conditions h t h 0 p is the laplace transform variable and the other normalized parameters are 12 β l e g ka r w c w 2 13 ω ar w s s c w 14 f l 8 ν lk r c 2 gr w 2 s s 15 v 0 r w c w v 0 kah 0 the parameters a and b depend on flow configuration for linear flow 1 d a 1 and b ω p for radial flow 2 d a k 0 ω p and b ω p k 1 ω p where k 0 and k 1 are the modified bessel functions of the second kind zeroth order and first order respectively for spherical flow 3 d a 1 and b 1 ω p in laplace domain however negative skin scenario cannot be represented by eq 7 due to the physical contradiction in the formulation hurst et al 1969 for a negative skin factor and radial flow regime one can use the effective well radius r we approximation see matthews and russell 1967 p 21 by setting s w to zero in the model and changing the well radius r w by the effective well radius r we 16 r we r w e s w this approximation was provided only for the radial flow geometry and cannot be used for linear and spherical flow configurations as a consequence only a positive skin effect was considered here to properly compare all models inversion of these solutions in time domain was achieved using the algorithm of den iseger 2006 for its accuracy and robustness den iseger 2006 al ajmi et al 2008 comparing with previous models in the literature the solution presented in eq 11 for the radial flow configuration without skin effect reduces to the solution of butler and zhan 2004 for a fully penetrating well by neglecting frictional losses the model reduces to the solution of kipp 1985 for the radial flow configuration by neglecting skin effect and considering an area open to flow as defined by barker 1988 the solutions reduce to the model of audouin and bodin 2008 when the flow dimension is fixed to n 1 for linear flow n 2 for radial flow and n 3 for spherical flow these scenarios are illustrated in fig 2 which also validate the proposed solutions 3 type curves to evaluate first the influences of hydraulic properties on the behavior of each model responses have been investigated for different parameter values and are presented in fig 3 type curves are illustrated in dimensionless form using the classical representation for underdamped slug test responses hydraulic head responses have been normalized according to h t h 0 and time has been normalized to t g le fig 3 a b c provides a series of types curves in response to changes in hydraulic conductivity for linear radial and spherical flow models fig 3 a b and c illustrates types curves in response to change of specific storage for the respective flow configurations the hydraulic conductivity values range from 3 2 10 3 to 7 3 10 2 m s 1 and the specific storage values range from 1 0 10 6 to 6 6 10 5 m 1 for all models to compare all models with the same hydraulic property values the area open to flow for each model has been calculated using b 1 m r w 0 05 m and w d 2 π m the parameter w d has only been used for the linear flow configuration where the area open to flow has been defined such as a 2 w d b from this preliminary investigation and consistently with previous studies hydraulic conductivity appears to be the parameter that mainly controls the shape of the curves in all models this is particularly true for the underdamped responses where increasing hydraulic conductivity lead to increases in the oscillatory responses results also indicate different behaviors depending on flow configuration where the linear flow model fig 3a presents the highest number of oscillatory responses while the spherical flow model fig 3c presents the fewest these results are consistent with the audouin and bodin 2008 study where the flow dimension n was identified to be the most sensitive parameter with an increase in the oscillatory responses for lower flow dimension concerning specific storage results show that the effect of this parameter strongly depends on flow configuration fig 3 a b and c indeed variability of the tested specific storage values leads to a strong variability in underdamped responses for the linear flow model fig 3 a a small variability for the radial flow model fig 3 b and negligible variability for the spherical flow model fig 3 c 4 comparison with the classical steady state model to analyze underdamped slug test responses the steady state model proposed by butler 1998 may often be preferred because this model only has two parameters i e le and k and is very simple to implement other solutions generally present more parameters and require numerical inversion in some circumstances however using a more appropriate solution like presented here may be required to reduce uncertainty in parameter estimates in this section it is thus proposed to evaluate differences between the steady state model of butler 1998 and the transient models in terms of the response shapes and hydraulic conductivity parameter estimates the proposed solutions are used as reference and hydraulic conductivity values estimated from the model of butler 1998 are compared with the hydraulic conductivity values used to generate the reference responses a series of slug test responses were generated using eq 11 for each flow configuration due to the strong impact of specific storage on the linear flow model fig 3 a one value was used to generate the curves for this model the simulated responses were then analyzed with the steady state model of butler 1998 using the least squares method to obtain the best fits the steady state model including frictional losses for a small diameter well using the hvorslev approximation for confined and isotropic aquifer conditions is given in butler 2002 for partial penetrating well the dimensionless damping parameter for this model is 17 c d g le r c 2 ln e 2 r w 1 e 2 r w 2 4 ke 4 ν l r c 2 g where e is the screen length and l l e 2 r c r w 4 for a fully penetrating well and according to the hvorslev approximation the logarithm is defined as ln r e r w where r e is the effective radius of slug test influence butler 1998 this parameter is generally set arbitrarily and has limited influence due to the logarithm butler 1998 hence we simply applied eq 17 for a partial penetrating well scenario by assuming e b to compare all models together some parameters were fixed such as r w 0 05 m r c 0 05 m l 5 m b 1 m w d 2 π m and v 0 0 m s 1 this configuration which may be representative of tests conducted between short intervals isolated by straddle packers was necessary to achieve a similar range in hydraulic conductivity to compare the differences between each generated curve with the best fit using the steady state solution the least squares residual is displayed as the square root of the sum of squared differences the lower least squares residual indicates a higher likeness between curves fig 4 shows the results obtained for the three flow configurations where the least squares residuals are presented as a function of the tested hydraulic conductivity values three main characteristics can be highlighted from these results first an increase in hydraulic conductivity leads to better similarity between the steady state model and transient models for all flow configurations second an increase in wellbore skin factor appears to impact the spherical flow model and decrease the difference with the steady state model third and most importantly the spherical flow model appears very similar to the steady state model since values of the least squares residuals are lower than 10 2 m however differences with linear and radial flow models appear more distinct in term of behaviors with stronger differences for the linear flow configuration the latter is indeed characterized by least squares residuals above 10 0 m fig 5 displays the hydraulic conductivity estimates with the steady state model k steady as function of the hydraulic conductivity values k true used to generate curves for transient models all plots present the case where k steady k true in dashed line the results show that for all flow configurations and tested values the steady state model appears to underestimate the hydraulic conductivity however the differences appear to be relatively similar whatever the flow configuration excepted for the spherical flow model where the wellbore skin factor has significant influences 5 sensitivity analysis previous investigations i e type curves and comparison with the steady state model highlighted different parameter sensitivity due to flow configuration to investigate model behaviors further a sensitivity analysis was conducted on each model to evaluate parameter influences on their behavior mcelwee et al 1995 kabala 2001 sensitivity analysis consists of evaluating change in model response by changing the magnitude of a single parameter and comparing the outcome with the reference case see for instance review of kabala 2001 following the procedure presented by mcelwee et al 1987 analysis for each model was performed according to normalized sensitivity for the general case the normalized sensitivity u θ of the parameter θ can be defined such as mcelwee et al 1995 18 u θ θ h t θ a differencing approximation can be used for the calculation of the partial derivative of the sensitivity equation as e g audouin and bodin 2008 19 h t θ h θ δ θ t h θ t δ θ where the small increment δ θ can be approximated such as δ θ 0 1 θ the sensitivity coefficient of a given parameter is then expressed as mcelwee 2002 20 r θ t 0 n u θ h θ δ θ t h θ t because the effective length parameter le only impacts frequency of the oscillatory responses only four parameters i e k s s s w and v 0 have been evaluated fig 6 presents sensitivity coefficients calculated for these four parameters for each flow configuration as function of the hydraulic conductivity fig 6 a b and c and specific storage fig 6 a b and c hydraulic conductivity k appears to be on average the most sensitive parameter independently of the flow configuration specific storage s s appears to be significant for the linear flow model but negligible for the spherical flow model inversely the wellbore skin factor s w appears to be significant for the spherical flow model but almost negligible for the linear flow model for the radial flow model the correlation between sensitivities to specific storage and wellbore skin factor is extremely high which means that these two parameters are difficult to estimate independently for this model the initial velocity v 0 which impacts only the early time appears to be of negligible influence for all flow configuration 6 uncertainty analysis the sensitivity analysis presented in fig 6 highlights that depending on flow configuration parameters have disparate influences on model behaviors consequently one should be concerned about parameter uncertainty in particular for those presenting low sensitivity an uncertainty analysis has thus been conducted on the three transient flow models in order to tackle this question and is presented in the following bayesian inference can be applied to evaluate parameter uncertainty for a given data set and model as a classical method for bayesian inference markov chain monte carlo mcmc can be used to approximate the posterior uncertainty of parameters the methodology used here is described as follows with some key concepts briefly reminded but the reader can refer to gilks et al 1996 or gamerman and lopes 2006 for more information on mcmc methods and bayesian inference theory similar to cardiff et al 2011 a set of artificial slug test data was generated for the three flow configurations with known parameters a small amount of gaussian noise was added to these synthetic data to produce artificial measurement errors using 21 h h θ where the noise is distributed according to normal probability distribution p g the probability of this synthetic data h for a given set of parameters true values θ is thus defined as 22 p h θ p g h h θ under the bayesian framework p h θ is expressed as the likelihood function which is given by 23 p h θ 1 2 π c exp 1 2 h h θ t c 1 h h θ where c is the covariance matrix of the prior errors related to the standard deviation σ of unknown measurement errors based on the bayes equation the likelihood p h θ is combined with the prior distribution over parameter p θ which represents the probability distribution about an uncertain parameter θ to yield the posterior distribution p θ h 24 p θ h p h θ p θ the bayesian inference applied to parameter estimation consists of evaluating the posterior probability distribution over parameters given the observation p θ h the prior distribution p θ is assumed to be uniform here e g hogg and foreman mackey 2018 the posterior distribution p θ h can thus be approximated numerically using mcmc sampling methods to evaluate the distribution of the likelihood function p h θ to obtain representative sampling from the distribution mcmc algorithms generate n random walkers to sample each parameter space with m number of steps to construct a sequence of random points i e chain of walkers the sequence where each point depends on the previous step i e markov chain has a density proportional to the posterior probability distribution among the different mcmc algorithms available the affine invariant ensemble sampler algorithm goodman and weare 2010 has been used for its robustness and because it has been implemented in an open source python package widely tested foreman mackey et al 2013 mcmc analysis of parameter distributions has been conducted for two slug test examples for each geometry configuration i e linear radial and spherical fig 7 presents the six synthetic cases with the hundred fits considered for the realizations example of mcmc random sampling of parameters conducted for the first case is presented in fig 8 with 100 walkers run for 2000 steps the walkers started in small gaussian distribution around the maximum likelihood values previously estimated using the least squares method after fewer than 125 steps the walkers seem no longer influenced by the initial guess and explore randomly the full posterior distribution a burn in period of 500 steps for each realization has thus been chosen for appropriate projections of the posterior probability distributions of the parameters results of the mcmc analysis are detailed in figs 9 11 for the three first synthetic cases related respectively to linear radial and spherical flow model fig 7 a b c similar realizations have been performed for the lower oscillation synthetic cases fig 7 d e f the different uncertainty results are summarized in fig 12 figs 9 11 present the corner plots representing the one and two dimensional projections of the posterior distributions for the hydraulic conductivity k specific storage s s skin effect s w and noise parameter σ the histograms along the diagonal represent the projection of each parameter posterior distribution which correspond to the range where the parameter provides reasonable fits to the data the other panels correspond to the joint projections of the posterior probability distributions between two parameters these two dimensional projections highlight the covariances between parameters the true values for these parameters are represented by black lines in these projections except for the hydraulic conductivity the parameter true values were identically fixed for each case i e s s 10 4 m 1 s w 2 and σ 0 003 from these projections the posterior distribution of k appears tightly centered around the maximum likelihood in a narrow range close to the true value figs 9 11 which means that this parameter can be estimated with low uncertainty for the three models by plotting the estimated k with the uncertainty defined such as standard deviation i e 68 of the value around the mean these results were confirmed for the different tested cases fig 12 the posterior distributions of s s and s w were however different for each model for linear flow model fig 9 the posterior distribution of s s appears tightly centered around the maximum likelihood in a narrow range close to the true value while the posterior distribution of s w seems more spread over the range of expected values i e 0 to 5 these results highlight that the linear flow model may allow proper estimation of the specific storage but with more uncertainty regarding the skin factor estimates fig 12 conversely for the spherical flow model fig 11 the posterior distribution of s s appears spread over the defined range while the posterior distribution of s w is centered around the maximum likelihood in a narrow range close to the true value uncertainties may thus be more important for s s estimates compared to s w for the spherical model fig 12 for the radial flow model fig 10 both posterior distributions of s s and s w are spread over the investigated ranges which suggest strong uncertainties for both these parameters the results obtained on s s for the radial flow geometry are consistent with previous studies highlighting strong difficulty to properly estimate this parameter at the tested well e g cardiff et al 2011 interestingly the distributions of s s and s w appear strongly correlated for the radial flow model fig 10 signifying that these parameters are difficult to evaluate separately for this model 7 model applications to field data in the previous sections considering main flow geometries that may be observed in fractured rocks three underdamped slug test solutions have been presented with discussion on parameters sensitivity and uncertainty a practical concern is how to choose the appropriate model for field data analysis the purpose of this section is to evaluate if flow geometry can be properly identified through analysis of slug test data using examples collected from a fractured rock field site the three models have been applied to three slug tests collected at the santa susana field laboratory ssfl located in southern california this site consists of a highly fractured and faulted formation of massive sandstone inter bedded with shales and siltstones cilona et al 2015 cilona et al 2016 slug tests were conducted in 1 5 m length intervals in the open holes r w 0 0635 m isolated by straddle packer equipment r c 0 0159 m using air pressure to initiate the slug test quinn et al 2012 the underdamped slug test data presented in fig 13 were collected from three boreholes located along a major fault zone borehole c10 zone 15 from 84 7 86 2 m bgs borehole c11 zone 29 from 171 9 173 4 m bgs and borehole c3 zone 13 from 116 6 118 2 m bgs the respective water column lengths for each tested zone were 57 3 m 83 2 m and 47 7 m for the initial water levels of 27 4 m 88 7 m and 69 m bgs small displacements for the slug tests were estimated using pressure gauge measurements of the applied air pressure these slug test responses were monitored by a pressure transducer positioned near the water level in the riser pipe details on equipment and procedures for these tests are described in quinn et al 2012 and quinn et al 2018 fig 13 presents the three slug test data in linear fig 13 a b c and semi log plots fig 13 a b c with the best fits obtained using the mcmc method table 1 provides a summary of the parameter estimates with the uncertainties resulting from these slug test analyses the first case c10 zone 15 has been analyzed using the linear flow model by fixing b 1 5 m and w d 2 π m which provided hydraulic parameters with k 2 4 10 5 m s 1 s s 8 9 10 5 m 1 and s w 2 5 table 1 this slug test response presents a linear flow behavior clearly identifiable based on the response shape that slowly recovered to the initial water level using other models i e radial or spherical for the analysis of this slug test data would provide hydraulic parameters leading to an unreasonably high specific storage value close to 1 m 1 in order to obtain acceptable model fits to the data such behavior which could only be interpreted using a linear flow model has apparently not been reported and interpreted previously in the literature for the two other slug tests c10 zone 15 and c11 zone 29 the situations were different both radial and spherical flow models can properly fit these slug test data with consistent hydraulic parameters using the radial flow model with b 1 5 m the parameters obtained were k 9 1 10 4 m s 1 s s 4 4 10 7 m 1 and s w 2 8 for c11 zone 29 and k 3 9 10 3 m s 1 s s 1 4 10 6 m 1 and s w 2 4 for c10 zone 13 table 1 using the spherical flow model the parameters obtained were k 3 8 10 3 m s 1 s s 1 2 10 6 m 1 and s w 2 5 for c11 zone 29 and k 1 5 10 2 m s 1 s s 7 8 10 7 m 1 and s w 2 3 for c10 zone 13 table 1 however using the linear flow model for these cases hydraulic parameters were inconsistent with low hydraulic conductivity values and very high specific storage values thus the difficulty lies in the choice between radial and spherical flow models it can be assumed that there is a higher likelihood to obtain a radial flow regime when testing horizontal fractures crossing a vertical well for a spherical model this flow regime may be observed only between packers in a dense and well connected fracture network in field cases one should use additional information e g geological and hydraulic to choose the appropriate model for instance information provided by pressure monitoring above and below the tested intervals can be used to control potential short circuiting that can be related to vertical hydraulic connection around the tested zone that would be better represented by the spherical flow model in cases where no apparent connection is measured the radial flow model may be more appropriate for the tests presented here regarding the water pressure measurements above and below the tested zone no short circuiting was observed for the c11 zone 29 while short circuiting was clearly identified for c3 zone 13 consequently the radial flow model may be preferred for the analysis of c11 zone 29 slug test and the spherical flow model may be preferred for the analysis of c3 zone 13 fig 14 presents a flow chart to help for selection of the appropriate flow model for slug tests performed in fractured rocks but there is no magic recipe and practitioners must always evaluate their results as critical a manner as possible 8 summary and conclusions three solutions for linear radial and spherical flow configurations initially proposed by karasaki et al 1988 for overdamped slug tests have been extended to underdamped slug tests by including wellbore skin and inertial effects based on work of butler and zhan 2004 at the tested well sensitivity analysis applied to these solutions shows that as classically known hydraulic conductivity is the most sensitive parameter however this paper shows that specific storage and skin factor have different sensitivities depending on flow configuration for the linear model specific storage appeared to be significantly sensitive while skin factor was negligible conversely the spherical flow model was sensitive to skin factor but specific storage was negligible for the radial model both specific storage and skin factor appear to be moderately sensitive and strongly correlated the uncertainty analysis using bayesian inferences confirmed these previous results by displaying more uncertainties on less sensitive parameters and inversely strong confidence with significantly sensitive parameters in particular hydraulic conductivity can be accurately estimated whatever the flow configuration the other parameters present more uncertainty in general but specific storage and skin factor values may be properly estimated for linear and spherical models respectively the presented solutions may be of interest for improved data analysis of underdamped slug tests in fractured rocks indeed a comparison between the three transient solutions and the classical steady state solution commonly used highlights discrepancies in the hydraulic conductivity estimates these discrepancies appear to be within one order of magnitude particularly for the spherical model where skin factor may be critical issues created by uncertain hydraulic conductivity estimates may be avoided using a more appropriate flow model as illustrated with field data examples the choice of using the linear flow model may be relatively straight forward due to unique behavior in water level responses to initial condition concerning the choice between radial and spherical flow models this mainly depends on both hydraulic and geological information in particular the spherical flow model could be only relevant for tests conducted between straddle packers since spherical flow regime is more likely to develop for tests performed from small intervals in a dense and well connected fracture network for this configuration hydraulic information above and below the tested interval is essential to choose the most appropriate model credit authorship contribution statement a dausse conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis visualization

5026,slug tests are one of the most common field methods for estimating local hydraulic conductivity for fast and low cost characterization of aquifer heterogeneity in highly permeable zones underdamped responses identified by oscillations of the water level are generally observed several analytical solutions have been developed for modeling underdamped slug test responses interpreting these tests in fractured rocks can be challenging due to system complexity which ultimately raises questions about the appropriate model for interpreting a given dataset in order to obtain insights on this fundamental problem for slug test analyses in fractured rocks a complete evaluation on three transient solutions for linear radial and spherical flow configuration extended to include inertial and wellbore skin effects in a fully penetrating well is proposed a first comparison between these transient solutions and the classical steady state model shows that in some cases the latter may underestimate hydraulic conductivity next parameter sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were conducted on each solution to evaluate the classical problem of non uniqueness between models and parameters as expected the results from sensitivity analysis show that the hydraulic conductivity parameter is the most sensitive regardless of model configuration for specific storage sensitivity is important for the linear model moderate for the radial model and negligible for the spherical model for the skin factor however sensitivity is negligible for the linear model moderate for the radial model and most important for the spherical model these results were next confirmed by performing bayesian inferences using markov chain monte carlo technique to evaluate uncertainty on each parameter uncertainties appear significant for negligibly sensitive parameters but nearly insignificant for the most sensitive parameters for all flow configurations hydraulic conductivity appears however to be accurately estimated examples of interpretations for data collected in fractured rocks illustrate the application of these models and provide some recommendations keywords fractured media flow geometry underdamped slug test skin factor sensitivity and uncertainty analyses uniqueness problem 1 introduction slug tests are one of the most common conventional method used to estimate hydraulic properties of an aquifer this test method consists of a sudden perturbation of hydraulic head in the well where the subsequent pressure recovery is monitored through time in the well and when available nearby observation wells slug tests have been widely used to characterize the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity in several types of heterogeneous media mas pla et al 1997 maréchal et al 2004 maliva 2016 because these tests are relatively low cost fast and simple to realize this method is also convenient for contaminated sites because water does not need to be extracted i e no need to treat water and negligible movement of contaminants within the system at some experimental sites where numerous observation wells are located in a relatively small area slug tests have also been used for cross hole investigations e g audouin and bodin 2008 malama et al 2016 wang et al 2018 or hydraulic tomography e g brauchler et al 2010 brauchler et al 2011 paradis et al 2015 paradis et al 2016 which provides more confidence in hydraulic property distribution however slug test information is generally only available at the tested well due to limitations in both instrumentation and scale of investigation butler 1998 zhang et al 2019 overdamped and underdamped responses can be observed from slug tests according to the damping describing pressure recovery overdamped responses characterized by slow and monotonic recovery through time are classically observed in low to moderate permeability zones underdamped responses characterized by oscillatory signals due to inertial effects in the well may be observed in high permeability zones in porous e g butler and zhan 2004 cardiff et al 2011 malama et al 2011 and fractured rocks e g audouin and bodin 2008 quinn et al 2018 to analyze slug test responses numerous analytical solutions have been developed initially for overdamped responses and extended latter for underdamped responses e g butler 1998 springer and gelhar 1991 kipp 1985 butler and zhan 2004 malama et al 2011 liang et al 2018 simple analytical solutions for overdamped hvorslev 1951 bouwer and rice 1976 and underdamped responses springer and gelhar 1991 butler 1998 generally rely on the steady state assumption which neglects the storage coefficient rigorous but more complex solutions considering the transient condition have also been developed for overdamped e g cooper et al 1967 barker and black 1983 karasaki et al 1988 barker 1988 and underdamped responses e g kipp 1985 butler and zhan 2004 audouin and bodin 2008 malama et al 2011 steady state and transient solutions have been proposed for different aquifer conditions i e confined and unconfined isotropic and anisotropic and well conditions i e full and partial penetrating wells small and large diameter skin effect which in general assume homogeneous media and radial flow geometry to analyze slug tests performed in fractured rocks few solutions have been developed to account for discrete flow paths karasaki et al 1988 shapiro and hsieh 1998 double porosity barker and black 1983 dougherty and babu 1984 fractional flow barker 1988 audouin and bodin 2008 or composite media karasaki et al 1988 however these solutions have been barely used probably due to their complexity barker and black 1983 karasaki et al 1988 novakowski and bickerton 1997 shapiro and hsieh 1998 and or the difficulty to provide proper guidelines for slug test interpretation using for instance diagnostic plots e g beauheim et al 2004 therefore slug tests performed in fractured rocks or heterogeneous porous media are usually analyzed using classical solutions for homogeneous and radial flow geometry which may bias estimated parameters shapiro and hsieh 1998 beckie and harvey 2002 for instance beckie and harvey 2002 analyzed synthetic slug tests simulated in a heterogeneous system with the cooper et al 1967 solution developed for homogeneous media the authors highlighted that nearwell heterogeneity impacts the estimated storage more than the transmissivity near well heterogeneity could also have similar impacts compared to wellbore skin effects wellbore skin are indeed generally conceptualized as a zone at the vicinity of the well having different hydraulic properties compared to the reservoir a skin zone at the vicinity of the well may be attributed to different factors related to drilling or well completion i e gravel pack screen designs enhanced permeability of a damage zone or to the well evolution i e clogging due to mineral precipitation mud deposition the importance of skin effects on well test responses has been well recognized and discussed particularly in the petroleum literature e g horner 1951 van everdingen 1953 hawkins 1956 hurst et al 1969 jargon 1976 for slug test analysis wellbore skin effects have been incorporated in several solutions e g ramey et al 1975 faust and mercer 1984 kipp 1985 hyder et al 1994 yang and gates 1997 yeh and yang 2006 yeh and chen 2007 but only few models consider skin effects for underdamped slug test analysis kipp 1985 malama et al 2011 these models may however not be always appropriate to analyze underdamped slug test responses in fractured rocks because of the radial flow assumption indeed by extending the solution of barker 1988 to underdamped slug test responses audouin and bodin 2008 show that the flow geometry related to the flow dimension n is a sensitive parameter and underdamped responses are amplified for a flow dimension lower than two i e between linear and radial flow this solution however does not account for wellbore skin effects while flow geometry may be challenging to be identified from slug test data beauheim et al 2004 and more specifically for underdamped slug test responses due to short duration and numerous effects flow geometry has been demonstrated to be of critical importance audouin and bodin 2008 therefore conditions have been simplified in the present study by focusing on three main flow configurations generally encountered in fractured rocks linear radial and spherical three solutions initially proposed by karasaki et al 1988 have been extended to account for inertial effects with frictional losses in small diameter wells based on the work by butler and zhan 2004 due its impact at the tested well an infinitesimal wellbore skin factor has been implemented for each solution models were derived for transient flow to a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer of infinite extent such analytical solutions may be of interest for practitioners due to their relative simplicity and their low numbers of parameters analytical models are indeed effective tools for hydraulic parameter estimates practitioners usually choose models based on compromise between appropriateness of physical assumptions and convenience in the application e g often related to the number of model parameters for models with numerous parameters reliable parameter estimates can be the main challenge since the classical problem of non uniqueness arises e g barker and black 1983 dougherty and babu 1984 karasaki et al 1988 sensitivity analysis can hence be very useful to determine the most significant parameters and correlation between them as highlighted for instance by previous studies on slug test models mcelwee et al 1995 mcelwee 2002 audouin and bodin 2008 furthermore parameter uncertainty analysis performed on models can inform the accuracy of parameters cardiff et al 2011 although such analysis is scarce for slug test models good practice for model development should include both parameter sensitivity and uncertainty assessment consequently to obtain insights on the application of the three developed solutions a full evaluation has been performed and includes 1 a comparison with the classical steady state solution to evaluate differences in both hydraulic conductivity estimate and type curves characteristics 2 a complete sensitivity analysis for each flow configuration to evaluate most relevant parameters for each model and 3 an analysis using bayesian inferences through a markov chain monte carlo sampling method to evaluate parameter uncertainty for each flow configuration examples using field data are then used to provide guidance on the application of these solutions 2 model theory based on the momentum mass balance for frictional losses in small diameter wells proposed by butler and zhan 2004 three solutions initially developed by karasaki et al 1988 for overdamped slug tests have been extended for underdamped slug tests and account for skin effects these solutions are proposed for a fully penetrating well and for three distinct flow configurations linear radial and spherical flow geometry fig 1 linear flow configuration may correspond to a slug test performed in a channel or a vertical fracture fig 1 a radial flow configuration occurs for instance in a vertical well crossing a sub horizontal fracture fig 1 b and spherical flow configuration may be encountered in a dense and well connected fracture network with test performed in a small interval fig 1 c note that nonlinear effects which have been observed in some studies e g mcelwee and zenner 1998 quinn et al 2013 wang et al 2015 are not considered here diffusion equations for an infinite homogeneous confined and isotropic system with different flow configurations can be written in radial coordinates as follows for the linear flow problem 1 d with r x 1 s s h t k r h r for the radial flow problem 2 d with r x 2 y 2 2 s s h t k r r r h r and for the spherical flow problem 3 d with r x 2 y 2 z 2 3 s s h t k r 2 r r 2 h r where h l is the hydraulic head in the aquifer s s l 1 is the specific storage and k l t 1 is the hydraulic conductivity for simplicity the boundary conditions are defined such as 4 h r t 0 0 5 lim r h r t 0 where eq 4 considers an initial hydraulic head equal to zero in the reservoir and eq 5 describes an infinite flow region similarly to karasaki et al 1988 the general mass balance i e for linear radial and spherical describing exchange between the tested well and an isotropic reservoir can be written 6 c w dh t dt ka h r t r r r w where c w π r c 2 l2 is the storage capacity of the source r c l is the radius of well casing r w l is the well radius h l is the water level in the well and a l2 is the area open to flow which depends on flow configuration for spherical flow this parameter is a 4 π r w 2 for radial flow this parameter is defined as a 2 π r w b where b is the thickness of the aquifer or tested zone for linear flow this parameter is more challenging to define but can be assumed as a 2 b 2 barker 1988 where b l is the channel height and width or a 2 w d b where b l is the channel height and w d l is the channel width two distinct models which are the steady state and transient models can be defined to implement skin effects in the flow problem although a transient skin model is more rigorous it involves additional parameters that can be challenging to estimate novakowski 1989 especially for slug tests hence the steady state model has been considered here to reduce the number of parameters the dimensionless skin factor s w describing the effect of an infinitesimally thin skin at the tested well is introduced such as jargon 1976 kipp 1985 7 h w t h r w t s w r w h r t r r r w a positive skin factor corresponds to a decrease of permeability in the vicinity of the tested well while a negative skin factor corresponds to an increase of permeability to account for inertial effects and frictional losses the momentum balance in the tested well is defined following butler and zhan 2004 8 d 2 h t dt 2 8 ν l r c 2 l e dh t dt g l e h t g l e h w t where ν l2 t 1 is the kinematic viscosity of water g l2 t 1 is the gravitational acceleration l e l is the effective length of the water column in the well and l l is defined by butler 2002 as l l b 2 r c r w 4 where l l is the length of water column above the top of screen and b l is the aquifer thickness the initial conditions at the tested well are defined as 9 h t 0 h 0 10 dh t 0 dt v 0 where h 0 l is the initial slug displacement in the tested well and v 0 l t 1 is the initial velocity of water level in the well resulting from test initiation after mathematical development and simplification which is provided in appendix a the dimensionless solutions at the well were obtained in laplace space and the general form is 11 h p a b β p ω f l β v 0 s w ap b β p 2 ω f l p 1 s w p where h is the laplace transform of normalized deviation of water level in tested well from static conditions h t h 0 p is the laplace transform variable and the other normalized parameters are 12 β l e g ka r w c w 2 13 ω ar w s s c w 14 f l 8 ν lk r c 2 gr w 2 s s 15 v 0 r w c w v 0 kah 0 the parameters a and b depend on flow configuration for linear flow 1 d a 1 and b ω p for radial flow 2 d a k 0 ω p and b ω p k 1 ω p where k 0 and k 1 are the modified bessel functions of the second kind zeroth order and first order respectively for spherical flow 3 d a 1 and b 1 ω p in laplace domain however negative skin scenario cannot be represented by eq 7 due to the physical contradiction in the formulation hurst et al 1969 for a negative skin factor and radial flow regime one can use the effective well radius r we approximation see matthews and russell 1967 p 21 by setting s w to zero in the model and changing the well radius r w by the effective well radius r we 16 r we r w e s w this approximation was provided only for the radial flow geometry and cannot be used for linear and spherical flow configurations as a consequence only a positive skin effect was considered here to properly compare all models inversion of these solutions in time domain was achieved using the algorithm of den iseger 2006 for its accuracy and robustness den iseger 2006 al ajmi et al 2008 comparing with previous models in the literature the solution presented in eq 11 for the radial flow configuration without skin effect reduces to the solution of butler and zhan 2004 for a fully penetrating well by neglecting frictional losses the model reduces to the solution of kipp 1985 for the radial flow configuration by neglecting skin effect and considering an area open to flow as defined by barker 1988 the solutions reduce to the model of audouin and bodin 2008 when the flow dimension is fixed to n 1 for linear flow n 2 for radial flow and n 3 for spherical flow these scenarios are illustrated in fig 2 which also validate the proposed solutions 3 type curves to evaluate first the influences of hydraulic properties on the behavior of each model responses have been investigated for different parameter values and are presented in fig 3 type curves are illustrated in dimensionless form using the classical representation for underdamped slug test responses hydraulic head responses have been normalized according to h t h 0 and time has been normalized to t g le fig 3 a b c provides a series of types curves in response to changes in hydraulic conductivity for linear radial and spherical flow models fig 3 a b and c illustrates types curves in response to change of specific storage for the respective flow configurations the hydraulic conductivity values range from 3 2 10 3 to 7 3 10 2 m s 1 and the specific storage values range from 1 0 10 6 to 6 6 10 5 m 1 for all models to compare all models with the same hydraulic property values the area open to flow for each model has been calculated using b 1 m r w 0 05 m and w d 2 π m the parameter w d has only been used for the linear flow configuration where the area open to flow has been defined such as a 2 w d b from this preliminary investigation and consistently with previous studies hydraulic conductivity appears to be the parameter that mainly controls the shape of the curves in all models this is particularly true for the underdamped responses where increasing hydraulic conductivity lead to increases in the oscillatory responses results also indicate different behaviors depending on flow configuration where the linear flow model fig 3a presents the highest number of oscillatory responses while the spherical flow model fig 3c presents the fewest these results are consistent with the audouin and bodin 2008 study where the flow dimension n was identified to be the most sensitive parameter with an increase in the oscillatory responses for lower flow dimension concerning specific storage results show that the effect of this parameter strongly depends on flow configuration fig 3 a b and c indeed variability of the tested specific storage values leads to a strong variability in underdamped responses for the linear flow model fig 3 a a small variability for the radial flow model fig 3 b and negligible variability for the spherical flow model fig 3 c 4 comparison with the classical steady state model to analyze underdamped slug test responses the steady state model proposed by butler 1998 may often be preferred because this model only has two parameters i e le and k and is very simple to implement other solutions generally present more parameters and require numerical inversion in some circumstances however using a more appropriate solution like presented here may be required to reduce uncertainty in parameter estimates in this section it is thus proposed to evaluate differences between the steady state model of butler 1998 and the transient models in terms of the response shapes and hydraulic conductivity parameter estimates the proposed solutions are used as reference and hydraulic conductivity values estimated from the model of butler 1998 are compared with the hydraulic conductivity values used to generate the reference responses a series of slug test responses were generated using eq 11 for each flow configuration due to the strong impact of specific storage on the linear flow model fig 3 a one value was used to generate the curves for this model the simulated responses were then analyzed with the steady state model of butler 1998 using the least squares method to obtain the best fits the steady state model including frictional losses for a small diameter well using the hvorslev approximation for confined and isotropic aquifer conditions is given in butler 2002 for partial penetrating well the dimensionless damping parameter for this model is 17 c d g le r c 2 ln e 2 r w 1 e 2 r w 2 4 ke 4 ν l r c 2 g where e is the screen length and l l e 2 r c r w 4 for a fully penetrating well and according to the hvorslev approximation the logarithm is defined as ln r e r w where r e is the effective radius of slug test influence butler 1998 this parameter is generally set arbitrarily and has limited influence due to the logarithm butler 1998 hence we simply applied eq 17 for a partial penetrating well scenario by assuming e b to compare all models together some parameters were fixed such as r w 0 05 m r c 0 05 m l 5 m b 1 m w d 2 π m and v 0 0 m s 1 this configuration which may be representative of tests conducted between short intervals isolated by straddle packers was necessary to achieve a similar range in hydraulic conductivity to compare the differences between each generated curve with the best fit using the steady state solution the least squares residual is displayed as the square root of the sum of squared differences the lower least squares residual indicates a higher likeness between curves fig 4 shows the results obtained for the three flow configurations where the least squares residuals are presented as a function of the tested hydraulic conductivity values three main characteristics can be highlighted from these results first an increase in hydraulic conductivity leads to better similarity between the steady state model and transient models for all flow configurations second an increase in wellbore skin factor appears to impact the spherical flow model and decrease the difference with the steady state model third and most importantly the spherical flow model appears very similar to the steady state model since values of the least squares residuals are lower than 10 2 m however differences with linear and radial flow models appear more distinct in term of behaviors with stronger differences for the linear flow configuration the latter is indeed characterized by least squares residuals above 10 0 m fig 5 displays the hydraulic conductivity estimates with the steady state model k steady as function of the hydraulic conductivity values k true used to generate curves for transient models all plots present the case where k steady k true in dashed line the results show that for all flow configurations and tested values the steady state model appears to underestimate the hydraulic conductivity however the differences appear to be relatively similar whatever the flow configuration excepted for the spherical flow model where the wellbore skin factor has significant influences 5 sensitivity analysis previous investigations i e type curves and comparison with the steady state model highlighted different parameter sensitivity due to flow configuration to investigate model behaviors further a sensitivity analysis was conducted on each model to evaluate parameter influences on their behavior mcelwee et al 1995 kabala 2001 sensitivity analysis consists of evaluating change in model response by changing the magnitude of a single parameter and comparing the outcome with the reference case see for instance review of kabala 2001 following the procedure presented by mcelwee et al 1987 analysis for each model was performed according to normalized sensitivity for the general case the normalized sensitivity u θ of the parameter θ can be defined such as mcelwee et al 1995 18 u θ θ h t θ a differencing approximation can be used for the calculation of the partial derivative of the sensitivity equation as e g audouin and bodin 2008 19 h t θ h θ δ θ t h θ t δ θ where the small increment δ θ can be approximated such as δ θ 0 1 θ the sensitivity coefficient of a given parameter is then expressed as mcelwee 2002 20 r θ t 0 n u θ h θ δ θ t h θ t because the effective length parameter le only impacts frequency of the oscillatory responses only four parameters i e k s s s w and v 0 have been evaluated fig 6 presents sensitivity coefficients calculated for these four parameters for each flow configuration as function of the hydraulic conductivity fig 6 a b and c and specific storage fig 6 a b and c hydraulic conductivity k appears to be on average the most sensitive parameter independently of the flow configuration specific storage s s appears to be significant for the linear flow model but negligible for the spherical flow model inversely the wellbore skin factor s w appears to be significant for the spherical flow model but almost negligible for the linear flow model for the radial flow model the correlation between sensitivities to specific storage and wellbore skin factor is extremely high which means that these two parameters are difficult to estimate independently for this model the initial velocity v 0 which impacts only the early time appears to be of negligible influence for all flow configuration 6 uncertainty analysis the sensitivity analysis presented in fig 6 highlights that depending on flow configuration parameters have disparate influences on model behaviors consequently one should be concerned about parameter uncertainty in particular for those presenting low sensitivity an uncertainty analysis has thus been conducted on the three transient flow models in order to tackle this question and is presented in the following bayesian inference can be applied to evaluate parameter uncertainty for a given data set and model as a classical method for bayesian inference markov chain monte carlo mcmc can be used to approximate the posterior uncertainty of parameters the methodology used here is described as follows with some key concepts briefly reminded but the reader can refer to gilks et al 1996 or gamerman and lopes 2006 for more information on mcmc methods and bayesian inference theory similar to cardiff et al 2011 a set of artificial slug test data was generated for the three flow configurations with known parameters a small amount of gaussian noise was added to these synthetic data to produce artificial measurement errors using 21 h h θ where the noise is distributed according to normal probability distribution p g the probability of this synthetic data h for a given set of parameters true values θ is thus defined as 22 p h θ p g h h θ under the bayesian framework p h θ is expressed as the likelihood function which is given by 23 p h θ 1 2 π c exp 1 2 h h θ t c 1 h h θ where c is the covariance matrix of the prior errors related to the standard deviation σ of unknown measurement errors based on the bayes equation the likelihood p h θ is combined with the prior distribution over parameter p θ which represents the probability distribution about an uncertain parameter θ to yield the posterior distribution p θ h 24 p θ h p h θ p θ the bayesian inference applied to parameter estimation consists of evaluating the posterior probability distribution over parameters given the observation p θ h the prior distribution p θ is assumed to be uniform here e g hogg and foreman mackey 2018 the posterior distribution p θ h can thus be approximated numerically using mcmc sampling methods to evaluate the distribution of the likelihood function p h θ to obtain representative sampling from the distribution mcmc algorithms generate n random walkers to sample each parameter space with m number of steps to construct a sequence of random points i e chain of walkers the sequence where each point depends on the previous step i e markov chain has a density proportional to the posterior probability distribution among the different mcmc algorithms available the affine invariant ensemble sampler algorithm goodman and weare 2010 has been used for its robustness and because it has been implemented in an open source python package widely tested foreman mackey et al 2013 mcmc analysis of parameter distributions has been conducted for two slug test examples for each geometry configuration i e linear radial and spherical fig 7 presents the six synthetic cases with the hundred fits considered for the realizations example of mcmc random sampling of parameters conducted for the first case is presented in fig 8 with 100 walkers run for 2000 steps the walkers started in small gaussian distribution around the maximum likelihood values previously estimated using the least squares method after fewer than 125 steps the walkers seem no longer influenced by the initial guess and explore randomly the full posterior distribution a burn in period of 500 steps for each realization has thus been chosen for appropriate projections of the posterior probability distributions of the parameters results of the mcmc analysis are detailed in figs 9 11 for the three first synthetic cases related respectively to linear radial and spherical flow model fig 7 a b c similar realizations have been performed for the lower oscillation synthetic cases fig 7 d e f the different uncertainty results are summarized in fig 12 figs 9 11 present the corner plots representing the one and two dimensional projections of the posterior distributions for the hydraulic conductivity k specific storage s s skin effect s w and noise parameter σ the histograms along the diagonal represent the projection of each parameter posterior distribution which correspond to the range where the parameter provides reasonable fits to the data the other panels correspond to the joint projections of the posterior probability distributions between two parameters these two dimensional projections highlight the covariances between parameters the true values for these parameters are represented by black lines in these projections except for the hydraulic conductivity the parameter true values were identically fixed for each case i e s s 10 4 m 1 s w 2 and σ 0 003 from these projections the posterior distribution of k appears tightly centered around the maximum likelihood in a narrow range close to the true value figs 9 11 which means that this parameter can be estimated with low uncertainty for the three models by plotting the estimated k with the uncertainty defined such as standard deviation i e 68 of the value around the mean these results were confirmed for the different tested cases fig 12 the posterior distributions of s s and s w were however different for each model for linear flow model fig 9 the posterior distribution of s s appears tightly centered around the maximum likelihood in a narrow range close to the true value while the posterior distribution of s w seems more spread over the range of expected values i e 0 to 5 these results highlight that the linear flow model may allow proper estimation of the specific storage but with more uncertainty regarding the skin factor estimates fig 12 conversely for the spherical flow model fig 11 the posterior distribution of s s appears spread over the defined range while the posterior distribution of s w is centered around the maximum likelihood in a narrow range close to the true value uncertainties may thus be more important for s s estimates compared to s w for the spherical model fig 12 for the radial flow model fig 10 both posterior distributions of s s and s w are spread over the investigated ranges which suggest strong uncertainties for both these parameters the results obtained on s s for the radial flow geometry are consistent with previous studies highlighting strong difficulty to properly estimate this parameter at the tested well e g cardiff et al 2011 interestingly the distributions of s s and s w appear strongly correlated for the radial flow model fig 10 signifying that these parameters are difficult to evaluate separately for this model 7 model applications to field data in the previous sections considering main flow geometries that may be observed in fractured rocks three underdamped slug test solutions have been presented with discussion on parameters sensitivity and uncertainty a practical concern is how to choose the appropriate model for field data analysis the purpose of this section is to evaluate if flow geometry can be properly identified through analysis of slug test data using examples collected from a fractured rock field site the three models have been applied to three slug tests collected at the santa susana field laboratory ssfl located in southern california this site consists of a highly fractured and faulted formation of massive sandstone inter bedded with shales and siltstones cilona et al 2015 cilona et al 2016 slug tests were conducted in 1 5 m length intervals in the open holes r w 0 0635 m isolated by straddle packer equipment r c 0 0159 m using air pressure to initiate the slug test quinn et al 2012 the underdamped slug test data presented in fig 13 were collected from three boreholes located along a major fault zone borehole c10 zone 15 from 84 7 86 2 m bgs borehole c11 zone 29 from 171 9 173 4 m bgs and borehole c3 zone 13 from 116 6 118 2 m bgs the respective water column lengths for each tested zone were 57 3 m 83 2 m and 47 7 m for the initial water levels of 27 4 m 88 7 m and 69 m bgs small displacements for the slug tests were estimated using pressure gauge measurements of the applied air pressure these slug test responses were monitored by a pressure transducer positioned near the water level in the riser pipe details on equipment and procedures for these tests are described in quinn et al 2012 and quinn et al 2018 fig 13 presents the three slug test data in linear fig 13 a b c and semi log plots fig 13 a b c with the best fits obtained using the mcmc method table 1 provides a summary of the parameter estimates with the uncertainties resulting from these slug test analyses the first case c10 zone 15 has been analyzed using the linear flow model by fixing b 1 5 m and w d 2 π m which provided hydraulic parameters with k 2 4 10 5 m s 1 s s 8 9 10 5 m 1 and s w 2 5 table 1 this slug test response presents a linear flow behavior clearly identifiable based on the response shape that slowly recovered to the initial water level using other models i e radial or spherical for the analysis of this slug test data would provide hydraulic parameters leading to an unreasonably high specific storage value close to 1 m 1 in order to obtain acceptable model fits to the data such behavior which could only be interpreted using a linear flow model has apparently not been reported and interpreted previously in the literature for the two other slug tests c10 zone 15 and c11 zone 29 the situations were different both radial and spherical flow models can properly fit these slug test data with consistent hydraulic parameters using the radial flow model with b 1 5 m the parameters obtained were k 9 1 10 4 m s 1 s s 4 4 10 7 m 1 and s w 2 8 for c11 zone 29 and k 3 9 10 3 m s 1 s s 1 4 10 6 m 1 and s w 2 4 for c10 zone 13 table 1 using the spherical flow model the parameters obtained were k 3 8 10 3 m s 1 s s 1 2 10 6 m 1 and s w 2 5 for c11 zone 29 and k 1 5 10 2 m s 1 s s 7 8 10 7 m 1 and s w 2 3 for c10 zone 13 table 1 however using the linear flow model for these cases hydraulic parameters were inconsistent with low hydraulic conductivity values and very high specific storage values thus the difficulty lies in the choice between radial and spherical flow models it can be assumed that there is a higher likelihood to obtain a radial flow regime when testing horizontal fractures crossing a vertical well for a spherical model this flow regime may be observed only between packers in a dense and well connected fracture network in field cases one should use additional information e g geological and hydraulic to choose the appropriate model for instance information provided by pressure monitoring above and below the tested intervals can be used to control potential short circuiting that can be related to vertical hydraulic connection around the tested zone that would be better represented by the spherical flow model in cases where no apparent connection is measured the radial flow model may be more appropriate for the tests presented here regarding the water pressure measurements above and below the tested zone no short circuiting was observed for the c11 zone 29 while short circuiting was clearly identified for c3 zone 13 consequently the radial flow model may be preferred for the analysis of c11 zone 29 slug test and the spherical flow model may be preferred for the analysis of c3 zone 13 fig 14 presents a flow chart to help for selection of the appropriate flow model for slug tests performed in fractured rocks but there is no magic recipe and practitioners must always evaluate their results as critical a manner as possible 8 summary and conclusions three solutions for linear radial and spherical flow configurations initially proposed by karasaki et al 1988 for overdamped slug tests have been extended to underdamped slug tests by including wellbore skin and inertial effects based on work of butler and zhan 2004 at the tested well sensitivity analysis applied to these solutions shows that as classically known hydraulic conductivity is the most sensitive parameter however this paper shows that specific storage and skin factor have different sensitivities depending on flow configuration for the linear model specific storage appeared to be significantly sensitive while skin factor was negligible conversely the spherical flow model was sensitive to skin factor but specific storage was negligible for the radial model both specific storage and skin factor appear to be moderately sensitive and strongly correlated the uncertainty analysis using bayesian inferences confirmed these previous results by displaying more uncertainties on less sensitive parameters and inversely strong confidence with significantly sensitive parameters in particular hydraulic conductivity can be accurately estimated whatever the flow configuration the other parameters present more uncertainty in general but specific storage and skin factor values may be properly estimated for linear and spherical models respectively the presented solutions may be of interest for improved data analysis of underdamped slug tests in fractured rocks indeed a comparison between the three transient solutions and the classical steady state solution commonly used highlights discrepancies in the hydraulic conductivity estimates these discrepancies appear to be within one order of magnitude particularly for the spherical model where skin factor may be critical issues created by uncertain hydraulic conductivity estimates may be avoided using a more appropriate flow model as illustrated with field data examples the choice of using the linear flow model may be relatively straight forward due to unique behavior in water level responses to initial condition concerning the choice between radial and spherical flow models this mainly depends on both hydraulic and geological information in particular the spherical flow model could be only relevant for tests conducted between straddle packers since spherical flow regime is more likely to develop for tests performed from small intervals in a dense and well connected fracture network for this configuration hydraulic information above and below the tested interval is essential to choose the most appropriate model credit authorship contribution statement a dausse conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis visualization

5027,meteorological droughts due to the concurrent occurrence of low precipitation and high temperature events can lead to severe negative impacts on agriculture economy ecosystem and society this study proposes a novel framework to characterize such drought conditions based on the joint variability of precipitation temperature particularly under climate change generalized hierarchical linear model is used to downscale precipitation and temperature at multiple stations from the outputs of nine general circulation models gcms under representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 a bivariate drought index called precipitation temperature deciles index ptdi is developed using copulas to assess changes in future dry hot conditions the methodology is applied to the lake urmia basin located in a semi arid region in the northwest of iran lake urmia the sixth largest salt lake in the world at the original size has shrunk dramatically causing environmental and socioeconomic disruptions results suggest that the climate of the region is projected to shift toward drier hotter conditions in the future the multi model ensemble means of all gcms shows an increase of 4 c in the regional temperature and 25 mm 8 decrease in precipitation in 2060 2080 based on rcp8 5 the magnitude of climate induced water deficit is projected to increase under all future scenarios according to the ptdi projected changes in the number of extremely dry hot months in 2060 2080 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 relative to the historical period vary between 2 4 and 7 3 and 4 5 13 2 respectively this condition is unfavorable for the revival of the endangered lake while maintaining the agricultural activities in the region keywords climate change impact precipitation temperature bivariate drought index copula lake urmia 1 introduction drought is a natural hazard with significant negative impacts on agriculture economy ecosystem and society prolonged severe droughts can eventually lead to disasters such as famine death and mass immigration particularly in developing countries wilhite 2005 godfray et al 2010 drought characterization plays a pivotal role in planning and decision making for drought preparedness mitigation and response thereby minimizing food financial and socio economic crisis following the theory of runs proposed by yevjevich 1967 drought indices have become the most widely used quantitative measures of drought that take one or several variables into account such as precipitation and evapotranspiration to characterize drought zargar et al 2011 since drought is an intrinsically complicated phenomenon it does not have a single universal definition heim 2002 therefore drought definition and quantification through indices is a context dependent matter droughts are categorized into four types from the operational point of view meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic wilhite and glantz 1985 meteorological drought which is the focus of this research stems from water deficiency driven by atmospheric conditions such as precipitation decline and temperature rise over a specific region and period of time dracup et al 1980 in other words meteorological drought is governed by dry weather patterns which cannot be managed or controlled besides it can instigate soil moisture deficit i e agricultural drought water resources shortage i e hydrological drought and eventually imbalance between water supply and demand i e socio economic drought on this ground much effort has been devoted to developing meteorological drought indices heim 2002 keyantash and dracup 2002 zargar et al 2011 the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 is a popular drought index which is widely used worldwide hayes et al 2011 the spi is solely based on precipitation making the index very easy to calculate and implement the primary motivation behind the spi was to demonstrate that drought duration severity and frequency are dependent upon the time scale over which precipitation deficit accumulates a fact which had been highlighted by previous studies e g dracup et al 1980 hence the explicit time scale of the spi can allow for taking the lagged effects of precipitation deficiency into account a limitation of the spi that seems to be overlooked in previous studies however is that the index cannot properly separate seasonality from drought a viable index should be able to detect drought regardless of whether it is summer or winter narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 this is especially important in semi arid and arid regions where precipitation is not distributed uniformly over the year and summers are normally much drier than winters the deciles index gibbs and maher 1967 is another precipitation based meteorological drought index which can be applied to any desired period and time scale zargar et al 2011 the index divides the distribution of precipitation into ten parts i e deciles the first decile range represents the set of precipitation values that are not exceeded by the lowest 10 of the observed precipitation values according to the australian bureau of meteorology which classifies the decile ranges into five groups table 1 an area experiences precipitation deficiency if precipitation falls in the first decile range for at least three months of the year nagarajan 2010 drought indices founded solely on precipitation including the spi and deciles index are limited by at least two main assumptions 1 meteorological drought is governed by precipitation variability only and the effects of other variables such as temperature are negligible and 2 the probability distributions of the other variables are stationary however it is now widely recognized that drought characteristics are associated with both precipitation and temperature patterns e g williams et al 2012 griffin and anchukaitis 2014 hlaváčová et al 2018 yang et al 2020 in particular the effects of temperature on droughts can be more pronounced under global warming and climate change according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc s fifth assessment report the means and high extremes of temperature are projected to increase over most land areas around the world and precipitation deficit may increase over many regions in the future ipcc 2018 the combined impacts of extreme precipitation temperature events can result in severe consequences a low precipitation period along with above average temperature can exacerbate water shortages and drought conditions for example aghakouchak et al 2014 showed that drought analysis based solely on precipitation ignoring the role of temperature would substantially underestimate the 2014 california drought event the individual return period estimates of precipitation and temperature were 24 and 120 years respectively while the joint precipitation temperature return period was 200 years to consider the role of temperature in drought characterization meteorological indices combine or compare the amount of water received from the atmosphere through precipitation with the maximum amount of water transferred to the atmosphere by potential evapotranspiration tsakiris and vangelis 2005 used the notion of the aridity index to develop the reconnaissance drought index rdi which is based on the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration e p vicente serrano et al 2010 extended the spi to the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei by applying a modified methodology of the spi to the difference between precipitation and e p rather than precipitation alone in this regard the spei implements climatic water balance to determine water deficiency resulted from atmospheric processes some researchers have suggested that e p can be the most influential variable in the onset and persistence of drought from this perspective the evaporative stress index esi anderson et al 2007a 2007b and the evaporative demand drought index eddi hobbins et al 2016 mcevoy et al 2016 are developed upon e p such that they are independent of precipitation from agricultural viewpoint the difference between actual evapotranspiration e a and e p called evaporative deficit is proposed for analyzing drought since high evaporative deficit can indicate that crop is under water stress vicente serrano et al 2015 2018 the evapotranspiration deficit index etdi narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 and the standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi kim and rhee 2016 are among drought indices involving e a e a is a function of climate crop and soil characteristics and agricultural management practices as a result estimating e a is a complicated task requiring climate data soil moisture information and land surface models on the other hand e p is only a function of climatic conditions allen et al 1998 kim and rhee 2016 hence e p can be considered as a suitable variable for quantifying meteorological drought since it can allow for comparing atmospheric water demand at different regions in different seasons beguería et al 2014 regardless of local agricultural and management factors although estimating e p is considerably simpler than estimating e a it is still not clear to what extent the choice of e p calculation method can influence drought indices for example van der schrier et al 2011 and dai 2011 suggested that the palmer drought severity index pdsi is not highly sensitive to either the thornthwaite or penman monteith equations on the contrary beguería et al 2014 found that the e p equation used for calculating the spei can be important in semi arid and arid regions it is widely recognized that precipitation and temperature have great impacts on the environment energy demand human health industrial and agricultural activities tencer et al 2014 they govern droughts and water shortages through changes in the runoff volume groundwater recharge evapotranspiration soil moisture and snow najafi et al 2017 precipitation and temperature also play a pivotal role in crop production lobell and asner 2003 lobell et al 2007 lobell and field 2007 cooper et al 2008 previous studies imply that the proper understanding of extreme climate related events requires a careful examination of interdependencies between the two variables trenberth and shea 2005 showed that negative correlations between monthly precipitation and temperature dominate mid latitudes as higher temperatures favor dry conditions with more sunshine i e less cloud cover and less evaporative cooling while wet summers are generally cool on the contrary positive correlations dominate high latitudes in winter as warm moist advection in extratropical cyclones favors wet conditions and the moisture capacity of the air increases with rising temperature huang et al 2009 found significant negative correlations at annual scale in china cong and brady 2012 detected negative correlations at monthly scale in sweden tencer et al 2014 found significant positive correlations at daily scale between heavy precipitation events and warm nights or warm days at more than half of the stations over canada singh et al 2019 analyzed spatial variations in interdependencies between temperature and precipitation in canada and discovered positive correlations over higher latitudes sub arctic regions but negative correlations in the prairie provinces the association between precipitation and temperature highlights the importance of considering the joint behavior of the variables besides their individual variations nevertheless a methodology to systematically characterize meteorological drought based on the joint variability of precipitation temperature is not developed yet the investigation of precipitation temperature dependence structure involves the application of multivariate techniques traditional multivariate analysis methods such as multivariate gaussian and gamma distributions assume that the constituting variables follow the same type of distributions copulas are multivariate probability distribution functions pdfs which provide a flexible framework to couple the univariate distributions of correlated random variables copula can model the dependence structure among hydroclimate variables regardless of the form of the marginal distributions because of these properties copula is a popular approach to address multivariate problems in climatology and hydrology including rainfall e g de michele and salvadori 2003 kao and

singh and najafi 2020 this study develops a bivariate index based on copulas to characterize meteorological drought caused by the combined effects of precipitation temperature the impacts of climate

index to the lake urmia basin is presented in section 4 followed by a discussion of the results in section 5 and concluding remarks in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 lake urmia basin meteorological drought conditions are analyzed over the lake urmia basin which is a closed basin distinguished by the terminal lake lake urmia it has an area of 52000 km2 which is comprised of high mountain peaks to the west south and east of the lake fig 1 the mean annual precipitation and temperature are 326 mm and 11 5 c respectively for the period of 1985 2005 lake urmia was one of the largest salt lakes on the earth with a surface area of 5200 km2 however since 1995 it has shrunk to less than 20 of its original volume in 2014 unep 2012 aghakouchak et al 2015 previous studies show that both climatic changes and anthropogenic activities have decreased inflows to the lake leading to the current critical situation alizadeh choobari et al 2016 shadkam et al 2016 chaudhari et al 2018 khazaei et al 2019 a recent research suggests that lake urmia shrinkage is triggered mainly by climatic changes and the desiccation process is exacerbated by intense water extraction upstream of the lake as a result the survival of lake urmia is highly dependent on changes in future climate conditions and agricultural water withdrawal schulz et al 2020 lake urmia dry up has already resulted in salt storms from the lake s dry bed soil deterioration biodiversity loss and a wide range of environmental consequences azarnivand et al 2014 the death of the lake will not only be a catastrophe for its environment but will also exert significant negative impacts on the public health food security and economy of the region schmidt et al 2020 the understanding of the covariability of precipitation and temperature as key hydroclimatic variables under climate change can provide crucial information for water resources managers who plan to revive the lake while meeting the needs of local stakeholders 2 2 data monthly precipitation and temperature data from eight quality controlled synoptic stations that are operated by iran meteorological organization table 2 are considered in

1 distributions of precipitation and temperature monthly precipitation and temperature follow the gamma and gaussian distributions respectively wilks 2011 the gamma distribution is very flexible and offers a wide range of shapes for right skewed physically non negative variables such as precipitation the probability density function pdf of the gamma distribution is given by 1 f p 1 β α γ α p α 1 e x p p β p 0 α β 0 where α and β are the shape and scale parameters respectively and γ is the gamma function the cumulative distribution function cdf from which the probability of precipitation can be obtained is 2 f p 1 β α γ α 0 p x α 1 exp x β d x since precipitation may not occur in july september owing to the semi arid climate of the study area delju et al 2012 the mixed cdf of zero and nonzero precipitation values is employed given by 3 g p q 1 q f p where q is the probability of zero estimated by dividing the number of zeros by the total number of precipitation values thom 1951 in regions where precipitation is observed throughout the year or for sufficiently long time scales on which accumulated precipitation is always positive the probability of precipitation is directly calculated by eq 2 the method of maximum likelihood estimation for censored data is used for estimating the parameters of the gamma distribution wilks 1990 in addition to minimizing the effects of zeros on parameter estimation delignette muller and dutang 2015 this method is sensible from physical point of view wilks 1989 1990 to apply the method the censoring level is taken to be 0 1 mm which is the minimum reported amount of precipitation in the study area the time steps for which zero or trace are recorded are therefore regarded as having received zero to 0 1 mm precipitation with no information about the true value the method is implemented using the fitdistrplus r package delignette muller and dutang 2015 3 1 2 copula in this study a multivariate approach is considered to characterize the effects of precipitation temperature covariability on meteorological droughts copula is a multivariate distribution function that couples the joint probability distribution of correlated variables to the individual marginal distributions nelsen 2006 consider two continuous random variables p and t with cdfs u f p p and v f t t respectively where u and v are uniformly distributed there exists a copula function c such that 4 f p t p t c f p p f t t c u v where f p t p t p r p p t t is the joint distribution of p and t according to eq 4 the joint distribution of p and t can be written in terms of their cdfs with copula describing the dependence structure rüschendorf 2009 assuming continuous marginal distributions the joint pdf f p t p t is 5 f p t p t f p p f t t c u v where f p p and f t t are the pdfs of p and t respectively and c is the density function of c defined as 6 c u v 2 c u v u v in contrast to simple measures of correlation such as pearson coefficient copulas can characterize the dependence structures in the center and the tails of marginal distributions the upper tail dependence between two variables is defined as 7a λ u lim u 1 p r u

dependence if λ u 0 λ l 0 joe 1997 two families of parametric copulas that are commonly used hao and singh 2016 are considered since they can adequately represent the multivariate structures of hydroclimatic variables they include two elliptical gaussian and student s t and eight archimedean clayton frank gumbel joe clayton gumbel bb1 joe gumbel bb6 joe clayton bb7 and joe frank bb8 copulas table 4 clayton frank gumbel and joe copulas have a single parameter while bb1 bb6 bb7 and bb8 copulas include two parameters giving them more flexibility in terms of tail dependence the 90 and 270 degrees rotated versions of archimedean copulas are also considered to allow for modeling negative dependencies which is not possible with non rotated copulas such as gumbel and clayton copulas that can only be applied to positively correlated data the distribution functions of copula c rotated by 90 and 270 degrees respectively are given by 8a c 90 u v v c 1 u v 8b c 270 u v u c u 1 v the ranges of the parameters of 90 and 270 degrees rotated copulas are on a negative scale see table 4 praprom and sriboonchitta 2014 the method of inference functions for margins ifm joe 1997 which is commonly used in hydroclimatology e g shiau 2006 shiau et al 2006 mirabbasi et al 2011 madadgar and moradkhani 2013 is used to estimate the parameters of copulas the optimal type of copula is selected based on

clayton gumbel and joe and k 2 for two parameter copulas student s t bb1 bb6 bb7 and bb8 to further evaluate the performance of the selected copula in representing the dependence structure in observations synthetic data are generated from the selected copula the following steps are taken to generate a pair of precipitation temperature p t from a copula c genest and favre 2007 1 generate a value for u f p p from the uniform distribution on the interval 0 1 2 given u u generate a value for v f t t using v q u 1 u where u is another generated value from the uniform distribution on the

p f p 1 u and t f t 1 v plotting the simulated data versus original data provides a graphical goodness of fit test which can be used to evaluate the reliability of the copula model copula calculations are done using the copula yan 2007 kojadinovic and yan 2010 hofert et al 2020 and vinecopula nagler et al 2019 r packages 3 1 3 precipitation temperature deciles index ptdi a bivariate meteorological drought index named precipitation temperature deciles index ptdi is proposed as an extension of the traditional deciles index based on the ptdi meteorological drought is defined as a period when precipitation is less than its long term average and temperature is greater than its long term average to quantify this definition the probability p r p p t t is split into ten parts which is given by 10 pr p p t t pr p p pr p p t t f p p c f p p f t t drought conditions can be determined using the ptdi through the following steps 1 select a reference period i e a timespan relative to which drought conditions are assessed and a suitable time scale e g monthly seasonal annual on which drought conditions are to be determined 2 fit suitable distribution functions to precipitation and temperature data separately 3 fit a suitable bivariate copula to precipitation temperature data 4 calculate p r p p t t for any observed or predicted pairs of precipitation temperature values using eq 10 5 determine the decile range corresponding to the calculated probability for example a probability of 0 35 falls into the 4th decile range 6 report drought condition based on table 1 according to the ptdi eq 10 if a pair of precipitation temperature values belongs to the first decile range then either precipitation is very low or temperature is very high or both hence the first decile range is called extremely dry hot and subsequently the tenth range is extremely wet cold table 1 the proposed index possesses the following characteristics 1 the ptdi is associated with a specific time scale as a result the duration over which precipitation accumulates and temperature conditions prevail e g 1 3 6 9 and 12 months can be explicitly selected based on the purpose of drought analysis 2 the ptdi can be used for a specific time window depending on the aim of analysis e g a specific month or season or the growing season of a crop owing to this property the index can successfully allow for separating seasonality from drought for example the ptdi can be applied to spring data excluding other seasons so that drought conditions in any spring can be determined relative to springs alone 3 the results of the ptdi for a specific time scale are spatially comparable irrespective of climate zones the ptdi is solely determined by precipitation and temperature and not affected by land surface characteristics moreover the index finds the joint probability distribution of precipitation temperature for any region and splits the joint probability space into ten parts in this regard the ptdi can detect below average precipitation above average temperature conditions independent of the climate being arid or humid 3 2 downscaling of precipitation and temperature statistical downscaling involves developing a link between local scale precipitation and temperature predictands and large scale climate variables predictors so that the link can be used to project precipitation and temperature from the outputs of gcms under climate scenarios in the first step of downscaling an atmospheric domain is defined and the most influential predictors are selected the domain is a region in the atmosphere from which predictors are extracted the location and dimension of the atmospheric domain along with the set of influential predictors are determined using the spearman correlation coefficient calculated between ground based precipitation and temperature in the historical period and large scale predictors of the reanalysis dataset within different domains above the study area wilby et al 2004 najafi et al 2011 sachindra et al 2012 mehrotra et al 2013 okkan and kirdemir 2016 twenty one large scale climate variables are considered as potential predictors table 5 these variables represent the atmospheric circulation thickness and moisture content and have been used in previous downscaling studies e g sailor and xiangshang 1999 harpham and wilby 2005 frost et al 2011 beecham et al 2014 abbasian et al 2020 since the influence of the set of predictors on predictands varies from season to season anandhi et al 2009 mehrotra and sharma 2010 jeong et al 2012 correlation analysis is carried out at seasonal time scale in the second step generalized hierarchical linear model ghlm is used to establish a relationship between observed precipitation and temperature and the selected large scale predictors of the reanalysis dataset in the historical period ghlm can partition the total variability of precipitation and temperature into within and between site variability allowing for developing a multi site downscaling model an advantage of ghlm is that the predictand can follow the exponential family of distributions based on this precipitation is downscaled using a two step procedure in june september dry months in the first step precipitation occurrence is predicted at any time step by a logistic hierarchical linear model which is a special type of ghlm in the second step if it is predicted that precipitation occurs the amount of precipitation is estimated through a ghlm whose predictand follows the gamma distribution in other months of the year october may precipitation amount is directly downscaled temperature is downscaled by a well known type of ghlm that models gaussian predictands i e hierarchical linear model hlm the detailed description of multi site downscaling using ghlm is presented by abbasian et al 2020 the textbooks by snijders and bosker 1999 raudenbush and bryk 2002 gelman and hill 2007 also provide theoretical information about ghlm the lme4 r package bates et al 2015 is used to estimate the parameters of ghlms in the third step downscaling models are applied to the outputs of gcms in the historical period and the future periods under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 previous studies suggest that gcms with comparatively greater biases are likely to show larger changes in the future e g boberg and christensen 2012 christensen and boberg 2012 as a result to separate climate change signals from the biases in gcms the projections of each gcm in the future are compared with the simulations of that gcm in the historical period rather than observed data in this regard the results are presented in terms of climate change related changes in the future relative to the past fealy and sweeney 2007 mehrotra and sharma 2010 mehrotra et al 2013 rashid et al 2015 okkan and kirdemir 2016 it is widely recognized that the multi model ensemble mean of gcms has the potential to provide more reliable projections compared to individual gcms e g weigel et al 2008 knutti et al 2010 najafi and moradkhani 2016 wang et al 2018 duan et al 2019 in general multi model ensemble averaging methods are classified into two groups 1 simple arithmetic mean which assigns equal weights to all gcms regardless of their performance and 2 weighted averaging methods which apply different weights to gcms based on their relative performance in representing observed climate some studies show that the latter can yield superior results in comparison with the former e g casanova and ahrens 2009 coppola et al 2010 feng et al 2010 oh and suh 2016 however some other studies suggest that arithmetic mean is easier to implement and can better represent observed climate if ensemble members are produced independently e g lambert and boer 2001 peng et al 2002 moreover the equal weighting approach deserves attention due to the fact that modeling climate system involves significant uncertainties and there is no guarantee that better performing models over a limited historical period will also perform better in the future this can become more important considering that observations have already been used to calibrate gcms hence arithmetic mean can be considered as a more reliable method to combine ensemble members weigel et al 2010 in the present study the selected gcms table 3 are developed by distinct modeling groups and exhibit different skills in simulating precipitation and temperature abbasian et al 2018 therefore the results are presented for individual gcms along with the equally weighted multi model ensemble mean 4 results 4 1 predictor selection correlation analysis using spearman correlation coefficient ρ shows that four 2 5 2 5 large scale grid cells over the lake urmia basin constitute the optimal atmospheric domain for downscaling precipitation and temperature fig 1 the set of the most influential predictors are selected using ρ calculated between large scale reanalysis predictors spatially averaged over the atmospheric domain and station observations the correlation analysis and the modeling of precipitation occurrence in dry months june september are performed on a binary sequence of 0s and 1s where 0 and 1 represent the absence and presence of precipitation at each time step respectively table 6 presents the first three predictors with the largest correlations for precipitation occurrence and amount models and temperature showing statistically significant correlations at 95 confidence level 4 2 calibration and validation of downscaling models large scale climate predictors participate in ghlm s data level model to explain within station variability of precipitation or temperature the latitude longitude and elevation of stations are used in ghlm s station level to account for their between station variability various ghlm structures with different levels of complexity are analyzed for each variable precipitation occurrence and amount and temperature in each month and aic is used to select the parsimonious structure the formulations of ghlms and their corresponding aic values for precipitation amounts in january are presented in table 7 as an example the null model m0 has the simplest structure in which both data and station level models include intercept terms with no predictors the variation of the intercept of the data level model α among stations is characterized by the station level model the m4 model structure with p rate and rhum 700hpa in the data level model and latitude in the station level model has the lowest aic value and therefore is selected as the optimal ghlm structure for the downscaling of precipitation in january the optimal ghlm structures obtained for each month are applied to reanalysis predictors in the calibration period 1985 2005 the scatter plots of downscaled versus observed precipitation and temperature are shown in fig 2 the performance of downscaling is quantified using the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient c nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 calculated between downscaled and observed precipitation and temperature the c nse is 0 68 and 0 98 for precipitation and temperature respectively the statistical properties of observed and downscaled monthly precipitation and temperature considering all stations are presented in table 8 to illustrate precipitation temperature dependence structure for observed and downscaled data the scatter plots of monthly precipitation versus monthly temperature are illustrated in fig 3 the value of ρ between precipitation and temperature is 0 61 and 0 62 for observed and downscaled data respectively leave one station out cross validation is used to evaluate the performance of the multi site downscaling method in simulating precipitation and temperature at new stations not included in calibration abbasian et al 2020 fig 2 shows the scatter plots of downscaled versus observed precipitation and temperature in cross validation the statistical properties of downscaled data in validation are presented in table 8 the c nse of validation dataset is 0 52 and 0 95 for precipitation and temperature respectively 4 3 downscaling of precipitation and temperature from the outputs of gcms to examine climate change related changes in the future with respect to the historical period the calibrated downscaling models are used for the downscaling of monthly precipitation and temperature from the outputs of gcms table 3 in the historical and future periods under rcp4 5 and 8 5 emission scenarios the c nse for downscaled precipitation is 0 42 according to the multi model ensemble mean and varies from 0 20 canesm2 to 0 29 noresm m among gcms for temperature the c nse is 0 96 based on the multi model ensemble mean ranging from 0 93 noresm m to 0 95 hadgem2 cc the ρ between downscaled precipitation and temperature from the outputs of gcms varies between 0 64 miroc5 and 0 61 noresm m and is 0 62 in the multi model ensemble mean data 4 4 changes in precipitation and temperature under climate change fig 4 shows the changes in annual precipitation and temperature means in the future periods under climate scenarios designated rcp4 5 2020 2040 rcp4 5 2040 2060 rcp4 5 2060 2080 rcp8 5 2020 2040 rcp8 5 2040 2060 and rcp8 5 2060 2080 relative to the historical period 1985 2005 based on individual gcms and their multi model ensemble means all results hereafter are presented for the areal average of all stations over the lake urmia basin the projected precipitation change in rcp4 5 2020 2040 is 8 mm based on the multi model ensemble mean with the range of 8 24 mm considering all gcms in addition the projected precipitation change in rcp8 5 2020 2040 is 10 mm 16 47 mm temperature is projected to rise by 1 c 0 3 1 8 c in rcp4 5 2020 2040 and 1 3 c 0 6 2 3 c in rcp8 5 2020 2040 results show that a long term decreasing trend in annual precipitation over future periods can lead to 20 mm 63 15 mm and 25 mm 80 47 mm change in rcp4 5 2060 2080 and rcp8 5 2060 2080 respectively projections show that annual temperature will increase by 2 5 c 1 2 3 4 c and 4 0 c 2 3 5 4 c based on rcp4 5 2060 2080 and rcp8 5 2060 2080 respectively during winter months december to february snow accumulates and forms snowpack which is an important source of water supply for environmental and irrigation demands in spring and summer in the study area since snow to rain ratio and snow cover are related to negative temperatures bednorz 2004 the number of freezing months in the historical and future periods each of which containing 252 21 12 months in total is presented in table 9 june to august summer are the hottest months of the year in the lake urmia basin during the past decades the residents of the basin did not need to use cooling facilities because of moderate temperatures in summers recently however there has been a tendency to install and use air conditioners as the air temperature is rising temperatures over 26 c are likely to cause restlessness and persuade people to utilize air conditioners on this basis the number of months with temperatures over 26 c in the historical and future periods is presented in table 10 4 5 climatic water balance to investigate the combined effects of precipitation change and temperature rise on climate induced water deficit in the unit mm the climatic water balance is calculated which is the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration at a given location over a certain period of time the balance indicates whether atmospheric evaporative demand is met by received water from the atmosphere hence the positive and negative values of the climatic water balance represent climatic surplus or deficit in the water budget respectively the annual time series of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and climatic water balance based on the multi model ensemble means of gcms in the historical and future periods under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are illustrated in fig 5 potential evapotranspiration is calculated by the method of thornthwaite since monthly temperature is the only variable required in this method the monthly values of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are aggregated over january december to calculate annual time series the average values of annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration and climatic water balance are presented in table 11 4 6 bivariate analysis of meteorological drought using the ptdi meteorological drought is characterized using the ptdi which is proposed in the present study the analysis is performed based on monthly precipitation and temperature i e the time scale of the ptdi is one month to model precipitation temperature dependence structure parametric copulas described in table 4 with gamma for precipitation and gaussian for temperature marginal distributions are fitted to the monthly downscaled data in the historical period for each gcm the estimated parameters and the values of aic corresponding to canesm2 as an example are given in table 12 the bb8 copula 90 rotated consistently shows the best performance for all gcms ten thousand data points are simulated from the joint distributions to graphically examine the goodness of fit of the copula models fig 6 shows the contour plots of the density of copula models and the scatter plot of downscaled and simulated precipitation temperature data for all gcms the ptdi is calculated for monthly precipitation temperature data in the historical and future periods in the lake urmia basin the percentage of data points in each category of the ptdi table 1 is shown in fig 7 in the historical period about 45 of monthly records fall in the first extremely dry hot and second dry hot categories based on the individual gcms about 42 of data points are in the third category normal which consists of four decile ranges approximately 13 of the remaining data points are classified in the fourth wet cold and fifth extremely wet cold categories as the density of data records in the lower right region of the precipitation temperature scatter plot is low figs 3 and 6 the projected changes in the number of extremely dry hot and dry hot months are 3 1 5 3 6 in rcp4 5 2020 2040 and 3 1 0 5 2 in rcp8 5 2020 2040 the largest projected growth in the frequency of the first two categories of the ptdi is associated with rcp8 5 2060 2080 in which the multi model ensemble mean shows 11 5 increase with the range of 4 8 24 0 based on all gcms wheat is one of the major crops in the northwest of iran including the lake urmia basin because of the above average precipitation in this region nouri et al 2016 wheat production in the lake urmia basin is highly affected by precipitation and temperature conditions in april may and june nassiri et al 2006 nouri et al 2017 temperature increase would reduce the length of the growing period while precipitation decrease would cause water deficiencies both of which can lead to reduction in wheat yield nassiri et al 2006 therefore the methodology of the ptdi is also applied to the period of april june i e the time scale of the ptdi is 3 months and the time window is april june the scatter plots of downscaled data in april june and the contours of the joint precipitation temperature density functions are illustrated in fig 8 the percentages of data points that lie within each five categories of the ptdi are calculated for historical and future periods fig 9 4 7 analysis of meteorological drought using the spei and spi the proposed drought index in this study the ptdi provides a conceptually different approach from other indices to characterize meteorological drought however a further analysis of the effects of climate change on meteorological drought in the lake urmia basin is carried out based on the spei and spi as these are two widely used indices the monthly time series of the 12 month spei and spi in the historical and future periods under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are calculated for all gcms and the multi model ensemble means and presented in the supplementary material figs s1 s4 5 discussion this study presents a novel approach to assess projected changes in meteorological drought events under climate change based on the joint variability of precipitation temperature using a proposed drought index the ptdi section 3 the quantitative results of the application of the methodology to the lake urmia basin are presented in section 4 correlation analysis to identify the set of optimal large scale predictors for the downscaling of local precipitation and temperature section 4 1 shows that the most influential predictors include precipitation rate relative humidity air temperature and geopotential height table 6 this result is physically reasonable precipitation rate is the simulated precipitation by gcms and the reanalysis dataset and therefore directly connected with local precipitation widmann et al 2003 schmidli et al 2007 relative humidity presents the atmospheric water vapor content associated with the formation of clouds peixoto and oort 1996 geopotential height approximates the height of large scale atmospheric pressure above mean sea level it is an indicator of a relatively low pressure region i e pressure trough which is connected with the formation of clouds and precipitation sachindra et al 2014 regarding temperature geopotential height difference between two pressure levels e g 500 and 750 hpa is related to the average temperature between the levels milrad 2018 finally large scale air temperature is the upper level or surface temperature simulated by gcms and therefore linked to regional temperature the evaluation of the downscaling models which transform the selected large scale predictors to ground based precipitation and temperature shows that the performance of the models in calibration is satisfactory based on the c nse ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 the higher performance of downscaling for temperature is reflected in fig 2 as temperature data points are more closely scattered around the 1 1 line compared to precipitation this is partly due to the fact that precipitation generation mechanism is highly complex and cannot be fully characterized by large scale predictors schoof and pryor 2001 in addition previous studies show that lakes can affect local precipitation patterns e g wilson 1977 nicholls and toumi 2013 dai et al 2018 the performance of downscaling in terms of precipitation temperature dependence is satisfactory since the value of ρ in downscaled data is almost equal to that of observed data and the dependence structure of monthly precipitation temperature over the basin is well preserved in the downscaled data fig 3 the c nse the scatter plots fig 2 and the statistical properties table 8 of downscaled data in leave one station out cross validation show that the downscaling models can incorporate data from neighboring sites to downscale precipitation and temperature at new stations reasonably well for a further discussion on the performance of ghlm in multi site downscaling see abbasian et al 2020 the results of the downscaling of precipitation and temperature from the outputs of gcms in the historical period section 4 3 show that gcms can represent the observed climate in the lake urmia basin the comparatively higher overall performance of downscaling for the reanalysis dataset is due to the fact that in contrast to gcms the reanalysis dataset is quality controlled and corrected against observations and therefore treated as the simulations of an ideal gcm christensen et al 2001 besides gcms are not expected to reproduce observations at monthly or annual scales but to preserve the long term trend and variability of climate kharin et al 2007 loukas et al 2008 the multi model ensemble mean outperforms individual gcms based on the c nse shifts in the mean of precipitation and temperature in the future due to climate change are very important to local authorities since they are currently attempting to halt the desiccation of lake urmia and revitalize the lake gradually hence any decline in precipitation or increase in temperature can further complicate the restoration of the lake projected changes in precipitation and temperature under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios are presented in section 4 4 results for the period of 2020 2040 indicate that the majority of gcms project a small increase or decline in the mean of precipitation fig 4 the multi model ensemble mean shows an approximately 10 mm change in annual precipitation which is not statistically significant based on thet test at 95 significance level hence it can be inferred that precipitation will not change significantly over the next two decades results for temperature change on the other hand show that all gcms consistently project temperature rise in 2020 2040 fig 4 such that the multi model ensemble mean displays 1 and 1 3 c increase in annual temperature under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively which are statistically significant these findings imply that the consequences of temperature increase can be the main concern for restoring the lake urmia in the near future tracking the projections over 2020 2040 and 2060 2080 indicates that most of the gcms anticipate a long term decreasing trend in precipitation such that the multi model ensemble shows a statistically significant decline in 2060 2080 under rcp4 5 20 mm and rcp8 5 25 mm precipitation decline over time is accompanied by dramatic temperature rise leading to 2 5 and 4 0 c increase in rcp4 5 2060 2080 and rcp8 5 2060 2080 respectively based on the multi model ensemble mean most gcms project decreases in the number of months with negative temperatures in rcp4 5 2020 2040 and rcp8 5 2020 2040 by about 50 relative to the historical period table 9 this remarkable warming in the near future can adversely affect snowpack resources and consequently reduce streamflow in warm seasons further while summer temperatures have been below 26 c in the historical period most of the gcms project that temperature will exceed 26 c in the following decades under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios table 10 assuming that people use air conditioners 10 h a day on average during the months with temperatures over 26 c a typical household power consumption for air conditioning alone would be 600 kwh each month this can introduce new challenges to the energy sector of the region changes in climate related water deficit due to the combined effects of precipitation change and temperature increase under climate change are analyzed using the climatic water balance section 4 5 according to the aridity index the climate of a given location is classified as semi arid if the ratio of average annual precipitation to average annual potential evapotranspiration is between 0 20 and 0 50 unep 1992 the value of the index is 0 49 in the historical period table 11 and therefore the climate of the lake urmia basin is placed at the upper limit of the semi arid class however projections suggest that the value of the index will decrease over the future periods even in 2020 2040 in which a slight precipitation increase is anticipated by the multi model ensemble mean this implies that the climate of the lake urmia basin is projected to shift toward drier conditions in the future a visual inspection of annual time series fig 5 reveals an evident increasing trend in the magnitude of climate induced water deficit under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 mainly due to a monotonic increase in potential evapotranspiration followed by a long term decrease in precipitation the magnitude of water deficit can grow by 52 and 77 in 2060 2080 relative to the historical period under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively this can pose new challenges to agricultural production in the lake urmia basin including rainfed wheat which is one of the major crops in the region moreover considering that agriculture is the main source of income schmidt et al 2020 an increase in water deficit can further stimulate water withdrawal and diversion upstream of lake urmia to maintain agricultural production and therefore reduce inflows to the lake to a greater extent the impact of climate change on meteorological drought is assessed using the ptdi section 4 6 the methodology of the ptdi is applied to monthly precipitation temperature data graphical goodness of fit shows that the bb8 copula with the gamma and gaussian marginal distributions can adequately represent the dependence structure of precipitation temperature in the historical period fig 6 the results of the ptdi calculation using copula models shows that about 45 of precipitation temperature data points belong to extremely dry hot and dry hot categories of the ptdi in the historical period this shows that the ptdi reflects the nature of the semi arid climate of the lake urmia basin through the joint behavior of precipitation temperature when all months are analyzed together without isolating the seasonality all gcms project increases in the number of extremely dry hot and dry hot months in the next two decades under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this finding is consistent with the results obtained from the climatic water balance the frequency of precipitation temperature data points in the first two categories of the ptdi is expected to grow over the future periods leading to 11 5 increase in rcp8 5 2060 2080 based on the multi model ensemble mean the projected change is consistent among all gcms such that even canesm2 which projects 47 8 mm increase in precipitation in rcp8 5 2060 2080 shows a similar trend of change because of a large increase in the projected temperature i e 4 7 c it is worth noting that taking all gcms into account the range of projected increase in the number of extremely dry hot and dry hot months is 1 0 5 2 and 4 8 24 0 in rcp8 5 2020 2040 and rcp8 5 2060 2080 respectively this implies that the uncertainties associated with climate modeling become larger over time the ptdi is also calculated for the period of april june as wheat production efficiency is highly affected by precipitation and temperature conditions at this time of the year the analysis involves only april june excluding the rest of the year so that seasonality can be eliminated monthly precipitation is aggregated and monthly temperature is averaged over the period of april june i e the time scale of the index is 3 months results show that the period of april june is projected to become drier hotter in 2060 2080 based on all gcms under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios implying that rainfed agricultural products mainly wheat can be adversely affected in the future this result is graphically illustrated in fig 10 which shows that precipitation temperature data points in rcp8 5 2060 2080 are projected to shift toward the upper left corner of the scatter plot compared to the historical period explaining why the ptdi shows that the period of april june is expected to become drier hotter a visual inspection of the time series of the spei supplementary material figs s1 and s2 reveals that the duration and severity of meteorological drought are projected to grow over future periods relative to the historical period based on all gcms and the multi model ensembles means under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this long term increasing trend in drought characteristics is consistent with the results obtained from the ptdi as the spei takes the effects of temperature into account through potential evapotranspiration the time series of the spi supplementary material figs s3 and s4 however show that the duration and the severity of drought are projected to decrease based on the gcms which anticipate precipitation increase for example the simulations of the canesm2 under rcp8 5 suggest that the historical period would generally be a dry spell compared to the future periods supplementary material fig s4a because of the significant projected increase in precipitation in the future therefore the results of the spi are not consistent with the outcomes of the ptdi and spei as the spi does not represent the effects of temperature rise on meteorological drought 6 conclusion in this study meteorological drought is defined and characterized based on the joint variability of precipitation temperature the impacts of climate change on meteorological drought is then assessed using the proposed approach generalized hierarchical linear model ghlm which pools data from multiple stations while explaining station to station variability is used for the downscaling of monthly precipitation and temperature at multiple sites in the lake urmia basin for the historical 1985 2005 and future 2020 2040 2040 2060 and 2060 2080 periods under rcp4 5 and 8 5 emission scenarios the predictand of ghlm can follow a member of the exponential family of distributions owing to this property precipitation in dry months is downscaled through a two step approach in which the occurrence is modeled by a logistic hierarchical linear model to identify the time steps when precipitation occurs followed by estimating the amount of precipitation at those time steps using ghlm with a gamma distributed predictand ghlms are calibrated and validated using the ncep doe reanalysis dataset and the best ghlm structure is selected for each month and each predictand based on aic the outputs of nine cmip5 gcms are downscaled using the calibrated models in the historical and future periods the dependence structure of the downscaled precipitation temperature data is characterized using copulas for the individual gcms and the multi model ensemble mean the traditional deciles index is extended to a bivariate index called precipitation temperature deciles index ptdi to evaluate changes in future precipitation temperature conditions relative to the historical period based on all gcms simulations temperature is projected to increase in the lake urmia basin over all future periods under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios projections show that the frequency of freezing months will decline to almost half of its historical value and summer temperature will exceed 26 c in the next decades temperature is projected to increase by 2 5 c and 4 0 c in rcp4 5 2060 2080 and rcp8 5 2060 2080 respectively based on the multi model ensemble mean due to high uncertainties in simulating precipitation there is less agreement among gcms on even the direction of precipitation changes in the future periods however the multi model ensemble means show significant changes in rcp4 5 2060 2080 and rcp8 5 2060 2080 in which annual precipitation is projected to decrease by 20 and 25 mm respectively the near future is crucial to the restoration of lake urmia water resources development projects such as constructing new dams are already halted and local authorities have initiated a plan to reduce irrigation water use by 40 in the basin therefore climate change related decline in available water can introduce new challenges to the current mitigation measures characterizing meteorological drought using the ptdi in 2020 2040 indicates that although the multi model ensemble mean of gcms shows a slight increase in precipitation under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 all gcms project an increase in the number of extremely dry hot and dry hot months relative to the historical period this is mostly associated with large increases in projected temperature this result is also inferred from the climatic water balance which shows that climate induced water deficit is projected to intensify despite an approximately 10 mm increase in annual precipitation during 2020 2040 moreover all gcms including those anticipating significant precipitation increase project that the frequency of drought months will grow over 2040 2060 and 2060 2080 projected increase in extremely dry hot and dry hot months by all gcms under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 can adversely affect rainfed agriculture this can heighten the irrigation consumptive use of crops as well which is particularly important because agricultural activities are already blamed for the lake s water level decline one option to mitigate climate induced water deficiency is to update agricultural practices to use available water efficiently as current irrigation efficiency is as low as 30 modifying crop patterns planting dates and crop rotation i e planting alternative crops in consecutive seasons can also increase water productivity developing alternative sources of income such as reviving the tourism of the region and supporting industrial activities can lead to reduced water consumption in the basin and therefore provide a means for adapting to new climatic conditions overall results indicate that climate change can exacerbate existing environmental and socio economic issues in the lake urmia basin unless appropriate mitigation plans are devised and implemented funding sources this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the

5027,meteorological droughts due to the concurrent occurrence of low precipitation and high temperature events can lead to severe negative impacts on agriculture economy ecosystem and society this study proposes a novel framework to characterize such drought conditions based on the joint variability of precipitation temperature particularly under climate change generalized hierarchical linear model is used to downscale precipitation and temperature at multiple stations from the outputs of nine general circulation models gcms under representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 a bivariate drought index called precipitation temperature deciles index ptdi is developed using copulas to assess changes in future dry hot conditions the methodology is applied to the lake urmia basin located in a semi arid region in the northwest of iran lake urmia the sixth largest salt lake in the world at the original size has shrunk dramatically causing environmental and socioeconomic disruptions results suggest that the climate of the region is projected to shift toward drier hotter conditions in the future the multi model ensemble means of all gcms shows an increase of 4 c in the regional temperature and 25 mm 8 decrease in precipitation in 2060 2080 based on rcp8 5 the magnitude of climate induced water deficit is projected to increase under all future scenarios according to the ptdi projected changes in the number of extremely dry hot months in 2060 2080 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 relative to the historical period vary between 2 4 and 7 3 and 4 5 13 2 respectively this condition is unfavorable for the revival of the endangered lake while maintaining the agricultural activities in the region keywords climate change impact precipitation temperature bivariate drought index copula lake urmia 1 introduction drought is a natural hazard with significant negative impacts on agriculture economy ecosystem and society prolonged severe droughts can eventually lead to disasters such as famine death and mass immigration particularly in developing countries wilhite 2005 godfray et al 2010 drought characterization plays a pivotal role in planning and decision making for drought preparedness mitigation and response thereby minimizing food financial and socio economic crisis following the theory of runs proposed by yevjevich 1967 drought indices have become the most widely used quantitative measures of drought that take one or several variables into account such as precipitation and evapotranspiration to characterize drought zargar et al 2011 since drought is an intrinsically complicated phenomenon it does not have a single universal definition heim 2002 therefore drought definition and quantification through indices is a context dependent matter droughts are categorized into four types from the operational point of view meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic wilhite and glantz 1985 meteorological drought which is the focus of this research stems from water deficiency driven by atmospheric conditions such as precipitation decline and temperature rise over a specific region and period of time dracup et al 1980 in other words meteorological drought is governed by dry weather patterns which cannot be managed or controlled besides it can instigate soil moisture deficit i e agricultural drought water resources shortage i e hydrological drought and eventually imbalance between water supply and demand i e socio economic drought on this ground much effort has been devoted to developing meteorological drought indices heim 2002 keyantash and dracup 2002 zargar et al 2011 the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 is a popular drought index which is widely used worldwide hayes et al 2011 the spi is solely based on precipitation making the index very easy to calculate and implement the primary motivation behind the spi was to demonstrate that drought duration severity and frequency are dependent upon the time scale over which precipitation deficit accumulates a fact which had been highlighted by previous studies e g dracup et al 1980 hence the explicit time scale of the spi can allow for taking the lagged effects of precipitation deficiency into account a limitation of the spi that seems to be overlooked in previous studies however is that the index cannot properly separate seasonality from drought a viable index should be able to detect drought regardless of whether it is summer or winter narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 this is especially important in semi arid and arid regions where precipitation is not distributed uniformly over the year and summers are normally much drier than winters the deciles index gibbs and maher 1967 is another precipitation based meteorological drought index which can be applied to any desired period and time scale zargar et al 2011 the index divides the distribution of precipitation into ten parts i e deciles the first decile range represents the set of precipitation values that are not exceeded by the lowest 10 of the observed precipitation values according to the australian bureau of meteorology which classifies the decile ranges into five groups table 1 an area experiences precipitation deficiency if precipitation falls in the first decile range for at least three months of the year nagarajan 2010 drought indices founded solely on precipitation including the spi and deciles index are limited by at least two main assumptions 1 meteorological drought is governed by precipitation variability only and the effects of other variables such as temperature are negligible and 2 the probability distributions of the other variables are stationary however it is now widely recognized that drought characteristics are associated with both precipitation and temperature patterns e g williams et al 2012 griffin and anchukaitis 2014 hlaváčová et al 2018 yang et al 2020 in particular the effects of temperature on droughts can be more pronounced under global warming and climate change according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc s fifth assessment report the means and high extremes of temperature are projected to increase over most land areas around the world and precipitation deficit may increase over many regions in the future ipcc 2018 the combined impacts of extreme precipitation temperature events can result in severe consequences a low precipitation period along with above average temperature can exacerbate water shortages and drought conditions for example aghakouchak et al 2014 showed that drought analysis based solely on precipitation ignoring the role of temperature would substantially underestimate the 2014 california drought event the individual return period estimates of precipitation and temperature were 24 and 120 years respectively while the joint precipitation temperature return period was 200 years to consider the role of temperature in drought characterization meteorological indices combine or compare the amount of water received from the atmosphere through precipitation with the maximum amount of water transferred to the atmosphere by potential evapotranspiration tsakiris and vangelis 2005 used the notion of the aridity index to develop the reconnaissance drought index rdi which is based on the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration e p vicente serrano et al 2010 extended the spi to the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei by applying a modified methodology of the spi to the difference between precipitation and e p rather than precipitation alone in this regard the spei implements climatic water balance to determine water deficiency resulted from atmospheric processes some researchers have suggested that e p can be the most influential variable in the onset and persistence of drought from this perspective the evaporative stress index esi anderson et al 2007a 2007b and the evaporative demand drought index eddi hobbins et al 2016 mcevoy et al 2016 are developed upon e p such that they are independent of precipitation from agricultural viewpoint the difference between actual evapotranspiration e a and e p called evaporative deficit is proposed for analyzing drought since high evaporative deficit can indicate that crop is under water stress vicente serrano et al 2015 2018 the evapotranspiration deficit index etdi narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 and the standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi kim and rhee 2016 are among drought indices involving e a e a is a function of climate crop and soil characteristics and agricultural management practices as a result estimating e a is a complicated task requiring climate data soil moisture information and land surface models on the other hand e p is only a function of climatic conditions allen et al 1998 kim and rhee 2016 hence e p can be considered as a suitable variable for quantifying meteorological drought since it can allow for comparing atmospheric water demand at different regions in different seasons beguería et al 2014 regardless of local agricultural and management factors although estimating e p is considerably simpler than estimating e a it is still not clear to what extent the choice of e p calculation method can influence drought indices for example van der schrier et al 2011 and dai 2011 suggested that the palmer drought severity index pdsi is not highly sensitive to either the thornthwaite or penman monteith equations on the contrary beguería et al 2014 found that the e p equation used for calculating the spei can be important in semi arid and arid regions it is widely recognized that precipitation and temperature have great impacts on the environment energy demand human health industrial and agricultural activities tencer et al 2014 they govern droughts and water shortages through changes in the runoff volume groundwater recharge evapotranspiration soil moisture and snow najafi et al 2017 precipitation and temperature also play a pivotal role in crop production lobell and asner 2003 lobell et al 2007 lobell and field 2007 cooper et al 2008 previous studies imply that the proper understanding of extreme climate related events requires a careful examination of interdependencies between the two variables trenberth and shea 2005 showed that negative correlations between monthly precipitation and temperature dominate mid latitudes as higher temperatures favor dry conditions with more sunshine i e less cloud cover and less evaporative cooling while wet summers are generally cool on the contrary positive correlations dominate high latitudes in winter as warm moist advection in extratropical cyclones favors wet conditions and the moisture capacity of the air increases with rising temperature huang et al 2009 found significant negative correlations at annual scale in china cong and brady 2012 detected negative correlations at monthly scale in sweden tencer et al 2014 found significant positive correlations at daily scale between heavy precipitation events and warm nights or warm days at more than half of the stations over canada singh et al 2019 analyzed spatial variations in interdependencies between temperature and precipitation in canada and discovered positive correlations over higher latitudes sub arctic regions but negative correlations in the prairie provinces the association between precipitation and temperature highlights the importance of considering the joint behavior of the variables besides their individual variations nevertheless a methodology to systematically characterize meteorological drought based on the joint variability of precipitation temperature is not developed yet the investigation of precipitation temperature dependence structure involves the application of multivariate techniques traditional multivariate analysis methods such as multivariate gaussian and gamma distributions assume that the constituting variables follow the same type of distributions copulas are multivariate probability distribution functions pdfs which provide a flexible framework to couple the univariate distributions of correlated random variables copula can model the dependence structure among hydroclimate variables regardless of the form of the marginal distributions because of these properties copula is a popular approach to address multivariate problems in climatology and hydrology including rainfall e g de michele and salvadori 2003 kao and govindaraju 2008 flooding e g shiau et al 2006 zhang and singh 2006 droughts shiau 2006 zhang et al 2012 and bivariate analysis of precipitation temperature e g aghakouchak et al 2014 rana et al 2016 singh and najafi 2020 this study develops a bivariate index based on copulas to characterize meteorological drought caused by the combined effects of precipitation temperature the impacts of climate change on meteorological droughts conditions are then assessed by applying the index to statistically downscaled precipitation and temperature from the outputs of general circulation models gcms under future climate scenarios generalized hierarchical linear model ghlm abbasian et al 2020 is used for multi site downscaling of precipitation and temperature ghlm is an extension of generalized linear model glm which can explicitly explain the variability of precipitation and temperature in space and time in the remainder of this paper the study area and data are described in section 2 the methodology including the proposed bivariate meteorological drought index and the downscaling of precipitation and temperature is explained in section 3 the results of the application of the proposed index to the lake urmia basin is presented in section 4 followed by a discussion of the results in section 5 and concluding remarks in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 lake urmia basin meteorological drought conditions are analyzed over the lake urmia basin which is a closed basin distinguished by the terminal lake lake urmia it has an area of 52000 km2 which is comprised of high mountain peaks to the west south and east of the lake fig 1 the mean annual precipitation and temperature are 326 mm and 11 5 c respectively for the period of 1985 2005 lake urmia was one of the largest salt lakes on the earth with a surface area of 5200 km2 however since 1995 it has shrunk to less than 20 of its original volume in 2014 unep 2012 aghakouchak et al 2015 previous studies show that both climatic changes and anthropogenic activities have decreased inflows to the lake leading to the current critical situation alizadeh choobari et al 2016 shadkam et al 2016 chaudhari et al 2018 khazaei et al 2019 a recent research suggests that lake urmia shrinkage is triggered mainly by climatic changes and the desiccation process is exacerbated by intense water extraction upstream of the lake as a result the survival of lake urmia is highly dependent on changes in future climate conditions and agricultural water withdrawal schulz et al 2020 lake urmia dry up has already resulted in salt storms from the lake s dry bed soil deterioration biodiversity loss and a wide range of environmental consequences azarnivand et al 2014 the death of the lake will not only be a catastrophe for its environment but will also exert significant negative impacts on the public health food security and economy of the region schmidt et al 2020 the understanding of the covariability of precipitation and temperature as key hydroclimatic variables under climate change can provide crucial information for water resources managers who plan to revive the lake while meeting the needs of local stakeholders 2 2 data monthly precipitation and temperature data from eight quality controlled synoptic stations that are operated by iran meteorological organization table 2 are considered in this study www irimo ir the selected historical period of 1985 2005 is the common period for all stations with less than 3 missing data it should be noted that 2005 is the last year of the historical

precipitation and temperature over iran abbasian et al 2018 and are expected to characterize the range of possible future projections 3 methods 3 1 bivariate analysis of precipitation temperature 3 1 1 distributions of precipitation and temperature monthly precipitation and temperature follow the gamma and gaussian distributions respectively wilks 2011 the gamma distribution is very flexible and offers a wide range of shapes for right skewed physically non negative variables such as precipitation the probability density function pdf of the gamma distribution is given by 1 f p 1 β α γ α p α 1 e x p p β p 0 α β 0 where α and β are the shape and scale parameters respectively and γ is the gamma function the cumulative distribution function cdf from which the probability of precipitation can be obtained is 2 f p 1 β α γ α 0 p x α 1 exp x β d x since precipitation may not occur in july september owing to the semi arid climate of the study area delju et al 2012 the mixed cdf of zero and nonzero precipitation values is employed given by 3 g p q 1 q f p where q is the probability of zero estimated by dividing the number of zeros by the total number of precipitation values thom 1951 in regions where precipitation is observed throughout the year or for sufficiently long time scales on which accumulated precipitation is always positive the probability of precipitation is directly calculated by eq 2 the method of maximum likelihood estimation for censored data is used for estimating the parameters of the gamma distribution wilks 1990 in addition to minimizing the effects of zeros on parameter estimation delignette muller and dutang 2015 this method is sensible from physical point of view wilks 1989 1990 to apply the method the censoring level is taken to be 0 1 mm which is the minimum reported amount of precipitation in the study area the time steps for which zero or trace are recorded are therefore regarded as having received zero to 0 1 mm precipitation with no information about the true value the method is implemented using the fitdistrplus r package delignette muller and dutang 2015 3 1 2 copula in this study a multivariate approach is considered to characterize the effects of precipitation temperature covariability on meteorological droughts copula is a multivariate distribution function that couples the joint probability distribution of correlated variables to the individual marginal distributions nelsen 2006 consider two continuous random variables p and t with cdfs u f p p and v f t t respectively where u and v are uniformly distributed there exists a copula function c such that 4 f p t p t c f p p f t t c u v where f p t p t p r p p t t is the joint distribution of p and t according to eq 4 the joint distribution of p and t can be written in terms of their cdfs with copula describing the dependence structure rüschendorf 2009 assuming continuous marginal distributions the joint pdf f p t p t is 5 f p t p t f p p f t t c u v where f p p and f t t are the pdfs of p and t respectively and c is the density function of c defined as 6 c u v 2 c u v u v in contrast to simple measures of correlation such as pearson coefficient copulas can characterize the dependence structures in the center and the tails of marginal distributions the upper tail dependence between two variables is defined as 7a λ u lim u 1 p r u u v u lim u 1 1 2 u c u u u and the lower tail dependence is defined as 7b λ l lim u 0 p r u u v u lim u 0 c u u u c has upper lower tail dependence if λ u 0 1 λ l 0 1 but no upper lower tail dependence if λ u 0 λ l 0 joe 1997 two families of parametric copulas that are commonly used hao and singh 2016 are considered since they can adequately represent the multivariate structures of hydroclimatic variables they include two elliptical gaussian and student s t and eight archimedean clayton frank gumbel joe clayton gumbel bb1 joe gumbel bb6 joe clayton bb7 and joe frank bb8 copulas table 4 clayton frank gumbel and joe copulas have a single parameter while bb1 bb6 bb7 and bb8 copulas include two parameters giving them more flexibility in terms of tail dependence the 90 and 270 degrees rotated versions of archimedean copulas are also considered to allow for modeling negative dependencies which is not possible with non rotated copulas such as gumbel and clayton copulas that can only be applied to positively correlated data the distribution functions of copula c rotated by 90 and 270 degrees respectively are given by 8a c 90 u v v c 1 u v 8b c 270 u v u c u 1 v the ranges of the parameters of 90 and 270 degrees rotated copulas are on a negative scale see table 4 praprom and sriboonchitta 2014 the method of inference functions for margins ifm joe 1997 which is commonly used in hydroclimatology e g shiau 2006 shiau et al 2006 mirabbasi et al 2011 madadgar and moradkhani 2013 is used to estimate the parameters of copulas the optimal type of copula is selected based on akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 which is defined by 9 aic 2 i 1 n ln c u i v i θ 2 k where θ is the set of the parameters of a copula k 1 for one parameter copulas the gaussian frank clayton gumbel and joe and k 2 for two parameter copulas student s t bb1 bb6 bb7 and bb8 to further evaluate the performance of the selected copula in representing the dependence structure in observations synthetic data are generated from the selected copula the following steps are taken to generate a pair of precipitation temperature p t from a copula c genest and favre 2007 1 generate a value for u f p p from the uniform distribution on the interval 0 1 2 given u u generate a value for v f t t using v q u 1 u where u is another generated value from the uniform distribution on the interval 0 1 and q u v is the conditional distribution of v given u which is determined by q u v p r v v u u u c u v 3 obtain the values of p and t from the inverse marginal distribution functions i e p f p 1 u and t f t 1 v plotting the simulated data versus original data provides a graphical goodness of fit test which can be used to evaluate the reliability of the copula model copula calculations are done using the copula yan 2007 kojadinovic and yan 2010 hofert et al 2020 and vinecopula nagler et al 2019 r packages 3 1 3 precipitation temperature deciles index ptdi a bivariate meteorological drought index named precipitation temperature deciles index ptdi is proposed as an extension of the traditional deciles index based on the ptdi meteorological drought is defined as a period when precipitation is less than its long term average and temperature is greater than its long term average to quantify this definition the probability p r p p t t is split into ten parts which is given by 10 pr p p t t pr p p pr p p t t f p p c f p p f t t drought conditions can be determined using the ptdi through the following steps 1 select a reference period i e a timespan relative to which drought conditions are assessed and a suitable time scale e g monthly seasonal annual on which drought conditions are to be determined 2 fit suitable distribution functions to precipitation and temperature data separately 3 fit a suitable bivariate copula to precipitation temperature data 4 calculate p r p p t t for any observed or predicted pairs of precipitation temperature values using eq 10 5 determine the decile range corresponding to the calculated probability for example a probability of 0 35 falls into the 4th decile range 6 report drought condition based on table 1 according to the ptdi eq 10 if a pair of precipitation temperature values belongs to the first decile range then either precipitation is very low or temperature is very high or both hence the first decile range is called extremely dry hot and subsequently the tenth range is extremely wet cold table 1 the proposed index possesses the following characteristics 1 the ptdi is associated with a specific time scale as a result the duration over which precipitation accumulates and temperature conditions prevail e g 1 3 6 9 and 12 months can be explicitly selected based on the purpose of drought analysis 2 the ptdi can be used for a specific time window depending on the aim of analysis e g a specific month or season or the growing season of a crop owing to this property the index can successfully allow for separating seasonality from drought for example the ptdi can be applied to spring data excluding other seasons so that drought conditions in any spring can be determined relative to springs alone 3 the results of the ptdi for a specific time scale are spatially comparable irrespective of climate zones the ptdi is solely determined by precipitation and temperature and not affected by land surface characteristics moreover the index finds the joint probability distribution of precipitation temperature for any region and splits the joint probability space into ten parts in this regard the ptdi can detect below average precipitation above average temperature conditions independent of the climate being arid or humid 3 2 downscaling of precipitation and temperature statistical downscaling involves developing a link between local scale precipitation and temperature predictands and large scale climate variables predictors so that the link can be used to project precipitation and temperature from the outputs of gcms under climate scenarios in the first step of downscaling an atmospheric domain is defined and the most influential predictors are selected the domain is a region in the atmosphere from which predictors are extracted the location and dimension of the atmospheric domain along with the set of influential predictors are determined using the spearman correlation coefficient calculated between ground based precipitation and temperature in the historical period and large scale predictors of the reanalysis dataset within different domains above the study area wilby et al 2004 najafi et al 2011 sachindra et al 2012 mehrotra et al 2013 okkan and kirdemir 2016 twenty one large scale climate variables are considered as potential predictors table 5 these variables represent the atmospheric circulation thickness and moisture content and have been used in previous downscaling studies e g sailor and xiangshang 1999 harpham and wilby 2005 frost et al 2011 beecham et al 2014 abbasian et al 2020 since the influence of the set of predictors on predictands varies from season to season anandhi et al 2009 mehrotra and sharma 2010 jeong et al 2012 correlation analysis is carried out at seasonal time scale in the second step generalized hierarchical linear model ghlm is used to establish a relationship between observed precipitation and temperature and the selected large scale predictors of the reanalysis dataset in the historical period ghlm can partition the total variability of precipitation and temperature into within and between site variability allowing for developing a multi site downscaling model an advantage of ghlm is that the predictand can follow the exponential family of distributions based on this precipitation is downscaled using a two step procedure in june september dry months in the first step precipitation occurrence is predicted at any time step by a logistic hierarchical linear model which is a special type of ghlm in the second step if it is predicted that precipitation occurs the amount of precipitation is estimated through a ghlm whose predictand follows the gamma distribution in other months of the year october may precipitation amount is directly downscaled temperature is downscaled by a well known type of ghlm that models gaussian predictands i e hierarchical linear model hlm the detailed description of multi site downscaling using ghlm is presented by abbasian et al 2020 the textbooks by snijders and bosker 1999 raudenbush and bryk 2002 gelman and hill 2007 also provide theoretical information about ghlm the lme4 r package bates et al 2015 is used to estimate the parameters of ghlms in the third step downscaling models are applied to the outputs of gcms in the historical period and the future periods under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 previous studies suggest that gcms with comparatively greater biases are likely to show larger changes in the future e g boberg and christensen 2012 christensen and boberg 2012 as a result to separate climate change signals from the biases in gcms the projections of each gcm in the future are compared with the simulations of that gcm in the historical period rather than observed data in this regard the results are presented in terms of climate change related changes in the future relative to the past fealy and sweeney 2007 mehrotra and sharma 2010 mehrotra et al 2013 rashid et al 2015 okkan and kirdemir 2016 it is widely recognized that the multi model ensemble mean of gcms has the potential to provide more reliable projections compared to individual gcms e g weigel et al 2008 knutti et al 2010 najafi and moradkhani 2016 wang et al 2018 duan et al 2019 in general multi model ensemble averaging methods are classified into two groups 1 simple arithmetic mean which assigns equal weights to all gcms regardless of their performance and 2 weighted averaging methods which apply different weights to gcms based on their relative performance in representing observed climate some studies show that the latter can yield superior results in comparison with the former e g casanova and ahrens 2009 coppola et al 2010 feng et al 2010 oh and suh 2016 however some other studies suggest that arithmetic mean is easier to implement and can better represent observed climate if ensemble members are produced independently e g lambert and boer 2001 peng et al 2002 moreover the equal weighting approach deserves attention due to the fact that modeling climate system involves significant uncertainties and there is no guarantee that better performing models over a limited historical period will also perform better in the future this can become more important considering that observations have already been used to calibrate gcms hence arithmetic mean can be considered as a more reliable method to combine ensemble members weigel et al 2010 in the present study the selected gcms table 3 are developed by distinct modeling groups and exhibit different skills in simulating precipitation and temperature abbasian et al 2018 therefore the results are presented for individual gcms along with the equally weighted multi model ensemble mean 4 results 4 1 predictor selection correlation analysis using spearman correlation coefficient ρ shows that four 2 5 2 5 large scale grid cells over the lake urmia basin constitute the optimal atmospheric domain for downscaling precipitation and temperature fig 1 the set of the most influential predictors are selected using ρ calculated between large scale reanalysis predictors spatially averaged over the atmospheric domain and station observations the correlation analysis and the modeling of precipitation occurrence in dry months june september are performed on a binary sequence of 0s and 1s where 0 and 1 represent the absence and presence of precipitation at each time step respectively table 6 presents the first three predictors with the largest correlations for precipitation occurrence and amount models and temperature showing statistically significant correlations at 95 confidence level 4 2 calibration and validation of downscaling models large scale climate predictors participate in ghlm s data level model to explain within station variability of precipitation or temperature the latitude longitude and elevation of stations are used in ghlm s station level to account for their between station variability various ghlm structures with different levels of complexity are analyzed for each variable precipitation occurrence and amount and temperature in each month and aic is used to select the parsimonious structure the formulations of ghlms and their corresponding aic values for precipitation amounts in january are presented in table 7 as an example the null model m0 has the simplest structure in which both data and station level models include intercept terms with no predictors the variation of the intercept of the data level model α among stations is characterized by the station level model the m4 model structure with p rate and rhum 700hpa in the data level model and latitude in the station level model has the lowest aic value and therefore is selected as the optimal ghlm structure for the downscaling of precipitation in january the optimal ghlm structures obtained for each month are applied to reanalysis predictors in the calibration period 1985 2005 the scatter plots of downscaled versus observed precipitation and temperature are shown in fig 2 the performance of downscaling is quantified using the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient c nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 calculated between downscaled and observed precipitation and temperature the c nse is 0 68 and 0 98 for precipitation and temperature respectively the statistical properties of observed and downscaled monthly precipitation and temperature considering all stations are presented in table 8 to illustrate precipitation temperature dependence structure for observed and downscaled data the scatter plots of monthly precipitation versus monthly temperature are illustrated in fig 3 the value of ρ between precipitation and temperature is 0 61 and 0 62 for observed and downscaled data respectively leave one station out cross validation is used to evaluate the performance of the multi site downscaling method in simulating precipitation and temperature at new stations not included in calibration abbasian et al 2020 fig 2 shows the scatter plots of downscaled versus observed precipitation and temperature in cross validation the statistical properties of downscaled data in validation are presented in table 8 the c nse of validation dataset is 0 52 and 0 95 for precipitation and temperature respectively 4 3 downscaling of precipitation and temperature from the outputs of gcms to examine climate change related changes in the future with respect to the historical period the calibrated downscaling models are used for the downscaling of monthly precipitation and temperature from the outputs of gcms table 3 in the historical and future periods under rcp4 5 and 8 5 emission scenarios the c nse for downscaled precipitation is 0 42 according to the multi model ensemble mean and varies from 0 20 canesm2 to 0 29 noresm m among gcms for temperature the c nse is 0 96 based on the multi model ensemble mean ranging from 0 93 noresm m to 0 95 hadgem2 cc the ρ between downscaled precipitation and temperature from the outputs of gcms varies between 0 64 miroc5 and 0 61 noresm m and is 0 62 in the multi model ensemble mean data 4 4 changes in precipitation and temperature under climate change fig 4 shows the changes in annual precipitation and temperature means in the future periods under climate scenarios designated rcp4 5 2020 2040 rcp4 5 2040 2060 rcp4 5 2060 2080 rcp8 5 2020 2040 rcp8 5 2040 2060 and rcp8 5 2060 2080 relative to the historical period 1985 2005 based on individual gcms and their multi model ensemble means all results hereafter are presented for the areal average of all stations over the lake urmia basin the projected precipitation change in rcp4 5 2020 2040 is 8 mm based on the multi model ensemble mean with the range of 8 24 mm considering all gcms in addition the projected precipitation change in rcp8 5 2020 2040 is 10 mm 16 47 mm temperature is projected to rise by 1 c 0 3 1 8 c in rcp4 5 2020 2040 and 1 3 c 0 6 2 3 c in rcp8 5 2020 2040 results show that a long term decreasing trend in annual precipitation over future periods can lead to 20 mm 63 15 mm and 25 mm 80 47 mm change in rcp4 5 2060 2080 and rcp8 5 2060 2080 respectively projections show that annual temperature will increase by 2 5 c 1 2 3 4 c and 4 0 c 2 3 5 4 c based on rcp4 5 2060 2080 and rcp8 5 2060 2080 respectively during winter months december to february snow accumulates and forms snowpack which is an important source of water supply for environmental and irrigation demands in spring and summer in the study area since snow to rain ratio and snow cover are related to negative temperatures bednorz 2004 the number of freezing months in the historical and future periods each of which containing 252 21 12 months in total is presented in table 9 june to august summer are the hottest months of the year in the lake urmia basin during the past decades the residents of the basin did not need to use cooling facilities because of moderate temperatures in summers recently however there has been a tendency to install and use air conditioners as the air temperature is rising temperatures over 26 c are likely to cause restlessness and persuade people to utilize air conditioners on this basis the number of months with temperatures over 26 c in the historical and future periods is presented in table 10 4 5 climatic water balance to investigate the combined effects of precipitation change and temperature rise on climate induced water deficit in the unit mm the climatic water balance is calculated which is the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration at a given location over a certain period of time the balance indicates whether atmospheric evaporative demand is met by received water from the atmosphere hence the positive and negative values of the climatic water balance represent climatic surplus or deficit in the water budget respectively the annual time series of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and climatic water balance based on the multi model ensemble means of gcms in the historical and future periods under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are illustrated in fig 5 potential evapotranspiration is calculated by the method of thornthwaite since monthly temperature is the only variable required in this method the monthly values of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are aggregated over january december to calculate annual time series the average values of annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration and climatic water balance are presented in table 11 4 6 bivariate analysis of meteorological drought using the ptdi meteorological drought is characterized using the ptdi which is proposed in the present study the analysis is performed based on monthly precipitation and temperature i e the time scale of the ptdi is one month to model precipitation temperature dependence structure parametric copulas described in table 4 with gamma for precipitation and gaussian for temperature marginal distributions are fitted to the monthly downscaled data in the historical period for each gcm the estimated parameters and the values of aic corresponding to canesm2 as an example are given in table 12 the bb8 copula 90 rotated consistently shows the best performance for all gcms ten thousand data points are simulated from the joint distributions to graphically examine the goodness of fit of the copula models fig 6 shows the contour plots of the density of copula models and the scatter plot of downscaled and simulated precipitation temperature data for all gcms the ptdi is calculated for monthly precipitation temperature data in the historical and future periods in the lake urmia basin the percentage of data points in each category of the ptdi table 1 is shown in fig 7 in the historical period about 45 of monthly records fall in the first extremely dry hot and second dry hot categories based on the individual gcms about 42 of data points are in the third category normal which consists of four decile ranges approximately 13 of the remaining data points are classified in the fourth wet cold and fifth extremely wet cold categories as the density of data records in the lower right region of the precipitation temperature scatter plot is low figs 3 and 6 the projected changes in the number of extremely dry hot and dry hot months are 3 1 5 3 6 in rcp4 5 2020 2040 and 3 1 0 5 2 in rcp8 5 2020 2040 the largest projected growth in the frequency of the first two categories of the ptdi is associated with rcp8 5 2060 2080 in which the multi model ensemble mean shows 11 5 increase with the range of 4 8 24 0 based on all gcms wheat is one of the major crops in the northwest of iran including the lake urmia basin because of the above average precipitation in this region nouri et al 2016 wheat production in the lake urmia basin is highly affected by precipitation and temperature conditions in april may and june nassiri et al 2006 nouri et al 2017 temperature increase would reduce the length of the growing period while precipitation decrease would cause water deficiencies both of which can lead to reduction in wheat yield nassiri et al 2006 therefore the methodology of the ptdi is also applied to the period of april june i e the time scale of the ptdi is 3 months and the time window is april june the scatter plots of downscaled data in april june and the contours of the joint precipitation temperature density functions are illustrated in fig 8 the percentages of data points that lie within each five categories of the ptdi are calculated for historical and future periods fig 9 4 7 analysis of meteorological drought using the spei and spi the proposed drought index in this study the ptdi provides a conceptually different approach from other indices to characterize meteorological drought however a further analysis of the effects of climate change on meteorological drought in the lake urmia basin is carried out based on the spei and spi as these are two widely used indices the monthly time series of the 12 month spei and spi in the historical and future periods under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are calculated for all gcms and the multi model ensemble means and presented in the supplementary material figs s1 s4 5 discussion this study presents a novel approach to assess projected changes in meteorological drought events under climate change based on the joint variability of precipitation temperature using a proposed drought index the ptdi section 3 the quantitative results of the application of the methodology to the lake urmia basin are presented in section 4 correlation analysis to identify the set of optimal large scale predictors for the downscaling of local precipitation and temperature section 4 1 shows that the most influential predictors include precipitation rate relative humidity air temperature and geopotential height table 6 this result is physically reasonable precipitation rate is the simulated precipitation by gcms and the reanalysis dataset and therefore directly connected with local precipitation widmann et al 2003 schmidli et al 2007 relative humidity presents the atmospheric water vapor content associated with the formation of clouds peixoto and oort 1996 geopotential height approximates the height of large scale atmospheric pressure above mean sea level it is an indicator of a relatively low pressure region i e pressure trough which is connected with the formation of clouds and precipitation sachindra et al 2014 regarding temperature geopotential height difference between two pressure levels e g 500 and 750 hpa is related to the average temperature between the levels milrad 2018 finally large scale air temperature is the upper level or surface temperature simulated by gcms and therefore linked to regional temperature the evaluation of the downscaling models which transform the selected large scale predictors to ground based precipitation and temperature shows that the performance of the models in calibration is satisfactory based on the c nse ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 the higher performance of downscaling for temperature is reflected in fig 2 as temperature data points are more closely scattered around the 1 1 line compared to precipitation this is partly due to the fact that precipitation generation mechanism is highly complex and cannot be fully characterized by large scale predictors schoof and pryor 2001 in addition previous studies show that lakes can affect local precipitation patterns e g wilson 1977 nicholls and toumi 2013 dai et al 2018 the performance of downscaling in terms of precipitation temperature dependence is satisfactory since the value of ρ in downscaled data is almost equal to that of observed data and the dependence structure of monthly precipitation temperature over the basin is well preserved in the downscaled data fig 3 the c nse the scatter plots fig 2 and the statistical properties table 8 of downscaled data in leave one station out cross validation show that the downscaling models can incorporate data from neighboring sites to downscale precipitation and temperature at new stations reasonably well for a further discussion on the performance of ghlm in multi site downscaling see abbasian et al 2020 the results of the downscaling of precipitation and temperature from the outputs of gcms in the historical period section 4 3 show that gcms can represent the observed climate in the lake urmia basin the comparatively higher overall performance of downscaling for the reanalysis dataset is due to the fact that in contrast to gcms the reanalysis dataset is quality controlled and corrected against observations and therefore treated as the simulations of an ideal gcm christensen et al 2001 besides gcms are not expected to reproduce observations at monthly or annual scales but to preserve the long term trend and variability of climate kharin et al 2007 loukas et al 2008 the multi model ensemble mean outperforms individual gcms based on the c nse shifts in the mean of precipitation and temperature in the future due to climate change are very important to local authorities since they are currently attempting to halt the desiccation of lake urmia and revitalize the lake gradually hence any decline in precipitation or increase in temperature can further complicate the restoration of the lake projected changes in precipitation and temperature under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios are presented in section 4 4 results for the period of 2020 2040 indicate that the majority of gcms project a small increase or decline in the mean of precipitation fig 4 the multi model ensemble mean shows an approximately 10 mm change in annual precipitation which is not statistically significant based on thet test at 95 significance level hence it can be inferred that precipitation will not change significantly over the next two decades results for temperature change on the other hand show that all gcms consistently project temperature rise in 2020 2040 fig 4 such that the multi model ensemble mean displays 1 and 1 3 c increase in annual temperature under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively which are statistically significant these findings imply that the consequences of temperature increase can be the main concern for restoring the lake urmia in the near future tracking the projections over 2020 2040 and 2060 2080 indicates that most of the gcms anticipate a long term decreasing trend in precipitation such that the multi model ensemble shows a statistically significant decline in 2060 2080 under rcp4 5 20 mm and rcp8 5 25 mm precipitation decline over time is accompanied by dramatic temperature rise leading to 2 5 and 4 0 c increase in rcp4 5 2060 2080 and rcp8 5 2060 2080 respectively based on the multi model ensemble mean most gcms project decreases in the number of months with negative temperatures in rcp4 5 2020 2040 and rcp8 5 2020 2040 by about 50 relative to the historical period table 9 this remarkable warming in the near future can adversely affect snowpack resources and consequently reduce streamflow in warm seasons further while summer temperatures have been below 26 c in the historical period most of the gcms project that temperature will exceed 26 c in the following decades under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios table 10 assuming that people use air conditioners 10 h a day on average during the months with temperatures over 26 c a typical household power consumption for air conditioning alone would be 600 kwh each month this can introduce new challenges to the energy sector of the region changes in climate related water deficit due to the combined effects of precipitation change and temperature increase under climate change are analyzed using the climatic water balance section 4 5 according to the aridity index the climate of a given location is classified as semi arid if the ratio of average annual precipitation to average annual potential evapotranspiration is between 0 20 and 0 50 unep 1992 the value of the index is 0 49 in the historical period table 11 and therefore the climate of the lake urmia basin is placed at the upper limit of the semi arid class however projections suggest that the value of the index will decrease over the future periods even in 2020 2040 in which a slight precipitation increase is anticipated by the multi model ensemble mean this implies that the climate of the lake urmia basin is projected to shift toward drier conditions in the future a visual inspection of annual time series fig 5 reveals an evident increasing trend in the magnitude of climate induced water deficit under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 mainly due to a monotonic increase in potential evapotranspiration followed by a long term decrease in precipitation the magnitude of water deficit can grow by 52 and 77 in 2060 2080 relative to the historical period under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively this can pose new challenges to agricultural production in the lake urmia basin including rainfed wheat which is one of the major crops in the region moreover considering that agriculture is the main source of income schmidt et al 2020 an increase in water deficit can further stimulate water withdrawal and diversion upstream of lake urmia to maintain agricultural production and therefore reduce inflows to the lake to a greater extent the impact of climate change on meteorological drought is assessed using the ptdi section 4 6 the methodology of the ptdi is applied to monthly precipitation temperature data graphical goodness of fit shows that the bb8 copula with the gamma and gaussian marginal distributions can adequately represent the dependence structure of precipitation temperature in the historical period fig 6 the results of the ptdi calculation using copula models shows that about 45 of precipitation temperature data points belong to extremely dry hot and dry hot categories of the ptdi in the historical period this shows that the ptdi reflects the nature of the semi arid climate of the lake urmia basin through the joint behavior of precipitation temperature when all months are analyzed together without isolating the seasonality all gcms project increases in the number of extremely dry hot and dry hot months in the next two decades under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this finding is consistent with the results obtained from the climatic water balance the frequency of precipitation temperature data points in the first two categories of the ptdi is expected to grow over the future periods leading to 11 5 increase in rcp8 5 2060 2080 based on the multi model ensemble mean the projected change is consistent among all gcms such that even canesm2 which projects 47 8 mm increase in precipitation in rcp8 5 2060 2080 shows a similar trend of change because of a large increase in the projected temperature i e 4 7 c it is worth noting that taking all gcms into account the range of projected increase in the number of extremely dry hot and dry hot months is 1 0 5 2 and 4 8 24 0 in rcp8 5 2020 2040 and rcp8 5 2060 2080 respectively this implies that the uncertainties associated with climate modeling become larger over time the ptdi is also calculated for the period of april june as wheat production efficiency is highly affected by precipitation and temperature conditions at this time of the year the analysis involves only april june excluding the rest of the year so that seasonality can be eliminated monthly precipitation is aggregated and monthly temperature is averaged over the period of april june i e the time scale of the index is 3 months results show that the period of april june is projected to become drier hotter in 2060 2080 based on all gcms under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios implying that rainfed agricultural products mainly wheat can be adversely affected in the future this result is graphically illustrated in fig 10 which shows that precipitation temperature data points in rcp8 5 2060 2080 are projected to shift toward the upper left corner of the scatter plot compared to the historical period explaining why the ptdi shows that the period of april june is expected to become drier hotter a visual inspection of the time series of the spei supplementary material figs s1 and s2 reveals that the duration and severity of meteorological drought are projected to grow over future periods relative to the historical period based on all gcms and the multi model ensembles means under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this long term increasing trend in drought characteristics is consistent with the results obtained from the ptdi as the spei takes the effects of temperature into account through potential evapotranspiration the time series of the spi supplementary material figs s3 and s4 however show that the duration and the severity of drought are projected to decrease based on the gcms which anticipate precipitation increase for example the simulations of the canesm2 under rcp8 5 suggest that the historical period would generally be a dry spell compared to the future periods supplementary material fig s4a because of the significant projected increase in precipitation in the future therefore the results of the spi are not consistent with the outcomes of the ptdi and spei as the spi does not represent the effects of temperature rise on meteorological drought 6 conclusion in this study meteorological drought is defined and characterized based on the joint variability of precipitation temperature the impacts of climate change on meteorological drought is then assessed using the proposed approach generalized hierarchical linear model ghlm which pools data from multiple stations while explaining station to station variability is used for the downscaling of monthly precipitation and temperature at multiple sites in the lake urmia basin for the historical 1985 2005 and future 2020 2040 2040 2060 and 2060 2080 periods under rcp4 5 and 8 5 emission scenarios the predictand of ghlm can follow a member of the exponential family of distributions owing to this property precipitation in dry months is downscaled through a two step approach in which the occurrence is modeled by a logistic hierarchical linear model to identify the time steps when precipitation occurs followed by estimating the amount of precipitation at those time steps using ghlm with a gamma distributed predictand ghlms are calibrated and validated using the ncep doe reanalysis dataset and the best ghlm structure is selected for each month and each predictand based on aic the outputs of nine cmip5 gcms are downscaled using the calibrated models in the historical and future periods the dependence structure of the downscaled precipitation temperature data is characterized using copulas for the individual gcms and the multi model ensemble mean the traditional deciles index is extended to a bivariate index called precipitation temperature deciles index ptdi to evaluate changes in future precipitation temperature conditions relative to the historical period based on all gcms simulations temperature is projected to increase in the lake urmia basin over all future periods under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios projections show that the frequency of freezing months will decline to almost half of its historical value and summer temperature will exceed 26 c in the next decades temperature is projected to increase by 2 5 c and 4 0 c in rcp4 5 2060 2080 and rcp8 5 2060 2080 respectively based on the multi model ensemble mean due to high uncertainties in simulating precipitation there is less agreement among gcms on even the direction of precipitation changes in the future periods however the multi model ensemble means show significant changes in rcp4 5 2060 2080 and rcp8 5 2060 2080 in which annual precipitation is projected to decrease by 20 and 25 mm respectively the near future is crucial to the restoration of lake urmia water resources development projects such as constructing new dams are already halted and local authorities have initiated a plan to reduce irrigation water use by 40 in the basin therefore climate change related decline in available water can introduce new challenges to the current mitigation measures characterizing meteorological drought using the ptdi in 2020 2040 indicates that although the multi model ensemble mean of gcms shows a slight increase in precipitation under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 all gcms project an increase in the number of extremely dry hot and dry hot months relative to the historical period this is mostly associated with large increases in projected temperature this result is also inferred from the climatic water balance which shows that climate induced water deficit is projected to intensify despite an approximately 10 mm increase in annual precipitation during 2020 2040 moreover all gcms including those anticipating significant precipitation increase project that the frequency of drought months will grow over 2040 2060 and 2060 2080 projected increase in extremely dry hot and dry hot months by all gcms under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 can adversely affect rainfed agriculture this can heighten the irrigation consumptive use of crops as well which is particularly important because agricultural activities are already blamed for the lake s water level decline one option to mitigate climate induced water deficiency is to update agricultural practices to use available water efficiently as current irrigation efficiency is as low as 30 modifying crop patterns planting dates and crop rotation i e planting alternative crops in consecutive seasons can also increase water productivity developing alternative sources of income such as reviving the tourism of the region and supporting industrial activities can lead to reduced water consumption in the basin and therefore provide a means for adapting to new climatic conditions overall results indicate that climate change can exacerbate existing environmental and socio economic issues in the lake urmia basin unless appropriate mitigation plans are devised and implemented funding sources this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the

5028,alpine environments are particularly vulnerable to climatic warming and long term observations suggest a shift of snow influenced river discharge towards earlier periods of the year for water resources management the seasonal patterns of discharge in alpine areas are particularly relevant as the shift to lower flows in summer and autumn combined with increased water demand could lead to water shortage in downstream catchments the storage of groundwater in alpine catchments could significantly modulate how changing climatic conditions influence the annual streamflow regime however groundwater storage and its buffering capacity in alpine areas remain poorly understood moreover studies on how climate change will impact water resources in alpine areas rarely consider the influence of geology in this paper catchment geology is used as a basis for the classification of future summer low flows behavior of several alpine catchments in switzerland based on the analysis of the relationship between low flow indicators and geology the role of unconsolidated quaternary deposits is explored we show that quaternary deposits play a critical role in the seasonal storage of groundwater which can contribute to rivers during low flow periods three climate change simulations based on extreme rcp 8 5 scenarios are fed into a conceptual hydrological model to illustrate the buffering role of groundwater past and future low flows normalized by mean past and future streamflows appear correlated with the percentage of unconsolidated quaternary deposits these results highlight that catchments with high groundwater contribution to streamflow relative to precipitation will have a slower decrease in future summer discharge therefore we propose two indicators that can be used to anticipate the response of future summers low flows in alpine areas to climate change the current winter low flows and the percentage of unconsolidated quaternary deposits of the catchments keywords hydrology alpine catchments groundwater storage snow climate change 1 introduction alpine areas greatly affect streamflow dynamics through their seasonal storage of water they are defined as mountainous regions with steep slopes snowmelt dominated located mostly above the tree line where little or no soil and vegetation are present hayashi 2020 during winter water is stored in the form of snow before being released during warmer periods by melt processes thus controlling the seasonal hydrograph freudiger et al 2017 this seasonal redistribution of water can significantly reduce the consequences of meteorological droughts in lowlands during summer beniston and stoffel 2014 rohrer et al 2013 however alpine areas are also highly sensitive to climate change climate change and the associated increasing temperatures result in shorter snow cover durations more precipitation is therefore falling as rain than as snow during the winter period harpold and brooks 2018 li et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 these changes in snowfall fraction will also lead to a decrease in seasonal snow accumulation which can be accentuated by more mid winter melt events cochand et al 2019a pavlovskii et al 2019 consequently winter low flows typical for alpine catchments are expected to become less extreme in magnitude laaha et al 2016 moreover the onset of snowmelt will be shifted toward earlier spring barnett et al 2005 godsey et al 2014 these changes will lead to a lower streamflow peak occurring earlier in the year jenicek et al 2018 and a decrease of spring streamflow barnhart et al 2016 teutschbein et al 2015 these changes will probably also lead to a reduction in stream discharges in summer and autumn barnett et al 2005 berghuijs et al 2014 lauber et al 2014 musselman et al 2017 which can considerably affect water resources management of downstream catchments however hydrological modelling has already shown that snowmelt alone cannot explain the variability of future summer low flows jenicek et al 2016 elevation influences local air temperature and thus changes in snow storage marty et al 2017 showed that in the european alps relative swe could potentially decrease about 50 at high elevations 3 000 m a s l and almost no snow might accumulate at elevations lower than 1 200 m a s l by the end of the century the largest absolute decrease in maximum annual swe was predicted for elevations from 2 000 to 2 700 m a s l jenicek et al 2018 a considerable proportion of hydrological research dedicated to alpine catchments focused on the analysis of alpine stream hydrographs with snowmelt processes during spring and early summer garvelmann et al 2017 jodar et al 2016 lauber et al 2014 staudinger et al 2017 zuecco et al 2018 however hydrological processes that pertain to the subsurface can also be highly relevant groundwater discharge to streams is often the principal component of the streamflow from alpine basins during extended periods of the year especially during winter low flows clow et al 2003 cras et al 2007 hood et al 2006 huth et al 2004 jodar et al 2017 liu et al 2004 to date it remains unclear to what extent groundwater stored in alpine catchments can mitigate the potentially adverse effects of climate change hayashi 2020 viviroli et al 2007 thus there is an urgent need to better understand the capacity of alpine areas to store groundwater as well as the associated dynamics in a recent review paper on the main alpine aquifers across the world hayashi 2020 highlighted the role of aquifers in unconsolidated deposits to explain the fast recession of discharge after the recharge period i e snowmelt or rainfall events followed by a slower recession that sustains discharge over a long period according to hayashi 2020 this two phase recession is likely controlled by groundwater system dynamics spencer et al 2019 showed the importance of both fractured permeable bedrock and glacial till deposits for runoff generation in canada s rocky mountains wirth et al 2020 showed that quaternary deposits are important for groundwater contribution to streamflow in the swiss prealps several recent publications highlighted the role of quaternary deposits to store groundwater in alpine regions christensen et al 2020 arnoux et al 2020 however the linkage between geology groundwater and streamflow regime response to climate change has not previously been addressed explicitly and is the purpose of this paper in addition to the important practical implications of this situation concerning water resources management the scientific understanding of hydrogeological processes in alpine areas remains in its infancy some studies have shown that a change in snow regime affects groundwater recharge tague and grant 2009 and thus impacts streamflow godsey et al 2014 in snow dominated areas the main recharge period occurs during the melt period and there is little recharge during the winter period the total amount of snow precipitation in winter affects groundwater recharge and hence streamflow during dry summer periods beaulieu et al 2012 van loon et al 2015 however the link between groundwater storage and streamflow regime changes is difficult to determine in this context the main objectives of this study are 1 to determine if and how current low flow rates are related to the geology of alpine catchments 2 to discuss the consequences of climate change for future winter and summer low flows and evaluate the influence of dynamic groundwater storage on flow rates 3 to establish the link between geology and catchment response to climate change for this purpose we have selected 13 catchments across the swiss alps we first compared their low flow characteristics with the surface geology to classify them subsequently past and future streamflow dynamics were simulated using the conceptual hydrological hbv model seibert 2000 we focused on groundwater contribution to streamflows and its impact on summer low flows to better represent the streamflow and groundwater dynamics we consider the seasonal and inter annual variability in streamflow and groundwater storage by running three of the latest simulations of the extreme rcp8 5 ch2018 climate change scenario continuously from the past starting 1981 until the end of this century ending 2099 2 study sites thirteen gauged alpine catchments were selected across the swiss alps their surface areas range from 8 1 to 55 3 km2 allowing a relation between groundwater storage and specific catchment characteristics their mean elevations range from 1 702 to 2 567 m asl high enough to be considered as alpine catchments but also without or only very small areas covered by glaciers they were also selected as they are nearly undisturbed by man made infrastructure dams pumping etc three exceptions can be indicated catchment 1 for which a known volume of water is pumped for drinking water and 4 and 5 which can have various minor influences i e low volume of pumping or water transfer the location of the chosen catchments is illustrated in fig 1 and their main characteristics are described in table 1 fig 2 illustrates the distribution of elevation versus slopes these catchments are all snow melt dominated with a snow cover period of a few months a snow accumulation period between 5 and 7 months and a snowmelt period of 2 to 3 months based on 2016 2018 snow data see part 3 1 for the description of snow data catchments with the strongest snow accumulation are 6 2 9 1 and the ones with the lowest accumulation rates are 10 and 8 catchment 1 has been monitored for a few years and its hydrogeology has already been studied see cochand et al 2019b for more details catchments 3 to 13 are part of the swiss hydrological network hug and some of them have been considered in previous studies focusing on future climate impacts or low flows analyses addor et al 2014 jenicek et al 2018 2016 staudinger and seibert 2014 staudinger et al 2017 2015 but without specifically focusing on the role of groundwater and geology in catchment dynamics which is the purpose of this paper the geology of the catchments has been extracted from the surface geological maps 1 25 000 from swisstopo 2018 in this paper we focus on the role of deposits common for each catchment which are the quaternary deposits these deposits are mainly talus moraine alluvium or cones the permeability of quaternary deposits can be variable but the rocks are characterized by relatively high porosity and permeability for example in the canadian rockies muir et al 2011 observed that talus has a very high hydraulic conductivity 0 01 to 0 03 m s and limited storage capacity with sometimes a residence time scale of less than a week conversely moraines have been regularly observed to have lower hydraulic conductivities in the approximate ranges of 10 6 to 10 4 m s for lateral moraines and 10 5 to 10 4 m s for frontal moraines vincent et al 2019 they are mostly composed of clays silts sands and gravels where the sands and gravels can be many orders of magnitude higher in permeability compared to the fractured crystalline rocks there is no information available on the depths of these deposits for the study catchment except catchment 12 and 1 for catchment 12 the estimated average is in the range of 0 5 10 m floriancic et al 2018 for catchment 1 a geophysical study has estimated alluvium sediment to be at a maximum 38 m depth in the valley bottom geotest 1963 in the literature the thickness of quaternary sediments has been estimated to be up to 30 40 m in the meadow christensen et al 2020 the thickness of the moraine has been estimated to be up to 16 30 m in the canadian rockies langston et al 2011 hayashi 2020 acknowledge that the total thickness of alpine sediments such as talus may not be the controlling parameter of groundwater storage but rather the bedrock topography underneath the deposits as the depth of quaternary sediments is not available for all studied catchments the percentage of quaternary cover the surface of quaternary deposits divided by the catchment surface is used as a metric to compare low flows indicators to this specific type of geology 3 methods the alpine catchments are firstly classified based on their geology and on their capacity to store water derived from a set of low flow indicators section 3 4 then based on historical data the discharges are simulated with a conceptual hydrological model which is calibrated to fit historical streamflow data with a focus on winter low flows section 3 3 finally we apply climate change projections section 3 2 to the calibrated models to determine the role of groundwater in buffering future streamflow regime changes 3 1 data collection and processing daily gridded precipitation and 2 m high air temperature data 2 km resolution from 1961 to 2018 are provided by the swiss federal office of meteorology and climatology ch2018 2018a an area averaged time series of precipitation and air temperature is obtained for each catchment by averaging at each time step the values of all grid cells normalized by the area of the cells contained in the catchment between 2 and 11 grid cells per catchment daily discharge data were obtained from gauging stations monitored by the swiss federal office for the environment ofev catchments 3 to 13 by the canton of ticino 2 and by the university of neuchâtel 1 the availability period of the monitored streamflow data for each catchment is summarised in table 1 based on the analysis of the geology underlying the gauging stations we assume that groundwater flowing below gauging stations i e bypassing them is negligible table 1 mean daily snow water equivalent swe data were available for three years and for each catchment period 01 09 2015 31 08 2018 these data were based on daily snow depth observations from over 300 swiss snow monitoring stations the observations were assimilated into a physically based snowpack model run at 250 m spatial and hourly temporal resolution which were then upscaled to one average swe value per catchment and per day details about monitoring data snowpack modeling and data assimilation methods are available from griessinger et al 2019 and winstral et al 2019 these daily mean swe data are used here to calibrate the snow routine of the hbv model see section 3 3 3 the dominant geology per catchment is derived from the swiss geological map 1 25 000 swisstopo 2018 topographic watershed and slopes are obtained using the digital elevation model at 25 m swisstopo 2008 on arcgis software 10 4 1 3 2 climate projections the recent swiss climate change scenarios 2018 data set ch2018 2018a is used to simulate the impact of future changes in air temperature and precipitation on dynamic groundwater storage in alpine catchments and its influence on stream discharge the ch2018 data set is based on global climate modeling combined with downscaling using regional climate models and quantile mapping ch2018 2018b the data set consists of daily gridded air temperature and precipitation from 1981 to 2099 at a resolution of 2 km catchment average time series of daily precipitation and air temperature are obtained by averaging all grid cells normalized by the area of the cells contained in the catchment between 2 and 11 grid cells per catchment it is important to note that the climate data may not replicate the reality because of the difficulty in accurately determining temperature and precipitation in highly heterogeneous environments such as alpine areas besides a resolution of 2 km is higher than what would be necessary for the size of our study catchments these sources of uncertainty are acceptable for our study as the aim is to determine the sensitivity of the catchments to changes also focusing our analysis on relative differences between a reference period and future climate change impact simulations reduces the uncertainty linked to systematic biases following the recommendations of the ch2018 report ch2018 2018a 30 year means are compared a reference period ref 1982 2011 is compared to three future periods 2035 2020 2049 2060 2045 2074 and 2085 2070 2099 three climate change model chains are selected because of their spring temperature evolutions in the two regions chaw and chae where most of the study catchments are located fig 1 we selected rcp 8 5 scenarios to cover the greatest impact on the hydrological cycle in addition we selected projections with a strong increase in spring temperature to explicitly study the effect of groundwater on future summer low flows high spring temperature affects snowmelt the most and therefore groundwater recharge during the snowmelt period the three chosen model chains have also different seasonal evolutions of precipitation as summarized in table 2 scenario s1 has the highest increase in spring temperature s3 follows a high increase in winter and spring temperature along with a strong decrease in summer precipitation and s2 is between both with a lower increase in winter and spring temperatures than s1 and a lower decrease in summer precipitations than s3 3 3 model 3 3 1 description the hbv model bergström 1995 lindström et al 1997 is a bucket type model in this study hbv light is used seibert and vis 2012 this model uses different model routines to simulate catchment scale discharge based on time series of daily precipitation and air temperature as well as estimates of daily potential evapotranspiration a detailed description of the model can be found in the work of bergström 1995 lindström et al 1997 and seibert 2000 the model consists of four model routines to simulate catchment runoff 1 the snow routine snow accumulation and melt are computed by a degree day method 2 the soil routine where infiltration to the upper groundwater box and actual evapotranspiration are simulated as functions of the water storage in the soil box 3 the response routine where runoff is computed as a function of water storage in an upper fast and a lower slow groundwater reservoir and 4 the routing routine where a triangular weighting function routes the runoff to the outlet of the catchment routines 2 to 4 are run here in a lumped mode for the entire catchment the snow routine is run based on a set of elevation bands see section 3 3 3 the corresponding simulated snow melt is then averaged at catchment scale and together with liquid rainfall fed into routines 2 to 4 this conceptual model is based on the following assumptions 1 there is no other inflow into the stream except flows generated by the above routines and 2 aquifers respond as linear reservoirs the groundwater storage is the sum of water contained in the two upper and lower groundwater boxes li et al 2015 potential evapotranspiration is calculated with oudin s formula based on latitude and daily air temperature oudin et al 2005 actual evapotranspiration is then computed by reducing the potential evapotranspiration as a function of soil water deficit seibert and vis 2012 the sensitivity and uncertainty of the model parameters of the hbv model have been widely studied in sweden and norway bergström 1976 mapped the mean square error function of streamflow by the trial and error method seibert 1997 found that the sensitivity was hard to be described quantitatively since the sensitivity changes greatly with different parameter values for snowmelt dominated catchments the main uncertainties come from snow parameters mainly the threshold air temperature for snow accumulation and snowmelt and the degree day factor and the recession coefficients of both groundwater boxes li et al 2015 compared to the original hbv model the version hbv light used here has a warming up period one year is used in our case with no limitation for the routing parameter see seibert and vis 2012 for detailed information 3 3 2 model calibration and validation model calibration and validation are done in three steps 1 snow parameters are calibrated independently on the three years of available swe data 2015 2018 2 hydrological parameters are then calibrated on the entire period of measurements until 2015 and finally 3 the joint performance of all model parameters are validated on the last three years of measurements 2015 2018 simulations are run for nine catchments 1 3 6 7 9 10 11 12 13 the four other catchments 8 5 2 and 4 are not considered in the simulations the main reasons for this choice are short time series and lack in streamflow measurements 2 and 8 or anthropogenic influences such as water abstraction on the streamflow 4 and 5 these last four catchments are therefore not presented in the results based on simulations see part 4 3 3 2 1 snow parameters calibration catchments were divided into elevation zones from 6 to 11 zones depending on their elevation ranges see table 1 the elevation ranges are not used for the generation of streamflow but they allow the calibration of both precipitation and air temperature gradients for future periods the gradients are kept constant these two gradients and the snow routine parameters threshold temperature degree day factor seasonal variability in degree day factor were first calibrated to reproduce daily swe data c f section 3 1 from september 1 2015 to august 31 2018 as only one threshold parameter for snow accumulation and melt is implemented in the hbv model snow routine it was included as part of the calibration this first step of the calibration is conducted for each catchment using the genetic calibration algorithm gab of hbv by which optimized parameter sets are found by consecutive evolution of parameter sets using selection and recombination seibert and vis 2012 the objective function for this optimization is obtained following an integrated multivariable model calibration procedure seibert 2000 where a combination of two criteria is defined as the objective function these criteria are the model efficiency for swe nseswe nash sutcliffe 1970 and the mean absolute normalized error for swe mneswe expressed as follows 1 n s e s w e 1 h obs h sim 2 h obs h obs 2 2 m n e s w e 1 h obs h sim h obs where hobs and hsim are the observed and the simulated snow water equivalent the objective function is a combination of these two criteria giving the same weights to each of them the aim was to reproduce the current snow accumulation and melt in order to get reliable future simulations the model was validated using data from 2015 to 2018 snow conditions did not change significantly during this period different calibration trials might result in different parameter sets with similar model performances during calibration but different behavior during other periods to better address this parameter uncertainty the model was calibrated 10 times starting each time from different initial parameter sets and resulting in 10 best parameter sets for the search range of the snow parameters see table s1 in the supplementary material these 10 sets were then used to simulate 10 different time series for all simulation periods most of the further analyses were then based on these 10 series for both reference and future periods additionally during snow parameter calibration a check was made to ensure no unrealistic snow accumulation series were modelled as already observed with the hbv snow routine in the past jenicek et al 2018 for this step any simulation resulting in multi year snow accumulation snow tower building up freudiger et al 2017 is assumed to be unrealistic if it was the case the initial search ranges for the snow parameters were arbitrarily reduced within their range of variation to avoid this artifact the nse coefficient varies between and 1 with a value of 1 representing a perfect reproduction of the time series and a negative value indicating that the model performs worse than the simplest possible model which is taking the average observed value as a model it is important to point out here that this nse value if computed on strongly seasonal signals needs to result in very high values to indicate good model performance schaefli and gupta 2007 this explains the very high nseswe values 0 90 obtained for all case studies table 3 3 3 2 2 soil and groundwater parameter calibration in a second step the model is calibrated to reproduce observed streamflow from the beginning of the monitoring period see table 1 for monitoring period per catchment until 31 august 2015 as the last three years of measurements 2015 2018 are used for validation see below all parameters except the snow ones are calibrated using the inverse automatic calibration software pest doherty 2005 pest is a model independent non linear parameter estimation and optimization package it reads files of input parameters and target outputs the algorithms are based on the implementation of the gauss marquardt levenberg algorithm to allow a fast and efficient convergence towards the best value of the objective function it is the minimum of a weighted least square sum of the difference between simulated and observed discharge calibration is conducted to reproduce streamflow with a specific interest in low flows using the following objective function ф 3 ϕ i 1 n q i obs q i sim w i 2 where q i obs and q i sim are the observed and simulated catchment streamflow rates and wi is the weight associated with the streamflow value at the time step i accordingly higher weights are used on low flows see supplementary material table s3 for weights pest approaches an optimized parameter set within the specified ranges of the parameters doherty and johnston 2003 the optimization algorithm is run once for each of the ten best snow parameter sets identified in the previous set resulting in a total of ten optimized parameter sets per catchment because it is a non unique problem different initial parameters are used to avoid the stay in the local minima of the objective function these ten parameter sets were considered as representative of catchment variability in response to extreme climate change scenarios because the variability of parameters and especially recession coefficients are well constrained by the higher weight on winter low flows during a long period of time to assess the quality of the calibration the mean flow rate volumetric error mneq the nash sutcliffe efficiency for discharge nseq and for log q nselnq between observed and simulated streamflow are calculated on the calibration period and on a three years validation period 2015 2018 they are expressed as follows 4 n s e q 1 i 1 n q i obs q i sim 2 i 1 n q i obs q obs 2 5 n s e l n q 1 i 1 n l n q i obs l n q i sim 2 i 1 n lnq i obs lnq obs 2 6 m n e q 1 i 1 n q i obs q i sim i 1 n q i obs where q i obs and q i sim are the observed and simulated catchment streamflow rates at the time step i these three indicators eqs 4 5 and 6 are not used as objective functions but are rather calculated to evaluate the quality of the calibration performed with pest 1 the mean performance of the ten model runs with the optimized parameter sets are presented in table 4 and table 5 for the calibration and the validation period the three coefficients indicate good overall model performances for both periods even with a higher weight on low flows in the objective function as the model simulates satisfactory both high and low streamflow i e values nseq nselnq and mneq between 0 5 and 1 3 4 low flow indicators low flow indicators are used to compare the catchments regarding their potential to store groundwater the q95 q50 discharge exceeded 95 of the time divided by median discharge ratio has already been used in low flows studies in swiss catchments carlier et al 2018 2019 these authors showed that large dynamic groundwater storage ensures high groundwater contribution during low flows and high q95 q50 ratios in alpine catchments as the winter low flow period is long compared to the low flow period of catchments with more rainfall driven hydrological regimes from 4 to 9 months for our studied catchments depending on the snow cover duration the winter flow index wfi is often used cochand et al 2019b hayashi 2020 paznekas and hayashi 2015 these authors have shown that wfi can reflect the groundwater contribution to streamflow a higher wfi indicating more groundwater contribution cochand et al 2019b paznekas and hayashi 2015 it is here obtained as follows 7 wfi q n m 7 q mean where qnm7 is the minimum discharge over seven consecutive days during the winter period from november to june and qmean is the mean annual discharge we follow the definition from the paper of cochand et al 2019b it is important to note that this study used a slightly different definition of the wfi paznekas and hayashi 2015 used the specific average flow for january and february while cochand et al 2019b used the minimum discharge over seven consecutive days this latter definition is considered to be more appropriate given the variability of the studied catchments and to be able to compare them between each other for many of the catchments the low flow period varies from february to june similarly to wfi the summer low flow index sfi is calculated with the qnm7 in the summer months from july to september besides as the main period of groundwater storage increase is during snowmelt we decided to use also the obtained dynamic groundwater storage dgs divided by the mean maximum snow water equivalent dgs swemax as an indicator of groundwater contribution to streamflow for alpine catchments this dgs is calculated from the model simulations and is the difference between the minimum and maximum groundwater level in the two combined groundwater reservoirs described above upper and lower these water levels computed by the model are not calibrated with or compared to measured groundwater levels there are no piezometers in most of the study catchments moreover the groundwater boxes of the model do not represent a specific aquifer and cannot be compared to a point measurement such as water level in a piezometer two different dgs components are defined dgsn during the recharge period from low to high level and dgsn 1 during the recession period from high to low level they are expressed as follows 8 dg s n h n h n 9 dg s n 1 h n h n 1 where hn is the maximum groundwater level in the combined upper and lower groundwater reservoirs see section 3 3 1 of the year n hn is the minimum of the same year n and hn 1 is the minimum of the following year the mean dgs is the mean of both dgsn and dgsn 1 dgs and swemax used in the index are both mean values calculated over the entire period of simulation based on historical data calibration and validation periods dgs swemax varies between 0 3 and 0 8 for our catchments a dgs swemax close to 1 means that the majority of snowmelt contributes to groundwater storage the low flow indicators presented here are summarized in table 6 4 results and discussion in the following we first compare the low flow characteristics of all selected catchments with the surface geology then we analyze the evolution of discharge in response to climate change scenarios in this part we focus on relative changes between the reference period and the future periods rather than absolute changes in simulated discharge to be able to compare the catchments between each other 4 1 relationship between low flow behavior and geology 4 1 1 low flow indicators the low flow indicators q95 q50 wfi and dgs swemax are strongly positively correlated fig 3 and detailed values in the supplementary material table s4 i e if the dgs swemax increases the wfi fig 3 and the q95 q50 not shown increase this relationship confirmes the previous findings see section 3 4 that catchments with high wfi q95 q50 and dgs swemax are those catchments that have a high groundwater contribution to streamflow relative to the amount of precipitation they receive given the strong correlation of the two low flow indicators based on historical data q95 q50 and wfi fig 3a we only consider wfi in the rest of the study the correlation between the data based wfi and the model based dgs swemax is expected because an important flow rate after a prolonged winter recession requires a high dynamic groundwater storage in the model this nevertheless gives confidence in the dgs swemax indicator which is based on a simple hydrological model albeit calibrated with a special focus on low flows the range of variation of wfi is surprisingly high given that they are all alpine catchments with snow dominated hydrological streamflow regimes but without significant glacier cover it varies between 0 08 for 8 and 10 and 0 34 for 11 fig 3 based on these values three clusters of similar values can be defined catchments 11 1 12 and 2 have a high groundwater storage potential 0 25 wfi 0 35 catchments 3 4 13 5 6 a medium 0 15 wfi 0 25 and catchments 7 10 9 and 8 a low 0 wfi 0 15 in the literature wfi varies between 0 05 and 0 28 for large alpine catchments drainage areas 250 km2 hayashi 2020 and between 0 28 and 0 10 for some swiss alpine catchments cochand et al 2019b 4 1 2 low flow indicators and geology both wfi and dgs swemax are positively correlated with the relative amount of quaternary deposits fig 4 hence the results highlight the importance of unconsolidated quaternary deposits such as moraines alluvium and talus in storing groundwater these deposits are typical for alpine areas this result gives evidence for the fact that in the swiss alps the seasonal groundwater storage is strongly influenced by the local geology even if more catchments would be required to statistically validate this relationship other groundwater systems such as karstic or fractured bedrock systems can also jointly interact with quaternary deposits to store groundwater for example for catchment 1 an evaporitic zone and quaternary deposits contribute significantly to winter low flows cochand et al 2019b for catchment 12 weathered bedrock and quaternary deposits contribute significantly to winter low flows floriancic et al 2018 this could explain why it plots toward higher wfi in fig 4a the recent literature review of hayashi 2020 highlights the important role of quaternary deposits in storing groundwater in alpine regions it has been shown that groundwater storage can be controlled by the combination of quaternary deposits for example talus and meadow in the andean mountains glas et al 2019 or talus and moraine in the swiss alps cochand et al 2019b in a recent review hayashi 2020 hypothesized that groundwater storage in alpine areas is probably controlled by the combination of bedrock topography covered by quaternary deposits or by the permeability variation inside moraines and talus we suggest that another reason explaining the importance of unconsolidated deposits is that they prevent fast runoff of melt and rainwater thus maintaining groundwater recharge irrespectively of the aquifer type that is responsible for groundwater storage this mechanism could be particularly important for recharge of fractured bedrocks which often feature limited infiltration capacity thus normally favoring runoff however it is important to note that the surface slopes could indirectly affect subsurface and surface hydraulic gradients and hence the rates at which the water is drained out of the system the mean slope and the percentage of quaternary deposits are both intrinsically linked the mean slope increases when the percentage of quaternary deposits decreases and the role of slope cannot be distinctly explored see fig s4 in supplementary material following the discussion concerning the role of unconsolidated quaternary deposits in storing groundwater their hydrologic response to climate change is further explored and associate with geological conditions and storage dynamics 4 1 3 streamflow with past meteorological conditions 1968 2017 meteorological changes from 1968 to 2018 are as follows data not shown mean annual precipitation stays constant the temperature increases evaporation increases but stays small mean et from 170 to 300 mm yr depending on the catchments observed historical streamflow data and corresponding swe data are presented for some of the catchments to determine whether relevant changes in seasonal streamflow can already be observed in response to the increase in air temperature during recent decades fig 5 the changes in observed discharge are compared with changes in simulated swe on two 30 year mean periods for the catchments with a long period of streamflow monitoring fig 5 the results of the simulations show a decrease in mean simulated swe for all catchments fig 5 b maximum swe on a 30 year average follows a decrease for all catchments ranging from approx 65 mm to 140 mm in may 11 or june 13 7 3 over the 1988 2017 period compared to the 1968 1999 period fig 5 b as shown in fig 5a the streamflow increases in may and decreases in july because snowmelt starts and finishes earlier in the year thereafter streamflow decreases in the summer months from july to september or to october and increases for the rest of the year overall the mean annual streamflow remains constant throughout the years except a slightly positive annual trend for catchment 7 4 2 discharge evolution with climate change in the following the annual and seasonal evolutions of discharge under climate change scenarios and the factors influencing it are described and discussed the aim is to link the discharge regime evolution in response to climate change and groundwater storage and therefore geology 4 2 1 mean annual changes as expected all catchments are affected by a decrease in snow water equivalent in the future periods for the three scenarios due to the increase of air temperature during spring and winter both the reduction of snow cover duration and the rise in the air temperature increase the potential evapotranspiration the simulated actual evapotranspiration increases from 150 mm year for the reference period from 1982 to 2011 to 200 mm year by the 2085 period for the studied catchments data not shown future evapotranspiration represents for some catchments twice the actual evapotranspiration in the reference period ex catchment 6 from 200 to 400 mm yr by the end of the century with s3 fig 6 d however the calculated evapotranspiration is limited regarding the increase in air temperatures because of shallow soils in alpine areas not taking into account the depth of soils in alpine areas the annual evapotranspiration remains limited but can still become an important factor in the annual water budget in alpine areas in the future in fig 6 the results of the parameters for the simulation of six catchments for s3 are shown the catchment selection is based on their wfi values the selected catchments have wfi values covering the full range of variation from 0 08 10 to 0 34 11 with 1 3 6 and 7 between the response of the mean annual streamflow to climate change varies for different scenarios and catchments all catchments show a decreasing trend in mean annual streamflow by the 2085 period this decrease ranges from approx 150 mm yr for catchments 11 and 3 to 400 mm yr for catchments 6 and 10 it represents a streamflow decrease by 20 for 6 and 30 for 10 and 11 these changes can be mainly explained by a decrease in precipitation fig 6 a affecting all catchments for the 2085 period maximum decrease of 16 5 in mean for 10 except catchments 3 and 11 which show an increase in annual precipitation 1 4 and 0 9 in mean for 3 and 11 respectively a further explanation for streamflow reduction is the continuous increase in evapotranspiration as it is the case for 11 and 3 groundwater storage shows similar variations as streamflow with a slight decrease for the 2085 period from 10 to 20 in mean except for catchments 3 and 6 for which mean groundwater storage increases by 10 to 15 for the 2085 period respectively fig 6 e to explain these annual variations it is necessary to analyze the seasonal variations of groundwater storage and streamflow with scenarios s1 and s2 mean annual streamflow and groundwater storage do not show significant trends or follow a slight increase for the 2085 period compared to the reference period data not shown 4 2 2 mean seasonal variations the seasonal variations are compared between the reference and the 2085 period future precipitation patterns between the three scenarios s1 s3 are as follows for s1 mean seasonal precipitation stays relatively constant except for catchments 3 and 11 where they slightly increase in summer for s2 precipitation increases in winter and slightly decreases in summer except for catchments 3 and 11 where precipitation stays constant in summer and for s3 precipitation stays relatively constant during winter and decreases in summer detailed plots available in supplementary material fig s2 the simulated evapotranspiration increases mainly during spring due to earlier snowmelt and higher temperatures combined with high water availability in the soil see fig s2 future simulated evapotranspiration ranging from few mm month to 120 mm month in the 2085 period can significantly reduce water availability for streamflow in summer the simulated swemax is lower and appears 1 to 2 months earlier for all catchments and scenarios fig s2 in response streamflow peaks and the main recharge period occur 1 to 2 months earlier and the maximum streamflow decreases the simulated groundwater storage increases in winter because of a shorter mean snow cover period and therefore a longer period for recharge for scenario s3 the mean groundwater storage decreases in summer for the 2085 period for most of the catchments for scenarios s1 and s2 the summer groundwater storage increases for catchments 6 9 11 3 13 or decreases catchments 1 7 12 and 10 fig s2 this increase is due to the melt recharge during winter and spring and partly due to an increase in summer precipitation for example for catchments 3 and 11 with s1 the groundwater minimum tends to shift from winter to summer for the 2085 period the differences in scenarios s3 s2 s1 highlight the fact that groundwater storage also depends on spatial precipitation patterns to summarize for all scenarios and catchments for the 2085 period relative to the reference period the differences in groundwater storage are the following 1 a lower decrease in winter 2 a lower and earlier recharge during the melt period 3 a more pronounced decrease in summer and 4 a higher increase in autumn due to more liquid precipitation based on the simulations the fraction of streamflow originating from snowmelt to total streamflow in june and july decreases for the 2085 period and almost completely disappears at the lowest elevations for example catchment 10 as mentioned earlier the climate change scenarios selected for this study represent a strong warming trend and therefore entail a strong reduction in snowmelt however the evolution of snowmelt and corresponding streamflow generation is still in agreement with what has already been shown in previous studies e g jenicek et al 2018 consequently the impact of snowmelt on streamflow in alpine catchments will not be discussed in detail in this paper the decrease in summer streamflow is mainly influenced by the shift of the timing of snowmelt for example a decrease of 90 of streamflow in july and 80 in august is observed for 6 with s3 fig 7 h the future summer streamflow depends on previous hydrological conditions precipitation patterns evapotranspiration and groundwater contribution for all scenarios and for all catchments streamflow increases in winter december to february ranging from a few mm month to around 100 mm month in january february subsequently for almost all catchments streamflow decreases in summer from a few mm month to around 50 mm month in august september fig s2 furthermore snowmelt precipitation and groundwater maintain summer low flows higher than historic winter low flows current winter low flows therefore appear to form a lower bound for future summer low flows as the mean future summer low flows stay above the current mean winter low flows moreover the low flow period starts to shift from winter to summer in fig 7 the discharges of four catchments are presented the selection is based on their wfi range from 0 15 to 0 34 and is also based on the availability of a gauging station above 1300 m a s l furthermore these catchments are interesting because they will continue to show a snowmelt dominated regime even with the considered climate change scenarios the other catchments are presented in the supplementary material fig s2 the differences in catchment responses in summer low flows due to their hydrogeological characteristics become more apparent for s3 than for s2 fig 7 or for s1 fig s2a indeed in this scenario the high flows are smaller and the recession durations are longer fig 7 this is due to an earlier snowmelt peak because of higher temperatures in spring and no increase in summer precipitations table 2 and fig s2c in fig 8 the seasonal difference between reference and the 2085 period δq δswe and δ p et of catchments 11 and 3 for scenarios s1 s2 and s3 are presented these two catchments are discussed in more detail because they are both located close to each other in the east part of switzerland at similar altitudes with similar changes in p t and et for streamflow the variations of 3 are higher than for 11 whereas variations of swe fig 8b and e and p et fig 8c and f are similar for these two catchments in future scenarios the changes in simulated streamflow in august can be described as follows for s1 a decrease of 10 7 mm month for 3 fig 8a and an increase of 11 5 mm month for 11 fig 8b for s2 a decrease of 43 30 mm month for 3 fig 8a and fig 7b and almost no change for 11 fig 8b and fig 7a for s3 a decrease of 45 29 mm month for 3 fig 8a and fig 7f and of 29 13 mm month for 11 fig 8b and fig 7e these differences between 3 and 11 behaviors can be explained by the differences in groundwater storage and thus in geology facing a similar climatic evolution catchment 11 has a slower decrease in discharge because of the buffer effect of groundwater it is therefore able to maintain a similar quantity of water for a longer time without water input from rain or snowmelt it is therefore less sensitive to climate change as its changes in high or low flows are smoother than a catchment with lower groundwater storage potential as catchment 3 in similar climate change conditions however it is important to note that we refer to relative changes and not to the absolute quantity of water available in the river which can also be relevant for water management besides if a catchment is located in an area with an increase in precipitation during summer these differences cannot be identified 4 2 3 predictions of future summer low flows and geology given the importance of future low water periods in alpine areas we provide some useful elements to better predict their future dynamics we have shown that even in the far future summer low flows are not as extreme as current winter low flows in alpine catchments because their duration is shorter between 2 and 4 months and recharge by precipitation occurs in the studied catchments streamflow is provided for 4 to 9 months without precipitation input as shown by historically measured streamflows therefore the current winter low flow constitutes a lower bound for the future summer low flow the comparisons between wfi based on historical data and future 2085 sfi mean on 30 years on the 2085 period for the three scenarios are presented in fig 9 the future qnm7 and qmean used to obtain sfi are presented in the supplementary material fig s3 the current winter low flow appears as a reliable indicator of future summer low flows a catchment with a higher wfi will also have a higher sfi in the future the future sfi stays higher than historic wfi for all catchments but trends are similar between both indicators it means that sfi varies also with the percentage of quaternary deposits of the catchments therefore catchments with a higher percentage of quaternary deposits will probably have a slower decrease in summer low flows relative to the precipitations they receive therefore the percentage of quaternary deposits could be another indicator in addition to the current winter low flows for future summer discharge projections in terms of quantity future groundwater exfiltration accounts for significantly less water a few cm month than current snowmelt more than a hundred mm in a month and thus cannot mitigate the effect of change in snowmelt due to climate change during the current period of snowmelt therefore a strong decrease in summer flows will most probably be observed at the beginning of summer june july thus during future summer low flows the sfi remains higher than wfi for all catchments fig 9 for example a sfi 0 5 1 and 11 means that even under future conditions the low flow is at least half the average flow the sfi is fairly similar between the three scenarios because it represents the hydrogeological characteristics of the catchments however even with a high sfi the decrease in future summer low flows can be significant for water management in terms of absolute quantity we have seen in the previous analysis of seasonal variations of streamflow under climate change that conditions similar to the scenario s3 favour a stronger influence of hydrogeological catchment characteristics on summer low flows fig 7 and fig 8 these conditions are a strong increase in temperature and a decrease in summer precipitation without much increase in winter precipitation in such a climate change scenario and for similar climatic conditions the streamflow of an alpine catchment with a higher percentage of unconsolidated quaternary deposits and therefore higher storage will follow a lower decrease in future summer as illustrated in fig 10 5 limitations groundwater dynamics are highly simplified in the conceptual hydrological model employed here which considers two linear groundwater reservoirs one fast and one slow in high elevation catchments the approach can be justified because during the winter low flow period i e the snow covered period only groundwater is contributing to streamflow in this case the groundwater reservoirs can be considered as linear and recession coefficients can be more easily calibrated santos et al 2017 however in reality alpine aquifers behave in a non linear way owing to their heterogeneity and complex geometry moreover our analysis of geology could be improved by information on the thickness and the hydrogeological characteristics of the different deposits such as alluvium talus or moraine which would also play a role in the storage and the release of groundwater more information about the geology of the catchment is needed to improve this work and to validate the assumption that there is no groundwater flowing under gaging stations this work could be improved with a 3d geological model however the establishment of such a detailed model is very time consuming and often cannot be built with the available information thornton et al 2018 furthermore quaternary deposits have smaller slopes than crystalline rocks and slopes could indirectly affect hydraulic gradients therefore there may be some interplay between slope and the rate of groundwater drainage out of the catchment and it would need more investigation moreover some aquifers with lower permeability than unconsolidated quaternary deposits such as bedrock can control long term discharge dynamics carlier et al 2018 and therefore the responses to climate changes the long term responses to changes are not taken into account in such conceptual models in some geological settings e g extrusive volcanic rocks e g andes and cascades ranges the permeability of the hard rock parts of the alpine system can be much higher than that of the mostly fractured crystalline rocks examined in this study in turn the role of geology in buffering or modifying system response to climate change may be even more profound and requires more investigation therefore hydrogeological modeling in alpine areas should be developed in a physically based manner to better determine the role of groundwater in buffering streamflow regime changes we also assumed that the model calibration is transferable to future climate scenarios which may not entirely be the case in particular into the far future with extreme scenarios moreover only changes in precipitation and temperature are considered the evolution of other parameters such as vegetation cover frozen soils or increase in water needs are not considered it is also important to note that the studied catchments do not contain glaciers or only a small remnant consequently the results may not be comparable to other studies that involve runoff from glacierized catchments 6 conclusions the interplay of snow storage and catchment scale groundwater storage significantly influences how alpine catchments react to ongoing climate warming the main objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the similarities and the differences in low flow behaviour between alpine catchments and to compare the relationship of low flow regimes with catchment geology 2 to determine if groundwater storage can buffer future summer low flows and 3 to establish a link between geology and catchments responses to climate change the analysis was based on 13 selected catchments across the swiss alps with reliable streamflow measurements the analysis was completed in two steps by first comparing well established low flow indicators to surface geology and then simulating past and future streamflow with a simple conceptual hydrological model in which three of the latest extreme rcp8 5 ch2018 climate change scenarios were used the results of the data analysis clearly indicate a relationship between geology and the low flow indicators for the studied swiss catchments catchments with more quaternary deposits are able to provide more water during low flow periods however a larger set of study catchments would be required to statistically validate this relationship between low flow indicators and geology nevertheless these results agree with the recent literature showing the important role of quaternary deposits in storing groundwater in alpine catchments three mechanisms could explain this importance of quaternary deposits i the combination of quaternary deposits with various permeabilities can store enough water to release it slowly during drier years cochand et al 2019b glas et al 2019 hayashi 2020 ii quaternary deposits filling bedrock depressions which act as barriers to flow allows the storage of significant amount of groundwater and iii the high permeability of these water storing deposits facilitate deeper infiltration to layers with lower permeability such as fractured bedrock in fact such deep infiltration is probably less efficient without quaternary deposits especially on steep slopes the dominant role of quaternary aquifers underlines that first order watersheds are elementary units for characterizing alpine hydrogeology their correct conceptualization in numerical models is essential based on these findings we calibrated the hydrological model with a special focus on reproducing low flows the results of our future simulations show the now well known increase of streamflow during winter and decrease of streamflow during summer we clearly show that the annual low flow period starts to shift from winter to summer as simulated future summer low flow is sometimes lower than future winter low flows the impact of snowmelt on summer low flows decreases these changing dynamics are explained by less snow and shorter snow cover periods the results show that in response to the three considered climate change scenarios the mean summer low flows stay at least as high as the current mean winter discharge volume rate the results also highlight that catchments with higher current groundwater contribution to streamflow will have a slower decrease in future summer discharge relative to the precipitation they receive the simulation results also show that the future summer low flow index is correlated to the current winter low flow index which we have shown to be correlated with the percentage of unconsolidated quaternary deposits in the study alpine catchments therefore we propose two indicators which can help to anticipate future summer low flows in alpine areas under climate change as a function of current winter low flows and of the percentage of quaternary deposits future research should however deploy spatially distributed hydrogeological modeling to explicitly consider geology in assessing the role of groundwater for streamflow regime changes in an improved and quantitative way the modelling of both the 3d groundwater dynamic and surface hydrology would be fruitful to improve our conceptual model of hydrogeological processes in alpine catchments such a 3d model requires however a good knowledge about the geology and its hydrodynamic properties which have to be further explored building a 3d geological model is very time consuming thornton et al 2018 therefore a physical hydrogeological with a simplified geology to determine the role of quaternary deposits versus fractured bedrock and slopes could be a next step to improve knowledge in alpine hydrogeological processes and their evolution with climate change this study gives important insights into the evolution of groundwater storage and streamflow under future climate changes in streamflows need to be considered in water management adaptation strategies since shifts to lower flows in summer combined with increased water needs could lead to water shortage the decrease in water volume during summer will reduce water availability during the warm periods for uses such as hydropower irrigation and recreation the increase of streamflow during winter could also be impactful for areas with increased winter water needs for ski tourism finally this study also shows the importance of low flows and therefore the need for good low flow measurements and model calibration for climate change projections which is still not always the case within climate change impact studies in alpine environments as such the role of groundwater and geology should be considered in future

5028,alpine environments are particularly vulnerable to climatic warming and long term observations suggest a shift of snow influenced river discharge towards earlier periods of the year for water resources management the seasonal patterns of discharge in alpine areas are particularly relevant as the shift to lower flows in summer and autumn combined with increased water demand could lead to water shortage in downstream catchments the storage of groundwater in alpine catchments could significantly modulate how changing climatic conditions influence the annual streamflow regime however groundwater storage and its buffering capacity in alpine areas remain poorly understood moreover studies on how climate change will impact water resources in alpine areas rarely consider the influence of geology in this paper catchment geology is used as a basis for the classification of future summer low flows behavior of several alpine catchments in switzerland based on the analysis of the relationship between low flow indicators and geology the role of unconsolidated quaternary deposits is explored we show that quaternary deposits play a critical role in the seasonal storage of groundwater which can contribute to rivers during low flow periods three climate change simulations based on extreme rcp 8 5 scenarios are fed into a conceptual hydrological model to illustrate the buffering role of groundwater past and future low flows normalized by mean past and future streamflows appear correlated with the percentage of unconsolidated quaternary deposits these results highlight that catchments with high groundwater contribution to streamflow relative to precipitation will have a slower decrease in future summer discharge therefore we propose two indicators that can be used to anticipate the response of future summers low flows in alpine areas to climate change the current winter low flows and the percentage of unconsolidated quaternary deposits of the catchments keywords hydrology alpine catchments groundwater storage snow climate change 1 introduction alpine areas greatly affect streamflow dynamics through their seasonal storage of water they are defined as mountainous regions with steep slopes snowmelt dominated located mostly above the tree line where little or no soil and vegetation are present hayashi 2020 during winter water is stored in the form of snow before being released during warmer periods by melt processes thus controlling the seasonal hydrograph freudiger et al 2017 this seasonal redistribution of water can significantly reduce the consequences of meteorological droughts in lowlands during summer beniston and stoffel 2014 rohrer et al 2013 however alpine areas are also highly sensitive to climate change climate change and the associated increasing temperatures result in shorter snow cover durations more precipitation is therefore falling as rain than as snow during the winter period harpold and brooks 2018 li et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 these changes in snowfall fraction will also lead to a decrease in seasonal snow accumulation which can be accentuated by more mid winter melt events cochand et al 2019a pavlovskii et al 2019 consequently winter low flows typical for alpine catchments are expected to become less extreme in magnitude laaha et al 2016 moreover the onset of snowmelt will be shifted toward earlier spring barnett et al 2005 godsey et al 2014 these changes will lead to a lower streamflow peak occurring earlier in the year jenicek et al 2018 and a decrease of spring streamflow barnhart et al 2016 teutschbein et al 2015 these changes will probably also lead to a reduction in stream discharges in summer and autumn barnett et al 2005 berghuijs et al 2014 lauber et al 2014 musselman et al 2017 which can considerably affect water resources management of downstream catchments however hydrological modelling has already shown that snowmelt alone cannot explain the variability of future summer low flows jenicek et al 2016 elevation influences local air temperature and thus changes in snow storage marty et al 2017 showed that in the european alps relative swe could potentially decrease about 50 at high elevations 3 000 m a s l and almost no snow might accumulate at elevations lower than 1 200 m a s l by the end of the century the largest absolute decrease in maximum annual swe was predicted for elevations from 2 000 to 2 700 m a s l jenicek et al 2018 a considerable proportion of hydrological research dedicated to alpine catchments focused on the analysis of alpine stream hydrographs with snowmelt processes during spring and early summer garvelmann et al 2017 jodar et al 2016 lauber et al 2014 staudinger et al 2017 zuecco et al 2018 however hydrological processes that pertain to the subsurface can also be highly relevant groundwater discharge to streams is often the principal component of the streamflow from alpine basins during extended periods of the year especially during winter low flows clow et al 2003 cras et al 2007 hood et al 2006 huth et al 2004 jodar et al 2017 liu et al 2004 to date it remains unclear to what extent groundwater stored in alpine catchments can mitigate the potentially adverse effects of climate change hayashi 2020 viviroli et al 2007 thus there is an urgent need to better understand the capacity of alpine areas to store groundwater as well as the associated dynamics in a recent review paper on the main alpine aquifers across the world hayashi 2020 highlighted the role of aquifers in unconsolidated deposits to explain the fast recession of discharge after the recharge period i e snowmelt or rainfall events followed by a slower recession that sustains discharge over a long period according to hayashi 2020 this two phase recession is likely controlled by groundwater system dynamics spencer et al 2019 showed the importance of both fractured permeable bedrock and glacial till deposits for runoff generation in canada s rocky mountains wirth et al 2020 showed that quaternary deposits are important for groundwater contribution to streamflow in the swiss prealps several recent publications highlighted the role of quaternary deposits to store groundwater in alpine regions christensen et al 2020 arnoux et al 2020 however the linkage between geology groundwater and streamflow regime response to climate change has not previously been addressed explicitly and is the purpose of this paper in addition to the important practical implications of this situation concerning water resources management the scientific understanding of hydrogeological processes in alpine areas remains in its infancy some studies have shown that a change in snow regime affects groundwater recharge tague and grant 2009 and thus impacts streamflow godsey et al 2014 in snow dominated areas the main recharge period occurs during the melt period and there is little recharge during the winter period the total amount of snow precipitation in winter affects groundwater recharge and hence streamflow during dry summer periods beaulieu et al 2012 van loon et al 2015 however the link between groundwater storage and streamflow regime changes is difficult to determine in this context the main objectives of this study are 1 to determine if and how current low flow rates are related to the geology of alpine catchments 2 to discuss the consequences of climate change for future winter and summer low flows and evaluate the influence of dynamic groundwater storage on flow rates 3 to establish the link between geology and catchment response to climate change for this purpose we have selected 13 catchments across the swiss alps we first compared their low flow characteristics with the surface geology to classify them subsequently past and future streamflow dynamics were simulated using the conceptual hydrological hbv model seibert 2000 we focused on groundwater contribution to streamflows and its impact on summer low flows to better represent the streamflow and groundwater dynamics we consider the seasonal and inter annual variability in streamflow and groundwater storage by running three of the latest simulations of the extreme rcp8 5 ch2018 climate change scenario continuously from the past starting 1981 until the end of this century ending 2099 2 study sites thirteen gauged alpine catchments were selected across the swiss alps their surface areas range from 8 1 to 55 3 km2 allowing a relation between groundwater storage and specific catchment characteristics their mean elevations range from 1 702 to 2 567 m asl high enough to be considered as alpine catchments but also without or only very small areas covered by glaciers they were also selected as they are nearly undisturbed by man made infrastructure dams pumping etc three exceptions can be indicated catchment 1 for which a known volume of water is pumped for drinking water and 4 and 5 which can have various minor influences i e low volume of pumping or water transfer the location of the chosen catchments is illustrated in fig 1 and their main characteristics are described in table 1 fig 2 illustrates the distribution of elevation versus slopes these catchments are all snow melt dominated with a snow cover period of a few months a snow accumulation period between 5 and 7 months and a snowmelt period of 2 to 3 months based on 2016 2018 snow data see part 3 1 for the description of snow data catchments with the strongest snow accumulation are 6 2 9 1 and the ones with the lowest accumulation rates are 10 and 8 catchment 1 has been monitored for a few years and its hydrogeology has already been studied see cochand et al 2019b for more details catchments 3 to 13 are part of the swiss hydrological network hug and some of them have been considered in previous studies focusing on future climate impacts or low flows analyses addor et al 2014 jenicek et al 2018 2016 staudinger and seibert 2014 staudinger et al 2017 2015 but without specifically focusing on the role of groundwater and geology in catchment dynamics which is the purpose of this paper the geology of the catchments has been extracted from the surface geological maps 1 25 000 from swisstopo 2018 in this paper we focus on the role of deposits common for each catchment which are the quaternary deposits these deposits are mainly talus moraine alluvium or cones the permeability of quaternary deposits can be variable but the rocks are characterized by relatively high porosity and permeability for example in the canadian rockies muir et al 2011 observed that talus has a very high hydraulic conductivity 0 01 to 0 03 m s and limited storage capacity with sometimes a residence time scale of less than a week conversely moraines have been regularly observed to have lower hydraulic conductivities in the approximate ranges of 10 6 to 10 4 m s for lateral moraines and 10 5 to 10 4 m s for frontal moraines vincent et al 2019 they are mostly composed of clays silts sands and gravels where the sands and gravels can be many orders of magnitude higher in permeability compared to the fractured crystalline rocks there is no information available on the depths of these deposits for the study catchment except catchment 12 and 1 for catchment 12 the estimated average is in the range of 0 5 10 m floriancic et al 2018 for catchment 1 a geophysical study has estimated alluvium sediment to be at a maximum 38 m depth in the valley bottom geotest 1963 in the literature the thickness of quaternary sediments has been estimated to be up to 30 40 m in the meadow christensen et al 2020 the thickness of the moraine has been estimated to be up to 16 30 m in the canadian rockies langston et al 2011 hayashi 2020 acknowledge that the total thickness of alpine sediments such as talus may not be the controlling parameter of groundwater storage but rather the bedrock topography underneath the deposits as the depth of quaternary sediments is not available for all studied catchments the percentage of quaternary cover the surface of quaternary deposits divided by the catchment surface is used as a metric to compare low flows indicators to this specific type of geology 3 methods the alpine catchments are firstly classified based on their geology and on their capacity to store water derived from a set of low flow indicators section 3 4 then based on historical data the discharges are simulated with a conceptual hydrological model which is calibrated to fit historical streamflow data with a focus on winter low flows section 3 3 finally we apply climate change projections section 3 2 to the calibrated models to determine the role of groundwater in buffering future streamflow regime changes 3 1 data collection and processing daily gridded precipitation and 2 m high air temperature data 2 km resolution from 1961 to 2018 are provided by the swiss federal office of meteorology and climatology ch2018 2018a an area averaged time series of precipitation and air temperature is obtained for each catchment by averaging at each time step the values of all grid cells normalized by the area of the cells contained in the catchment between 2 and 11 grid cells per catchment daily discharge data were obtained from gauging stations monitored by the swiss federal office for the environment ofev catchments 3 to 13 by the canton of ticino 2 and by the university of neuchâtel 1 the availability period of the monitored streamflow data for each catchment is summarised in table 1 based on the analysis of the geology underlying the gauging stations we assume that groundwater flowing below gauging stations i e bypassing them is negligible table 1 mean daily snow water equivalent swe data were available for three years and for each catchment period 01 09 2015 31 08 2018 these data were based on daily snow depth observations from over 300 swiss snow monitoring stations the observations were assimilated into a physically based snowpack model run at 250 m spatial and hourly temporal resolution which were then upscaled to one average swe value per catchment and per day details about monitoring data snowpack modeling and data assimilation methods are available from griessinger et al 2019 and winstral et al 2019 these daily mean swe data are used here to calibrate the snow routine of the hbv model see section 3 3 3 the dominant geology per catchment is derived from the swiss geological map 1 25 000 swisstopo 2018 topographic watershed and slopes are obtained using the digital elevation model at 25 m swisstopo 2008 on arcgis software 10 4 1 3 2 climate projections the recent swiss climate change scenarios 2018 data set ch2018 2018a is used to simulate the impact of future changes in air temperature and precipitation on dynamic groundwater storage in alpine catchments and its influence on stream discharge the ch2018 data set is based on global climate modeling combined with downscaling using regional climate models and quantile mapping ch2018 2018b the data set consists of daily gridded air temperature and precipitation from 1981 to 2099 at a resolution of 2 km catchment average time series of daily precipitation and air temperature are obtained by averaging all grid cells normalized by the area of the cells contained in the catchment between 2 and 11 grid cells per catchment it is important to note that the climate data may not replicate the reality because of the difficulty in accurately determining temperature and precipitation in highly heterogeneous environments such as alpine areas besides a resolution of 2 km is higher than what would be necessary for the size of our study catchments these sources of uncertainty are acceptable for our study as the aim is to determine the sensitivity of the catchments to changes also focusing our analysis on relative differences between a reference period and future climate change impact simulations reduces the uncertainty linked to systematic biases following the recommendations of the ch2018 report ch2018 2018a 30 year means are compared a reference period ref 1982 2011 is compared to three future periods 2035 2020 2049 2060 2045 2074 and 2085 2070 2099 three climate change model chains are selected because of their spring temperature evolutions in the two regions chaw and chae where most of the study catchments are located fig 1 we selected rcp 8 5 scenarios to cover the greatest impact on the hydrological cycle in addition we selected projections with a strong increase in spring temperature to explicitly study the effect of groundwater on future summer low flows high spring temperature affects snowmelt the most and therefore groundwater recharge during the snowmelt period the three chosen model chains have also different seasonal evolutions of precipitation as summarized in table 2 scenario s1 has the highest increase in spring temperature s3 follows a high increase in winter and spring temperature along with a strong decrease in summer precipitation and s2 is between both with a lower increase in winter and spring temperatures than s1 and a lower decrease in summer precipitations than s3 3 3 model 3 3 1 description the hbv model bergström 1995 lindström et al 1997 is a bucket type model in this study hbv light is used seibert and vis 2012 this model uses different model routines to simulate catchment scale discharge based on time series of daily precipitation and air temperature as well as estimates of daily potential evapotranspiration a detailed description of the model can be found in the work of bergström 1995 lindström et al 1997 and seibert 2000 the model consists of four model routines to simulate catchment runoff 1 the snow routine snow accumulation and melt are computed by a degree day method 2 the soil routine where infiltration to the upper groundwater box and actual evapotranspiration are simulated as functions of the water storage in the soil box 3 the response routine where runoff is computed as a function of water storage in an upper fast and a lower slow groundwater reservoir and 4 the routing routine where a triangular weighting function routes the runoff to the outlet of the catchment routines 2 to 4 are run here in a lumped mode for the entire catchment the snow routine is run based on a set of elevation bands see section 3 3 3 the corresponding simulated snow melt is then averaged at catchment scale and together with liquid rainfall fed into routines 2 to 4 this conceptual model is based on the following assumptions 1 there is no other inflow into the stream except flows generated by the above routines and 2 aquifers respond as linear reservoirs the groundwater storage is the sum of water contained in the two upper and lower groundwater boxes li et al 2015 potential evapotranspiration is calculated with oudin s formula based on latitude and daily air temperature oudin et al 2005 actual evapotranspiration is then computed by reducing the potential evapotranspiration as a function of soil water deficit seibert and vis 2012 the sensitivity and uncertainty of the model parameters of the hbv model have been widely studied in sweden and norway bergström 1976 mapped the mean square error function of streamflow by the trial and error method seibert 1997 found that the sensitivity was hard to be described quantitatively since the sensitivity changes greatly with different parameter values for snowmelt dominated catchments the main uncertainties come from snow parameters mainly the threshold air temperature for snow accumulation and snowmelt and the degree day factor and the recession coefficients of both groundwater boxes li et al 2015 compared to the original hbv model the version hbv light used here has a warming up period one year is used in our case with no limitation for the routing parameter see seibert and vis 2012 for detailed information 3 3 2 model calibration and validation model calibration and validation are done in three steps 1 snow parameters are calibrated independently on the three years of available swe data 2015 2018 2 hydrological parameters are then calibrated on the entire period of measurements until 2015 and finally 3 the joint performance of all model parameters are validated on the last three years of measurements 2015 2018 simulations are run for nine catchments 1 3 6 7 9 10 11 12 13 the four other catchments 8 5 2 and 4 are not considered in the simulations the main reasons for this choice are short time series and lack in streamflow measurements 2 and 8 or anthropogenic influences such as water abstraction on the streamflow 4 and 5 these last four catchments are therefore not presented in the results based on simulations see part 4 3 3 2 1 snow parameters calibration catchments were divided into elevation zones from 6 to 11 zones depending on their elevation ranges see table 1 the elevation ranges are not used for the generation of streamflow but they allow the calibration of both precipitation and air temperature gradients for future periods the gradients are kept constant these two gradients and the snow routine parameters threshold temperature degree day factor seasonal variability in degree day factor were first calibrated to reproduce daily swe data c f section 3 1 from september 1 2015 to august 31 2018 as only one threshold parameter for snow accumulation and melt is implemented in the hbv model snow routine it was included as part of the calibration this first step of the calibration is conducted for each catchment using the genetic calibration algorithm gab of hbv by which optimized parameter sets are found by consecutive evolution of parameter sets using selection and recombination seibert and vis 2012 the objective function for this optimization is obtained following an integrated multivariable model calibration procedure seibert 2000 where a combination of two criteria is defined as the objective function these criteria are the model efficiency for swe nseswe nash sutcliffe 1970 and the mean absolute normalized error for swe mneswe expressed as follows 1 n s e s w e 1 h obs h sim 2 h obs h obs 2 2 m n e s w e 1 h obs h sim h obs where hobs and hsim are the observed and the simulated snow water equivalent the objective function is a combination of these two criteria giving the same weights to each of them the aim was to reproduce the current snow accumulation and melt in order to get reliable future simulations the model was validated using data from 2015 to 2018 snow conditions did not change significantly during this period different calibration trials might result in different parameter sets with similar model performances during calibration but different behavior during other periods to better address this parameter uncertainty the model was calibrated 10 times starting each time from different initial parameter sets and resulting in 10 best parameter sets for the search range of the snow parameters see table s1 in the supplementary material these 10 sets were then used to simulate 10 different time series for all simulation periods most of the further analyses were then based on these 10 series for both reference and future periods additionally during snow parameter calibration a check was made to ensure no unrealistic snow accumulation series were modelled as already observed with the hbv snow routine in the past jenicek et al 2018 for this step any simulation resulting in multi year snow accumulation snow tower building up freudiger et al 2017 is assumed to be unrealistic if it was the case the initial search ranges for the snow parameters were arbitrarily reduced within their range of variation to avoid this artifact the nse coefficient varies between and 1 with a value of 1 representing a perfect reproduction of the time series and a negative value indicating that the model performs worse than the simplest possible model which is taking the average observed value as a model it is important to point out here that this nse value if computed on strongly seasonal signals needs to result in very high values to indicate good model performance schaefli and gupta 2007 this explains the very high nseswe values 0 90 obtained for all case studies table 3 3 3 2 2 soil and groundwater parameter calibration in a second step the model is calibrated to reproduce observed streamflow from the beginning of the monitoring period see table 1 for monitoring period per catchment until 31 august 2015 as the last three years of measurements 2015 2018 are used for validation see below all parameters except the snow ones are calibrated using the inverse automatic calibration software pest doherty 2005 pest is a model independent non linear parameter estimation and optimization package it reads files of input parameters and target outputs the algorithms are based on the implementation of the gauss marquardt levenberg algorithm to allow a fast and efficient convergence towards the best value of the objective function it is the minimum of a weighted least square sum of the difference between simulated and observed discharge calibration is conducted to reproduce streamflow with a specific interest in low flows using the following objective function ф 3 ϕ i 1 n q i obs q i sim w i 2 where q i obs and q i sim are the observed and simulated catchment streamflow rates and wi is the weight associated with the streamflow value at the time step i accordingly higher weights are used on low flows see supplementary material table s3 for weights pest approaches an optimized parameter set within the specified ranges of the parameters doherty and johnston 2003 the optimization algorithm is run once for each of the ten best snow parameter sets identified in the previous set resulting in a total of ten optimized parameter sets per catchment because it is a non unique problem different initial parameters are used to avoid the stay in the local minima of the objective function these ten parameter sets were considered as representative of catchment variability in response to extreme climate change scenarios because the variability of parameters and especially recession coefficients are well constrained by the higher weight on winter low flows during a long period of time to assess the quality of the calibration the mean flow rate volumetric error mneq the nash sutcliffe efficiency for discharge nseq and for log q nselnq between observed and simulated streamflow are calculated on the calibration period and on a three years validation period 2015 2018 they are expressed as follows 4 n s e q 1 i 1 n q i obs q i sim 2 i 1 n q i obs q obs 2 5 n s e l n q 1 i 1 n l n q i obs l n q i sim 2 i 1 n lnq i obs lnq obs 2 6 m n e q 1 i 1 n q i obs q i sim i 1 n q i obs where q i obs and q i sim are the observed and simulated catchment streamflow rates at the time step i these three indicators eqs 4 5 and 6 are not used as objective functions but are rather calculated to evaluate the quality of the calibration performed with pest 1 the mean performance of the ten model runs with the optimized parameter sets are presented in table 4 and table 5 for the calibration and the validation period the three coefficients indicate good overall model performances for both periods even with a higher weight on low flows in the objective function as the model simulates satisfactory both high and low streamflow i e values nseq nselnq and mneq between 0 5 and 1 3 4 low flow indicators low flow indicators are used to compare the catchments regarding their potential to store groundwater the q95 q50 discharge exceeded 95 of the time divided by median discharge ratio has already been used in low flows studies in swiss catchments carlier et al 2018 2019 these authors showed that large dynamic groundwater storage ensures high groundwater contribution during low flows and high q95 q50 ratios in alpine catchments as the winter low flow period is long compared to the low flow period of catchments with more rainfall driven hydrological regimes from 4 to 9 months for our studied catchments depending on the snow cover duration the winter flow index wfi is often used cochand et al 2019b hayashi 2020 paznekas and hayashi 2015 these authors have shown that wfi can reflect the groundwater contribution to streamflow a higher wfi indicating more groundwater contribution cochand et al 2019b paznekas and hayashi 2015 it is here obtained as follows 7 wfi q n m 7 q mean where qnm7 is the minimum discharge over seven consecutive days during the winter period from november to june and qmean is the mean annual discharge we follow the definition from the paper of cochand et al 2019b it is important to note that this study used a slightly different definition of the wfi paznekas and hayashi 2015 used the specific average flow for january and february while cochand et al 2019b used the minimum discharge over seven consecutive days this latter definition is considered to be more appropriate given the variability of the studied catchments and to be able to compare them between each other for many of the catchments the low flow period varies from february to june similarly to wfi the summer low flow index sfi is calculated with the qnm7 in the summer months from july to september besides as the main period of groundwater storage increase is during snowmelt we decided to use also the obtained dynamic groundwater storage dgs divided by the mean maximum snow water equivalent dgs swemax as an indicator of groundwater contribution to streamflow for alpine catchments this dgs is calculated from the model simulations and is the difference between the minimum and maximum groundwater level in the two combined groundwater reservoirs described above upper and lower these water levels computed by the model are not calibrated with or compared to measured groundwater levels there are no piezometers in most of the study catchments moreover the groundwater boxes of the model do not represent a specific aquifer and cannot be compared to a point measurement such as water level in a piezometer two different dgs components are defined dgsn during the recharge period from low to high level and dgsn 1 during the recession period from high to low level they are expressed as follows 8 dg s n h n h n 9 dg s n 1 h n h n 1 where hn is the maximum groundwater level in the combined upper and lower groundwater reservoirs see section 3 3 1 of the year n hn is the minimum of the same year n and hn 1 is the minimum of the following year the mean dgs is the mean of both dgsn and dgsn 1 dgs and swemax used in the index are both mean values calculated over the entire period of simulation based on historical data calibration and validation periods dgs swemax varies between 0 3 and 0 8 for our catchments a dgs swemax close to 1 means that the majority of snowmelt contributes to groundwater storage the low flow indicators presented here are summarized in table 6 4 results and discussion in the following we first compare the low flow characteristics of all selected catchments with the surface geology then we analyze the evolution of discharge in response to climate change scenarios in this part we focus on relative changes between the reference period and the future periods rather than absolute changes in simulated discharge to be able to compare the catchments between each other 4 1 relationship between low flow behavior and geology 4 1 1 low flow indicators the low flow indicators q95 q50 wfi and dgs swemax are strongly positively correlated fig 3 and detailed values in the supplementary material table s4 i e if the dgs swemax increases the wfi fig 3 and the q95 q50 not shown increase this relationship confirmes the previous findings see section 3 4 that catchments with high wfi q95 q50 and dgs swemax are those catchments that have a high groundwater contribution to streamflow relative to the amount of precipitation they receive given the strong correlation of the two low flow indicators based on historical data q95 q50 and wfi fig 3a we only consider wfi in the rest of the study the correlation between the data based wfi and the model based dgs swemax is expected because an important flow rate after a prolonged winter recession requires a high dynamic groundwater storage in the model this nevertheless gives confidence in the dgs swemax indicator which is based on a simple hydrological model albeit calibrated with a special focus on low flows the range of variation of wfi is surprisingly high given that they are all alpine catchments with snow dominated hydrological streamflow regimes but without significant glacier cover it varies between 0 08 for 8 and 10 and 0 34 for 11 fig 3 based on these values three clusters of similar values can be defined catchments 11 1 12 and 2 have a high groundwater storage potential 0 25 wfi 0 35 catchments 3 4 13 5 6 a medium 0 15 wfi 0 25 and catchments 7 10 9 and 8 a low 0 wfi 0 15 in the literature wfi varies between 0 05 and 0 28 for large alpine catchments drainage areas 250 km2 hayashi 2020 and between 0 28 and 0 10 for some swiss alpine catchments cochand et al 2019b 4 1 2 low flow indicators and geology both wfi and dgs swemax are positively correlated with the relative amount of quaternary deposits fig 4 hence the results highlight the importance of unconsolidated quaternary deposits such as moraines alluvium and talus in storing groundwater these deposits are typical for alpine areas this result gives evidence for the fact that in the swiss alps the seasonal groundwater storage is strongly influenced by the local geology even if more catchments would be required to statistically validate this relationship other groundwater systems such as karstic or fractured bedrock systems can also jointly interact with quaternary deposits to store groundwater for example for catchment 1 an evaporitic zone and quaternary deposits contribute significantly to winter low flows cochand et al 2019b for catchment 12 weathered bedrock and quaternary deposits contribute significantly to winter low flows floriancic et al 2018 this could explain why it plots toward higher wfi in fig 4a the recent literature review of hayashi 2020 highlights the important role of quaternary deposits in storing groundwater in alpine regions it has been shown that groundwater storage can be controlled by the combination of quaternary deposits for example talus and meadow in the andean mountains glas et al 2019 or talus and moraine in the swiss alps cochand et al 2019b in a recent review hayashi 2020 hypothesized that groundwater storage in alpine areas is probably controlled by the combination of bedrock topography covered by quaternary deposits or by the permeability variation inside moraines and talus we suggest that another reason explaining the importance of unconsolidated deposits is that they prevent fast runoff of melt and rainwater thus maintaining groundwater recharge irrespectively of the aquifer type that is responsible for groundwater storage this mechanism could be particularly important for recharge of fractured bedrocks which often feature limited infiltration capacity thus normally favoring runoff however it is important to note that the surface slopes could indirectly affect subsurface and surface hydraulic gradients and hence the rates at which the water is drained out of the system the mean slope and the percentage of quaternary deposits are both intrinsically linked the mean slope increases when the percentage of quaternary deposits decreases and the role of slope cannot be distinctly explored see fig s4 in supplementary material following the discussion concerning the role of unconsolidated quaternary deposits in storing groundwater their hydrologic response to climate change is further explored and associate with geological conditions and storage dynamics 4 1 3 streamflow with past meteorological conditions 1968 2017 meteorological changes from 1968 to 2018 are as follows data not shown mean annual precipitation stays constant the temperature increases evaporation increases but stays small mean et from 170 to 300 mm yr depending on the catchments observed historical streamflow data and corresponding swe data are presented for some of the catchments to determine whether relevant changes in seasonal streamflow can already be observed in response to the increase in air temperature during recent decades fig 5 the changes in observed discharge are compared with changes in simulated swe on two 30 year mean periods for the catchments with a long period of streamflow monitoring fig 5 the results of the simulations show a decrease in mean simulated swe for all catchments fig 5 b maximum swe on a 30 year average follows a decrease for all catchments ranging from approx 65 mm to 140 mm in may 11 or june 13 7 3 over the 1988 2017 period compared to the 1968 1999 period fig 5 b as shown in fig 5a the streamflow increases in may and decreases in july because snowmelt starts and finishes earlier in the year thereafter streamflow decreases in the summer months from july to september or to october and increases for the rest of the year overall the mean annual streamflow remains constant throughout the years except a slightly positive annual trend for catchment 7 4 2 discharge evolution with climate change in the following the annual and seasonal evolutions of discharge under climate change scenarios and the factors influencing it are described and discussed the aim is to link the discharge regime evolution in response to climate change and groundwater storage and therefore geology 4 2 1 mean annual changes as expected all catchments are affected by a decrease in snow water equivalent in the future periods for the three scenarios due to the increase of air temperature during spring and winter both the reduction of snow cover duration and the rise in the air temperature increase the potential evapotranspiration the simulated actual evapotranspiration increases from 150 mm year for the reference period from 1982 to 2011 to 200 mm year by the 2085 period for the studied catchments data not shown future evapotranspiration represents for some catchments twice the actual evapotranspiration in the reference period ex catchment 6 from 200 to 400 mm yr by the end of the century with s3 fig 6 d however the calculated evapotranspiration is limited regarding the increase in air temperatures because of shallow soils in alpine areas not taking into account the depth of soils in alpine areas the annual evapotranspiration remains limited but can still become an important factor in the annual water budget in alpine areas in the future in fig 6 the results of the parameters for the simulation of six catchments for s3 are shown the catchment selection is based on their wfi values the selected catchments have wfi values covering the full range of variation from 0 08 10 to 0 34 11 with 1 3 6 and 7 between the response of the mean annual streamflow to climate change varies for different scenarios and catchments all catchments show a decreasing trend in mean annual streamflow by the 2085 period this decrease ranges from approx 150 mm yr for catchments 11 and 3 to 400 mm yr for catchments 6 and 10 it represents a streamflow decrease by 20 for 6 and 30 for 10 and 11 these changes can be mainly explained by a decrease in precipitation fig 6 a affecting all catchments for the 2085 period maximum decrease of 16 5 in mean for 10 except catchments 3 and 11 which show an increase in annual precipitation 1 4 and 0 9 in mean for 3 and 11 respectively a further explanation for streamflow reduction is the continuous increase in evapotranspiration as it is the case for 11 and 3 groundwater storage shows similar variations as streamflow with a slight decrease for the 2085 period from 10 to 20 in mean except for catchments 3 and 6 for which mean groundwater storage increases by 10 to 15 for the 2085 period respectively fig 6 e to explain these annual variations it is necessary to analyze the seasonal variations of groundwater storage and streamflow with scenarios s1 and s2 mean annual streamflow and groundwater storage do not show significant trends or follow a slight increase for the 2085 period compared to the reference period data not shown 4 2 2 mean seasonal variations the seasonal variations are compared between the reference and the 2085 period future precipitation patterns between the three scenarios s1 s3 are as follows for s1 mean seasonal precipitation stays relatively constant except for catchments 3 and 11 where they slightly increase in summer for s2 precipitation increases in winter and slightly decreases in summer except for catchments 3 and 11 where precipitation stays constant in summer and for s3 precipitation stays relatively constant during winter and decreases in summer detailed plots available in supplementary material fig s2 the simulated evapotranspiration increases mainly during spring due to earlier snowmelt and higher temperatures combined with high water availability in the soil see fig s2 future simulated evapotranspiration ranging from few mm month to 120 mm month in the 2085 period can significantly reduce water availability for streamflow in summer the simulated swemax is lower and appears 1 to 2 months earlier for all catchments and scenarios fig s2 in response streamflow peaks and the main recharge period occur 1 to 2 months earlier and the maximum streamflow decreases the simulated groundwater storage increases in winter because of a shorter mean snow cover period and therefore a longer period for recharge for scenario s3 the mean groundwater storage decreases in summer for the 2085 period for most of the catchments for scenarios s1 and s2 the summer groundwater storage increases for catchments 6 9 11 3 13 or decreases catchments 1 7 12 and 10 fig s2 this increase is due to the melt recharge during winter and spring and partly due to an increase in summer precipitation for example for catchments 3 and 11 with s1 the groundwater minimum tends to shift from winter to summer for the 2085 period the differences in scenarios s3 s2 s1 highlight the fact that groundwater storage also depends on spatial precipitation patterns to summarize for all scenarios and catchments for the 2085 period relative to the reference period the differences in groundwater storage are the following 1 a lower decrease in winter 2 a lower and earlier recharge during the melt period 3 a more pronounced decrease in summer and 4 a higher increase in autumn due to more liquid precipitation based on the simulations the fraction of streamflow originating from snowmelt to total streamflow in june and july decreases for the 2085 period and almost completely disappears at the lowest elevations for example catchment 10 as mentioned earlier the climate change scenarios selected for this study represent a strong warming trend and therefore entail a strong reduction in snowmelt however the evolution of snowmelt and corresponding streamflow generation is still in agreement with what has already been shown in previous studies e g jenicek et al 2018 consequently the impact of snowmelt on streamflow in alpine catchments will not be discussed in detail in this paper the decrease in summer streamflow is mainly influenced by the shift of the timing of snowmelt for example a decrease of 90 of streamflow in july and 80 in august is observed for 6 with s3 fig 7 h the future summer streamflow depends on previous hydrological conditions precipitation patterns evapotranspiration and groundwater contribution for all scenarios and for all catchments streamflow increases in winter december to february ranging from a few mm month to around 100 mm month in january february subsequently for almost all catchments streamflow decreases in summer from a few mm month to around 50 mm month in august september fig s2 furthermore snowmelt precipitation and groundwater maintain summer low flows higher than historic winter low flows current winter low flows therefore appear to form a lower bound for future summer low flows as the mean future summer low flows stay above the current mean winter low flows moreover the low flow period starts to shift from winter to summer in fig 7 the discharges of four catchments are presented the selection is based on their wfi range from 0 15 to 0 34 and is also based on the availability of a gauging station above 1300 m a s l furthermore these catchments are interesting because they will continue to show a snowmelt dominated regime even with the considered climate change scenarios the other catchments are presented in the supplementary material fig s2 the differences in catchment responses in summer low flows due to their hydrogeological characteristics become more apparent for s3 than for s2 fig 7 or for s1 fig s2a indeed in this scenario the high flows are smaller and the recession durations are longer fig 7 this is due to an earlier snowmelt peak because of higher temperatures in spring and no increase in summer precipitations table 2 and fig s2c in fig 8 the seasonal difference between reference and the 2085 period δq δswe and δ p et of catchments 11 and 3 for scenarios s1 s2 and s3 are presented these two catchments are discussed in more detail because they are both located close to each other in the east part of switzerland at similar altitudes with similar changes in p t and et for streamflow the variations of 3 are higher than for 11 whereas variations of swe fig 8b and e and p et fig 8c and f are similar for these two catchments in future scenarios the changes in simulated streamflow in august can be described as follows for s1 a decrease of 10 7 mm month for 3 fig 8a and an increase of 11 5 mm month for 11 fig 8b for s2 a decrease of 43 30 mm month for 3 fig 8a and fig 7b and almost no change for 11 fig 8b and fig 7a for s3 a decrease of 45 29 mm month for 3 fig 8a and fig 7f and of 29 13 mm month for 11 fig 8b and fig 7e these differences between 3 and 11 behaviors can be explained by the differences in groundwater storage and thus in geology facing a similar climatic evolution catchment 11 has a slower decrease in discharge because of the buffer effect of groundwater it is therefore able to maintain a similar quantity of water for a longer time without water input from rain or snowmelt it is therefore less sensitive to climate change as its changes in high or low flows are smoother than a catchment with lower groundwater storage potential as catchment 3 in similar climate change conditions however it is important to note that we refer to relative changes and not to the absolute quantity of water available in the river which can also be relevant for water management besides if a catchment is located in an area with an increase in precipitation during summer these differences cannot be identified 4 2 3 predictions of future summer low flows and geology given the importance of future low water periods in alpine areas we provide some useful elements to better predict their future dynamics we have shown that even in the far future summer low flows are not as extreme as current winter low flows in alpine catchments because their duration is shorter between 2 and 4 months and recharge by precipitation occurs in the studied catchments streamflow is provided for 4 to 9 months without precipitation input as shown by historically measured streamflows therefore the current winter low flow constitutes a lower bound for the future summer low flow the comparisons between wfi based on historical data and future 2085 sfi mean on 30 years on the 2085 period for the three scenarios are presented in fig 9 the future qnm7 and qmean used to obtain sfi are presented in the supplementary material fig s3 the current winter low flow appears as a reliable indicator of future summer low flows a catchment with a higher wfi will also have a higher sfi in the future the future sfi stays higher than historic wfi for all catchments but trends are similar between both indicators it means that sfi varies also with the percentage of quaternary deposits of the catchments therefore catchments with a higher percentage of quaternary deposits will probably have a slower decrease in summer low flows relative to the precipitations they receive therefore the percentage of quaternary deposits could be another indicator in addition to the current winter low flows for future summer discharge projections in terms of quantity future groundwater exfiltration accounts for significantly less water a few cm month than current snowmelt more than a hundred mm in a month and thus cannot mitigate the effect of change in snowmelt due to climate change during the current period of snowmelt therefore a strong decrease in summer flows will most probably be observed at the beginning of summer june july thus during future summer low flows the sfi remains higher than wfi for all catchments fig 9 for example a sfi 0 5 1 and 11 means that even under future conditions the low flow is at least half the average flow the sfi is fairly similar between the three scenarios because it represents the hydrogeological characteristics of the catchments however even with a high sfi the decrease in future summer low flows can be significant for water management in terms of absolute quantity we have seen in the previous analysis of seasonal variations of streamflow under climate change that conditions similar to the scenario s3 favour a stronger influence of hydrogeological catchment characteristics on summer low flows fig 7 and fig 8 these conditions are a strong increase in temperature and a decrease in summer precipitation without much increase in winter precipitation in such a climate change scenario and for similar climatic conditions the streamflow of an alpine catchment with a higher percentage of unconsolidated quaternary deposits and therefore higher storage will follow a lower decrease in future summer as illustrated in fig 10 5 limitations groundwater dynamics are highly simplified in the conceptual hydrological model employed here which considers two linear groundwater reservoirs one fast and one slow in high elevation catchments the approach can be justified because during the winter low flow period i e the snow covered period only groundwater is contributing to streamflow in this case the groundwater reservoirs can be considered as linear and recession coefficients can be more easily calibrated santos et al 2017 however in reality alpine aquifers behave in a non linear way owing to their heterogeneity and complex geometry moreover our analysis of geology could be improved by information on the thickness and the hydrogeological characteristics of the different deposits such as alluvium talus or moraine which would also play a role in the storage and the release of groundwater more information about the geology of the catchment is needed to improve this work and to validate the assumption that there is no groundwater flowing under gaging stations this work could be improved with a 3d geological model however the establishment of such a detailed model is very time consuming and often cannot be built with the available information thornton et al 2018 furthermore quaternary deposits have smaller slopes than crystalline rocks and slopes could indirectly affect hydraulic gradients therefore there may be some interplay between slope and the rate of groundwater drainage out of the catchment and it would need more investigation moreover some aquifers with lower permeability than unconsolidated quaternary deposits such as bedrock can control long term discharge dynamics carlier et al 2018 and therefore the responses to climate changes the long term responses to changes are not taken into account in such conceptual models in some geological settings e g extrusive volcanic rocks e g andes and cascades ranges the permeability of the hard rock parts of the alpine system can be much higher than that of the mostly fractured crystalline rocks examined in this study in turn the role of geology in buffering or modifying system response to climate change may be even more profound and requires more investigation therefore hydrogeological modeling in alpine areas should be developed in a physically based manner to better determine the role of groundwater in buffering streamflow regime changes we also assumed that the model calibration is transferable to future climate scenarios which may not entirely be the case in particular into the far future with extreme scenarios moreover only changes in precipitation and temperature are considered the evolution of other parameters such as vegetation cover frozen soils or increase in water needs are not considered it is also important to note that the studied catchments do not contain glaciers or only a small remnant consequently the results may not be comparable to other studies that involve runoff from glacierized catchments 6 conclusions the interplay of snow storage and catchment scale groundwater storage significantly influences how alpine catchments react to ongoing climate warming the main objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the similarities and the differences in low flow behaviour between alpine catchments and to compare the relationship of low flow regimes with catchment geology 2 to determine if groundwater storage can buffer future summer low flows and 3 to establish a link between geology and catchments responses to climate change the analysis was based on 13 selected catchments across the swiss alps with reliable streamflow measurements the analysis was completed in two steps by first comparing well established low flow indicators to surface geology and then simulating past and future streamflow with a simple conceptual hydrological model in which three of the latest extreme rcp8 5 ch2018 climate change scenarios were used the results of the data analysis clearly indicate a relationship between geology and the low flow indicators for the studied swiss catchments catchments with more quaternary deposits are able to provide more water during low flow periods however a larger set of study catchments would be required to statistically validate this relationship between low flow indicators and geology nevertheless these results agree with the recent literature showing the important role of quaternary deposits in storing groundwater in alpine catchments three mechanisms could explain this importance of quaternary deposits i the combination of quaternary deposits with various permeabilities can store enough water to release it slowly during drier years cochand et al 2019b glas et al 2019 hayashi 2020 ii quaternary deposits filling bedrock depressions which act as barriers to flow allows the storage of significant amount of groundwater and iii the high permeability of these water storing deposits facilitate deeper infiltration to layers with lower permeability such as fractured bedrock in fact such deep infiltration is probably less efficient without quaternary deposits especially on steep slopes the dominant role of quaternary aquifers underlines that first order watersheds are elementary units for characterizing alpine hydrogeology their correct conceptualization in numerical models is essential based on these findings we calibrated the hydrological model with a special focus on reproducing low flows the results of our future simulations show the now well known increase of streamflow during winter and decrease of streamflow during summer we clearly show that the annual low flow period starts to shift from winter to summer as simulated future summer low flow is sometimes lower than future winter low flows the impact of snowmelt on summer low flows decreases these changing dynamics are explained by less snow and shorter snow cover periods the results show that in response to the three considered climate change scenarios the mean summer low flows stay at least as high as the current mean winter discharge volume rate the results also highlight that catchments with higher current groundwater contribution to streamflow will have a slower decrease in future summer discharge relative to the precipitation they receive the simulation results also show that the future summer low flow index is correlated to the current winter low flow index which we have shown to be correlated with the percentage of unconsolidated quaternary deposits in the study alpine catchments therefore we propose two indicators which can help to anticipate future summer low flows in alpine areas under climate change as a function of current winter low flows and of the percentage of quaternary deposits future research should however deploy spatially distributed hydrogeological modeling to explicitly consider geology in assessing the role of groundwater for streamflow regime changes in an improved and quantitative way the modelling of both the 3d groundwater dynamic and surface hydrology would be fruitful to improve our conceptual model of hydrogeological processes in alpine catchments such a 3d model requires however a good knowledge about the geology and its hydrodynamic properties which have to be further explored building a 3d geological model is very time consuming thornton et al 2018 therefore a physical hydrogeological with a simplified geology to determine the role of quaternary deposits versus fractured bedrock and slopes could be a next step to improve knowledge in alpine hydrogeological processes and their evolution with climate change this study gives important insights into the evolution of groundwater storage and streamflow under future climate changes in streamflows need to be considered in water management adaptation strategies since shifts to lower flows in summer combined with increased water needs could lead to water shortage the decrease in water volume during summer will reduce water availability during the warm periods for uses such as hydropower irrigation and recreation the increase of streamflow during winter could also be impactful for areas with increased winter water needs for ski tourism finally this study also shows the importance of low flows and therefore the need for good low flow measurements and model calibration for climate change projections which is still not always the case within climate change impact studies in alpine environments as such the role of groundwater and geology should be considered in future

5029,hydrologic models are most commonly calibrated only for streamflow at one or multiple stations within the watershed however it has been argued that in distributed hydrologic models with large numbers of parameters it is possible to get good streamflow statistics with a completely incorrect representation of the internal watershed processes consequently these models fail when they are used for other purposes for example biogeochemical prediction specifically in watersheds dominated by agricultural land use there is information on crop yield that is rarely used for constraining hydrologic fluxes however crops can potentially act as distributed sensors in the landscape and help in constraining evapotranspiration fluxes and improving model consistency our main goal in this paper is to address this important process understanding and show how using the information on crop yield helps to identify the proper model structure thereby improving the robustness of hydrologic models using a 32 660 km2 agricultural watershed in iowa as a case study we used stepwise model refinement to show how the consideration of additional data sources can increase model consistency we first developed a hydrologic model using the soil and water assessment tool that provided excellent monthly streamflow statistics at eight stations within the watershed however comparing crop yield measurements with modeled results revealed a strong underestimation in model estimates and it was apparent that the model was getting the right streamflow by lowering the evapotranspiration flux and allowing the crops to die adding crop yield as an additional calibration target allowed us to identify the models structural deficiency and alter the potential evapotranspiration estimation method thereby considerably improved model predictions of crop yield while not altering streamflow predictions considerably the modified model was able to i better capture variations in nitrate loads at the catchment outlet with no calibration and ii reduce parameter uncertainty model prediction uncertainty and equifinality these findings highlight that using additional data sources to improve the hydrological consistency of distributed models increases their robustness and predictive ability keywords crop yield flow partitioning prediction and parameter uncertainties penman monteith pet tile flow soil and water assessment tool swat calibration 1 introduction conventional distributed hydrologic models are most commonly evaluated using only streamflow information at one or multiple gaging stations within the watershed cao et al 2006 rouhani et al 2007 santhi et al 2008 wang et al 2012 2016 boscarello et al 2013 wi et al 2015 xuexianwu et al 2016 these models are often limited by a lack of adequate spatially distributed data grayson et al 2002 and rely on complex calibration validation techniques for the estimation of a large number of model parameters madsen 2003 this leads to what is commonly referred to as the equifinality issue where multiple model parameter sets can lead to the same response at the watershed outlet beven and binley 1992 beven and freer 2001 beven 2006 recent studies have highlighted the ability of ancillary datasets either spatially distributed information on vegetation and rainfall cusack et al 1997 yilmaz et al 2005 spies et al 2014 alazzy et al 2017 hunink et al 2017 ren et al 2018 or soft data on flow partitioning seibert and mcdonnell 2002 yilmaz et al 2008 arnold et al 2015 to increase the consistency of hydrologic models for example models driven by remotely sensed meteorological data e g nexrad rainfall data and land surface temperature had been shown to capture spatial patterns of runoff with greater accuracy than conventional hydrologic models andersen et al 2002 stisen et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 cunha et al 2012 remotely sensed vegetation data had been used as either model inputs to drive evapotranspiration glenn et al 2007 2011 or for model calibration and validation immerzeel and droogers 2008 liang and qin 2008 for example ma et al 2019 used remotely sensed leaf area index lai data in the swat model to improve the crop growth process which in turn improved streamflow and sediment yield predictions rajib et al 2018 used remotely sensed potential evapotranspiration pet data as an input in the swat model to improve the streamflow soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration rajib et al 2016 used remotely sensed soil moisture data to improve hydrologic predictions while qiao et al 2013 used grace derived water storage and field measured water table information to reduce parameter uncertainty in addition there has been a trend in the recent decade towards soft calibration and recognizing the value of soft data in increasing model robustness arnold et al 2015 vaché and mcdonnell 2006 yen et al 2014 2016 for example seibert and mcdonnell 2002 and pfannerstill et al 2017 showed how soft data on flow partitioning could be used effectively in improving consistency in hydrologic modeling shafii et al 2017 observed adding additional flow partitioning constraints in model calibration which helped improve the parameter identifiability and reduced model uncertainty incorrect flow partitioning can also affect solute transport since different pathways have unique biogeochemical signatures kannan et al 2007 yen et al 2014 bieger et al 2015 mockler et al 2016 shafii et al 2017 2019 however these examples of using ancillary data are few and the vast majority of hydrologic model studies rely solely on streamflow data a scopus literature review was performed by the authors by considering modeling studies between 1995 and 2015 that used the soil water assessment tool swat the literature review revealed that only 31 1 5 of the 2084 swat papers used crop yield as a calibration target in addition to streamflow this is somewhat surprising given that crop yield information is relatively easy to obtain at the watershed scale since agricultural agencies in all countries routinely collect and curate this data furthermore swat unlike some hydrologic models simulates crop growth and thus can provide information on crop yield that can be directly used in model calibration and validation the overall objective of this study is to quantify the value of ancillary data crop yield and flow partitioning information in increasing the consistency and robustness of hydrologic models by the proper representation of internal watershed processes leading to the right answers for the right reasons kirchner 2006 a secondary objective is to highlight how increasing model consistency with respect to water flow leads to a 1 reduction in equifinality and 2 increased predictive ability for streamflow at the daily timescale and solutes like nitrate 2 methods 2 1 study site the 32 600 km2 iowa cedar basin icb fig 1 is drained by the iowa and cedar rivers and the watershed extends from southern minnesota to the confluence with the mississippi river the mean annual rainfall in icb is approximately 864 mm seo et al 2013 and the average annual temperature is around 10 c icrb report 2010 the icb is an agricultural watershed with corn and soybean being the dominant crops while the corn and soybean cultivation occupy approximately 42 and 26 of the watershed area respectively 6 of the watershed is occupied by other crop varieties the rest of the watershed area comprises pasture and rangelands 15 urban areas 8 and wetlands and water bodies 3 usda 2012 the predominant soils of icb are loam and silty loam soils which cover approximately 96 percent of the watershed le 2015 2 2 swat model description soil water assessment tool swat is a watershed scale process based continuous simulation model that runs at daily time steps to predict streamflow and nutrient loads the watershed is divided into sub basins that are further subdivided into hydrologic response unit hru characterized by the unique soil land use and slope major modules of swat are climate hydrology plant growth erosion nutrients pesticides and management practices surface runoff is computed using either the scs curve number method that computes runoff under varying land use and soil type or the green ampt infiltration method that requires sub daily precipitation data infiltrated water is stored in soils and used for evapotranspiration or reaches the stream network as lateral flow a portion of the infiltrated water also reaches the groundwater the crop growth cycle is governed by the heat unit theory each degree of temperature exceeding the plant s base temperature is considered as a heat unit and each crop s potential heat units are defined in swat s database plant growth occurs when the given day s temperature exceeds the plant s base temperature and continues until the daily accumulated heat units reach the potential heat unit in the absence of exact planting harvesting and management operation dates data crop growth cycle and management operations are modeled through heat units scheduling i e as a function of plant s potential heat units in swat s plant growth module the development of plant biomass is driven by three important parameters they are leaf area index lai photosynthetically active radiation a portion of the solar radiation and radiation use efficiency total dry biomass produced per unit intercepted solar radiation the amount of par intercepted by the crop is a function of lai of the crop and total biomass produced on a given day is the product of par and radiation use efficiency of the crop crop yield is calculated as a product of above ground biomass and crop specific harvest index where harvest index is the fraction of above ground dry biomass removed during harvest the remaining fraction of the crop after the harvest is converted into the residue during the growth stage for optimal growth the crop requires water and nutrients crops water requirement is set equivalent to the daily evapotranspiration and daily nutrient requirements are obtained from fertilizers in the absence of actual fertilizer application data the auto fertilization routine could be turned on which applies fertilizer to the crop whenever the crop experiences nutrient stress the crop growth is impacted by insufficient water and nutrients and extreme temperatures the water temperature and nutrient stress equations are explained in section s1 supplementary information for more details refer to neitsch et al 2011 2 3 swat model setup input data and parameters we used input datasets related to climate soil land use and discharge that were collected by le 2015 for the icb here we present key aspects of the data sources used while further details are available in le 2015 digital elevation model dem data 30 m resolution was obtained from united states geological survey usgs national elevation dataset usgs 2013 while soil data was obtained from the united states department of agriculture usda statsgo2 soil survey staff n d dataset land use and land cover data were derived from the iowa department of natural resources dnr iowa dnr 2012 the multi resolution land characteristics consortium s mrlc national land cover dataset nlcd fry et al 2012 and the usda s crop data layer cdl usda cdl 2012 these three datasets had different spatial and temporal extents and thus all three were needed to capture the land use trends appropriately using the dem the watershed was first divided into 67 sub basins using a 1 flow accumulation area threshold 327 km2 and the sub basins were further discretized into hydrological response units hrus using a threshold of 5 for land use soil and slope daily precipitation and temperature data for 48 weather stations fig 1 were obtained from the us national weather service us nws n d united states environmental protection agency us epa 2013 and iowa environmental mesonet n d while swat s automatic weather generator was used for relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation data discharge data for the eight stream gauge stations were obtained from usgs 2016 from 1993 to 2012 we further collected crop yield data that was not included in the le 2015 study the major crop varieties of icb are corn and soybean county scale annual corn and soybean yield data downloaded from the usda agricultural survey 2012 was used for crop yield calibration annual crop yield data obtained for 31 counties of icb in wet weight bu acre was converted to dry weight t ha based on guidelines outlined in gassman 2008 to compare with swat simulated crop yield crop yield at the county scale was converted to the sub basin scale using area weighting further we assumed that tile drains were present on all agricultural hrus given the icb is dominated with poorly drained and moderately drained soils sloan 2013 and due to lack of information on the exact location of the tile drains we explored alternate methods of estimating tile drain density based on databases provided by iowa dnr 2017 that were based on either i an incomplete digitized record of tile drains or ii estimate of soils requiring tile drains based on slopes and soil type as described by kalcic et al 2015 however ground truthing in several sub watersheds revealed that on the ground tile density was much greater than estimated by these maps indeed with increasing high flow events tile density has been increasing in iowa and thus we used the conservative estimate that all agricultural areas were drained we obtained information on nitrate loads at the outlet of the icb from usgs 2016 the auto fertilization routine in swat was used to estimate fertilizer application rates the maximum amount of elemental nitrogen and p2o5 applied to corn and soybean per year was restricted to 218 5 kg ha yr and 45 kg ha yr based on the recommendations of mallarino et al 2013 and sawyer 2015 2 4 model calibration and validation we calibrated and validated the swat 2012 model ver 635 for discharge and crop yield discharge specific calibration parameters were selected based on le 2015 while crop growth parameters were selected based on nair et al 2011 table s1 the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi2 abbaspour et al 2007 which is capable of performing multi objective calibration and uncertainty analysis was used for model calibration and validation yang et al 2008 faramarzi et al 2009 a global sensitivity analysis was done using the sufi 2 algorithm section s2 the model was calibrated from 1993 to 2002 and validated from 2003 to 2012 with a three year warm up period from 1990 to 1992 stepwise model refinement was used to demonstrate the value of adding crop yield and flow partitioning since the development of each scenario was guided by the model results obtained from the previous scenario details of the scenario development are described in section 3 1 3 3 the kling gupta efficiency kge was used as the objective function and the sufi2 algorithm abbaspour 2012 was used for model calibration and validation for the baseline scenario simultaneous calibration was done at eight streamflow stations fig 1 with each station given equal weight and the sufi2 algorithm was used to maximize the overall kge for the crop yield scenarios the objective function used is the weighted average of 8 streamflow stations and corn and soybean yields of nine selected sub basins 26 calibration targets in total fig 1 the sufi2 algorithm tries to achieve a kge value of 1 through multiple iterations all scenarios were subjected to three iterations with 250 runs per iteration the sufi2 algorithm produced the best parameter set at the end of each iteration and also provided the new calibration parameter ranges for the next iteration which is narrower than the previous iteration s calibration parameter ranges results from the third iteration are then used for comparing alternate model realizations although calibration and validation were done using only kge we also evaluated the performance of the models with respect to the performance metrics rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr and percent bias pbias the evaluation metrics were estimated using the best parameter set of the third iteration of each scenario the calibration was performed at monthly time step for discharge and annual time step for crop yield the daily discharge calibration was not performed due to the increase in overall calibration effort 1 k g e 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the linear

2016 and rajib et al 2016 while prediction uncertainty was evaluated using the methodology outlined in abbaspour 2012 the use of behavioral solution sets solutions that comprise of multiple parameter combinations that can produce equally satisfactory responses at the watershed outlet to evaluate parameter uncertainly has been widely used beven 1993 rajib and merwade 2016 behavioral solutions are filtered from the entire solution set by using an absolute threshold sellami et al 2016 rajib and merwade 2016 rajib et al 2016 or a relative threshold her and chaubey 2015 her et al 2019 the choice of threshold method and magnitude is a subjective decision made by the modeler sellami et al 2016 her and chaubey 2015 we used the relative threshold method based on her and chaubey 2015 in this study a behavioral threshold was defined as parameter sets that produced the top 2 5 kge values in the final third iteration and these are hereafter referred to as behavioral solutions note that the sufi2 calibration program at the end of each iteration suggests new calibration bounds that are narrower than the initial calibration bounds for the next iteration due to the usage of narrower calibration bounds in subsequent iterations the solution set of the final iteration is always better than the previous iterations the posterior distribution of calibrated parameter values from behavioral solutions is created to understand i the calibrated parameters spread pattern and position pn method used in this study defined in eq 4 below within the upper and lower calibration bounds and ii the change in statistical metrics mean median standard deviation skewness coefficient of variation confidence interval ci range inter quartile range iqr etc of parameter values across multiple model scenarios with the help of the statistical metrics or pn values scores the parameter uncertainty can be estimated for example the reduction in coefficient of variation her and chaubey 2015 or reduction in iqr rajib and merwade 2016 rajib et al 2016 shafii et al 2019 pfannerstill et al 2017 across multiple model scenarios would mean a reduction in parameter uncertainty we have used pn method in this study and then estimated the iqr based on rajib and merwade 2016 and rajib et al 2016 for comparing multiple parameter values under a common scale the parameter values were normalized so that the variations are restricted within a 0 100 score scale thus the normalized parameter uncertainty score pn was defined as 4 pn pb l l ul l l 100 where pb is the behavioral parameter value and ul and ll are the upper and lower limit of the parameter respectively rajib and merwade 2016 rajib et al 2016 note that pn is just a scoring technique that transforms the position of a calibrated parameter value within the calibration ranges upper and lower into a score number the iqr of the pn values scores for each of the key parameters were compared between model scenarios to evaluate the effect of modifications on parameter uncertainty fig 4 the prediction uncertainty could generally be quantified using multiple metrics such as containing ratio cr average bandwidth b average relative bandwidth rb average asymmetry degree average deviation amplitude p factor d factor and r factor yang et al 2008 xiong et al 2009 abbaspour et al 2007 abbaspour 2012 teweldebrhan et al 2018 the metric used varies with the calibration algorithm for example the cr index is extensively used for the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimator glue calibration algorithm similarly p factor and r factor are extensively used in the sufi 2 calibration algorithm based studies given their efficiency in estimating the model prediction uncertainty and due to usage of the sufi 2 algorithm for calibration in this study we chose p factor and r factor indices the p factor is defined as a fraction of the observed data for example streamflow bracketed by the 95 prediction uncertainty ppu band and the r factor is defined as the average thickness of 95 ppu band divided by the standard deviation of the observed data yang et al 2008 abbaspour 2012 for more details on the sufi 2 calibration algorithm p factor and r factor refer to abbaspour 2012 the p factor and r factor can vary between 0 and 1 and 0 and infinity respectively theoretically a p factor of 1 and r factor of 0 is a simulation that corresponds exactly to observed data higher p factor value and lower r factor value imply a lower prediction uncertainty ekstrand et al 2010 bouda et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 streamflow calibration and validation baseline scenario we calibrated the model from 1993 to 2002 and validated from 2003 to 2012 simultaneous calibration and validation were done using monthly streamflow data at all eight stations within the watershed the model performed well during the calibration and the validation periods both at the outlet of the watershed in the wapello station fig 2 a and all seven internal stations the metrics kge rsr and pbias varied between 0 74 and 0 87 0 42 to 0 68 and 13 7 to 8 6 respectively during the calibration period and between 0 43 and 0 85 0 49 to 0 92 and 25 9 to 8 7 respectively during the validation period table 1 and table s6 this scenario is hereafter referred to as the baseline scenario bs 3 2 crop yield performance evaluation baseline scenario the calibrated model baseline scenario was then used to estimate crop yield across the entire watershed the model underpredicted both corn and soybean yields fig 2 b and c figure s1 a and b with underestimation being greater for soybean compared to corn 26 underestimation of the mean yield for corn and 61 for soybean crop yields are generally low when there is water or temperature stress in the system on exploring model outputs it was identified that the corn hrus were under water stress on an average for 27 days out of the 150 day growing season between 1993 and 2012 while soybean hrus were under water stress on an average for 33 days out of the 150 day growing season fig 2 d and figure s1 c furthermore the water storage within the soil profile was below the field capacity and wilting point leading the system to water stress for the entire growing season fig 2 d and figure s1 c this explained the poor crop yield observed in the results and highlighted the need for adding crop yield as a calibration target 3 3 stepwise model refinement crop yield calibration scenario s1 in the next step of model refinement scenario s1 the annual corn and soybean yields at nine internal sub basins were added as calibration targets in addition to discharge crop specific parameters like maximum potential leaf area index blai heat units heat units plant radiation use efficiency bio e and harvest index hvsti were used for model calibration in addition to streamflow specific parameters table s1 this led to a slight improvement in crop yield but corn and soybean yield was still underpredicted by 27 and 52 respectively figure s2 b streamflow metrics were predicted with a similar level of accuracy as the baseline scenario table 1 and table s6 the crop water stress values and soil water content were also similar between the two scenarios figure s2 d and much higher than what is typically expected in a humid climate like iowa we hypothesize that this can be created by overestimation of potential evapotranspiration pet which would potentially lead to drying up of the soil contributing to water stress and reduced crop uptake of water this led us to consider alternate model formulations for the estimation of evapotranspiration as described in the next section the results of sensitivity analysis section s2 table s2 through s5 highlight that when crop yield is added as a calibration target the sensitivity to crop yield parameters like blai corn blai soyb heat units corn and heat units soyb increases table s3 this indicates that useful information is being added by including crop yield as a target 3 4 stepwise model refinement model structural changes improvement of evapotranspiration scenarios s2 and s2a due to its wide usage the pm pet method was used in the baseline and the s1 scenario schneider et al 2007 milly and dunne 2016 however the average annual pet estimated by the model 1516 mm seemed to be exceedingly high compared to estimated data in iowa during the same years green et al 2006 1190 mm daryl herzmann iowa environmental mesonet 2019 1175 mm to address this issue the temperature based hargreaves hg pet method was considered in the next step of model refinement scenario s2 with everything else being the same as scenario s1 this led to a significant improvement in crop yield figure s3 b and c with corn and soybean yield being underpredicted by only 2 and 9 respectively while the streamflow statistics kge and rsr improved slightly table 1 and table s6 potential evapotranspiration predicted by the hg method was lower than the pm method 963 mm compared to 1516 mm and the average water stress days for both corn and soybean hrus were reduced to zero days during the150 day growing season between 1993 and 2012 figure s3 d to quantify the relative contribution of this structural change in pet versus the effect of crop yield calibration we did another simulation scenario s2a which is the same as scenario s2 except there is no crop yield calibration the structural model change s2a led to a greater improvement in streamflow above the baseline scenario table 1 and table s6 than the crop yield calibration scenario s1 however consideration of both structural model change and crop yield calibration s2 led to the greatest improvement in both streamflow and crop yield table 1 table s6 and table 3 3 5 stepwise model refinement model structural changes improvement of flow partitioning scenarios s3 and s3a we then evaluated the effect of model refinement on the partitioning of water along the lateral flow pathways namely surface runoff lateral flow tile flow and groundwater flow although scenario s2 yielded acceptable model statistics for both crop yield and streamflow it led to the tile flow pathway contributing to only 17 of the total flow while surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow corresponded to 74 7 and 2 of the total flow respectively table 2 this highlights the serious underestimation of tile flow for a watershed that is 68 tile drained a review study conducted by howe and moore 2016 highlighted that the percent flow through tiles could range from 37 to 86 in north american watersheds while a study in a neighboring watershed reported a tile flow percent of 67 green et al 2006 thus the next stage of model refinement involved interrogating the variables responsible for flow partitioning it has been argued that the traditional curve number method in swat that uses soil moisture based curve number prediction icn 0 in swat manuals generates too much surface runoff in shallow soils kannan et al 2007 neitsch et al 2011 amatya and jha 2011 there exists an alternate evapotranspiration based curve number method in swat icn 1 that links the retention parameter s in cn with soil moisture depletion which in turn is governed by pet rainfall and runoff in this method it is possible to have control over the allocation of surface and subsurface flow through infiltration without affecting the et amatya and jha 2011 using the et based cn prediction method the cncoeff parameter was manually adjusted to achieve a tile flow of 67 similar to green et al 2006 and howe and moore 2016 table 2 also this scenario s3 was able to provide good streamflow fig 2 e and crop yield estimates fig 2 f and g figure s1 d and e we did an additional simulation scenario s3a to isolate the effect of crop yield calibration targets and flow partitioning constraints here we added flow partitioning constraints and used the hg pet model but did not calibrate for crop yield on comparing s3 and s3a we found s3a s streamflow metrics and flow through multiple pathways surface tile lateral and baseflow are comparable to s3 however s3 s crop yield metrics were better due to crop calibration thus the addition of crop yield calibration targets improved only the crop yield metrics while the inclusion of flow partitioning constraints improved flow partitioning table 2 while we did not have information on site specific flow partitioning metrics if available better estimates can be used to refine the model further for reasonable flow partitioning while still maintaining streamflow table 1 and table 7 and crop yield statistics table 3 3 6 model comparison sub basin scale crop yield improvements across the six scenarios analyzed in this paper bs s1 s2 s2a s3 and s3a the addition of crop yield and flow partitioning parameters led to some improvement in streamflow prediction table 1 and table s6 the biggest improvement however occurred in crop yield estimates where watershed scale pbias of corn decreased from 26 for the bs scenario to 3 in the s3 scenario and pbias of soybean decreased from 61 for the bs scenarios to 4 in the s3 scenario fig 2 b and f figure s1 a and d table 3 also the crop yield estimates for nine selected sub basins were considerably better for the s2 and s3 scenarios compared to the baseline and s1 scenarios table 3 due to the change in the representation of potential evapotranspiration in the model the crop yield estimates of s2a and s3a were poor due to no calibration of crop parameters in these scenarios since the model was calibrated for crop yield at only nine sub basins the ability of the model to describe spatial variations in crop yield for all 67 sub watersheds within the iowa cedar basin for bs s2 and s3 scenarios was evaluated further fig 3 note that the s2a and s3a scenarios were not included for this analysis since crop yield parameters were not calibrated for corn only 12 of the sub basins fell within the acceptable pbias window 10 to 10 for bs while 95 and 97 of the sub basins had acceptable pbias values for s2 and s3 scenarios respectively for soybean the results were more dramatic where no sub basins with acceptable pbias existed in the bs scenario while 51 and 78 of the sub basins had acceptable pbias values for the s2 and s3 scenarios respectively it is possible that further model refinement of swat s crop representation is needed for better performance for soybean 3 7 model performance evaluation parameter uncertainty the impact of model refinement bs vs s2 vs s3 on parameter uncertainty was evaluated by plotting the normalized uncertainty scores of the twelve parameters across all behavioral solutions 56 for bs 19 for s2 and 19 for s3 the fewer behavioral solutions arise in s2 and s3 because of the larger number of calibration targets which ensure that the parameter space is more tightly constrained than in the bs scenario we argue that this is what contributes to the hydrologic robustness of the s3 scenario a decrease increase in the interquartile range of the normalized uncertainty score indicates a decrease increase in uncertainty for the particular model scenario overall there is a reduction in uncertainty for most of the parameters between the bs and the s2 and s3 scenarios ch n2 sol z sol awc sol k esco epco alpha bf and gw revap indicating that model refinement successfully constrained the parameter space three of the parameters surlag gw delay and dep imp showed little difference in uncertainty between bs and s2 and s3 scenarios while the most dramatic increase in uncertainty between the bs s2 and s3 scenarios was apparent for cn2 the iqr of cn2 increased from 2 for the bs to 9for the s2 and 14 for the s3 scenarios fig 4 to understand this increase in uncertainty the magnitude of the cn2 parameter was explored between the bs and the s2 and s3 scenarios in the bs scenario the cn2 parameter is tightly constrained with the best value being equal to 94 a curve number magnitude that more closely represents urban areas with impervious land cover curve number 98 usda nrcs 2004 than agricultural areas that characterize the icb in contrast the best parameter value of cn2 under the s2 and s3 corresponds to cn2 values of 76 and 73 which is closer to curve number values that can be expected for this watershed given soil type and predominant land use based on usda nrcs 2004 the average runoff curve number value for soil hydrologic group b which covers 97 of agricultural lands in the study area and agricultural row crops under multiple residue cover treatments corresponds to 76 thus even though the bs scenario led to a more tightly constrained cn2 estimate it led to a hydrologically unrealistic estimate of cn2 the effects of our calibration on parameter uncertainty are somewhat mixed with only 50 of the parameters showing a decrease in uncertainty from bs to s2 while 58 of the parameters showed a decrease in uncertainty from s2 to s3 when comparing scenarios s2a and s3a with s2 and s3 reduction in parameter uncertainty was found in 75 and 83 of the parameters fig 4 respectively due to the presence of crop yield calibration targets in s2 and s3 to check the influence of flow partitioning constraints on parameter uncertainty s2a and s3a were compared s3a showed a reduction in parameter uncertainty only for 42 of parameters when compared with s2a note that both s2a and s3a are not calibrated for crop yield fig 4 while the impact of flow partitioning constraints on parameter uncertainty produced mixed results the inclusion of crop yield targets reduced parameter uncertainty for the majority of the parameters 3 8 prediction uncertainty and equifinality model refinement led to a decrease in prediction uncertainty specifically the p factor in model predictions decreased from 0 39 in bs to 0 26 in s2 and 0 31 in s3 while the r factor decreased from 0 44 in the bs scenario to 0 16 in s2 and 0 14 in s3 achieving a low r factor also reduces the p factor and thus there should be a reasonable trade off between these two factors yang et al 2008 ekstrand et al 2010 abbaspour 2012 bouda et al 2012 zuo et al 2015 the results indicate that while almost the same amount of observed streamflow variability is captured within the 95 ppu band for bs and s3 39 of observed data in bs versus 31 in s3 a narrower uncertainty band was achieved in scenario s3 compared to the baseline scenario 0 44 in bs compared to 0 14 in s3 table 4 we further found on comparing s2a and s3a scenarios with s2 and s3 scenarios respectively that crop yield calibration did not reduce the prediction uncertainty table 4 however s3a captured 3 more observed streamflow variability than s2a with a slightly narrower uncertainty band r factor thus prediction uncertainty was reduced in s3a when compared with s2a due to the inclusion of flow partitioning constraints this comparative analysis demonstrates that the inclusion of flow partitioning constraints in calibration reduced the prediction uncertainty while the inclusion of crop yield calibration targets did not table 4 overall s3 is considered to be better than all other scenarios due to i the higher p factor and lower r factor values and ii proper simulation of crop yield and flow through surface and subsurface pathways we further evaluated whether model improvement led to a reduction in equifinality by analyzing the simulations that led to the top 2 5 kge estimates behavioral solutions for bs s2 and s3 scenarios the analysis revealed that the bs had 56 behavioral solutions while s2 s2a s3 and s3a had 19 229 19 and 195 behavioral solutions respectively that fell within the top 2 5 kge threshold the reduction in the number of behavioral solutions in s2 and s3 due to the inclusion of additional crop yield and flow partitioning constraints indicates a reduction in the equifinality of the model simulations the choice of relative threshold number 2 5 is subjective an increase in this threshold would lead to a greater number of behavioral parameter solutions which in turn might increase the parameter uncertainty her et al 2019 the impact of relative threshold number and corresponding behavioral solutions on parameter and prediction uncertainty among the 4 model scenarios though interesting is beyond the scope of this study however we expect that the conclusion of reduction in prediction uncertainty for the s3 scenario compared to the bs scenario would still hold at different threshold values 3 9 model predictive ability at daily time scale our model was calibrated and validated at the monthly timescale to further evaluate the effect of developing a more hydrologically consistent model on streamflow statistics the ability of bs s2 and s3 scenarios to predict daily streamflow were estimated this is important since a model developed at the monthly timescale is not expected to describe daily streamflow statistics since the parameter values are calibrated to match the monthly flow values which could suppress the errors at the daily time step sudheer et al 2007 the bs and s2 scenarios were not able to capture the daily streamflow statistics table 5 and table s7 despite being able to describe the monthly streamflow table 1 and table s6 in contrast the s3 scenario showed good statistics kge 0 73 and 0 66 rsr 0 69 and 0 80 during the calibration and validation periods table 5 and table s7 the improvement achieved in the s3 scenario is also clearly visible in the daily hydrographs fig 5 the daily streamflow statistics for the s2a and s3a scenarios were however similar to the corresponding s2 and s3 scenarios this indicates that crop yield calibration didn t improve the daily streamflow but flow partitioning did table 5 table s7 fig 5 despite being calibrated at a monthly timescale the fact that the daily streamflow statistics are captured effectively highlights how creating a more hydrologically consistent model s3 allowed it to be more robust even at a timescale at which it was not expected to perform well improvement in daily streamflow statistics from s2 and s3 can be attributed primarily to a more robust description of the subsurface flow partitioning in s3 a substantial increase in flow through the subsurface pathway 88 of total water yield was achieved due to the change of the flow partitioning method and this led to an improvement in the daily streamflow statistics 3 10 model predictive ability for nitrogen fluxes the ability of the model to predict annual nitrate loads without any calibration was also evaluated the bs and s2 scenario showed significant underprediction pbias 61 for bs and 28 for s2 of nitrate loads whereas pbias was only equal to 10 for s3 fig 6 without any calibration the improved ability of the s2 scenario over the bs scenario is attributed to crop yield calibration while the improvement achieved in the s3 scenario is attributed to both improved crop yield and appropriate flow partitioning a comparison of s2a with the s3a scenario indicates that flow partitioning was more important than crop yield calibration for nitrate loads fig 6 in s3 more water is diverted to the subsurface flow pathway that accesses nitrogen stores leading to a more appropriate representation of nitrate fluxes this again highlights that increasing the consistency of hydrology models increases their predictive ability even for uncalibrated parameters 4 summary and conclusions the overall objective of our study was to quantify the value of ancillary data such as crop yield and flow partitioning information in increasing the robustness of hydrologic models by the proper representation of internal watershed processes to achieve this objective we first calibrated a swat model in a large 32 660 km2 agricultural basin in iowa the model was able to reproduce very well the monthly streamflow statistics at eight stations within the watershed however when the crop yield estimates from the model were compared with available crop yield data from the agricultural census the model severely underestimated crop yield pbias corn 26 and pbias soybean 61 this low crop yield was the product of a landscape where the soil water content was low and the corn and soybean crops were water stressed for long durations a diagnostic model evaluation allowed us to identify high potential evapotranspiration pet estimated by the most commonly used penman monteith method to be the underlying cause of the model deficiency altering the pet method to the hargreaves method and adding crop yield as a calibration target decreased the pet and thus led to excellent crop yield statistics pbias corn 2 and pbias soybean 9 while not altering the streamflow statistics considerably although pm pet is the most commonly used pet formulation in hydrologic models schneider et al 2007 earls and dixon 2008 a recent study has shown that they lead to consistent overestimation milly and dunne 2016 and alternate methods like the hargreaves makkink and priestley taylor pet methods can often lead to more reasonable estimates wang et al 2006 schneider et al 2007 earls and dixon 2008 sperna weiland et al 2012 tadesse et al 2016 samadi 2016 what is interesting is that despite such an overestimation of pet the model was able to capture the discharge statistics adequately by reducing the actual evapotranspiration to realistic values by allowing the crops to die such that actual evapotranspiration and thus streamflow is almost unchanged between the scenarios a classic example of getting the right streamflow but for the wrong reasons we also evaluated the effect of the partitioning of flow between the surface and subsurface flow pathways on model robustness changing the flow partitioning method in swat from the traditional soil moisture based curve number method to the evapotranspiration based curve number method contributed to 67 of the flow to be transmitted through the tiled pathway in contrast to 17 observed in the traditional method the watershed is heavily tile drained 68 and 67 is a more realistic flow partitioning magnitude increasing the consistency of the hydrological model by incorporating crop yield information and soft data on flow partitioning had multiple benefits first the inclusion of crop yield calibration targets in the calibration has reduced the parameter uncertainty while the inclusion of flow partitioning constraints has reduced the prediction uncertainty second the modified model proved to be superior in predicting daily flows despite being calibrated at the monthly timescale finally increasing the hydrologic consistency of the model increased its ability to predict nitrate fluxes without any calibration the study highlights the value of using soft data and ancillary datasets like crop yield information to improve the consistency of hydrologic and biogeochemical models with crop data from both remotely sensed observations and agricultural census being more easily accessible agricultural system models like swat should routinely start using these data sources to enhance model

5029,hydrologic models are most commonly calibrated only for streamflow at one or multiple stations within the watershed however it has been argued that in distributed hydrologic models with large numbers of parameters it is possible to get good streamflow statistics with a completely incorrect representation of the internal watershed processes consequently these models fail when they are used for other purposes for example biogeochemical prediction specifically in watersheds dominated by agricultural land use there is information on crop yield that is rarely used for constraining hydrologic fluxes however crops can potentially act as distributed sensors in the landscape and help in constraining evapotranspiration fluxes and improving model consistency our main goal in this paper is to address this important process understanding and show how using the information on crop yield helps to identify the proper model structure thereby improving the robustness of hydrologic models using a 32 660 km2 agricultural watershed in iowa as a case study we used stepwise model refinement to show how the consideration of additional data sources can increase model consistency we first developed a hydrologic model using the soil and water assessment tool that provided excellent monthly streamflow statistics at eight stations within the watershed however comparing crop yield measurements with modeled results revealed a strong underestimation in model estimates and it was apparent that the model was getting the right streamflow by lowering the evapotranspiration flux and allowing the crops to die adding crop yield as an additional calibration target allowed us to identify the models structural deficiency and alter the potential evapotranspiration estimation method thereby considerably improved model predictions of crop yield while not altering streamflow predictions considerably the modified model was able to i better capture variations in nitrate loads at the catchment outlet with no calibration and ii reduce parameter uncertainty model prediction uncertainty and equifinality these findings highlight that using additional data sources to improve the hydrological consistency of distributed models increases their robustness and predictive ability keywords crop yield flow partitioning prediction and parameter uncertainties penman monteith pet tile

of adequate spatially distributed data grayson et al 2002 and rely on complex calibration validation techniques for the estimation of a large number of model parameters madsen 2003 this leads to what is commonly referred to as the equifinality issue where multiple model parameter sets can lead to the same response at the watershed outlet beven and binley 1992 beven and freer 2001 beven 2006 recent studies have highlighted the ability of ancillary datasets either spatially distributed information on vegetation and rainfall cusack et al 1997 yilmaz et al 2005 spies et al 2014 alazzy et al 2017 hunink et al 2017 ren et al 2018 or soft data on flow partitioning seibert and mcdonnell 2002 yilmaz et al 2008 arnold et al 2015 to increase the consistency of hydrologic models for example models driven by remotely sensed meteorological data e g nexrad rainfall data and land surface temperature had been shown to capture spatial patterns of runoff with greater accuracy than conventional hydrologic models andersen et al 2002 stisen et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 cunha et al 2012 remotely sensed vegetation data had been used as either model inputs to drive evapotranspiration glenn et al 2007 2011 or for model calibration and validation immerzeel and droogers 2008 liang and qin 2008 for example ma et al 2019 used remotely sensed leaf area index lai data in the swat model to improve the crop growth process which in turn improved streamflow and sediment yield predictions rajib et al 2018 used remotely sensed potential evapotranspiration pet data as an input in the swat model to improve the streamflow soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration rajib et al 2016 used remotely sensed soil moisture data to improve hydrologic predictions while qiao et al 2013 used grace derived water storage and field measured water table information to reduce parameter uncertainty in addition there has been a trend in the recent decade towards soft calibration and recognizing the value of soft data in increasing model robustness arnold et al 2015 vaché and mcdonnell 2006 yen et al 2014 2016 for example seibert and mcdonnell 2002 and pfannerstill et al 2017 showed how soft data on flow partitioning could be used effectively in improving consistency in hydrologic modeling shafii et al 2017 observed adding additional flow partitioning constraints in model calibration which helped improve the parameter identifiability and reduced model uncertainty incorrect flow partitioning can also affect solute transport since different pathways have unique biogeochemical signatures kannan et al 2007 yen et al 2014 bieger et al 2015 mockler et al 2016 shafii et al 2017 2019 however these examples of using ancillary data are few and the vast majority of hydrologic model studies rely solely on streamflow data a scopus literature review was performed by the authors by considering modeling studies between 1995 and 2015 that used the soil water assessment tool swat the literature review revealed that only 31 1 5 of the 2084 swat papers used crop yield as a calibration target in addition to streamflow this is somewhat surprising given that crop yield information is relatively easy to obtain at the watershed scale since agricultural agencies in all countries routinely collect and curate this data furthermore swat unlike some hydrologic models simulates crop growth and thus can provide information on crop yield that can be directly used in model calibration and validation the overall objective of this study is to quantify the value of ancillary data crop yield and flow partitioning information in increasing the consistency and robustness of hydrologic models by the proper representation of internal watershed processes leading to the right answers for the right reasons kirchner 2006 a secondary objective is to highlight how increasing model consistency with respect to water flow leads to a 1 reduction in equifinality and 2 increased predictive ability for streamflow at the daily timescale and solutes like nitrate 2 methods 2 1 study site the 32 600 km2 iowa cedar basin icb fig 1 is drained by the iowa and cedar rivers and the watershed extends from southern minnesota to the confluence with the mississippi river the mean annual rainfall in icb is approximately 864 mm seo et al 2013 and the average annual temperature is around 10 c icrb report 2010 the icb is an agricultural watershed with corn and soybean being the dominant crops while the corn and soybean cultivation occupy approximately 42 and 26 of the watershed area respectively 6 of the watershed is occupied by other crop varieties the rest of the watershed area comprises pasture and rangelands 15 urban areas 8 and wetlands and water bodies 3 usda 2012 the predominant soils of icb are loam and silty loam soils which cover approximately 96 percent of the watershed le 2015 2 2 swat model description soil water assessment tool swat is a watershed scale process based continuous simulation model that runs at daily time steps to predict streamflow and nutrient loads the watershed is divided into sub basins that are further subdivided into hydrologic response unit hru characterized by the unique soil land use and slope major modules of swat are climate hydrology plant growth erosion nutrients pesticides and management practices surface runoff is computed using either the scs curve number method that computes runoff under varying land use and soil type or the green ampt infiltration method that requires sub daily precipitation data infiltrated water is stored in soils and used for evapotranspiration or reaches the stream network as lateral flow a portion of the infiltrated water also reaches the groundwater the crop growth cycle is governed by the heat unit theory each degree of temperature exceeding the plant s base temperature is considered as a heat unit and each crop s potential heat units are defined in swat s database plant growth occurs when the given day s temperature exceeds the plant s base temperature and continues until the daily accumulated heat units reach the potential heat unit in the absence of exact planting harvesting and management operation dates data crop growth cycle and management operations are modeled through heat units scheduling i e as a function of plant s potential heat units in swat s plant growth module the development of plant biomass is driven by three important parameters they are leaf area index lai photosynthetically active radiation a portion of the solar radiation and radiation use efficiency total dry biomass produced per unit intercepted solar radiation the amount of par intercepted by the crop is a function of lai of the crop and total biomass produced on a given day is the product of par and radiation use efficiency of the crop crop yield is calculated as a product of above ground biomass and crop specific harvest index where harvest index is the fraction of above ground dry biomass removed during harvest the remaining fraction of the crop after the harvest is converted into the residue during the growth stage for optimal growth the crop requires water and nutrients crops water requirement is set equivalent to the daily evapotranspiration and daily nutrient requirements are obtained from fertilizers in the absence of actual fertilizer application data the auto fertilization routine could be turned on which applies fertilizer to the crop whenever the crop experiences nutrient stress the crop growth is impacted by insufficient water and nutrients and extreme temperatures the water temperature and nutrient stress equations are explained in section s1 supplementary information for more details refer to neitsch et al 2011 2 3 swat model setup input data and parameters we used input datasets related to climate soil land use and discharge that were collected by le 2015 for the icb here we present key aspects of the data sources used while further details are available in le 2015 digital elevation model dem data 30 m resolution was obtained from united states geological survey usgs national elevation dataset usgs 2013 while soil data was obtained from the united states department of agriculture usda statsgo2 soil survey staff n d dataset land use and land cover data were derived from the iowa department of natural resources dnr iowa dnr 2012 the multi resolution land characteristics consortium s mrlc national land cover dataset nlcd fry et al 2012 and the usda s crop data layer cdl usda cdl 2012 these three datasets had different spatial and temporal extents and thus all three were needed to capture the land use trends appropriately using the dem the watershed was first divided into 67 sub basins using a 1 flow accumulation area threshold 327 km2 and the sub basins were further discretized into hydrological response units hrus using a threshold of 5 for land use soil and slope daily precipitation and temperature data for 48 weather stations fig 1 were obtained from the us national weather service us nws n d united states environmental protection agency us epa 2013 and iowa environmental mesonet n d while swat s automatic weather generator was used for relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation data discharge data for the eight stream gauge stations were obtained from usgs 2016 from 1993 to 2012 we further collected crop yield data that was not included in the le 2015 study the major crop varieties of icb are corn and soybean county scale annual corn and soybean yield data downloaded from the usda agricultural survey 2012 was used for crop yield calibration annual crop yield data obtained for 31 counties of icb in wet weight bu acre was converted to dry weight t ha based on guidelines outlined in gassman 2008 to compare with swat simulated crop yield crop yield at the county scale was converted to the sub basin scale using area weighting further we assumed that tile drains were present on all agricultural hrus given the icb is dominated with poorly drained and moderately drained soils sloan 2013 and due to lack of information on the exact location of the tile drains we explored alternate methods of estimating tile drain density based on databases provided by iowa dnr 2017 that were based on either i an incomplete digitized record of tile drains or ii estimate of soils requiring tile drains based on slopes and soil type as described by kalcic et al 2015 however ground truthing in several sub watersheds revealed that on the ground tile density was much greater than estimated by these maps indeed with increasing high flow events tile density has been increasing in iowa and thus we used the conservative estimate that all agricultural areas were drained we obtained information on nitrate loads at the outlet of the icb from usgs 2016 the auto fertilization routine in swat was used to estimate fertilizer application rates the maximum amount of elemental nitrogen and p2o5 applied to corn and soybean per year was restricted to 218 5 kg ha yr and 45 kg ha yr based on the recommendations of mallarino et al 2013 and sawyer 2015 2 4 model calibration and validation we calibrated and validated the swat 2012 model ver 635 for discharge and crop yield discharge specific calibration parameters were selected based on le 2015 while crop growth parameters were selected based on nair et al 2011 table s1 the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi2 abbaspour et al 2007 which is capable of performing multi objective calibration and uncertainty analysis was used for model calibration and validation yang et al 2008 faramarzi et al 2009 a global sensitivity analysis was done using the sufi 2 algorithm section s2 the model was calibrated from 1993 to 2002 and validated from 2003 to 2012 with a three year warm up period from 1990 to 1992 stepwise model refinement was used to demonstrate the value of adding crop yield and flow partitioning since the development of each scenario was guided by the model results obtained from the previous scenario details of the scenario development are described in section 3 1 3 3 the kling gupta efficiency kge was used as the objective function and the sufi2 algorithm abbaspour 2012 was used for model calibration and validation for the baseline scenario simultaneous calibration was done at eight streamflow stations fig 1 with each station given equal weight and the sufi2 algorithm was used to maximize the overall kge for the crop yield scenarios the objective function used is the weighted average of 8 streamflow stations and corn and soybean yields of nine selected sub basins 26 calibration targets in total fig 1 the sufi2 algorithm tries to achieve a kge value of 1 through multiple iterations all scenarios were subjected to three iterations with 250 runs per iteration the sufi2 algorithm produced the best parameter set at the end of each iteration and also provided the new calibration parameter ranges for the next iteration which is narrower than the previous iteration s calibration parameter ranges results from the third iteration are then used for comparing alternate model realizations although calibration and validation were done using only kge we also evaluated the performance of the models with respect to the performance metrics rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr and percent bias pbias the evaluation metrics were estimated using the best parameter set of the third iteration of each scenario the calibration was performed at monthly time step for discharge and annual time step for crop yield the daily discharge calibration was not performed due to the increase in overall calibration effort 1 k g e 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the linear

2016 and rajib et al 2016 while prediction uncertainty was evaluated using the methodology outlined in abbaspour 2012 the use of behavioral solution sets solutions that comprise of multiple parameter combinations that can produce equally satisfactory responses at the watershed outlet to evaluate parameter uncertainly has been widely used beven 1993 rajib and merwade 2016 behavioral solutions are filtered from the entire solution set by using an absolute threshold sellami et al 2016 rajib and merwade 2016 rajib et al 2016 or a relative threshold her and chaubey 2015 her et al 2019 the choice of threshold method and magnitude is a subjective decision made by the modeler sellami et al 2016 her and chaubey 2015 we used the relative threshold method based on her and chaubey 2015 in this study a behavioral threshold was defined as parameter sets that produced the top 2 5 kge values in the final third iteration and these are hereafter referred to as behavioral solutions note that the sufi2 calibration program at the end of each iteration suggests new calibration bounds that are narrower than the initial calibration bounds for the next iteration due to the usage of narrower calibration bounds in subsequent iterations the solution set of the final iteration is always better than the previous iterations the posterior distribution of calibrated parameter values from behavioral solutions is created to understand i the calibrated parameters spread pattern and position pn method used in this study defined in eq 4 below within the upper and lower calibration bounds and ii the change in statistical metrics mean median standard deviation skewness coefficient of variation confidence interval ci range inter quartile range iqr etc of parameter values across multiple model scenarios with the help of the statistical metrics or pn values scores the parameter uncertainty can be estimated for example the reduction in coefficient of variation her and chaubey 2015 or reduction in iqr rajib and merwade 2016 rajib et al 2016 shafii et al 2019 pfannerstill et al 2017 across multiple model scenarios would mean a reduction in parameter uncertainty we have used pn method in this study and then estimated the iqr based on rajib and merwade 2016 and rajib et al 2016 for comparing multiple parameter values under a common scale the parameter values were normalized so that the variations are restricted within a 0 100 score scale thus the normalized parameter uncertainty score pn was defined as 4 pn pb l l ul l l 100 where pb is the behavioral parameter value and ul and ll are the upper and lower limit of the parameter respectively rajib and merwade 2016 rajib et al 2016 note that pn is just a scoring technique that transforms the position of a calibrated parameter value within the calibration ranges upper and lower into a score number the iqr of the pn values scores for each of the key parameters were compared between model scenarios to evaluate the effect of modifications on parameter uncertainty fig 4 the prediction uncertainty could generally be quantified using multiple metrics such as containing ratio cr average bandwidth b average relative bandwidth rb average asymmetry degree average deviation amplitude p factor d factor and r factor yang et al 2008 xiong et al 2009 abbaspour et al 2007 abbaspour 2012 teweldebrhan et al 2018 the metric used varies with the calibration algorithm for example the cr index is extensively used for the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimator glue calibration algorithm similarly p factor and r factor are extensively used in the sufi 2 calibration algorithm based studies given their efficiency in estimating the model prediction uncertainty and due to usage of the sufi 2 algorithm for calibration in this study we chose p factor and r factor indices the p factor is defined as a fraction of the observed data for example streamflow bracketed by the 95 prediction uncertainty ppu band and the r factor is defined as the average thickness of 95 ppu band divided by the standard deviation of the observed data yang et al 2008 abbaspour 2012 for more details on the sufi 2 calibration algorithm p factor and r factor refer to abbaspour 2012 the p factor and r factor can vary between 0 and 1 and 0 and infinity respectively theoretically a p factor of 1 and r factor of 0 is a simulation that corresponds exactly to observed data higher p factor value and lower r factor value imply a lower prediction uncertainty ekstrand et al 2010 bouda et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 streamflow calibration and validation baseline scenario we calibrated the model from 1993 to 2002 and validated from 2003 to 2012 simultaneous calibration and validation were done using monthly streamflow data at all eight stations within the watershed the model performed well during the calibration and the validation periods both at the outlet of the watershed in the wapello station fig 2 a and all seven internal stations the metrics kge rsr and pbias varied between 0 74 and 0 87 0 42 to 0 68 and 13 7 to 8 6 respectively during the calibration period and between 0 43 and 0 85 0 49 to 0 92 and 25 9 to 8 7 respectively during the validation period table 1 and table s6 this scenario is hereafter referred to as the baseline scenario bs 3 2 crop yield performance evaluation baseline scenario the calibrated model baseline scenario was then used to estimate crop yield across the entire watershed the model underpredicted both corn and soybean yields fig 2 b and c figure s1 a and b with underestimation being greater for soybean compared to corn 26 underestimation of the mean yield for corn and 61 for soybean crop yields are generally low when there is water or temperature stress in the system on exploring model outputs it was identified that the corn hrus were under water stress on an average for 27 days out of the 150 day growing season between 1993 and 2012 while soybean hrus were under water stress on an average for 33 days out of the 150 day growing season fig 2 d and figure s1 c furthermore the water storage within the soil profile was below the field capacity and wilting point leading the system to water stress for the entire growing season fig 2 d and figure s1 c this explained the poor crop yield observed in the results and highlighted the need for adding crop yield as a calibration target 3 3 stepwise model refinement crop yield calibration scenario s1 in the next step of model refinement scenario s1 the annual corn and soybean yields at nine internal sub basins were added as calibration targets in addition to discharge crop specific parameters like maximum potential leaf area index blai heat units heat units plant radiation use efficiency bio e and harvest index hvsti were used for model calibration in addition to streamflow specific parameters table s1 this led to a slight improvement in crop yield but corn and soybean yield was still underpredicted by 27 and 52 respectively figure s2 b streamflow metrics were predicted with a similar level of accuracy as the baseline scenario table 1 and table s6 the crop water stress values and soil water content were also similar between the two scenarios figure s2 d and much higher than what is typically expected in a humid climate like iowa we hypothesize that this can be created by overestimation of potential evapotranspiration pet which would potentially lead to drying up of the soil contributing to water stress and reduced crop uptake of water this led us to consider alternate model formulations for the estimation of evapotranspiration as described in the next section the results of sensitivity analysis section s2 table s2 through s5 highlight that when crop yield is added as a calibration target the sensitivity to crop yield parameters like blai corn blai soyb heat units corn and heat units soyb increases table s3 this indicates that useful information is being added by including crop yield as a target 3 4 stepwise model refinement model structural changes improvement of evapotranspiration scenarios s2 and s2a due to its wide usage the pm pet method was used in the baseline and the s1 scenario schneider et al 2007 milly and dunne 2016 however the average annual pet estimated by the model 1516 mm seemed to be exceedingly high compared to estimated data in iowa during the same years green et al 2006 1190 mm daryl herzmann iowa environmental mesonet 2019 1175 mm to address this issue the temperature based hargreaves hg pet method was considered in the next step of model refinement scenario s2 with everything else being the same as scenario s1 this led to a significant improvement in crop yield figure s3 b and c with corn and soybean yield being underpredicted by only 2 and 9 respectively while the streamflow statistics kge and rsr improved slightly table 1 and table s6 potential evapotranspiration predicted by the hg method was lower than the pm method 963 mm compared to 1516 mm and the average water stress days for both corn and soybean hrus were reduced to zero days during the150 day growing season between 1993 and 2012 figure s3 d to quantify the relative contribution of this structural change in pet versus the effect of crop yield calibration we did another simulation scenario s2a which is the same as scenario s2 except there is no crop yield calibration the structural model change s2a led to a greater improvement in streamflow above the baseline scenario table 1 and table s6 than the crop yield calibration scenario s1 however consideration of both structural model change and crop yield calibration s2 led to the greatest improvement in both streamflow and crop yield table 1 table s6 and table 3 3 5 stepwise model refinement model structural changes improvement of flow partitioning scenarios s3 and s3a we then evaluated the effect of model refinement on the partitioning of water along the lateral flow pathways namely surface runoff lateral flow tile flow and groundwater flow although scenario s2 yielded acceptable model statistics for both crop yield and streamflow it led to the tile flow pathway contributing to only 17 of the total flow while surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow corresponded to 74 7 and 2 of the total flow respectively table 2 this highlights the serious underestimation of tile flow for a watershed that is 68 tile drained a review study conducted by howe and moore 2016 highlighted that the percent flow through tiles could range from 37 to 86 in north american watersheds while a study in a neighboring watershed reported a tile flow percent of 67 green et al 2006 thus the next stage of model refinement involved interrogating the variables responsible for flow partitioning it has been argued that the traditional curve number method in swat that uses soil moisture based curve number prediction icn 0 in swat manuals generates too much surface runoff in shallow soils kannan et al 2007 neitsch et al 2011 amatya and jha 2011 there exists an alternate evapotranspiration based curve number method in swat icn 1 that links the retention parameter s in cn with soil moisture depletion which in turn is governed by pet rainfall and runoff in this method it is possible to have control over the allocation of surface and subsurface flow through infiltration without affecting the et amatya and jha 2011 using the et based cn prediction method the cncoeff parameter was manually adjusted to achieve a tile flow of 67 similar to green et al 2006 and howe and moore 2016 table 2 also this scenario s3 was able to provide good streamflow fig 2 e and crop yield estimates fig 2 f and g figure s1 d and e we did an additional simulation scenario s3a to isolate the effect of crop yield calibration targets and flow partitioning constraints here we added flow partitioning constraints and used the hg pet model but did not calibrate for crop yield on comparing s3 and s3a we found s3a s streamflow metrics and flow through multiple pathways surface tile lateral and baseflow are comparable to s3 however s3 s crop yield metrics were better due to crop calibration thus the addition of crop yield calibration targets improved only the crop yield metrics while the inclusion of flow partitioning constraints improved flow partitioning table 2 while we did not have information on site specific flow partitioning metrics if available better estimates can be used to refine the model further for reasonable flow partitioning while still maintaining streamflow table 1 and table 7 and crop yield statistics table 3 3 6 model comparison sub basin scale crop yield improvements across the six scenarios analyzed in this paper bs s1 s2 s2a s3 and s3a the addition of crop yield and flow partitioning parameters led to some improvement in streamflow prediction table 1 and table s6 the biggest improvement however occurred in crop yield estimates where watershed scale pbias of corn decreased from 26 for the bs scenario to 3 in the s3 scenario and pbias of soybean decreased from 61 for the bs scenarios to 4 in the s3 scenario fig 2 b and f figure s1 a and d table 3 also the crop yield estimates for nine selected sub basins were considerably better for the s2 and s3 scenarios compared to the baseline and s1 scenarios table 3 due to the change in the representation of potential evapotranspiration in the model the crop yield estimates of s2a and s3a were poor due to no calibration of crop parameters in these scenarios since the model was calibrated for crop yield at only nine sub basins the ability of the model to describe spatial variations in crop yield for all 67 sub watersheds within the iowa cedar basin for bs s2 and s3 scenarios was evaluated further fig 3 note that the s2a and s3a scenarios were not included for this analysis since crop yield parameters were not calibrated for corn only 12 of the sub basins fell within the acceptable pbias window 10 to 10 for bs while 95 and 97 of the sub basins had acceptable pbias values for s2 and s3 scenarios respectively for soybean the results were more dramatic where no sub basins with acceptable pbias existed in the bs scenario while 51 and 78 of the sub basins had acceptable pbias values for the s2 and s3 scenarios respectively it is possible that further model refinement of swat s crop representation is needed for better performance for soybean 3 7 model performance evaluation parameter uncertainty the impact of model refinement bs vs s2 vs s3 on parameter uncertainty was evaluated by plotting the normalized uncertainty scores of the twelve parameters across all behavioral solutions 56 for bs 19 for s2 and 19 for s3 the fewer behavioral solutions arise in s2 and s3 because of the larger number of calibration targets which ensure that the parameter space is more tightly constrained than in the bs scenario we argue that this is what contributes to the hydrologic robustness of the s3 scenario a decrease increase in the interquartile range of the normalized uncertainty score indicates a decrease increase in uncertainty for the particular model scenario overall there is a reduction in uncertainty for most of the parameters between the bs and the s2 and s3 scenarios ch n2 sol z sol awc sol k esco epco alpha bf and gw revap indicating that model refinement successfully constrained the parameter space three of the parameters surlag gw delay and dep imp showed little difference in uncertainty between bs and s2 and s3 scenarios while the most dramatic increase in uncertainty between the bs s2 and s3 scenarios was apparent for cn2 the iqr of cn2 increased from 2 for the bs to 9for the s2 and 14 for the s3 scenarios fig 4 to understand this increase in uncertainty the magnitude of the cn2 parameter was explored between the bs and the s2 and s3 scenarios in the bs scenario the cn2 parameter is tightly constrained with the best value being equal to 94 a curve number magnitude that more closely represents urban areas with impervious land cover curve number 98 usda nrcs 2004 than agricultural areas that characterize the icb in contrast the best parameter value of cn2 under the s2 and s3 corresponds to cn2 values of 76 and 73 which is closer to curve number values that can be expected for this watershed given soil type and predominant land use based on usda nrcs 2004 the average runoff curve number value for soil hydrologic group b which covers 97 of agricultural lands in the study area and agricultural row crops under multiple residue cover treatments corresponds to 76 thus even though the bs scenario led to a more tightly constrained cn2 estimate it led to a hydrologically unrealistic estimate of cn2 the effects of our calibration on parameter uncertainty are somewhat mixed with only 50 of the parameters showing a decrease in uncertainty from bs to s2 while 58 of the parameters showed a decrease in uncertainty from s2 to s3 when comparing scenarios s2a and s3a with s2 and s3 reduction in parameter uncertainty was found in 75 and 83 of the parameters fig 4 respectively due to the presence of crop yield calibration targets in s2 and s3 to check the influence of flow partitioning constraints on parameter uncertainty s2a and s3a were compared s3a showed a reduction in parameter uncertainty only for 42 of parameters when compared with s2a note that both s2a and s3a are not calibrated for crop yield fig 4 while the impact of flow partitioning constraints on parameter uncertainty produced mixed results the inclusion of crop yield targets reduced parameter uncertainty for the majority of the parameters 3 8 prediction uncertainty and equifinality model refinement led to a decrease in prediction uncertainty specifically the p factor in model predictions decreased from 0 39 in bs to 0 26 in s2 and 0 31 in s3 while the r factor decreased from 0 44 in the bs scenario to 0 16 in s2 and 0 14 in s3 achieving a low r factor also reduces the p factor and thus there should be a reasonable trade off between these two factors yang et al 2008 ekstrand et al 2010 abbaspour 2012 bouda et al 2012 zuo et al 2015 the results indicate that while almost the same amount of observed streamflow variability is captured within the 95 ppu band for bs and s3 39 of observed data in bs versus 31 in s3 a narrower uncertainty band was achieved in scenario s3 compared to the baseline scenario 0 44 in bs compared to 0 14 in s3 table 4 we further found on comparing s2a and s3a scenarios with s2 and s3 scenarios respectively that crop yield calibration did not reduce the prediction uncertainty table 4 however s3a captured 3 more observed streamflow variability than s2a with a slightly narrower uncertainty band r factor thus prediction uncertainty was reduced in s3a when compared with s2a due to the inclusion of flow partitioning constraints this comparative analysis demonstrates that the inclusion of flow partitioning constraints in calibration reduced the prediction uncertainty while the inclusion of crop yield calibration targets did not table 4 overall s3 is considered to be better than all other scenarios due to i the higher p factor and lower r factor values and ii proper simulation of crop yield and flow through surface and subsurface pathways we further evaluated whether model improvement led to a reduction in equifinality by analyzing the simulations that led to the top 2 5 kge estimates behavioral solutions for bs s2 and s3 scenarios the analysis revealed that the bs had 56 behavioral solutions while s2 s2a s3 and s3a had 19 229 19 and 195 behavioral solutions respectively that fell within the top 2 5 kge threshold the reduction in the number of behavioral solutions in s2 and s3 due to the inclusion of additional crop yield and flow partitioning constraints indicates a reduction in the equifinality of the model simulations the choice of relative threshold number 2 5 is subjective an increase in this threshold would lead to a greater number of behavioral parameter solutions which in turn might increase the parameter uncertainty her et al 2019 the impact of relative threshold number and corresponding behavioral solutions on parameter and prediction uncertainty among the 4 model scenarios though interesting is beyond the scope of this study however we expect that the conclusion of reduction in prediction uncertainty for the s3 scenario compared to the bs scenario would still hold at different threshold values 3 9 model predictive ability at daily time scale our model was calibrated and validated at the monthly timescale to further evaluate the effect of developing a more hydrologically consistent model on streamflow statistics the ability of bs s2 and s3 scenarios to predict daily streamflow were estimated this is important since a model developed at the monthly timescale is not expected to describe daily streamflow statistics since the parameter values are calibrated to match the monthly flow values which could suppress the errors at the daily time step sudheer et al 2007 the bs and s2 scenarios were not able to capture the daily streamflow statistics table 5 and table s7 despite being able to describe the monthly streamflow table 1 and table s6 in contrast the s3 scenario showed good statistics kge 0 73 and 0 66 rsr 0 69 and 0 80 during the calibration and validation periods table 5 and table s7 the improvement achieved in the s3 scenario is also clearly visible in the daily hydrographs fig 5 the daily streamflow statistics for the s2a and s3a scenarios were however similar to the corresponding s2 and s3 scenarios this indicates that crop yield calibration didn t improve the daily streamflow but flow partitioning did table 5 table s7 fig 5 despite being calibrated at a monthly timescale the fact that the daily streamflow statistics are captured effectively highlights how creating a more hydrologically consistent model s3 allowed it to be more robust even at a timescale at which it was not expected to perform well improvement in daily streamflow statistics from s2 and s3 can be attributed primarily to a more robust description of the subsurface flow partitioning in s3 a substantial increase in flow through the subsurface pathway 88 of total water yield was achieved due to the change of the flow partitioning method and this led to an improvement in the daily streamflow statistics 3 10 model predictive ability for nitrogen fluxes the ability of the model to predict annual nitrate loads without any calibration was also evaluated the bs and s2 scenario showed significant underprediction pbias 61 for bs and 28 for s2 of nitrate loads whereas pbias was only equal to 10 for s3 fig 6 without any calibration the improved ability of the s2 scenario over the bs scenario is attributed to crop yield calibration while the improvement achieved in the s3 scenario is attributed to both improved crop yield and appropriate flow partitioning a comparison of s2a with the s3a scenario indicates that flow partitioning was more important than crop yield calibration for nitrate loads fig 6 in s3 more water is diverted to the subsurface flow pathway that accesses nitrogen stores leading to a more appropriate representation of nitrate fluxes this again highlights that increasing the consistency of hydrology models increases their predictive ability even for uncalibrated parameters 4 summary and conclusions the overall objective of our study was to quantify the value of ancillary data such as crop yield and flow partitioning information in increasing the robustness of hydrologic models by the proper representation of internal watershed processes to achieve this objective we first calibrated a swat model in a large 32 660 km2 agricultural basin in iowa the model was able to reproduce very well the monthly streamflow statistics at eight stations within the watershed however when the crop yield estimates from the model were compared with available crop yield data from the agricultural census the model severely underestimated crop yield pbias corn 26 and pbias soybean 61 this low crop yield was the product of a landscape where the soil water content was low and the corn and soybean crops were water stressed for long durations a diagnostic model evaluation allowed us to identify high potential evapotranspiration pet estimated by the most commonly used penman monteith method to be the underlying cause of the model deficiency altering the pet method to the hargreaves method and adding crop yield as a calibration target decreased the pet and thus led to excellent crop yield statistics pbias corn 2 and pbias soybean 9 while not altering the streamflow statistics considerably although pm pet is the most commonly used pet formulation in hydrologic models schneider et al 2007 earls and dixon 2008 a recent study has shown that they lead to consistent overestimation milly and dunne 2016 and alternate methods like the hargreaves makkink and priestley taylor pet methods can often lead to more reasonable estimates wang et al 2006 schneider et al 2007 earls and dixon 2008 sperna weiland et al 2012 tadesse et al 2016 samadi 2016 what is interesting is that despite such an overestimation of pet the model was able to capture the discharge statistics adequately by reducing the actual evapotranspiration to realistic values by allowing the crops to die such that actual evapotranspiration and thus streamflow is almost unchanged between the scenarios a classic example of getting the right streamflow but for the wrong reasons we also evaluated the effect of the partitioning of flow between the surface and subsurface flow pathways on model robustness changing the flow partitioning method in swat from the traditional soil moisture based curve number method to the evapotranspiration based curve number method contributed to 67 of the flow to be transmitted through the tiled pathway in contrast to 17 observed in the traditional method the watershed is heavily tile drained 68 and 67 is a more realistic flow partitioning magnitude increasing the consistency of the hydrological model by incorporating crop yield information and soft data on flow partitioning had multiple benefits first the inclusion of crop yield calibration targets in the calibration has reduced the parameter uncertainty while the inclusion of flow partitioning constraints has reduced the prediction uncertainty second the modified model proved to be superior in predicting daily flows despite being calibrated at the monthly timescale finally increasing the hydrologic consistency of the model increased its ability to predict nitrate fluxes without any calibration the study highlights the value of using soft data and ancillary datasets like crop yield information to improve the consistency of hydrologic and biogeochemical models with crop data from both remotely sensed observations and agricultural census being more easily accessible agricultural system models like swat should routinely start using these data sources to enhance model
