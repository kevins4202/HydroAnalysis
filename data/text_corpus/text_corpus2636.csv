13180,black titanium dioxide was synthesized from sol gel tio2 by a chemical reduction method using solid state nabh4 for use in photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange dye under both uv and visible light irradiations a 2 2 3 factorial experimental design with two replicates was used to assess the significance of a calcination temperature b calcination time and c molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 used black titanium dioxide that was calcined at 500 c for 10 h and with a molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 of 1 1 exhibited the highest removal percentage of methyl orange under both uv and visible light 82 17 and 71 92 respectively because it contained the largest amount of surface defects ti3 sites and oxygen vacancies as suggested by xps evidences the surface defects acted as an electron trap and retarded the electron hole recombination furthermore the band gap energy of black tio2 catalyst became narrower enabling degradation under visible light statistical analysis indicated that out of the three main effects factor c had the biggest impact on the photocatalytic activity the analysis also revealed significant interactions between the amount of nabh4 used and either calcination time or temperature graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords black tio2 dye removal photocatalysis defect engineering factorial design 1 introduction azo dyes present a dangerous environmental problem because of their toxicity and resistance to biodegradation 1 one of the promising methods for the removal of azo dyes from wastewater is heterogenous photocatalysis which because of no formation of toxic intermediates quick degradation process under almost ambient condition and oxidation of very low concentration of dye i e ppb level 2 titanium dioxide tio2 has been the most studied photocatalyst for the removal of organic pollutants due to its good long term stability low cost non toxicity and most importantly good photocatalytic activity 3 tio2 has been investigated for the photocatalytic degradation of azo dyes in aqueous solution 4 nonetheless the drawback of tio2 photocatalysis is its inability to utilize light in the visible region which contributes about half of the solar energy spectrum this is due to its rather wide band gap energy of 3 2 ev 5 therefore its application under visible or solar light is somewhat limited one way to improve the photocatalytic activity of tio2 under visible light irradiation is to form reduced tio2 x catalyst 6 synthesis of black titanium dioxide nanocrystals was first reported by chen and coworkers 7 tio2 was converted to black tio2 via hydrogenation at 200 c in a high pressure chamber the resulting hydrogenated tio2 comprised a crystalline tio2 core and a highly disordered surface layer the surface layer contained a great amount of defects leading to the formation of band tail states in both the conduction and valence bands of tio2 consequently a dramatic enhancement of light absorption in the visible region was observed 7 8 surface defects in the forms of either ti3 or oxygen vacancies give rise to enhanced photocatalytic activity 9 the black coloration of titanium dioxide was attributed to the presence of defect states e g oxygen vacancies 10 therefore black titanium dioxide has exhibited very good photocatalytic activities toward the decomposition of organic pollutant and the generation of hydrogen gas from water without the requirement of cocatalyst 11 12 besides hydrogen treatment methods above 7 8 10 other techniques can be employed to produce black tio2 including chemical reduction electrochemical reduction chemical oxidation and anodization annealing 13 14 the chemical reduction method converts regular tio2 to black tio2 using a reducing agent sodium borohydride nabh4 is the commonly used reducing agent that was chosen for this study because of its reducing capability to convert ti4 to ti3 to a greater extent with the chemical reduction method the risk of explosion can be minimized compared to the technique of hydrogenation at high temperature 15 in previous studies titanium dioxide that was prepared by acid hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide exhibited high photocatalytic activity toward ethylene oxidation 16 the sol gel tio2 is converted to black titanium dioxide via a chemical reduction by solid state nabh4 instead of nabh4 solution previously reported 13 15 in this study a preliminary effort to optimize the preparation parameters for black tio2 was attempted a 2 2 3 factorial experimental design was employed to investigate the effect and the interactions of three parameters in the synthesis of catalyst namely calcination temperature and calcination time at two levels each and molar ratio of reducing agent nabh4 used to tio2 at three levels the responses were the removal percentage of methyl orange under both uv and visible light irradiations after 4 h a 2 2 3 factorial experimental design was chosen over a typical 23 full factorial design so as to compare the properties of white tio2 and black tio2 for a factorial design the factors of interest are varied simultaneously over a set of planned experiments the main advantage of this optimization process is in obtaining the maximum amount of information with the fewest number of experiments required 17 18 with this method one determines not only the main effect of the three factors but also their interactions without a factorial experimental design the factors of interest are typically varied one at a time while the others constant are kept constant this experimental design neglects the possible effect of interactions between factor therefore an optimization cannot be achieved properly 18 it should be noted that for the model with more details the second order model such central composite design or box behnken design can be employed with more experimental runs 19 20 2 material and methods 2 1 synthesis of titanium dioxide titanium dioxide was synthesized by a sol gel method previously described 16 the chemicals used in the synthesis included titanium tetra isopropoxide ti och ch3 2 4 97 nitric acid hno3 70 sodium borohydride nabh4 99 and ethanol c2h5oh 99 5 all chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich missouri usa first titanium tetra isopropoxide ttip was added to a solution of 70 nitric acid in deionized di water at the volume ratio of ttip di water hno3 of 1 12 0 087 after ttip was added white precipitate formed instantaneously the mixture was stirred for 2 3 days until a clear sol was obtained then the sol was dialyzed in cellulose membranes with a molecular weight cutoff of 3500 distilled water used in dialysis was changed daily until a ph of sol reached approximately 3 5 finally the sol was dried at 100 c overnight to obtain the xerogel which was then ground the resultant tio2 powder was calcined at either 400 or 500 c for either 5 or 10 h in air the four products were denoted by the calcination temperature and time as t400 5 t500 5 t400 10 and t500 10 as seen in table 1 2 2 synthesis of black titanium dioxide typically 3 g of tio2 nanopowder obtained from section 2 1 was mixed with 0 0 71 and 1 42 g of solid state nabh4 to achieve the molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 of 0 1 0 5 1 and 1 1 respectively the solid mixture was ground thoroughly in a mortar for at least 30 min then the mixture was placed in a porcelain boat and calcined at either 400 or 500 c with a heating rate of 10 c min for 5 or 10 h under nitrogen atmosphere these black tio2 photocatalysts underwent the same calcination protocols as their corresponding white tio2 precursor for the second time for example bt400 5 0 5 catalyst was calcined at 400 c for 5 h for the second time after being mixed with solid state nabh4 after cooling down to room temperature the resultant black tio2 powder was washed with deionized water and ethanol repeatedly to remove the remaining unreacted nabh4 and then dried at 70 c eight black titanium dioxide catalysts were synthesized according to the condition listed in table 1 i e catalysts with prefix bt the last number in the name corresponds to the molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 used in the synthesis the catalyst was synthesized twice at the same conditions to obtain two replicates for use in a statistical analysis to be explained later 2 3 characterization techniques tio2 was characterized by several analytical techniques x ray diffractometry xrd was performed with a radiation source of cukα at λ 1 5418 ǻ and a scan rate of 0 50 min 1 in the 2θ range between 20 and 80 using siemens d5000 bet specific surface area of the catalyst was measured using micromeritics asap 2020 surface area analyzer x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was executed by kratos amicus esca 3400 with alkα x ray source the uv visible diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples were obtained in the wavelength range of 200 to 800 nm with a step size of 1 nm using perkin elmer lambda 650 spectrophotometer photoluminescence pl measurement was carried out in a horiba fluoromax spectrofluorometer using a xenon lamp as the excitation source at room temperature it was scanned in the range of 350 600 nm using an excitation wavelength of 325 nm more details on the operation of some techniques can be found in the literature 19 21 2 4 photocatalytic experiments the photocatalytic activity of tio2 was measured for the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange under both uv and visible light irradiations initially 400 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 400 ml of an aqueous solution containing 10 mg l of methyl orange mo inside an annular reactor the light source was either a 75 w philips uv c lamp with light intensity of 0 044 w m2 in uv region or an 18 w philips tl d standard color lamp with light intensity of 0 291 w m2 in visible region which was placed axially in the center inside a glass tube the suspension was stirred in the absence of light for 1 h to achieve an adsorption equilibrium of methyl orange on the surface adsorption experiments of methyl orange on tio2 were carried out so as to determine the appropriate time for the dark adsorption period and a period of 1 h was chosen the concentrations of methyl orange before and after the dark adsorption period were measured and recorded at the end of dark adsorption period the photocatalytic post adsorption experiment began by exposing the mixture to either uv or visible light irradiation for 180 min in every 15 min 5 ml of the solution was extracted in order to determine the concentration of methyl orange using a uv visible spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 464 nm the removal percentage η was calculated as follows 1 η c 0 c t c 0 100 where η is the removal percentage of methyl orange from the photocatalytic reaction c0 and ct are the initial concentration of methyl orange and the concentration at different irradiation time respectively 2 5 factorial experimental design a 2 2 3 factorial experimental design was employed to investigate the effect of three parameters involved in the synthesis of black tio2 on the removal percentage of methyl orange for the photocatalytic degradation under uv and visible light irradiations the three factors selected for this study were calcination temperature factor a calcination time factor b and the molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 used during the reduction factor c two levels of calcination temperature factors a were selected namely 400 and 500 c and two levels of calcination time factor b were chosen namely 5 and 10 h however three levels of the molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 factor c were chosen at 0 1 0 5 1 and 1 1 there were 12 possible factorial points for this design in this study two replicates were performed at each factorial point resulting in a total of 24 batches of tio2 photocatalyst being synthesized table 1s lists the names of all photocatalysts along with their levels of synthesis parameters tio2 photocatalysts were employed in the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange under uv and visible light irradiations separately therefore a total of 48 experiments were carried out the response of interest was the removal of methyl orange after 240 min of experiment which comprised 60 min of dark adsorption period and 180 min of photocatalytic degradation minitab release 19 was used to assess the significance of the main effect of the three factors and their interactions using the analysis of variance anova 3 results and discussion 3 1 phase analysis xrd x ray diffractometry xrd was employed to determine the phase structure of tio2 in the photocatalyst twelve tio2 photocatalysts were classified into four groups according to the different calcination temperature and time as listed in table 1 their xrd patterns are presented in fig 1 there are four white tio2 catalysts a d g and j and eight black tio2 catalysts that were synthesized by the nabh4 reduction process using different molar ratios of nabh4 to tio2 0 5 1 and 1 1 the characteristic diffraction peaks of anatase tio2 at 2θ values of 25 3 37 9 48 1 53 8 62 9 69 0 and 75 3 were observed in four white tio2 samples a d g and j diffraction peaks associated with rutile marked as and brookite marked as were detected albeit in small amounts typically anatase tio2 was produced from a sol gel method but brookite was also observed when synthesized under acidic medium 22 23 the presence of brookite in black tio2 samples prepared by chemical reduction by solid state nabh4 was also reported by liu et al 24 the strong peaks observed in white tio2 samples indicated high crystallinity of tio2 25 nonetheless the xrd pattern of black tio2 possessed different characteristic peaks when compared to its white tio2 precursor the xrd peaks in black tio2 samples appeared weakened and widened this is attributed to active hydrogen generated from nabh4 decomposition during the reduction process attacking the long range ordering tio2 crystal and brought about an amorphous layer surrounding crystalline core 24 26 as a result defects or oxygen vacancies were created at the surface of tio2 27 increases in calcination temperature calcination time and the amount of reducing agent led to greater weakening and widening of main diffraction peaks thereby suggesting more defects or oxygen vacancies being created 26 the phase composition of tio2 polymorphs i e anatase rutile and brookite was calculated from the integrated intensities of xrd peaks associated with each polymorph using the following equations 26 2 w a k a i a k a i a i r k b i b 3 w r i r k a i a i r k b i b 4 w a k b i b k a i a i r k b i b where wa wr wb are weight fractions of anatase rutile and brookite tio2 respectively ia ir ib are the intensities of anatase 101 rutile 110 and brookite 121 peaks respectively ka is the coefficient for anatase i e 0 886 and kb is the coefficient for brookite i e 2 721 the average crystallite size of anatase tio2 was calculated from the full width of anatase 101 peak at half maximum intensity or β using the scherrer equation where d is the average crystallite size nm k is the scherrer constant i e 0 90 λ is the x ray wavelength for cukα 17 5 d kλ βcos θ the phase composition of tio2 catalysts and their crystallite sizes are displayed in table 2 scherer equation was used to calculate the crystallite size when the calcination temperature for white tio2 was raised from 400 to 500 c anatase phase was transformed into rutile phase because rutile is favored thermodynamically and the crystallites grew larger 29 our data is consistent with the face that the critical crystallite size for the phase transformation from anatase tio2 to rutile is about 13 15 nm 30 the presence of anatase phase was also reduced when the calcination time was increased from 5 to 10 h because of the phase transformation to rutile and the agglomeration of nanoparticles 26 furthermore the transformation from anatase to rutile can proceed directly a r or via brookite as intermediate a b r 28 the weight fraction of brookite wb became larger as a result of a decline in wa and no noticeable rise in wr when the amount of nabh4 used was increased as seen in table 2 suggested that the phase transition from anatase to rutile in our study proceeded from anatase to brookite to rutile eventually 30 3 2 bet specific surface area nitrogen adsorption isotherm was obtained to determine bet specific surface area total pore volume and average pore size of various tio2 and black tio2 nanoparticles and the results are listed in table 3 when the calcination temperature was raised from 400 to 500 c the specific surface area of tio2 catalysts decreased as a result of crystal growth and sintering between and inside tio2 aggregates 26 similar explanation applied when the calcination time was raised from 5 to 10 h during the tio2 reduction process the thermal decomposition of nabh4 occurred and the active hydrogen was released to create defect or oxygen vacancy sites on the surface of tio2 27 the shell of amorphous phase was formed around the crystalline tio2 to produce the structure of crystalline core amorphous shell at a higher calcination temperature i e 500 c more active hydrogen was released and gave rise to more disordered mesoporous structure hence thicker amorphous shell 25 similarly the disordered shell became thicker when the calcination time was extended and the molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 was increased 31 consequently a large amount of amorphous shell structure filled up the gap between the crystalline core and clogged the pore structure leading to a decrease in specific surface area due to the prevention of n2 molecule from accessing the pores 32 3 3 uv visible diffuse reflectance spectra uv visible diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained in the range of 200 to 800 nm to determine the optical absorption properties and to calculate the band gap energy from fig 2 white tio2 a d g and j possessed good absorption in uv region 420 nm but hardly any absorption in the visible region 420 700 nm on the other hand the light absorption of black tio2 was significantly improved in the visible light region this is caused by the high concentration of defect forming band tail states extending beyond the conduction band edge of tio2 resulting in the narrowing of the energy gap between the bands 7 33 increases in calcination temperature and time gave rise to better light absorption in the visible region hence higher photocatalytic activity 31 33 the improvement in light absorption of tio2 was attributed to the narrowing of the band gap the band gap energies of white and black tio2 were determined using data from uv visible spectra to plot the kubelka munk function against photon energy the band gap energy of various tio2 catalysts is reported in table 3 the band gap of tio2 became narrower when the amount of nabh4 was increased when tio2 was reduced the gap between its conduction and valence bands was shortened by ca 0 25 0 33 ev because the defects or oxygen vacancies in black tio2 created additional electronic states around 0 75 1 18 ev below the conduction band edge at an energy level enabling the absorption in visible light region 33 35 36 as a consequence the photo excitation of electrons from valence band edge to the conduction band edge became easier bringing about an improvement of the photocatalytic degradation efficiency bt500 10 1 photocatalyst possessed the narrowest band gap energy 1 70 ev owing to the most abundant ti3 defects and oxygen vacancies 3 4 xps analysis x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was employed to investigate the chemical states of ti and o on the surface of tio2 photocatalysts xps spectra of ti signals for a series of tio2 catalysts that were calcined at 500 c for 5 h are shown in fig 3 the negative shift in binding energy for ti4 2p1 2 signal from 464 3 to 464 1 ev and 2p3 2 signal from 458 6 to 458 4 ev indicated the formation of ti3 defects on the surface 37 38 fig 4 displays xps spectra for bt500 10 1 catalyst where the peaks were deconvoluted to reveal the characteristic peaks of titanium and oxygen in various states from fig 4a the peaks around 458 7 and 464 6 ev corresponded to ti4 o bonds of ti4 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 respectively whereas the peaks around 456 6 and 460 4 ev corresponded to the presence of ti3 defects 25 37 the o 1s spectra see fig 4b consisted of two peaks that were associated with the lattice oxygen ol or tio bonds at 530 2 ev and oxygen vacancies ov or a hydroxyl group oh around 532 0 ev 31 table 4 presents the deconvoluted peak areas of ti3 and ti4 signals and the associating area ratio of ti3 to ti4 this ratio corresponded to the extent of tio2 reduction furthermore the percentage of peak areas of lattice oxygen and oxygen vacancies for all catalysts were also reported they were another indicator of the amount of defects i e oxygen vacancies present in tio2 is shown during reduction nabh4 decomposed and generated active hydrogen which later attacked lattice oxygen in tio2 as a result either ti3 was created in tio2 lattice or oxygen vacancies was formed depending on the destination of excess electrons from the reaction 27 so an increase in the amount of nabh4 used in otherwise similar calcination conditions gave rise to the greater amount of both ti3 defects and oxygen vacancies 27 36 this increasing trend was observed for both the peak area ratio of ti3 to ti4 and the percentage of peak areas oxygen vacancies within all 4 groups of tio2 that underwent the same calcination temperature and time see table 4 moreover the reduction of tio2 by nabh4 at a higher temperature of 500 c promoted the diffusion of the bulk ti3 defects toward the subsurface of tio2 since more energy was supplied to the active hydrogen to react with the crystal surface of tio2 34 from table 4 one could rank tio2 that contained the amount of ti3 and oxygen vacancies from the smallest to the largest amount as follows t500 10 t400 10 t500 5 t400 5 bt400 5 0 5 bt400 10 0 5 bt400 5 1 bt500 10 0 5 bt500 5 0 5 bt500 5 1 bt400 10 1 bt500 10 1 consequently black tio2 that was synthesized at the highest calcination temperature and for the longest time with the greatest amount of reducing agent in this study bt500 10 1 possessed the largest amount of ti3 and oxygen vacancies these defects had the beneficial effect on the photocatalytic activity of tio2 because of its ability to serve as electron traps to separate photogenerated electron hole pairs and retard the charge recombination 33 3 5 photoluminescence spectroscopy photoluminescence spectroscopy pl spectra was performed to assess the recombination behavior of electrons and holes in both white and black tio2 photocatalysts the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes had an adverse effect on the photocatalytic activity of tio2 since faster recombination prevented active charge carriers to participate in the reaction 27 fig 5 displays the pl spectra of tio2 photocatalysts in the wavelength range of 350 600 nm using an excitation wavelength of 325 nm the small peaks observed in the wavelength range from 440 to 500 nm were excitonic pl resulting from oxygen vacancies and defects on tio2 surface 39 40 the intensity of pl signals corresponded to the recombination rate of electrons and holes the higher intensity indicated faster recombination of charge carriers 39 the peak intensities for black tio2 were lower than those of white tio2 suggesting that the recombination of electron hole pairs were suppressed in black tio2 the intensity of pl peaks for black tio2 that employed a larger amount of reducing agent became even lower because of the formation of more defects or hydroxyl species oh in the disordered tio2 shell which can act as electron traps and o2 binding sites 39 consequently the photocatalytic activity of black tio2 was enhanced due to more efficient electron hole separation on the surface terminal sites the order of tio2 photocatalysts with the fastest electron hole recombination rate i e the highest pl intensities to the slowest was similar to the order of tio2 with the smallest amount of defects to the highest see xps results in section 3 4 3 6 photocatalytic activity for methyl orange degradation the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange began with an experiment in the absence of light for 1 h to attain the adsorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and the dye the reactor was then exposed to either uv or visible light irradiations for another 3 h comparelli et al 41 proposed two different mechanisms in the degradation of methyl orange by tio2 photocatalysis the first one involved hemolytic cleavage of nitrogen carbon bond of the amine group in the dye followed by a methyl group being replaced by a hydrogen atom the second mechanism was the attack of hydroxyl group on the benzene ring 3 6 1 photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange under uv light irradiation the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange mo under uv light irradiation was performed to investigate the activities of tio2 catalysts that were calcined at 400 c group i and ii series and 500 c group iii and iv series a blank experiment was performed without any catalyst in the reactor and the mo removal percentage from photolysis alone was negligible lower than 5 the removal percentages of methyl orange from tio2 photocatalysts after 4 h of photocatalytic post adsorption experiments are listed in table 5 figs 6s a and 6s b displays the removal percentage of methyl orange for photocatalytic degradation over tio2 photocatalysts which were calcined at 400 c and 500 c respectively the plotted data points represent the average between the values obtained from two batches of photocatalysts that underwent the same synthesis condition i e replicates the width of the error bar corresponds to the difference between the two values in the same group i through iv of tio2 photocatalysts i e same calcination temperature and time black tio2 exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity than its white tio2 counterpart did moreover when the amount of reducing agent used was increased the photocatalytic activities rose higher this is due to more defects i e ti3 and oxygen vacancies being created 35 37 the order of increasing photocatalytic activities of tio2 under uv light is listed as follows t500 10 t400 10 t500 5 t400 5 bt400 5 0 5 bt400 10 0 5 bt400 5 1 bt500 10 0 5 bt500 5 0 5 bt500 5 1 bt400 10 1 bt500 10 1 this sequence was in a complete agreement with the trends in increasing peak area ratio of ti3 ti4 and oxygen vacancies see table 4 and decreasing photoluminescence signals see fig 5 this indicated that these catalysts possessed more electron traps to separate photogenerated electrons and holes during the photocatalytic degradation process and retard the charge recombination leading to higher photocatalytic activities 35 37 black tio2 catalysts that were calcined at 500 c exhibited higher photocatalytic activities than those that were calcined at 400 c because they contained greater amount of surface defects or oxygen vacancies which acted as the charge carrier traps as well as adsorption sites 42 similarly an increase in calcination time promoted formation of disordered layer of tio2 hence higher photocatalytic activities 23 29 from table 5 bt500 10 1 exhibited the largest removal percentage of methyl orange at 82 17 from photocatalytic degradation post adsorption for 4 h i e 60 min of dark adsorption followed by 180 min of degradation under uv irradiation this catalyst was synthesized using the highest calcination temperature the longest calcination time and the largest amount of reducing agent under these conditions the largest amount of surface defects was created and it had the key role to promote the charge transfer to the surface of the catalyst and also facilitated the efficient separation of electron hole pairs during the photocatalytic process 23 29 32 33 35 36 3 6 2 photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange under visible light irradiation the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange mo under visible light irradiation was performed to investigate the activities of tio2 catalysts that were calcined at 400 c group i and ii series and 500 c group iii and iv series without any catalyst in the reactor the mo removal percentage from photolysis alone was negligible lower than 3 table 5 also reported the removal percentage of methyl orange under visible light from tio2 photocatalysts after 4 h of photocatalytic degradation post adsorption experiment figs 6s c and 6s d present the removal percentage of methyl orange from photocatalytic degradation post adsorption under visible light irradiation over tio2 catalysts that were calcined at 400 and 500 c similar trends in the activities of tio2 photocatalysts in the same series were observed for the degradation under visible light irradiation as in uv light experiments however the photocatalytic activity under visible light was lower than the activity of the same catalyst under uv light irradiation because visible light contained photons with lower energy 3 0 ev and the visible light source produced lower light intensity due to lower wattage of the bulb the narrow band gap of black tio2 which was 0 25 0 33 ev narrower than that of white tio2 lent itself to the harvest of photon energy from visible light source 7 8 this is evident from inspection of uv visible diffuse reflectance spectra in fig 2 consequently visible light could bring about the excitation of electrons from valence band to conduction band of tio2 while this activation hardly happened in white tio2 similar to the results under uv light irradiation bt500 10 1 exhibited the largest mo removal percentage at 71 92 from 4 h of photocatalytic activity post adsorption experiment bt500 10 1 showed the best absorption in the visible light region see fig 2 and exhibited the slowest recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes according to photoluminescence result see fig 5 presence of the most abundant surface defects and oxygen vacancies in bt500 10 1 suppressed the recombination of charge carriers resulting in the highest photocatalytic activity 23 29 32 33 35 36 3 6 3 stability of photocatalyst after repeated usage in order to assess the stability of bt500 10 1 which was the best photocatalyst in our study the photocatalyst was employed in the methyl orange degradation repeatedly after each run the spent catalyst was separated from the dye solution by using a centrifuge then the catalyst was washed with water and was dried at 110 c overnight before use in the next run fig 6 shows the removal of methyl orange via photocatalytic degradation under uv and visible light irradiations over bt500 10 1 photocatalyst after 5 repeated usage the decline in the photocatalytic activity of bt500 10 1 catalyst was barely noticeable the removal efficiency of methyl orange dropped from 69 9 in the first cycle to 67 1 in the fifth cycle under 2 h of uv irradiation time and the mo removal efficiency dropped from 52 5 to 50 5 under 2 h of visible light irradiation time bt500 10 1 photocatalyst appeared to be very stable for repeated usage 3 7 factorial experimental design and analysis of variance a 2 2 3 factorial experimental design was employed to investigate the effect of three factors involved in the tio2 catalyst preparation parameters on the removal of methyl orange in the photocatalytic degradation post adsorption under uv and visible light irradiations the selected three factors that were used in the synthesis of black tio2 were calcination temperature factor a calcination time factor b and the molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 factor c the levels of the three factors chosen for this study are listed in table 1s two replicates were performed at each of the 12 possible factorial points resulting in a total of 24 batches of tio2 photocatalyst being synthesized these photocatalysts were employed in the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange under uv and visible light irradiations so a total of 48 experiments were carried out the response of interest was the removal percentage of methyl orange after being subject to 4 h of photocatalytic degradation post adsorption the statistical model for this design is displayed below 6 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β 12 x 1 x 2 β 13 x 1 x 3 β 23 x 2 x 3 β 123 x 1 x 2 x 3 ε where y denotes the response xi denotes the coded variables for factors a b c see table 1s and βi denotes the regression coefficients for main effects and interactions minitab release 16 was used to assess the significance of the main effects and their interactions using the analysis of variance anova and the results are summarized in tables 6 and 7 according to the p values in table 6 the main effect of the three factors i e a b and c possessed p values noticeably less than the significance level of α 0 05 therefore calcination temperature calcination time and molar ratio of reducing agent had significant effects on the removal percentage of methyl orange under uv light irradiation 43 44 when higher order interactions were considered the two interactions involving the molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 i e a c and b c were deemed statistically significant inspection of residual plots see fig 6s did not reveal serious violation of the assumption σ2 nid 0 σ2 45 table 6s a presents the regression coefficients for factors with significant effect at α 0 05 inspection of table 6s a reveals that an increase in any of the three factors had a positive effect on the response and the amount of nabh4 used exerted the biggest influence on the removal percentage of methyl orange two way interactions a c and b c had negative effects on the response indicating that simultaneous increases in the two factors lowered the mo removal percentage 17 analysis of variance anova for a 2 2 3 factorial design with two replicates did not provide sufficient degrees of freedom to distinguish lack of fit error from pure error however when insignificant interactions in the model i e ab and abc were disregarded the result from minitab was displayed in table 6s b with p 0 05 the lack of fit error was not significant for the photocatalytic degradation post adsorption of methyl orange under visible light irradiation see table 7 all main effects and two way interactions of the three factors were significant at α 0 05 only the three way interaction was determined to be insignificant 43 44 inspection of residual plots see fig 7s did not reveal serious violation of the assumption σ2 nid 0 σ2 45 similar to the experiments under uv light irradiation all three factors had positive effects on the mo removal percentage under visible light irradiation with the amount of nabh4 used having the biggest impact as shown in table 7s a negative values of the two way interaction effects indicated that increasing any two of the three factors at the same time decreased the mo removal percentage under visible light irradiation furthermore when the insignificant interaction a b c was omitted from the model the lack of fit error was insignificant with p 0 05 45 4 conclusions in summary black tio2 catalysts were successfully prepared from tio2 that was synthesized by a sol gel method tio2 was converted to black tio2 by chemical reduction with solid state nabh4 increases in calcination temperature calcination time and amount of reducing agent used in the synthesis gave rise to an increase in the amount of ti3 defects in black tio2 catalyst as seen in xps evidences as a result black tio2 possessed a narrower band gap leading to good light absorption in the visible light region and retarded the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes under both uv and visible light irradiations black tio2 exhibited a superior photocatalytic activity than its white tio2 counterpart the order of increasing photocatalytic activities for the methyl orange degradation reaction of tio2 catalyst under both light conditions agreed with the characterization results from photoluminescence spectroscopy uv visible spectrophotometry and xps using a 2 2 3 factorial design one produced black tio2 that was calcined at 500 c for 10 h with the molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 of 1 1 exhibited the best photocatalytic activities at 82 17 and 71 92 under uv and visible light irradiation respectively statistical analysis of the experimental data revealed that calcination temperature calcination time and molar ratio of reducing agent to catalyst were found to significantly affect the photocatalytic performance of black tio2 the factor with the biggest impact was the amount of nabh4 to tio2 used

13180,black titanium dioxide was synthesized from sol gel tio2 by a chemical reduction method using solid state nabh4 for use in photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange dye under both uv and visible light irradiations a 2 2 3 factorial experimental design with two replicates was used to assess the significance of a calcination temperature b calcination time and c molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 used black titanium dioxide that was calcined at 500 c for 10 h and with a molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 of 1 1 exhibited the highest removal percentage of methyl orange under both uv and visible light 82 17 and 71 92 respectively because it contained the largest amount of surface defects ti3 sites and oxygen vacancies as suggested by xps evidences the surface defects acted as an electron trap and retarded the electron hole recombination furthermore the band gap energy of black tio2 catalyst became narrower enabling degradation under visible light statistical analysis indicated that out of the three main effects factor c had the biggest impact on the photocatalytic activity the analysis also revealed significant interactions between the amount of nabh4 used and either calcination time or temperature graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords black tio2 dye removal photocatalysis defect engineering factorial design 1 introduction azo dyes present a dangerous environmental problem because of their toxicity and resistance to biodegradation 1 one of the promising methods for the removal of azo dyes from wastewater is heterogenous photocatalysis which because of no formation of toxic intermediates quick degradation process under almost ambient condition and oxidation of very low concentration of dye i e ppb level 2 titanium dioxide tio2 has been the most studied photocatalyst for the removal of organic pollutants due to its good long term stability low cost non toxicity and most importantly good photocatalytic activity 3 tio2 has been investigated for the photocatalytic degradation of azo dyes in aqueous solution 4 nonetheless the drawback of tio2 photocatalysis is its inability to utilize light in the visible region which contributes about half of the solar energy spectrum this is due to its rather wide band gap energy of 3 2 ev 5 therefore its application under visible or solar light is somewhat limited one way to improve the photocatalytic activity of tio2 under visible light irradiation is to form reduced tio2 x catalyst 6 synthesis of black titanium dioxide nanocrystals was first reported by chen and coworkers 7 tio2 was converted to black tio2 via hydrogenation at 200 c in a high pressure chamber the resulting hydrogenated tio2 comprised a crystalline tio2 core and a highly disordered surface layer the surface layer contained a great amount of defects leading to the formation of band tail states in both the conduction and valence bands of tio2 consequently a dramatic enhancement of light absorption in the visible region was observed 7 8 surface defects in the forms of either ti3 or oxygen vacancies give rise to enhanced photocatalytic activity 9 the black coloration of titanium dioxide was attributed to the presence of defect states e g oxygen vacancies 10 therefore black titanium dioxide has exhibited very good photocatalytic activities toward the decomposition of organic pollutant and the generation of hydrogen gas from water without the requirement of cocatalyst 11 12 besides hydrogen treatment methods above 7 8 10 other techniques can be employed to produce black tio2 including chemical reduction electrochemical reduction chemical oxidation and anodization annealing 13 14 the chemical reduction method converts regular tio2 to black tio2 using a reducing agent sodium borohydride nabh4 is the commonly used reducing agent that was chosen for this study because of its reducing capability to convert ti4 to ti3 to a greater extent with the chemical reduction method the risk of explosion can be minimized compared to the technique of hydrogenation at high temperature 15 in previous studies titanium dioxide that was prepared by acid hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide exhibited high photocatalytic activity toward ethylene oxidation 16 the sol gel tio2 is converted to black titanium dioxide via a chemical reduction by solid state nabh4 instead of nabh4 solution previously reported 13 15 in this study a preliminary effort to optimize the preparation parameters for black tio2 was attempted a 2 2 3 factorial experimental design was employed to investigate the effect and the interactions of three parameters in the synthesis of catalyst namely calcination temperature and calcination time at two levels each and molar ratio of reducing agent nabh4 used to tio2 at three levels the responses were the removal percentage of methyl orange under both uv and visible light irradiations after 4 h a 2 2 3 factorial experimental design was chosen over a typical 23 full factorial design so as to compare the properties of white tio2 and black tio2 for a factorial design the factors of interest are varied simultaneously over a set of planned experiments the main advantage of this optimization process is in obtaining the maximum amount of information with the fewest number of experiments required 17 18 with this method one determines not only the main effect of the three factors but also their interactions without a factorial experimental design the factors of interest are typically varied one at a time while the others constant are kept constant this experimental design neglects the possible effect of interactions between factor therefore an optimization cannot be achieved properly 18 it should be noted that for the model with more details the second order model such central composite design or box behnken design can be employed with more experimental runs 19 20 2 material and methods 2 1 synthesis of titanium dioxide titanium dioxide was synthesized by a sol gel method previously described 16 the chemicals used in the synthesis included titanium tetra isopropoxide ti och ch3 2 4 97 nitric acid hno3 70 sodium borohydride nabh4 99 and ethanol c2h5oh 99 5 all chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich missouri usa first titanium tetra isopropoxide ttip was added to a solution of 70 nitric acid in deionized di water at the volume ratio of ttip di water hno3 of 1 12 0 087 after ttip was added white precipitate formed instantaneously the mixture was stirred for 2 3 days until a clear sol was obtained then the sol was dialyzed in cellulose membranes with a molecular weight cutoff of 3500 distilled water used in dialysis was changed daily until a ph of sol reached approximately 3 5 finally the sol was dried at 100 c overnight to obtain the xerogel which was then ground the resultant tio2 powder was calcined at either 400 or 500 c for either 5 or 10 h in air the four products were denoted by the calcination temperature and time as t400 5 t500 5 t400 10 and t500 10 as seen in table 1 2 2 synthesis of black titanium dioxide typically 3 g of tio2 nanopowder obtained from section 2 1 was mixed with 0 0 71 and 1 42 g of solid state nabh4 to achieve the molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 of 0 1 0 5 1 and 1 1 respectively the solid mixture was ground thoroughly in a mortar for at least 30 min then the mixture was placed in a porcelain boat and calcined at either 400 or 500 c with a heating rate of 10 c min for 5 or 10 h under nitrogen atmosphere these black tio2 photocatalysts underwent the same calcination protocols as their corresponding white tio2 precursor for the second time for example bt400 5 0 5 catalyst was calcined at 400 c for 5 h for the second time after being mixed with solid state nabh4 after cooling down to room temperature the resultant black tio2 powder was washed with deionized water and ethanol repeatedly to remove the remaining unreacted nabh4 and then dried at 70 c eight black titanium dioxide catalysts were synthesized according to the condition listed in table 1 i e catalysts with prefix bt the last number in the name corresponds to the molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 used in the synthesis the catalyst was synthesized twice at the same conditions to obtain two replicates for use in a statistical analysis to be explained later 2 3 characterization techniques tio2 was characterized by several analytical techniques x ray diffractometry xrd was performed with a radiation source of cukα at λ 1 5418 ǻ and a scan rate of 0 50 min 1 in the 2θ range between 20 and 80 using siemens d5000 bet specific surface area of the catalyst was measured using micromeritics asap 2020 surface area analyzer x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was executed by kratos amicus esca 3400 with alkα x ray source the uv visible diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples were obtained in the wavelength range of 200 to 800 nm with a step size of 1 nm using perkin elmer lambda 650 spectrophotometer photoluminescence pl measurement was carried out in a horiba fluoromax spectrofluorometer using a xenon lamp as the excitation source at room temperature it was scanned in the range of 350 600 nm using an excitation wavelength of 325 nm more details on the operation of some techniques can be found in the literature 19 21 2 4 photocatalytic experiments the photocatalytic activity of tio2 was measured for the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange under both uv and visible light irradiations initially 400 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 400 ml of an aqueous solution containing 10 mg l of methyl orange mo inside an annular reactor the light source was either a 75 w philips uv c lamp with light intensity of 0 044 w m2 in uv region or an 18 w philips tl d standard color lamp with light intensity of 0 291 w m2 in visible region which was placed axially in the center inside a glass tube the suspension was stirred in the absence of light for 1 h to achieve an adsorption equilibrium of methyl orange on the surface adsorption experiments of methyl orange on tio2 were carried out so as to determine the appropriate time for the dark adsorption period and a period of 1 h was chosen the concentrations of methyl orange before and after the dark adsorption period were measured and recorded at the end of dark adsorption period the photocatalytic post adsorption experiment began by exposing the mixture to either uv or visible light irradiation for 180 min in every 15 min 5 ml of the solution was extracted in order to determine the concentration of methyl orange using a uv visible spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 464 nm the removal percentage η was calculated as follows 1 η c 0 c t c 0 100 where η is the removal percentage of methyl orange from the photocatalytic reaction c0 and ct are the initial concentration of methyl orange and the concentration at different irradiation time respectively 2 5 factorial experimental design a 2 2 3 factorial experimental design was employed to investigate the effect of three parameters involved in the synthesis of black tio2 on the removal percentage of methyl orange for the photocatalytic degradation under uv and visible light irradiations the three factors selected for this study were calcination temperature factor a calcination time factor b and the molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 used during the reduction factor c two levels of calcination temperature factors a were selected namely 400 and 500 c and two levels of calcination time factor b were chosen namely 5 and 10 h however three levels of the molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 factor c were chosen at 0 1 0 5 1 and 1 1 there were 12 possible factorial points for this design in this study two replicates were performed at each factorial point resulting in a total of 24 batches of tio2 photocatalyst being synthesized table 1s lists the names of all photocatalysts along with their levels of synthesis parameters tio2 photocatalysts were employed in the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange under uv and visible light irradiations separately therefore a total of 48 experiments were carried out the response of interest was the removal of methyl orange after 240 min of experiment which comprised 60 min of dark adsorption period and 180 min of photocatalytic degradation minitab release 19 was used to assess the significance of the main effect of the three factors and their interactions using the analysis of variance anova 3 results and discussion 3 1 phase analysis xrd x ray diffractometry xrd was employed to determine the phase structure of tio2 in the photocatalyst twelve tio2 photocatalysts were classified into four groups according to the different calcination temperature and time as listed in table 1 their xrd patterns are presented in fig 1 there are four white tio2 catalysts a d g and j and eight black tio2 catalysts that were synthesized by the nabh4 reduction process using different molar ratios of nabh4 to tio2 0 5 1 and 1 1 the characteristic diffraction peaks of anatase tio2 at 2θ values of 25 3 37 9 48 1 53 8 62 9 69 0 and 75 3 were observed in four white tio2 samples a d g and j diffraction peaks associated with rutile marked as and brookite marked as were detected albeit in small amounts typically anatase tio2 was produced from a sol gel method but brookite was also observed when synthesized under acidic medium 22 23 the presence of brookite in black tio2 samples prepared by chemical reduction by solid state nabh4 was also reported by liu et al 24 the strong peaks observed in white tio2 samples indicated high crystallinity of tio2 25 nonetheless the xrd pattern of black tio2 possessed different characteristic peaks when compared to its white tio2 precursor the xrd peaks in black tio2 samples appeared weakened and widened this is attributed to active hydrogen generated from nabh4 decomposition during the reduction process attacking the long range ordering tio2 crystal and brought about an amorphous layer surrounding crystalline core 24 26 as a result defects or oxygen vacancies were created at the surface of tio2 27 increases in calcination temperature calcination time and the amount of reducing agent led to greater weakening and widening of main diffraction peaks thereby suggesting more defects or oxygen vacancies being created 26 the phase composition of tio2 polymorphs i e anatase rutile and brookite was calculated from the integrated intensities of xrd peaks associated with each polymorph using the following equations 26 2 w a k a i a k a i a i r k b i b 3 w r i r k a i a i r k b i b 4 w a k b i b k a i a i r k b i b where wa wr wb are weight fractions of anatase rutile and brookite tio2 respectively ia ir ib are the intensities of anatase 101 rutile 110 and brookite 121 peaks respectively ka is the coefficient for anatase i e 0 886 and kb is the coefficient for brookite i e 2 721 the average crystallite size of anatase tio2 was calculated from the full width of anatase 101 peak at half maximum intensity or β using the scherrer equation where d is the average crystallite size nm k is the scherrer constant i e 0 90 λ is the x ray wavelength for cukα 17 5 d kλ βcos θ the phase composition of tio2 catalysts and their crystallite sizes are displayed in table 2 scherer equation was used to calculate the crystallite size when the calcination temperature for white tio2 was raised from 400 to 500 c anatase phase was transformed into rutile phase because rutile is favored thermodynamically and the crystallites grew larger 29 our data is consistent with the face that the critical crystallite size for the phase transformation from anatase tio2 to rutile is about 13 15 nm 30 the presence of anatase phase was also reduced when the calcination time was increased from 5 to 10 h because of the phase transformation to rutile and the agglomeration of nanoparticles 26 furthermore the transformation from anatase to rutile can proceed directly a r or via brookite as intermediate a b r 28 the weight fraction of brookite wb became larger as a result of a decline in wa and no noticeable rise in wr when the amount of nabh4 used was increased as seen in table 2 suggested that the phase transition from anatase to rutile in our study proceeded from anatase to brookite to rutile eventually 30 3 2 bet specific surface area nitrogen adsorption isotherm was obtained to determine bet specific surface area total pore volume and average pore size of various tio2 and black tio2 nanoparticles and the results are listed in table 3 when the calcination temperature was raised from 400 to 500 c the specific surface area of tio2 catalysts decreased as a result of crystal growth and sintering between and inside tio2 aggregates 26 similar explanation applied when the calcination time was raised from 5 to 10 h during the tio2 reduction process the thermal decomposition of nabh4 occurred and the active hydrogen was released to create defect or oxygen vacancy sites on the surface of tio2 27 the shell of amorphous phase was formed around the crystalline tio2 to produce the structure of crystalline core amorphous shell at a higher calcination temperature i e 500 c more active hydrogen was released and gave rise to more disordered mesoporous structure hence thicker amorphous shell 25 similarly the disordered shell became thicker when the calcination time was extended and the molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 was increased 31 consequently a large amount of amorphous shell structure filled up the gap between the crystalline core and clogged the pore structure leading to a decrease in specific surface area due to the prevention of n2 molecule from accessing the pores 32 3 3 uv visible diffuse reflectance spectra uv visible diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained in the range of 200 to 800 nm to determine the optical absorption properties and to calculate the band gap energy from fig 2 white tio2 a d g and j possessed good absorption in uv region 420 nm but hardly any absorption in the visible region 420 700 nm on the other hand the light absorption of black tio2 was significantly improved in the visible light region this is caused by the high concentration of defect forming band tail states extending beyond the conduction band edge of tio2 resulting in the narrowing of the energy gap between the bands 7 33 increases in calcination temperature and time gave rise to better light absorption in the visible region hence higher photocatalytic activity 31 33 the improvement in light absorption of tio2 was attributed to the narrowing of the band gap the band gap energies of white and black tio2 were determined using data from uv visible spectra to plot the kubelka munk function against photon energy the band gap energy of various tio2 catalysts is reported in table 3 the band gap of tio2 became narrower when the amount of nabh4 was increased when tio2 was reduced the gap between its conduction and valence bands was shortened by ca 0 25 0 33 ev because the defects or oxygen vacancies in black tio2 created additional electronic states around 0 75 1 18 ev below the conduction band edge at an energy level enabling the absorption in visible light region 33 35 36 as a consequence the photo excitation of electrons from valence band edge to the conduction band edge became easier bringing about an improvement of the photocatalytic degradation efficiency bt500 10 1 photocatalyst possessed the narrowest band gap energy 1 70 ev owing to the most abundant ti3 defects and oxygen vacancies 3 4 xps analysis x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was employed to investigate the chemical states of ti and o on the surface of tio2 photocatalysts xps spectra of ti signals for a series of tio2 catalysts that were calcined at 500 c for 5 h are shown in fig 3 the negative shift in binding energy for ti4 2p1 2 signal from 464 3 to 464 1 ev and 2p3 2 signal from 458 6 to 458 4 ev indicated the formation of ti3 defects on the surface 37 38 fig 4 displays xps spectra for bt500 10 1 catalyst where the peaks were deconvoluted to reveal the characteristic peaks of titanium and oxygen in various states from fig 4a the peaks around 458 7 and 464 6 ev corresponded to ti4 o bonds of ti4 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 respectively whereas the peaks around 456 6 and 460 4 ev corresponded to the presence of ti3 defects 25 37 the o 1s spectra see fig 4b consisted of two peaks that were associated with the lattice oxygen ol or tio bonds at 530 2 ev and oxygen vacancies ov or a hydroxyl group oh around 532 0 ev 31 table 4 presents the deconvoluted peak areas of ti3 and ti4 signals and the associating area ratio of ti3 to ti4 this ratio corresponded to the extent of tio2 reduction furthermore the percentage of peak areas of lattice oxygen and oxygen vacancies for all catalysts were also reported they were another indicator of the amount of defects i e oxygen vacancies present in tio2 is shown during reduction nabh4 decomposed and generated active hydrogen which later attacked lattice oxygen in tio2 as a result either ti3 was created in tio2 lattice or oxygen vacancies was formed depending on the destination of excess electrons from the reaction 27 so an increase in the amount of nabh4 used in otherwise similar calcination conditions gave rise to the greater amount of both ti3 defects and oxygen vacancies 27 36 this increasing trend was observed for both the peak area ratio of ti3 to ti4 and the percentage of peak areas oxygen vacancies within all 4 groups of tio2 that underwent the same calcination temperature and time see table 4 moreover the reduction of tio2 by nabh4 at a higher temperature of 500 c promoted the diffusion of the bulk ti3 defects toward the subsurface of tio2 since more energy was supplied to the active hydrogen to react with the crystal surface of tio2 34 from table 4 one could rank tio2 that contained the amount of ti3 and oxygen vacancies from the smallest to the largest amount as follows t500 10 t400 10 t500 5 t400 5 bt400 5 0 5 bt400 10 0 5 bt400 5 1 bt500 10 0 5 bt500 5 0 5 bt500 5 1 bt400 10 1 bt500 10 1 consequently black tio2 that was synthesized at the highest calcination temperature and for the longest time with the greatest amount of reducing agent in this study bt500 10 1 possessed the largest amount of ti3 and oxygen vacancies these defects had the beneficial effect on the photocatalytic activity of tio2 because of its ability to serve as electron traps to separate photogenerated electron hole pairs and retard the charge recombination 33 3 5 photoluminescence spectroscopy photoluminescence spectroscopy pl spectra was performed to assess the recombination behavior of electrons and holes in both white and black tio2 photocatalysts the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes had an adverse effect on the photocatalytic activity of tio2 since faster recombination prevented active charge carriers to participate in the reaction 27 fig 5 displays the pl spectra of tio2 photocatalysts in the wavelength range of 350 600 nm using an excitation wavelength of 325 nm the small peaks observed in the wavelength range from 440 to 500 nm were excitonic pl resulting from oxygen vacancies and defects on tio2 surface 39 40 the intensity of pl signals corresponded to the recombination rate of electrons and holes the higher intensity indicated faster recombination of charge carriers 39 the peak intensities for black tio2 were lower than those of white tio2 suggesting that the recombination of electron hole pairs were suppressed in black tio2 the intensity of pl peaks for black tio2 that employed a larger amount of reducing agent became even lower because of the formation of more defects or hydroxyl species oh in the disordered tio2 shell which can act as electron traps and o2 binding sites 39 consequently the photocatalytic activity of black tio2 was enhanced due to more efficient electron hole separation on the surface terminal sites the order of tio2 photocatalysts with the fastest electron hole recombination rate i e the highest pl intensities to the slowest was similar to the order of tio2 with the smallest amount of defects to the highest see xps results in section 3 4 3 6 photocatalytic activity for methyl orange degradation the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange began with an experiment in the absence of light for 1 h to attain the adsorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst and the dye the reactor was then exposed to either uv or visible light irradiations for another 3 h comparelli et al 41 proposed two different mechanisms in the degradation of methyl orange by tio2 photocatalysis the first one involved hemolytic cleavage of nitrogen carbon bond of the amine group in the dye followed by a methyl group being replaced by a hydrogen atom the second mechanism was the attack of hydroxyl group on the benzene ring 3 6 1 photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange under uv light irradiation the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange mo under uv light irradiation was performed to investigate the activities of tio2 catalysts that were calcined at 400 c group i and ii series and 500 c group iii and iv series a blank experiment was performed without any catalyst in the reactor and the mo removal percentage from photolysis alone was negligible lower than 5 the removal percentages of methyl orange from tio2 photocatalysts after 4 h of photocatalytic post adsorption experiments are listed in table 5 figs 6s a and 6s b displays the removal percentage of methyl orange for photocatalytic degradation over tio2 photocatalysts which were calcined at 400 c and 500 c respectively the plotted data points represent the average between the values obtained from two batches of photocatalysts that underwent the same synthesis condition i e replicates the width of the error bar corresponds to the difference between the two values in the same group i through iv of tio2 photocatalysts i e same calcination temperature and time black tio2 exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity than its white tio2 counterpart did moreover when the amount of reducing agent used was increased the photocatalytic activities rose higher this is due to more defects i e ti3 and oxygen vacancies being created 35 37 the order of increasing photocatalytic activities of tio2 under uv light is listed as follows t500 10 t400 10 t500 5 t400 5 bt400 5 0 5 bt400 10 0 5 bt400 5 1 bt500 10 0 5 bt500 5 0 5 bt500 5 1 bt400 10 1 bt500 10 1 this sequence was in a complete agreement with the trends in increasing peak area ratio of ti3 ti4 and oxygen vacancies see table 4 and decreasing photoluminescence signals see fig 5 this indicated that these catalysts possessed more electron traps to separate photogenerated electrons and holes during the photocatalytic degradation process and retard the charge recombination leading to higher photocatalytic activities 35 37 black tio2 catalysts that were calcined at 500 c exhibited higher photocatalytic activities than those that were calcined at 400 c because they contained greater amount of surface defects or oxygen vacancies which acted as the charge carrier traps as well as adsorption sites 42 similarly an increase in calcination time promoted formation of disordered layer of tio2 hence higher photocatalytic activities 23 29 from table 5 bt500 10 1 exhibited the largest removal percentage of methyl orange at 82 17 from photocatalytic degradation post adsorption for 4 h i e 60 min of dark adsorption followed by 180 min of degradation under uv irradiation this catalyst was synthesized using the highest calcination temperature the longest calcination time and the largest amount of reducing agent under these conditions the largest amount of surface defects was created and it had the key role to promote the charge transfer to the surface of the catalyst and also facilitated the efficient separation of electron hole pairs during the photocatalytic process 23 29 32 33 35 36 3 6 2 photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange under visible light irradiation the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange mo under visible light irradiation was performed to investigate the activities of tio2 catalysts that were calcined at 400 c group i and ii series and 500 c group iii and iv series without any catalyst in the reactor the mo removal percentage from photolysis alone was negligible lower than 3 table 5 also reported the removal percentage of methyl orange under visible light from tio2 photocatalysts after 4 h of photocatalytic degradation post adsorption experiment figs 6s c and 6s d present the removal percentage of methyl orange from photocatalytic degradation post adsorption under visible light irradiation over tio2 catalysts that were calcined at 400 and 500 c similar trends in the activities of tio2 photocatalysts in the same series were observed for the degradation under visible light irradiation as in uv light experiments however the photocatalytic activity under visible light was lower than the activity of the same catalyst under uv light irradiation because visible light contained photons with lower energy 3 0 ev and the visible light source produced lower light intensity due to lower wattage of the bulb the narrow band gap of black tio2 which was 0 25 0 33 ev narrower than that of white tio2 lent itself to the harvest of photon energy from visible light source 7 8 this is evident from inspection of uv visible diffuse reflectance spectra in fig 2 consequently visible light could bring about the excitation of electrons from valence band to conduction band of tio2 while this activation hardly happened in white tio2 similar to the results under uv light irradiation bt500 10 1 exhibited the largest mo removal percentage at 71 92 from 4 h of photocatalytic activity post adsorption experiment bt500 10 1 showed the best absorption in the visible light region see fig 2 and exhibited the slowest recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes according to photoluminescence result see fig 5 presence of the most abundant surface defects and oxygen vacancies in bt500 10 1 suppressed the recombination of charge carriers resulting in the highest photocatalytic activity 23 29 32 33 35 36 3 6 3 stability of photocatalyst after repeated usage in order to assess the stability of bt500 10 1 which was the best photocatalyst in our study the photocatalyst was employed in the methyl orange degradation repeatedly after each run the spent catalyst was separated from the dye solution by using a centrifuge then the catalyst was washed with water and was dried at 110 c overnight before use in the next run fig 6 shows the removal of methyl orange via photocatalytic degradation under uv and visible light irradiations over bt500 10 1 photocatalyst after 5 repeated usage the decline in the photocatalytic activity of bt500 10 1 catalyst was barely noticeable the removal efficiency of methyl orange dropped from 69 9 in the first cycle to 67 1 in the fifth cycle under 2 h of uv irradiation time and the mo removal efficiency dropped from 52 5 to 50 5 under 2 h of visible light irradiation time bt500 10 1 photocatalyst appeared to be very stable for repeated usage 3 7 factorial experimental design and analysis of variance a 2 2 3 factorial experimental design was employed to investigate the effect of three factors involved in the tio2 catalyst preparation parameters on the removal of methyl orange in the photocatalytic degradation post adsorption under uv and visible light irradiations the selected three factors that were used in the synthesis of black tio2 were calcination temperature factor a calcination time factor b and the molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 factor c the levels of the three factors chosen for this study are listed in table 1s two replicates were performed at each of the 12 possible factorial points resulting in a total of 24 batches of tio2 photocatalyst being synthesized these photocatalysts were employed in the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange under uv and visible light irradiations so a total of 48 experiments were carried out the response of interest was the removal percentage of methyl orange after being subject to 4 h of photocatalytic degradation post adsorption the statistical model for this design is displayed below 6 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β 12 x 1 x 2 β 13 x 1 x 3 β 23 x 2 x 3 β 123 x 1 x 2 x 3 ε where y denotes the response xi denotes the coded variables for factors a b c see table 1s and βi denotes the regression coefficients for main effects and interactions minitab release 16 was used to assess the significance of the main effects and their interactions using the analysis of variance anova and the results are summarized in tables 6 and 7 according to the p values in table 6 the main effect of the three factors i e a b and c possessed p values noticeably less than the significance level of α 0 05 therefore calcination temperature calcination time and molar ratio of reducing agent had significant effects on the removal percentage of methyl orange under uv light irradiation 43 44 when higher order interactions were considered the two interactions involving the molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 i e a c and b c were deemed statistically significant inspection of residual plots see fig 6s did not reveal serious violation of the assumption σ2 nid 0 σ2 45 table 6s a presents the regression coefficients for factors with significant effect at α 0 05 inspection of table 6s a reveals that an increase in any of the three factors had a positive effect on the response and the amount of nabh4 used exerted the biggest influence on the removal percentage of methyl orange two way interactions a c and b c had negative effects on the response indicating that simultaneous increases in the two factors lowered the mo removal percentage 17 analysis of variance anova for a 2 2 3 factorial design with two replicates did not provide sufficient degrees of freedom to distinguish lack of fit error from pure error however when insignificant interactions in the model i e ab and abc were disregarded the result from minitab was displayed in table 6s b with p 0 05 the lack of fit error was not significant for the photocatalytic degradation post adsorption of methyl orange under visible light irradiation see table 7 all main effects and two way interactions of the three factors were significant at α 0 05 only the three way interaction was determined to be insignificant 43 44 inspection of residual plots see fig 7s did not reveal serious violation of the assumption σ2 nid 0 σ2 45 similar to the experiments under uv light irradiation all three factors had positive effects on the mo removal percentage under visible light irradiation with the amount of nabh4 used having the biggest impact as shown in table 7s a negative values of the two way interaction effects indicated that increasing any two of the three factors at the same time decreased the mo removal percentage under visible light irradiation furthermore when the insignificant interaction a b c was omitted from the model the lack of fit error was insignificant with p 0 05 45 4 conclusions in summary black tio2 catalysts were successfully prepared from tio2 that was synthesized by a sol gel method tio2 was converted to black tio2 by chemical reduction with solid state nabh4 increases in calcination temperature calcination time and amount of reducing agent used in the synthesis gave rise to an increase in the amount of ti3 defects in black tio2 catalyst as seen in xps evidences as a result black tio2 possessed a narrower band gap leading to good light absorption in the visible light region and retarded the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes under both uv and visible light irradiations black tio2 exhibited a superior photocatalytic activity than its white tio2 counterpart the order of increasing photocatalytic activities for the methyl orange degradation reaction of tio2 catalyst under both light conditions agreed with the characterization results from photoluminescence spectroscopy uv visible spectrophotometry and xps using a 2 2 3 factorial design one produced black tio2 that was calcined at 500 c for 10 h with the molar ratio of nabh4 to tio2 of 1 1 exhibited the best photocatalytic activities at 82 17 and 71 92 under uv and visible light irradiation respectively statistical analysis of the experimental data revealed that calcination temperature calcination time and molar ratio of reducing agent to catalyst were found to significantly affect the photocatalytic performance of black tio2 the factor with the biggest impact was the amount of nabh4 to tio2 used during reduction the analysis also indicated significant interactions in preparation parameters which would be useful in the next phase of study declaration of competing interest the authors declare

13181,traditional wastewater treatment methods are often insufficient in the case of mature landfill leachate therefore novel methods are in demand recently internal microelectrolysis ime has been recognized as an effective method besides aops for refractory wastewaters treatment this study investigated the efficiency of a novel combined three step process ime o3 oh h2o2 applied to mature landfill leachate treatment waste iron chips and granulated activated carbon gac from nut shells were used in the process ozone was applied in doses from 0 28 to 1 4 g dm3 and the mass ratios of cod h2o2 were as follows 1 0 1 0 5 1 1 1 1 5 and 1 2 results showed that the pc is a reasonable pretreatment process before ime however cod and toc removal was up to 22 4 and 37 9 respectively it required no additional reagents before ime acidification is needed the best total cod removal in the ime process was for fe gac ratio 20 80 g g in 1 dm3 76 7 studies on the sorption process on gac showed a significant share in the ime process 11 2 62 6 of total cod removal that was an important observation since most other authors ignored the fact of sorption for optimal parameters of the o3 oh h2o2 total cod removal was 95 4 the values of toc absorbance uv254 and color were highly reduced by 91 2 94 7 and 98 2 respectively additionally biodegradability has been significantly improved up to 0 36 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aops internal micro electrolysis ime landfill leachate oxidation processes ozonation 1 introduction the chemical characteristic of landfill leachate ll depends strongly on the age of the landfill it is observed that in the case of young or not stabilized leachate 2 years organic compounds with relatively low molecular mass dominate such leachate is characterized by high total organic carbon toc chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and bod5 cod ratio above 0 4 1 on the contrary the old or stabilized leachate contains a high molecular mass of organics humic substances hs it has lower toc cod bod5 values and bod5 cod ratio contains compounds that are hazardous and resistant to biological treatment the more detailed characteristics of ll at different ages are presented in supplementary data table 1s that is why there is a need to apply powerful chemical methods to ll purification in most publications authors denote processes that could be used in the industry such as coagulation flocculation adsorption membrane methods and biological treatment in the case of leachate from mature municipal landfills those methods are insufficient because they do not remove all hazardous substances examples of compounds harmful to humans and the environment that remain in leachate after being treated by those methods are mainly petroleum hydrocarbons phthalates esters siloxanes and phenols 2 in recent years internal microelectrolysis ime has been extensively investigated for different industrial wastewaters treatment 3 6 when a mixture of iron anode and carbon cathode particles are mixed and in contact with each other in an acidic electrolyte many microscopic galvanic cells are formed the process occurs due to the difference in redox potential between fe and c microelectrodes 0 44 v it could be described by the following reactions eqs 1 and 2 1 7 8 iron anode oxidation 1 fe fe 2 2e carbon cathode reduction 2 2h aq 2e 2 h h 2 g when the process is conducted with active aeration the mechanism is different in this case the oxygen atom acts as an electron acceptor and competes with hydrogen as a result h2o2 is generated in situ according to the reactions below eqs 3 5 3 o 2 g 4h aq 4e 2h 2 o 4 o 2 g 4h aq 2e 2h 2 o 2 5 o 2 g 2h 2 o 4e aq 4oh aq subsequently h2o2 reacts with ferrous ions released from iron scraps which initiates the fenton s reaction eq 6 6 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh there are few publications about the treatment of landfill leachate by the ime process 9 14 and three of them deal with the best reactor parameters for conducting the process 10 11 13 for optimal process parameters 55 72 g dm3 fe c in a ratio of 3 1 and 12 32 g dm3 h2o2 ph 3 12 wang et al 13 obtained 74 59 reduction in cod and the ratio bod5 cod was 0 5 the other model of the reactor was proposed by ying et al 10 11 internal microelectrolysis ime was carried out in three ways without aeration with full aeration and as a combined process in one sime reactor experimental data showed that combined processes gave the best cod removal 73 7 1 3 which was higher than single processes by 15 2 and 24 8 with and without aeration respectively when the sequencing bath interior microelectrolysis reactor sime was in continuous mode the cod removal was higher and equaled 86 1 10 two publications concerned treatment ll membrane concentrate 12 14 for ll nanofiltration concentrate after coagulation with pac coupled with ime process huang et al 12 achieved removal efficiency for cod and toc 79 2 and 79 6 respectively for h2o2 0 75 mm and 2 h of retention time song et al 14 applied the ime process to treat reverse osmosis ro effluent and they achieved cod removal efficiency of 86 9 for gac fe 717 143 8 surface area ratio ph 3 8 and 1687 6 mg l h2o2 most cited authors used the rsm response surface methodology method to optimize operating variables there is only one paper in which the authors tried to optimize the ime process in laboratory experiments zhang et al 9 applied ime followed by the fenton process they achieved 60 0 cod removal efficiency after 90 min of ime and 105 min of the fenton process it is noteworthy that none of the cited authors mentioned the problem of precipitation of hs at low ph values which is supposed to be crucial in the case of mature landfill leachate in which hs is present in high quantities the solubility of hs depends strongly on ph 15 for the first time the separation of hs from acidified leachate was proposed by us as a modification of the fenton process preliminary coagulation pc 16 17 which significantly contributes to the final efficiency of the conventional fenton process industrial wastewater has usually been treated by integrating processes however in most cases physicochemical or biological methods have been combined with chemical processes and it seems reasonable to combine chemical processes based on different oxidation mechanisms among chemical methods which could be easily integrated with the ime process are advanced oxidation processes aops aops are a group of techniques based on hydroxyl radicals ho generation the hydroxyl radicals with the exception of fluorine are one of the most active oxidants known the most common aops processes are summarized in table 1 based on the available literature data of all aop methods used in the treatment of leachate 18 19 the most popular ones were fenton also fenton like and ozone based processes 16 20 21 the efficiency of the modified fenton process after acidification to ph 3 and sediment separation under optimum conditions has been proven to be very effective in cod removal 89 2 16 naumczyk et al 20 achieved similar results the efficiency of 120 min of m fenton process was higher than the efficiency obtained for either o3 h2o2 or h2o2 uv processes and reached 92 7 cod removal and bod5 cod ratio increased from 0 23 to 0 43 optimal dose of h2o2 fe ii was estimated to be 3500 150 mg l the most commonly used modification of the fenton process has been the additional application of uv radiation silva et al 21 successfully designed a photo fenton plant for the treatment of biologically oxidized landfill leachate he identified that cod could be decreased by photo fenton reaction by 57 80 80 225 mm h2o2 and 20 67 kj l accumulated uv energy on the other hand haapea et al 22 studied the treatment of industrial landfill leachates by chemical and biological methods such as ozonation ozonation with h2o2 h2o2 with biological post treatment for ozonated water cod and toc removal were 50 0 respectively by only using ozone 0 5 mg o3 mg cod at ph 10 after adding h2o2 to the leachate 3 2 mol h2o2 mol o3 cod and toc reduction were 37 20 respectively and the combination of ozone with biological treatment ph 9 5 0 3 mg o3 mg cod cod and toc were removed by 70 and 85 respectively wang et al 23 studied the oxidation of mature landfill leachate with o3 only and o3 h2o2 the maximum bod5 increase was about 110 for o3 h2o2 treatment and about 141 for o3 only treatment as the used ozone dose increased nh3 n and alkalinity decreased considerably and nitrite nitrate increased accordingly huang et al 24 used catalytic ozonation using activated carbon as a catalyst for advanced treatment of biologically treated landfill leachate the maximum cod removal reached 89 87 under the optimal conditions research on the ozonation after the fenton process for treating different landfill leachates was carried out by azis and abu amr 25 application of ozone treatment after the fenton process allowed for the cod color and ammonia nitrogen removal up to 87 100 and 22 respectively optimum doses of fe2 2800 mg l and h2o2 1700 mg l although the application of different aops methods alone or combined with physicochemical or biological methods for landfill leachate treatment has been widely discussed in the literature to the author s best knowledge there is no paper dealing with the combination of ime process with aops that s why in the presented study the authors focused on the concept of combining the ime process with the o3 oh h2o2 process additionally in the presented research the ime o3 oh h2o2 process was preceded with the pc which has never been applied before the ime process by other authors the main aims of the presented studies were the assessment of the treatment efficiency of the novel combined ime o3 oh h2o2 process for mature landfill leachate from a landfill site in poland the optimization of the preliminary coagulation pc applied before the ime o3 oh h2o2 process the optimization of the ime o3 oh h2o2 process on each step internal micro electrolysis ime and ozonation at ph 9 0 with different doses of h2o2 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection ll samples were collected from an old municipal landfill located near warsaw poland after collection samples were refrigerated at 4 c until analysis before each series of experiments ll was subjected to the initial 1 h sedimentation and the supernatant was separated by decantation all experiments with raw ll were conducted within 72 h of the sample collection most of the experiments were carried out in 3 4 repetitions 2 2 treatment processes 2 2 1 preliminary coagulation process preliminary coagulation process pc was conducted in 1 dm3 imhoff s funnels ph was adjusted to proper values of 2 3 4 and 5 with 10 m sulfuric vi acid the effectiveness of the pc process was assessed based on the cod value of supernatant and volume of sediment after 4 h sedimentation of precipitated hs for the process conducted under optimal conditions the effectiveness of the process was additionally assessed based on toc and uv254 absorbance changes 2 2 2 zero valent iron process the zero valent iron process zvi was carried out in a glass reactor of total volume 0 5 dm3 to which mechanical stirring was applied 120 rpm in the zvi process waste cast iron chips fe with granulation 2 4 mm were used cast iron chips fe were soaked for 2 h in ethanol to remove rust and grease from the surface the effectiveness of the zvi process was investigated after pc for the following fe doses 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 80 and 100 g l and ph 3 after 60 min of the process ph of the samples was elevated to 9 0 with 3 m naoh solution and left for the sedimentation of the sludge the effectiveness of the zvi process was assessed based on the cod value of the supernatant 2 2 3 internal microelectrolysis internal microelectrolysis ime process was carried out in a glass reactor of total volume 0 5 dm3 to which mechanical stirring was applied 120 rpm in the ime process the following microelectrodes were used waste cast iron chips fe the same as in zvi granular activated carbon from nut shells gac with granulation 0 4 0 85 mm active surface 1100 m2 g the effectiveness of the ime process was examined at ph 3 the dosage of cast iron chips fe was 20 g dm3 and fe gac ratios were respectively 20 10 20 20 20 40 20 60 20 80 20 100 and 20 120 g g in 1 dm3 time of the experiment 60 min after 60 min the ime process was stopped by an increase of ph value to 9 0 using 3 m naoh solution and left for total sedimentation of the sludge the effectiveness of the ime process was assessed based on the cod value of the supernatant for the process conducted under optimal conditions the effectiveness of the process was additionally assessed based on toc and uv254 absorbance changes 2 2 4 ime o3 oh h2o2 the solution for ozonation after the ime process was separated from the sediment and transferred to the self constructed plexiglass 1 l cylindrical reactor with a diameter of 8 cm and the sander ozone generator ozone was introduced through a porous fritted diffuser and flow was set constant at 40 l h ozone was applied in doses from 0 28 to 1 4 g dm3 hydrogen peroxide was added at the beginning of the process in the mass ratios of cod h2o2 as follows 1 0 1 0 5 1 1 1 1 5 and 1 2 samples 2 cm3 were taken every hour without opening the reactor for cod determination the unreacted ozone leaving the reactor was collected in glass scrubbers with a potassium iodide solution and recovered after the experiment before the determination of cod hydrogen peroxide was removed from the sample using catalase from the bovine liver sigma aldrich poland for the process conducted under optimal conditions the effectiveness of the process was additionally assessed based on toc and uv254 absorbance changes 2 3 analytical methods total nitrogen ammonia nitrogen chlorides ph electrolytic conductivity and cod were determined according to the european standard methods uv254 absorbance was determined with the use of hach dr 5000 spectrophotometer bod5 was measured by an oxitop set wtw total organic carbon toc was determined according to the en 1484 1999 standard with a toc l analyzer shimadzu kyoto japan with an oct l8 port sampler shimadzu kyoto japan the combustion temperature was set to 680 c 2 4 formulas and calculations applied in the article 2 4 1 specific ultraviolet absorbance suva suva is calculated by dividing a sample s uv 254 value in cm 1 by the toc in mg c l this calculation allows the amount of aromatic compounds absorbance at 254 nm to be normalized over the overall organic load in wastewater 2 4 2 ozone consumption the quantity of ozone consumed for a given mass of cod removed is defined as 27 7 oc qgv 0 tcag 0 cagdtcod0 cod where q g is the gas flow rate v is the reactor volume c ag is the off gas ozone concentration c ag0 is the input ozone concentration t is the time and cod0 and cod are the initial and final cod 3 results 3 1 raw landfill leachate characteristic characteristics of raw ll are shown in table 2 ll had dark brown color fig 5a characteristic odor and high salinity cod 1224 mg o2 dm3 toc and uv254 absorbance were as follows 578 mg c dm3 and 12 8 cm 1 respectively attention deserves low ratio bod5 cod equal 0 13 demonstrating low biodegradability of this leachate 3 2 effectiveness of preliminary coagulation for different ph in the case of all ph values 2 3 4 and 5 precipitation of the humic substances hs was observed for ph 2 and 3 hs precipitated immediately and settled slowly the volumes of sediments were as follows 58 and 54 cm3 for ph 2 0 and 3 0 respectively it was observed that during sedimentation the sediment particles enlarged at ph 4 the precipitate formed more slowly volume of sediment 30 cm3 and at ph 5 very little precipitate was observed the cod removal after pc was 22 4 19 8 14 6 and 1 7 for ph 2 3 4 and 5 respectively for ph 3 additionally toc and uv254 absorbance were measured and values of those parameters were as follows 359 mg c dm3 and 8 62 cm 1 respectively figs 1 2 3 3 effectiveness of zvi results of the effectiveness of cod removal in the zvi process for different fe doses ranging from 5 to 50 g dm3 at ph three are presented in fig 3 the application of zvi with different doses after pc resulted in further cod removal by 0 7 46 9 total cod removal 20 5 66 7 an optimal fe dose of 20 g dm3 has been chosen and further experiments were carried out only with this dose for this dose the total cod removal was 39 0 the volume of sediment of iron hydroxide was 230 cm3 and the supernatant was characterized with no turbidity and yellow color further increase in cast iron dose did not give any significant changes in cod removal but resulted in higher turbidity of supernatant and higher volume of sediment of fe oh 3 however in the classic zvi process h2o2 is applied in different doses together with fe in the presented study h2o2 was not used results obtained from studies on the effectiveness of the zvi process conducted in that non standard way constituted the reference data for the ime process in which h2o2 has also not been used 3 4 effectiveness of ime process total cod removals obtained for ph 3 and fe gac ratios from 20 10 to 20 120 g g in 1 dm 3 were from 38 0 to 83 0 respectively single pc gave 19 8 of cod removal fig 4 toc and uv254 absorbance were 51 mg c dm3 and 0 68 cm 1 respectively figs 1 2 and the color was brown fig 5c to assess the effectiveness of single sorption on gac experiments with the same doses of gac similar to the ime process were performed for ll after pc in ph 3 for gac doses from 10 to 120 g dm3 without fe cod removal was obtained in a range of 11 2 62 6 total cod removal of 31 0 82 4 fig 4 although detailed studies on the sorption process have not been the main goal of the presented study it was possible to prepare the adsorption isotherms of cod on gac based on the studies from the experiment figs 1s and 2s 3 5 effectiveness of o3 oh and o3 oh h2o2 processes results from the cod removal of o3 oh and o3 oh h2o2 processes are presented in table 3 for both processes the effectiveness rose together with the time of the process but the increase was very small 1 6 4 6 the highest cod removal was observed for o3 oh h2o2 molar ratio o3 h2o2 1 1 after 4 h 95 8 to the value 51 mg o2 l the addition of h2o2 o3 h2o2 oh improved the effectiveness of the process by 0 1 4 2 compared to the process without h2o2 an improvement was observed for a longer time of the process on the other hand for higher doses of h2o2 the effectiveness of the process decreased 0 3 3 8 and the drop was less significant for longer times of the process during the process a slight decrease in ph value was also observed at the end of the process after 4 h it was between 7 5 and 7 7 the values of toc and absorbance uv254 were reduced to 34 mg c dm3 and 0 23 cm 1 respectively figs 1 2 there was also observed the change of the color of the solution initially brown orange color during the ozonation turned into pink orange after 1 h and at the end it became almost colorless fig 5d the biodegradability cod bod5 was improved after the o3 oh h2o2 process up to 0 36 4 discussion 4 1 raw landfill leachate characteristic the composition of ll is typical for mature municipal landfills and similar to other ll collected from different landfills in poland 16 17 26 worth mentioning is the high content of chlorides 2 5 g l in the case of processes based on hydroxyl radicals aops and partially ime processes the presence of chlorides could negatively affect the effectiveness of the process halides together with carbonates are known as scavengers of hydroxyl radicals 27 29 chlorides reacting with the oh creating radical reactive halogen species rhs which are strong but selective oxidants however rhs are essential oxidants in the case of wastewaters with high salinity the formation of halogenated byproducts is reported as minimal 30 high absorbance at 254 nm 12 1 cm 1 indicates a high content of humic substances in ll organic compounds specifically those containing aromatic rings or unsaturated carbon bonds double or triple in their molecular structure absorb the uv light as it passes through the wastewater sample on the other hand the low suva parameter value of 0 022 m2 g c proves a high degree of stabilization of the landfill the suva parameter allows assessing the number of aromatic compounds present in tested wastewater and its low values indicate a small contribution of aromatic rings in the molecules of these compounds in mature ll among organic compounds macromolecular and hardly biodegradable compounds could be found 4 2 pretreatment effectiveness presented studies showed that the effectiveness of pc strongly depends on ph value the volume of precipitated hs and cod removal was increasing while ph value was decreasing these results are in accordance with results published by other authors 16 31 32 as a result of acidification the dissociation of hs is drawn back stabilizing effect of negative electric charge of macromolecules disappears which decreases their solubility as a result they precipitate from the leachate the highest cod removal by pc was 22 4 the fact that it requires no additional reagents acidification is the first step in the ime process makes the pc highly reasonable as a pretreatment process before ime at the same time the toc value was reduced by 37 9 the only disadvantage of this process could be the long sedimentation time required to settle down of hs 4 h however ph 2 gave a slightly better effect acidification of leachate to ph 2 requires much more sulfuric acid than ph 3 thus ph 3 was established as optimal and chosen for all further experiments similar results were obtained by zhang et al 9 those authors did not include ph 2 in their research but their results for ph 3 were much better than for ph 1 21 higher cod removal the explanation for that phenomenon could be the fact that below ph 2 the scavenging effect of hydroxyl radicals by hydrogen ions occurs according to the following reaction eq 8 33 8 oh h e h 2 o additionally in low ph complexes with water molecules are formed e g fe h2o fe h2o 6 3 on the other hand electrooxidation processes on the cast iron cathode reaction 1 are more effective in low ph so the whole electrochemical ime process is more effective in lower ph reactions on the cathode and anode must be balanced moreover the fenton reaction which is somehow present as sequent in the ime process is the most effective in the ph range between 2 0 and 4 5 also at higher ph values iron hydroxides precipitate due to lower solubility flocks are settled down on the surface of microelectrodes therefore the electron transfer between iron and solution would be partially blocked additionally hs at low ph is mostly in non dissociated forms which more readily undergo sorption on gac 15 which would enhance the ime process effectiveness all this prejudged the choice of the ph 3 for further ime process the effect of pc on the effectiveness of the treatment process applied to landfill leachates was also investigated by krzysztoszek and naumczyk 16 the authors investigated the efficiency of the fenton process conducted classically and after acidification to different ph values and separation of hs pc modified fenton process for optimal parameters of the process the difference in cod removal between classic and modified fenton processes was 1 3 which constitutes only 2 of the total removal of cod in the modified fenton process krzysztoszek and naumczyk 16 explained that fact as follows in both cases classic and modified fenton final coagulation occurs and it plays a significant role in hs removal higher than pc therefore in the case of the ime process application of pc seems to be very reasonable due to its high contribution in total cod removal and simplicity of application no additional reagents or equipment are needed what is more in pc process hs are removed significantly the uv254 absorbance decreased by 32 6 which reduces the disadvantageous phenomenon of blocking the electrode surface by the flocks 4 3 effectiveness of zvi process in the case of zvi the highest cod removal 66 7 was obtained for a dose of fe 50 g dm3 although the cod removal rose together with the amount of fe the improvement for doses higher than 20 g l was not much significant 11 1 27 7 for doses 30 50 g of fe respectively when considering the amount of fe which must be additionally used what is more the visual quality turbidity color of the solution after sedimentation of the sludge was the best for the dose of fe 20 g l to the authors best knowledge there are only three papers that deal with applying the zvi process to ll still the process was conducted differently with the use of h2o2 and effectiveness was assessed based on toc removal 32 or the process was applied to the ll after biological treatment 33 34 martins et al 34 obtained cod removal of 38 for ll after biological treatment ph 2 for optimal conditions of the zvi process on the other hand bogacki et al 32 obtained 53 of toc removal for optimal conditions of the zvi process 4 4 effectiveness of ime process studies on the ime process showed the general rule that the effectiveness of the process was higher for higher doses of fe and gac but the increase was not directly proportional to the doses of microelectrodes and for higher doses it was very low fig 4 however the highest total cod removal was obtained for fe gac ratio 20 120 g g l 1 83 0 the most efficient seems to be the ratio of 20 80 g g l 1 total cod removal 76 7 fig 4 the difference in the cod removal between doses 20 80 20 100 and 20 120 g g l 1 3 was 2 6 3 which is insignificant when considering the amount of additional gac required other authors investigated ime processes efficiency with the addition of h2o2 which causes the fenton reaction to dominate over microelectrolysis processes researchers who studied the ime process with h2o2 for optimal conditions obtained cod removal in the range of 60 7 to 90 3 9 14 although in the presented study h2o2 was not added on the ime stage cod removal was comparable or even higher than cited authors up to 83 0 after pc for ph 3 and fe gac ratio 20 120 g g l 1 results of this study show that sorption on gac is a dominant process in the ime process the share of sorption in the ime process for total cod removal was in the range 11 2 62 6 fig 4 on the other hand the share of the ime oxidation reaction in cod removal rose for lower ratios fe gac it seems to be an important observation since most authors ignored the fact of the sorption of compounds present in ll on gac 9 11 13 14 others tried to eliminate this process by soaking gac in raw ll before the ime process 12 35 36 in our opinion both mentioned ideas seem to be wrong soaking gac in raw leachate before the ime process does not guarantee total elimination of the sorption phenomenon it leads only to establish some dynamic balance between solution and gac but it does not mean that the total sorption capacity of gac is reached when such gac is later used for new landfill leachates with different cod values there are two possible scenarios which lead to constitute a new balance further sorption on the gac or desorption from the gac surface of some compounds to the solution therefore in our opinion sorption in the ime process should be treated as an integrated part of the ime process although in the literature the issue of sorption of organics from ll has been investigated in terms of kinetic and adsorption isotherm 37 39 it is difficult to conclude about its exact impact on the ime process efficiency however in the presented study the share of sorption on gac in the ime process has been investigated and the whole experiment had been planned in that context the adsorption isotherms have been prepared and presented in supplementary data figs 1s and 2s in our opinion the issue seems to be interesting and should be further studied in more detail 4 5 effectiveness of o3 oh and o3 oh h2o2 processes results obtained for o3 oh and o3 oh h2o2 processes show that both processes are effective for ll treatment after the ime process for optimal parameters of the o3 oh h2o2 process the cod was decreased by an additional 18 7 from 76 7 to 95 4 for both processes the effectiveness rose together with the time of the process but the increase was very small 1 3 4 6 the highest effectiveness was observed for o3 oh h2o2 after 4 h 95 8 to the value of 51 mg o2 l but the improvement in comparison with the result obtained after 3 h was insignificant 0 4 thus 3 h was selected as the optimal cod reduced to the value of 56 mg o2 l the correlation between the time and the cod removal could be explained by the mechanism of the oxidation process in both processes the production of hydroxyl radicals depends on the amount of o3 dissolved in the solution and oh ions reactions 9 15 occur in o3 oh process and reactions 16 19 in the o3 oh h2o2 process respectively 17 40 9 ho o 3 o 2 ho 2 10 ho 2 h o 2 11 o 2 o 3 o 2 o 3 12 o 3 h ho 3 13 ho 3 ho o 2 14 ho o 3 ho 2 o 2 15 3o 3 oh h 2ho 4o 2 16 h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 17 ho 2 o 3 ho 2 o 3 18 h 2 o 2 o 3 h 2 o 2o 2 19 2o 3 h 2 o 2 2oh 3o 2 what is more for optimal parameters of the combined process high toc removal was obtained 94 1 to the value of 34 mg c l and uv254 absorbance decreased by 98 2 that together with the fact that solution became colorless indicate almost total organic removal the biodegradability bod5 cod of the effluent also rose to 0 36 the change of the ph value observed during the process was probably due to the formation of carboxylic acids and their directives it also correlates with the color changes observed during the process pink orange color could be from ketones and aldehydes which are known as intermediate products of the oxidation the drop in ph value is probably responsible for the lower reaction rate observed after the longer time of the process the reactions in which hydroxyl radicals are formed eqs 9 19 take place as long as the ph of the solution is alkaline when the ph value is close to 7 or below it starts to dominate direct oxidation with molecular ozone a weaker oxidizing agent 41 a similar phenomenon was observed for the o3 h2o2 additionally the drop of ph causes the stabilization of the molecule of h2o2 42 which results in fewer hydroxyl radicals production improvement in the cod removal of the process after the addition of h2o2 o3 h2o2 oh process was observed 1 4 to 4 2 in comparison to the process conducted without h2o2 o3 oh and the lower improvement in the cod removal for higher doses of h2o2 max by 3 8 that phenomenon could be explained by the reaction of oh with h2o2 leading to the decay of oh 43 a similar situation was observed in our previous work when both processes were applied for the treatment of chlorophenols 44 in the literature ozone based processes were applied mostly to raw ll 17 45 46 wable et al 45 used o3 h2o2 process to ll and observed 95 of cod removal o3 dose at 7 g o3 l and h2o2 o3 mass ratio 0 4 g g gomez et al 46 achieved 57 cod removal after the o3 h2o2 process and the use of an expensive method of o3 h2o2 uv allowed for an additional reduction of cod only to 67 the ozonation process after pc which naumczyk 17 used in his research allowed 90 removal of cod after 360 min for optimal parameters h2o2 fe ii was estimated to be 3500 150 mg l 2000 mg l o3 dose of 750 mg h 4 6 cost evaluation and the possibility of the application although aops have been known for decades the researchers mainly focused on laboratory tests or rarely on pilot studies in industry aops dominate installations based on conventional technologies such as coagulation flocculation or biological treatment to the author s best knowledge during the last 15 years there have been only a few aops based on the fenton process installations at the full technical scale commissioned in poland typical analyzed costs are related to electricity and reagent consumption 47 an essential parameter in ozone based processes is the consumption of ozone oc which could correlate with operating costs in the present study the value of oc calculated based on eq 7 for optimal parameters of the o3 h2o2 oh process is equal to 3 5 kg o3 kg of cod removed the literature cited ozone consumption values from less than 1 kg o3 kg cod to 16 kg o3 kg cod typical values are between 2 and 3 for ozone systems alone the variations in ozone consumption shown in literature are due mainly to the wide variations of the characteristics of the leachate studied e g leachate age ph organic composition oh scavengers etc 48 typically for intermediate cod removal about 50 when ozone based aops are used ozone consumption was about 1 5 kg o3 kg cod 47 48 still it increased up to 3 5 kg o3 kg cod when the cod removal was high about 95 49 although it is possible to calculate the costs of the treatment on a laboratory scale it is difficult to assess the total costs of implementing the process in the industry depending on the country there are different investment costs additionally prices are also different for different treatment plant sizes reagents energy demand etc it is also well known that transferring the technology from the laboratory to the industrial scale requires some additional research to adjust the parameters of the process to the new conditions in most cases the efficiency of the process decreases in treatment plants where the coagulation flocculation process is used the reactors could also be used for the ime process but a new installation for ozonation should be built sometimes landfills have a system for aeration leachate in that situation the adjustment to the ozonation treatment could be considered the cost of reagents depends on the process however chemicals used for ph corrections and perhydrol are relatively cheap and readily available on the other hand iron chips used in the ime process can be obtained from the waste materials of metal machining plants like in the presented study also gac could be obtained from some waste materials e g nutshells additionally the iron chips could be separated after the process to reuse e g electromagnetically there are no studies on the possibility of reusing gac after the ime process to our best knowledge it is quite probable that the ime process could be continued with the same gac but additional studies should be conducted to assess the process s effectiveness in such a way although aops are still considered more expensive than conventional treatment of wastewater in some cases their application is necessary then the possibility of using a process requiring minimal reagent consumption and based on the use of waste materials seems to be worth considering due to the possibility of relatively lower costs than processes requiring the purchase of chemical reagents it should be noted that an individual analysis of the costs of such an investment is necessary 5 conclusions the application of the pc in the ime process seems to be very reasonable results presented in this study showed a high contribution 19 8 for ph 3 in total cod removal total cod removal pc ime from 38 0 to 83 0 additionally acidification is the first step of the ime process so pc requires no additional reagents or equipment the effectiveness of pc depended strongly on ph value and maximum cod removal was observed for ph 2 22 4 the only disadvantage of this process could be the sedimentation time needed to settle down hs results showed that for all investigated ratios of fe gac separation of the hs positively affected the cod removal pc allows avoiding undesirable phenomena of covering microelectrodes with flocks of hs in pc compounds with high molecular weight are removed which hardly undergo oxidation but act as scavengers of hydroxyl radicals studies on the ime process showed that it is possible to achieve good efficiency up to 83 0 of the process conducted without h2o2 results obtained in the presented studies were even higher than results obtained by those authors who used h2o2 the results showed that the effectiveness of the ime process depended on doses of fe and gac for higher doses of fe and gac higher efficacy of the ime process was observed results of the presented study state that sorption on gac has a great share in the ime process 11 2 62 6 especially in the case of higher doses of gac the share of the ime oxidation reaction decreased for higher ratios of fe gac doses applying a three step process of ime o3 oh h2o2 to the mature landfill leachate seemed reasonable due to its high efficiency cod and toc removal by 95 4 and 94 1 respectively for optimal process parameters also high color removal the solution became colorless reduction of the uv254 absorbance by 98 2 and improvement of biodegradability bod5 cod ratio up to 0 36 these results show that the process ensures the effluent suitable for further biological treatment in municipal plants additionally the

13181,traditional wastewater treatment methods are often insufficient in the case of mature landfill leachate therefore novel methods are in demand recently internal microelectrolysis ime has been recognized as an effective method besides aops for refractory wastewaters treatment this study investigated the efficiency of a novel combined three step process ime o3 oh h2o2 applied to mature landfill leachate treatment waste iron chips and granulated activated carbon gac from nut shells were used in the process ozone was applied in doses from 0 28 to 1 4 g dm3 and the mass ratios of cod h2o2 were as follows 1 0 1 0 5 1 1 1 1 5 and 1 2 results showed that the pc is a reasonable pretreatment process before ime however cod and toc removal was up to 22 4 and 37 9 respectively it required no additional reagents before ime acidification is needed the best total cod removal in the ime process was for fe gac ratio 20 80 g g in 1 dm3 76 7 studies on the sorption process on gac showed a significant share in the ime process 11 2 62 6 of total cod removal that was an important observation since most other authors ignored the fact of sorption for optimal parameters of the o3 oh h2o2 total cod removal was 95 4 the values of toc absorbance uv254 and color were highly reduced by 91 2 94 7 and 98 2 respectively additionally biodegradability has been significantly improved up to 0 36 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aops internal micro electrolysis ime landfill leachate oxidation processes ozonation 1 introduction the chemical characteristic of landfill leachate ll depends strongly on the age of the landfill it is observed that in the case of young or not stabilized leachate 2 years organic compounds with relatively low molecular mass dominate such leachate is characterized by high total organic carbon toc chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and bod5 cod ratio above 0 4 1 on the contrary the old or stabilized leachate contains a high molecular mass of organics humic substances hs it has lower toc cod bod5 values and bod5 cod ratio contains compounds that are hazardous and resistant to biological treatment the more detailed characteristics of ll at different ages are presented in supplementary data table 1s that is why there is a need to apply powerful chemical methods to ll purification in most publications authors denote processes that could be used in the industry such as coagulation flocculation adsorption membrane methods and biological treatment in the case of leachate from mature municipal landfills those methods are insufficient because they do not remove all hazardous substances examples of compounds harmful to humans and the environment that remain in leachate after being treated by those methods are mainly petroleum hydrocarbons phthalates esters siloxanes and phenols 2 in recent years internal microelectrolysis ime has been extensively investigated for different industrial wastewaters treatment 3 6 when a mixture of iron anode and carbon cathode particles are mixed and in contact with each other in an acidic electrolyte many microscopic galvanic cells are formed the process occurs due to the difference in redox potential between fe and c microelectrodes 0 44 v it could be described by the following reactions eqs 1 and 2 1 7 8 iron anode oxidation 1 fe fe 2 2e carbon cathode reduction 2 2h aq 2e 2 h h 2 g when the process is conducted with active aeration the mechanism is different in this case the oxygen atom acts as an electron acceptor and competes with hydrogen as a result h2o2 is generated in situ according to the reactions below eqs 3 5 3 o 2 g 4h aq 4e 2h 2 o 4 o 2 g 4h aq 2e 2h 2 o 2 5 o 2 g 2h 2 o 4e aq 4oh aq subsequently h2o2 reacts with ferrous ions released from iron scraps which initiates the fenton s reaction eq 6 6 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh there are few publications about the treatment of landfill leachate by the ime process 9 14 and three of them deal with the best reactor parameters for conducting the process 10 11 13 for optimal process parameters 55 72 g dm3 fe c in a ratio of 3 1 and 12 32 g dm3 h2o2 ph 3 12 wang et al 13 obtained 74 59 reduction in cod and the ratio bod5 cod was 0 5 the other model of the reactor was proposed by ying et al 10 11 internal microelectrolysis ime was carried out in three ways without aeration with full aeration and as a combined process in one sime reactor experimental data showed that combined processes gave the best cod removal 73 7 1 3 which was higher than single processes by 15 2 and 24 8 with and without aeration respectively when the sequencing bath interior microelectrolysis reactor sime was in continuous mode the cod removal was higher and equaled 86 1 10 two publications concerned treatment ll membrane concentrate 12 14 for ll nanofiltration concentrate after coagulation with pac coupled with ime process huang et al 12 achieved removal efficiency for cod and toc 79 2 and 79 6 respectively for h2o2 0 75 mm and 2 h of retention time song et al 14 applied the ime process to treat reverse osmosis ro effluent and they achieved cod removal efficiency of 86 9 for gac fe 717 143 8 surface area ratio ph 3 8 and 1687 6 mg l h2o2 most cited authors used the rsm response surface methodology method to optimize operating variables there is only one paper in which the authors tried to optimize the ime process in laboratory experiments zhang et al 9 applied ime followed by the fenton process they achieved 60 0 cod removal efficiency after 90 min of ime and 105 min of the fenton process it is noteworthy that none of the cited authors mentioned the problem of precipitation of hs at low ph values which is supposed to be crucial in the case of mature landfill leachate in which hs is present in high quantities the solubility of hs depends strongly on ph 15 for the first time the separation of hs from acidified leachate was proposed by us as a modification of the fenton process preliminary coagulation pc 16 17 which significantly contributes to the final efficiency of the conventional fenton process industrial wastewater has usually been treated by integrating processes however in most cases physicochemical or biological methods have been combined with chemical processes and it seems reasonable to combine chemical processes based on different oxidation mechanisms among chemical methods which could be easily integrated with the ime process are advanced oxidation processes aops aops are a group of techniques based on hydroxyl radicals ho generation the hydroxyl radicals with the exception of fluorine are one of the most active oxidants known the most common aops processes are summarized in table 1 based on the available literature data of all aop methods used in the treatment of leachate 18 19 the most popular ones were fenton also fenton like and ozone based processes 16 20 21 the efficiency of the modified fenton process after acidification to ph 3 and sediment separation under optimum conditions has been proven to be very effective in cod removal 89 2 16 naumczyk et al 20 achieved similar results the efficiency of 120 min of m fenton process was higher than the efficiency obtained for either o3 h2o2 or h2o2 uv processes and reached 92 7 cod removal and bod5 cod ratio increased from 0 23 to 0 43 optimal dose of h2o2 fe ii was estimated to be 3500 150 mg l the most commonly used modification of the fenton process has been the additional application of uv radiation silva et al 21 successfully designed a photo fenton plant for the treatment of biologically oxidized landfill leachate he identified that cod could be decreased by photo fenton reaction by 57 80 80 225 mm h2o2 and 20 67 kj l accumulated uv energy on the other hand haapea et al 22 studied the treatment of industrial landfill leachates by chemical and biological methods such as ozonation ozonation with h2o2 h2o2 with biological post treatment for ozonated water cod and toc removal were 50 0 respectively by only using ozone 0 5 mg o3 mg cod at ph 10 after adding h2o2 to the leachate 3 2 mol h2o2 mol o3 cod and toc reduction were 37 20 respectively and the combination of ozone with biological treatment ph 9 5 0 3 mg o3 mg cod cod and toc were removed by 70 and 85 respectively wang et al 23 studied the oxidation of mature landfill leachate with o3 only and o3 h2o2 the maximum bod5 increase was about 110 for o3 h2o2 treatment and about 141 for o3 only treatment as the used ozone dose increased nh3 n and alkalinity decreased considerably and nitrite nitrate increased accordingly huang et al 24 used catalytic ozonation using activated carbon as a catalyst for advanced treatment of biologically treated landfill leachate the maximum cod removal reached 89 87 under the optimal conditions research on the ozonation after the fenton process for treating different landfill leachates was carried out by azis and abu amr 25 application of ozone treatment after the fenton process allowed for the cod color and ammonia nitrogen removal up to 87 100 and 22 respectively optimum doses of fe2 2800 mg l and h2o2 1700 mg l although the application of different aops methods alone or combined with physicochemical or biological methods for landfill leachate treatment has been widely discussed in the literature to the author s best knowledge there is no paper dealing with the combination of ime process with aops that s why in the presented study the authors focused on the concept of combining the ime process with the o3 oh h2o2 process additionally in the presented research the ime o3 oh h2o2 process was preceded with the pc which has never been applied before the ime process by other authors the main aims of the presented studies were the assessment of the treatment efficiency of the novel combined ime o3 oh h2o2 process for mature landfill leachate from a landfill site in poland the optimization of the preliminary coagulation pc applied before the ime o3 oh h2o2 process the optimization of the ime o3 oh h2o2 process on each step internal micro electrolysis ime and ozonation at ph 9 0 with different doses of h2o2 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection ll samples were collected from an old municipal landfill located near warsaw poland after collection samples were refrigerated at 4 c until analysis before each series of experiments ll was subjected to the initial 1 h sedimentation and the supernatant was separated by decantation all experiments with raw ll were conducted within 72 h of the sample collection most of the experiments were carried out in 3 4 repetitions 2 2 treatment processes 2 2 1 preliminary coagulation process preliminary coagulation process pc was conducted in 1 dm3 imhoff s funnels ph was adjusted to proper values of 2 3 4 and 5 with 10 m sulfuric vi acid the effectiveness of the pc process was assessed based on the cod value of supernatant and volume of sediment after 4 h sedimentation of precipitated hs for the process conducted under optimal conditions the effectiveness of the process was additionally assessed based on toc and uv254 absorbance changes 2 2 2 zero valent iron process the zero valent iron process zvi was carried out in a glass reactor of total volume 0 5 dm3 to which mechanical stirring was applied 120 rpm in the zvi process waste cast iron chips fe with granulation 2 4 mm were used cast iron chips fe were soaked for 2 h in ethanol to remove rust and grease from the surface the effectiveness of the zvi process was investigated after pc for the following fe doses 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 80 and 100 g l and ph 3 after 60 min of the process ph of the samples was elevated to 9 0 with 3 m naoh solution and left for the sedimentation of the sludge the effectiveness of the zvi process was assessed based on the cod value of the supernatant 2 2 3 internal microelectrolysis internal microelectrolysis ime process was carried out in a glass reactor of total volume 0 5 dm3 to which mechanical stirring was applied 120 rpm in the ime process the following microelectrodes were used waste cast iron chips fe the same as in zvi granular activated carbon from nut shells gac with granulation 0 4 0 85 mm active surface 1100 m2 g the effectiveness of the ime process was examined at ph 3 the dosage of cast iron chips fe was 20 g dm3 and fe gac ratios were respectively 20 10 20 20 20 40 20 60 20 80 20 100 and 20 120 g g in 1 dm3 time of the experiment 60 min after 60 min the ime process was stopped by an increase of ph value to 9 0 using 3 m naoh solution and left for total sedimentation of the sludge the effectiveness of the ime process was assessed based on the cod value of the supernatant for the process conducted under optimal conditions the effectiveness of the process was additionally assessed based on toc and uv254 absorbance changes 2 2 4 ime o3 oh h2o2 the solution for ozonation after the ime process was separated from the sediment and transferred to the self constructed plexiglass 1 l cylindrical reactor with a diameter of 8 cm and the sander ozone generator ozone was introduced through a porous fritted diffuser and flow was set constant at 40 l h ozone was applied in doses from 0 28 to 1 4 g dm3 hydrogen peroxide was added at the beginning of the process in the mass ratios of cod h2o2 as follows 1 0 1 0 5 1 1 1 1 5 and 1 2 samples 2 cm3 were taken every hour without opening the reactor for cod determination the unreacted ozone leaving the reactor was collected in glass scrubbers with a potassium iodide solution and recovered after the experiment before the determination of cod hydrogen peroxide was removed from the sample using catalase from the bovine liver sigma aldrich poland for the process conducted under optimal conditions the effectiveness of the process was additionally assessed based on toc and uv254 absorbance changes 2 3 analytical methods total nitrogen ammonia nitrogen chlorides ph electrolytic conductivity and cod were determined according to the european standard methods uv254 absorbance was determined with the use of hach dr 5000 spectrophotometer bod5 was measured by an oxitop set wtw total organic carbon toc was determined according to the en 1484 1999 standard with a toc l analyzer shimadzu kyoto japan with an oct l8 port sampler shimadzu kyoto japan the combustion temperature was set to 680 c 2 4 formulas and calculations applied in the article 2 4 1 specific ultraviolet absorbance suva suva is calculated by dividing a sample s uv 254 value in cm 1 by the toc in mg c l this calculation allows the amount of aromatic compounds absorbance at 254 nm to be normalized over the overall organic load in wastewater 2 4 2 ozone consumption the quantity of ozone consumed for a given mass of cod removed is defined as 27 7 oc qgv 0 tcag 0 cagdtcod0 cod where q g is the gas flow rate v is the reactor volume c ag is the off gas ozone concentration c ag0 is the input ozone concentration t is the time and cod0 and cod are the initial and final cod 3 results 3 1 raw landfill leachate characteristic characteristics of raw ll are shown in table 2 ll had dark brown color fig 5a characteristic odor and high salinity cod 1224 mg o2 dm3 toc and uv254 absorbance were as follows 578 mg c dm3 and 12 8 cm 1 respectively attention deserves low ratio bod5 cod equal 0 13 demonstrating low biodegradability of this leachate 3 2 effectiveness of preliminary coagulation for different ph in the case of all ph values 2 3 4 and 5 precipitation of the humic substances hs was observed for ph 2 and 3 hs precipitated immediately and settled slowly the volumes of sediments were as follows 58 and 54 cm3 for ph 2 0 and 3 0 respectively it was observed that during sedimentation the sediment particles enlarged at ph 4 the precipitate formed more slowly volume of sediment 30 cm3 and at ph 5 very little precipitate was observed the cod removal after pc was 22 4 19 8 14 6 and 1 7 for ph 2 3 4 and 5 respectively for ph 3 additionally toc and uv254 absorbance were measured and values of those parameters were as follows 359 mg c dm3 and 8 62 cm 1 respectively figs 1 2 3 3 effectiveness of zvi results of the effectiveness of cod removal in the zvi process for different fe doses ranging from 5 to 50 g dm3 at ph three are presented in fig 3 the application of zvi with different doses after pc resulted in further cod removal by 0 7 46 9 total cod removal 20 5 66 7 an optimal fe dose of 20 g dm3 has been chosen and further experiments were carried out only with this dose for this dose the total cod removal was 39 0 the volume of sediment of iron hydroxide was 230 cm3 and the supernatant was characterized with no turbidity and yellow color further increase in cast iron dose did not give any significant changes in cod removal but resulted in higher turbidity of supernatant and higher volume of sediment of fe oh 3 however in the classic zvi process h2o2 is applied in different doses together with fe in the presented study h2o2 was not used results obtained from studies on the effectiveness of the zvi process conducted in that non standard way constituted the reference data for the ime process in which h2o2 has also not been used 3 4 effectiveness of ime process total cod removals obtained for ph 3 and fe gac ratios from 20 10 to 20 120 g g in 1 dm 3 were from 38 0 to 83 0 respectively single pc gave 19 8 of cod removal fig 4 toc and uv254 absorbance were 51 mg c dm3 and 0 68 cm 1 respectively figs 1 2 and the color was brown fig 5c to assess the effectiveness of single sorption on gac experiments with the same doses of gac similar to the ime process were performed for ll after pc in ph 3 for gac doses from 10 to 120 g dm3 without fe cod removal was obtained in a range of 11 2 62 6 total cod removal of 31 0 82 4 fig 4 although detailed studies on the sorption process have not been the main goal of the presented study it was possible to prepare the adsorption isotherms of cod on gac based on the studies from the experiment figs 1s and 2s 3 5 effectiveness of o3 oh and o3 oh h2o2 processes results from the cod removal of o3 oh and o3 oh h2o2 processes are presented in table 3 for both processes the effectiveness rose together with the time of the process but the increase was very small 1 6 4 6 the highest cod removal was observed for o3 oh h2o2 molar ratio o3 h2o2 1 1 after 4 h 95 8 to the value 51 mg o2 l the addition of h2o2 o3 h2o2 oh improved the effectiveness of the process by 0 1 4 2 compared to the process without h2o2 an improvement was observed for a longer time of the process on the other hand for higher doses of h2o2 the effectiveness of the process decreased 0 3 3 8 and the drop was less significant for longer times of the process during the process a slight decrease in ph value was also observed at the end of the process after 4 h it was between 7 5 and 7 7 the values of toc and absorbance uv254 were reduced to 34 mg c dm3 and 0 23 cm 1 respectively figs 1 2 there was also observed the change of the color of the solution initially brown orange color during the ozonation turned into pink orange after 1 h and at the end it became almost colorless fig 5d the biodegradability cod bod5 was improved after the o3 oh h2o2 process up to 0 36 4 discussion 4 1 raw landfill leachate characteristic the composition of ll is typical for mature municipal landfills and similar to other ll collected from different landfills in poland 16 17 26 worth mentioning is the high content of chlorides 2 5 g l in the case of processes based on hydroxyl radicals aops and partially ime processes the presence of chlorides could negatively affect the effectiveness of the process halides together with carbonates are known as scavengers of hydroxyl radicals 27 29 chlorides reacting with the oh creating radical reactive halogen species rhs which are strong but selective oxidants however rhs are essential oxidants in the case of wastewaters with high salinity the formation of halogenated byproducts is reported as minimal 30 high absorbance at 254 nm 12 1 cm 1 indicates a high content of humic substances in ll organic compounds specifically those containing aromatic rings or unsaturated carbon bonds double or triple in their molecular structure absorb the uv light as it passes through the wastewater sample on the other hand the low suva parameter value of 0 022 m2 g c proves a high degree of stabilization of the landfill the suva parameter allows assessing the number of aromatic compounds present in tested wastewater and its low values indicate a small contribution of aromatic rings in the molecules of these compounds in mature ll among organic compounds macromolecular and hardly biodegradable compounds could be found 4 2 pretreatment effectiveness presented studies showed that the effectiveness of pc strongly depends on ph value the volume of precipitated hs and cod removal was increasing while ph value was decreasing these results are in accordance with results published by other authors 16 31 32 as a result of acidification the dissociation of hs is drawn back stabilizing effect of negative electric charge of macromolecules disappears which decreases their solubility as a result they precipitate from the leachate the highest cod removal by pc was 22 4 the fact that it requires no additional reagents acidification is the first step in the ime process makes the pc highly reasonable as a pretreatment process before ime at the same time the toc value was reduced by 37 9 the only disadvantage of this process could be the long sedimentation time required to settle down of hs 4 h however ph 2 gave a slightly better effect acidification of leachate to ph 2 requires much more sulfuric acid than ph 3 thus ph 3 was established as optimal and chosen for all further experiments similar results were obtained by zhang et al 9 those authors did not include ph 2 in their research but their results for ph 3 were much better than for ph 1 21 higher cod removal the explanation for that phenomenon could be the fact that below ph 2 the scavenging effect of hydroxyl radicals by hydrogen ions occurs according to the following reaction eq 8 33 8 oh h e h 2 o additionally in low ph complexes with water molecules are formed e g fe h2o fe h2o 6 3 on the other hand electrooxidation processes on the cast iron cathode reaction 1 are more effective in low ph so the whole electrochemical ime process is more effective in lower ph reactions on the cathode and anode must be balanced moreover the fenton reaction which is somehow present as sequent in the ime process is the most effective in the ph range between 2 0 and 4 5 also at higher ph values iron hydroxides precipitate due to lower solubility flocks are settled down on the surface of microelectrodes therefore the electron transfer between iron and solution would be partially blocked additionally hs at low ph is mostly in non dissociated forms which more readily undergo sorption on gac 15 which would enhance the ime process effectiveness all this prejudged the choice of the ph 3 for further ime process the effect of pc on the effectiveness of the treatment process applied to landfill leachates was also investigated by krzysztoszek and naumczyk 16 the authors investigated the efficiency of the fenton process conducted classically and after acidification to different ph values and separation of hs pc modified fenton process for optimal parameters of the process the difference in cod removal between classic and modified fenton processes was 1 3 which constitutes only 2 of the total removal of cod in the modified fenton process krzysztoszek and naumczyk 16 explained that fact as follows in both cases classic and modified fenton final coagulation occurs and it plays a significant role in hs removal higher than pc therefore in the case of the ime process application of pc seems to be very reasonable due to its high contribution in total cod removal and simplicity of application no additional reagents or equipment are needed what is more in pc process hs are removed significantly the uv254 absorbance decreased by 32 6 which reduces the disadvantageous phenomenon of blocking the electrode surface by the flocks 4 3 effectiveness of zvi process in the case of zvi the highest cod removal 66 7 was obtained for a dose of fe 50 g dm3 although the cod removal rose together with the amount of fe the improvement for doses higher than 20 g l was not much significant 11 1 27 7 for doses 30 50 g of fe respectively when considering the amount of fe which must be additionally used what is more the visual quality turbidity color of the solution after sedimentation of the sludge was the best for the dose of fe 20 g l to the authors best knowledge there are only three papers that deal with applying the zvi process to ll still the process was conducted differently with the use of h2o2 and effectiveness was assessed based on toc removal 32 or the process was applied to the ll after biological treatment 33 34 martins et al 34 obtained cod removal of 38 for ll after biological treatment ph 2 for optimal conditions of the zvi process on the other hand bogacki et al 32 obtained 53 of toc removal for optimal conditions of the zvi process 4 4 effectiveness of ime process studies on the ime process showed the general rule that the effectiveness of the process was higher for higher doses of fe and gac but the increase was not directly proportional to the doses of microelectrodes and for higher doses it was very low fig 4 however the highest total cod removal was obtained for fe gac ratio 20 120 g g l 1 83 0 the most efficient seems to be the ratio of 20 80 g g l 1 total cod removal 76 7 fig 4 the difference in the cod removal between doses 20 80 20 100 and 20 120 g g l 1 3 was 2 6 3 which is insignificant when considering the amount of additional gac required other authors investigated ime processes efficiency with the addition of h2o2 which causes the fenton reaction to dominate over microelectrolysis processes researchers who studied the ime process with h2o2 for optimal conditions obtained cod removal in the range of 60 7 to 90 3 9 14 although in the presented study h2o2 was not added on the ime stage cod removal was comparable or even higher than cited authors up to 83 0 after pc for ph 3 and fe gac ratio 20 120 g g l 1 results of this study show that sorption on gac is a dominant process in the ime process the share of sorption in the ime process for total cod removal was in the range 11 2 62 6 fig 4 on the other hand the share of the ime oxidation reaction in cod removal rose for lower ratios fe gac it seems to be an important observation since most authors ignored the fact of the sorption of compounds present in ll on gac 9 11 13 14 others tried to eliminate this process by soaking gac in raw ll before the ime process 12 35 36 in our opinion both mentioned ideas seem to be wrong soaking gac in raw leachate before the ime process does not guarantee total elimination of the sorption phenomenon it leads only to establish some dynamic balance between solution and gac but it does not mean that the total sorption capacity of gac is reached when such gac is later used for new landfill leachates with different cod values there are two possible scenarios which lead to constitute a new balance further sorption on the gac or desorption from the gac surface of some compounds to the solution therefore in our opinion sorption in the ime process should be treated as an integrated part of the ime process although in the literature the issue of sorption of organics from ll has been investigated in terms of kinetic and adsorption isotherm 37 39 it is difficult to conclude about its exact impact on the ime process efficiency however in the presented study the share of sorption on gac in the ime process has been investigated and the whole experiment had been planned in that context the adsorption isotherms have been prepared and presented in supplementary data figs 1s and 2s in our opinion the issue seems to be interesting and should be further studied in more detail 4 5 effectiveness of o3 oh and o3 oh h2o2 processes results obtained for o3 oh and o3 oh h2o2 processes show that both processes are effective for ll treatment after the ime process for optimal parameters of the o3 oh h2o2 process the cod was decreased by an additional 18 7 from 76 7 to 95 4 for both processes the effectiveness rose together with the time of the process but the increase was very small 1 3 4 6 the highest effectiveness was observed for o3 oh h2o2 after 4 h 95 8 to the value of 51 mg o2 l but the improvement in comparison with the result obtained after 3 h was insignificant 0 4 thus 3 h was selected as the optimal cod reduced to the value of 56 mg o2 l the correlation between the time and the cod removal could be explained by the mechanism of the oxidation process in both processes the production of hydroxyl radicals depends on the amount of o3 dissolved in the solution and oh ions reactions 9 15 occur in o3 oh process and reactions 16 19 in the o3 oh h2o2 process respectively 17 40 9 ho o 3 o 2 ho 2 10 ho 2 h o 2 11 o 2 o 3 o 2 o 3 12 o 3 h ho 3 13 ho 3 ho o 2 14 ho o 3 ho 2 o 2 15 3o 3 oh h 2ho 4o 2 16 h 2 o 2 ho 2 h 17 ho 2 o 3 ho 2 o 3 18 h 2 o 2 o 3 h 2 o 2o 2 19 2o 3 h 2 o 2 2oh 3o 2 what is more for optimal parameters of the combined process high toc removal was obtained 94 1 to the value of 34 mg c l and uv254 absorbance decreased by 98 2 that together with the fact that solution became colorless indicate almost total organic removal the biodegradability bod5 cod of the effluent also rose to 0 36 the change of the ph value observed during the process was probably due to the formation of carboxylic acids and their directives it also correlates with the color changes observed during the process pink orange color could be from ketones and aldehydes which are known as intermediate products of the oxidation the drop in ph value is probably responsible for the lower reaction rate observed after the longer time of the process the reactions in which hydroxyl radicals are formed eqs 9 19 take place as long as the ph of the solution is alkaline when the ph value is close to 7 or below it starts to dominate direct oxidation with molecular ozone a weaker oxidizing agent 41 a similar phenomenon was observed for the o3 h2o2 additionally the drop of ph causes the stabilization of the molecule of h2o2 42 which results in fewer hydroxyl radicals production improvement in the cod removal of the process after the addition of h2o2 o3 h2o2 oh process was observed 1 4 to 4 2 in comparison to the process conducted without h2o2 o3 oh and the lower improvement in the cod removal for higher doses of h2o2 max by 3 8 that phenomenon could be explained by the reaction of oh with h2o2 leading to the decay of oh 43 a similar situation was observed in our previous work when both processes were applied for the treatment of chlorophenols 44 in the literature ozone based processes were applied mostly to raw ll 17 45 46 wable et al 45 used o3 h2o2 process to ll and observed 95 of cod removal o3 dose at 7 g o3 l and h2o2 o3 mass ratio 0 4 g g gomez et al 46 achieved 57 cod removal after the o3 h2o2 process and the use of an expensive method of o3 h2o2 uv allowed for an additional reduction of cod only to 67 the ozonation process after pc which naumczyk 17 used in his research allowed 90 removal of cod after 360 min for optimal parameters h2o2 fe ii was estimated to be 3500 150 mg l 2000 mg l o3 dose of 750 mg h 4 6 cost evaluation and the possibility of the application although aops have been known for decades the researchers mainly focused on laboratory tests or rarely on pilot studies in industry aops dominate installations based on conventional technologies such as coagulation flocculation or biological treatment to the author s best knowledge during the last 15 years there have been only a few aops based on the fenton process installations at the full technical scale commissioned in poland typical analyzed costs are related to electricity and reagent consumption 47 an essential parameter in ozone based processes is the consumption of ozone oc which could correlate with operating costs in the present study the value of oc calculated based on eq 7 for optimal parameters of the o3 h2o2 oh process is equal to 3 5 kg o3 kg of cod removed the literature cited ozone consumption values from less than 1 kg o3 kg cod to 16 kg o3 kg cod typical values are between 2 and 3 for ozone systems alone the variations in ozone consumption shown in literature are due mainly to the wide variations of the characteristics of the leachate studied e g leachate age ph organic composition oh scavengers etc 48 typically for intermediate cod removal about 50 when ozone based aops are used ozone consumption was about 1 5 kg o3 kg cod 47 48 still it increased up to 3 5 kg o3 kg cod when the cod removal was high about 95 49 although it is possible to calculate the costs of the treatment on a laboratory scale it is difficult to assess the total costs of implementing the process in the industry depending on the country there are different investment costs additionally prices are also different for different treatment plant sizes reagents energy demand etc it is also well known that transferring the technology from the laboratory to the industrial scale requires some additional research to adjust the parameters of the process to the new conditions in most cases the efficiency of the process decreases in treatment plants where the coagulation flocculation process is used the reactors could also be used for the ime process but a new installation for ozonation should be built sometimes landfills have a system for aeration leachate in that situation the adjustment to the ozonation treatment could be considered the cost of reagents depends on the process however chemicals used for ph corrections and perhydrol are relatively cheap and readily available on the other hand iron chips used in the ime process can be obtained from the waste materials of metal machining plants like in the presented study also gac could be obtained from some waste materials e g nutshells additionally the iron chips could be separated after the process to reuse e g electromagnetically there are no studies on the possibility of reusing gac after the ime process to our best knowledge it is quite probable that the ime process could be continued with the same gac but additional studies should be conducted to assess the process s effectiveness in such a way although aops are still considered more expensive than conventional treatment of wastewater in some cases their application is necessary then the possibility of using a process requiring minimal reagent consumption and based on the use of waste materials seems to be worth considering due to the possibility of relatively lower costs than processes requiring the purchase of chemical reagents it should be noted that an individual analysis of the costs of such an investment is necessary 5 conclusions the application of the pc in the ime process seems to be very reasonable results presented in this study showed a high contribution 19 8 for ph 3 in total cod removal total cod removal pc ime from 38 0 to 83 0 additionally acidification is the first step of the ime process so pc requires no additional reagents or equipment the effectiveness of pc depended strongly on ph value and maximum cod removal was observed for ph 2 22 4 the only disadvantage of this process could be the sedimentation time needed to settle down hs results showed that for all investigated ratios of fe gac separation of the hs positively affected the cod removal pc allows avoiding undesirable phenomena of covering microelectrodes with flocks of hs in pc compounds with high molecular weight are removed which hardly undergo oxidation but act as scavengers of hydroxyl radicals studies on the ime process showed that it is possible to achieve good efficiency up to 83 0 of the process conducted without h2o2 results obtained in the presented studies were even higher than results obtained by those authors who used h2o2 the results showed that the effectiveness of the ime process depended on doses of fe and gac for higher doses of fe and gac higher efficacy of the ime process was observed results of the presented study state that sorption on gac has a great share in the ime process 11 2 62 6 especially in the case of higher doses of gac the share of the ime oxidation reaction decreased for higher ratios of fe gac doses applying a three step process of ime o3 oh h2o2 to the mature landfill leachate seemed reasonable due to its high efficiency cod and toc removal by 95 4 and 94 1 respectively for optimal process parameters also high color removal the solution became colorless reduction of the uv254 absorbance by 98 2 and improvement of biodegradability bod5 cod ratio up to 0 36 these results show that the process ensures the effluent suitable for further biological treatment in municipal plants additionally the solution meets legal discharge limits regarding the cod values declaration of competing interest this manuscript has not been published and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere we have

13182,the current study proposes a comprehensive fuzzy formulated multi criteria decision making mcdm framework with integrated life cycle assessment lca and life cycle cost assessment lcca approach for selection of best suitable wastewater treatment wwt system especially for multi storeyed residential buildings by utilising a thorough literature survey experts opinions and questionnaires the study attempts to identify four dimensions of sustainability with associated key nineteen indicators furthermore the study is benefited by undertaking quantitative parameters related to environmental and economic sustainability assessed by lca and lcca respectively the proposed three phase methodological framework illustrates the identification of widely used wwt systems in the first phase followed by fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp assessment for criteria and indicators screening and finalisation in the second phase and ranking of alternative by fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution ftopsis in the third phase moreover the current paper suggests a novel approach of incorporating environmental floor in multi storeyed building where gravity governed nature based wastewater treatment tanks of decentralized on site integrated waste management dosiwam system can be positioned to test the proposed framework the sustainability of dosiwam system is compared with five widely used wastewater treatment systems viz membrane bioreactor mbr moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr sequencing batch reactors sbr activated sludge process asp soil biotechnology sbt results of alternative ranking indicate dosiwam allocated at environmental floors as the best suitable option followed by the second third and fourth rank of mbr sbt and sbr respectively whereas mbbr and asp are the least preferred it has been observed that the experts prefer mostly natural treatment systems since they are more sustainable in environmental and economic considerations in addition by changing the weights of the main criteria sensitivity analysis is carried out considering five scenarios which signifies in three out of five scenarios relative percentage change in criteria weight does not affect the first rank of the dosiwam system the developed framework successfully facilitates a reliable base for the selection of the best suitable wwt system for multi storeyed residential building and could be made available to the relevant local planning authority to incentivize the effort undertaken for the welfare of citizens as well as the

residential building 1 introduction india as the world s largest freshwater consumer country is experiencing a severe water shortage it has been noticed from the comprehensive research conducted by the world bank that water shortage is a looming danger for the nation that has just 4 of the world s water resources irrespective of 17 of the world s population as per central pollution control board cpcb by 2030 india s water demand is forecast to increase up to 1 5 trillion cubic meters the major issues that have contributed to the depletion of water resources are the lack of adequate facilities and awareness about treating wastewater moreover improperly financed and under designed infrastructure facilities for wastewater treatment result in the direct dumping of household wastewater into rivers or lakes furthermore inadequately treated wastewater containing chromium which is the most hazardous and highly toxic contaminant even at low concentration can cause harmful impacts on the environment and several advanced treatment processes are essential for its removal 1 also it is very important to ensure harmful toxic metals from effluent does not affect marine life 2 the traditional centralized wastewater treatment wwt method pertains to the collection and transportation of wastewater to a treatment facility has much detrimental impact on nature as well as human health in this context decentralization with emerging innovative treatment solutions would help in achieving significant strategic advantages it would not only drives opportunities to lower down the burden on centralized systems but help in establishing more scalable and portable wwt options one such example is dosiwam decentralized on site integrated waste management system 3 2 research motive the current wastewater management practices specifically meant for residential townships need a paradigm shift despite the fact that the government has mandated treatment for residential societies with a built up area of more than 2000 square meters 30 of the existing conventional sewage treatment plants were found to be non functional 4 as stated by kalbar et al 5 hi tech mechanised treatment systems can be appropriate for the urban context but as far as multi storeyed housing societies are concerned these systems are usually chosen by the developer on the basis of past experience available cost and resources constraints which inherently has numerous problems and challenges such as a all these systems are energy driven with intermittent supply and lack of alternate source increase the risk of system failure b residents are burdened by the economic aspects of skilled workers deployment for scientific handling and yearly pay consent for operation and maintenance o m to municipal corporations c ground floor residents are subjected to unbearable noise and vibration if a treatment system is improperly allocated in the premises 6 this has collectively triggered the need for a treatment system which is socially acceptable economically viable environmentally sustainable and technologically simplified with this regards the eminent challenge is the selection of treatment system from the finite available options in order to take the first step towards sustainability achievement it is of utmost importance to carry out the selection process of an appropriate wwt system with a carefully designed methodological framework multi criteria decision making mcdm approaches are one of the most popular and widely used techniques in recent years 7 mcdm is a statistical system that allows users to select a decisive solution in a considerably reduced timeline for a specific problem such as wwt system selection and simplifies the selection process when multiple conflicting criteria exist furthermore as explored by many researchers decision making processes are availed with numerous methods where decision makers are bound to select the alternative with substantial benefits the most commonly implemented approach for solving a complex unstructured problem is analytical hierarchy process ahp 8 and it has been well integrated with other techniques such as ahp multidimensional scaling mds 9 ahp grey relation analysis gra 10 11 while ahp has its own set of advantages it also has certain drawbacks to tackle this anp was proposed as an improved and sophisticated version of ahp by gencer and gürpinar 12 likewise numerous hybrid methods have been developed to overcome the drawbacks of one another such as hybrid life cycle assessment lca based fuzzy mcdm 13 sadr et al 14 employed hybrid multi criteria decision analysis mcda with multi objective optimization moo and developed a tool for optimization of indian wastewater treatment technologies balkema et al 15 implemented a method analogous to lca moreover to deal with the fuzziness of decision makers fuzzy set theory has been incorporated in the traditional mcdm technique 8 16 18 thus the efficacy of the treatment system can be well ascertained by the mcdm approach which not only aids in the selection of the best suitable treatment alternative but also minimises the selection complexity 19 in the current study an improved version of fuzzy mcdm i e integrated fuzzy ahp topsis is carried out using life cycle assessment lca and life cycle cost assessment lcca approach to use their advantages for the selection of appropriate wwt system for multi storeyed residential building consequently using lca and lcca related databases and the statistical user interface an excel based soft tool is developed to perform every calculation of the fuzzy ahp topsis simple and fast this study builds on the work previously presented by dewalkar shastri 6 where a novel concept of incorporation of the environmental floor in the multi storeyed building was suggested the term environmental floor is designated to the refuge floor where dosiwam system s stabilization tanks greywater treatment are positioned keeping standard refuge area vacant and human night soil based malaprabha digesters blackwater treatment are located underground the complete treatment process is gravity governed with generated wastewater being collected from above located floors i e above refuge floor followed by the treatment at environmental floor and redistribution of treated effluent to lower floors fig 1 the major advantages are minimal area requirement by these treatment tanks as the amount of grey wastewater produced by intermittent floors determines treatment capacity in addition land occupancy in the premises of the building for the treatment process could be fairly eliminated moreover the whole treatment process is non mechanised and works on gravity this ensures no requirement of electromechanical mechanisms which could cause additional complications on the floor in the final section to illustrate the applicability of the suggested approach in a real life environment dosiwam allocated at environmental floors is compared with other widely used wastewater treatment systems specifically used for multi storeyed housing societies 3 research methodology in the process of selection of appropriate wastewater treatment system for multi storeyed residential building the three phase methodology is employed as shown in fig 2 first widely used wwt technologies implemented for multi storeyed housing societies are identified in the second phase the research employs the fuzzy ahp method and is computed using lca and lcca approaches in this phase decision makers vagueness is taken into consideration and the decision making hierarchy is finalised followed by the determination of weights of criteria and indicators by pairwise comparison matrices and in the final third phase fuzzy topsis is applied to evaluate alternatives and the process of the final ranking with several options available for wwt including mechanised and non mechanised selection of the best suitable alternative is quite difficult and is affected by many vital qualitative and quantitative parameters in the current study the problem associated with the selection of the wwt system is hierarchized into four levels the ultimate goal of the decision is positioned at the top level in the second and third levels criteria and indicators are assigned respectively followed by the bottom level which includes alternatives to be selected fig 3 the key research tool used in the current study involves the design and development of questionnaires from environmental experts professionals local constraints are the most important factor that can affect the decision making process hence the current study is benefited by involving a number of local experts and collecting their opinion academic professionals consultants dealing with wwt solutions and other research environmental domain experts were finalised for computing mainly qualitative data in order to express the relative significance of the criteria and indicators in pairwise comparisons experts were asked to carry out the assessment according to the scale of relative importance table 1 the flexibility of the scale gives freedom to experts for expressing their opinion and these observations were then translated to fuzzy numbers 3 1 phase i establishment of main criteria and indicators as stated by nathan et al 20 criteria and indicators included in the assessment should be carefully chosen since too many indicators may weaken the purpose whereas too few indicators may be insufficient to communicate the message sustainability indicators play the most vital role in the selection of appropriate wwt technology and these can be identified through several literatures 15 21 22 the selection of treatment process includes the assessment of multiple factors that must need to be incorporated in order to achieve the goal in this study the literature review is utilized as a source of collecting secondary data for selecting criteria indicators and this process was found to be commonly practiced by many researchers subsequently local constraints are the most important factor that can affect the decision making process thus local experts opinions are also assigned for screening and finalisation of criteria and indicators the concept of sustainability for the selection of the wwt system is divided into four main dimensions i e main criteria viz environmental economical technological and socio cultural quantitative and qualitative data are estimated separately since qualitative data indicators could not be directly quantified e g those associated with social indicators thus are quantified by a nine point scale whereas quantitative data indicators are estimated directly moreover the quantitative information for some qualitative data such as noise and odour were not available from plant technology that could be recorded in decibels and odour unit per cubic meter respectively hence both are considered as qualitative only to attain optimum achievement quantitative criteria are evaluated by lca and lcca with inclusive of field data collected from treatment plants such as land occupation the requirement of workers and their wages effluent data electricity consumption by electromechanical equipment and the requirement of chemicals for disinfection environmental assessment using the lca approach is the first main quantitative criteria considered which has six sets of indicators viz global warming potential gwp eutrophication potential ep ozone depletion potential odp photochemical oxidation potential pcop removal efficiency and energy consumption the generic eq 1 shown below is used for lca calculation 23 24 where lca indicators are based on characterisation factors provided in cml ia version 4 1 for the indian construction database removal efficiency is evaluated using eq 2 25 quantitative parameters like removal efficiency and energy consumption are collected from field scale wwt systems 1 indicator i characteriazation factor i m i 2 eg a 1 3 e tss e bod 3 e cod the second main quantitative criteria represent the economic aspect which is performed by lcca using the net present worth npw method eq 3 as per indian standards is 13174 part ii 26 where future cash flow is modified pertaining to the base date and discounting factor is calculated with consideration of inflation and interest rate eq 4 in the current methodological framework the base date is considered as jan 2019 economic criteria is analysed by four sub criteria indicators npw land occupation measured in terms of m2 kld the requirement of manpower and revenue generation i e recovery of resources that reflects the ability of wwt technology intended for discharge of effluent with desirable standards and energy recovery revenue generation in the form of human night soil based biogas energy can help in the replacement and or reduction of burden on conventional energy lcca incorporates capital expenditure capex which includes the cost of construction materials civil work required initial electromechanical setup and wages of workers operational expenditure opex includes the cost of electricity and chemical consumption throughout the life span of the treatment system repair and replacement of electromechanical equipment 3 npw capex opex upwf upwf 1 d n 1 d 1 d n 4 discount rate 1 interset rate 1 inflation rate 1 the next main qualitative criteria is technical which has the following indicators i reliability it is analysed as the treatment system s ability to attain adequate performance during a specific period in specific circumstances 27 electromechanical reliability and performance of treatment plant are the major aspects that need to be taken into consideration 28 and are characterised by their working efficiency and probability of dysfunction during a specified life span ii durability when it comes to durability the lifespan of treatment technology plays a vital role here all the treatment technologies are compared with the same scale of 50 years of lifespan and the durability aspect is considered with an emphasis on minimal electromechanical spare parts replacement and maintenance iii flexibility the treatment process should be able to withstand the variety of flow rates as well as increased organic loading thus the treatment system should be flexible enough if up gradation is required and adequately robust with minimal cost requirements flexibility also reflects land accommodation i e adequate space for treatment system for further future expansion if needed and treatment efficiency in routine and emergency operational conditions 29 iv replicability the treatment system which is to be selected should be technologically simple and familiar so that it can be easily and efficiently replicated without relying on technical resources v system s complexity it represents a crucial aspect in the selection process more the complex system more will be the requirement of skilled workers professional operations and specialised equipment with their spare parts requirements for the o m phase indicators associated with the fourth main qualitative criteria i e socio cultural dimension are explained as follows i stakeholders acceptance participation of community people and associated stakeholders are most often ignored nevertheless they play a major role related to the selection and implementation of appropriate treatment technology and thus for treatment plant implementation and further progress civic engagement should be facilitated ii visual impact it refers to the disturbance caused due to infrastructure and electromechanical set up in the premises of the building iii odour generation it denotes the generation of unwanted odour consideration of climatic conditions is an essential aspect biological processes are mostly dependent on temperature variations since the warm atmosphere can speed up the intensity of odour thus local climate plays important role in the selection procedure iv noise impact it represents disturbance generated from electromechanical equipment during the o m phase of the wwt system 3 2 phase ii fuzzy ahp the ahp approach is primarily used in frameworks that include crisp decisions application the classical standalone ahp generates and handles a highly unbalanced decision scale the uncertainty involved with mapping one s decision to a number is not taken into consideration the ranking of the alternatives has no enough precision and the findings are heavily influenced by the individual judgment and preferences of decision makers dms 30 33 it is also observed that being a subjective evaluation of qualitative attributes often results in a vague decision thus due to these inherent uncertainties with regards to human preferences the concept of amalgamation of fuzzy sets developed by zadeh 34 with the use of triangular fuzzy numbers tfns for expressing the weights of criteria results in a more precise process of decision making hence the objectivity of the outcomes in the current methodological framework is strengthened by using the fahp method which is considered to be a powerful approach in mcdm the difference between fuzzy sets and crisp set is fuzzy membership functions is mathematically defined as μ a x allow any real number in 0 1 interval while crisp sets only allow either 0 or 1 the study considered the most often used tfns which is characterised by the real number l m u the lower maximal and upper limit of the membership function is represented by l m u respectively and is denoted as eq 5 whereas the condition of non fuzzy numbers is when l m u 5 μ a x x l m l l x m n x n m m x n 0 otherwise the operations between tfn a 1 l 1 m 1 u 1 and a 2 l 2 m 2 u 2 are represented by the following eqs 6 9 in addition eq 10 shows the mathematical operation for calculating the distance between two tfn 6 a 1 a 2 l 1 m 1 u 1 l 2 m 2 u 2 l 1 l 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 u 2 7 a 1 a 2 l 1 m 1 u 1 l 2 m 2 u 2 l 1 l 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 u 2 8 a 1 a 2 l 1 m 1 u 1 l 2 m 2 u 2 l 1 u 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 l 2 9 a 1 a 2 l 1 m 1 u 1 l 2 m 2 u 2 l 1 u 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 l 2 10 d a 1 a 2 1 3 l 1 l 2 2 m 1 m 2 2 u 1 u 2 2 3 2 1 fuzzy ahp process similar to ahp the first step is to structure the decision making problem with defined criteria which could affect the decision making amongst the alternatives pairwise comparisons are carried out for criteria and indicators as per inputs obtained on the scale of relative importance the comparison matrix is formulated as expressed in eq 11 using tfn by asking dm s judgments of pairwise comparisons for criteria and indicators 11 a 1 a 12 a 1 n a 21 1 a 2 n a n 1 a n 2 1 the next step is the calculation of the relative weights multiple approaches dealing with fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices were suggested however owing to the computational ease the extent analysis method is the most commonly used the extent analysis method proposed by chang 35 is thus implemented for the pairwise comparison and further criteria weights are determined following are the steps of extent analysis let the object set and goal set are x x 1 x 2 x 3 x n and u u 1 u 2 u 3 u n respectively thus the value of m extent analysis for each object is denoted by the sign m gi 1 m gi 2 m gi 3 m gi m i 1 2 3 n where m gi j j 1 2 3 m are tfn after carrying out pairwise comparison the fuzzy synthetic extent of i th object is calculated by the computation of tfn as shown by eq 12 12 si j 1 m m gi j i 1 n j 1 m m gi j 1 where fuzzy operation for tfn is executed as 13 j 1 m m gi j j 1 m l j j 1 m m j j 1 m u j and i 1 n j 1 m m gi j 1 i 1 n l i i 1 n m i i 1 n u i 1 1 i n ui 1 i n mi 1 i n li considering tfn m 1 l 1 m 1 u 1 and m 2 l 2 m 2 u 2 the degree of possibility m 2 m 1 is defined as 14 v m 2 m 1 sup min μ m 1 x μ m 2 y and equivalently expressed as 15 v m 2 m 1 hgt m 1 m 2 μ m 2 d 1 if m 2 m 1 0 if l 1 u 2 l 1 u 2 m 2 u 2 m 1 l 1 otherwise where d is the ordinate of the highest intersection point d between μ m 1 and μ m 2 as shown in fig 4 where the intersection between m 1 and m 2 can be observed for the comparison of m 1 and m 2 both the values of v m 1 m 2 and v m 2 m 1 are necessary the degree of possibility for a convex fuzzy number to be larger than k convex fuzzy numbers m i i 1 2 k can be defined as 16 v m m 1 m 2 m k v m m 1 and m m 2 and m m k min v m m i i 1 2 3 k assume that d a i min v s i s k for k 1 2 n k i then the weight vector is given by 17 w d a 1 d a 2 d a n t where a i i 1 2 3 n are the n elements by normalisation normalised weight vectors are 18 w d a 1 d a 2 d a n t where w is the non fuzzy number 3 3 phase iii fuzzy topsis after defining fuzzy weights of criteria and indicators by f ahp ranking of the appropriate wastewater treatment system is carried out by topsis method developed by hwang and yoon 36 in 1981 where chosen preferred wastewater treatment alternative should be the one that is nearest to the positive ideal solution and farthest to the negative ideal solution the use of fuzzy numbers to assign the relative significance of alternatives is one of the key advantages of using topsis under the fuzzy environment since it is often difficult to tackle the associated uncertainty subjectivity and vagueness with crisp value in real life applications here linguistic terms which are then set to fuzzy numbers are used to map fuzzy decision matrices table 2 step 1 assuming there are m alternative denoted as a a 1 a 2 a 3 a m and n criteria denoted as c c 1 c 2 c 3 c n then performance rating for each expert d k 1 2 3 k is denoted by r k x ijk i 1 2 m j 1 2 n k 1 2 k for alternative a i i 1 2 m to be evaluated against criteria c j j 1 2 n with the membership function μ r k x step 2 determination of aggregate fuzzy rating if r k a k b k c k k 1 2 k r represents fuzzy ratings of all experts in tfn then the aggregate fuzzy rating is specified by r a b c k 1 2 k where 19 a min k a k b 1 k k 1 k b k c max k c k if the fuzzy rating for k th expert is x ijk a ijk b ijk c ijk i 1 2 m j 1 2 n with corresponding criteria weights w ijk then the aggregated fuzzy ratings x ij of the alternatives with respect to each criterion are given by x ij a ij b ij c ij where 20 a ij min k a ijk b ij 1 k k 1 k b ijk c ij max k c ijk step 3 fuzzy decision matrix d for assessment of alternatives wwt systems evaluated against criteria using linguistic variables assigned by the experts is determined by 21 d a 1 a 2 a m x 11 c 1 x 12 c 2 x 1 n c n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x mn i 1 2 m j 1 2 n step 4 linear scale transformation is used for the normalisation process which can be carried out by following eq 22 and for the set of benefit and cost criteria eqs 23 and 24 are used respectively 22 r r ij m x n i 1 2 m j 1 2 n 23 r ij a ij c j b ij c j c ij c j and c j max c ij benefit criteria 24 r ij a j c ij a j b ij a j a ij and a j min a ij cost criteria step 5 for calculation of weighted normalised fuzzy decision matrix v normalised value of r ij is then multiplied with criteria weight w j j 1 2 n 25 v ij r ij w j where v v ij m x n i 1 2 m j 1 2 n step 6 the computation of fuzzy ideal solution fpis and fuzzy negative ideal solution fnis are determined as 26 a v 1 v 2 v n 27 a v 1 v 2 v n where

section is to demonstrate how decision associated with the best suitable alternative for multi storeyed residential building is made by the proposed model for this purpose pairwise fuzzy comparison matrices are carried out using tfn for all the criteria as well as indicators shown in tables 3 7 and their final weights are determined table 8 for the alternative selection the current case pertains to decisions associated with appropriate wwt system selection for multi storeyed buildings g 30 with a population equivalent of 890 primarily survey was undertaken to identify widely used treatment technologies and are described in the following sub section linguistic and corresponding fuzzy evaluation matrices for the selected alternatives are computed followed by a weighted normalised fuzzy decision matrix presented in tables 9 12 finally the distance of each alternative from positive and negative ideal solution is shown in table 13 which illustrates the final ranking as well 4 1 identification of the wwt systems for the residential township asp in this treatment process organic contents are aerated and digested by the air supplied through air blowers and aerobic microorganisms form biological floc solid and treated wastewater is then separated in the final clarifier sbr it is an improved form of asp in which the whole treatment cycle i e fill react settle draw and idle occurs in a single reactor tank after filling wastewater in the tank aeration is initiated for a fixed time until the tank is filled and then aeration is turned off to enable biomass to settle inside the tank mbr it is the integration of the membrane process with the biological wastewater process the membranes are used as a barrier to remove solids that are formed during the biological process resulting in a clean pathogen free effluent it is one of the widely used treatment processes mbbr in this system biomass is developed on biofilm biofilm carriers are attached to numerous small plastic media to decompose organic matter from the effluent of the aeration tank the aeration grid which ensures a constant supply of oxygen aids the media mix in the tank and organic matter is effectively broken down due to additional oxygen dosiwam this system is based on natural biodegradation has two major treatment modules i stabilization tank where greywater treatment is carried out ii malaprabha digester is used for blackwater treatment here the novel concept of environmental floors in the multi storeyed residential building is introduced 6 the term environmental floors are designated to the refuge floors where stabilization tanks are positioned keeping the standard refuge area vacant the treatment works on the concept of collecting wastewater from the above located environmental floor refuge floor treating with stabilization tank and distributing treated water to below located floors which ensure gravity government the second treatment module i e malaprabha digester is positioned underground with anaerobic digestion allows recovery of energy in the form of biogas sbt in this eco friendly treatment setup developed and patented by dr h s shankar the fundamental natural process of nature are brought together viz respiration photosynthesis and mineral weathering in a layered media with the integration of microorganisms which carry out the process of decontamination in the overhead or underground tanks namely bioreactors in addition these tanks are free from any moving parts with no requirement of outside mechanical aeration resulting minimal amount of energy consumption 5 result and discussion the current study is focused on the comparative assessment of four mechanised and two non mechanised wwt systems widely applied for multi storeyed housing societies using fuzzy mcdm methodology integrated with lca and lcca with this approach four main criteria and nineteen indicators were finalised by a thorough literature review and experts interviews pairwise comparisons were carried out from the data collected using the nine point scale and the relative importance of main criteria and indicators were defined using fahp consistency checking for experts judgment was determined using a consistency ratio which was observed to be less than 0 1 this ensures strong consistency amongst experts judgment as can be observed in the process of weighing and ranking of four main criteria economic criteria ranked first by all the experts this can be justified that affordable treatment solution is a key concern for developing country like india where people are seeking a low cost viable treatment option which can help in reducing the burden on the economy environmental criteria obtained the second rank which indicates responsibilities to safeguard global ecosystems and conserve biodiversity following that technological and socio cultural criteria hold third and fourth rank respectively performance features related to technological aspects are one of the key factors in the selection procedure the lowest rank of socio cultural criteria was not unexpected as most of the studies that have evaluated wwt systems sustainability have a primary focus on environmental and or economic aspects neglecting the socio cultural dimension 37 38 amongst all indicators npw 0 1737 within the lcca dimension was chosen as the first rank this sole indicator comprises capex opex and end of the life cost i e cost recovered after dismantling and recycling of used materials of the treatment system like other emerging economies this indicator has become increasingly important in the case of the indian economy as well hence more the npw less preferred the treatment system experts ranked land requirement 0 1303 as the second most chosen indicator the land constraint is a major concern in the densely populated indian cities where vertical construction is the current trend 5 as a result technology with less land consumption is mostly preferred also land consumption has a major impact on capex next energy consumption 0 1051 ranked third crucial indicator for treatment system selection since indian electricity generation is mainly hard coal based was found to be the main reason for many detrimental impacts associated with environmental and economic dimensions thus the selected treatment system should either be more energy efficient or energy independent removal efficiency 0 0954 indicator within environmental dimension which is defined as treatment system s ability to produce effluent as per monitoring parameter obtained the fourth rank next reliability 0 0792 possesses fifth rank technical and mechanical reliability are the major aspects of treatment system selection to gain desirable effluent quality and it is noteworthy that mechanised treatment systems are more prone to electromechanical failure which has a great impact on removal efficiency revenue generation 0 0718 was preferred on the sixth rank by all the experts revenue generated from recovered resources i e treated effluent which can reduce withdrawal of freshwater biogas as energy substitute plays a significant role in treatment system selection the flexibility 0 0717 indicator has the seventh rank in the analysis which represents the importance of upgradation in the treatment capacity due to unpredictably additional hydraulic and organic loading and is significant in assessing the robustness of the treatment system gwp 0 0504 ranked eighth is much detrimental for ecosystems electricity consumption and the upstream manufacturing process of chemicals required for the o m phase of the treatment system were found to be the main reason for gwp impact furthermore durability 0 0496 obtained the ninth rank the treatment system should have a maximum technological life span with minimal o m thus helping in achieving environmental and economical sustainability the next indicator ranked tenth by the expert was replicability 0 0381 which is crucial since the rate of increase in population especially in a country like india demands a treatment system that can be easily replicated and is simple enough in design considerations i e reliance on technical expertise should be as minimum as possible next ep 0 0379 indicator ranked eleventh is based on organics and nutrients released through the effluent this signifies the importance of the effluent removal efficiency of the selected treatment system the stakeholders acceptance 0 0378 ranked on the twelfth which shows the importance of engagement of stakeholders in treatment system selection since their involvement could help in creating sustainable change and increase the perception of success in treatment plant implementation noise impact 0 0203 obtained the thirteenth rank in the analysis primarily the source from mechanised treatment system it mainly affects the people with ground floor residence nearer to treatment system according to all experts the indicator manpower requirement 0 0171 ranked on the fourteenth more the complex system more will be the requirement of skilled manpower which can influence opex visual impact 0 0085 ranked fifteenth represents visual disturbance due to the infrastructure of the treatment system in the premises of the building next odour generation 0 0054 ranked sixteenth odour management is of utmost importance as its contaminant emission has a direct impact on human health 39 pcop 0 0031 and odp 0 0030 which show harmful environmental impact have seventeenth and eighteenth rank respectively system s complexity 0 0017 was the least preferred indicator obtained nineteenth ranked the least preference of this indicator is in agreement with other research 40 after defining weights and ranks of main criteria and indicators f topsis evaluation was carried out to obtain ranks of each alternative i e wwt system by evaluating them with respect to each indicator shown in table 13 the ranking represents dosiwam as the most preferred treatment system with a score of 0 647 this shows that experts gave the highest preference for many of the qualitative criteria in addition quantitative data related to lca and lcca for dosiwam determines its environmental and economical sustainability from its ability to treat wastewater without energy and elimination of land usage by incorporating treatment units within the building i e on environmental floors furthermore revenue generation in the form of biogas production from underground human night soil based malaprabha digester of dosiwam can help in the replacement of conventional energy i e cooking fuel liquefied petroleum gas its design simplicity proves independency on skilled manpower in addition non reliability of electromechanical equipment flexibility towards upgradation and elimination of noise due to non mechanised way of treating wastewater offers excellent potential towards treatment system selection although dosiwam has a high eutrophication potential ep and low removal efficiency than other mechanised treatment systems as can be seen from 16 of the 19 indicators dosiwam was found to be highly sustainable mbr system was found to be the second most preferred treatment system with a score of 0 328 this can be attributed due to the fact of its ability for less land requirement compared to other treatment systems i e sbr mbbr asp and sbt mbr s high efficiency in denitrification low sludge formation and less involvement of manpower in the process are mainly the reasons behind its preference over other systems also the effluent quality offered by mbr is exceptionally high whereas sbr and mbbr produce good quality effluent than asp sbt and dosiwam 5 sbt with a score of 0 315 was ranked the third most preferred treatment system this eco friendly treatment technology is free from any moving part except the pump thus has minimal impact on noise pollution in addition the process is odourless has low electricity consumption and skilled manpower although this bioconversion process has a higher land footprint its good removal efficiency simplicity in operation and affordability make it a reasonably preferred alternative next sbr with a score of 0 265 gained the fourth rank has better removal efficiency than asp and dosiwam and consumes less land for the treatment process when compared with asp mbbr with a score of 0 199 and asp with a score of 0 195 was ranked as 4th and 5th preferred alternatives respectively more mechanised operations in the case of the mbbr system results in high energy consumption which ultimately affects environmental and economic dimensions asp has satisfactory performance in fulfilling acceptable effluent standards 5 with this fact that no developer is willing to engage land for utility services especially in metro cities its high land occupancy due to intense aeration process based treatment greatly influences the capex as far as reliability durability and flexibility are concerned asp was evaluated as least preferred than other alternatives thus as per the clear score obtained from the topsis assessment dosiwam was found to be the alternative nearest to the ideal solution whereas amongst other mechanised treatment systems mbr was preferred over sbr mbbr and asp and this obtained results are in agreement with other studies 5 13 6 sensitivity analysis to assess the reliability and robustness of the final ranking it is necessary to examine how sensitive each of the main criteria weights are the ranking order of alternatives is mostly reliant on weights of main criteria and minor variations in relative weights can result in significant changes in the final ranking thus the sensitivity analysis was conducted with considerations of five scenarios where criteria weights were changed to evaluate their effect on the final ranking of alternatives in the first scenario all the four main criteria were considered to be equally important followed to that in the second scenario one of the four main criteria at a time was considered to be more important weight equal to 75 than the other three main criteria which were considered to have equal importance and so on in next scenarios results of all scenarios are represented in table 14 and graphically in fig 5 where variation in the outcome i e ranking of alternatives is shown after analysing the results amongst the five different scenarios dosiwam was identified to be the best suitable alternative for 1st 2nd and 3rd scenarios whereas 4th and 5th scenarios represent mbr and sbt as optimal treatment systems respectively environmental criteria with higher weight suggest dosiwam as best suitable while sbt as least suitable alternative and vice versa after exchanging high priority weight to equal to 75 to socio cultural aspect alternatively mbr ranked first in the ranking if the higher weight is afforded to technological criteria whereas sbr possesses the lowest rank thus the sensitivity result shows that in three out of five scenarios 75 relative percentage change in criteria weight does not affect the first rank of the dosiwam system further the dosiwam system is economic and environmentally sustainable but least feasible if the socio cultural aspect is taken into consideration 7 conclusions although centralization in wastewater treatment is popular across the world this concept is now being challenged particularly in rapidly growing indian cities where a shortage of freshwater resources is a looming danger and decentralization appears to be the more logical solution with the availability of various mechanised treatment options the current study illustrates the novel concept of non mechanised way of treating wastewater by gravity govern dosiwam system hypothetically installed at environmental floors of the multi storeyed building the methodological framework was developed with fuzzy mcdm technique which encompasses a set of sustainability indicators using lca and lcca approach for comparative evaluation of widely used six mechanised and non mechanised wastewater treatment systems especially for the multi storeyed residential societies the attributes derived from lca lcca technological and social aspects assist in concluding conclusions that are more justifiable creating a transparent decision making process as compared to standalone ahp and topsis where crisp values are more prone to vagueness and uncertainty the current method is benefited with a fuzzy environment since the conversion of the linguistic term into fuzzy numbers can greatly reduce the ambiguity and gives much robust result experts judgments were quantified with linguistic terms and further parameterized by tfn characteristics of an appropriate treatment system are denoted by four main sustainability criteria and nineteen indicators which are then translated into the mathematical algorithm and further evaluated to determine their weights all the main criteria and indicators are finalised by a thorough literature review and experts opinions according to obtained results amongst the four sustainability criteria economic criteria using lcca followed by environmental criteria using lca are mostly influential towards alternative selection moreover ranking results illustrated that dosiwam is the most preferred alternative due to its non mechanised way of treating wastewater eliminates energy consumption for the treatment process with the fact that land availability is a major constraint in urban areas and no developer is willing to utilize the land for treatment services the novel concept of dosiwam installation at environmental floors of the residential building can help in eradicating land usage dosiwam s capability of recovery of resources in the form of biogas can replace cooking fuel lpg it has been observed that the experts prefer mostly natural treatment systems since they are more sustainable in environmental and economic considerations nevertheless in the scenario where all four sustainability aspects are taken into account the selection of advanced mechanised treatment systems like mbr sbr and mbbr can be prioritised amongst mechanised wastewater treatment systems mbr is preferred over mbbr sbr and asp due to its high effluent quality less land requirement and elimination of secondary and tertiary filtration sbt treatment system exhibits the third rank when the economic dimension is prioritised over other sustainability aspects in addition this eco friendly treatment technology has an odourless process and low electricity consumption followed to this sbr and mbbr were ranked third and fourth respectively sbr mainly has a low land footprint when compared with asp the effluent quality produced by treatment technology is considered as an important performance evaluation factor sbr and mbbr exhibit better removal efficiency than asp and dosiwam high requirement of area low quality effluent are the reasons behind the least preferred asp system since alternatives ranking is mostly reliant on weights of main criteria and minor variations in relative weights can result in significant changes in the final ranking thus sensitivity analysis was carried out corresponding to prioritisation of main criteria out of five considered scenarios major findings of sensitivity analysis shows that dosiwam is the most sustainable wwt system in addition collection and treatment of human waste for the production of renewable energy could be well coordinated with the most significant cleanliness campaign clean india mission by the government of india in the future this methodological framework could be extended by incorporating numerous local and global decision makers and collecting their inputs for additional decision making parameters to improve the effectiveness of the model further the same methodology could be applied for the selection of optimum treatment solution by including other finite available alternatives declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

13182,the current study proposes a comprehensive fuzzy formulated multi criteria decision making mcdm framework with integrated life cycle assessment lca and life cycle cost assessment lcca approach for selection of best suitable wastewater treatment wwt system especially for multi storeyed residential buildings by utilising a thorough literature survey experts opinions and questionnaires the study attempts to identify four dimensions of sustainability with associated key nineteen indicators furthermore the study is benefited by undertaking quantitative parameters related to environmental and economic sustainability assessed by lca and lcca respectively the proposed three phase methodological framework illustrates the identification of widely used wwt systems in the first phase followed by fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp assessment for criteria and indicators screening and finalisation in the second phase and ranking of alternative by fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution ftopsis in the third phase moreover the current paper suggests a novel approach of incorporating environmental floor in multi storeyed building where gravity governed nature based wastewater treatment tanks of decentralized on site integrated waste management dosiwam system can be positioned to test the proposed framework the sustainability of dosiwam system is compared with five widely used wastewater treatment systems viz membrane bioreactor mbr moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr sequencing batch reactors sbr activated sludge process asp soil biotechnology sbt results of alternative ranking indicate dosiwam allocated at environmental floors as the best suitable option followed by the second third and fourth rank of mbr sbt and sbr respectively whereas mbbr and asp are the least preferred it has been observed that the experts prefer mostly natural treatment systems since they are more sustainable in environmental and economic considerations in addition by changing the weights of the main criteria sensitivity analysis is carried out considering five scenarios which signifies in three out of five scenarios relative percentage change in criteria weight does not affect the first rank of the dosiwam system the developed framework successfully facilitates a reliable base for the selection of the best suitable wwt system for multi storeyed residential building and could be made available to the relevant local planning authority to incentivize the effort undertaken for the welfare of citizens as well as the

residential building 1 introduction india as the world s largest freshwater consumer country is experiencing a severe water shortage it has been noticed from the comprehensive research conducted by the world bank that water shortage is a looming danger for the nation that has just 4 of the world s water resources irrespective of 17 of the world s population as per central pollution control board cpcb by 2030 india s water demand is forecast to increase up to 1 5 trillion cubic meters the major issues that have contributed to the depletion of water resources are the lack of adequate facilities and awareness about treating wastewater moreover improperly financed and under designed infrastructure facilities for wastewater treatment result in the direct dumping of household wastewater into rivers or lakes furthermore inadequately treated wastewater containing chromium which is the most hazardous and highly toxic contaminant even at low concentration can cause harmful impacts on the environment and several advanced treatment processes are essential for its removal 1 also it is very important to ensure harmful toxic metals from effluent does not affect marine life 2 the traditional centralized wastewater treatment wwt method pertains to the collection and transportation of wastewater to a treatment facility has much detrimental impact on nature as well as human health in this context decentralization with emerging innovative treatment solutions would help in achieving significant strategic advantages it would not only drives opportunities to lower down the burden on centralized systems but help in establishing more scalable and portable wwt options one such example is dosiwam decentralized on site integrated waste management system 3 2 research motive the current wastewater management practices specifically meant for residential townships need a paradigm shift despite the fact that the government has mandated treatment for residential societies with a built up area of more than 2000 square meters 30 of the existing conventional sewage treatment plants were found to be non functional 4 as stated by kalbar et al 5 hi tech mechanised treatment systems can be appropriate for the urban context but as far as multi storeyed housing societies are concerned these systems are usually chosen by the developer on the basis of past experience available cost and resources constraints which inherently has numerous problems and challenges such as a all these systems are energy driven with intermittent supply and lack of alternate source increase the risk of system failure b residents are burdened by the economic aspects of skilled workers deployment for scientific handling and yearly pay consent for operation and maintenance o m to municipal corporations c ground floor residents are subjected to unbearable noise and vibration if a treatment system is improperly allocated in the premises 6 this has collectively triggered the need for a treatment system which is socially acceptable economically viable environmentally sustainable and technologically simplified with this regards the eminent challenge is the selection of treatment system from the finite available options in order to take the first step towards sustainability achievement it is of utmost importance to carry out the selection process of an appropriate wwt system with a carefully designed methodological framework multi criteria decision making mcdm approaches are one of the most popular and widely used techniques in recent years 7 mcdm is a statistical system that allows users to select a decisive solution in a considerably reduced timeline for a specific problem such as wwt system selection and simplifies the selection process when multiple conflicting criteria exist furthermore as explored by many researchers decision making processes are availed with numerous methods where decision makers are bound to select the alternative with substantial benefits the most commonly implemented approach for solving a complex unstructured problem is analytical hierarchy process ahp 8 and it has been well integrated with other techniques such as ahp multidimensional scaling mds 9 ahp grey relation analysis gra 10 11 while ahp has its own set of advantages it also has certain drawbacks to tackle this anp was proposed as an improved and sophisticated version of ahp by gencer and gürpinar 12 likewise numerous hybrid methods have been developed to overcome the drawbacks of one another such as hybrid life cycle assessment lca based fuzzy mcdm 13 sadr et al 14 employed hybrid multi criteria decision analysis mcda with multi objective optimization moo and developed a tool for optimization of indian wastewater treatment technologies balkema et al 15 implemented a method analogous to lca moreover to deal with the fuzziness of decision makers fuzzy set theory has been incorporated in the traditional mcdm technique 8 16 18 thus the efficacy of the treatment system can be well ascertained by the mcdm approach which not only aids in the selection of the best suitable treatment alternative but also minimises the selection complexity 19 in the current study an improved version of fuzzy mcdm i e integrated fuzzy ahp topsis is carried out using life cycle assessment lca and life cycle cost assessment lcca approach to use their advantages for the selection of appropriate wwt system for multi storeyed residential building consequently using lca and lcca related databases and the statistical user interface an excel based soft tool is developed to perform every calculation of the fuzzy ahp topsis simple and fast this study builds on the work previously presented by dewalkar shastri 6 where a novel concept of incorporation of the environmental floor in the multi storeyed building was suggested the term environmental floor is designated to the refuge floor where dosiwam system s stabilization tanks greywater treatment are positioned keeping standard refuge area vacant and human night soil based malaprabha digesters blackwater treatment are located underground the complete treatment process is gravity governed with generated wastewater being collected from above located floors i e above refuge floor followed by the treatment at environmental floor and redistribution of treated effluent to lower floors fig 1 the major advantages are minimal area requirement by these treatment tanks as the amount of grey wastewater produced by intermittent floors determines treatment capacity in addition land occupancy in the premises of the building for the treatment process could be fairly eliminated moreover the whole treatment process is non mechanised and works on gravity this ensures no requirement of electromechanical mechanisms which could cause additional complications on the floor in the final section to illustrate the applicability of the suggested approach in a real life environment dosiwam allocated at environmental floors is compared with other widely used wastewater treatment systems specifically used for multi storeyed housing societies 3 research methodology in the process of selection of appropriate wastewater treatment system for multi storeyed residential building the three phase methodology is employed as shown in fig 2 first widely used wwt technologies implemented for multi storeyed housing societies are identified in the second phase the research employs the fuzzy ahp method and is computed using lca and lcca approaches in this phase decision makers vagueness is taken into consideration and the decision making hierarchy is finalised followed by the determination of weights of criteria and indicators by pairwise comparison matrices and in the final third phase fuzzy topsis is applied to evaluate alternatives and the process of the final ranking with several options available for wwt including mechanised and non mechanised selection of the best suitable alternative is quite difficult and is affected by many vital qualitative and quantitative parameters in the current study the problem associated with the selection of the wwt system is hierarchized into four levels the ultimate goal of the decision is positioned at the top level in the second and third levels criteria and indicators are assigned respectively followed by the bottom level which includes alternatives to be selected fig 3 the key research tool used in the current study involves the design and development of questionnaires from environmental experts professionals local constraints are the most important factor that can affect the decision making process hence the current study is benefited by involving a number of local experts and collecting their opinion academic professionals consultants dealing with wwt solutions and other research environmental domain experts were finalised for computing mainly qualitative data in order to express the relative significance of the criteria and indicators in pairwise comparisons experts were asked to carry out the assessment according to the scale of relative importance table 1 the flexibility of the scale gives freedom to experts for expressing their opinion and these observations were then translated to fuzzy numbers 3 1 phase i establishment of main criteria and indicators as stated by nathan et al 20 criteria and indicators included in the assessment should be carefully chosen since too many indicators may weaken the purpose whereas too few indicators may be insufficient to communicate the message sustainability indicators play the most vital role in the selection of appropriate wwt technology and these can be identified through several literatures 15 21 22 the selection of treatment process includes the assessment of multiple factors that must need to be incorporated in order to achieve the goal in this study the literature review is utilized as a source of collecting secondary data for selecting criteria indicators and this process was found to be commonly practiced by many researchers subsequently local constraints are the most important factor that can affect the decision making process thus local experts opinions are also assigned for screening and finalisation of criteria and indicators the concept of sustainability for the selection of the wwt system is divided into four main dimensions i e main criteria viz environmental economical technological and socio cultural quantitative and qualitative data are estimated separately since qualitative data indicators could not be directly quantified e g those associated with social indicators thus are quantified by a nine point scale whereas quantitative data indicators are estimated directly moreover the quantitative information for some qualitative data such as noise and odour were not available from plant technology that could be recorded in decibels and odour unit per cubic meter respectively hence both are considered as qualitative only to attain optimum achievement quantitative criteria are evaluated by lca and lcca with inclusive of field data collected from treatment plants such as land occupation the requirement of workers and their wages effluent data electricity consumption by electromechanical equipment and the requirement of chemicals for disinfection environmental assessment using the lca approach is the first main quantitative criteria considered which has six sets of indicators viz global warming potential gwp eutrophication potential ep ozone depletion potential odp photochemical oxidation potential pcop removal efficiency and energy consumption the generic eq 1 shown below is used for lca calculation 23 24 where lca indicators are based on characterisation factors provided in cml ia version 4 1 for the indian construction database removal efficiency is evaluated using eq 2 25 quantitative parameters like removal efficiency and energy consumption are collected from field scale wwt systems 1 indicator i characteriazation factor i m i 2 eg a 1 3 e tss e bod 3 e cod the second main quantitative criteria represent the economic aspect which is performed by lcca using the net present worth npw method eq 3 as per indian standards is 13174 part ii 26 where future cash flow is modified pertaining to the base date and discounting factor is calculated with consideration of inflation and interest rate eq 4 in the current methodological framework the base date is considered as jan 2019 economic criteria is analysed by four sub criteria indicators npw land occupation measured in terms of m2 kld the requirement of manpower and revenue generation i e recovery of resources that reflects the ability of wwt technology intended for discharge of effluent with desirable standards and energy recovery revenue generation in the form of human night soil based biogas energy can help in the replacement and or reduction of burden on conventional energy lcca incorporates capital expenditure capex which includes the cost of construction materials civil work required initial electromechanical setup and wages of workers operational expenditure opex includes the cost of electricity and chemical consumption throughout the life span of the treatment system repair and replacement of electromechanical equipment 3 npw capex opex upwf upwf 1 d n 1 d 1 d n 4 discount rate 1 interset rate 1 inflation rate 1 the next main qualitative criteria is technical which has the following indicators i reliability it is analysed as the treatment system s ability to attain adequate performance during a specific period in specific circumstances 27 electromechanical reliability and performance of treatment plant are the major aspects that need to be taken into consideration 28 and are characterised by their working efficiency and probability of dysfunction during a specified life span ii durability when it comes to durability the lifespan of treatment technology plays a vital role here all the treatment technologies are compared with the same scale of 50 years of lifespan and the durability aspect is considered with an emphasis on minimal electromechanical spare parts replacement and maintenance iii flexibility the treatment process should be able to withstand the variety of flow rates as well as increased organic loading thus the treatment system should be flexible enough if up gradation is required and adequately robust with minimal cost requirements flexibility also reflects land accommodation i e adequate space for treatment system for further future expansion if needed and treatment efficiency in routine and emergency operational conditions 29 iv replicability the treatment system which is to be selected should be technologically simple and familiar so that it can be easily and efficiently replicated without relying on technical resources v system s complexity it represents a crucial aspect in the selection process more the complex system more will be the requirement of skilled workers professional operations and specialised equipment with their spare parts requirements for the o m phase indicators associated with the fourth main qualitative criteria i e socio cultural dimension are explained as follows i stakeholders acceptance participation of community people and associated stakeholders are most often ignored nevertheless they play a major role related to the selection and implementation of appropriate treatment technology and thus for treatment plant implementation and further progress civic engagement should be facilitated ii visual impact it refers to the disturbance caused due to infrastructure and electromechanical set up in the premises of the building iii odour generation it denotes the generation of unwanted odour consideration of climatic conditions is an essential aspect biological processes are mostly dependent on temperature variations since the warm atmosphere can speed up the intensity of odour thus local climate plays important role in the selection procedure iv noise impact it represents disturbance generated from electromechanical equipment during the o m phase of the wwt system 3 2 phase ii fuzzy ahp the ahp approach is primarily used in frameworks that include crisp decisions application the classical standalone ahp generates and handles a highly unbalanced decision scale the uncertainty involved with mapping one s decision to a number is not taken into consideration the ranking of the alternatives has no enough precision and the findings are heavily influenced by the individual judgment and preferences of decision makers dms 30 33 it is also observed that being a subjective evaluation of qualitative attributes often results in a vague decision thus due to these inherent uncertainties with regards to human preferences the concept of amalgamation of fuzzy sets developed by zadeh 34 with the use of triangular fuzzy numbers tfns for expressing the weights of criteria results in a more precise process of decision making hence the objectivity of the outcomes in the current methodological framework is strengthened by using the fahp method which is considered to be a powerful approach in mcdm the difference between fuzzy sets and crisp set is fuzzy membership functions is mathematically defined as μ a x allow any real number in 0 1 interval while crisp sets only allow either 0 or 1 the study considered the most often used tfns which is characterised by the real number l m u the lower maximal and upper limit of the membership function is represented by l m u respectively and is denoted as eq 5 whereas the condition of non fuzzy numbers is when l m u 5 μ a x x l m l l x m n x n m m x n 0 otherwise the operations between tfn a 1 l 1 m 1 u 1 and a 2 l 2 m 2 u 2 are represented by the following eqs 6 9 in addition eq 10 shows the mathematical operation for calculating the distance between two tfn 6 a 1 a 2 l 1 m 1 u 1 l 2 m 2 u 2 l 1 l 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 u 2 7 a 1 a 2 l 1 m 1 u 1 l 2 m 2 u 2 l 1 l 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 u 2 8 a 1 a 2 l 1 m 1 u 1 l 2 m 2 u 2 l 1 u 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 l 2 9 a 1 a 2 l 1 m 1 u 1 l 2 m 2 u 2 l 1 u 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 l 2 10 d a 1 a 2 1 3 l 1 l 2 2 m 1 m 2 2 u 1 u 2 2 3 2 1 fuzzy ahp process similar to ahp the first step is to structure the decision making problem with defined criteria which could affect the decision making amongst the alternatives pairwise comparisons are carried out for criteria and indicators as per inputs obtained on the scale of relative importance the comparison matrix is formulated as expressed in eq 11 using tfn by asking dm s judgments of pairwise comparisons for criteria and indicators 11 a 1 a 12 a 1 n a 21 1 a 2 n a n 1 a n 2 1 the next step is the calculation of the relative weights multiple approaches dealing with fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices were suggested however owing to the computational ease the extent analysis method is the most commonly used the extent analysis method proposed by chang 35 is thus implemented for the pairwise comparison and further criteria weights are determined following are the steps of extent analysis let the object set and goal set are x x 1 x 2 x 3 x n and u u 1 u 2 u 3 u n respectively thus the value of m extent analysis for each object is denoted by the sign m gi 1 m gi 2 m gi 3 m gi m i 1 2 3 n where m gi j j 1 2 3 m are tfn after carrying out pairwise comparison the fuzzy synthetic extent of i th object is calculated by the computation of tfn as shown by eq 12 12 si j 1 m m gi j i 1 n j 1 m m gi j 1 where fuzzy operation for tfn is executed as 13 j 1 m m gi j j 1 m l j j 1 m m j j 1 m u j and i 1 n j 1 m m gi j 1 i 1 n l i i 1 n m i i 1 n u i 1 1 i n ui 1 i n mi 1 i n li considering tfn m 1 l 1 m 1 u 1 and m 2 l 2 m 2 u 2 the degree of possibility m 2 m 1 is defined as 14 v m 2 m 1 sup min μ m 1 x μ m 2 y and equivalently expressed as 15 v m 2 m 1 hgt m 1 m 2 μ m 2 d 1 if m 2 m 1 0 if l 1 u 2 l 1 u 2 m 2 u 2 m 1 l 1 otherwise where d is the ordinate of the highest intersection point d between μ m 1 and μ m 2 as shown in fig 4 where the intersection between m 1 and m 2 can be observed for the comparison of m 1 and m 2 both the values of v m 1 m 2 and v m 2 m 1 are necessary the degree of possibility for a convex fuzzy number to be larger than k convex fuzzy numbers m i i 1 2 k can be defined as 16 v m m 1 m 2 m k v m m 1 and m m 2 and m m k min v m m i i 1 2 3 k assume that d a i min v s i s k for k 1 2 n k i then the weight vector is given by 17 w d a 1 d a 2 d a n t where a i i 1 2 3 n are the n elements by normalisation normalised weight vectors are 18 w d a 1 d a 2 d a n t where w is the non fuzzy number 3 3 phase iii fuzzy topsis after defining fuzzy weights of criteria and indicators by f ahp ranking of the appropriate wastewater treatment system is carried out by topsis method developed by hwang and yoon 36 in 1981 where chosen preferred wastewater treatment alternative should be the one that is nearest to the positive ideal solution and farthest to the negative ideal solution the use of fuzzy numbers to assign the relative significance of alternatives is one of the key advantages of using topsis under the fuzzy environment since it is often difficult to tackle the associated uncertainty subjectivity and vagueness with crisp value in real life applications here linguistic terms which are then set to fuzzy numbers are used to map fuzzy decision matrices table 2 step 1 assuming there are m alternative denoted as a a 1 a 2 a 3 a m and n criteria denoted as c c 1 c 2 c 3 c n then performance rating for each expert d k 1 2 3 k is denoted by r k x ijk i 1 2 m j 1 2 n k 1 2 k for alternative a i i 1 2 m to be evaluated against criteria c j j 1 2 n with the membership function μ r k x step 2 determination of aggregate fuzzy rating if r k a k b k c k k 1 2 k r represents fuzzy ratings of all experts in tfn then the aggregate fuzzy rating is specified by r a b c k 1 2 k where 19 a min k a k b 1 k k 1 k b k c max k c k if the fuzzy rating for k th expert is x ijk a ijk b ijk c ijk i 1 2 m j 1 2 n with corresponding criteria weights w ijk then the aggregated fuzzy ratings x ij of the alternatives with respect to each criterion are given by x ij a ij b ij c ij where 20 a ij min k a ijk b ij 1 k k 1 k b ijk c ij max k c ijk step 3 fuzzy decision matrix d for assessment of alternatives wwt systems evaluated against criteria using linguistic variables assigned by the experts is determined by 21 d a 1 a 2 a m x 11 c 1 x 12 c 2 x 1 n c n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x mn i 1 2 m j 1 2 n step 4 linear scale transformation is used for the normalisation process which can be carried out by following eq 22 and for the set of benefit and cost criteria eqs 23 and 24 are used respectively 22 r r ij m x n i 1 2 m j 1 2 n 23 r ij a ij c j b ij c j c ij c j and c j max c ij benefit criteria 24 r ij a j c ij a j b ij a j a ij and a j min a ij cost criteria step 5 for calculation of weighted normalised fuzzy decision matrix v normalised value of r ij is then multiplied with criteria weight w j j 1 2 n 25 v ij r ij w j where v v ij m x n i 1 2 m j 1 2 n step 6 the computation of fuzzy ideal solution fpis and fuzzy negative ideal solution fnis are determined as 26 a v 1 v 2 v n 27 a v 1 v 2 v n where v j max v ijk i 1 2 m j 1 2 n v j min v ijk i 1 2 m j 1 2 n step 7 calculation of distance d i and d i i 1 2 m of each alternative from fpis a and fnis a can be calculated as 28 d i j 1 n d v ij v j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n 29 d i j 1 n d v ij v j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n step 8 calculation of closeness coefficient cc i of each alternative which gives similarity to an ideal solution and ranking order of all alternatives the best alternative is one with the highest cc i and nearest to fpis and farthest to fnis 30 cc i d i d i d i 4 application of the proposed methodological framework the purpose of this section is to demonstrate how decision associated with the best suitable alternative for multi storeyed residential building is made by the proposed model for this purpose pairwise fuzzy comparison matrices are carried out using tfn for all the criteria as well as indicators shown in tables 3 7 and their final weights are determined table 8 for the alternative selection the current case pertains to decisions associated with appropriate wwt system selection for multi storeyed buildings g 30 with a population equivalent of 890 primarily survey was undertaken to identify widely used treatment technologies and are described in the following sub section linguistic and corresponding fuzzy evaluation matrices for the selected alternatives are computed followed by a weighted normalised fuzzy decision matrix presented in tables 9 12 finally the distance of each alternative from positive and negative ideal solution is shown in table 13 which illustrates the final ranking as well 4 1 identification of the wwt systems for the residential township asp in this treatment process organic contents are aerated and digested by the air supplied through air blowers and aerobic microorganisms form biological floc solid and treated wastewater is then separated in the final clarifier sbr it is an improved form of asp in which the whole treatment cycle i e fill react settle draw and idle occurs in a single reactor tank after filling wastewater in the tank aeration is initiated for a fixed time until the tank is filled and then aeration is turned off to enable biomass to settle inside the tank mbr it is the integration of the membrane process with the biological wastewater process the membranes are used as a barrier to remove solids that are formed during the biological process resulting in a clean pathogen free effluent it is one of the widely used treatment processes mbbr in this system biomass is developed on biofilm biofilm carriers are attached to numerous small plastic media to decompose organic matter from the effluent of the aeration tank the aeration grid which ensures a constant supply of oxygen aids the media mix in the tank and organic matter is effectively broken down due to additional oxygen dosiwam this system is based on natural biodegradation has two major treatment modules i stabilization tank where greywater treatment is carried out ii malaprabha digester is used for blackwater treatment here the novel concept of environmental floors in the multi storeyed residential building is introduced 6 the term environmental floors are designated to the refuge floors where stabilization tanks are positioned keeping the standard refuge area vacant the treatment works on the concept of collecting wastewater from the above located environmental floor refuge floor treating with stabilization tank and distributing treated water to below located floors which ensure gravity government the second treatment module i e malaprabha digester is positioned underground with anaerobic digestion allows recovery of energy in the form of biogas sbt in this eco friendly treatment setup developed and patented by dr h s shankar the fundamental natural process of nature are brought together viz respiration photosynthesis and mineral weathering in a layered media with the integration of microorganisms which carry out the process of decontamination in the overhead or underground tanks namely bioreactors in addition these tanks are free from any moving parts with no requirement of outside mechanical aeration resulting minimal amount of energy consumption 5 result and discussion the current study is focused on the comparative assessment of four mechanised and two non mechanised wwt systems widely applied for multi storeyed housing societies using fuzzy mcdm methodology integrated with lca and lcca with this approach four main criteria and nineteen indicators were finalised by a thorough literature review and experts interviews pairwise comparisons were carried out from the data collected using the nine point scale and the relative importance of main criteria and indicators were defined using fahp consistency checking for experts judgment was determined using a consistency ratio which was observed to be less than 0 1 this ensures strong consistency amongst experts judgment as can be observed in the process of weighing and ranking of four main criteria economic criteria ranked first by all the experts this can be justified that affordable treatment solution is a key concern for developing country like india where people are seeking a low cost viable treatment option which can help in reducing the burden on the economy environmental criteria obtained the second rank which indicates responsibilities to safeguard global ecosystems and conserve biodiversity following that technological and socio cultural criteria hold third and fourth rank respectively performance features related to technological aspects are one of the key factors in the selection procedure the lowest rank of socio cultural criteria was not unexpected as most of the studies that have evaluated wwt systems sustainability have a primary focus on environmental and or economic aspects neglecting the socio cultural dimension 37 38 amongst all indicators npw 0 1737 within the lcca dimension was chosen as the first rank this sole indicator comprises capex opex and end of the life cost i e cost recovered after dismantling and recycling of used materials of the treatment system like other emerging economies this indicator has become increasingly important in the case of the indian economy as well hence more the npw less preferred the treatment system experts ranked land requirement 0 1303 as the second most chosen indicator the land constraint is a major concern in the densely populated indian cities where vertical construction is the current trend 5 as a result technology with less land consumption is mostly preferred also land consumption has a major impact on capex next energy consumption 0 1051 ranked third crucial indicator for treatment system selection since indian electricity generation is mainly hard coal based was found to be the main reason for many detrimental impacts associated with environmental and economic dimensions thus the selected treatment system should either be more energy efficient or energy independent removal efficiency 0 0954 indicator within environmental dimension which is defined as treatment system s ability to produce effluent as per monitoring parameter obtained the fourth rank next reliability 0 0792 possesses fifth rank technical and mechanical reliability are the major aspects of treatment system selection to gain desirable effluent quality and it is noteworthy that mechanised treatment systems are more prone to electromechanical failure which has a great impact on removal efficiency revenue generation 0 0718 was preferred on the sixth rank by all the experts revenue generated from recovered resources i e treated effluent which can reduce withdrawal of freshwater biogas as energy substitute plays a significant role in treatment system selection the flexibility 0 0717 indicator has the seventh rank in the analysis which represents the importance of upgradation in the treatment capacity due to unpredictably additional hydraulic and organic loading and is significant in assessing the robustness of the treatment system gwp 0 0504 ranked eighth is much detrimental for ecosystems electricity consumption and the upstream manufacturing process of chemicals required for the o m phase of the treatment system were found to be the main reason for gwp impact furthermore durability 0 0496 obtained the ninth rank the treatment system should have a maximum technological life span with minimal o m thus helping in achieving environmental and economical sustainability the next indicator ranked tenth by the expert was replicability 0 0381 which is crucial since the rate of increase in population especially in a country like india demands a treatment system that can be easily replicated and is simple enough in design considerations i e reliance on technical expertise should be as minimum as possible next ep 0 0379 indicator ranked eleventh is based on organics and nutrients released through the effluent this signifies the importance of the effluent removal efficiency of the selected treatment system the stakeholders acceptance 0 0378 ranked on the twelfth which shows the importance of engagement of stakeholders in treatment system selection since their involvement could help in creating sustainable change and increase the perception of success in treatment plant implementation noise impact 0 0203 obtained the thirteenth rank in the analysis primarily the source from mechanised treatment system it mainly affects the people with ground floor residence nearer to treatment system according to all experts the indicator manpower requirement 0 0171 ranked on the fourteenth more the complex system more will be the requirement of skilled manpower which can influence opex visual impact 0 0085 ranked fifteenth represents visual disturbance due to the infrastructure of the treatment system in the premises of the building next odour generation 0 0054 ranked sixteenth odour management is of utmost importance as its contaminant emission has a direct impact on human health 39 pcop 0 0031 and odp 0 0030 which show harmful environmental impact have seventeenth and eighteenth rank respectively system s complexity 0 0017 was the least preferred indicator obtained nineteenth ranked the least preference of this indicator is in agreement with other research 40 after defining weights and ranks of main criteria and indicators f topsis evaluation was carried out to obtain ranks of each alternative i e wwt system by evaluating them with respect to each indicator shown in table 13 the ranking represents dosiwam as the most preferred treatment system with a score of 0 647 this shows that experts gave the highest preference for many of the qualitative criteria in addition quantitative data related to lca and lcca for dosiwam determines its environmental and economical sustainability from its ability to treat wastewater without energy and elimination of land usage by incorporating treatment units within the building i e on environmental floors furthermore revenue generation in the form of biogas production from underground human night soil based malaprabha digester of dosiwam can help in the replacement of conventional energy i e cooking fuel liquefied petroleum gas its design simplicity proves independency on skilled manpower in addition non reliability of electromechanical equipment flexibility towards upgradation and elimination of noise due to non mechanised way of treating wastewater offers excellent potential towards treatment system selection although dosiwam has a high eutrophication potential ep and low removal efficiency than other mechanised treatment systems as can be seen from 16 of the 19 indicators dosiwam was found to be highly sustainable mbr system was found to be the second most preferred treatment system with a score of 0 328 this can be attributed due to the fact of its ability for less land requirement compared to other treatment systems i e sbr mbbr asp and sbt mbr s high efficiency in denitrification low sludge formation and less involvement of manpower in the process are mainly the reasons behind its preference over other systems also the effluent quality offered by mbr is exceptionally high whereas sbr and mbbr produce good quality effluent than asp sbt and dosiwam 5 sbt with a score of 0 315 was ranked the third most preferred treatment system this eco friendly treatment technology is free from any moving part except the pump thus has minimal impact on noise pollution in addition the process is odourless has low electricity consumption and skilled manpower although this bioconversion process has a higher land footprint its good removal efficiency simplicity in operation and affordability make it a reasonably preferred alternative next sbr with a score of 0 265 gained the fourth rank has better removal efficiency than asp and dosiwam and consumes less land for the treatment process when compared with asp mbbr with a score of 0 199 and asp with a score of 0 195 was ranked as 4th and 5th preferred alternatives respectively more mechanised operations in the case of the mbbr system results in high energy consumption which ultimately affects environmental and economic dimensions asp has satisfactory performance in fulfilling acceptable effluent standards 5 with this fact that no developer is willing to engage land for utility services especially in metro cities its high land occupancy due to intense aeration process based treatment greatly influences the capex as far as reliability durability and flexibility are concerned asp was evaluated as least preferred than other alternatives thus as per the clear score obtained from the topsis assessment dosiwam was found to be the alternative nearest to the ideal solution whereas amongst other mechanised treatment systems mbr was preferred over sbr mbbr and asp and this obtained results are in agreement with other studies 5 13 6 sensitivity analysis to assess the reliability and robustness of the final ranking it is necessary to examine how sensitive each of the main criteria weights are the ranking order of alternatives is mostly reliant on weights of main criteria and minor variations in relative weights can result in significant changes in the final ranking thus the sensitivity analysis was conducted with considerations of five scenarios where criteria weights were changed to evaluate their effect on the final ranking of alternatives in the first scenario all the four main criteria were considered to be equally important followed to that in the second scenario one of the four main criteria at a time was considered to be more important weight equal to 75 than the other three main criteria which were considered to have equal importance and so on in next scenarios results of all scenarios are represented in table 14 and graphically in fig 5 where variation in the outcome i e ranking of alternatives is shown after analysing the results amongst the five different scenarios dosiwam was identified to be the best suitable alternative for 1st 2nd and 3rd scenarios whereas 4th and 5th scenarios represent mbr and sbt as optimal treatment systems respectively environmental criteria with higher weight suggest dosiwam as best suitable while sbt as least suitable alternative and vice versa after exchanging high priority weight to equal to 75 to socio cultural aspect alternatively mbr ranked first in the ranking if the higher weight is afforded to technological criteria whereas sbr possesses the lowest rank thus the sensitivity result shows that in three out of five scenarios 75 relative percentage change in criteria weight does not affect the first rank of the dosiwam system further the dosiwam system is economic and environmentally sustainable but least feasible if the socio cultural aspect is taken into consideration 7 conclusions although centralization in wastewater treatment is popular across the world this concept is now being challenged particularly in rapidly growing indian cities where a shortage of freshwater resources is a looming danger and decentralization appears to be the more logical solution with the availability of various mechanised treatment options the current study illustrates the novel concept of non mechanised way of treating wastewater by gravity govern dosiwam system hypothetically installed at environmental floors of the multi storeyed building the methodological framework was developed with fuzzy mcdm technique which encompasses a set of sustainability indicators using lca and lcca approach for comparative evaluation of widely used six mechanised and non mechanised wastewater treatment systems especially for the multi storeyed residential societies the attributes derived from lca lcca technological and social aspects assist in concluding conclusions that are more justifiable creating a transparent decision making process as compared to standalone ahp and topsis where crisp values are more prone to vagueness and uncertainty the current method is benefited with a fuzzy environment since the conversion of the linguistic term into fuzzy numbers can greatly reduce the ambiguity and gives much robust result experts judgments were quantified with linguistic terms and further parameterized by tfn characteristics of an appropriate treatment system are denoted by four main sustainability criteria and nineteen indicators which are then translated into the mathematical algorithm and further evaluated to determine their weights all the main criteria and indicators are finalised by a thorough literature review and experts opinions according to obtained results amongst the four sustainability criteria economic criteria using lcca followed by environmental criteria using lca are mostly influential towards alternative selection moreover ranking results illustrated that dosiwam is the most preferred alternative due to its non mechanised way of treating wastewater eliminates energy consumption for the treatment process with the fact that land availability is a major constraint in urban areas and no developer is willing to utilize the land for treatment services the novel concept of dosiwam installation at environmental floors of the residential building can help in eradicating land usage dosiwam s capability of recovery of resources in the form of biogas can replace cooking fuel lpg it has been observed that the experts prefer mostly natural treatment systems since they are more sustainable in environmental and economic considerations nevertheless in the scenario where all four sustainability aspects are taken into account the selection of advanced mechanised treatment systems like mbr sbr and mbbr can be prioritised amongst mechanised wastewater treatment systems mbr is preferred over mbbr sbr and asp due to its high effluent quality less land requirement and elimination of secondary and tertiary filtration sbt treatment system exhibits the third rank when the economic dimension is prioritised over other sustainability aspects in addition this eco friendly treatment technology has an odourless process and low electricity consumption followed to this sbr and mbbr were ranked third and fourth respectively sbr mainly has a low land footprint when compared with asp the effluent quality produced by treatment technology is considered as an important performance evaluation factor sbr and mbbr exhibit better removal efficiency than asp and dosiwam high requirement of area low quality effluent are the reasons behind the least preferred asp system since alternatives ranking is mostly reliant on weights of main criteria and minor variations in relative weights can result in significant changes in the final ranking thus sensitivity analysis was carried out corresponding to prioritisation of main criteria out of five considered scenarios major findings of sensitivity analysis shows that dosiwam is the most sustainable wwt system in addition collection and treatment of human waste for the production of renewable energy could be well coordinated with the most significant cleanliness campaign clean india mission by the government of india in the future this methodological framework could be extended by incorporating numerous local and global decision makers and collecting their inputs for additional decision making parameters to improve the effectiveness of the model further the same methodology could be applied for the selection of optimum treatment solution by including other finite available alternatives declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

13183,poly 3 4 ethylenedioxythiophene pedot had been explored as photosensitizer and hole transport agent however coating pedot on metal electrodes had issues with poor adhesion and delamination in this work the composite electrode with improved photo electrocatalytic performance was constructed by potentiostatic polymerization of pedot on graphite plate and subsequent loading of znin2s4 solid micro nanowires were observed in pure znin2s4 electrode which changed to polygon hollow tubular structure when loading znin2s4 on pedot surface from the hall effect results the resistance of composite electrode was reduced and the carriers density and mobility were increased the charge carrier mobility value was 173 15 cm 2 v 1 s 1 which was almost two and four times higher than pedot 85 90 cm 2 v 1 s 1 and znin2s4 42 90 cm 2 v 1 s 1 respectively the optimum edot concentration and polymerization time of pedot were 0 01 m and 20 min respectively the optimum scanning cycles for cyclic voltammetry deposition of zis and the ratio of zncl2 incl 4h2o and na2s2o3 5h2o were 400 cycles and 2 4 8 respectively the radical capture experiment showed that singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide radical o2 were produced by pedot anode while 1o2 o2 and hydroxyl radical oh were produced by the composite cathode through these reactive species the removal of tetracycline and methylene blue reached 91 and 99 after 180 min reaction respectively under external voltage of 0 9 v graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords photo electrocatalysis 3 4 ethylenedioxythiophene organic pollutants tetracycline removal mechanisms 1 introduction the treatment of organic pollutants usually involves adsorption 1 membrane separation 2 and advanced oxidation processes aops 3 the electrochemical oxidation 4 and nanomaterial photocatalysis 5 are promising aops for degradation of organic substances as a conductive polymer pedot has high conductivity and is suitable as a photo electrocatalytic material pedot has been successfully applied as photocatalyst with tunable morphology for pollutants elimination due to its narrow band gap and broad light absorption range 6 the pedot powder has been used as photocatalyst for efficient removal of metformin pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps 7 moreover based on its hole transport and photosensitivity pedot has been explored as dopant for the modification of other semiconductors such as g c3n4 8 tio2 9 ti pbo2 cr 10 and mwcnt 11 the fibers thin films and three dimensional bulks of pedot can be prepared through in situ polymerization 12 which involve in galvanostastic 13 potentiostatic 14 cyclic voltammetry 15 and vapor phase polymerization 16 the π conjugated polythienyl group in pedot can provide a channel for hole transport 17 when pedot was coupled with inorganic semiconductor materials 18 because of its higher charge injection ability and lower impedance than metals 19 the potentiostatic polymerization of pedot on carbon nanotubes and graphene can inhibit the recombination of charge carriers and increase photocurrent intensity and conductivity 20 znin2s4 zis is a well known n type semiconductor and suitable cathode material 21 however the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes limits its application constructing a z scheme heterojunction has been proven to be an effective strategy to improve the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts the z scheme photocatalyst can retain higher conduction band cb and lower valence band vb sites which can inhibit the recombination of electrons and holes 22 the z scheme system can not only generate electron hole pairs with high redox potentials but also promote the spatial separation of electrons and holes for improving photocatalytic efficiency 23 it was reported that z scheme photocatalyst can be obtained by coupling pedot and ag3po4 24 in this study the construction of z scheme heterojunction photocatalyst by coupling of zis and pedot would be a feasible method to improve the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in our previous research the photo generated electron hole recombination was reduced through in sequence deposition of zis and pedot on titanium substrate 21 however the coating of semiconductor zis between titanium substrate and pedot layer increased the entire resistivity and decreased carrier density in addition coating pedot on metal electrodes had issues with poor adhesion and delamination in this research the preparation of composite electrode on graphite plate is aimed at solving the problems of conductivity and adhesion metal free carbon materials have many advantages such as rich pore structure excellent acid and alkali resistance high temperature stability and low cost 25 it was proved that pedot can be stably polymerized on graphite substrate 26 in this research the composite electrode denoted as zis pedot was constructed by sequence loading of pedot and znin2s4 on graphite plate pedot was potentiostatically polymerized on graphite plate and served as hole injecting layer then zis was deposited by cyclic voltammetry on pedot and used to absorb solar energy for the generation of photocarriers the objectives of this research focused on the following three aspects firstly a simple and easy to control preparation method was optimized via coating high conductivity pedot on graphite substrate and then loading zis secondly the comprehensive characterization was carried out for in depth analysis of interaction mechanism between zis and pedot thirdly the photo electrocatalytic performance and mechanism were investigated and explored in dual electrodes system using pedot as anode and zis pedot composite electrode as cathode 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of electrodes the graphite plate with size of 20 mm 30 mm 2 mm width length thickness was used as substrate electrode the size of the catalyst loaded on the graphite plate was 20 mm 25 mm the graphite plate was polished with 1500 mesh sandpaper and pretreated with acetone isopropanol and deionized water in turn for 15 min by ultrasound specifically a certain volume of edot monomer was dissolved in 50 mm of anhydrous sodium sulfate electrolyte solution the polymerization reaction was carried out in the three electrode system including graphite plate ag agcl electrode and pt electrode as working electrode reference electrode and auxiliary electrode respectively before polymerization the solution was injected with high purity nitrogen for 15 min to remove dissolved oxygen the electrochemical polymerization was conducted in a potentiostatic mode at 0 9 v 27 after reaction the electrodes were rinsed with absolute ethanol and deionized water and then dried at 60 c during the preparation of pedot photoelectrode the optimal preparation conditions were obtained by controlling the concentration of edot precursor and charge or polymerization time the zis pedot electrode was prepared on the basis of the pedot electrode the prepared pedot electrode was used as the working electrode instead of pure graphite plate the electrochemical deposition of zis was conducted using cyclic voltammetry with the voltage range of 0 9 v 1 2 v 28 and the sweep rate of 0 1 v s 1 before the electrochemical deposition n2 was bubbled for 10 min to remove o2 in the solution and there was no agitation and aeration during the deposition after reaction the electrodes were rinsed with deionized water and then dried at 60 c the preparation of zis precursor solution was presented in detail

spectrometer uv2600a unico at 660 nm and 357 nm respectively the calibration curves of tc and mb were obtained and used for calculation in this study x y was applied to express reaction system where x and y represented cathode and anode respectively for example pedot pt pec denoted that the photo electrocatalytic experiment was performed using pedot as cathode and pt as anode the ph was adjusted by adding 1 m h2so4 and 1 m naoh droplets in order to test the electrode stability after the first run the cathode and anode were recovered by rinsing with deionized water several times the recycled two electrodes were placed in 200 ml fresh mb or tc solution for the second run in this way the experiments were repeated five times 2 3 characterization the surface morphology and cross section structure

tertiary butanol 29 2 mm tempol 2 mm and l histidine 30 2 mm were used to capture oh o2 and 1o2 respectively the process of the capture experiment was similar to the pec degradation of mb and tc except that capture agent was added to replace the pollutants nitroblue tetrazolium nbt 31 terephthalic acid and furfuryl alcohol were used as probe molecules to monitor the quantity of generated o2 oh and 1o2 respectively nbt terephthalic acid or furfuryl alcohol was added to the pec system instead of adding mb or tc terephthalic acid can react with oh to form 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid 32 the detection methods for nbt 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid and furfuryl alcohol 33 have been reported previously 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization as shown in fig 1a the diffraction peaks

1493 cm 1 were respectively related to the stretching of cβ cβ and the asymmetric stretching of cα cβ 34 this proved the successful polymerization of pedot in zis pedot the surface of the pure graphite plate was composed of micron level irregular flake structures fig 2a after pedot was polymerized on graphite plate the surface morphology exhibited irregular granules with particle size of 0 1 μm 0 5 μm fig 2b which was similar with previously observed morphology 21 the low magnification sem images for zis and zis pedot electrodes were shown in the supplementary information fig s1 some solid micro nanowires were observed from electrodeposited zis on the graphite plate the higher magnification sem image for zis sample in fig 2c showed an average diameter of 100 nm for those solid micro nanowires except these nanowires there were some zis particles existed the morphology was clearly changed when zis was combined with pedot showing a micron scale polygon hollow tubular structure fig 2d the pipe diameter was in the range of 0 1 μm 1 μm the first polymerization pedot particles on graphite plate might serve as template for the formation of polygon hollow tubular zis 35 a study reported that this hollow tubular structure could improve visible light absorption expose sufficient reactive sites and promote the separation and migration of photo generated charges 35 the cross section sem images of pedot and zis were shown in fig s2a and b it can be clearly seen that they were loaded on the graphite surface and also in the graphite pores because that precursor solution could penetrate into the porous structure of graphite plate the obvious delamination was not observed in the zis pedot composite sample fig s2c the polygon hollow tubular zis was randomly distributed on the pedot surface and some might utilize pedot particles as template for the tubular formation some tubular was embedded in the pedot particles so there was no obvious delamination and the contact between zis and pedot was tight which can maintain or improve the entire conductivity and carriers migration in addition the corresponding elemental composition of the cross section of zis pedot electrode fig 2e was shown in fig 2f the main feature elements zn in and s were detected in zis pedot electrode the detailed eds elemental mapping fig s3 exhibited the uniform distribution of zn in and s both xrd and eds analyses showed that znin2s4 was successfully synthesized via electrochemical method raman analysis indicated the successful polymerization of pedot the cv curves were observed in the tc and mb solutions as shown in fig 3a and b all cv curves have a rectangular like shape which showed the ideal electrochemical double layer capacitance performance of the electrode 36 the area under the cv curve of the zis pedot electrode increased which indicated that the capacitance value of the zis pedot was improved compared to that achieved by pedot or zis 37 zis pedot showed a stronger current response fig 3a and b this might be related to the minimum resistivity of the zis pedot electrode in addition the capacitance of the electrode material can be calculated using the cv curve 1 c s i s v vc v a i v dv v c v a s v where cs represents the capacitance f cm 2 s represents the total surface area of the electrode material cm2 the total polymer surface area is approximately 10 cm2 v represents the potential scan rate v s 1 i is the integral of the cv curve va and vc are the lowest and highest voltages mv respectively 38 the capacitances of zis pedot and zis pedot in tc solution were 67 06 mf cm 2 126 09 mf cm 2 and 194 12 mf cm 2 which were 84 17 mf cm 2 142 27 mf cm 2 and 301 38 mf cm 2 in mb solution respectively in the cases of both tc and mb solutions the capacitance value of zis pedot was approximately 3 0 times higher than that of zis and more than 1 5 times higher than that of pedot the increment in current density and capacitance of the zis pedot electrode was mainly due to its electrical conductivity moreover the hollow tubular structure of zis pedot may provide more surface active sites thereby improving charge transfer and double layer capacitance the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was shown in fig 3c which can be fitted as the equivalent circuit in fig 3d by zsimpwin software the eis diagram was composed of a semicircle in the high frequency region and a straight line in the low frequency region the equivalent circuit was composed of internal resistance rs interface charge transfer resistance rct electric double layer capacitance cdl warburg impedance w and pseudo capacitance c1 39 these parameters were shown in table s1 rs was the starting point of the semicircle in the high frequency region which reflected the ohmic contact between the graphite plate substrate and the pedot coating the rs of zis pedot was between pedot and zis indicating that the combination of pedot and zis can improve the entire conductivity lower rct diameter of the semicircle reflected lower charge transfer resistance and better electron hole separation and photocatalytic performance 40 the impedance radius of pedot was the smallest indicating that the charge transfer was easy to be achieved in pedot electrochemical system because of its low charge transfer resistance the maximum charge transfer resistance was observed in zis sample which was related to the semiconductor property the advantage of pedot was highlighted when combined with zis the charge transfer resistance of the resulting zis pedot composite was obviously decreased from 5 75 ω to 1 29 ω in comparison to zis this suggested that the electron hole separation in zis pedot was better than that of pure zis in addition the photoluminescence pl spectra can illustrate the separation of electron hole pairs due to the fluorescence emission by the recombination of free charge carriers and the weak pl intensity indicated low recombination 41 in fig 4a the pl peak intensity decreased in the order of zis zis pedot and pedot compared with zis the combination of pedot with zis reduced the recombination of electron hole pairs in zis pedot composite electrode and the obvious quenching of fluorescence was observed in fig 4a this result was in accordance with the result obtained in fig 3c the mott schottky diagram fig 4b can calculate the flat band potentials vfb by measuring the starting potential of the photocurrent through the following mott schottky equation 42 2 1 c 2 2 eξ ξ 0 n d a 2 v a v fb k b t e where c is the capacitance of the space charge layer e is the electronic charge e 1 60 10 19c ϵ is the dielectric constant ϵ 3 5 and ϵ0 is the dielectric constant of the vacuum ϵ0 8 85 10 12 f m 1 nd is the electron donor density a is the exposed area of the sample in the electrolyte a 1 00 10 3 m2 va is the applied potential vfb is the flat band potential kb is the boltzmann constant kb 1 38 10 23 j k 1 and t is room temperature t 298 k 42 the positive slope of the ms curve in fig 4b showed n type for all samples 43 vfb can be determined by using the intercept between the extrapolation of the straight tangent of the graph and the x axis it can be estimated from fig 4b that the flat band potentials of zis pedot and zis pedot were 1 30 v 1 56 v and 2 27 v versus ag agcl respectively by eq 3 the potential obtained from the ag agcl electrode can be converted into a relatively normal hydrogen electrode 44 3 e nhe e ag agcl e ag agcl 0 enhe is the conversion potential versus normal hydrogen electrode e0 ag agcl is 0 20 v at 25 c eag agcl is compared to the experimental measurement potential of ag agcl the flat band potentials of zis pedot and zis pedot were 1 10 v 1 36 v and 2 07 v versus nhe the potentials with respect to absolute vacuum scale avs given in electron volt unit ev can be obtained using eq 4 45 4 e nhe e avs 4 50 for n type semiconductors the conduction band value is very close to its flat band value 46 therefore the ecb of zis pedot and zis pedot were 3 40 ev 3 14 ev and 2 43 ev respectively based on the uv vis drs fig 4c spectrum the kubelka munk function fig 4d was used to estimate its optical energy gap 47 the intercept of photon energy axis can be obtained by extrapolating the straight line portion of the curve to the x axis which was estimated to be the band gap the band gaps of zis pedot and zis pedot were 4 15 ev 4 89 ev and 3 75 ev respectively the band gap of the zis pedot composite was reduced which may help to improve the photocatalytic activity the value band can be calculated by eq 5 48 5 e vb e cb e g by calculation the valence bands of zis pedot and zis pedot were 0 75 ev 1 75 ev and 1 32 ev respectively according to the obtained valence band conduction band and band gap the energy band structure diagrams of zis pedot and were shown in scheme 1 a and b it can be seen that the coupling of zis and pedot can construct z scheme heterojunction which was well consistent with the fluorescence spectra the pl peak intensity decreased in the order of zis zis pedot and pedot fig 4a which indicated that there was carrier recombination in zis pedot composite but this recombination was originated from the electrons in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo of pedot and the holes in the vb of zis in this way the electrons in the cb of zis with strong reducing ability can effectively participate in the reaction with o2 to produce reactive species which will be discussed in detail in later sections there were two important factors affecting the photo electrocatalytic efficiency one was the efficient separation of carriers and another was the amount of generated carriers in this experiment the embedding of polygon hollow tubular zis in the pedot particles made good contact between zis and pedot which was beneficial to the entire conductivity as shown in table 1 the resistivity of the zis pedot composite electrode was only 0 05 ω cm which was significantly decreased with respect to the 0 88 ω cm for zis and 0 14 ω cm for pedot the carrier surface density generated by the zis pedot electrode was 4 5 times and 1 5 times higher than that of zis and pedot respectively it was reported that conductive polymer photoelectrodes suffered from low carrier mobility 20 the typical charge carrier mobility values for poly 3 hexylthiophene 49 and pedot poly styrenesulfonate 50 were 0 01 0 1 cm2 v 1 s 1 and 0 05 1 7 cm2 v 1 s 1 respectively in this research the carrier mobility values for pedot were 85 89 cm2 v 1 s 1 in addition the carrier mobility of zis pedot composite was almost four and two times higher than that of zis and pedot respectively which further confirmed the results derived from eis and pl that zis pedot composite electrode promoted the separation and migration of carriers the hollow tubular structure of zis randomly distributed on the pedot surface or embedded in the pedot particles can promote the separation and migration of carriers 35 from table 1 zis pedot had the lowest resistivity and highest carrier surface density and volume density which could be helpful to improve photo electrocatalytic activity 3 2 photo electrocatalytic degradation performance the comparison of electro deposition zis by cyclic voltammetry and potentiostatic methods was shown in fig s4 the results showed that the preparation of zis by cyclic voltammetry electro deposition was better than potentiostatic method in addition the loading sequence of pedot and zis was also performed it can be seen that first potentiostatic polymerization of pedot on graphite plate and then cyclic voltammetry loading of zis exhibited better removal efficiency therefore the optimal condition can be obtained from fig s5 the edot concentration was 0 01 m and charge was 1 17 c corresponding polymerization time was 20 min the molar ratio of zis precursor solution zncl2 incl 4h2o na2s2o3 5h2o was selected as 2 4 8 the charge for cyclic voltammetry deposition of zis was 6 89 c corresponding 400 scanning cycles by using zis and zis pedot as cathode or pedot as anode the photo electrocatalytic degradation performances were respectively tested in the pt pedot zis pt and zis pedot pt system as shown in fig 5a and b the pec performance was improved in the order of pedot zis and zis pedot which was 62 67 and 71 for tc degradation and 57 70 and 77 for mb decoloration respectively the corresponding pseudo first order kinetics was fitted in fig 5c and d respectively and the results were summarized in supplementary materials table s2 the reaction rate constants for tc degradation increased in the order of 5 67 10 3 min 1 6 61 10 3 min 1 and 7 51 10 3 min 1 in pt pedot zis pt and zis pedot pt reaction system which were 4 55 10 3 min 1 6 56 10 3 min 1 and 8 24 10 3 min 1 respectively for mb degradation in the z scheme zis pedot heterojunction scheme 1a the weak oxidative holes in the vb of zis can recombine with electrons in the lumo of pedot hence the strong reductive electrons in cb of zis can be fully used for reactive species generation in addition more carriers were produced by zis pedot electrode therefore the pec performance in zis pedot pt reaction system was better than pt pedot and zis pt system moreover the pec degradation of tc and mb could reach 80 and 93 by replacing pt electrode with pedot as anode and their corresponding reaction rate constants were 9 27 10 3 min 1 and 1 54 10 2 min 1 in zis pedot pedot system this might be attributed to the fact that more reactive species were produced in zis pedot pedot reaction system which improved the utilization of zis pedot and pedot electrodes in addition the pc and ec efficiencies were comparatively studied in zis pedot pedot reaction system the pc and ec degradation efficiencies for tc were 48 and 8 respectively and 51 and 55 for mb it can be seen that the electrocatalytic degradation of tc was not obvious in zis pedot pedot reaction system which was even inferior to direct photolysis of tc however the 80 tc degradation efficiency by pec was higher than the total contribution of pc and ec this suggested that electro assisted photocatalytic can provide more energy for reactive species generation in addition the dark adsorption test showed that the removal rates of tc and mb by zis pedot pedot system were 1 6 and 8 0 respectively in the zis pedot pedot system the reaction conditions were optimized for the degradation of mb and tc fig 6 firstly the applied voltage was optimized in the range of 0 3 v 1 2 v the degradation of tc was very low when the applied potential was 0 3 v which was gradually improved by increasing potential to 0 6 v and 0 9 v however it was decreased when the potential was 1 2 v which was attributed that the peroxidation of pedot was occurred when the potential was over 1 2 v 51 the optimal reaction potential was selected as 0 9 v the similar result was obtained by degradation of mb under the external potential of 0 9 v the optimal reaction ph was explored when the ph was acidic ph 3 and weakly acidic ph 6 the degradation effect of tc was better which can reach 81 and 84 respectively the obvious inhibition effect was observed under alkaline conditions regarding the degradation of mb it seemed that the catalytic efficiency was not obviously affected by ph the reactive species were related to the aeration atmosphere in pec system the results fig 6 c f showed that the pec performance was better in o2 atmosphere than air aeration and was further superior to the n2 atmosphere which proved that the reactive oxygen species played leading role for both tc and mb removal in zis pedot pedot system the nitrogen atmosphere reduced the oxygen in the solution and could not produce reactive oxygen species which indirectly decreased the pec degradation efficiency for organic pollutants in oxygen atmosphere more reactive oxygen substances could be produced in addition the photo electrocatalytic stability for tc and mb degradation in zis pedot pedot system was shown in fig 7 the removal rates for tc during the five cycles were 90 91 92 85 and 85 respectively which were 99 99 98 98 and 98 for mb degradation it can be seen that the pec reaction system of zis pedot pedot was stable after five reactions the degradation effect did not change significantly in fig 8a the raman spectra of the used zis pedot electrode showed no change when compared with that of the unused zis pedot electrode in fig 8b the xrd of the zis pedot electrode material after five cycles showed zis diffraction peaks at 2θ 28 4 33 0 and 36 3 therefore it can be concluded that the zis pedot electrode material was relatively stable after five cycles the catalyst on its surface remained good and the crystal shape of the catalyst did not change 3 3 the determination of reactive species qualitative measurements were performed in zis pedot pt pt pedot and zis pedot pedot reaction system to explore the reactive species and the results were shown in figs s6 s7 and s8 the similar main reactive species were produced in the same pec reaction system for both tc and mb degradation this indicated that the generated reactive species were related to the reaction system and applied electrodes which were not related to the target pollutants in order to ascertain the mechanism in zis pedot pedot reaction system the reactive species produced by the zis pedot cathode and pt anode system zis pedot pt was shown in fig s6 the addition of tempol methanol and tertiary butanol significantly inhibited the progress of the reaction suggesting that reactive species o2 oh and so4 were identified however the reaction was promoted in the first 90 min and then inhibited in the subsequent 90 min when adding l histidine so the 1o2 cannot be determined by this trapping experiment and subsequent quantitative analysis was carried out next as shown in fig s7 the type of reactive species produced by the pedot anode and pt cathode system pt pedot was also studied the addition of tempol and l histidine significantly inhibited the progress of the reaction the addition of methanol and tertiary butanol was consistent with the results of no addition therefore the reactive species in pt pedot reaction system were o2 and 1o2 finally the reactive species produced in the zis pedot pedot reaction system were shown in fig s8 the results showed that the reactive species in the reaction system were preliminarily determined to be o2 1o2 oh and so4 this showed that using zis pedot as cathode and pedot as anode increased the electrode utilization and enhanced the generation of o2 and 1o2 on the one hand pedot served as photoanode can produce photo generated carriers under illumination some of photoelectrons can be captured by the surface chemisorbed o2 in order to produce o2 scheme 1b because that the estimated conduction band potential of pedot 1 36 v vs nhe was more negative than the e o2 o2 of 0 33 v vs nhe 52 some unreactive photogenerated electrons were introduced into the counter electrode through an external circuit on the other hand pedot served as photosensitizer can induce the generation of 1o2 through energy transfer for zis pedot cathode system scheme 1a the photoinduced electrons on the lumo of pedot recombined with holes on the vb of zis through z scheme heterojunction the electrons with strong oxidizing activity accumulated on the conduction band of zis therefore the generation of o2 and oh was much easier to be implemented by the reduction of o2 through photogenerated electrons and input electrons from external circuit in addition some so4 can be formed through the reactions among so4 2 with oh and electrons 21 the degradation of tc and mb can be performed through these reactive species as shown in scheme 1c it fully embodied the advantage of the zis pedot pedot reaction system the derived electrons from pedot anode can be fully used by zis pedot cathode which avoided the usage of pt counter electrode pedot anode and zis pedot cathode can be stimulated by visible light and improve the utilization of light energy moreover the same o2 reaction atmosphere was needed for both pedot anode and zis pedot cathode which avoided the partition of anode and cathode and simplified the reaction system the photo electrocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants was improved in this zis pedot pedot reaction system the amount of o2 fig 9a was calculated by the consumption of nbt fig 9b after 180 min of reaction the o2 produced by zis pedot pt pt pedot and zis pedot pedot were 1 50 10 2 mmol l 1 0 76 10 2 mmol l 1 and 1 84 10 2 mmol l 1 respectively both zis pedot pt and pt pedot produced less o2 than zis pedot pedot reaction system this was because the combination of pedot and zis can effectively inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes which can be proven by eis and pl results figs 3c and 4a moreover the zis pedot electrode had more negative conduction band which was helpful for the generation of o2 through electron reduction in addition using pedot as anode can enhance the generation of more o2 which fully improved the utilization rate of the electrode and effectively increased the production of o2 the production of 1o2 fig 9c can be calculated based on the consumption of furfuryl alcohol in fig 9d the accumulation of 1o2 after 180 min in pt pedot zis pedot pt and zis pedot pedot reaction system was 3 77 10 2 mmol l 1 3 45 10 2 mmol l 1 and 5 03 10 2 mmol l 1 respectively this was because that the pedot served as photosensitizer can excite the ground state oxygen to produce 1o2 26 finally the oh was quantitatively detected fig 9e owing to the generation of 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid fig 9f derived from the reaction of terephthalic acid and oh the oh produced by the zis pedot pt and zis pedot pedot electrodes were 10 61 10 2 mmol l 1 and 6 54 10 2 mmol l 1 respectively here the oh produced by zis pedot pt was higher than that of zis pedot pedot this might be attributed that some oh was consumed to produce so4 the main reactive species produced by the pt pedot system included o2 and 1o2 the main reactive species produced by zis pedot pt and zis pedot pedot included o2 oh and 1o2 coupling zis pedot and pedot as cathode and anode can increase the amount of produced o2 and 1o2 and improve its photo electrocatalytic performance in addition the polygon hollow tubular structure of zis embedded in the pedot particle layer can expose sufficient reactive sites for the reactive species reaction 35 4 conclusions in this study the photo electrocatalytic reaction system was constructed using zis pedot as photocathode and pedot as photoanode which showed excellent photo electrocatalytic activity and good stability for mb and tc degradation following main results were obtained 1 the micron scale polygon hollow tubular structure in zis pedot composite was beneficial to entire conductivity and migration of carriers 2 the lowest resistivity and highest carrier surface density and volume density were obtained by zis pedot composite electrode the conductivity of composite electrode was solved which was helpful in improving photo electrocatalytic activity 3 the generation of o2 and oh on zis pedot cathode was much easier to be implemented by the reduction of o2 through photogenerated electrons and input electrons of external circuit the zis pedot pedot system can make full use of the counter electrode to enhance the generation of o2 and 1o2 and improve photo electrocatalytic performance further declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

13183,poly 3 4 ethylenedioxythiophene pedot had been explored as photosensitizer and hole transport agent however coating pedot on metal electrodes had issues with poor adhesion and delamination in this work the composite electrode with improved photo electrocatalytic performance was constructed by potentiostatic polymerization of pedot on graphite plate and subsequent loading of znin2s4 solid micro nanowires were observed in pure znin2s4 electrode which changed to polygon hollow tubular structure when loading znin2s4 on pedot surface from the hall effect results the resistance of composite electrode was reduced and the carriers density and mobility were increased the charge carrier mobility value was 173 15 cm 2 v 1 s 1 which was almost two and four times higher than pedot 85 90 cm 2 v 1 s 1 and znin2s4 42 90 cm 2 v 1 s 1 respectively the optimum edot concentration and polymerization time of pedot were 0 01 m and 20 min respectively the optimum scanning cycles for cyclic voltammetry deposition of zis and the ratio of zncl2 incl 4h2o and na2s2o3 5h2o were 400 cycles and 2 4 8 respectively the radical capture experiment showed that singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide radical o2 were produced by pedot anode while 1o2 o2 and hydroxyl radical oh were produced by the composite cathode through these reactive species the removal of tetracycline and methylene blue reached 91 and 99 after 180 min reaction respectively under external voltage of 0 9 v graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords photo electrocatalysis 3 4 ethylenedioxythiophene organic pollutants tetracycline removal mechanisms 1 introduction the treatment of organic pollutants usually involves adsorption 1 membrane separation 2 and advanced oxidation processes aops 3 the electrochemical oxidation 4 and nanomaterial photocatalysis 5 are promising aops for degradation of organic substances as a conductive polymer pedot has high conductivity and is suitable as a photo electrocatalytic material pedot has been successfully applied as photocatalyst with tunable morphology for pollutants elimination due to its narrow band gap and broad light absorption range 6 the pedot powder has been used as photocatalyst for efficient removal of metformin pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps 7 moreover based on its hole transport and photosensitivity pedot has been explored as dopant for the modification of other semiconductors such as g c3n4 8 tio2 9 ti pbo2 cr 10 and mwcnt 11 the fibers thin films and three dimensional bulks of pedot can be prepared through in situ polymerization 12 which involve in galvanostastic 13 potentiostatic 14 cyclic voltammetry 15 and vapor phase polymerization 16 the π conjugated polythienyl group in pedot can provide a channel for hole transport 17 when pedot was coupled with inorganic semiconductor materials 18 because of its higher charge injection ability and lower impedance than metals 19 the potentiostatic polymerization of pedot on carbon nanotubes and graphene can inhibit the recombination of charge carriers and increase photocurrent intensity and conductivity 20 znin2s4 zis is a well known n type semiconductor and suitable cathode material 21 however the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes limits its application constructing a z scheme heterojunction has been proven to be an effective strategy to improve the photocatalytic performance of photocatalysts the z scheme photocatalyst can retain higher conduction band cb and lower valence band vb sites which can inhibit the recombination of electrons and holes 22 the z scheme system can not only generate electron hole pairs with high redox potentials but also promote the spatial separation of electrons and holes for improving photocatalytic efficiency 23 it was reported that z scheme photocatalyst can be obtained by coupling pedot and ag3po4 24 in this study the construction of z scheme heterojunction photocatalyst by coupling of zis and pedot would be a feasible method to improve the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in our previous research the photo generated electron hole recombination was reduced through in sequence deposition of zis and pedot on titanium substrate 21 however the coating of semiconductor zis between titanium substrate and pedot layer increased the entire resistivity and decreased carrier density in addition coating pedot on metal electrodes had issues with poor adhesion and delamination in this research the preparation of composite electrode on graphite plate is aimed at solving the problems of conductivity and adhesion metal free carbon materials have many advantages such as rich pore structure excellent acid and alkali resistance high temperature stability and low cost 25 it was proved that pedot can be stably polymerized on graphite substrate 26 in this research the composite electrode denoted as zis pedot was constructed by sequence loading of pedot and znin2s4 on graphite plate pedot was potentiostatically polymerized on graphite plate and served as hole injecting layer then zis was deposited by cyclic voltammetry on pedot and used to absorb solar energy for the generation of photocarriers the objectives of this research focused on the following three aspects firstly a simple and easy to control preparation method was optimized via coating high conductivity pedot on graphite substrate and then loading zis secondly the comprehensive characterization was carried out for in depth analysis of interaction mechanism between zis and pedot thirdly the photo electrocatalytic performance and mechanism were investigated and explored in dual electrodes system using pedot as anode and zis pedot composite electrode as cathode 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of electrodes the graphite plate with size of 20 mm 30 mm 2 mm width length thickness was used as substrate electrode the size of the catalyst loaded on the graphite plate was 20 mm 25 mm the graphite plate was polished with 1500 mesh sandpaper and pretreated with acetone isopropanol and deionized water in turn for 15 min by ultrasound specifically a certain volume of edot monomer was dissolved in 50 mm of anhydrous sodium sulfate electrolyte solution the polymerization reaction was carried out in the three electrode system including graphite plate ag agcl electrode and pt electrode as working electrode reference electrode and auxiliary electrode respectively before polymerization the solution was injected with high purity nitrogen for 15 min to remove dissolved oxygen the electrochemical polymerization was conducted in a potentiostatic mode at 0 9 v 27 after reaction the electrodes were rinsed with absolute ethanol and deionized water and then dried at 60 c during the preparation of pedot photoelectrode the optimal preparation conditions were obtained by controlling the concentration of edot precursor and charge or polymerization time the zis pedot electrode was prepared on the basis of the pedot electrode the prepared pedot electrode was used as the working electrode instead of pure graphite plate the electrochemical deposition of zis was conducted using cyclic voltammetry with the voltage range of 0 9 v 1 2 v 28 and the sweep rate of 0 1 v s 1 before the electrochemical deposition n2 was bubbled for 10 min to remove o2 in the solution and there was no agitation and aeration during the deposition after reaction the electrodes were rinsed with deionized water and then dried at 60 c the preparation of zis precursor solution was presented in detail in earlier study 21 the zis precursor solution concentration 28 and charge or deposition cycles were optimized the zis precursor solution was composed of zncl2 incl 4h2o and na2s2o3 5h2o their molar ratio of 1 mm 2 mm 4 mm 2 mm 4 mm 8 mm and 3 mm 6 mm 12 mm were investigated for comparison the pure zis electrode was prepared on graphite plate 2 2 photo electrocatalytic pec degradation experiments the electrode was immersed vertically in 200 ml methylene blue mb or tetracycline tc solution with an initial concentration of 5 mg l 1 the light source was 300 w xe lamp with light intensity of 180 mw cm 2 measured at a distance of 30 cm the whole experiment was carried out at room temperature 25 c 5 c with an aeration rate of 400 ml min 1 the removal rate of mb and tc was measured by uv vis spectrometer uv2600a unico at 660 nm and 357 nm respectively the calibration curves of tc and mb were obtained and used for calculation in this study x y was applied to express reaction system where x and y represented cathode and anode respectively for example pedot pt pec denoted that the photo electrocatalytic experiment was performed using pedot as cathode and pt as anode the ph was adjusted by adding 1 m h2so4 and 1 m naoh droplets in order to test the electrode stability after the first run the cathode and anode were recovered by rinsing with deionized water several times the recycled two electrodes were placed in 200 ml fresh mb or tc solution for the second run in this way the experiments were repeated five times 2 3 characterization the surface morphology and cross section structure of the zis pedot and zis pedot electrodes were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem gemini sem 300 the elemental analysis of the zis pedot cross section was carried out by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds bruker xflash 6130 the crystal structure was observed by x ray diffractometer xrd smartlab9k the raman spectrum was obtained by a laser micro confocal raman spectrometer symefel dxr 2xi the photoluminescence spectrum pl was measured using an excitation wavelength of 514 nm edinberghflsp920 the hall effect was tested using the hall effect tester lakeshore 7707 uv visible spectrum was obtained by japan shimadzu uv 3600 plus test all the electrochemical characterizations were conducted in the three electrode system with ag agcl as reference electrode pt electrode as auxiliary electrode and the tested electrode as working electrode cyclic voltammetry cv was tested in 5 mg l 1 tc or mb solution supplemented with 50 mm na2so4 as the supporting electrolyte with scanning speed of 0 01 v s 1 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was tested at a frequency of 1 105 hz in 50 mm na2so4 electrolyte solution the impedance potential parameter model was used to test mott schottky ms in 50 mm na2so4 electrolyte solution the ac amplitude and frequency were respectively selected as 5 mv and 1000 hz 2 4 reactive species analysis methanol tertiary butanol tempol and l histidine were added to the solution as quenchers for assessing contribution of reactive species in degradation process methanol 29 500 mm was used to trap oh and so4 tertiary butanol 29 2 mm tempol 2 mm and l histidine 30 2 mm were used to capture oh o2 and 1o2 respectively the process of the capture experiment was similar to the pec degradation of mb and tc except that capture agent was added to replace the pollutants nitroblue tetrazolium nbt 31 terephthalic acid and furfuryl alcohol were used as probe molecules to monitor the quantity of generated o2 oh and 1o2 respectively nbt terephthalic acid or furfuryl alcohol was added to the pec system instead of adding mb or tc terephthalic acid can react with oh to form 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid 32 the detection methods for nbt 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid and furfuryl alcohol 33 have been reported previously 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization as shown in fig 1a the diffraction peaks located at 2θ 26 5 42 3 44 5 54 6 77 5 and 83 6 can be indexed to graphite standard card pdf 89 8487 in 002 100 101 004 110 and 112 the diffraction peaks at 2θ 28 4 33 0 and 36 3 in the xrd patterns of the prepared zis and zis pedot can be indexed to znin2s4 in 104 018 and 1010 standard card pdf 72 0304 fig 1b showed the raman spectra of zis pedot and zis pedot the bands at 436 575 and 989 cm 1 can be indexed to the deformation of the oxyethylene oxide ring 34 the bands at 699 and 1124 cm 1 were related to the deformation of symmetric c s c 20 and c o c 34 respectively the bands at 1367 and 1493 cm 1 were respectively related to the stretching of cβ cβ and the asymmetric stretching of cα cβ 34 this proved the successful polymerization of pedot in zis pedot the surface of the pure graphite plate was composed of micron level irregular flake structures fig 2a after pedot was polymerized on graphite plate the surface morphology exhibited irregular granules with particle size of 0 1 μm 0 5 μm fig 2b which was similar with previously observed morphology 21 the low magnification sem images for zis and zis pedot electrodes were shown in the supplementary information fig s1 some solid micro nanowires were observed from electrodeposited zis on the graphite plate the higher magnification sem image for zis sample in fig 2c showed an average diameter of 100 nm for those solid micro nanowires except these nanowires there were some zis particles existed the morphology was clearly changed when zis was combined with pedot showing a micron scale polygon hollow tubular structure fig 2d the pipe diameter was in the range of 0 1 μm 1 μm the first polymerization pedot particles on graphite plate might serve as template for the formation of polygon hollow tubular zis 35 a study reported that this hollow tubular structure could improve visible light absorption expose sufficient reactive sites and promote the separation and migration of photo generated charges 35 the cross section sem images of pedot and zis were shown in fig s2a and b it can be clearly seen that they were loaded on the graphite surface and also in the graphite pores because that precursor solution could penetrate into the porous structure of graphite plate the obvious delamination was not observed in the zis pedot composite sample fig s2c the polygon hollow tubular zis was randomly distributed on the pedot surface and some might utilize pedot particles as template for the tubular formation some tubular was embedded in the pedot particles so there was no obvious delamination and the contact between zis and pedot was tight which can maintain or improve the entire conductivity and carriers migration in addition the corresponding elemental composition of the cross section of zis pedot electrode fig 2e was shown in fig 2f the main feature elements zn in and s were detected in zis pedot electrode the detailed eds elemental mapping fig s3 exhibited the uniform distribution of zn in and s both xrd and eds analyses showed that znin2s4 was successfully synthesized via electrochemical method raman analysis indicated the successful polymerization of pedot the cv curves were observed in the tc and mb solutions as shown in fig 3a and b all cv curves have a rectangular like shape which showed the ideal electrochemical double layer capacitance performance of the electrode 36 the area under the cv curve of the zis pedot electrode increased which indicated that the capacitance value of the zis pedot was improved compared to that achieved by pedot or zis 37 zis pedot showed a stronger current response fig 3a and b this might be related to the minimum resistivity of the zis pedot electrode in addition the capacitance of the electrode material can be calculated using the cv curve 1 c s i s v vc v a i v dv v c v a s v where cs represents the capacitance f cm 2 s represents the total surface area of the electrode material cm2 the total polymer surface area is approximately 10 cm2 v represents the potential scan rate v s 1 i is the integral of the cv curve va and vc are the lowest and highest voltages mv respectively 38 the capacitances of zis pedot and zis pedot in tc solution were 67 06 mf cm 2 126 09 mf cm 2 and 194 12 mf cm 2 which were 84 17 mf cm 2 142 27 mf cm 2 and 301 38 mf cm 2 in mb solution respectively in the cases of both tc and mb solutions the capacitance value of zis pedot was approximately 3 0 times higher than that of zis and more than 1 5 times higher than that of pedot the increment in current density and capacitance of the zis pedot electrode was mainly due to its electrical conductivity moreover the hollow tubular structure of zis pedot may provide more surface active sites thereby improving charge transfer and double layer capacitance the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was shown in fig 3c which can be fitted as the equivalent circuit in fig 3d by zsimpwin software the eis diagram was composed of a semicircle in the high frequency region and a straight line in the low frequency region the equivalent circuit was composed of internal resistance rs interface charge transfer resistance rct electric double layer capacitance cdl warburg impedance w and pseudo capacitance c1 39 these parameters were shown in table s1 rs was the starting point of the semicircle in the high frequency region which reflected the ohmic contact between the graphite plate substrate and the pedot coating the rs of zis pedot was between pedot and zis indicating that the combination of pedot and zis can improve the entire conductivity lower rct diameter of the semicircle reflected lower charge transfer resistance and better electron hole separation and photocatalytic performance 40 the impedance radius of pedot was the smallest indicating that the charge transfer was easy to be achieved in pedot electrochemical system because of its low charge transfer resistance the maximum charge transfer resistance was observed in zis sample which was related to the semiconductor property the advantage of pedot was highlighted when combined with zis the charge transfer resistance of the resulting zis pedot composite was obviously decreased from 5 75 ω to 1 29 ω in comparison to zis this suggested that the electron hole separation in zis pedot was better than that of pure zis in addition the photoluminescence pl spectra can illustrate the separation of electron hole pairs due to the fluorescence emission by the recombination of free charge carriers and the weak pl intensity indicated low recombination 41 in fig 4a the pl peak intensity decreased in the order of zis zis pedot and pedot compared with zis the combination of pedot with zis reduced the recombination of electron hole pairs in zis pedot composite electrode and the obvious quenching of fluorescence was observed in fig 4a this result was in accordance with the result obtained in fig 3c the mott schottky diagram fig 4b can calculate the flat band potentials vfb by measuring the starting potential of the photocurrent through the following mott schottky equation 42 2 1 c 2 2 eξ ξ 0 n d a 2 v a v fb k b t e where c is the capacitance of the space charge layer e is the electronic charge e 1 60 10 19c ϵ is the dielectric constant ϵ 3 5 and ϵ0 is the dielectric constant of the vacuum ϵ0 8 85 10 12 f m 1 nd is the electron donor density a is the exposed area of the sample in the electrolyte a 1 00 10 3 m2 va is the applied potential vfb is the flat band potential kb is the boltzmann constant kb 1 38 10 23 j k 1 and t is room temperature t 298 k 42 the positive slope of the ms curve in fig 4b showed n type for all samples 43 vfb can be determined by using the intercept between the extrapolation of the straight tangent of the graph and the x axis it can be estimated from fig 4b that the flat band potentials of zis pedot and zis pedot were 1 30 v 1 56 v and 2 27 v versus ag agcl respectively by eq 3 the potential obtained from the ag agcl electrode can be converted into a relatively normal hydrogen electrode 44 3 e nhe e ag agcl e ag agcl 0 enhe is the conversion potential versus normal hydrogen electrode e0 ag agcl is 0 20 v at 25 c eag agcl is compared to the experimental measurement potential of ag agcl the flat band potentials of zis pedot and zis pedot were 1 10 v 1 36 v and 2 07 v versus nhe the potentials with respect to absolute vacuum scale avs given in electron volt unit ev can be obtained using eq 4 45 4 e nhe e avs 4 50 for n type semiconductors the conduction band value is very close to its flat band value 46 therefore the ecb of zis pedot and zis pedot were 3 40 ev 3 14 ev and 2 43 ev respectively based on the uv vis drs fig 4c spectrum the kubelka munk function fig 4d was used to estimate its optical energy gap 47 the intercept of photon energy axis can be obtained by extrapolating the straight line portion of the curve to the x axis which was estimated to be the band gap the band gaps of zis pedot and zis pedot were 4 15 ev 4 89 ev and 3 75 ev respectively the band gap of the zis pedot composite was reduced which may help to improve the photocatalytic activity the value band can be calculated by eq 5 48 5 e vb e cb e g by calculation the valence bands of zis pedot and zis pedot were 0 75 ev 1 75 ev and 1 32 ev respectively according to the obtained valence band conduction band and band gap the energy band structure diagrams of zis pedot and were shown in scheme 1 a and b it can be seen that the coupling of zis and pedot can construct z scheme heterojunction which was well consistent with the fluorescence spectra the pl peak intensity decreased in the order of zis zis pedot and pedot fig 4a which indicated that there was carrier recombination in zis pedot composite but this recombination was originated from the electrons in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo of pedot and the holes in the vb of zis in this way the electrons in the cb of zis with strong reducing ability can effectively participate in the reaction with o2 to produce reactive species which will be discussed in detail in later sections there were two important factors affecting the photo electrocatalytic efficiency one was the efficient separation of carriers and another was the amount of generated carriers in this experiment the embedding of polygon hollow tubular zis in the pedot particles made good contact between zis and pedot which was beneficial to the entire conductivity as shown in table 1 the resistivity of the zis pedot composite electrode was only 0 05 ω cm which was significantly decreased with respect to the 0 88 ω cm for zis and 0 14 ω cm for pedot the carrier surface density generated by the zis pedot electrode was 4 5 times and 1 5 times higher than that of zis and pedot respectively it was reported that conductive polymer photoelectrodes suffered from low carrier mobility 20 the typical charge carrier mobility values for poly 3 hexylthiophene 49 and pedot poly styrenesulfonate 50 were 0 01 0 1 cm2 v 1 s 1 and 0 05 1 7 cm2 v 1 s 1 respectively in this research the carrier mobility values for pedot were 85 89 cm2 v 1 s 1 in addition the carrier mobility of zis pedot composite was almost four and two times higher than that of zis and pedot respectively which further confirmed the results derived from eis and pl that zis pedot composite electrode promoted the separation and migration of carriers the hollow tubular structure of zis randomly distributed on the pedot surface or embedded in the pedot particles can promote the separation and migration of carriers 35 from table 1 zis pedot had the lowest resistivity and highest carrier surface density and volume density which could be helpful to improve photo electrocatalytic activity 3 2 photo electrocatalytic degradation performance the comparison of electro deposition zis by cyclic voltammetry and potentiostatic methods was shown in fig s4 the results showed that the preparation of zis by cyclic voltammetry electro deposition was better than potentiostatic method in addition the loading sequence of pedot and zis was also performed it can be seen that first potentiostatic polymerization of pedot on graphite plate and then cyclic voltammetry loading of zis exhibited better removal efficiency therefore the optimal condition can be obtained from fig s5 the edot concentration was 0 01 m and charge was 1 17 c corresponding polymerization time was 20 min the molar ratio of zis precursor solution zncl2 incl 4h2o na2s2o3 5h2o was selected as 2 4 8 the charge for cyclic voltammetry deposition of zis was 6 89 c corresponding 400 scanning cycles by using zis and zis pedot as cathode or pedot as anode the photo electrocatalytic degradation performances were respectively tested in the pt pedot zis pt and zis pedot pt system as shown in fig 5a and b the pec performance was improved in the order of pedot zis and zis pedot which was 62 67 and 71 for tc degradation and 57 70 and 77 for mb decoloration respectively the corresponding pseudo first order kinetics was fitted in fig 5c and d respectively and the results were summarized in supplementary materials table s2 the reaction rate constants for tc degradation increased in the order of 5 67 10 3 min 1 6 61 10 3 min 1 and 7 51 10 3 min 1 in pt pedot zis pt and zis pedot pt reaction system which were 4 55 10 3 min 1 6 56 10 3 min 1 and 8 24 10 3 min 1 respectively for mb degradation in the z scheme zis pedot heterojunction scheme 1a the weak oxidative holes in the vb of zis can recombine with electrons in the lumo of pedot hence the strong reductive electrons in cb of zis can be fully used for reactive species generation in addition more carriers were produced by zis pedot electrode therefore the pec performance in zis pedot pt reaction system was better than pt pedot and zis pt system moreover the pec degradation of tc and mb could reach 80 and 93 by replacing pt electrode with pedot as anode and their corresponding reaction rate constants were 9 27 10 3 min 1 and 1 54 10 2 min 1 in zis pedot pedot system this might be attributed to the fact that more reactive species were produced in zis pedot pedot reaction system which improved the utilization of zis pedot and pedot electrodes in addition the pc and ec efficiencies were comparatively studied in zis pedot pedot reaction system the pc and ec degradation efficiencies for tc were 48 and 8 respectively and 51 and 55 for mb it can be seen that the electrocatalytic degradation of tc was not obvious in zis pedot pedot reaction system which was even inferior to direct photolysis of tc however the 80 tc degradation efficiency by pec was higher than the total contribution of pc and ec this suggested that electro assisted photocatalytic can provide more energy for reactive species generation in addition the dark adsorption test showed that the removal rates of tc and mb by zis pedot pedot system were 1 6 and 8 0 respectively in the zis pedot pedot system the reaction conditions were optimized for the degradation of mb and tc fig 6 firstly the applied voltage was optimized in the range of 0 3 v 1 2 v the degradation of tc was very low when the applied potential was 0 3 v which was gradually improved by increasing potential to 0 6 v and 0 9 v however it was decreased when the potential was 1 2 v which was attributed that the peroxidation of pedot was occurred when the potential was over 1 2 v 51 the optimal reaction potential was selected as 0 9 v the similar result was obtained by degradation of mb under the external potential of 0 9 v the optimal reaction ph was explored when the ph was acidic ph 3 and weakly acidic ph 6 the degradation effect of tc was better which can reach 81 and 84 respectively the obvious inhibition effect was observed under alkaline conditions regarding the degradation of mb it seemed that the catalytic efficiency was not obviously affected by ph the reactive species were related to the aeration atmosphere in pec system the results fig 6 c f showed that the pec performance was better in o2 atmosphere than air aeration and was further superior to the n2 atmosphere which proved that the reactive oxygen species played leading role for both tc and mb removal in zis pedot pedot system the nitrogen atmosphere reduced the oxygen in the solution and could not produce reactive oxygen species which indirectly decreased the pec degradation efficiency for organic pollutants in oxygen atmosphere more reactive oxygen substances could be produced in addition the photo electrocatalytic stability for tc and mb degradation in zis pedot pedot system was shown in fig 7 the removal rates for tc during the five cycles were 90 91 92 85 and 85 respectively which were 99 99 98 98 and 98 for mb degradation it can be seen that the pec reaction system of zis pedot pedot was stable after five reactions the degradation effect did not change significantly in fig 8a the raman spectra of the used zis pedot electrode showed no change when compared with that of the unused zis pedot electrode in fig 8b the xrd of the zis pedot electrode material after five cycles showed zis diffraction peaks at 2θ 28 4 33 0 and 36 3 therefore it can be concluded that the zis pedot electrode material was relatively stable after five cycles the catalyst on its surface remained good and the crystal shape of the catalyst did not change 3 3 the determination of reactive species qualitative measurements were performed in zis pedot pt pt pedot and zis pedot pedot reaction system to explore the reactive species and the results were shown in figs s6 s7 and s8 the similar main reactive species were produced in the same pec reaction system for both tc and mb degradation this indicated that the generated reactive species were related to the reaction system and applied electrodes which were not related to the target pollutants in order to ascertain the mechanism in zis pedot pedot reaction system the reactive species produced by the zis pedot cathode and pt anode system zis pedot pt was shown in fig s6 the addition of tempol methanol and tertiary butanol significantly inhibited the progress of the reaction suggesting that reactive species o2 oh and so4 were identified however the reaction was promoted in the first 90 min and then inhibited in the subsequent 90 min when adding l histidine so the 1o2 cannot be determined by this trapping experiment and subsequent quantitative analysis was carried out next as shown in fig s7 the type of reactive species produced by the pedot anode and pt cathode system pt pedot was also studied the addition of tempol and l histidine significantly inhibited the progress of the reaction the addition of methanol and tertiary butanol was consistent with the results of no addition therefore the reactive species in pt pedot reaction system were o2 and 1o2 finally the reactive species produced in the zis pedot pedot reaction system were shown in fig s8 the results showed that the reactive species in the reaction system were preliminarily determined to be o2 1o2 oh and so4 this showed that using zis pedot as cathode and pedot as anode increased the electrode utilization and enhanced the generation of o2 and 1o2 on the one hand pedot served as photoanode can produce photo generated carriers under illumination some of photoelectrons can be captured by the surface chemisorbed o2 in order to produce o2 scheme 1b because that the estimated conduction band potential of pedot 1 36 v vs nhe was more negative than the e o2 o2 of 0 33 v vs nhe 52 some unreactive photogenerated electrons were introduced into the counter electrode through an external circuit on the other hand pedot served as photosensitizer can induce the generation of 1o2 through energy transfer for zis pedot cathode system scheme 1a the photoinduced electrons on the lumo of pedot recombined with holes on the vb of zis through z scheme heterojunction the electrons with strong oxidizing activity accumulated on the conduction band of zis therefore the generation of o2 and oh was much easier to be implemented by the reduction of o2 through photogenerated electrons and input electrons from external circuit in addition some so4 can be formed through the reactions among so4 2 with oh and electrons 21 the degradation of tc and mb can be performed through these reactive species as shown in scheme 1c it fully embodied the advantage of the zis pedot pedot reaction system the derived electrons from pedot anode can be fully used by zis pedot cathode which avoided the usage of pt counter electrode pedot anode and zis pedot cathode can be stimulated by visible light and improve the utilization of light energy moreover the same o2 reaction atmosphere was needed for both pedot anode and zis pedot cathode which avoided the partition of anode and cathode and simplified the reaction system the photo electrocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants was improved in this zis pedot pedot reaction system the amount of o2 fig 9a was calculated by the consumption of nbt fig 9b after 180 min of reaction the o2 produced by zis pedot pt pt pedot and zis pedot pedot were 1 50 10 2 mmol l 1 0 76 10 2 mmol l 1 and 1 84 10 2 mmol l 1 respectively both zis pedot pt and pt pedot produced less o2 than zis pedot pedot reaction system this was because the combination of pedot and zis can effectively inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes which can be proven by eis and pl results figs 3c and 4a moreover the zis pedot electrode had more negative conduction band which was helpful for the generation of o2 through electron reduction in addition using pedot as anode can enhance the generation of more o2 which fully improved the utilization rate of the electrode and effectively increased the production of o2 the production of 1o2 fig 9c can be calculated based on the consumption of furfuryl alcohol in fig 9d the accumulation of 1o2 after 180 min in pt pedot zis pedot pt and zis pedot pedot reaction system was 3 77 10 2 mmol l 1 3 45 10 2 mmol l 1 and 5 03 10 2 mmol l 1 respectively this was because that the pedot served as photosensitizer can excite the ground state oxygen to produce 1o2 26 finally the oh was quantitatively detected fig 9e owing to the generation of 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid fig 9f derived from the reaction of terephthalic acid and oh the oh produced by the zis pedot pt and zis pedot pedot electrodes were 10 61 10 2 mmol l 1 and 6 54 10 2 mmol l 1 respectively here the oh produced by zis pedot pt was higher than that of zis pedot pedot this might be attributed that some oh was consumed to produce so4 the main reactive species produced by the pt pedot system included o2 and 1o2 the main reactive species produced by zis pedot pt and zis pedot pedot included o2 oh and 1o2 coupling zis pedot and pedot as cathode and anode can increase the amount of produced o2 and 1o2 and improve its photo electrocatalytic performance in addition the polygon hollow tubular structure of zis embedded in the pedot particle layer can expose sufficient reactive sites for the reactive species reaction 35 4 conclusions in this study the photo electrocatalytic reaction system was constructed using zis pedot as photocathode and pedot as photoanode which showed excellent photo electrocatalytic activity and good stability for mb and tc degradation following main results were obtained 1 the micron scale polygon hollow tubular structure in zis pedot composite was beneficial to entire conductivity and migration of carriers 2 the lowest resistivity and highest carrier surface density and volume density were obtained by zis pedot composite electrode the conductivity of composite electrode was solved which was helpful in improving photo electrocatalytic activity 3 the generation of o2 and oh on zis pedot cathode was much easier to be implemented by the reduction of o2 through photogenerated electrons and input electrons of external circuit the zis pedot pedot system can make full use of the counter electrode to enhance the generation of o2 and 1o2 and improve photo electrocatalytic performance further declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

contaminants 1 3 the partly treated industrial effluents contain dyes phenols antibiotics and heavy metals which are pollutes the water bodies and make harmful to the aquatics and human beings 4 6 commonly tio2 is used to treat water pollutants due to its non toxicity stability and high efficiency in presence of uv light 7 the applications of tio2 based materials are limited because of higher rate of electron hole recombination low quantum efficiency and band gap mismatch with sunlight 8 10 therefore fabrication of novel low cost and efficient visible photon driven semiconductor photocatalyst seeks more attention among the researchers 11 12 metal sulphides proved as a most competent semiconductor photocatalyst among the various semiconductors for the photochemical conversions indium sulfide in2s3 is a visible light responsive n type semiconductor photocatalyst with promising optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications 13 14 in2s3 nanomaterial have superior photocatalytic

15 cheng et al found that hollow in2s3 cdin2s4 composite photocatalyst could be formed by hydrothermal method and followed ultrasound sonication which possess the superior photocatalytic cr vi reduction 16 for instance yang et al reported that ca ii doped β in2s3 showed higher photocatalytic hydrogen generation and organic dye degradation under visible light irradiation 17 chen et al fabricated porous tubular in2s3 in2o3 for efficient photocatalytic h2o2 production in pure water system 18 though it has all superior characteristics for photocatalytic activity it suffers mainly with rapid recombination of the photogenerated electron hole pairs this decreases its quantum and photo catalytic efficiency to enhance the photocatalytic activity of indium sulphide it may combine with electron acceptors such as doped with noble metals and carbon materials or constructing in2s3 based heterostructures 19 20 neodymium oxide nd2o3 is a p type semiconductor with wide range of applications due to its unique optical behaviour such as photonic application luminescent and thermo luminescent materials 21 22 ajabshir et al synthesized nd2o3 via a simple precipitation method and

juvenile rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis 24 25 now a days ssz is frequently found in the various environments such as surface and ground water bodies ssz in the aquatic environment affect the ecosystem and make a severe risk to human life by food chain it is essential to remove ssz from the aquatics to diminish the harmful impacts of ssz to human being and the ecosystem 26 heavy metal ion hexavalent chromium cr vi is one of the major hazardous industrial pollutants which enters from electroplating leather tanning paint and pigment and textile dyeing industries cr iv is more toxic and carcinogenic than cr iii due to its high mobility high stability hard to reduce and effective toxicity it acts as great to ecosystem and human being 27 28 concentration of cr vi in drinking water exceeds 0 1 mg l it create fetal malformation and cancer in the oral cavity and small intestine cr vi also causes a lot of health issues such as lung malignancies chronic inhalation pain and toxicity in the liver 29 30 toxicity of cr vi decreases by convert to into cr iii and cr iii act as the micronutrient for human being therefore its necessary to reduce and takeout cr vi from the ecosystem to safeguard the human lives and aquatics 31 in this present study we successfully designed a novel n in2s3 p nd2o3 heterojunction photocatalyst by

diffraction patterns of pure in2s3 agreement with the jcpds card no 65 0459 19 this shows that in2s3 were face centre cubic phase with major diffraction peaks 111 222 400 and 440 at 2θ values 14 57 27 25 32 82 and 47 45 respectively the lattice parameter was found to be a 10 77 å with a cell volume of 1250 64 å the diffraction patterns of pure nd2o3 have a good agreement with the jcpds card no 74 2139 33 the pure nd2o3 have primitive hexagonal phase with the strong diffraction pattern at 2θ values 30 22 26 35 and 46 92 with the diffraction patterns 011 100 and 110 respectively the lattice parameter of unit cell found to be a 3 831 å and c 5 999 å with a cell volume of 76 25 å as for the in2s3 nd2o3 heterostructures all the diffraction patterns of in2s3 were observed in all the three samples and the peak intensity of nd2o3 increases gradually with the increase of the loading especially the intensities of crystal planes 110 and 012 increases from in2s3 5 wt nd2o3 to in2s3 15 wt nd2o3 therefore it could be concluded that the in2s3 nd2o3 nanomaterials were successfully synthesized by ultra sonication method existence of sharp and intense peaks indicates their high crystalline nature therefore various structural parameters were calculated from the xrd pattern average crystalline size d dislocation density δ micro strain ε and stacking fault were calculated from the formula 1 4 and tabulated in table s1 1 crystalline size d 0 94 λ β cos θ 2 dislocation density δ 1 d 2 3 micro strain ε β cos θ 4 4 stacking fault 2 π 2 45 tanθ 1 2 β the value of crystalline parameter decreases it becomes highly crystalline the values of table s1 shows that all the prepared samples are highly crystalline especially among the three different ratios of in2s3 nd2o3 and in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 was highly crystalline in order to study the chemical states and surface chemical composition of the nd2o3 and in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposite the xps analysis was carried out fig 2 all the chemical elements such as in s nd and o characteristic peaks were calibrated by carbon c1s peak 284 6 ev caused by stray carbon fig 2a the nd3d fig 2b was divided into two peaks at 981 1 and 1004 1 ev assigned to the nd 3d5 2 and nd 3d3 2 orbital spin splitting of nd 3d with an energy difference of 23 0 ev the small shoulder peak at 977 5 ev correspond to the transfer of electron from the oxygen to nd 4f3 orbital 34 compared to pure nd2o3 the binding energies of nd 3d5 2 and nd 3d3 2 dramatically shifted and decreased in that of the in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposite 35 the o1s spectrum fig 2c shows the characteristic peak at 530 4 ev which was owing to the lattice oxygen ions in the nd2o3 crystal lattice and there was also a small peak at 527 7 ev ascribed to non lattice oxygen ions 36 in addition the intensity of o1s in the in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposite was dropped compared to bare nd2o3 and an appeared new peak at 532 4 ev could also be assigned to surface adsorbed oh from the air atmosphere the xps spectra of in3d fig 2d can be deconvoluted into four peaks at 443 3 445 9 450 7 and 453 3 ev the two high intensity binding energy at 443 3 and 450 7 ev are attributed to in 3d5 2 and in 3d3 2 respectively indicating that in3 oxidation state of in2s3 another weak satellite peaks at 445 9 and 453 3 ev corresponds to the in oh 3 phase 37 the s2p spectrum can be deconstructed into three peaks located at 159 7 160 9 and 163 1 ev were related to the s 2p3 2 s 2p1 2 and sulfate groups c so2 associated to s6 as shown in fig 2e 38 3 2 morphological and surface area analysis texture and morphology of the as synthesized in2s3 and in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposite were investigated by sem analysis and depicted in fig 3 from fig 3a clearly indicates that in2s3 has the morphology of nano flakes assembled flowers like structure the inset of fig 3a shows the enlarged image of in2s3 39 40 fig 3b shows the sem image of nd2o3 which has nanosponge like morphology fig 3c clearly picturise that the nd2o3 nonosponges are embedded on the surface of in2s3 nanoflowers and illustrate the in2s3 nd2o3 heterostructure formation fig s2 shows the edax spectrum of pure in2s3 nd2o3 and the in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite edax spectrum exposes the purity and composition of the synthesized nanomaterial the fig s2 clearly indicates that the presence of indium in and sulphur s in in2s3 neodymium nd and oxygen o in nd2o3 and existence of in nd s and o in in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite without any impurities the elemental mapping of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite is given in fig s3 it reveals the fragmentation of elements in nd s and o by the colors of blue yellow green and red for the given sem image the detailed invetigation about the morphology and micro structural information of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 was examined by tem and hrtem fig 4 the fig 4a and b picturizes tem images of in2s3 and in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 tem image confirmed that the nd2o3 nanosponges were covered by in2s3 nano wrinkles and coincide with the sem images the lattice fringes of in2s3 and in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposite are dipicted in fig 4c d inset the lattice spacing 0 38 nm matched with the planes 220 of cubic phase in2s3 and the fringes of the lattice 0 29 nm matches with the plane 011 of nd2o3 fig 4e f gives the selected area electron diffraction saed pattern of the pure in2s3 and in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposite which reveals that the high crystalline nature of the structures and consistent with xrd analysis surface area and pore sizes of the pure nd2o3 and the in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite was accessed by using brunauer emmett teller bet analysis and their corresponding pore size distribution plots are displayed in fig 5 the n2 adsorption and desorption isotherms for nd2o3 and the in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 which represent typical type iv physisorption with a h3 hysteresis loop in the iupac classification it could be seen that surface area of nd2o3 and the in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite was 34 57 and 33 92 m2 g respectively from the fig 5 inset the mean pore diameter nd2o3 and the in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 was found to be 2 21 and 9 49 nm which corresponds to the pore volume of 0 072 and 0 195 cm3 g respectively the greater surface area would be beneficial for charge transfer and provide more surface active faces for photocatalytic reaction process 3 3 optical properties photocatalytic activity of the semiconductor photocatalyst was highly appraised by its optical absorbance and band energy level the prepared semiconductor photocatalyst were screened for light absorption capacity using uv drs absorbance spectroscopy and showed in fig 6 from fig 6a shows that in2s3 have visible light absorption band but nd2o3 have uv light absorption band by coupling in2s3 and nd2o3 shows visible light absorption with slight modulation from the pure in2s3 the optical absorption of in2s3 in2s3 5 wt nd2o3 in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 in2s3 15 wt nd2o3 and nd2o3 were 614 617 611 607 and 286 nm respectively by coupling of in2s3 and nd2o3 the in2s3 nd2o3 heterojunction nanocomposites were shows blueshift in the absorption of wavelength inset of fig 6a indicates that the peak of in2s3 at 753 nm increases by the addition of nd2o3 from 5 to 15 and confirms the formation of heterostructure in2s3 nd2o3 from tauc s plot the bang gaps of in2s3 in2s3 5 wt nd2o3 in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 in2s3 15 wt nd2o3 and nd2o3 were calculated as 2 01 2 02 2 03 2 04 and 4 33 ev respectively and the results are shown in fig 6b the electronic properties and dynamics of charge carriers were further explored using photoluminescence pl emission spectra and obtained results were illustrated in fig s4 generally speaking the higher intensity indicates the high recombination rate of electron hole and weak photocatalytic activity the pl spectra show the relative emission intensity of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite which was lower than pure in2s3 the lower intensity of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite signify decreased recombination charge carrier which is more beneficial to the improvement of photocatalytic activity at the same time in order further study the properties of photoelectric separation the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic eis of the as prepared photoelectrodes was evaluated fig s5 a large semicircle arc was observed for pure in2s3 indicates its low conductivity by comparison the in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite had smallest radius arc than that of in2s3 and other in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposites due to lower interfacial recombination rate and higher charge transfer ability the relative radius arc of all samples in the eis spectra were decreased as follows in2s3 in2s3 5 wt nd2o3 in2s3 15 wt nd2o3 in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 these results indicated that the combination of in2s3 and nd2o3 could enhance charge separation in the nanocomposites thereby improving its photocatalytic activity 3 4 photocatalytic activity photocatalytic activity of as synthesized in2s3 nd2o3 and in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposites were conducted through the photocatalytic reduction of cr vi and degradation of antibiotic sulfasalazine ssz pollutant under visible light irradiation 3 4 1 photocatalytic reduction of cr vi aqueous k2cr2o7 is used to evaluate the visible light driven photo catalytic reduction of the synthesized photo catalyst toward extremely toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic heavy metal ion cr vi th photocatalytic reduction of cr vi to cr iii is very difficult at neutral ph due to the presence of high dense electron cloud around cr2o7 2 but in this work photoreduction of cr vi by in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposite was carried out under neutral condition 41 to assess the enhanced photoreduction of cr vi first the best heterostructure formation ratio between in2s3 and nd2o3 was investigated fig s6a shows the optimization of different photocatalyst for reduction of cr vi in the aqueous medium efficiency of photocatalytic reduction of pure nd2o3 pure in2s3 in2s3 5 wt nd2o3 in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 and in2s3 15 wt nd2o3 were 7 33 60 44 84 98 95 23 and 75 82 within 35 min of irradiations respectively among the various photocatalyst in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 have the superior photocatalytic reduction efficiency of 95 23 with maximum rate constant k 0 07874 min 1 therefore in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 form a good heterostructure in this composition and the excited electrons were effectively transferred and stabilized if the quantity of nd2o3 increased above 10 wt the photocatalytic process slow down fig s6b c this was due to the fact that excess of nd2o3 interrupt the contact between in2s3 and incident light which suppress the rate of photocatalysis 10 fig s6b c shows the kinetic plots of photocatalytic reduction of cr vi by different photocatalytic nanocomposites the kinetic data were specified in table s2 and it agrees with pseudo first order kinetics to optimize the quantity of photocatalyst in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 was examined via varying the catalyst dose from 40 to 60 mg and shown in fig s6d the figure revealed that the efficiency of the photocatalyst increase from 40 to 50 mg because the number of active sites increases with the increasing of catalyst dosage but further increase of catalyst from 50 to 60 mg the efficiency of the photocatalyst decreases because by excess dosage of photocatalyst inhibit the penetration of light and favours reflection more over than absorption of light therefore the optimum catalytic dosage was found to be 50 mg of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 the kinetic graph of catalytic concentration was shown in the fig s6e f the graph revealed that 50 mg of photocatalyst have greater rate of 0 78743 min 1 the rate constant of other catalytic concentrations 40 and 60 mg in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 were 0 03288 min 1 and 0 05279 min 1 respectively the kinetic value matches with pseudo first order kinetic models 29 initial concentration of cr vi is an important phenomenon to assess the photocatalytic efficiency the effect of initial concentration of cr vi was determined by varying the concentration of cr vi from 40 to 60 mg l for in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 and shown in the fig 7a photo reduction efficiency of cr vi decreased to a certain extent with the increase of cr vi concentrations this reason for the fall in photocatalytic efficiency is by increasing the pollutant concentration a greater number of reactive species was produced and these reactive species can compete with the pollutants for catalytic contact these decreases the photocatalytic efficiency of catalyst 42 the kinetic curve of cr vi was shown in fig 7b c and it matches well with pseudo first order kinetics optimistically 50 mg of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 shows greater degradation efficiency in the 40 mg l of cr vi from the uv visible spectrum fig 7d it was clearly noted that the characteristic absorption peak of cr 372 nm gradually diminishes with increase time of irradiations 3 4 2 photocatalytic degradation of sulphasalazine ssz the antibiotic ssz was chosen to assess the photocatalytic oxidation of the synthesized photocatalyst under visible light irradiation photooxidation of ssz was investigated by pure in2s3 pure nd2o3 in2s3 5 wt nd2o3 in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 and in2s3 15 wt nd2o3 fig s7a reveals that ssz not undergo self degradation with light irradiations the photooxidation of ssz takes place only after the addition of photocatalyst the photocatalytic degradation of ssz observed from the reduction of the main absorption peak at 359 nm the in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 shows greater efficiency among the various synthesized photocatalyst which degrades 96 19 of ssz within 80 min other photocatalyst such as nd2o3 in2s3 in2s3 5 wt nd2o3 and in2s3 15 wt nd2o3 degrades 05 13 60 52 69 95 and 80 93 respectively under similar conditions the composite has enhanced catalytic performance than that of the individual photocatalyst due to the charge separation by the formation of heterojunction the photocatalytic degradation of ssz was kinetically studied by using the langmuir hinshelwood model fig s7b c it agrees with the pseudo first order model the kinetic data were given in table s3 the maximum rate constant was achieved by in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite which k value was 0 03533 min 1 to optimize the weight of photocatalyst in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite was varied from 40 to 60 mg in the constant ssz concentration fig s7d clarifies that degradation efficiency of photocatalyst increases from 40 to 50 mg this is because of increasing the number of active sites increases photocatalytic efficiency while the photo oxidation efficiency decreases further increase into 50 mg due to less incident light harvesting increasing the catalyst weight beyond the optimum dosage switch off the activated molecules by screen them from the light the kinetics of the dose variation is given in fig s7e f the graph shows that 50 mg of photocatalyst have superior rate of 0 03533 min 1 the rate constant of other catalytic dosage 40 and 60 mg of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 are 0 013 min 1 and 0 01964 min 1 respectively the initial concentration of ssz makes an important role in the photooxidation the effect of initial concentration of ssz was investigated from 10 to 30 mg l under the same identical conditions fig 8a the efficiency of degradation first increases to certain extent and then decreases with the increase of ssz concentrations this is because of to produce optimum number reactive intermediates it requires optimum ssz concentration further increase of ssz concentration increases the active spices and compete with ssz for active site it decreases the photocatalytic efficiency of catalyst the kinetic curve of ssz was shown in fig 8b c it matches with pseudo first order kinetics optimistically 50 mg of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 have superior photodegradation efficiency in the 20 mg l of ssz its uv visible spectrum was given in fig 8d from the fig 8a it was clearly noted that the characteristic absorption peak of ssz 359 nm gradually diminishes with increase of time 3 4 3 role of reactive oxidative intermediates in order to identify the superior reactive intermediate radical trapping experiments were carried out iso propyl alcohol ipa 4 benzoquinone bq nacl and agno3 43 44 are chosen as the trapping agents for oh o2 h and e respectively for the photocatalytic oxidation of ssz fig 9a shows that the photocatalytic removal of ssz was decreased by the addition of quenchers compared to the blank experiment the photocatalytic efficiency of the trapping agents such as ipa bq nacl and agno3 were 11 43 72 45 23 25 and 87 58 respectively these data reveals that all the reactive intermediates were participated in the photooxidation of ssz though all the reactive intermediate involved the rate of degradation of ssz was greatly reduced by the addition of ipa therefore it can be decided that oh acts as the leading reactive intermediate to activate the photooxidation of ssz and shrink the efficiency from 96 19 to 11 43 there was no considerable change in the photooxidation of ssz by agno3 therefore the reductive species electron acts as less predominant species among all active species fig 9b indicates the kinetics of scavenger study and revealed that the rate of the reaction was highly reduced by ipa depending upon the rate the involvement of active intermediates in the order of their importance as follows oh h o2 e fig 9c revealed that photo reduction of cr vi greatly influenced by the addition of reductive scavenger agno3 which indicates e was the chief reactive intermediate in the photoreduction of cr vi this indicates photogenerated electrons were used to reduce cr vi by the addition of agno3 photocatalytic reduction was suppressed from 95 24 to 12 21 this was confirmed by fig 9d the rate of the photo reduction of cr vi was highly affected by agno3 the decreasing order of the reactive intermediates in the photoreduction of cr vi was e o2 oh h 3 4 4 photostability and reusability the photostability and reusability of the as prepared photocatalyst was investigated by doing five successive degradation of ssz and cr vi under similar condition the photocatalyst is recycled by centrifuging and it was reused after washed with water and ethanol for each run fig s8 shows that after the fifth cycle the catalytic efficiency was only decreased by 7 for ssz degradation and 4 for cr vi reduction it shows that the photocatalyst was considerably good photostability generally the slight decline of photocatalytic efficiency is attributed to the inevitable loss of photocatalysts during the recycle runs the photostability of the photocatalyst was confirmed by xrd patterns of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 before and after photocatalyst is shown in fig s9 the xrd pattern reveals that the crystallinity of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 not change before after photocatalysis negligible changes in crystal phases were observed over five consecutive cycles of ssz degradation under visible light illumination this proves the photostability of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite 3 5 possible photocatalytic mechanism the valance band potential evb and conduction band potential of pure in2s3 and pure nd2o3 are determined by using mullikan electronegativity formula eqs 5 6 5 e vb χ e 0 0 5e g 6 e cb e vb e g where evb and ecb are the valance band and conduction band respectively χ is the electronegativity of the semiconductors e0 is the hydrogen scale 4 5 ev for the energy of free electron and eg is the optical energy gap of semiconductors the band gap of pure in2s3 and nd2o3 are 2 02 ev and 4 33 ev as shown in fig 6b the valance band evb edge potential of in2s3 and nd2o3 were calculated from eq 5 as 1 19 ev and 3 295 ev respectively the conduction band ecb edge potential of in2s3 and nd2o3 were obtained from eq 6 as 0 83 ev and 1 035 ev respectively 45 46 additionally the mott schottky plot fig s10 of in2s3 shows positive slope in the linear region of plots which indicates an n type semiconducting characteristic thus the conduction band potential of pure in2s3 was found to be 0 83 ev based on the above characterization and discussion the possible mechanism is schematically illustrated by fig 10 and eqs 7 12 the improvisation of electron hole separation and speed up the electron electrons are reorganizing the behaviour of photocatalyst in the first step the pollutant particles ssz and cr vi adsorbed on the surface of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 catalyst eq 7 under visible light irradiation only in2s3 excited and the electrons e from valence band vb of in2s3 jumped to the conduction band cb and produce holes h in the vb eq 8 simultaneously under visible light the nd3 ions in nd2o3 absorb photons and converts into uv light which is then excited to generate electron hole pairs 47 when in2s3 nd2o3 forms a n p type heterojunction the fermi level of in2s3 moves downwards while the fermi level of the nd2o3 moves upward until the fermi level of in2s3 and nd2o3 is at the same level based on the mott schottky analysis and mullikan calculation the ecb of nd2o3 is more negative than in2s3 thus the photoinduced electrons transferred to the cb of in2s3 similarly the holes were moved to the vb of in2s3 due to the more positive vb positions of nd2o3 these photoexcited electrons simultaneously reduce cr vi to non toxic cr iii eq 10 and produce o2 radicals from o2 eq 11 the formed o2 can convert h2o molecule to oh and ho2 eq 12 therefore all the active species e h o2 and oh were formed and oxidize the antibiotic ssz to intermediate products finally co2 and h2o eq 13 the scavenger study also revealed that oh was the predominant species in ssz photooxidation and photoelectrons were played essential role in the photoreduction of cr vi 7 in 2 s 3 nd 2 o 3 ssz cr vi adsorption in 2 s 3 nd 2 o 3 ssz cr vi 8 in 2 s 3 nd 2 o 3 ssz cr vi hv vis in 2 s 3 h e nd 2 o 3 ssz cr vi 9 in 2 s 3 h e nd 2 o 3 ssz cr vi in 2 s 3 h nd 2 o 3 e ssz cr vi 10 e cr vi cr iii 11 e o 2 o 2 12 o 2 h 2 o oh ho 2 13 ssz oh h o 2 e intermediates co 2 h 2 o recently many research work going on for the enhancement of photocatalytic degradation of ssz and photoreduction of cr vi table 1 shows list of some photo catalyst and their activity against ssz and cr vi in recent years this explores that in2s3 nd2o3 heterojunction catalyst could efficiently enhance the photocatalytic performance for removal of heavy metal and antibiotic pollutant 4 conclusion in summary in2s3 nd2o3 heterojunction photocatalysts with enhanced efficiency were fabricated by two step facile process including hydrothermal and ultrasonication strategies the resultant heterojunction possess superior photocatalytic efficiency against ssz degradation and cr vi reduction compared to the pure in2s3 and nd2o3 the improved photocatalytic efficiency of the catalyst described the enhanced visible light absorption ability and intimate interfacial contact between in2s3 and nd2o3 leads the effective charge separation and migration during photoexcitation the reactive oxidation species ros scavenger experiment revealed that oh and e played a vital role in the photooxidation of ssz and photoreduction of cr vi respectively the fabricated in2s3 nd2o3 photocatalyst have excellent photostability and reusability because efficiency was only reduced only by 4 for cr vi and 7 for ssz after the fifth run thus the heterojunction formed by coupling in2s3 with nd2o3 act as a promising photocatalyst for the environmental remediation declaration of competing interest

electrochemical properties consequently the efficient photocatalyst were studied double role photooxidation of sulfasalazine ssz and photoreduction of cr vi in environmental modal water pollutants under visible light illumination the catalytic activity of in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposite was found to be dependent an optimal in2s3 10wt nd2o3 and dose contact time and concentration of the pollutant the maximum efficiency attainment of the cr vi reduction was 95 23 and ssz degradation was 96 19 within 35 and 80 min respectively which was multi fold times greater than the efficiency of pristine in2s3 and nd2o3 the enhanced efficiency pointed out the proper band alignment and intimate interfacial contact in the in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 p n heterojunction which facilitate the better charge separation and transfer between in2s3 and nd2o3 photocatalyst the photocatalyst have superior photostability and better recyclability after the fifth run the activity was only reduced 4 for cr vi and 7 for ssz finally a plausible band alignment and favourable charge transfer pathway for the generation oxidative species were proposed depends upon the scavenger study this study reveals the versatile nature of in2s3 xnd2o3 heterojunction and its efficient photocatalysis of both emerging pharmaceutical contaminant and heavy metal in water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords in2s3 nd2o3 heterojunction sulfasalazine photodegradation cr vi photoreduction visible light illumination 1 introduction over the past few decades visible photon driven heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysis has been proved as an environmental benign sustainable innovative resolution to the major global troubles such as energy paucity and environmental crises predominantly pollution caused by water contaminants 1 3 the partly treated industrial effluents contain dyes phenols antibiotics and heavy metals which are pollutes the water bodies and make harmful to the aquatics and human beings 4 6 commonly tio2 is used to treat water pollutants due to its non toxicity stability and high efficiency in presence of uv light 7 the applications of tio2 based materials are limited because of higher rate of electron hole recombination low quantum efficiency and band gap mismatch with sunlight 8 10 therefore fabrication of novel low cost and efficient visible photon driven semiconductor photocatalyst seeks more attention among the researchers 11 12 metal sulphides proved as a most competent semiconductor photocatalyst among the various semiconductors for the photochemical conversions indium sulfide in2s3 is a visible light responsive n type semiconductor photocatalyst with promising optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications 13 14 in2s3 nanomaterial have superior photocatalytic activity due to its exciting characteristics such as exceptional absorption coefficient high photoelectric sensitivity excellent carrier mobility moderate band gap superior stability and low toxicity 15 cheng et al found that hollow in2s3 cdin2s4 composite photocatalyst could be formed by hydrothermal method and followed ultrasound sonication which possess the superior photocatalytic cr vi reduction 16 for instance yang et al reported that ca ii doped β in2s3 showed higher photocatalytic hydrogen generation and organic dye degradation under visible light irradiation 17 chen et al fabricated porous tubular in2s3 in2o3 for efficient photocatalytic h2o2 production in pure water system 18 though it has all superior characteristics for photocatalytic activity it suffers mainly with rapid recombination of the photogenerated electron hole pairs this decreases its quantum and photo catalytic efficiency to enhance the photocatalytic activity of indium sulphide it may combine with electron acceptors such as doped with noble metals and carbon materials or constructing in2s3 based heterostructures 19 20 neodymium oxide nd2o3 is a p type semiconductor with wide range of applications due to its unique optical behaviour such as photonic application luminescent and thermo luminescent materials 21 22 ajabshir et al synthesized nd2o3 via a simple precipitation method and applied for the efficient degradation of methylene blue 23 in recent decades pharmaceutical compounds were regularly found in water sources due to the improper discharge of industrial effluents hospital waste and diametrical waste sulfasalazine ssz is an azo based sulfa drug with antibacterial anti inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties ssz is widely used to treat crohn s disease juvenile rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis 24 25 now a days ssz is frequently found in the various environments such as surface and ground water bodies ssz in the aquatic environment affect the ecosystem and make a severe risk to human life by food chain it is essential to remove ssz from the aquatics to diminish the harmful impacts of ssz to human being and the ecosystem 26 heavy metal ion hexavalent chromium cr vi is one of the major hazardous industrial pollutants which enters from electroplating leather tanning paint and pigment and textile dyeing industries cr iv is more toxic and carcinogenic than cr iii due to its high mobility high stability hard to reduce and effective toxicity it acts as great to ecosystem and human being 27 28 concentration of cr vi in drinking water exceeds 0 1 mg l it create fetal malformation and cancer in the oral cavity and small intestine cr vi also causes a lot of health issues such as lung malignancies chronic inhalation pain and toxicity in the liver 29 30 toxicity of cr vi decreases by convert to into cr iii and cr iii act as the micronutrient for human being therefore its necessary to reduce and takeout cr vi from the ecosystem to safeguard the human lives and aquatics 31 in this present study we successfully designed a novel n in2s3 p nd2o3 heterojunction photocatalyst by hydrothermal followed by an ultrasonication strategy as prepared n in2s3 p nd2o3 nanocomposites were systematically characterized by various spectroscopic and analytical tools such as xrd xps sem edx tem bet and uv drs the photocatalytic degradation of ssz and reduction of cr vi were investigated with different operational parameters the roles of reactive species in the photocatalytic reaction processes were revealed via quenching test finally the possible reduction oxidation mechanism of n in2s3 p nd2o3 heterojunction was also proposed 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and methods in

above solution and stirred constantly for 3 h then the above mixture of solution was transferred into a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave 100 ml and retained at 180 c for 20 h the solution was then cooled down to room temperature the light purple color of nd2o3 was washed several times with dd water and ethyl alcohol the collected nd2o3 was dried at 80 c for overnight and calcinated at 900 c for 4 h in the muffle furnace in2s3 nd2o3 heterostructures was prepared by a simple ultrasonication method 16 32 0 2 g of as prepared in2s3 microspheres was dispersed into 30 ml of ethyl alcohol solution the loading mass ratio of in2s3 to nd2o3 was ensured as 5 10 and 15 for this process of synthesis the resulting mixture of solution was ultrasonicated for 3 h and dried at 60 c 2 3 photocatalytic experiments the photocatalytic activities of as prepared pure in2s3 nd2o3 and in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposites were assessed by the degradation of various contaminants such as an antibiotic sulphasalazine ssz and cr vi in this experimental analysis 300 w power of tungsten lamp was used as the source of visible light for this reaction 50 mg of catalyst was added into 100 ml of ssz 20 mg l or cr vi 40 mg l solution prior of visible light the reaction solution was stirred for 30 min in dark condition to obtain equilibrium between catalyst and pollutants the reaction solution was stirred vigorously throughout the process at the regular intervals 4 ml of the suspension of aliquots were separated to measure the pollutants concentration at particular wavelength with uv vis spectrometer shimadzu 2600 after the completion of photocatalytic degradation the catalyst was recycled or removed by ultracentrifugation and dried to do the further reusability experiments 2 4 characterization

integrating sphere using ba2so4 as the standard reflectance the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface areas of the samples were determined by nitrogen adsorption desorption pl spectra was recorded by using cary eclipse fluorescence spectrometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 xrd and xps analysis the effect of loading of nd2o3 on in2s3 is analyzed by xrd and shown in fig 1 all the diffraction patterns of pure in2s3 agreement with the jcpds card no 65 0459 19 this shows that in2s3 were face centre cubic phase with major diffraction peaks 111 222 400 and 440 at 2θ values 14 57 27 25 32 82 and 47 45 respectively the lattice parameter was found to be a 10 77 å with a cell volume of 1250 64 å the diffraction patterns of pure nd2o3 have a good agreement with the jcpds card no 74 2139 33 the pure nd2o3 have primitive hexagonal phase with the strong diffraction pattern at 2θ values 30 22 26 35 and 46 92 with the diffraction patterns 011 100 and 110 respectively the lattice parameter of unit cell found to be a 3 831 å and c 5 999 å with a cell volume of 76 25 å as for the in2s3 nd2o3 heterostructures all the diffraction patterns of in2s3 were observed in all the three samples and the peak intensity of nd2o3 increases gradually with the increase of the loading especially the intensities of crystal planes 110 and 012 increases from in2s3 5 wt nd2o3 to in2s3 15 wt nd2o3 therefore it could be concluded that the in2s3 nd2o3 nanomaterials were successfully synthesized by ultra sonication method existence of sharp and intense peaks indicates their high crystalline nature therefore various structural parameters were calculated from the xrd pattern average crystalline size d dislocation density δ micro strain ε and stacking fault were calculated from the formula 1 4 and tabulated in table s1 1 crystalline size d 0 94 λ β cos θ 2 dislocation density δ 1 d 2 3 micro strain ε β cos θ 4 4 stacking fault 2 π 2 45 tanθ 1 2 β the value of crystalline parameter decreases it becomes highly crystalline the values of table s1 shows that all the prepared samples are highly crystalline especially among the three different ratios of in2s3 nd2o3 and in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 was highly crystalline in order to study the chemical states and surface chemical composition of the nd2o3 and in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposite the xps analysis was carried out fig 2 all the chemical elements such as in s nd and o characteristic peaks were calibrated by carbon c1s peak 284 6 ev caused by stray carbon fig 2a the nd3d fig 2b was divided into two peaks at 981 1 and 1004 1 ev assigned to the nd 3d5 2 and nd 3d3 2 orbital spin splitting of nd 3d with an energy difference of 23 0 ev the small shoulder peak at 977 5 ev correspond to the transfer of electron from the oxygen to nd 4f3 orbital 34 compared to pure nd2o3 the binding energies of nd 3d5 2 and nd 3d3 2 dramatically shifted and decreased in that of the in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposite 35 the o1s spectrum fig 2c shows the characteristic peak at 530 4 ev which was owing to the lattice oxygen ions in the nd2o3 crystal lattice and there was also a small peak at 527 7 ev ascribed to non lattice oxygen ions 36 in addition the intensity of o1s in the in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposite was dropped compared to bare nd2o3 and an appeared new peak at 532 4 ev could also be assigned to surface adsorbed oh from the air atmosphere the xps spectra of in3d fig 2d can be deconvoluted into four peaks at 443 3 445 9 450 7 and 453 3 ev the two high intensity binding energy at 443 3 and 450 7 ev are attributed to in 3d5 2 and in 3d3 2 respectively indicating that in3 oxidation state of in2s3 another weak satellite peaks at 445 9 and 453 3 ev corresponds to the in oh 3 phase 37 the s2p spectrum can be deconstructed into three peaks located at 159 7 160 9 and 163 1 ev were related to the s 2p3 2 s 2p1 2 and sulfate groups c so2 associated to s6 as shown in fig 2e 38 3 2 morphological and surface area analysis texture and morphology of the as synthesized in2s3 and in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposite were investigated by sem analysis and depicted in fig 3 from fig 3a clearly indicates that in2s3 has the morphology of nano flakes assembled flowers like structure the inset of fig 3a shows the enlarged image of in2s3 39 40 fig 3b shows the sem image of nd2o3 which has nanosponge like morphology fig 3c clearly picturise that the nd2o3 nonosponges are embedded on the surface of in2s3 nanoflowers and illustrate the in2s3 nd2o3 heterostructure formation fig s2 shows the edax spectrum of pure in2s3 nd2o3 and the in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite edax spectrum exposes the purity and composition of the synthesized nanomaterial the fig s2 clearly indicates that the presence of indium in and sulphur s in in2s3 neodymium nd and oxygen o in nd2o3 and existence of in nd s and o in in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite without any impurities the elemental mapping of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite is given in fig s3 it reveals the fragmentation of elements in nd s and o by the colors of blue yellow green and red for the given sem image the detailed invetigation about the morphology and micro structural information of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 was examined by tem and hrtem fig 4 the fig 4a and b picturizes tem images of in2s3 and in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 tem image confirmed that the nd2o3 nanosponges were covered by in2s3 nano wrinkles and coincide with the sem images the lattice fringes of in2s3 and in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposite are dipicted in fig 4c d inset the lattice spacing 0 38 nm matched with the planes 220 of cubic phase in2s3 and the fringes of the lattice 0 29 nm matches with the plane 011 of nd2o3 fig 4e f gives the selected area electron diffraction saed pattern of the pure in2s3 and in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposite which reveals that the high crystalline nature of the structures and consistent with xrd analysis surface area and pore sizes of the pure nd2o3 and the in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite was accessed by using brunauer emmett teller bet analysis and their corresponding pore size distribution plots are displayed in fig 5 the n2 adsorption and desorption isotherms for nd2o3 and the in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 which represent typical type iv physisorption with a h3 hysteresis loop in the iupac classification it could be seen that surface area of nd2o3 and the in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite was 34 57 and 33 92 m2 g respectively from the fig 5 inset the mean pore diameter nd2o3 and the in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 was found to be 2 21 and 9 49 nm which corresponds to the pore volume of 0 072 and 0 195 cm3 g respectively the greater surface area would be beneficial for charge transfer and provide more surface active faces for photocatalytic reaction process 3 3 optical properties photocatalytic activity of the semiconductor photocatalyst was highly appraised by its optical absorbance and band energy level the prepared semiconductor photocatalyst were screened for light absorption capacity using uv drs absorbance spectroscopy and showed in fig 6 from fig 6a shows that in2s3 have visible light absorption band but nd2o3 have uv light absorption band by coupling in2s3 and nd2o3 shows visible light absorption with slight modulation from the pure in2s3 the optical absorption of in2s3 in2s3 5 wt nd2o3 in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 in2s3 15 wt nd2o3 and nd2o3 were 614 617 611 607 and 286 nm respectively by coupling of in2s3 and nd2o3 the in2s3 nd2o3 heterojunction nanocomposites were shows blueshift in the absorption of wavelength inset of fig 6a indicates that the peak of in2s3 at 753 nm increases by the addition of nd2o3 from 5 to 15 and confirms the formation of heterostructure in2s3 nd2o3 from tauc s plot the bang gaps of in2s3 in2s3 5 wt nd2o3 in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 in2s3 15 wt nd2o3 and nd2o3 were calculated as 2 01 2 02 2 03 2 04 and 4 33 ev respectively and the results are shown in fig 6b the electronic properties and dynamics of charge carriers were further explored using photoluminescence pl emission spectra and obtained results were illustrated in fig s4 generally speaking the higher intensity indicates the high recombination rate of electron hole and weak photocatalytic activity the pl spectra show the relative emission intensity of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite which was lower than pure in2s3 the lower intensity of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite signify decreased recombination charge carrier which is more beneficial to the improvement of photocatalytic activity at the same time in order further study the properties of photoelectric separation the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic eis of the as prepared photoelectrodes was evaluated fig s5 a large semicircle arc was observed for pure in2s3 indicates its low conductivity by comparison the in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite had smallest radius arc than that of in2s3 and other in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposites due to lower interfacial recombination rate and higher charge transfer ability the relative radius arc of all samples in the eis spectra were decreased as follows in2s3 in2s3 5 wt nd2o3 in2s3 15 wt nd2o3 in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 these results indicated that the combination of in2s3 and nd2o3 could enhance charge separation in the nanocomposites thereby improving its photocatalytic activity 3 4 photocatalytic activity photocatalytic activity of as synthesized in2s3 nd2o3 and in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposites were conducted through the photocatalytic reduction of cr vi and degradation of antibiotic sulfasalazine ssz pollutant under visible light irradiation 3 4 1 photocatalytic reduction of cr vi aqueous k2cr2o7 is used to evaluate the visible light driven photo catalytic reduction of the synthesized photo catalyst toward extremely toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic heavy metal ion cr vi th photocatalytic reduction of cr vi to cr iii is very difficult at neutral ph due to the presence of high dense electron cloud around cr2o7 2 but in this work photoreduction of cr vi by in2s3 nd2o3 nanocomposite was carried out under neutral condition 41 to assess the enhanced photoreduction of cr vi first the best heterostructure formation ratio between in2s3 and nd2o3 was investigated fig s6a shows the optimization of different photocatalyst for reduction of cr vi in the aqueous medium efficiency of photocatalytic reduction of pure nd2o3 pure in2s3 in2s3 5 wt nd2o3 in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 and in2s3 15 wt nd2o3 were 7 33 60 44 84 98 95 23 and 75 82 within 35 min of irradiations respectively among the various photocatalyst in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 have the superior photocatalytic reduction efficiency of 95 23 with maximum rate constant k 0 07874 min 1 therefore in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 form a good heterostructure in this composition and the excited electrons were effectively transferred and stabilized if the quantity of nd2o3 increased above 10 wt the photocatalytic process slow down fig s6b c this was due to the fact that excess of nd2o3 interrupt the contact between in2s3 and incident light which suppress the rate of photocatalysis 10 fig s6b c shows the kinetic plots of photocatalytic reduction of cr vi by different photocatalytic nanocomposites the kinetic data were specified in table s2 and it agrees with pseudo first order kinetics to optimize the quantity of photocatalyst in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 was examined via varying the catalyst dose from 40 to 60 mg and shown in fig s6d the figure revealed that the efficiency of the photocatalyst increase from 40 to 50 mg because the number of active sites increases with the increasing of catalyst dosage but further increase of catalyst from 50 to 60 mg the efficiency of the photocatalyst decreases because by excess dosage of photocatalyst inhibit the penetration of light and favours reflection more over than absorption of light therefore the optimum catalytic dosage was found to be 50 mg of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 the kinetic graph of catalytic concentration was shown in the fig s6e f the graph revealed that 50 mg of photocatalyst have greater rate of 0 78743 min 1 the rate constant of other catalytic concentrations 40 and 60 mg in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 were 0 03288 min 1 and 0 05279 min 1 respectively the kinetic value matches with pseudo first order kinetic models 29 initial concentration of cr vi is an important phenomenon to assess the photocatalytic efficiency the effect of initial concentration of cr vi was determined by varying the concentration of cr vi from 40 to 60 mg l for in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 and shown in the fig 7a photo reduction efficiency of cr vi decreased to a certain extent with the increase of cr vi concentrations this reason for the fall in photocatalytic efficiency is by increasing the pollutant concentration a greater number of reactive species was produced and these reactive species can compete with the pollutants for catalytic contact these decreases the photocatalytic efficiency of catalyst 42 the kinetic curve of cr vi was shown in fig 7b c and it matches well with pseudo first order kinetics optimistically 50 mg of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 shows greater degradation efficiency in the 40 mg l of cr vi from the uv visible spectrum fig 7d it was clearly noted that the characteristic absorption peak of cr 372 nm gradually diminishes with increase time of irradiations 3 4 2 photocatalytic degradation of sulphasalazine ssz the antibiotic ssz was chosen to assess the photocatalytic oxidation of the synthesized photocatalyst under visible light irradiation photooxidation of ssz was investigated by pure in2s3 pure nd2o3 in2s3 5 wt nd2o3 in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 and in2s3 15 wt nd2o3 fig s7a reveals that ssz not undergo self degradation with light irradiations the photooxidation of ssz takes place only after the addition of photocatalyst the photocatalytic degradation of ssz observed from the reduction of the main absorption peak at 359 nm the in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 shows greater efficiency among the various synthesized photocatalyst which degrades 96 19 of ssz within 80 min other photocatalyst such as nd2o3 in2s3 in2s3 5 wt nd2o3 and in2s3 15 wt nd2o3 degrades 05 13 60 52 69 95 and 80 93 respectively under similar conditions the composite has enhanced catalytic performance than that of the individual photocatalyst due to the charge separation by the formation of heterojunction the photocatalytic degradation of ssz was kinetically studied by using the langmuir hinshelwood model fig s7b c it agrees with the pseudo first order model the kinetic data were given in table s3 the maximum rate constant was achieved by in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite which k value was 0 03533 min 1 to optimize the weight of photocatalyst in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite was varied from 40 to 60 mg in the constant ssz concentration fig s7d clarifies that degradation efficiency of photocatalyst increases from 40 to 50 mg this is because of increasing the number of active sites increases photocatalytic efficiency while the photo oxidation efficiency decreases further increase into 50 mg due to less incident light harvesting increasing the catalyst weight beyond the optimum dosage switch off the activated molecules by screen them from the light the kinetics of the dose variation is given in fig s7e f the graph shows that 50 mg of photocatalyst have superior rate of 0 03533 min 1 the rate constant of other catalytic dosage 40 and 60 mg of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 are 0 013 min 1 and 0 01964 min 1 respectively the initial concentration of ssz makes an important role in the photooxidation the effect of initial concentration of ssz was investigated from 10 to 30 mg l under the same identical conditions fig 8a the efficiency of degradation first increases to certain extent and then decreases with the increase of ssz concentrations this is because of to produce optimum number reactive intermediates it requires optimum ssz concentration further increase of ssz concentration increases the active spices and compete with ssz for active site it decreases the photocatalytic efficiency of catalyst the kinetic curve of ssz was shown in fig 8b c it matches with pseudo first order kinetics optimistically 50 mg of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 have superior photodegradation efficiency in the 20 mg l of ssz its uv visible spectrum was given in fig 8d from the fig 8a it was clearly noted that the characteristic absorption peak of ssz 359 nm gradually diminishes with increase of time 3 4 3 role of reactive oxidative intermediates in order to identify the superior reactive intermediate radical trapping experiments were carried out iso propyl alcohol ipa 4 benzoquinone bq nacl and agno3 43 44 are chosen as the trapping agents for oh o2 h and e respectively for the photocatalytic oxidation of ssz fig 9a shows that the photocatalytic removal of ssz was decreased by the addition of quenchers compared to the blank experiment the photocatalytic efficiency of the trapping agents such as ipa bq nacl and agno3 were 11 43 72 45 23 25 and 87 58 respectively these data reveals that all the reactive intermediates were participated in the photooxidation of ssz though all the reactive intermediate involved the rate of degradation of ssz was greatly reduced by the addition of ipa therefore it can be decided that oh acts as the leading reactive intermediate to activate the photooxidation of ssz and shrink the efficiency from 96 19 to 11 43 there was no considerable change in the photooxidation of ssz by agno3 therefore the reductive species electron acts as less predominant species among all active species fig 9b indicates the kinetics of scavenger study and revealed that the rate of the reaction was highly reduced by ipa depending upon the rate the involvement of active intermediates in the order of their importance as follows oh h o2 e fig 9c revealed that photo reduction of cr vi greatly influenced by the addition of reductive scavenger agno3 which indicates e was the chief reactive intermediate in the photoreduction of cr vi this indicates photogenerated electrons were used to reduce cr vi by the addition of agno3 photocatalytic reduction was suppressed from 95 24 to 12 21 this was confirmed by fig 9d the rate of the photo reduction of cr vi was highly affected by agno3 the decreasing order of the reactive intermediates in the photoreduction of cr vi was e o2 oh h 3 4 4 photostability and reusability the photostability and reusability of the as prepared photocatalyst was investigated by doing five successive degradation of ssz and cr vi under similar condition the photocatalyst is recycled by centrifuging and it was reused after washed with water and ethanol for each run fig s8 shows that after the fifth cycle the catalytic efficiency was only decreased by 7 for ssz degradation and 4 for cr vi reduction it shows that the photocatalyst was considerably good photostability generally the slight decline of photocatalytic efficiency is attributed to the inevitable loss of photocatalysts during the recycle runs the photostability of the photocatalyst was confirmed by xrd patterns of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 before and after photocatalyst is shown in fig s9 the xrd pattern reveals that the crystallinity of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 not change before after photocatalysis negligible changes in crystal phases were observed over five consecutive cycles of ssz degradation under visible light illumination this proves the photostability of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 nanocomposite 3 5 possible photocatalytic mechanism the valance band potential evb and conduction band potential of pure in2s3 and pure nd2o3 are determined by using mullikan electronegativity formula eqs 5 6 5 e vb χ e 0 0 5e g 6 e cb e vb e g where evb and ecb are the valance band and conduction band respectively χ is the electronegativity of the semiconductors e0 is the hydrogen scale 4 5 ev for the energy of free electron and eg is the optical energy gap of semiconductors the band gap of pure in2s3 and nd2o3 are 2 02 ev and 4 33 ev as shown in fig 6b the valance band evb edge potential of in2s3 and nd2o3 were calculated from eq 5 as 1 19 ev and 3 295 ev respectively the conduction band ecb edge potential of in2s3 and nd2o3 were obtained from eq 6 as 0 83 ev and 1 035 ev respectively 45 46 additionally the mott schottky plot fig s10 of in2s3 shows positive slope in the linear region of plots which indicates an n type semiconducting characteristic thus the conduction band potential of pure in2s3 was found to be 0 83 ev based on the above characterization and discussion the possible mechanism is schematically illustrated by fig 10 and eqs 7 12 the improvisation of electron hole separation and speed up the electron electrons are reorganizing the behaviour of photocatalyst in the first step the pollutant particles ssz and cr vi adsorbed on the surface of in2s3 10 wt nd2o3 catalyst eq 7 under visible light irradiation only in2s3 excited and the electrons e from valence band vb of in2s3 jumped to the conduction band cb and produce holes h in the vb eq 8 simultaneously under visible light the nd3 ions in nd2o3 absorb photons and converts into uv light which is then excited to generate electron hole pairs 47 when in2s3 nd2o3 forms a n p type heterojunction the fermi level of in2s3 moves downwards while the fermi level of the nd2o3 moves upward until the fermi level of in2s3 and nd2o3 is at the same level based on the mott schottky analysis and mullikan calculation the ecb of nd2o3 is more negative than in2s3 thus the photoinduced electrons transferred to the cb of in2s3 similarly the holes were moved to the vb of in2s3 due to the more positive vb positions of nd2o3 these photoexcited electrons simultaneously reduce cr vi to non toxic cr iii eq 10 and produce o2 radicals from o2 eq 11 the formed o2 can convert h2o molecule to oh and ho2 eq 12 therefore all the active species e h o2 and oh were formed and oxidize the antibiotic ssz to intermediate products finally co2 and h2o eq 13 the scavenger study also revealed that oh was the predominant species in ssz photooxidation and photoelectrons were played essential role in the photoreduction of cr vi 7 in 2 s 3 nd 2 o 3 ssz cr vi adsorption in 2 s 3 nd 2 o 3 ssz cr vi 8 in 2 s 3 nd 2 o 3 ssz cr vi hv vis in 2 s 3 h e nd 2 o 3 ssz cr vi 9 in 2 s 3 h e nd 2 o 3 ssz cr vi in 2 s 3 h nd 2 o 3 e ssz cr vi 10 e cr vi cr iii 11 e o 2 o 2 12 o 2 h 2 o oh ho 2 13 ssz oh h o 2 e intermediates co 2 h 2 o recently many research work going on for the enhancement of photocatalytic degradation of ssz and photoreduction of cr vi table 1 shows list of some photo catalyst and their activity against ssz and cr vi in recent years this explores that in2s3 nd2o3 heterojunction catalyst could efficiently enhance the photocatalytic performance for removal of heavy metal and antibiotic pollutant 4 conclusion in summary in2s3 nd2o3 heterojunction photocatalysts with enhanced efficiency were fabricated by two step facile process including hydrothermal and ultrasonication strategies the resultant heterojunction possess superior photocatalytic efficiency against ssz degradation and cr vi reduction compared to the pure in2s3 and nd2o3 the improved photocatalytic efficiency of the catalyst described the enhanced visible light absorption ability and intimate interfacial contact between in2s3 and nd2o3 leads the effective charge separation and migration during photoexcitation the reactive oxidation species ros scavenger experiment revealed that oh and e played a vital role in the photooxidation of ssz and photoreduction of cr vi respectively the fabricated in2s3 nd2o3 photocatalyst have excellent photostability and reusability because efficiency was only reduced only by 4 for cr vi and 7 for ssz after the fifth run thus the heterojunction formed by coupling in2s3 with nd2o3 act as a promising photocatalyst for the environmental remediation declaration of competing interest
