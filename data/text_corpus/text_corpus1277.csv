6385,poljes are large flat closed depressions that can be found in most karst areas around the world they are prone to regular flooding which occurs after abundant rainfall or snowmelt events the floods can form several meters deep intermittent lakes that can persist for months human settlements around poljes have been traditionally positioned above the level of the most severe floods however many neighbouring villages expanded during the last decades to areas that might be endangered by large flood events in addition a recent study has shown that several poljes encountered floods of more severe amplitude in mid holocene due to a prevailing humid climate as current knowledge of polje s hydrology appears to be still insufficient further research is needed this work aims to identify the factors controlling polje flooding and evaluates their impact on the flood amplitude and duration to do so a list of parameters potentially controlling flooding is established the relevance of each parameter is tested by using two idealized numerical models the first one considers exclusively the polje from the springs to the ponors whereas the second integrates the aquifer adjacent to the polje outflow side first results show the usefulness of simple numerical models to identify the effect of each parameter on the flood amplitude and duration the findings are combined to simulate a flood of medium intensity and long duration that occurred on a typical polje a comparison of the results with real data demonstrates that the aquifer draining the polje needs to be considered to understand properly the flooding dynamics the approach presented within this work has the potential to be used in other poljes encountering similar hydrological situations but also lays foundation for flooding modelling in other karst areas keywords polje flood numerical modelling flooding parameters modflow nwt lake swmm 1 introduction karst terrains cover approximately 12 15 of the earth ice free surface and provide freshwater for about 20 25 of the world s population ford and williams 2007 chen et al 2017 despite a less dense surface hydrographic network compared to non karstic areas these regions are prone to an important flood risk parise 2015 floods in karst areas are considered as a disastrous natural hazard that can cause important economic damages and heavy human fatalities bonacci et al 2006 maréchal et al 2008 naughton et al 2017 the floods can be classified in three different categories i the flash flood which occurs shortly after very intense precipitations events on small catchments and concentrates the water in the lowlands of karst terrains bonacci et al 2006 maréchal et al 2008 de waele et al 2010 ii the intermittent flood that occurs regularly in karst enclosed basins such as poljes or turloughs kovačič and ravbar 2010 naughton et al 2012 and iii the groundwater type flood which is caused by a rise of the piezometric level above the ground surface pinault et al 2005 adams et al 2010 hughes et al 2011 ascott et al 2017 floods in poljes can be distinguished from other types of karst floods due to their high amplitude and long duration as well as because of their regularity kovačič and ravbar 2010 these flat closed depressions fig 1 are among the largest geomorphological features existing in karst landscapes with surfaces ranging from 0 5 km2 rašanjsko polje stumberger et al 2014 to more than 400 km2 livanjsko polje lučić 2014 they are found in most karst areas around the world with notable examples in dinaric karst planinsko cerkniško and popovo poljes among others china france spain or greece poljes are ecological areas of primary importance populated by an endemic fauna and flora sackl et al 2014 they have been used for extensive agriculture due to their rich soil cover compared to the surrounding rocky karst landscapes and undergo a larger population pressure than the rest of the karst regions lópez chicano et al 2002 water enters poljes through the springs located at their rims and sinks through ponors which are generally located on the polje borders in addition poljes can be fed drained through estavelles which act as springs or ponors depending on the head in the surrounding aquifer albéric 2004 from a hydrogeological point of view a polje is an integral part of the karst aquifer that provides its recharge and drains its outflow it can be considered as a natural surface reservoir that buffers floodwater gams 1978 ford and williams 2007 bonacci 2013 human settlements have been traditionally positioned above the level of the most severe floods however many towns expanded during the last decades to areas endangered by large flood events as an example floods of february 2014 in planinsko polje slovenia were the highest in the last 80 years and created an over 10 3 km2 large intermittent lake the maximum water level recorded at the gauging station was of 8 26 m with a volume of 73 million m3 frantar and ulaga 2015 the lake remained for almost two months and flooded over 40 houses and other facilities in two villages causing important economic damages in a broader view 37 of the 57 poljes of bosnia and herzegovina are prone to regular flood events sackl et al 2014 summing up to an overall area of 802 6 km2 for potential flooding in this country moreover a recent sediment analysis in several caves terraces and pocket valleys from southwest slovenia stepišnik et al 2012 ferk 2016 showed that extreme floods may have occurred during mid holocene 8000 5500 y bp in planinsko and cerkniško poljes due to a more humid climate benito et al 2015 these floods are assumed to have reached almost 50 m above the poljes surface and should have lasted much longer than current extreme events this demonstrates that floods in poljes are a potential threat due to changing climatic conditions especially if extreme events should happen more frequently in the future ribes et al 2018 up to now most hydrogeological studies dedicated to poljes were done for engineering purposes milanović 2004 several poljes were changed to permanent reservoirs by building a dam in order to use their storage capacity for drinking water bileća lake radojević 2012 or to produce electric power popovo polje buško blato lake milanović 2004 other poljes were modified by a drainage system to allow permanent irrigation and use of their arable land čepićko polje balbo et al 2006 only a few engineering studies were focused on limiting the impact of flooding they mostly consisted of cleaning and digging the surroundings of the ponor areas to enlarge them putick 1889 meze 1981 zupan hajna et al 2010 or to build an artificial evacuation tunnel at the polje rim to improve its drainage capacity fatničko polje milanović 2004 cerkniško polje mihevc et al 2010 unfortunately the enlargement of ponors successfully reduced the amplitude and duration of the highest floods only if the restrictions were located at the ponors zupan hajna et al 2010 moreover such projects were carried out at very few poljes and are currently not recommended as they treat the consequence the flood without any evaluation and understanding of the factors causing the flooding in addition this method can potentially affect irremediably the polje water balance and threaten its surrounding ecosystem which can lead to undesirable changes in its very sensitive ecological environment bonacci 2014 current characterization techniques assessing the hydrogeological behaviour of poljes are based on monitoring physico chemical parameters of the main springs and establishing relationships between precipitation spring and ponor discharge with floodwater notably bonacci 1987 lópez chicano et al 2002 and kovačič 2010 computed the water balance of several poljes using this method however these authors reported difficulties to accurately characterise all fluxes going through the polje during a flood on the one hand a quantification of the inflow is difficult as the rise of water in the aquifer discharging into the polje can activate many intermittent springs that are not taken into account in the polje water balance especially when the polje turns into a lake on the other hand a thorough characterization of the outflow is challenging as new ponors can activate with a rise of the flood level recently blatnik et al 2017 successfully addressed the problem of the outflow characterization they measured several adcp profiles along the river flowing across one polje during the late recession of a flood and innovatively combined them with data analysis of two gauging stations measuring the river s discharge upstream and downstream from the ponor zones these authors were able to assess the outflow capacity of several major ponors during the day of measurement they concluded that the measured total outflow of 18 m3 s was in agreement with the average discharge difference registered between the two gauging stations this improved consequently the assessment of the polje s water balance in another study kovačič and ravbar 2010 analysed the propagation of one flood of medium intensity through two inter connected poljes by combining stage and flood volume analyses with rainfall discharge cross correlations they figured out that water balance and data analyses are a meaningful basis to understand the flood propagation but that future works should be supported by additional methods able to consider the spatial and temporal frame of the floods in addition they mentioned the aquifer surrounding the polje as a factor potentially controlling the flood finally several studies carried out in ireland investigated the hydrogeological behaviour of turloughs naughton et al 2012 gill et al 2013a gill et al 2013b mccormack et al 2014 mccormack et al 2017 naughton et al 2017 these systems share some common features with poljes they are intermittently flooded and have a similar hydrogeological functioning however sheehy skeffington and scott 2008 reported notable difference between them turloughs are generally of smaller extension have a different geological genesis and flood for shorter periods and shallower depths finally as their in and outflow mostly depend from estavelles turloughs do not have a river permanently flowing on their bottoms among these studies gill et al 2013a mccormack et al 2014 and mccormack et al 2017 managed to model the flooding dynamics of two systems of several interconnected turloughs located in the irish lowland karst these authors combined a conduit flow model with chemical analyses and geophysical methods they reproduced the behaviour of both systems with an excellent fit and concluded that the approach could be transferred to larger systems like poljes therefore a spatial and temporal characterization of the polje hydrology together with its draining aquifer appears to be crucial to understand and predict its flooding behaviour under different hydrological situations this implies to identify the factors controlling flooding and to evaluate their impact on the flood amplitude and duration previous studies were solely based on water balance and data analyses i e lópez chicano et al 2002 kovačič 2010 kovačič and ravbar 2010 or were only attempting reproducing the dynamics of one particular field site without aiming to identify the main parameters controlling flooding and generalising their findings to other areas i e gill et al 2013a mccormack et al 2014 mccormack et al 2017 such aim agrees with the eu flood directive from 2007 directive 2007 60 ec that recommended explicitly to improve the general flood prognosis in europe in order to reduce the flood risks naughton et al 2012 major floods occurred frequently in the slovenian poljes during the last decade notably in 2010 2013 2014 and 2017 and raised high public interest on better understanding these systems they showed that present day knowledge is still insufficient regarding the impact of flooding on the polje surrounding environment the purpose of this paper is to improve the current understanding of flooding dynamics in poljes by clearly identifying the main parameters controlling flooding and evaluating their effect on the flood amplitude and duration after listing the parameters assumed to govern flooding two complementary simple numerical models are used to test their relevance then the findings are combined and applied to simulate a flood in a real polje results are compared with real data and the impact of each parameter is discussed this will allow assessing the importance of the aquifer draining the polje while such method had been widely employed in other fields of karst hydrology this is to our knowledge the first time that it will analyse polje flooding 2 methods 2 1 identifying the parameters controlling flooding the identification of the parameters assumed to control flooding in poljes derives from the equation describing the polje flooding dynamics as well as from a thorough review of the literature mentioned above and from the field experience of the authors based on simple water balance computations done by bonacci 1987 lópez chicano et al 2002 and kovačič 2010 the variation of lake stage in a polje is 1 h t a polje h q polje inflow q polje outflow with h the lake stage l a polje h the polje surface as a function of its depth l2 q polje inflow and q polje outflow the polje inflow and outflow l3t 1 this equation implies that flooding starts when q polje inflow q polje outflow in a similar way the water level begins to recede as soon as q polje inflow q polje outflow therefore several parameters affecting both rise and recession of the lake can be identified i the intensity and duration of the event recharging the polje kovačič and ravbar 2010 ii the number of recharge inputs providing inflow to the polje and their synchronous discharge kovačič and ravbar 2010 iii the elevation and drainage capacity of the ponors bonacci 2013 iv the transmissivity and storage capacity of the aquifer draining the polje gabrovšek and peric 2006 prelovšek et al 2008 v the presence of estavelles which contribute to both in and outflow albéric 2004 kovačič and habič 2005 sheehy skeffington and scott 2008 mccormack et al 2017 finally two supplementary parameters are in eq 1 and need to be tested vi the relationship between the polje surface area a polje h and its volume vii the initial water level in the polje if several parameters of this list seem to have an evident influence on the flood amplitude and duration the impact of some other is still uncertain at first glance the evaluation of their significance will remove any subjectivity and help to validate reject if they are determinant on controlling flooding especially a distinction between the parameters acting within the polje surface and those acting underground will be implemented 2 2 understand complex hydrological processes using simple numerical models simple numerical models are used to evaluate how the parameters listed previously might impact flooding this method was chosen because i they are physically based and spatially distributed even if some basic characteristics of flooding and recession can be solved with a simple set of equations and analytical solutions several of the parameters presented above require the use of more complex settings to be evaluated the physical and spatial frame offered by discretized modelling has the advantage to test concretely the response of various hydrological situations in both the polje and its surrounding aquifer that cannot be simply solved by analytical solutions ii they allow identifying and separating combined effects that are not easily distinguishable between each other in real hydrological time series because the user controls the value of each parameter put in the model such an evaluation becomes possible iii they are able to test and extrapolate how the flood responds to different configurations within the polje and its draining aquifer as data loggers are not necessary put at the optimal monitoring position modelling can provide valuable information to understand records of automatic measurements iv they can be coupled to any other system aquifer under a similar hydrological situation the versatility of the model allows that its results and findings might be transposed from its hypothetical setting to any real system to reach this goal two complementary numerical approaches are selected modflow nwt lake and storm water management model 2 2 1 modflow nwt lake modflow nwt lake combines a relatively recent release of the usgs finite difference program modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 with the lake package lak3 merritt and konikow 2000 the program follows the single continuum approach which attributes spatially hydraulic parameters on a mesh and computes the flow field using darcy s law modflow nwt is open source simple of use and accepted as standard tool among groundwater modellers the lake package was developed within cooperation between several water consortiums and the usgs to simulate interactions between surficial lakes and the underlying floridian karst aquifer the lake is defined as a reservoir that takes or releases water from the surrounding aquifer the lake stage volume and water balance are computed each time step and are coupled to the modflow water budget by a term called lake seepage several authors have used the lake package to study groundwater lake interactions reta 2011 taviani 2011 el zehairy 2014 while modflow has been frequently employed to investigate the hydrogeological behaviour of karst aquifers since the last 10 years e g worthington 2009 worthington et al 2012 mayaud et al 2014 mayaud et al 2016 this is to our knowledge the first time that this software is applied to poljes and focuses on lake flooding thus the idea of choosing modflow nwt lake is to test if the single continuum approach is able to simulate properly the most important characteristics of polje flooding dynamics despite its intrinsic limitations of not considering any conduit network and solely laminar flow in addition it would be worth to see if the flooding dynamics could be well approximated by considering only the parameters acting on the polje surface 2 2 2 storm water management model storm water management model swmm is a conduit model based on saint venant equations primarily developed to simulate the propagation of floods and wastewater events through sewage networks epa 2014 the approach has been widely used in karst sciences to model the hydraulics of caves systems peterson and wicks 2006 prelovšek et al 2008 covington et al 2009 kaufmann et al 2016 like modflow nwt swmm is open source and considered as a standard tool due to its thorough implementation of the hydraulic principles governing flow through pipe networks thus many complex settings that are not reproducible by modflow nwt lake can be easily implemented chen and goldscheider 2014 gabrovšek et al 2018 2 2 3 complementarities between both approaches the selected models are complementary modflow nwt lake considers exclusively the polje within its geomorphological borders whereas swmm is coupled to the aquifer draining the polje and can simulate an estavelle this important conceptual difference will contribute evaluating the impact of the parameters acting on the polje surface upon the parameters related to the aquifer draining the polje in addition it will show the advantages and limitations of each approach in terms of implementation effort and flow processes accuracy as turbulent flow has been identified to have a possible effect on groundwater flooding worthington and soley 2017 a comparison between modflow nwt lake and swmm will put in evidence if considering only laminar flow is a correct approximation when simulating flooding within the polje this will help to estimate which model is the most appropriate to be used under a given situation 3 numerical results from conceptual model of poljes 3 1 conceptual model a simple numerical model representing a conceptual polje is implemented fig 2 this conceptual model is purely fictive and has just vocation to represent a typical polje as frequently seen in the field the geometrical and hydrogeological configuration shown in fig 2 is chosen because i it allows testing all parameters described in the list ii its simplicity makes results easy to be interpreted iii it covers a combination of features that are present in a vast majority of poljes in the nature thus the number of springs ponors conduits storage chambers and estavelles fig 7 was decided arbitrarily this conceptual model can approximate the hydrogeological behaviour governing both border and structural poljes categories from ford and williams 2007 which are probably the most frequent poljes encountered worldwide similarly it would be as well valid to approximate the behaviour of a turlough despite that most of its in and outflow does not flow through estavelles the model is a rectangle of 2000 m long and 1500 m wide with a maximum flooded surface of 3 km2 delimited by a no flow boundary fig 2 its total thickness is 61 m with a depth of 40 m from the polje edge to its bottom which is taken as completely flat the elevation progressively increases like stairs towards the polje rims and allows a simultaneous increase of surface and volume during the flooding the main difference between modflow nwt lake and swmm is that the former considers only the polje from the spring to the ponors whereas the later encompasses the underground geometry i e the aquifer draining the polje and the estavelle fig 2a and fig 7 the areas upstream of the polje are not taken explicitly into account as it is assumed that their influence is visible on the shape of the recharge signal entering into the polje apart from the parameters being tested other hydraulic parameters are kept constant and described in the following paragraphs modflow nwt lake the model consists of two layers the upper one is defined as a no flow boundary and represent the intermittent lake the lower one represents the polje bottom and is defined as a groundwater body fig 2b a spring s is located in the bottom close to one border and provides allogenic recharge on the opposite edge five ponors p1 p2 p3 p4 and p5 are located at different altitudes with p1 being the lowest 21 m p2 and p3 at an intermediary elevation 31 m and p4 and p5 the highest 41 m as p1 is on the polje bottom it is assumed to permanently drain water high conductivity cells connect the spring to the ponors and mimic the behaviour of a river crossing hypothetically the polje surface the spring is represented by the well package wel harbaugh 2005 similarly the ponors are simulated using the drain package drn harbaugh 2005 a boundary condition allowing removing water from the model by applying the following equation 2 q out c d h h d i f h h d and 3 q out 0 i f h h d where q out is the flow from the aquifer into the drain l3t 1 cd is the drain conductance l2t 1 hd is the drain elevation l h is the head in the cell containing the drain l when the head is higher than the drain elevation water is removed from the model eq 2 conversely if the head drops below the drain elevation the drain stops removing water eq 3 in the standard model the drain conductance was fixed at 1 m2 s for each ponor which realistically corresponds to a hydraulic conductivity of 1 m s flowing through a cell cross section of 1 m2 eq 2 approximates well the behaviour of a ponor only under laminar flow conditions however a switch from laminar to turbulent flow at the ponor should not affect qualitatively any of the results swmm a storage unit with an identical volume surface area relationship than the modflow model represents the polje fig 2a conversely to the modflow nwt lake model where the spring is simulated by a point source input the recharge signal is applied on the whole surface the ponors are replaced by three conduits c1 c2 and c3 of identical diameter d 2 m they connect the polje to its outflowing adjacent aquifer at identical elevations as the ponors of the modflow model the conduits merge into a chamber ch that drains water towards an outfall o1 of diameter d1 6 m o1 collects the floodwater and removes it from the system in order not to duplicate the results tests for the flooding parameters present in the polje itself will be solely implemented with modflow nwt lake whereas swmm will investigate the impact of the aquifer draining the polje and the estavelle nevertheless the validity of both approaches will be tested by comparing the first flooding parameter with the two models the goal is to obtain results that are qualitatively and quantitatively comparable 3 2 recharge signal the influence of the recharge signal on the flood amplitude and duration is examined by comparing the polje response to five hypothetical floods all have the same peak flow value similar shape of rises and recessions and an identical baseflow fig 3 a they have been defined in order to test the reaction of the polje under peak hydrological scenarios with i a flood peak of high intensity and short duration 3 days of rise 3 days of recession and 3 days of high flow that should provoke a rapid filling and a reasonably short recession within the polje ii an event of long duration with a symmetrical linear rise and recession 14 days of rise 14 days of recession one day of high flow to see how a progressive variation of input affects the flooding iii a flood of high intensity and long duration 3 days of rise 3 days of recession and 23 days of high flow to investigate the polje response under a prolonged period of high waters iv two events with the same recharge volume but opposed rise and recession 3 days versus 14 days and 3 days of high flow to test the importance of the volume and duration of the rise upon its intensity results show the obvious influence of the recharge signal on the flood amplitude and duration fig 3b the flood will persist longer at high levels if the recharge event is important and long due to the high amount of water delivered for a longer time span as an example the event i reaches peak flow rapidly but its maximum flood level is the lowest due to the short duration of the recharge event and of the high flow period in opposite both events ii and iii produce floods of higher amplitude and longer duration because their recharge signal is longer this allows a bigger amount of water entering the polje when comparing the response of the events of opposed shape iv and iv bis these findings become more evident the notable difference in lake stage shows that the volume and duration of the rise of the recharge pulse is significant the polje receives about 35 more input water before the recharge signal reaches its peakflow during the event iv bis this proves that a recharge event of high intensity like iv will not necessary lead to the most severe flood and well agrees with the findings of ravbar et al 2018 these authors determined by data analysis that the strongest floods occurring in planinsko polje were not necessary triggered by the most intense recharge events thus the shape of the recharge signal entering the polje controls the flood amplitude and duration this proves that even if two recharge events might have identical peak flow values and volumes the maximum flood level will depend on the duration and volume of water released during the event rise visual comparison between modflow nwt lake and swmm shows that both models react qualitatively and quantitatively similarly to a variation of recharge signal fig 3b and table 1 the main observable differences are due to the conception of each model as swmm is a conduit model evident changes of slope can be directly identified as activation or deactivation of the different ponors which is not obvious with modflow nwt lake due to its continuum nature 3 3 number of recharge inputs the number of recharge inputs delivering water to the polje is assumed to influence the probability that a flood of high amplitude and long duration occurs to test this hypothesis the event iii of part 3 2 is applied to the modflow nwt lake model where a second spring s2 is added both springs release an event of similar shape with an equal maximum discharge of maxqiii 2 fig 4 a they are assumed to drain water coming from two separated recharge areas each of them being equal to half of the recharge area of the standard model the flood response is compared between the standard and modified models when both springs react simultaneously at their maximum discharge capacity then a simulation where s2 starts to discharge 14 days after s1 is investigated this extreme case could represent the delayed response of one recharge area due to some local factors such as snow retention different meteorological conditions or a change of transmissivity in the upper lying aquifer fig 4 shows logically that only the simulation where both springs discharge simultaneously at their maximum is able to reproduce the same flood as the standard model on the other hand the case where s2 starts to discharge 14 days after s1 is unable to reach the same maximum lake stage 2 13 m lower however the flood duration is longer at stages varying from 27 to 43 m above the polje s surface table 2 this signifies that the probability to have a severe flood decreases with the increase of recharge inputs supplying water to the polje as they all need to discharge simultaneously at their maximum capacity to reproduce the flood triggered by the standard model yet the flood might last longer at lower water levels especially if several recharge inputs are not discharging synchronously 3 4 ponors as ponors are the first object removing water out of the polje they are particularly important in regulating flooding their efficiency mostly depends on their drainage capacity that might vary temporarily due to flotsam and sediments as well as of their elevation numerical simulations evaluate these parameters by comparing i the standard model with a setting where the drain conductance of p1 is set to 3 m2 s another one where the drain conductance of p2 and p3 are equal to 0 5 m2 s p4 and p5 remain unchanged ii the standard model with a setting where p1 p2 and p3 are located on the polje bottom another one where p2 and p3 are located at the same altitude as p4 and p5 results in fig 5 a show the significance of the ponors drainage capacity the flood is longer and higher for the model where the drain conductance of p2 and p3 is lowered to 0 5 m2 s as the outflow through these ponors is reduced this facilitates the rise of the lake to higher stages and results in a smaller ponor outflow conversely the flood is shorter and less intense when the drain conductance of p1 is set to 3 m2 s as it considerably increases the outflow capacity of the polje at lower elevations this importantly affects the recession of the lake and reduces both flood amplitude and duration the importance of the ponor elevation in regulating flooding is visible in fig 5b the lake stage is lower for the model with three ponors located on the polje bottom as it allows more water to be drained out of the polje at low water levels conversely the flood is higher and longer for the model where four ponors are located at higher elevation this is because p1 is not sufficient to remove efficiently water at low elevations which leads to a consequent rise of lake stage 3 5 aquifer draining the polje similarly to the ponors the aquifer connected to the polje outflow zones should influence the flooding the aquifer transmissivity and storage capacity are assumed to regulate the flood amplitude and duration as well as the start of backflooding in the polje therefore the diameter of the chamber outlet d1 and the chamber volume ch are investigated fig 2a the event iii of 3 2 is applied to the swmm model and the polje responses are compared for the following situations i when d1 varies from d1 6 m to d1 1 m with ch constant to 107 m3 ii when ch changes by a factor of 10 from 106 to 109 m3 with d1 and the chamber height constant to 2 5 m and 100 m respectively fig 6 a shows the importance of d1 on the flood amplitude and duration significant flooding in both polje and chamber starts as soon as d1 is smaller than the total transmissivity of the conduits connecting the polje with the chamber the decrease of d1 produces an important head increase in the chamber this leads also to an important increase of stage in the polje as soon as the head in the chamber is higher than the polje bottom similar heads in both polje and chamber are observable for d1 1 5 m and d1 1 m as the conduit network is saturated with water due to backflooding which also strongly modifies the recession fig 6b shows the minimal impact of the chamber volume on the flood amplitude and duration an increase of ch from 106 to 109 m3 reduces the flood peak of only 4 81 m in the polje allowing reaching the stage of the standard model black curve in addition the baseflow in the polje is only slightly affected by a large increase of chamber volume while the head in the chamber is importantly modified under very large volumes the change of stage in the polje is minimal for the three first examples moreover as the biggest recorded underground chamber worldwide miao room barbary et al 1991 has a volume of 107 m3 most of the volumes presented in these examples are unrealistic more realistic large volumes range between 105 and 106 m3 which would not affect the flood peak in the present example 3 6 estavelles because estavelles behave like springs and ponors depending on the water level in the surrounding aquifer they must be investigated separately a supplementary reservoir able to release or drain water into the polje according to the hydrological situation is added to the swmm model fig 7 a this reservoir is connected to the polje via a junction j the event iii of 3 2 is applied at the same time on both polje and estavelle when i the elevation of j is 10 m lower than the polje bottom 11 m ii the elevation of j is 10 m higher than the polje bottom 31 m fig 7b shows that the flood amplitude increases importantly due to the estavelle contribution however the most interesting finding is observable at low flow conditions in the polje and depends on the junction elevation fig 7b and c when the junction is located below the polje bottom the polje becomes almost dry after 60 days even if a baseflow of about 3 m3 s is still recharging this amount of water flows in majority directly through the estavelle and is discharged at its outfall in opposite when the junction elevation is higher than the polje bottom the polje receives water from both karst spring and estavelle and is permanently flooded this is confirmed by the estavelle net water balance of both examples which is about four times higher toward the polje when j 31 m 60 3 103 m3 than when j 11 m 16 6 103 m3 thus the presence of an estavelle contributes to the flood amplitude and may considerably shorten or extend its duration depending on the elevation of its junction 3 7 surface area volume relationship the influence of the polje surface area volume relationship is tested by comparing the responses of the standard polje 3 km2 with a polje of larger surface 6 km2 and identical depth 41 m the three first recharge events of part 3 2 are applied to the modflow nwt lake model results in fig 8 and table 3 show that the surface size at the polje bottom considerably influence the flood amplitude whereas all floods in the standard polje reach a higher water level than in the larger polje the volume stored in the latter is logically more important due to its bigger storage capacity table 3 in addition the flood peak occurs later in the larger polje as it needs more time to be filled to reach a similar stage similarly the floods tend to stay longer at lower elevations fig 8b this is particularly visible for important flood events such as iii large as the lower head in the larger polje allows a slower drainage of the water through the ponors this result is in agreement with kovačič and ravbar 2010 who found out that larger poljes buffers waters for a longer time this limits the propagation of the floods in the downstream areas as the volume stored needs longer to be drained by the ponors 3 8 initial water level the effect of the initial water level in the polje is investigated the five events of part 3 2 are again applied to the modflow nwt lake model four initials hydrological situations are tested from a polje completely dry to a polje under 9 m 18 m and 27 m of water results in fig 9 show that a higher initial stage in the polje leads to an increase of the flood peak during the next event however the difference is more important for smaller events such as i whose flood peak change importantly between the two most extreme initial stages 86 77 table 4 compared to bigger events like iii which has an almost identical flood peak 2 38 table 4 in addition the flood peak tends to occur earlier for smallest events such as i ii and iv whereas it occurs at the same time for larger events like iii regardless of the initial water level in the polje table 4 this is because all ponors are already active at the event beginning hampering high initial stages to affect importantly the next event this finding is supported by the observation of the recession curves which vary consequently at earlier stages for i ii iv and iv bis but are identical for iii thus the initial water level in the polje mostly affect the flood amplitude and duration of the smallest events 4 modelling of a real polje planinsko polje in order to compare modflow nwt lake and swmm under a more complex hydrological situation a flood of medium amplitude and long duration occurring in a real polje is simulated planinsko polje slovenia is chosen as test site due to its large variety of hydrogeological and geomorphological processes which make it a typical example of structural polje kovačič and ravbar 2010 the aim is to construct two modflow nwt lake and swmm models based on current knowledge of the system and to see how they can reproduce the observed flooding dynamics during one event the fundamental difference of conception between both models will allow investigating the significance of a geometrical representation of the aquifer draining the polje the models aim to be interpretative anderson et al 2015 and are a simplification of the real conditions occurring in planinsko polje they have no purpose to identify accurately values of hydraulic parameters but just to reproduce the behaviour of the system in light of current hydrogeological knowledge of the area a comparison between

30 km south from ljubljana fig 10 this 10 km2 large polje is the lowest lying in a chain of poljes stretching along a major regional fault zone gospodarič and habič 1976 two permanent springs are found on its southern border and drain allogenic and autogenic water from three distinct recharge areas two large ponors zones are located on the polje northern and eastern sides and are connected to two partially explored cave systems cave register 2019 they drain water towards an important spring group located several kilometres northward finally a group of estavelles is found on the polje north western border the water is assumed to come from a separated recharge area located further nw and contribute to the polje flooding and recession blatnik 2019 the hydrological dynamic of the polje and its draining aquifer is measured at the river main gauging station as well as at three stations located in the nearby caves connected to the ponor zones and the estavelles fig 10 these stations are considered as representative observation points of the regional groundwater flow blatnik et al in press planinsko polje is flooded after each intense rainfall or snowmelt event occurring within its recharge area kovačič and ravbar 2010 the river begins to flow over its banks at the main gauging station when its discharge exceeds the maximum outflow capacity of the lowest located ponors which correspond to an amount of about 60 m3 s kovačič and ravbar 2010 the surrounding cave systems are inundated and behave like natural piezometers showing a maximum head difference up to 50 m turk 2010 the polje maximum outflow capacity can be divided between 40 m3 s and 60 m3 s for the northern ponors and 20 m3 s for the eastern ponors šušteršič 2002 the maximum in outflow of the estavelles was estimated to be 24 m3 s by putick 1889 however as the later value was never confirmed by any other measurement these data cannot be taken as reliable still it is assumed by speleological observations that the elevation of the junction estavelle polje is lower than the polje surface 4 2 numerical models 4 2 1 modflow nwt lake the modflow nwt lake model is presented in fig 11 a similar to the simple conceptual polje it takes only into account the basin going from the springs to the ponors the polje surface area volume relationship was defined according to the flooded areas and volumes recorded by frantar and ulaga 2015 as observed in planinsko polje two springs and two ponor zones are represented a higher drain conductance was given to the northern ponors in order to allow them to drain most of the water likewise the eastern ponors were located at a lower elevation in order to force them to permanently drain water the geometry of the aquifer draining the polje is lumped within the drain conductance of the ponors recharge data from a flood event that occurred in autumn 2017 are applied at both springs arso 2018b 4 2 2 swmm the swmm model is composed of planinsko polje and the three caves connected to the ponor zones and estavelles visible in fig 10 the model unifies together three conceptual hydrogeological models describing the behaviour of each outflow zone fig 11b that were implemented by blatnik et al in press the surface area volume relationship was defined according to the data recorded by frantar and ulaga 2015 other parameters such as conduit length and diameter cave volumes as well as ponors elevations are taken as close as possible to the reality according to data coming from speleological surveys cave register 2019 unexplored parts of the system such as the estavelles conduit network were extrapolated with realistic values the detailed dataset is shown in fig 11b and table 5 the event of autumn 2017 is applied on the polje surface by using discharge data recorded at the polje main gauging station arso 2018b a supplementary input time series based on the precipitation signal recorded around the area was generated for the estavelle group 4 3 results 4 3 1 modflow nwt lake results in fig 12 show that modflow nwt lake reproduces reasonably the main flooding dynamics of planinsko polje the fit was reached by adjusting the values of conductance at both ponor zones in order to get realistic lake stage and ponors outflow the value of nse at the main gauging station is of 0 74 which is acceptable for a single continuum model the northern ponors activate after several days whereas the eastern ponors drain permanently water out from the polje which somewhat confirms what is observed in the field the polje maximum outflow is 81 9 m3 s with a maximum outflow of 60 5 m3 s and 21 4 m3 s delivered to the northern and eastern ponors fig 12b these values are fairly similar to the values mentioned by šušteršič 2002 and partly measured by blatnik et al 2017 however the rise and recession of the modelled lake stage have a delay compared to the measured data which explains the nse value this is because modflow nwt lake simulates flow through groundwater porous bodies under laminar regime and is unable to consider any free surface turbulent flow that could mimic the behaviour of a river flowing through the polje 4 3 2 swmm fig 13 shows that swmm reproduces well the flooding dynamics of planinsko polje and its surrounding caves during the simulation a reasonable fit was obtained by adjusting the conduit diameters while the simulated stage of the polje shows also a delay compared to the observed data the main flood dynamics are better reproduced than with modflow nwt lake especially during the flood recession this is confirmed by a slightly higher value of nse 0 83 the modelled rise and recession of all caves are very similar to the recorded data with nse values of 0 91 for the cave 1 eastern ponors 0 89 for the cave 1 northern ponors and 0 84 for the cave linked to the estavelles the blue numbers visible on fig 13b and c indicate subsidiary events showing important water levels fluctuations in the caves that were not reproduced by the swmm model the most plausible explanation is that because these events were unable to flow over the banks of the river at the polje main gauging station their too low amplitude prevented swmm to reproduce them in both the polje and the caves to do so it would be necessary to take into account the exact volume of the riverbed as well as the surface volume relationship of the caves draining the polje as the later measurements are currently impossible to implement due to technical difficulties this will stay subject of future work similarly to modflow nwt lake the computed ponor outflow reaches a maximum value of 59 7 m3 s for the northern ponors and 17 5 m3 s for the eastern ponors the estavelle delivers a small in and outflow according to the position of its junction and its conduit diameter 5 discussion 5 1 parameters controlling flooding this section discusses how the flood amplitude and duration is affected by the parameters previously investigated the analyses allowed identifying particular situations that might promote flooding when i the polje is frequently subject to long recharge events that deliver an important volume of water during the event rise the meteorological conditions over the polje recharge area s as well as the capacity of the water to be rapidly transferred to the polje via a surface hydrographic network or through a cave system are the factors constraining the intensity and duration of the recharge ii the polje is recharged by one or by several recharge inputs that react simultaneously at their maximum discharge capacity if these recharge inputs are connected to separated recharge areas their simultaneous reaction at their maximum capacity will cause an extreme flood to occur conversely an unphased release of water by the different recharge inputs will reduce the probability of a severe flood event however it will increase the flood duration at lower elevations which can also affect the life of the inhabitants living in the polje vicinity a typical example is planinsko polje where extreme floods primarily result of a combination of high waters within the polje four recharge areas whereas an unphased recharge leads to long lasting floods at lower elevations kovačič and ravbar 2010 iii the polje has a poor outflow capacity at lower elevations this is caused by the absence or by an inefficient drainage from the lower ponor zones which will cause a frequent submersion of the polje lower parts for long periods iv the transmissivity of the aquifer draining the polje is too low to remove efficiently floodwater which causes an important and long backflooding therefore the value of the conduit diameter d1 is critical and should be absolutely investigated when doing modelling on a real field site as it might affect consequently both flood amplitude and duration conversely the storage capacity of the chamber ch is subsidiary and does not have a real effect on regulating flooding v the polje is connected to estavelles that have a junction located higher than the polje bottom the water balance of the estavelle will be positive towards the polje and will increase the flood amplitude and duration vi the polje has a small surface area this will promote floods at a high water level to occur especially if the outflow from the lower ponor zones is inefficient vii the initial water level in the polje is subsidiary and will contribute to increase the flood level for events of minor amplitude therefore severe flood events are prone to happen if one or more of the above conditions are met in addition it should be kept in mind that several of these parameters might change upon time for example the drainage capacity of the ponor zones and the aquifer transmissivity can be subject to temporal modifications that will impact the flood a higher flood event will be caused by the plugging of the ponor zones with tree branches such as in planinsko polje in february 2014 or by a sediment redeposition that will modify the transmissivity of the aquifer conduits mayaud et al 2016 conversely the flood amplitude and duration might be reduced by cleaning the ponor zones and their vicinity 5 2 comparison between modflow nwt lake and swmm numerical modelling with modflow nwt lake and swmm allows a comparison of both approaches while modflow nwt lake proved its usefulness to identify the parameters controlling flooding and evaluate their impact on the flood amplitude and duration the relatively acceptable fit obtained for planinsko polje should be taken cautiously the main reason is that the aquifer geometry is lumped into the ponors drain conductance this reduces the possibility to understand properly the flooding dynamics through the polje and its draining aquifer and prevents to gain valuable information on the aquifer geometry an evaluation on how the aquifer parameters might affect flooding is therefore not possible conversely swmm requires a higher design and calibration effort than modflow nwt lake but allows a better constraining of the model this is because the calibration relies on four observation points located in both the polje and its draining aquifer whereas the modflow model is calibrated using data of a single gauging station in addition swmm is more accurate than modflow nwt lake in terms of flow processes as it considers both conduit and turbulent flow even if the impact of the latter on the whole lake stage seems rather questionable due to the size of the lake it needs to be taken into account to reproduce properly the flow processes occurring downward the ponors by representing the aquifer geometry the swmm model contributes to improve the understanding of the flooding dynamics in planinsko polje all parameters that might influence flooding are considered within the model and can be evaluated upon each other therefore the use of a conduit based approach such as swmm is highly recommended as the aquifer draining the polje should be necessarily integrated in modelling attempts of real field cases still a single continuum model such as modflow nwt lake can be used under particular circumstances due to its easier implementation especially if the geometry of the draining aquifer is unknown or insignificant or if the polje is only sparsely monitored however it should only be viewed as a first attempt to roughly simulate the polje flooding dynamics finally it is worth adding that both models comport several uncertainties due to the complex nature of planinsko polje these uncertainties are related to the simplifications made by the conceptual model by the numerical limitations of each software as well as by the extrapolated parts of the models because of the absence of field data such is the case for the conduit network of the estavelles and its recharge event therefore both models need to be further tested and validated under other hydrological situations especially the swmm model could be refined by integrating other monitored caves located downward the caves presented in this example another improvement would be to consider the polje topography in order to better catch the propagation of smaller events through the polje and its surrounding caves such as the ones marked with blue arrows in fig 13 this would require a longer design and calibration effort but would reduce the uncertainties arising from the conceptual model as well as possible equifinality and non uniqueness problems that are recurrent to numerical modelling 6 conclusions this work represents an original contribution to understand the hydrological functioning of poljes the parameters assumed to control polje flooding were listed and tested using simple numerical models the impact of these parameters on the flood amplitude and duration was discussed and allowed to identify situations that can lead to severe flood events finally an application to a real polje was implemented using modflow nwt lake and swmm the results showed that even if modflow nwt lake might be used under particular circumstances the results produced limit the interpretation to what happen within the polje geomorphological borders which reduces considerably the understanding of the system the aquifer draining the polje should necessarily be taken into account to validate the conceptual hydrogeological model and properly understand the flooding dynamics therefore the use of an approach like swmm is highly recommended as it gives insights on the aquifer geometry and allows evaluating the impact of the aquifer parameters the method presented within this work is reproducible to other border and structural poljes and might also be applicable to turloughs and other karst areas encountering flooding moreover the results are found to have concrete applications simple and field site based numerical modelling can help selecting the best possible places to install a measurement network in non monitored poljes or improve the monitoring network of poljes already equipped in addition numerical modelling would be considerably useful to establish worst case flood scenarios specific to each polje as data from monitoring stations historical records of past floods and climate projections can be integrated within the model or used to interpret the results this would be very helpful for the people living around poljes especially if the frequency of extreme events is going to increase in the future as expected by current climate projections studies finally it should be emphasized that having two floods of similar amplitude and duration in a given polje do not guarantee that their parameters were identical during each event the flood should not be viewed as the consequence of a single parameter or an addition of several independent causes but as a complex parameter interaction that might evolve upon time this interaction should be investigated in details in future studies

6385,poljes are large flat closed depressions that can be found in most karst areas around the world they are prone to regular flooding which occurs after abundant rainfall or snowmelt events the floods can form several meters deep intermittent lakes that can persist for months human settlements around poljes have been traditionally positioned above the level of the most severe floods however many neighbouring villages expanded during the last decades to areas that might be endangered by large flood events in addition a recent study has shown that several poljes encountered floods of more severe amplitude in mid holocene due to a prevailing humid climate as current knowledge of polje s hydrology appears to be still insufficient further research is needed this work aims to identify the factors controlling polje flooding and evaluates their impact on the flood amplitude and duration to do so a list of parameters potentially controlling flooding is established the relevance of each parameter is tested by using two idealized numerical models the first one considers exclusively the polje from the springs to the ponors whereas the second integrates the aquifer adjacent to the polje outflow side first results show the usefulness of simple numerical models to identify the effect of each parameter on the flood amplitude and duration the findings are combined to simulate a flood of medium intensity and long duration that occurred on a typical polje a comparison of the results with real data demonstrates that the aquifer draining the polje needs to be considered to understand properly the flooding dynamics the approach presented within this work has the potential to be used in other poljes encountering similar hydrological situations but also lays foundation for flooding modelling in other karst areas keywords polje flood numerical modelling flooding parameters modflow nwt lake swmm 1 introduction karst terrains cover approximately 12 15 of the earth ice free surface and provide freshwater for about 20 25 of the world s population ford and williams 2007 chen et al 2017 despite a less dense surface hydrographic network compared to non karstic areas these regions are prone to an important flood risk parise 2015 floods in karst areas are considered as a disastrous natural hazard that can cause important economic damages and heavy human fatalities bonacci et al 2006 maréchal et al 2008 naughton et al 2017 the floods can be classified in three different categories i the flash flood which occurs shortly after very intense precipitations events on small catchments and concentrates the water in the lowlands of karst terrains bonacci et al 2006 maréchal et al 2008 de waele et al 2010 ii the intermittent flood that occurs regularly in karst enclosed basins such as poljes or turloughs kovačič and ravbar 2010 naughton et al 2012 and iii the groundwater type flood which is caused by a rise of the piezometric level above the ground surface pinault et al 2005 adams et al 2010 hughes et al 2011 ascott et al 2017 floods in poljes can be distinguished from other types of karst floods due to their high amplitude and long duration as well as because of their regularity kovačič and ravbar 2010 these flat closed depressions fig 1 are among the largest geomorphological features existing in karst landscapes with surfaces ranging from 0 5 km2 rašanjsko polje stumberger et al 2014 to more than 400 km2 livanjsko polje lučić 2014 they are found in most karst areas around the world with notable examples in dinaric karst planinsko cerkniško and popovo poljes among others china france spain or greece poljes are ecological areas of primary importance populated by an endemic fauna and flora sackl et al 2014 they have been used for extensive agriculture due to their rich soil cover compared to the surrounding rocky karst landscapes and undergo a larger population pressure than the rest of the karst regions lópez chicano et al 2002 water enters poljes through the springs located at their rims and sinks through ponors which are generally located on the polje borders in addition poljes can be fed drained through estavelles which act as springs or ponors depending on the head in the surrounding aquifer albéric 2004 from a hydrogeological point of view a polje is an integral part of the karst aquifer that provides its recharge and drains its outflow it can be considered as a natural surface reservoir that buffers floodwater gams 1978 ford and williams 2007 bonacci 2013 human settlements have been traditionally positioned above the level of the most severe floods however many towns expanded during the last decades to areas endangered by large flood events as an example floods of february 2014 in planinsko polje slovenia were the highest in the last 80 years and created an over 10 3 km2 large intermittent lake the maximum water level recorded at the gauging station was of 8 26 m with a volume of 73 million m3 frantar and ulaga 2015 the lake remained for almost two months and flooded over 40 houses and other facilities in two villages causing important economic damages in a broader view 37 of the 57 poljes of bosnia and herzegovina are prone to regular flood events sackl et al 2014 summing up to an overall area of 802 6 km2 for potential flooding in this country moreover a recent sediment analysis in several caves terraces and pocket valleys from southwest slovenia stepišnik et al 2012 ferk 2016 showed that extreme floods may have occurred during mid holocene 8000 5500 y bp in planinsko and cerkniško poljes due to a more humid climate benito et al 2015 these floods are assumed to have reached almost 50 m above the poljes surface and should have lasted much longer than current extreme events this demonstrates that floods in poljes are a potential threat due to changing climatic conditions especially if extreme events should happen more frequently in the future ribes et al 2018 up to now most hydrogeological studies dedicated to poljes were done for engineering purposes milanović 2004 several poljes were changed to permanent reservoirs by building a dam in order to use their storage capacity for drinking water bileća lake radojević 2012 or to produce electric power popovo polje buško blato lake milanović 2004 other poljes were modified by a drainage system to allow permanent irrigation and use of their arable land čepićko polje balbo et al 2006 only a few engineering studies were focused on limiting the impact of flooding they mostly consisted of cleaning and digging the surroundings of the ponor areas to enlarge them putick 1889 meze 1981 zupan hajna et al 2010 or to build an artificial evacuation tunnel at the polje rim to improve its drainage capacity fatničko polje milanović 2004 cerkniško polje mihevc et al 2010 unfortunately the enlargement of ponors successfully reduced the amplitude and duration of the highest floods only if the restrictions were located at the ponors zupan hajna et al 2010 moreover such projects were carried out at very few poljes and are currently not recommended as they treat the consequence the flood without any evaluation and understanding of the factors causing the flooding in addition this method can potentially affect irremediably the polje water balance and threaten its surrounding ecosystem which can lead to undesirable changes in its very sensitive ecological environment bonacci 2014 current characterization techniques assessing the hydrogeological behaviour of poljes are based on monitoring physico chemical parameters of the main springs and establishing relationships between precipitation spring and ponor discharge with floodwater notably bonacci 1987 lópez chicano et al 2002 and kovačič 2010 computed the water balance of several poljes using this method however these authors reported difficulties to accurately characterise all fluxes going through the polje during a flood on the one hand a quantification of the inflow is difficult as the rise of water in the aquifer discharging into the polje can activate many intermittent springs that are not taken into account in the polje water balance especially when the polje turns into a lake on the other hand a thorough characterization of the outflow is challenging as new ponors can activate with a rise of the flood level recently blatnik et al 2017 successfully addressed the problem of the outflow characterization they measured several adcp profiles along the river flowing across one polje during the late recession of a flood and innovatively combined them with data analysis of two gauging stations measuring the river s discharge upstream and downstream from the ponor zones these authors were able to assess the outflow capacity of several major ponors during the day of measurement they concluded that the measured total outflow of 18 m3 s was in agreement with the average discharge difference registered between the two gauging stations this improved consequently the assessment of the polje s water balance in another study kovačič and ravbar 2010 analysed the propagation of one flood of medium intensity through two inter connected poljes by combining stage and flood volume analyses with rainfall discharge cross correlations they figured out that water balance and data analyses are a meaningful basis to understand the flood propagation but that future works should be supported by additional methods able to consider the spatial and temporal frame of the floods in addition they mentioned the aquifer surrounding the polje as a factor potentially controlling the flood finally several studies carried out in ireland investigated the hydrogeological behaviour of turloughs naughton et al 2012 gill et al 2013a gill et al 2013b mccormack et al 2014 mccormack et al 2017 naughton et al 2017 these systems share some common features with poljes they are intermittently flooded and have a similar hydrogeological functioning however sheehy skeffington and scott 2008 reported notable difference between them turloughs are generally of smaller extension have a different geological genesis and flood for shorter periods and shallower depths finally as their in and outflow mostly depend from estavelles turloughs do not have a river permanently flowing on their bottoms among these studies gill et al 2013a mccormack et al 2014 and mccormack et al 2017 managed to model the flooding dynamics of two systems of several interconnected turloughs located in the irish lowland karst these authors combined a conduit flow model with chemical analyses and geophysical methods they reproduced the behaviour of both systems with an excellent fit and concluded that the approach could be transferred to larger systems like poljes therefore a spatial and temporal characterization of the polje hydrology together with its draining aquifer appears to be crucial to understand and predict its flooding behaviour under different hydrological situations this implies to identify the factors controlling flooding and to evaluate their impact on the flood amplitude and duration previous studies were solely based on water balance and data analyses i e lópez chicano et al 2002 kovačič 2010 kovačič and ravbar 2010 or were only attempting reproducing the dynamics of one particular field site without aiming to identify the main parameters controlling flooding and generalising their findings to other areas i e gill et al 2013a mccormack et al 2014 mccormack et al 2017 such aim agrees with the eu flood directive from 2007 directive 2007 60 ec that recommended explicitly to improve the general flood prognosis in europe in order to reduce the flood risks naughton et al 2012 major floods occurred frequently in the slovenian poljes during the last decade notably in 2010 2013 2014 and 2017 and raised high public interest on better understanding these systems they showed that present day knowledge is still insufficient regarding the impact of flooding on the polje surrounding environment the purpose of this paper is to improve the current understanding of flooding dynamics in poljes by clearly identifying the main parameters controlling flooding and evaluating their effect on the flood amplitude and duration after listing the parameters assumed to govern flooding two complementary simple numerical models are used to test their relevance then the findings are combined and applied to simulate a flood in a real polje results are compared with real data and the impact of each parameter is discussed this will allow assessing the importance of the aquifer draining the polje while such method had been widely employed in other fields of karst hydrology this is to our knowledge the first time that it will analyse polje flooding 2 methods 2 1 identifying the parameters controlling flooding the identification of the parameters assumed to control flooding in poljes derives from the equation describing the polje flooding dynamics as well as from a thorough review of the literature mentioned above and from the field experience of the authors based on simple water balance computations done by bonacci 1987 lópez chicano et al 2002 and kovačič 2010 the variation of lake stage in a polje is 1 h t a polje h q polje inflow q polje outflow with h the lake stage l a polje h the polje surface as a function of its depth l2 q polje inflow and q polje outflow the polje inflow and outflow l3t 1 this equation implies that flooding starts when q polje inflow q polje outflow in a similar way the water level begins to recede as soon as q polje inflow q polje outflow therefore several parameters affecting both rise and recession of the lake can be identified i the intensity and duration of the event recharging the polje kovačič and ravbar 2010 ii the number of recharge inputs providing inflow to the polje and their synchronous discharge kovačič and ravbar 2010 iii the elevation and drainage capacity of the ponors bonacci 2013 iv the transmissivity and storage capacity of the aquifer draining the polje gabrovšek and peric 2006 prelovšek et al 2008 v the presence of estavelles which contribute to both in and outflow albéric 2004 kovačič and habič 2005 sheehy skeffington and scott 2008 mccormack et al 2017 finally two supplementary parameters are in eq 1 and need to be tested vi the relationship between the polje surface area a polje h and its volume vii the initial water level in the polje if several parameters of this list seem to have an evident influence on the flood amplitude and duration the impact of some other is still uncertain at first glance the evaluation of their significance will remove any subjectivity and help to validate reject if they are determinant on controlling flooding especially a distinction between the parameters acting within the polje surface and those acting underground will be implemented 2 2 understand complex hydrological processes using simple numerical models simple numerical models are used to evaluate how the parameters listed previously might impact flooding this method was chosen because i they are physically based and spatially distributed even if some basic characteristics of flooding and recession can be solved with a simple set of equations and analytical solutions several of the parameters presented above require the use of more complex settings to be evaluated the physical and spatial frame offered by discretized modelling has the advantage to test concretely the response of various hydrological situations in both the polje and its surrounding aquifer that cannot be simply solved by analytical solutions ii they allow identifying and separating combined effects that are not easily distinguishable between each other in real hydrological time series because the user controls the value of each parameter put in the model such an evaluation becomes possible iii they are able to test and extrapolate how the flood responds to different configurations within the polje and its draining aquifer as data loggers are not necessary put at the optimal monitoring position modelling can provide valuable information to understand records of automatic measurements iv they can be coupled to any other system aquifer under a similar hydrological situation the versatility of the model allows that its results and findings might be transposed from its hypothetical setting to any real system to reach this goal two complementary numerical approaches are selected modflow nwt lake and storm water management model 2 2 1 modflow nwt lake modflow nwt lake combines a relatively recent release of the usgs finite difference program modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 with the lake package lak3 merritt and konikow 2000 the program follows the single continuum approach which attributes spatially hydraulic parameters on a mesh and computes the flow field using darcy s law modflow nwt is open source simple of use and accepted as standard tool among groundwater modellers the lake package was developed within cooperation between several water consortiums and the usgs to simulate interactions between surficial lakes and the underlying floridian karst aquifer the lake is defined as a reservoir that takes or releases water from the surrounding aquifer the lake stage volume and water balance are computed each time step and are coupled to the modflow water budget by a term called lake seepage several authors have used the lake package to study groundwater lake interactions reta 2011 taviani 2011 el zehairy 2014 while modflow has been frequently employed to investigate the hydrogeological behaviour of karst aquifers since the last 10 years e g worthington 2009 worthington et al 2012 mayaud et al 2014 mayaud et al 2016 this is to our knowledge the first time that this software is applied to poljes and focuses on lake flooding thus the idea of choosing modflow nwt lake is to test if the single continuum approach is able to simulate properly the most important characteristics of polje flooding dynamics despite its intrinsic limitations of not considering any conduit network and solely laminar flow in addition it would be worth to see if the flooding dynamics could be well approximated by considering only the parameters acting on the polje surface 2 2 2 storm water management model storm water management model swmm is a conduit model based on saint venant equations primarily developed to simulate the propagation of floods and wastewater events through sewage networks epa 2014 the approach has been widely used in karst sciences to model the hydraulics of caves systems peterson and wicks 2006 prelovšek et al 2008 covington et al 2009 kaufmann et al 2016 like modflow nwt swmm is open source and considered as a standard tool due to its thorough implementation of the hydraulic principles governing flow through pipe networks thus many complex settings that are not reproducible by modflow nwt lake can be easily implemented chen and goldscheider 2014 gabrovšek et al 2018 2 2 3 complementarities between both approaches the selected models are complementary modflow nwt lake considers exclusively the polje within its geomorphological borders whereas swmm is coupled to the aquifer draining the polje and can simulate an estavelle this important conceptual difference will contribute evaluating the impact of the parameters acting on the polje surface upon the parameters related to the aquifer draining the polje in addition it will show the advantages and limitations of each approach in terms of implementation effort and flow processes accuracy as turbulent flow has been identified to have a possible effect on groundwater flooding worthington and soley 2017 a comparison between modflow nwt lake and swmm will put in evidence if considering only laminar flow is a correct approximation when simulating flooding within the polje this will help to estimate which model is the most appropriate to be used under a given situation 3 numerical results from conceptual model of poljes 3 1 conceptual model a simple numerical model representing a conceptual polje is implemented fig 2 this conceptual model is purely fictive and has just vocation to represent a typical polje as frequently seen in the field the geometrical and hydrogeological configuration shown in fig 2 is chosen because i it allows testing all parameters described in the list ii its simplicity makes results easy to be interpreted iii it covers a combination of features that are present in a vast majority of poljes in the nature thus the number of springs ponors conduits storage chambers and estavelles fig 7 was decided arbitrarily this conceptual model can approximate the hydrogeological behaviour governing both border and structural poljes categories from ford and williams 2007 which are probably the most frequent poljes encountered worldwide similarly it would be as well valid to approximate the behaviour of a turlough despite that most of its in and outflow does not flow through estavelles the model is a rectangle of 2000 m long and 1500 m wide with a maximum flooded surface of 3 km2 delimited by a no flow boundary fig 2 its total thickness is 61 m with a depth of 40 m from the polje edge to its bottom which is taken as completely flat the elevation progressively increases like stairs towards the polje rims and allows a simultaneous increase of surface and volume during the flooding the main difference between modflow nwt lake and swmm is that the former considers only the polje from the spring to the ponors whereas the later encompasses the underground geometry i e the aquifer draining the polje and the estavelle fig 2a and fig 7 the areas upstream of the polje are not taken explicitly into account as it is assumed that their influence is visible on the shape of the recharge signal entering into the polje apart from the parameters being tested other hydraulic parameters are kept constant and described in the following paragraphs modflow nwt lake the model consists of two layers the upper one is defined as a no flow boundary and represent the intermittent lake the lower one represents the polje bottom and is defined as a groundwater body fig 2b a spring s is located in the bottom close to one border and provides allogenic recharge on the opposite edge five ponors p1 p2 p3 p4 and p5 are located at different altitudes with p1 being the lowest 21 m p2 and p3 at an intermediary elevation 31 m and p4 and p5 the highest 41 m as p1 is on the polje bottom it is assumed to permanently drain water high conductivity cells connect the spring to the ponors and mimic the behaviour of a river crossing hypothetically the polje surface the spring is represented by the well package wel harbaugh 2005 similarly the ponors are simulated using the drain package drn harbaugh 2005 a boundary condition allowing removing water from the model by applying the following equation 2 q out c d h h d i f h h d and 3 q out 0 i f h h d where q out is the flow from the aquifer into the drain l3t 1 cd is the drain conductance l2t 1 hd is the drain elevation l h is the head in the cell containing the drain l when the head is higher than the drain elevation water is removed from the model eq 2 conversely if the head drops below the drain elevation the drain stops removing water eq 3 in the standard model the drain conductance was fixed at 1 m2 s for each ponor which realistically corresponds to a hydraulic conductivity of 1 m s flowing through a cell cross section of 1 m2 eq 2 approximates well the behaviour of a ponor only under laminar flow conditions however a switch from laminar to turbulent flow at the ponor should not affect qualitatively any of the results swmm a storage unit with an identical volume surface area relationship than the modflow model represents the polje fig 2a conversely to the modflow nwt lake model where the spring is simulated by a point source input the recharge signal is applied on the whole surface the ponors are replaced by three conduits c1 c2 and c3 of identical diameter d 2 m they connect the polje to its outflowing adjacent aquifer at identical elevations as the ponors of the modflow model the conduits merge into a chamber ch that drains water towards an outfall o1 of diameter d1 6 m o1 collects the floodwater and removes it from the system in order not to duplicate the results tests for the flooding parameters present in the polje itself will be solely implemented with modflow nwt lake whereas swmm will investigate the impact of the aquifer draining the polje and the estavelle nevertheless the validity of both approaches will be tested by comparing the first flooding parameter with the two models the goal is to obtain results that are qualitatively and quantitatively comparable 3 2 recharge signal the influence of the recharge signal on the flood amplitude and duration is examined by comparing the polje response to five hypothetical floods all have the same peak flow value similar shape of rises and recessions and an identical baseflow fig 3 a they have been defined in order to test the reaction of the polje under peak hydrological scenarios with i a flood peak of high intensity and short duration 3 days of rise 3 days of recession and 3 days of high flow that should provoke a rapid filling and a reasonably short recession within the polje ii an event of long duration with a symmetrical linear rise and recession 14 days of rise 14 days of recession one day of high flow to see how a progressive variation of input affects the flooding iii a flood of high intensity and long duration 3 days of rise 3 days of recession and 23 days of high flow to investigate the polje response under a prolonged period of high waters iv two events with the same recharge volume but opposed rise and recession 3 days versus 14 days and 3 days of high flow to test the importance of the volume and duration of the rise upon its intensity results show the obvious influence of the recharge signal on the flood amplitude and duration fig 3b the flood will persist longer at high levels if the recharge event is important and long due to the high amount of water delivered for a longer time span as an example the event i reaches peak flow rapidly but its maximum flood level is the lowest due to the short duration of the recharge event and of the high flow period in opposite both events ii and iii produce floods of higher amplitude and longer duration because their recharge signal is longer this allows a bigger amount of water entering the polje when comparing the response of the events of opposed shape iv and iv bis these findings become more evident the notable difference in lake stage shows that the volume and duration of the rise of the recharge pulse is significant the polje receives about 35 more input water before the recharge signal reaches its peakflow during the event iv bis this proves that a recharge event of high intensity like iv will not necessary lead to the most severe flood and well agrees with the findings of ravbar et al 2018 these authors determined by data analysis that the strongest floods occurring in planinsko polje were not necessary triggered by the most intense recharge events thus the shape of the recharge signal entering the polje controls the flood amplitude and duration this proves that even if two recharge events might have identical peak flow values and volumes the maximum flood level will depend on the duration and volume of water released during the event rise visual comparison between modflow nwt lake and swmm shows that both models react qualitatively and quantitatively similarly to a variation of recharge signal fig 3b and table 1 the main observable differences are due to the conception of each model as swmm is a conduit model evident changes of slope can be directly identified as activation or deactivation of the different ponors which is not obvious with modflow nwt lake due to its continuum nature 3 3 number of recharge inputs the number of recharge inputs delivering water to the polje is assumed to influence the probability that a flood of high amplitude and long duration occurs to test this hypothesis the event iii of part 3 2 is applied to the modflow nwt lake model where a second spring s2 is added both springs release an event of similar shape with an equal maximum discharge of maxqiii 2 fig 4 a they are assumed to drain water coming from two separated recharge areas each of them being equal to half of the recharge area of the standard model the flood response is compared between the standard and modified models when both springs react simultaneously at their maximum discharge capacity then a simulation where s2 starts to discharge 14 days after s1 is investigated this extreme case could represent the delayed response of one recharge area due to some local factors such as snow retention different meteorological conditions or a change of transmissivity in the upper lying aquifer fig 4 shows logically that only the simulation where both springs discharge simultaneously at their maximum is able to reproduce the same flood as the standard model on the other hand the case where s2 starts to discharge 14 days after s1 is unable to reach the same maximum lake stage 2 13 m lower however the flood duration is longer at stages varying from 27 to 43 m above the polje s surface table 2 this signifies that the probability to have a severe flood decreases with the increase of recharge inputs supplying water to the polje as they all need to discharge simultaneously at their maximum capacity to reproduce the flood triggered by the standard model yet the flood might last longer at lower water levels especially if several recharge inputs are not discharging synchronously 3 4 ponors as ponors are the first object removing water out of the polje they are particularly important in regulating flooding their efficiency mostly depends on their drainage capacity that might vary temporarily due to flotsam and sediments as well as of their elevation numerical simulations evaluate these parameters by comparing i the standard model with a setting where the drain conductance of p1 is set to 3 m2 s another one where the drain conductance of p2 and p3 are equal to 0 5 m2 s p4 and p5 remain unchanged ii the standard model with a setting where p1 p2 and p3 are located on the polje bottom another one where p2 and p3 are located at the same altitude as p4 and p5 results in fig 5 a show the significance of the ponors drainage capacity the flood is longer and higher for the model where the drain conductance of p2 and p3 is lowered to 0 5 m2 s as the outflow through these ponors is reduced this facilitates the rise of the lake to higher stages and results in a smaller ponor outflow conversely the flood is shorter and less intense when the drain conductance of p1 is set to 3 m2 s as it considerably increases the outflow capacity of the polje at lower elevations this importantly affects the recession of the lake and reduces both flood amplitude and duration the importance of the ponor elevation in regulating flooding is visible in fig 5b the lake stage is lower for the model with three ponors located on the polje bottom as it allows more water to be drained out of the polje at low water levels conversely the flood is higher and longer for the model where four ponors are located at higher elevation this is because p1 is not sufficient to remove efficiently water at low elevations which leads to a consequent rise of lake stage 3 5 aquifer draining the polje similarly to the ponors the aquifer connected to the polje outflow zones should influence the flooding the aquifer transmissivity and storage capacity are assumed to regulate the flood amplitude and duration as well as the start of backflooding in the polje therefore the diameter of the chamber outlet d1 and the chamber volume ch are investigated fig 2a the event iii of 3 2 is applied to the swmm model and the polje responses are compared for the following situations i when d1 varies from d1 6 m to d1 1 m with ch constant to 107 m3 ii when ch changes by a factor of 10 from 106 to 109 m3 with d1 and the chamber height constant to 2 5 m and 100 m respectively fig 6 a shows the importance of d1 on the flood amplitude and duration significant flooding in both polje and chamber starts as soon as d1 is smaller than the total transmissivity of the conduits connecting the polje with the chamber the decrease of d1 produces an important head increase in the chamber this leads also to an important increase of stage in the polje as soon as the head in the chamber is higher than the polje bottom similar heads in both polje and chamber are observable for d1 1 5 m and d1 1 m as the conduit network is saturated with water due to backflooding which also strongly modifies the recession fig 6b shows the minimal impact of the chamber volume on the flood amplitude and duration an increase of ch from 106 to 109 m3 reduces the flood peak of only 4 81 m in the polje allowing reaching the stage of the standard model black curve in addition the baseflow in the polje is only slightly affected by a large increase of chamber volume while the head in the chamber is importantly modified under very large volumes the change of stage in the polje is minimal for the three first examples moreover as the biggest recorded underground chamber worldwide miao room barbary et al 1991 has a volume of 107 m3 most of the volumes presented in these examples are unrealistic more realistic large volumes range between 105 and 106 m3 which would not affect the flood peak in the present example 3 6 estavelles because estavelles behave like springs and ponors depending on the water level in the surrounding aquifer they must be investigated separately a supplementary reservoir able to release or drain water into the polje according to the hydrological situation is added to the swmm model fig 7 a this reservoir is connected to the polje via a junction j the event iii of 3 2 is applied at the same time on both polje and estavelle when i the elevation of j is 10 m lower than the polje bottom 11 m ii the elevation of j is 10 m higher than the polje bottom 31 m fig 7b shows that the flood amplitude increases importantly due to the estavelle contribution however the most interesting finding is observable at low flow conditions in the polje and depends on the junction elevation fig 7b and c when the junction is located below the polje bottom the polje becomes almost dry after 60 days even if a baseflow of about 3 m3 s is still recharging this amount of water flows in majority directly through the estavelle and is discharged at its outfall in opposite when the junction elevation is higher than the polje bottom the polje receives water from both karst spring and estavelle and is permanently flooded this is confirmed by the estavelle net water balance of both examples which is about four times higher toward the polje when j 31 m 60 3 103 m3 than when j 11 m 16 6 103 m3 thus the presence of an estavelle contributes to the flood amplitude and may considerably shorten or extend its duration depending on the elevation of its junction 3 7 surface area volume relationship the influence of the polje surface area volume relationship is tested by comparing the responses of the standard polje 3 km2 with a polje of larger surface 6 km2 and identical depth 41 m the three first recharge events of part 3 2 are applied to the modflow nwt lake model results in fig 8 and table 3 show that the surface size at the polje bottom considerably influence the flood amplitude whereas all floods in the standard polje reach a higher water level than in the larger polje the volume stored in the latter is logically more important due to its bigger storage capacity table 3 in addition the flood peak occurs later in the larger polje as it needs more time to be filled to reach a similar stage similarly the floods tend to stay longer at lower elevations fig 8b this is particularly visible for important flood events such as iii large as the lower head in the larger polje allows a slower drainage of the water through the ponors this result is in agreement with kovačič and ravbar 2010 who found out that larger poljes buffers waters for a longer time this limits the propagation of the floods in the downstream areas as the volume stored needs longer to be drained by the ponors 3 8 initial water level the effect of the initial water level in the polje is investigated the five events of part 3 2 are again applied to the modflow nwt lake model four initials hydrological situations are tested from a polje completely dry to a polje under 9 m 18 m and 27 m of water results in fig 9 show that a higher initial stage in the polje leads to an increase of the flood peak during the next event however the difference is more important for smaller events such as i whose flood peak change importantly between the two most extreme initial stages 86 77 table 4 compared to bigger events like iii which has an almost identical flood peak 2 38 table 4 in addition the flood peak tends to occur earlier for smallest events such as i ii and iv whereas it occurs at the same time for larger events like iii regardless of the initial water level in the polje table 4 this is because all ponors are already active at the event beginning hampering high initial stages to affect importantly the next event this finding is supported by the observation of the recession curves which vary consequently at earlier stages for i ii iv and iv bis but are identical for iii thus the initial water level in the polje mostly affect the flood amplitude and duration of the smallest events 4 modelling of a real polje planinsko polje in order to compare modflow nwt lake and swmm under a more complex hydrological situation a flood of medium amplitude and long duration occurring in a real polje is simulated planinsko polje slovenia is chosen as test site due to its large variety of hydrogeological and geomorphological processes which make it a typical example of structural polje kovačič and ravbar 2010 the aim is to construct two modflow nwt lake and swmm models based on current knowledge of the system and to see how they can reproduce the observed flooding dynamics during one event the fundamental difference of conception between both models will allow investigating the significance of a geometrical representation of the aquifer draining the polje the models aim to be interpretative anderson et al 2015 and are a simplification of the real conditions occurring in planinsko polje they have no purpose to identify accurately values of hydraulic parameters but just to reproduce the behaviour of the system in light of current hydrogeological knowledge of the area a comparison between models results and observed data is implemented using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 4 n s e 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 with o i the observed data p i the modelled ones and o the mean of the observed values within a range of size n 4 1 hydrology and flood behaviour of planinsko polje planinsko polje is located in the northern part of the slovenian dinaric karst about 30 km south from ljubljana fig 10 this 10 km2 large polje is the lowest lying in a chain of poljes stretching along a major regional fault zone gospodarič and habič 1976 two permanent springs are found on its southern border and drain allogenic and autogenic water from three distinct recharge areas two large ponors zones are located on the polje northern and eastern sides and are connected to two partially explored cave systems cave register 2019 they drain water towards an important spring group located several kilometres northward finally a group of estavelles is found on the polje north western border the water is assumed to come from a separated recharge area located further nw and contribute to the polje flooding and recession blatnik 2019 the hydrological dynamic of the polje and its draining aquifer is measured at the river main gauging station as well as at three stations located in the nearby caves connected to the ponor zones and the estavelles fig 10 these stations are considered as representative observation points of the regional groundwater flow blatnik et al in press planinsko polje is flooded after each intense rainfall or snowmelt event occurring within its recharge area kovačič and ravbar 2010 the river begins to flow over its banks at the main gauging station when its discharge exceeds the maximum outflow capacity of the lowest located ponors which correspond to an amount of about 60 m3 s kovačič and ravbar 2010 the surrounding cave systems are inundated and behave like natural piezometers showing a maximum head difference up to 50 m turk 2010 the polje maximum outflow capacity can be divided between 40 m3 s and 60 m3 s for the northern ponors and 20 m3 s for the eastern ponors šušteršič 2002 the maximum in outflow of the estavelles was estimated to be 24 m3 s by putick 1889 however as the later value was never confirmed by any other measurement these data cannot be taken as reliable still it is assumed by speleological observations that the elevation of the junction estavelle polje is lower than the polje surface 4 2 numerical models 4 2 1 modflow nwt lake the modflow nwt lake model is presented in fig 11 a similar to the simple conceptual polje it takes only into account the basin going from the springs to the ponors the polje surface area volume relationship was defined according to the flooded areas and volumes recorded by frantar and ulaga 2015 as observed in planinsko polje two springs and two ponor zones are represented a higher drain conductance was given to the northern ponors in order to allow them to drain most of the water likewise the eastern ponors were located at a lower elevation in order to force them to permanently drain water the geometry of the aquifer draining the polje is lumped within the drain conductance of the ponors recharge data from a flood event that occurred in autumn 2017 are applied at both springs arso 2018b 4 2 2 swmm the swmm model is composed of planinsko polje and the three caves connected to the ponor zones and estavelles visible in fig 10 the model unifies together three conceptual hydrogeological models describing the behaviour of each outflow zone fig 11b that were implemented by blatnik et al in press the surface area volume relationship was defined according to the data recorded by frantar and ulaga 2015 other parameters such as conduit length and diameter cave volumes as well as ponors elevations are taken as close as possible to the reality according to data coming from speleological surveys cave register 2019 unexplored parts of the system such as the estavelles conduit network were extrapolated with realistic values the detailed dataset is shown in fig 11b and table 5 the event of autumn 2017 is applied on the polje surface by using discharge data recorded at the polje main gauging station arso 2018b a supplementary input time series based on the precipitation signal recorded around the area was generated for the estavelle group 4 3 results 4 3 1 modflow nwt lake results in fig 12 show that modflow nwt lake reproduces reasonably the main flooding dynamics of planinsko polje the fit was reached by adjusting the values of conductance at both ponor zones in order to get realistic lake stage and ponors outflow the value of nse at the main gauging station is of 0 74 which is acceptable for a single continuum model the northern ponors activate after several days whereas the eastern ponors drain permanently water out from the polje which somewhat confirms what is observed in the field the polje maximum outflow is 81 9 m3 s with a maximum outflow of 60 5 m3 s and 21 4 m3 s delivered to the northern and eastern ponors fig 12b these values are fairly similar to the values mentioned by šušteršič 2002 and partly measured by blatnik et al 2017 however the rise and recession of the modelled lake stage have a delay compared to the measured data which explains the nse value this is because modflow nwt lake simulates flow through groundwater porous bodies under laminar regime and is unable to consider any free surface turbulent flow that could mimic the behaviour of a river flowing through the polje 4 3 2 swmm fig 13 shows that swmm reproduces well the flooding dynamics of planinsko polje and its surrounding caves during the simulation a reasonable fit was obtained by adjusting the conduit diameters while the simulated stage of the polje shows also a delay compared to the observed data the main flood dynamics are better reproduced than with modflow nwt lake especially during the flood recession this is confirmed by a slightly higher value of nse 0 83 the modelled rise and recession of all caves are very similar to the recorded data with nse values of 0 91 for the cave 1 eastern ponors 0 89 for the cave 1 northern ponors and 0 84 for the cave linked to the estavelles the blue numbers visible on fig 13b and c indicate subsidiary events showing important water levels fluctuations in the caves that were not reproduced by the swmm model the most plausible explanation is that because these events were unable to flow over the banks of the river at the polje main gauging station their too low amplitude prevented swmm to reproduce them in both the polje and the caves to do so it would be necessary to take into account the exact volume of the riverbed as well as the surface volume relationship of the caves draining the polje as the later measurements are currently impossible to implement due to technical difficulties this will stay subject of future work similarly to modflow nwt lake the computed ponor outflow reaches a maximum value of 59 7 m3 s for the northern ponors and 17 5 m3 s for the eastern ponors the estavelle delivers a small in and outflow according to the position of its junction and its conduit diameter 5 discussion 5 1 parameters controlling flooding this section discusses how the flood amplitude and duration is affected by the parameters previously investigated the analyses allowed identifying particular situations that might promote flooding when i the polje is frequently subject to long recharge events that deliver an important volume of water during the event rise the meteorological conditions over the polje recharge area s as well as the capacity of the water to be rapidly transferred to the polje via a surface hydrographic network or through a cave system are the factors constraining the intensity and duration of the recharge ii the polje is recharged by one or by several recharge inputs that react simultaneously at their maximum discharge capacity if these recharge inputs are connected to separated recharge areas their simultaneous reaction at their maximum capacity will cause an extreme flood to occur conversely an unphased release of water by the different recharge inputs will reduce the probability of a severe flood event however it will increase the flood duration at lower elevations which can also affect the life of the inhabitants living in the polje vicinity a typical example is planinsko polje where extreme floods primarily result of a combination of high waters within the polje four recharge areas whereas an unphased recharge leads to long lasting floods at lower elevations kovačič and ravbar 2010 iii the polje has a poor outflow capacity at lower elevations this is caused by the absence or by an inefficient drainage from the lower ponor zones which will cause a frequent submersion of the polje lower parts for long periods iv the transmissivity of the aquifer draining the polje is too low to remove efficiently floodwater which causes an important and long backflooding therefore the value of the conduit diameter d1 is critical and should be absolutely investigated when doing modelling on a real field site as it might affect consequently both flood amplitude and duration conversely the storage capacity of the chamber ch is subsidiary and does not have a real effect on regulating flooding v the polje is connected to estavelles that have a junction located higher than the polje bottom the water balance of the estavelle will be positive towards the polje and will increase the flood amplitude and duration vi the polje has a small surface area this will promote floods at a high water level to occur especially if the outflow from the lower ponor zones is inefficient vii the initial water level in the polje is subsidiary and will contribute to increase the flood level for events of minor amplitude therefore severe flood events are prone to happen if one or more of the above conditions are met in addition it should be kept in mind that several of these parameters might change upon time for example the drainage capacity of the ponor zones and the aquifer transmissivity can be subject to temporal modifications that will impact the flood a higher flood event will be caused by the plugging of the ponor zones with tree branches such as in planinsko polje in february 2014 or by a sediment redeposition that will modify the transmissivity of the aquifer conduits mayaud et al 2016 conversely the flood amplitude and duration might be reduced by cleaning the ponor zones and their vicinity 5 2 comparison between modflow nwt lake and swmm numerical modelling with modflow nwt lake and swmm allows a comparison of both approaches while modflow nwt lake proved its usefulness to identify the parameters controlling flooding and evaluate their impact on the flood amplitude and duration the relatively acceptable fit obtained for planinsko polje should be taken cautiously the main reason is that the aquifer geometry is lumped into the ponors drain conductance this reduces the possibility to understand properly the flooding dynamics through the polje and its draining aquifer and prevents to gain valuable information on the aquifer geometry an evaluation on how the aquifer parameters might affect flooding is therefore not possible conversely swmm requires a higher design and calibration effort than modflow nwt lake but allows a better constraining of the model this is because the calibration relies on four observation points located in both the polje and its draining aquifer whereas the modflow model is calibrated using data of a single gauging station in addition swmm is more accurate than modflow nwt lake in terms of flow processes as it considers both conduit and turbulent flow even if the impact of the latter on the whole lake stage seems rather questionable due to the size of the lake it needs to be taken into account to reproduce properly the flow processes occurring downward the ponors by representing the aquifer geometry the swmm model contributes to improve the understanding of the flooding dynamics in planinsko polje all parameters that might influence flooding are considered within the model and can be evaluated upon each other therefore the use of a conduit based approach such as swmm is highly recommended as the aquifer draining the polje should be necessarily integrated in modelling attempts of real field cases still a single continuum model such as modflow nwt lake can be used under particular circumstances due to its easier implementation especially if the geometry of the draining aquifer is unknown or insignificant or if the polje is only sparsely monitored however it should only be viewed as a first attempt to roughly simulate the polje flooding dynamics finally it is worth adding that both models comport several uncertainties due to the complex nature of planinsko polje these uncertainties are related to the simplifications made by the conceptual model by the numerical limitations of each software as well as by the extrapolated parts of the models because of the absence of field data such is the case for the conduit network of the estavelles and its recharge event therefore both models need to be further tested and validated under other hydrological situations especially the swmm model could be refined by integrating other monitored caves located downward the caves presented in this example another improvement would be to consider the polje topography in order to better catch the propagation of smaller events through the polje and its surrounding caves such as the ones marked with blue arrows in fig 13 this would require a longer design and calibration effort but would reduce the uncertainties arising from the conceptual model as well as possible equifinality and non uniqueness problems that are recurrent to numerical modelling 6 conclusions this work represents an original contribution to understand the hydrological functioning of poljes the parameters assumed to control polje flooding were listed and tested using simple numerical models the impact of these parameters on the flood amplitude and duration was discussed and allowed to identify situations that can lead to severe flood events finally an application to a real polje was implemented using modflow nwt lake and swmm the results showed that even if modflow nwt lake might be used under particular circumstances the results produced limit the interpretation to what happen within the polje geomorphological borders which reduces considerably the understanding of the system the aquifer draining the polje should necessarily be taken into account to validate the conceptual hydrogeological model and properly understand the flooding dynamics therefore the use of an approach like swmm is highly recommended as it gives insights on the aquifer geometry and allows evaluating the impact of the aquifer parameters the method presented within this work is reproducible to other border and structural poljes and might also be applicable to turloughs and other karst areas encountering flooding moreover the results are found to have concrete applications simple and field site based numerical modelling can help selecting the best possible places to install a measurement network in non monitored poljes or improve the monitoring network of poljes already equipped in addition numerical modelling would be considerably useful to establish worst case flood scenarios specific to each polje as data from monitoring stations historical records of past floods and climate projections can be integrated within the model or used to interpret the results this would be very helpful for the people living around poljes especially if the frequency of extreme events is going to increase in the future as expected by current climate projections studies finally it should be emphasized that having two floods of similar amplitude and duration in a given polje do not guarantee that their parameters were identical during each event the flood should not be viewed as the consequence of a single parameter or an addition of several independent causes but as a complex parameter interaction that might evolve upon time this interaction should be investigated in details in future studies

have been suggested e g tiwari and chatterjee 2010a b 2011 valipour et al 2013 kumar et al 2015b chang and tsai 2016 nanda et al 2016 prasad et al 2017 tongal and booij 2018 yaseen et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 different studies also advocated flood forecasting models based on physically based streamflow routing methods e g perumal and sahoo 2007 perumal et al 2007 2009 2011 sahoo 2013 sahoo et al 2014 swain and sahoo 2015 swain et al 2018 however the operational real time conceptual or physically based flood forecasting models need inputs of real time rainfall and meteorological forecasts either from the telemetric raingauge stations or satellite estimates which are used in the rainfall runoff hydrological models in many world river basins the real time telemetric rainfalls are hardly available which made the researchers depend on the satellite based real time rainfall products the satellite based precipitation products of the climate prediction center morphing cmorph technique joyce et al 2004 tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm huffman et al 2007 and the improved global precipitation measurement gpm imerg precipitation nowcasts could be used for estimating streamflows in simulation mode yong et al 2012 kneis et al 2014 tong et al 2014a wang et al 2017 beria et al 2017 moreover the outputs of the atmospheric models after systematic correction with the gauge and satellite data are used as the relevant reanalysis rainfall products for example the reanalysis products called as the era from the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf could be used along with the numerical weather prediction nwp forecast products berrisford et al 2009 thiemig et al 2010 the meteorological forecasts from the nwp linked with different grid based hydrological models are in operation in different world river basins for lead time flood forecasting thielen et al 2009 bartholmes et al 2009 bürger et al 2009 hopson 2005 hopson and webster 2010 voisin et al 2011 tang and dennis 2014 wu et al 2014a tong et al 2014a b kauffeldt et al 2016 among the meteorological forcings available from the ecmwf deutscher wetterdienst dwd and consortium for small scale modeling cosmos the ecmwf that provides medium range lead time forecasts up to 10 days could be very much useful in real time flood forecasting at the river basin scale a flood forecasting model is generally comprised of two components i the deterministic component which is governed by the rainfall runoff rr model and ii the stochastic component which is based on the error series of the forecasted flow that involves forecasting of the residual errors of the simulated discharges among the rr models available in the literature for simulating the catchment runoff using spatially distributed rainfall the semi distributed variable infiltration capacity vic model is currently very popular e g yong et al 2012 tong et al 2014b srivastava et al 2017 2018 however this model has not been used till now in forecasting mode moreover flood forecasting cannot be separated from the problem of uncertainty which stems from the input model structure and parameter values thielen et al 2009 it has been found that the streamflow forecasting using the existing conceptual and semi distributed type of hydrological models results in higher uncertainty using the nwp forecasts therefore it is essential to reduce the uncertainty of flood forecasting by selecting a proper rr or land surface model such as the vic model with a proper error correction or updating sub model the real time error updating schemes differ according to the alteration of one or more factors of i input variables ii model state variables iii model parameters and iv output variable serban and askew 1991 wmo 1992 sene 2008 li et al 2013 wu et al 2014b the suitable choice of an updating scheme depends on the user requirements and the amount and the quality of input datasets although there is still no universal consensus on the best type of updating method for river flow forecasting wmo 1992 refsgaard et al 1997 among the updating schemes the output error correction is widely used which directly corrects the predicted discharge using discharge observations in real time without interfering with the operation of the rainfall runoff simulation model and there is no need of rerunning the rainfall runoff model or modifying the model parameters in the hydrologic literature many data driven error forecast models are available which include the linear autoregressive ar models shamseldin and o connor 2001 hopson and webster 2010 perumal et al 2011 autoregressive with exogenous input arx models shamseldin and o connor 2001 autoregressive moving average arma models brath et al 2002 broersen 2007 arma with exogenous input armax models bogner and kalas 2008 genetic programming gp method khu et al 2001 simple artificial neural network ann non linear autoregressive with exogenous inputs narx type of ann models anctil et al 2003 shamseldin and o connor 2001 goswami et al 2005 and sequential ann sann models prakash et al 2014 all these models are used for error forecasting based on the simulations of the non updated rainfall runoff model without interfering with the base model parameters the performance of the streamflow forecasting models depends on the accuracy of the constituent hydrological model the base model and the error updating sub model although many combination models are available in the literature the potential of the vic model with an error updating or correction scheme has not been evaluated until now moreover there is still uncertainty associated with the streamflow forecasts arising from the observed input data as well as the numerical weather forecasts the wavelet transform has been proved to be efficient when used in ann and other data driven models for flood forecasting using the rainfall and upstream discharge data tiwari and chatterjee 2011 nourani et al 2013 sehgal et al 2014a b shoaib et al 2014 2016 although different wavelet based models have been proved effective for streamflow modeling tiwari and chatterjee 2011 nourani et al 2013 nanda et al 2016 this has not been tested as an error forecasting model to update the streamflow forecasts therefore for reducing such uncertainty error forecasting using the wavelet transform could be an efficient error updating or correction scheme in integration with the vic rainfall runoff model forced with the ecmwf products the meteorological forecasts from global weather prediction system and the reanalysis data sources are being implemented worldwide for flood forecasting in vulnerable river systems in the typical flood prone mahanadi river basin in eastern india the inflow forecasting at the hirakud reservoir has been operating using the conventional gauge gauge correlation technique through the flood forecasting network of the central water commission cwc new delhi during the last two decades this basin has witnessed devastating floods jena et al 2014 and the worst flood situation in the mahanadi river delta was during september 2011 which was attributed to the improper reservoir operation subjected to the non availability of inflow forecasts with sufficient lead time wio 2011 mahapatra 2011 pattanaik and das 2015 in this context the potential of the nwp based meteorological forecasts e g ecmwf could be evaluated for its application in real time flood forecasting using the widely used semi distributed grid based vic model in light of this discussion this study aims i to test the capability of the vic model in real time streamflow forecasting with 1 5 days lead time using the era interim reanalysis rainfall and ecmwf real time meteorological forecasts and ii to develop suitable artificial intelligence based error correction models for the vic model to minimize the uncertainty in the streamflow forecasts resulted typically due to the biases in the ecmwf reanalysis and real time forecast products this paper is organized as follows in section 2 a brief description of the study area and data used is given followed by the methodology in section 3 results are presented and discussed in section 4 and section 5 concludes the study 2 study area and data used the study area covers the catchment of the hirakud reservoir encompassing about 83 400 km2 of the mahanadi river basin in eastern india fig 1 the sub catchments of the mahanadi river basin downstream to this reservoir are mostly flood prone this area lies in the tropical climatic region having a distinct wet season during june to september during which about 80 rainfall is received from the south west summer monsoon system in the peninsular indian sub continent the era interim is a reanalysis product of the global atmospheric forecasts at ecmwf which is available from 1st january 1979 onwards in near real time the era interim is produced through data assimilation system called as the integrated forecast system ifs the updates of the era interim take place on a monthly basis which is finally available as the archived product this reanalysis meteorological products from the era interim such as rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and wind speed at 0 25 latitude 0 25 longitude spatial and 12 hour temporal resolutions for the study period 2000 2011 were downloaded from the ecmwf webpage the corresponding gridded daily in situ rainfall data available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 was also obtained from the india meteorological department imd pai et al 2014 for evaluating the accuracy of the era interim rainfall product against the benchmark imd rainfall product these datasets were aggregated into daily time scales the observed daily inflow timeseries into the hirakud reservoir was collected for the period 2000 2011 from the hirakud dam project hdp authority burla the weather forecasts including rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and wind speed were obtained from the ecmwf note that the available ecmwf forecasts for the control run consist of the medium range forecasts with 10 days lead time at 12 h temporal and 0 5 0 5 spatial resolutions which were aggregated to a daily time step 00 00 24 00 coordinated universal time zone the ecmwf weather variables include the daily precipitation fields of convective precipitation cp and large scale surface precipitation lsp maximum mx2t and minimum mn2t temperatures and wind speeds u10 v10 subsequently the total precipitation forecasts were estimated as the sum of cp and lsp fields and the resultant wind speed forecasts were obtained as the square root of u10 2 v10 2 since these datasets are available at different spatial resolutions these were interpolated to a uniform 0 5 spatial resolution using bilinear interpolation technique in the typical study area considered in this paper the latest inflow forecasting system in operation for the hirakud reservoir is based on the streamflow forecasting by the mike11 rainfall runoff model cwc 2016 of the danish hydraulic institute dhi denmark before this the operational flood forecasting system was based on the static and lumped approaches using the upstream gauge to gauge correlation analysis that uses the observed discharges at five upstream base stations as shown in fig 1 cwc 1989 india wris version 4 1 2014 3 methodology the detailed framework of the forecasting methodology advocated herein is presented in figs 2 and 3 first the vic model was set up using the available daily timeseries data of the era interim for rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and wind speed subsequently the ecmwf meteorological forecasts were used in the standalone vic model to forecast the lead time streamflow this approach henceforth was named as the vic standalone approach the other four approaches involve the use of vic model in conjunction with the aru armaxu wnnu and wnarxu error correction or updating models for streamflow forecasting which are named as the vic aru vic armaxu vic wnnu and vic wnarxu models respectively therefore the vic standalone model works in the online simulation mode wherein the ecmwf forecasts of rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and wind speed are used in the vic model to simulate the lead time streamflow forecasts without any error correction conversely the vic aru vic armaxu vic wnnu and vic wnarxu model variants work in the online error updating mode wherein the ecmwf meteorological forecasts are used to simulate the historical streamflow by the vic model to generate an error timeseries during the warming up period corresponding to the observed data and then this error series is used to develop an error updating model to correct the biases in the lead time forecasting a brief description of the modeling framework and the error updating procedure are given below 3 1 vic land surface model the vic hydrological model liang et al 1994 1996 is a grid based semi distributed model that consists of two modules the water balance or the water and energy balance module and the routing module lohmann et al 1996 in the vic model the spatial variability of the infiltration capacity in different land uses is computed by the xianjiang model zhao et al 1980 while setting up the vic rainfall runoff model using the water balance mode the input database requires four major input files such as forcing files soil parameter file vegetation parameter file and vegetation library file the forcing file includes the meteorological inputs such as rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and wind speed timeseries in the form of ascii file generated for the individual grids of the catchment the soil texture map of the study area as developed by the food and agriculture organization fao was used in this study and subsequently the soil parameter file was generated for the vic model the land cover dataset at 1 km spatial resolution was downloaded from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr hansen et al 2000 subsequently the vegetation parameter file was generated based on the avhrr derived land cover interpolated at 0 5 0 5 resolution using the vegetation library file as developed at the university of washington nijssen et al 2001 the grid scale surface runoff and baseflow simulated by the vic model is first transported to the outlet of the cell using a triangular unit hydrograph and then routed in the river network to the basin outlet using the linearized saint venant equation the vic model was run at 0 5 0 5 grid size which is consistent with the resolution of the meteorological forecasts obtained from the ecmwf the daily scale hydro meteorological timeseries data of the year 2000 was used for model warming up before its calibration seven years 2001 2007 data was used for calibration and the rest four years data 2008 2011 was used for validating the vic model the model was calibrated using the reanalysis meteorological inputs from the era interim for setting up the model parameters viz exponent of variable infiltration capacity curve b fraction of the maximum baseflow where non linear baseflow begins ds maximum velocity of the baseflow dsmax fraction of the soil moisture when non linear baseflow begins ws and depths of the second and third soil layers d2 d3 the calibrated parameters of the vic model are mentioned in table 1 subsequently the ecmwf forecasts of rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and wind speed were used in the parameterized vic model to simulate the lead time streamflow forecasts for this the vic model was run up to the time of the forecast using the historical and real time rainfalls and the necessary meteorological inputs to generate model state variables at the time of the forecast the calibrated vic model was run at a 30 days monthly window using i the historical era interim rainfalls for the past 25 days to generate the antecedent soil moisture condition for the study area and ii the ecmwf meteorological forecasts for the remaining five days to simulate streamflow with a lead time of 1 5 days the uncertainty associated with the ecmwf forecasts would get transmitted to the streamflow forecasts at 1 5 days lead time which can be improved by linking the vic model with the error forecasting model as described below 3 2 error forecasting models for updating the streamflow forecasts simulated by the vic land surface model an error model can be developed using the input error timeseries of ε t ε t 1 ε t d obtained during the model calibration phase where ε t is the simulation error between the observed qobs and vic simulated qsim discharges at any time t estimated as ε t qobs t qsim t and d is the effectively correlated time lag determined by the auto correlation function analysis of the error timeseries subsequently the error can be predicted at a forecast time level of α using the historical error series as 1 ε t α f ε sim t ε sim t 1 ε sim t 2 ε sim t d where f denotes the linear or non linear error forecasting models selected based on the hierarchical model complexity the details about these error correction models are described below 3 2 1 aru error correction model among the linear error updating models generally used for flood forecasting brath et al 2002 broersen 2007 bogner and kalas 2008 perumal et al 2011 the ar model is generally applied for updating the water level or streamflow forecast at smaller time step due to its simplicity the simple ar model could be mathematically represented as follows 2 ε t α a i i 1 d ε t 1 i e t α where ε qobs t qsim t simulated streamflow biases by the vic model used as exogenous inputs ε error simulated by the aru model e white noise d time delay for inputs which decides the order of the ar model and α lead time of forecast 3 2 2 armaxu error correction model as evaluated in different flood forecasting studies the application of the armax model has been found widely shamseldin and o connor 2001 brath et al 2002 broersen 2007 bogner and kalas 2008 this model is capable of incorporating exogenous input variables in addition to the autoregressive endogenous inputs expressed as 3 a q ε t α b q i 1 d ε t 1 i j 1 τ ε t α j c q e t α where d time delay for exogenous inputs used in the armax model τ time delay for endogenous inputs and a q b q and c q are the polynomials of the regression equation the degree of individual polynomials was decided by the trial and error approach 3 2 3 wnnu error correction model the wnnu error correction model is based on a mother wavelet function that constructs a family of wavelets of a finite interval morlet et al 1982 characterized by continuous and discrete wavelet transforms the non stationarity in the forecast error timeseries could be minimized with the wavelet based multi resolution analysis that decomposes the input data into approximate and detail components finally eliminating the noise signal to obtain the temporal and the spectral information contained in the simulation error timeseries data during the calibration period wavelet decomposition was carried out for decomposition of the error signals at level 5 the daubechies db2 wavelet function was employed which produces a low frequency sub signal approximation viz a5 and five high frequency sub signal details at different scales viz d1 d2 d3 d4 and d5 as shown in fig 4 for a typical case these wavelet components for each time lagged error series were analyzed using the correlation analysis to remove the weak signals from the original error series considering the correlation coefficients r 0 10 e g tiwari and chatterjee 2011 shoaib et al 2014 the most correlated signals were then added and the new error timeseries was used in the input layer of the wnnu model to forecast the lead time error ε t α the structure of a wnn model could be as shown in fig 3a 3 2 4 wnarx error correction model the wnarxu error model integrates the concepts of wnn and nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs narx models in which the input variables are pre processed by discrete wavelet transformation dwt to be used in the narx model nanda et al 2016 this hybrid wnarxu model could address the issues of non stationarity in the input data and catchment memory through multi scale dwt and autoregressive components of the outputs respectively in this study the wnarxu error model as shown in fig 3b uses the endogenous inputs in the form of the most recent historical biases as simulated by the standalone vic model εsim up to the current time level and recurrent exogenous feedback inputs of ε as predicted by the model during the pre forecast lead time levels these features of noise removal and short term autoregressive in the wnarxu model could be better utilized for higher lead time forecasting this wnarxu error model can be expressed as 4 ε wnarx t α f w ε sim t w ε sim t 1 w ε sim t 2 w ε sim t α 1 w ε sim t α 2 for any α time step ahead forecast the error can be forecasted by using the wnarxu model with a log sigmoid function in the hidden layer of the neural network as 5 ε t α 1 1 exp i 1 d ε t 1 i w i j 1 τ ε t α j w j where ε t α is the prediction error at α time steps ahead d is the effective time lag for the exogenous inputs of ε τ is the effective time lag for the endogenous recurrent inputs in the wnarxu model framework and w is the weight of the neuron subsequently for real time streamflow forecasting the lead time error forecasts predicted using the wnarxu error model can be used to update the discharge forecasts as fig 3 6 q t α q sim t α ε t α where q t α updated streamflow forecast qsim t α streamflow forecast as simulated by the standalone vic model with ecmwf meteorological forecasts and ε t α lead time error forecast as simulated by the error forecasting model 3 3 performance evaluation of the models first the rainfall estimates of the era interim and forecasts from ecmwf were compared with the gridded imd rainfall products as the benchmark using two skill measures of the correlation coefficient r and percentage bias pbias and two threshold statistics of probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far subsequently the flood forecasting performance of the models was assessed using five performance measure indices as i nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 ii correlation coefficient r iii mean absolute error mae iv percent error in volume evol and v uncertainty analysis in a situation where the rainfall forecasts are available the standalone vic model produces deterministic streamflow forecasts the predictive uncertainty pu associated with the vic error updating model variants can be estimated with certain probability of occurrence raiffa and schlaifer 2000 todini 2007 using the probabilistic post processing techniques krzysztofowicz and maranzano 2004 raferty et al 2003 seo et al 2006 reggiani and weerts 2008 recently for deterministic forecasts pu estimation weerts et al 2011 coccia and todini 2011 kumar et al 2015a barbetta et al 2016 2017 has been carried out using the quantile regression qr approach koenker 2005 this method requires estimating the relationship between the probability distribution of the errors and the forecasted values at a given lead time using the qr koenker and basset 1978 in this study the qr relationships were established using the streamflow forecasts and the associated errors residuals for each lead time of interest it is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the residuals ε and forecasts q in normalized form i e normalized discharge nq and normalized residual n ε koenker 2005 koenker and hallock 2001 weerts et al 2011 which can be expressed as 7 n ε i m nq i c where m and c are the slope and intercept parameters respectively i is the level of the data sample to carry out the regression analysis the sum of the weighted absolute residuals can be minimized using the objective function expressed as 8 m i n i m i z e i 1 n ρ β n ε i β m β nq i β c β where β desired quantile and ρ β quantile regression function that pushes ε i β to its desired location n no of data samples to describe the error distribution over different quantiles the qr programming functions quantilereg built in in the matlab package were used in this study using the calibration dataset the regression between n ε and nq was analyzed to obtain the regression lines for n ε β at every five percentile levels of β 5 10 15 95 the residuals in the gaussian domain n ε β at different quantiles were then converted to the original domain ε β the error quantiles were added to the forecasted discharge for obtaining the updated discharge at different quantiles as 9 q β t α q sim t α ε β the parameters m and c of the quantile regression equations were imposed on the forecasted streamflow with linear interpolation or if the forecasted streamflows were found outside the domain of the calibration dataset with linear extrapolation 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of the era interim rainfall product the era interim rainfall products for the selected study area were evaluated against the imd in situ rainfall products due to the tropical monsoon climate in the study area all the high flow events generally occur during july to september and hence the rainfalls occurring during 15th june to 15th october of 2000 2011 were selected for evaluation for analysis the monsoon rainfall timeseries rf t was divided into three threshold regimes of low medium and high as rf t µ µ rf t µ σ and rf t µ σ respectively where µ mean and σ standard deviation of the rf t timeseries as illustrated in fig 5 for the considered study period of 2000 2011 the era interim rainfall product tended to highly overestimate the low rainfall values with pbias 145 89 whereas the medium rainfall values show pbias 10 89 the heavy rainfalls were mostly underestimated with pbias 39 the pod and far analysis in fig 5 illustrates that the era interim rainfall product poorly captured the very high 95 percentile of 29 45 mm day rainfall events with a hit rate of 0 30 whereas it could not capture the peak storms of threshold magnitude of 60 mm day 4 2 evaluation of the ecmwf rainfall forecasts similarly for analysis of the mean areal ecmwf rainfall forecasts the monsoon rainfalls during the study period were divided into three threshold regimes of low medium and high rainfalls based on whether rainfall r µ µ r µ σ and r µ σ respectively where µ mean 9 07 mm day and σ standard deviation 11 49 mm day of the benchmark imd monsoonal rainfall products fig 6 depicts the bias estimates for the 1 to 5 days ahead ecmwf rainfall forecasts to capture the low medium and high rainfall threshold regimes as revealed in fig 6 the ecmwf rainfall forecasts at all the five lead times grossly overestimated the benchmark low rainfalls with pbias 83 whereas the high rainfall regimes were underestimated with 57 pbias 29 the medium rainfalls at 1 day lead time were overestimated by the ecmwf product with pbias 14 whereas these rainfalls were well estimated at higher lead times upto 4 days pbias 10 and underpredicted at 5 day lead time with pbias 16 similarly the pod and far analyses in fig 7 revealed that the 1 day and 2 day lead time ecmwf rainfall forecasts hit the 95 percentile rainfall 29 45 mm day by 50 and 30 times respectively and the hit rate decreased gradually at 3 4 and 5 days lead times with hit rates of 20 further it was found that the ecmwf rainfall forecasts failed to detect the high rainfall events above the threshold value of 95 percentile rainfall moreover the far estimates were very high for the high rainfall rainfall 95 percentile events with 0 6 and 0 7 at 1 and 2 days lead times respectively and far further increased to 0 75 for higher lead times of 3 5 days 4 3 performance of the standalone vic model for streamflow simulation the standalone vic model was calibrated separately with the era interim historical rainfall timeseries considering 2000 2007 as the calibration period in which the year 2000 was used for warming up the model to generate initial condition the calibrated vic model parameters while using the era interim rainfall inputs are listed in table 1 the model was validated for the period 2008 2011 fig 8 a illustrates the performance of the standalone vic during the calibration phase which revealed that the standalone vic model was well calibrated with nse 0 67 mae 586 64 m3 s and r 0 82 however the peak discharge events were mostly under predicted and some of the low flows were overestimated resulting in a large error in volume evol 8 since for flood forecasting the extreme streamflow events during the monsoon rainy season is of much interest in the study area the performance of the standalone vic model in simulation mode during the validation 2008 2011 period is illustrated in fig 8b moreover the corresponding mean areal rainfall for the catchment is shown in the secondary axis for the respective rainfall events the timeseries and scatter plots in fig 8b revealed that for the highly biased reanalysis rainfall inputs the performance of the standalone vic model in simulation mode reduced with the estimates of nse 0 45 r 0 70 mae 1375 26 m3 s and evol 16 50 this could be attributed to the high underprediction in the rainfall estimates for the corresponding high flow events hence it is expected that the impact of the high biases associated with the reanalysis rainfall product on the streamflows could be well addressed by hybrid models henceforth for real time flood forecasting the reanalysis rainfall was used as an input in the vic model for generating initial catchment state along with the use of ecmwf meteorological forecasts 4 4 performance of the standalone vic model in simulation mode with ecmwf weather forecasts fig 9 illustrates the timeseries and scatter plots of the streamflow forecasts at 1 to 5 days lead times by the standalone vic model using the corresponding lead time ecmwf meteorological forecasts of rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and wind speed it can be surmised from fig 9 and table 2 that in forecasting mode the standalone vic model underestimated the discharge forecasts with nse 0 40 mae 1250 m3 s evol 30 and r 0 7 for 1 5 days lead time forecasts the poor performance of the standalone vic model during the forecast period could be attributed to the high biases in the ecmwf rainfall forecasts and or the insufficient initial soil moisture condition before the forecast day as generated using the reanalysis rainfall product of era interim hence the lead time streamflow forecasting using the vic standalone model is unacceptable 4 5 lead time inflow forecasting by the vic model in the error updating mode fig 10 illustrates the variation of autocorrelation functions of the error timeseries of the vic simulations with respect to different time lags it can be envisaged from fig 10 that the error time series significantly correlate r 0 4 up to a lag time of four days which was used in the error correction model further it can be visualized from figs 11 14 and table 2 that the streamflow forecasts by the vic aru vic armaxu vic wnnu and vic wnarxu model variants in the error updating mode were much improved than that of the standalone vic model at all the lead times as considered herein the linear vic aru and vic armaxu error updating models produced accurate forecasts up to 2 days lead time although its performance was unacceptable at 3 to 5 days lead times nse 0 50 the streamflow forecasting performance of the vic wnnu model was improved over the vic armaxu model for up to 2 days lead time at 1 day lead time the performance measures by the vic wnnu model were nse 0 82 r 0 91 mae 553 82 m3 s and evol 1 61 and at 2 days lead time these error measures were nse 0 77 r 0 90 mae 795 98 m3 s and evol 16 21 the vic wnarxu error updating model performed the best with the ranges of nse 0 76 0 88 r 0 88 0 94 mae 779 59 870 02 m3 s and evol 0 13 5 39 see table 2 overall the performance of the vic standalone and the three error updating model variants improved in the order vic standalone vic armaxu vic aru vic wnnu vic wnarxu signifying the superiority of the wnarxu error forecasting model the peak flow forecasting ability of the vic standalone vic aru vic armaxu vic wnnu and vic wnarxu models were also evaluated for the four typical observed annual maximum peak inflows of 18 156 m3 s 15 363 m3 s 9169 m3 s and 29 183 m3 s into the hirakud reservoir occurred during the years 2008 2009 2010 and 2011 respectively hereafter these four peak events are named as peak 1 2 3 and 4 respectively these peak flows were specifically responsible for severe flooding problem at the downstream reaches of the mahanadi river basin followed by improper reservoir operation due to lack of inflow forecasting at higher lead times table 3 shows the error in peak epeak estimates by all the model variants in reproducing the typical inflow peak floods at 1 to 5 day forecast lead times as compared to the vic standalone vic aru vic armaxu and vic wnnu models the peak flows were very well forecasted by the vic wnarxu model with epeak 20 in most of the cases even up to 5 days of forecast lead time the vic standalone model highly under predicted the peak flows with epeak 50 to predict the high discharge flow the large deviations between the observed and modeled data are clearly seen in the vic standalone vic aru vic armaxu and vic wnnu models with epeak 20 in most of the cases up to 5 days of forecast lead time see table 3 among the advocated error updating models the peak flood forecasting capability was improved in the order vic armaxu vic aru vic wnnu vic wnarxu e g fig 15 the results in table 3 and fig 15 evidenced that the semi distributed vic standalone forecast model could not perform efficiently for rainfall runoff transformation either due to the limitation in the model parameterization or due to the input data uncertainty in the ecmwf meteorological forecasts so that this model could not accurately forecast the streamflow even at 1 day lead time conversely the error updating models especially the wnarxu model could accurately forecast these associated errors with the base model and input ecmwf meteorological forecasts up to 5 days lead time the aru and armaxu models due to their linear framework failed to reproduce accurate lead time error forecasts in the wnnu and wnarxu error updating models the wavelet decomposition reduced the uncertainty in the prediction error arising from the non stationary hydro meteorological timeseries as well as the bias in the nwp forecast outputs moreover the dynamic nn based wnarxu model due to its autoregressive nature captured the memory of the catchment process at higher lead times to reproduce better error forecasts using the recent past feedback errors as model inputs however due to the absence of an autoregressive component in the wnnu model only the wavelet decomposition in the static nn framework could not perform well beyond 3 days lead time this could be the reason that among the error updating models the peak flood forecasting capability was improved in the order vic standalone vic armaxu vic aru vic wnnu vic wnarxu hence the output post processing of the model forecasts would be advantageous for discharge forecasting at higher lead time rather than conducting state updating at each forecasting time step further to test the capability of the vic wnarxu model for extended lead time forecasts simulations were carried out by this model for maximum up to 10 days lead times as the ecmwf meteorological predictions are available for only up to 10 days ahead the corresponding performance measures by the vic wnarxu model at 1 to 10 days forecast lead times are illustrated in fig 16 it can be envisaged from fig 16 that although the nse and r estimates do not drastically get reduced up to 10 days lead time the mae and evol estimates may only be acceptable up to 9 days lead time however in stricter sense considering nse 0 7 as the acceptable limit the vic wnarxu model may be applicable up to a forecasting lead time of maximum 7 days with the increase in the forecasting lead time from 6 to 10 days generally the error in the forecasted peak was increased slightly not shown here for brevity secondly the performance of the vic wnarxu model is mostly driven by the vic hydrological model the base model that considers all the catchment hydrological processes the wnarxu model accounts for the dynamic nature of error series integrating the concepts of ann wavelet transformation both endogenous and exogenous inputs and feedback of nonlinear recurrent inputs that make it a reliable and consistent error updating model therefore it is seen that unlike the other existing models the performance of the vic wnarxu model does not deteriorate drastically even at 10 days forecast lead time since the base vic model can account for the variability in hydro meteorological geographical conditions very well in its model framework as has been tested in many world river basins logically the vic wnarxu model can also perform very well in other world river basins in online forecasting mode the improvement in the inflow forecasting by the vic wnarxu model over the standalone vic model is highly significant for its implementation in a real time flood forecasting system although the standalone nn based data driven models could perform efficiently for discharge forecasting these fully black box models cannot account for the spatially distributed hydro meteorological inputs hydrological processes of streamflow generation and land use change effects in a catchment conversely the vic wnarxu error updating model retains the advantages of the catchment process based framework and the stochastic nature of the errors associated with the model and data uncertainties 4 6 assessment of predictive uncertainty pu of the error updating models to assess the uncertainty in operational flood forecasting by the developed error correction models quantile error models were developed the forecast timeseries by different model variants were analyzed for determining the quantiles β ranging from 0 05 to 0 95 to evaluate the performance of different models in terms of pu estimation the percentiles estimated by the qr method and the corresponding observed occurrences were compared as shown in fig 17 fig 17 illustrates the cumulated 0 05 5 estimated percentiles against the corresponding percentages of observed data that falls below each percentile where nobs i is the number of observations below each percentile i and n is the sample size the 1 1 line in fig 17 determines the perfect prediction and the underestimation or over estimation of the observed streamflows for a particular percentile is indicated by the deviations from the 1 1 line it can be found that in case of the forecasts by the vic standalone and vic armaxu models the qr estimated percentiles were smaller than the observed occurrences in the whole range of β 5 95 this indicates that the discharge timeseries estimated by these models were underestimated for the vic wnnu model the qr estimated percentiles were equal to the observed occurrences almost up to 50 however the observed occurrences were higher for β 50 95 this indicates that for the vic wnnu model the discharge timeseries corresponding to the 50 95 percentiles were underestimated which can be found in the hydrographs as shown in fig 13 the underestimation of the discharge forecasts by the vic standalone model was partially improved by using the vic wnnu error updating model it is found that for the vic wnarxu model the qr estimated percentiles almost fall on the 1 1 line which indicates that the qr estimated percentiles were same as that of the observed occurrences except for a small deviation in the high percentile flows as the forecasting lead time increased the higher deviation of the points from the 1 1 line indicates more discrepancies between the observed occurrences and the qr estimated percentiles the uncertainty in the vic wnarxu model was significantly reduced at higher forecasting lead times the ranges of the confidence interval ci bands for different model variants are shown in fig 18 the 90 95th 5th percentile and 50 75th 25th percentile ci bands for different model variants in fig 18 indicate that the average width of the ci bands varied in the order vic standalone vic armaxu vic aru vic wnnu vic wnarxu for both these cis as shown in fig 18 the average width of the 90 ci band varied in the ranges of 2745 3349 m3 s for the vic wnarxu model 3156 6143 m3 s for the vic wnnu model 4234 6329 m3 s for the vic aru model 4242 6394 m3 s for the vic armaxu model and 6409 6945 m3 s for the vic standalone model at 1 5 days lead time forecasts the higher width of the ci band indicates higher uncertainty associated with the vic standalone vic aru and vic armaxu models which were subsequently reduced in the vic wnnu and vic wnarxu models overall the vic wnarxu model was found to be robust in producing the forecasts with narrow ci band which would help in better decision making than solely using the deterministic forecasts during the multi purpose reservoir operation hence the reservoir inflow forecasting by the vic wnarxu model with uncertainty bands could successfully be employed for flood prone river basins world wide with the forcings of the ecmwf meteorological forecasts and the era interim rainfalls 5 conclusions for flood management it is necessary to have an efficient real time reservoir inflow forecasting system under limited hydro meteorological data availability conditions hence in this study a novel approach of the external wnarxu based error updating model was integrated with the vic land surface model to forecast the reservoir inflow well in advance at 1 to 7 day lead times the methodology developed herein was tested for real time inflow forecasting to the hirakud reservoir involving an extensive evaluation of the era interim rainfall products and the ecmwf meteorological forecasts as the model inputs based on the results this study concludes as follows 1 overall the ecmwf rainfall forecasts and era interim real time rainfall products could moderately reproduce the reference imd gauged rainfalls over the hirakud reservoir catchment both the ecmwf and era interim rainfall products were associated with low correlation and high bias signifying the need for systematic error updating when used in any rainfall runoff model operating in forecasting mode 2 the higher pod in the low rainfall regimes and high far in the high rainfall regimes indicated the randomness in the nwp errors in the ecmwf and era interim outputs 3 the standalone vic model with the ecmwf meteorological forecasts showed significant under prediction of the inflow forecasts at 1 to 5 day lead times this makes the standalone vic model unsuitable for operational flood forecasting and flood warning 4 the shortcomings in the standalone vic model forecasts forced with the ecmwf meteorological forecasts could effectively be addressed by the proposed error updating scheme using the vic wnnu model up to 2 days and the vic wnarxu model up to 7 days lead times the dynamic neural network structure of the wnarxu error model with the noise reduction property of the wavelet transform and the short term autoregressive features could effectively reduce the uncertainties in higher lead time streamflow forecasting using the nwp overall the accuracy in inflow forecasting has improved significantly with the increase in the model complexity in the order vic standalone vic armaxu vic aru vic wnnu vic wnarxu 5 for real time flood forecasting in data scarce regions the use of era interim rainfall products in the vic wnarxu model with ecmwf meteorological forecasts could be a realistic option overall the proposed vic wnarxu model could address the issue of reservoir inflow forecasting with sufficient lead times to be deployed in reservoir regulation system this could help in reducing the downstream flood havoc resulting from the improper reservoir operation declaration of competing interest the authors declare

6386,as a non structural river basin management option development of a reliable inflow forecasting system using the hydrological models is essential to aid in real time reservoir operation for real time streamflow forecasting this study evaluates the capability of the variable infiltration capacity vic in integration with the linear autoregressive aru autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs armaxu nonlinear static wavelet based neural network wnnu and dynamic wavelet based non linear autoregressive with exogenous inputs wnarxu variants of error correction sub models in comparison with the predictions by the standalone vic model forced with european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf and era interim reanalysis products these vic standalone vic aru vic armaxu vic wnnu and vic wnarxu frameworks are field tested for 1 to 5 days lead time streamflow forecasting in the hirakud reservoir catchment of the mahanadi river basin in eastern india the performance evaluation measures and quantile regression qr based predictive uncertainty pu analysis reveal that the vic wnarxu model is the best approach for short to medium range flood forecasting with up to 7 days lead time having the potential to be used in other world river basins as a component of the early flood warning system keywords ecmwf error updating flood forecast vic wnarx 1 introduction with the growing concern of flood havoc in many world river basins the importance of real time flood forecasting is recognized as a non structural measure for developing flood warning systems to operate multi purpose reservoirs for flood control reliable inflow forecasts into the reservoir with sufficient lead time are imperative generally the reliability of the lead time of streamflow forecasts is assessed by the minimum period of advance warning required for the preparatory action of disaster management if forecasts are to be based on the available historical discharge or water level records extrapolation of these records over a certain period is adopted in the hydrologic literature for flood forecasting the neural network based data driven models using discharge or water level as inputs have been suggested e g tiwari and chatterjee 2010a b 2011 valipour et al 2013 kumar et al 2015b chang and tsai 2016 nanda et al 2016 prasad et al 2017 tongal and booij 2018 yaseen et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 different studies also advocated flood forecasting models based on physically based streamflow routing methods e g perumal and sahoo 2007 perumal et al 2007 2009 2011 sahoo 2013 sahoo et al 2014 swain and sahoo 2015 swain et al 2018 however the operational real time conceptual or physically based flood forecasting models need inputs of real time rainfall and meteorological forecasts either from the telemetric raingauge stations or satellite estimates which are used in the rainfall runoff hydrological models in many world river basins the real time telemetric rainfalls are hardly available which made the researchers depend on the satellite based real time rainfall products the satellite based precipitation products of the climate prediction center morphing cmorph technique joyce et al 2004 tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm huffman et al 2007 and the improved global precipitation measurement gpm imerg precipitation nowcasts could be used for estimating streamflows in simulation mode yong et al 2012 kneis et al 2014 tong et al 2014a wang et al 2017 beria et al 2017 moreover the outputs of the atmospheric models after systematic correction with the gauge and satellite data are used as the relevant reanalysis rainfall products for example the reanalysis products called as the era from the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf could be used along with the numerical weather prediction nwp forecast products berrisford et al 2009 thiemig et al 2010 the meteorological forecasts from the nwp linked with different grid based hydrological models are in operation in different world river basins for lead time flood forecasting thielen et al 2009 bartholmes et al 2009 bürger et al 2009 hopson 2005 hopson and webster 2010 voisin et al 2011 tang and dennis 2014 wu et al 2014a tong et al 2014a b kauffeldt et al 2016 among the meteorological forcings available from the ecmwf deutscher wetterdienst dwd and consortium for small scale modeling cosmos the ecmwf that provides medium range lead time forecasts up to 10 days could be very much useful in real time flood forecasting at the river basin scale a flood forecasting model is generally comprised of two components i the deterministic component which is governed by the rainfall runoff rr model and ii the stochastic component which is based on the error series of the forecasted flow that involves forecasting of the residual errors of the simulated discharges among the rr models available in the literature for simulating the catchment runoff using spatially distributed rainfall the semi distributed variable infiltration capacity vic model is currently very popular e g yong et al 2012 tong et al 2014b srivastava et al 2017 2018 however this model has not been used till now in forecasting mode moreover flood forecasting cannot be separated from the problem of uncertainty which stems from the input model structure and parameter values thielen et al 2009 it has been found that the streamflow forecasting using the existing conceptual and semi distributed type of hydrological models results in higher uncertainty using the nwp forecasts therefore it is essential to reduce the uncertainty of flood forecasting by selecting a proper rr or land surface model such as the vic model with a proper error correction or updating sub model the real time error updating schemes differ according to the alteration of one or more factors of i input variables ii model state variables iii model parameters and iv output variable serban and askew 1991 wmo 1992 sene 2008 li et al 2013 wu et al 2014b the suitable choice of an updating scheme depends on the user requirements and the amount and the quality of input datasets although there is still no universal consensus on the best type of updating method for river flow forecasting wmo 1992 refsgaard et al 1997 among the updating schemes the output error correction is widely used which directly corrects the predicted discharge using discharge observations in real time without interfering with the operation of the rainfall runoff simulation model and there is no need of rerunning the rainfall runoff model or modifying the model parameters in the hydrologic literature many data driven error forecast models are available which include the linear autoregressive ar models shamseldin and o connor 2001 hopson and webster 2010 perumal et al 2011 autoregressive with exogenous input arx models shamseldin and o connor 2001 autoregressive moving average arma models brath et al 2002 broersen 2007 arma with exogenous input armax models bogner and kalas 2008 genetic programming gp method khu et al 2001 simple artificial neural network ann non linear autoregressive with exogenous inputs narx type of ann models anctil et al 2003 shamseldin and o connor 2001 goswami et al 2005 and sequential ann sann models prakash et al 2014 all these models are used for error forecasting based on the simulations of the non updated rainfall runoff model without interfering with the base model parameters the performance of the streamflow forecasting models depends on the accuracy of the constituent hydrological model the base model and the error updating sub model although many combination models are available in the literature the potential of the vic model with an error updating or correction scheme has not been evaluated until now moreover there is still uncertainty associated with the streamflow forecasts arising from the observed input data as well as the numerical weather forecasts the wavelet transform has been proved to be efficient when used in ann and other data driven models for flood forecasting using the rainfall and upstream discharge data tiwari and chatterjee 2011 nourani et al 2013 sehgal et al 2014a b shoaib et al 2014 2016 although different wavelet based models have been proved effective for streamflow modeling tiwari and chatterjee 2011 nourani et al 2013 nanda et al 2016 this has not been tested as an error forecasting model to update the streamflow forecasts therefore for reducing such uncertainty error forecasting using the wavelet transform could be an efficient error updating or correction scheme in integration with the vic rainfall runoff model forced with the ecmwf products the meteorological forecasts from global weather prediction system and the reanalysis data sources are being implemented worldwide for flood forecasting in vulnerable river systems in the typical flood prone mahanadi river basin in eastern india the inflow forecasting at the hirakud reservoir has been operating using the conventional gauge gauge correlation technique through the flood forecasting network of the central water commission cwc new delhi during the last two decades this basin has witnessed devastating floods jena et al 2014 and the worst flood situation in the mahanadi river delta was during september 2011 which was attributed to the improper reservoir operation subjected to the non availability of inflow forecasts with sufficient lead time wio 2011 mahapatra 2011 pattanaik and das 2015 in this context the potential of the nwp based meteorological forecasts e g ecmwf could be evaluated for its application in real time flood forecasting using the widely used semi distributed grid based vic model in light of this discussion this study aims i to test the capability of the vic model in real time streamflow forecasting with 1 5 days lead time using the era interim reanalysis rainfall and ecmwf real time meteorological forecasts and ii to develop suitable artificial intelligence based error correction models for the vic model to minimize the uncertainty in the streamflow forecasts resulted typically due to the biases in the ecmwf reanalysis and real time forecast products this paper is organized as follows in section 2 a brief description of the study area and data used is given followed by the methodology in section 3 results are presented and discussed in section 4 and section 5 concludes the study 2 study area and data used the study area covers the catchment of the hirakud reservoir encompassing about 83 400 km2 of the mahanadi river basin in eastern india fig 1 the sub catchments of the mahanadi river basin downstream to this reservoir are mostly flood prone this area lies in the tropical climatic region having a distinct wet season during june to september during which about 80 rainfall is received from the south west summer monsoon system in the peninsular indian sub continent the era interim is a reanalysis product of the global atmospheric forecasts at ecmwf which is available from 1st january 1979 onwards in near real time the era interim is produced through data assimilation system called as the integrated forecast system ifs the updates of the era interim take place on a monthly basis which is finally available as the archived product this reanalysis meteorological products from the era interim such as rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and wind speed at 0 25 latitude 0 25 longitude spatial and 12 hour temporal resolutions for the study period 2000 2011 were downloaded from the ecmwf webpage the corresponding gridded daily in situ rainfall data available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 was also obtained from the india meteorological department imd pai et al 2014 for evaluating the accuracy of the era interim rainfall product against the benchmark imd rainfall product these datasets were aggregated into daily time scales the observed daily inflow timeseries into the hirakud reservoir was collected for the period 2000 2011 from the hirakud dam project hdp authority burla the weather forecasts including rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and wind speed were obtained from the ecmwf note that the available ecmwf forecasts for the control run consist of the medium range forecasts with 10 days lead time at 12 h temporal and 0 5 0 5 spatial resolutions which were aggregated to a daily time step 00 00 24 00 coordinated universal time zone the ecmwf weather variables include the daily precipitation fields of convective precipitation cp and large scale surface precipitation lsp maximum mx2t and minimum mn2t temperatures and wind speeds u10 v10 subsequently the total precipitation forecasts were estimated as the sum of cp and lsp fields and the resultant wind speed forecasts were obtained as the square root of u10 2 v10 2 since these datasets are available at different spatial resolutions these were interpolated to a uniform 0 5 spatial resolution using bilinear interpolation technique in the typical study area considered in this paper the latest inflow forecasting system in operation for the hirakud reservoir is based on the streamflow forecasting by the mike11 rainfall runoff model cwc 2016 of the danish hydraulic institute dhi denmark before this the operational flood forecasting system was based on the static and lumped approaches using the upstream gauge to gauge correlation analysis that uses the observed discharges at five upstream base stations as shown in fig 1 cwc 1989 india wris version 4 1 2014 3 methodology the detailed framework of the forecasting methodology advocated herein is presented in figs 2 and 3 first the vic model was set up using the available daily timeseries data of the era interim for rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and wind speed subsequently the ecmwf meteorological forecasts were used in the standalone vic model to forecast the lead time streamflow this approach henceforth was named as the vic standalone approach the other four approaches involve the use of vic model in conjunction with the aru armaxu wnnu and wnarxu error correction or updating models for streamflow forecasting which are named as the vic aru vic armaxu vic wnnu and vic wnarxu models respectively therefore the vic standalone model works in the online simulation mode wherein the ecmwf forecasts of rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and wind speed are used in the vic model to simulate the lead time streamflow forecasts without any error correction conversely the vic aru vic armaxu vic wnnu and vic wnarxu model variants work in the online error updating mode wherein the ecmwf meteorological forecasts are used to simulate the historical streamflow by the vic model to generate an error timeseries during the warming up period corresponding to the observed data and then this error series is used to develop an error updating model to correct the biases in the lead time forecasting a brief description of the modeling framework and the error updating procedure are given below 3 1 vic land surface model the vic hydrological model liang et al 1994 1996 is a grid based semi distributed model that consists of two modules the water balance or the water and energy balance module and the routing module lohmann et al 1996 in the vic model the spatial variability of the infiltration capacity in different land uses is computed by the xianjiang model zhao et al 1980 while setting up the vic rainfall runoff model using the water balance mode the input database requires four major input files such as forcing files soil parameter file vegetation parameter file and vegetation library file the forcing file includes the meteorological inputs such as rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and wind speed timeseries in the form of ascii file generated for the individual grids of the catchment the soil texture map of the study area as developed by the food and agriculture organization fao was used in this study and subsequently the soil parameter file was generated for the vic model the land cover dataset at 1 km spatial resolution was downloaded from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr hansen et al 2000 subsequently the vegetation parameter file was generated based on the avhrr derived land cover interpolated at 0 5 0 5 resolution using the vegetation library file as developed at the university of washington nijssen et al 2001 the grid scale surface runoff and baseflow simulated by the vic model is first transported to the outlet of the cell using a triangular unit hydrograph and then routed in the river network to the basin outlet using the linearized saint venant equation the vic model was run at 0 5 0 5 grid size which is consistent with the resolution of the meteorological forecasts obtained from the ecmwf the daily scale hydro meteorological timeseries data of the year 2000 was used for model warming up before its calibration seven years 2001 2007 data was used for calibration and the rest four years data 2008 2011 was used for validating the vic model the model was calibrated using the reanalysis meteorological inputs from the era interim for setting up the model parameters viz exponent of variable infiltration capacity curve b fraction of the maximum baseflow where non linear baseflow begins ds maximum velocity of the baseflow dsmax fraction of the soil moisture when non linear baseflow begins ws and depths of the second and third soil layers d2 d3 the calibrated parameters of the vic model are mentioned in table 1 subsequently the ecmwf forecasts of rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and wind speed were used in the parameterized vic model to simulate the lead time streamflow forecasts for this the vic model was run up to the time of the forecast using the historical and real time rainfalls and the necessary meteorological inputs to generate model state variables at the time of the forecast the calibrated vic model was run at a 30 days monthly window using i the historical era interim rainfalls for the past 25 days to generate the antecedent soil moisture condition for the study area and ii the ecmwf meteorological forecasts for the remaining five days to simulate streamflow with a lead time of 1 5 days the uncertainty associated with the ecmwf forecasts would get transmitted to the streamflow forecasts at 1 5 days lead time which can be improved by linking the vic model with the error forecasting model as described below 3 2 error forecasting models for updating the streamflow forecasts simulated by the vic land surface model an error model can be developed using the input error timeseries of ε t ε t 1 ε t d obtained during the model calibration phase where ε t is the simulation error between the observed qobs and vic simulated qsim discharges at any time t estimated as ε t qobs t qsim t and d is the effectively correlated time lag determined by the auto correlation function analysis of the error timeseries subsequently the error can be predicted at a forecast time level of α using the historical error series as 1 ε t α f ε sim t ε sim t 1 ε sim t 2 ε sim t d where f denotes the linear or non linear error forecasting models selected based on the hierarchical model complexity the details about these error correction models are described below 3 2 1 aru error correction model among the linear error updating models generally used for flood forecasting brath et al 2002 broersen 2007 bogner and kalas 2008 perumal et al 2011 the ar model is generally applied for updating the water level or streamflow forecast at smaller time step due to its simplicity the simple ar model could be mathematically represented as follows 2 ε t α a i i 1 d ε t 1 i e t α where ε qobs t qsim t simulated streamflow biases by the vic model used as exogenous inputs ε error simulated by the aru model e white noise d time delay for inputs which decides the order of the ar model and α lead time of forecast 3 2 2 armaxu error correction model as evaluated in different flood forecasting studies the application of the armax model has been found widely shamseldin and o connor 2001 brath et al 2002 broersen 2007 bogner and kalas 2008 this model is capable of incorporating exogenous input variables in addition to the autoregressive endogenous inputs expressed as 3 a q ε t α b q i 1 d ε t 1 i j 1 τ ε t α j c q e t α where d time delay for exogenous inputs used in the armax model τ time delay for endogenous inputs and a q b q and c q are the polynomials of the regression equation the degree of individual polynomials was decided by the trial and error approach 3 2 3 wnnu error correction model the wnnu error correction model is based on a mother wavelet function that constructs a family of wavelets of a finite interval morlet et al 1982 characterized by continuous and discrete wavelet transforms the non stationarity in the forecast error timeseries could be minimized with the wavelet based multi resolution analysis that decomposes the input data into approximate and detail components finally eliminating the noise signal to obtain the temporal and the spectral information contained in the simulation error timeseries data during the calibration period wavelet decomposition was carried out for decomposition of the error signals at level 5 the daubechies db2 wavelet function was employed which produces a low frequency sub signal approximation viz a5 and five high frequency sub signal details at different scales viz d1 d2 d3 d4 and d5 as shown in fig 4 for a typical case these wavelet components for each time lagged error series were analyzed using the correlation analysis to remove the weak signals from the original error series considering the correlation coefficients r 0 10 e g tiwari and chatterjee 2011 shoaib et al 2014 the most correlated signals were then added and the new error timeseries was used in the input layer of the wnnu model to forecast the lead time error ε t α the structure of a wnn model could be as shown in fig 3a 3 2 4 wnarx error correction model the wnarxu error model integrates the concepts of wnn and nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs narx models in which the input variables are pre processed by discrete wavelet transformation dwt to be used in the narx model nanda et al 2016 this hybrid wnarxu model could address the issues of non stationarity in the input data and catchment memory through multi scale dwt and autoregressive components of the outputs respectively in this study the wnarxu error model as shown in fig 3b uses the endogenous inputs in the form of the most recent historical biases as simulated by the standalone vic model εsim up to the current time level and recurrent exogenous feedback inputs of ε as predicted by the model during the pre forecast lead time levels these features of noise removal and short term autoregressive in the wnarxu model could be better utilized for higher lead time forecasting this wnarxu error model can be expressed as 4 ε wnarx t α f w ε sim t w ε sim t 1 w ε sim t 2 w ε sim t α 1 w ε sim t α 2 for any α time step ahead forecast the error can be forecasted by using the wnarxu model with a log sigmoid function in the hidden layer of the neural network as 5 ε t α 1 1 exp i 1 d ε t 1 i w i j 1 τ ε t α j w j where ε t α is the prediction error at α time steps ahead d is the effective time lag for the exogenous inputs of ε τ is the effective time lag for the endogenous recurrent inputs in the wnarxu model framework and w is the weight of the neuron subsequently for real time streamflow forecasting the lead time error forecasts predicted using the wnarxu error model can be used to update the discharge forecasts as fig 3 6 q t α q sim t α ε t α where q t α updated streamflow forecast qsim t α streamflow forecast as simulated by the standalone vic model with ecmwf meteorological forecasts and ε t α lead time error forecast as simulated by the error forecasting model 3 3 performance evaluation of the models first the rainfall estimates of the era interim and forecasts from ecmwf were compared with the gridded imd rainfall products as the benchmark using two skill measures of the correlation coefficient r and percentage bias pbias and two threshold statistics of probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far subsequently the flood forecasting performance of the models was assessed using five performance measure indices as i nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 ii correlation coefficient r iii mean absolute error mae iv percent error in volume evol and v uncertainty analysis in a situation where the rainfall forecasts are available the standalone vic model produces deterministic streamflow forecasts the predictive uncertainty pu associated with the vic error updating model variants can be estimated with certain probability of occurrence raiffa and schlaifer 2000 todini 2007 using the probabilistic post processing techniques krzysztofowicz and maranzano 2004 raferty et al 2003 seo et al 2006 reggiani and weerts 2008 recently for deterministic forecasts pu estimation weerts et al 2011 coccia and todini 2011 kumar et al 2015a barbetta et al 2016 2017 has been carried out using the quantile regression qr approach koenker 2005 this method requires estimating the relationship between the probability distribution of the errors and the forecasted values at a given lead time using the qr koenker and basset 1978 in this study the qr relationships were established using the streamflow forecasts and the associated errors residuals for each lead time of interest it is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the residuals ε and forecasts q in normalized form i e normalized discharge nq and normalized residual n ε koenker 2005 koenker and hallock 2001 weerts et al 2011 which can be expressed as 7 n ε i m nq i c where m and c are the slope and intercept parameters respectively i is the level of the data sample to carry out the regression analysis the sum of the weighted absolute residuals can be minimized using the objective function expressed as 8 m i n i m i z e i 1 n ρ β n ε i β m β nq i β c β where β desired quantile and ρ β quantile regression function that pushes ε i β to its desired location n no of data samples to describe the error distribution over different quantiles the qr programming functions quantilereg built in in the matlab package were used in this study using the calibration dataset the regression between n ε and nq was analyzed to obtain the regression lines for n ε β at every five percentile levels of β 5 10 15 95 the residuals in the gaussian domain n ε β at different quantiles were then converted to the original domain ε β the error quantiles were added to the forecasted discharge for obtaining the updated discharge at different quantiles as 9 q β t α q sim t α ε β the parameters m and c of the quantile regression equations were imposed on the forecasted streamflow with linear interpolation or if the forecasted streamflows were found outside the domain of the calibration dataset with linear extrapolation 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of the era interim rainfall product the era interim rainfall products for the selected study area were evaluated against the imd in situ rainfall products due to the tropical monsoon climate in the study area all the high flow events generally occur during july to september and hence the rainfalls occurring during 15th june to 15th october of 2000 2011 were selected for evaluation for analysis the monsoon rainfall timeseries rf t was divided into three threshold regimes of low medium and high as rf t µ µ rf t µ σ and rf t µ σ respectively where µ mean and σ standard deviation of the rf t timeseries as illustrated in fig 5 for the considered study period of 2000 2011 the era interim rainfall product tended to highly overestimate the low rainfall values with pbias 145 89 whereas the medium rainfall values show pbias 10 89 the heavy rainfalls were mostly underestimated with pbias 39 the pod and far analysis in fig 5 illustrates that the era interim rainfall product poorly captured the very high 95 percentile of 29 45 mm day rainfall events with a hit rate of 0 30 whereas it could not capture the peak storms of threshold magnitude of 60 mm day 4 2 evaluation of the ecmwf rainfall forecasts similarly for analysis of the mean areal ecmwf rainfall forecasts the monsoon rainfalls during the study period were divided into three threshold regimes of low medium and high rainfalls based on whether rainfall r µ µ r µ σ and r µ σ respectively where µ mean 9 07 mm day and σ standard deviation 11 49 mm day of the benchmark imd monsoonal rainfall products fig 6 depicts the bias estimates for the 1 to 5 days ahead ecmwf rainfall forecasts to capture the low medium and high rainfall threshold regimes as revealed in fig 6 the ecmwf rainfall forecasts at all the five lead times grossly overestimated the benchmark low rainfalls with pbias 83 whereas the high rainfall regimes were underestimated with 57 pbias 29 the medium rainfalls at 1 day lead time were overestimated by the ecmwf product with pbias 14 whereas these rainfalls were well estimated at higher lead times upto 4 days pbias 10 and underpredicted at 5 day lead time with pbias 16 similarly the pod and far analyses in fig 7 revealed that the 1 day and 2 day lead time ecmwf rainfall forecasts hit the 95 percentile rainfall 29 45 mm day by 50 and 30 times respectively and the hit rate decreased gradually at 3 4 and 5 days lead times with hit rates of 20 further it was found that the ecmwf rainfall forecasts failed to detect the high rainfall events above the threshold value of 95 percentile rainfall moreover the far estimates were very high for the high rainfall rainfall 95 percentile events with 0 6 and 0 7 at 1 and 2 days lead times respectively and far further increased to 0 75 for higher lead times of 3 5 days 4 3 performance of the standalone vic model for streamflow simulation the standalone vic model was calibrated separately with the era interim historical rainfall timeseries considering 2000 2007 as the calibration period in which the year 2000 was used for warming up the model to generate initial condition the calibrated vic model parameters while using the era interim rainfall inputs are listed in table 1 the model was validated for the period 2008 2011 fig 8 a illustrates the performance of the standalone vic during the calibration phase which revealed that the standalone vic model was well calibrated with nse 0 67 mae 586 64 m3 s and r 0 82 however the peak discharge events were mostly under predicted and some of the low flows were overestimated resulting in a large error in volume evol 8 since for flood forecasting the extreme streamflow events during the monsoon rainy season is of much interest in the study area the performance of the standalone vic model in simulation mode during the validation 2008 2011 period is illustrated in fig 8b moreover the corresponding mean areal rainfall for the catchment is shown in the secondary axis for the respective rainfall events the timeseries and scatter plots in fig 8b revealed that for the highly biased reanalysis rainfall inputs the performance of the standalone vic model in simulation mode reduced with the estimates of nse 0 45 r 0 70 mae 1375 26 m3 s and evol 16 50 this could be attributed to the high underprediction in the rainfall estimates for the corresponding high flow events hence it is expected that the impact of the high biases associated with the reanalysis rainfall product on the streamflows could be well addressed by hybrid models henceforth for real time flood forecasting the reanalysis rainfall was used as an input in the vic model for generating initial catchment state along with the use of ecmwf meteorological forecasts 4 4 performance of the standalone vic model in simulation mode with ecmwf weather forecasts fig 9 illustrates the timeseries and scatter plots of the streamflow forecasts at 1 to 5 days lead times by the standalone vic model using the corresponding lead time ecmwf meteorological forecasts of rainfall maximum and minimum temperatures and wind speed it can be surmised from fig 9 and table 2 that in forecasting mode the standalone vic model underestimated the discharge forecasts with nse 0 40 mae 1250 m3 s evol 30 and r 0 7 for 1 5 days lead time forecasts the poor performance of the standalone vic model during the forecast period could be attributed to the high biases in the ecmwf rainfall forecasts and or the insufficient initial soil moisture condition before the forecast day as generated using the reanalysis rainfall product of era interim hence the lead time streamflow forecasting using the vic standalone model is unacceptable 4 5 lead time inflow forecasting by the vic model in the error updating mode fig 10 illustrates the variation of autocorrelation functions of the error timeseries of the vic simulations with respect to different time lags it can be envisaged from fig 10 that the error time series significantly correlate r 0 4 up to a lag time of four days which was used in the error correction model further it can be visualized from figs 11 14 and table 2 that the streamflow forecasts by the vic aru vic armaxu vic wnnu and vic wnarxu model variants in the error updating mode were much improved than that of the standalone vic model at all the lead times as considered herein the linear vic aru and vic armaxu error updating models produced accurate forecasts up to 2 days lead time although its performance was unacceptable at 3 to 5 days lead times nse 0 50 the streamflow forecasting performance of the vic wnnu model was improved over the vic armaxu model for up to 2 days lead time at 1 day lead time the performance measures by the vic wnnu model were nse 0 82 r 0 91 mae 553 82 m3 s and evol 1 61 and at 2 days lead time these error measures were nse 0 77 r 0 90 mae 795 98 m3 s and evol 16 21 the vic wnarxu error updating model performed the best with the ranges of nse 0 76 0 88 r 0 88 0 94 mae 779 59 870 02 m3 s and evol 0 13 5 39 see table 2 overall the performance of the vic standalone and the three error updating model variants improved in the order vic standalone vic armaxu vic aru vic wnnu vic wnarxu signifying the superiority of the wnarxu error forecasting model the peak flow forecasting ability of the vic standalone vic aru vic armaxu vic wnnu and vic wnarxu models were also evaluated for the four typical observed annual maximum peak inflows of 18 156 m3 s 15 363 m3 s 9169 m3 s and 29 183 m3 s into the hirakud reservoir occurred during the years 2008 2009 2010 and 2011 respectively hereafter these four peak events are named as peak 1 2 3 and 4 respectively these peak flows were specifically responsible for severe flooding problem at the downstream reaches of the mahanadi river basin followed by improper reservoir operation due to lack of inflow forecasting at higher lead times table 3 shows the error in peak epeak estimates by all the model variants in reproducing the typical inflow peak floods at 1 to 5 day forecast lead times as compared to the vic standalone vic aru vic armaxu and vic wnnu models the peak flows were very well forecasted by the vic wnarxu model with epeak 20 in most of the cases even up to 5 days of forecast lead time the vic standalone model highly under predicted the peak flows with epeak 50 to predict the high discharge flow the large deviations between the observed and modeled data are clearly seen in the vic standalone vic aru vic armaxu and vic wnnu models with epeak 20 in most of the cases up to 5 days of forecast lead time see table 3 among the advocated error updating models the peak flood forecasting capability was improved in the order vic armaxu vic aru vic wnnu vic wnarxu e g fig 15 the results in table 3 and fig 15 evidenced that the semi distributed vic standalone forecast model could not perform efficiently for rainfall runoff transformation either due to the limitation in the model parameterization or due to the input data uncertainty in the ecmwf meteorological forecasts so that this model could not accurately forecast the streamflow even at 1 day lead time conversely the error updating models especially the wnarxu model could accurately forecast these associated errors with the base model and input ecmwf meteorological forecasts up to 5 days lead time the aru and armaxu models due to their linear framework failed to reproduce accurate lead time error forecasts in the wnnu and wnarxu error updating models the wavelet decomposition reduced the uncertainty in the prediction error arising from the non stationary hydro meteorological timeseries as well as the bias in the nwp forecast outputs moreover the dynamic nn based wnarxu model due to its autoregressive nature captured the memory of the catchment process at higher lead times to reproduce better error forecasts using the recent past feedback errors as model inputs however due to the absence of an autoregressive component in the wnnu model only the wavelet decomposition in the static nn framework could not perform well beyond 3 days lead time this could be the reason that among the error updating models the peak flood forecasting capability was improved in the order vic standalone vic armaxu vic aru vic wnnu vic wnarxu hence the output post processing of the model forecasts would be advantageous for discharge forecasting at higher lead time rather than conducting state updating at each forecasting time step further to test the capability of the vic wnarxu model for extended lead time forecasts simulations were carried out by this model for maximum up to 10 days lead times as the ecmwf meteorological predictions are available for only up to 10 days ahead the corresponding performance measures by the vic wnarxu model at 1 to 10 days forecast lead times are illustrated in fig 16 it can be envisaged from fig 16 that although the nse and r estimates do not drastically get reduced up to 10 days lead time the mae and evol estimates may only be acceptable up to 9 days lead time however in stricter sense considering nse 0 7 as the acceptable limit the vic wnarxu model may be applicable up to a forecasting lead time of maximum 7 days with the increase in the forecasting lead time from 6 to 10 days generally the error in the forecasted peak was increased slightly not shown here for brevity secondly the performance of the vic wnarxu model is mostly driven by the vic hydrological model the base model that considers all the catchment hydrological processes the wnarxu model accounts for the dynamic nature of error series integrating the concepts of ann wavelet transformation both endogenous and exogenous inputs and feedback of nonlinear recurrent inputs that make it a reliable and consistent error updating model therefore it is seen that unlike the other existing models the performance of the vic wnarxu model does not deteriorate drastically even at 10 days forecast lead time since the base vic model can account for the variability in hydro meteorological geographical conditions very well in its model framework as has been tested in many world river basins logically the vic wnarxu model can also perform very well in other world river basins in online forecasting mode the improvement in the inflow forecasting by the vic wnarxu model over the standalone vic model is highly significant for its implementation in a real time flood forecasting system although the standalone nn based data driven models could perform efficiently for discharge forecasting these fully black box models cannot account for the spatially distributed hydro meteorological inputs hydrological processes of streamflow generation and land use change effects in a catchment conversely the vic wnarxu error updating model retains the advantages of the catchment process based framework and the stochastic nature of the errors associated with the model and data uncertainties 4 6 assessment of predictive uncertainty pu of the error updating models to assess the uncertainty in operational flood forecasting by the developed error correction models quantile error models were developed the forecast timeseries by different model variants were analyzed for determining the quantiles β ranging from 0 05 to 0 95 to evaluate the performance of different models in terms of pu estimation the percentiles estimated by the qr method and the corresponding observed occurrences were compared as shown in fig 17 fig 17 illustrates the cumulated 0 05 5 estimated percentiles against the corresponding percentages of observed data that falls below each percentile where nobs i is the number of observations below each percentile i and n is the sample size the 1 1 line in fig 17 determines the perfect prediction and the underestimation or over estimation of the observed streamflows for a particular percentile is indicated by the deviations from the 1 1 line it can be found that in case of the forecasts by the vic standalone and vic armaxu models the qr estimated percentiles were smaller than the observed occurrences in the whole range of β 5 95 this indicates that the discharge timeseries estimated by these models were underestimated for the vic wnnu model the qr estimated percentiles were equal to the observed occurrences almost up to 50 however the observed occurrences were higher for β 50 95 this indicates that for the vic wnnu model the discharge timeseries corresponding to the 50 95 percentiles were underestimated which can be found in the hydrographs as shown in fig 13 the underestimation of the discharge forecasts by the vic standalone model was partially improved by using the vic wnnu error updating model it is found that for the vic wnarxu model the qr estimated percentiles almost fall on the 1 1 line which indicates that the qr estimated percentiles were same as that of the observed occurrences except for a small deviation in the high percentile flows as the forecasting lead time increased the higher deviation of the points from the 1 1 line indicates more discrepancies between the observed occurrences and the qr estimated percentiles the uncertainty in the vic wnarxu model was significantly reduced at higher forecasting lead times the ranges of the confidence interval ci bands for different model variants are shown in fig 18 the 90 95th 5th percentile and 50 75th 25th percentile ci bands for different model variants in fig 18 indicate that the average width of the ci bands varied in the order vic standalone vic armaxu vic aru vic wnnu vic wnarxu for both these cis as shown in fig 18 the average width of the 90 ci band varied in the ranges of 2745 3349 m3 s for the vic wnarxu model 3156 6143 m3 s for the vic wnnu model 4234 6329 m3 s for the vic aru model 4242 6394 m3 s for the vic armaxu model and 6409 6945 m3 s for the vic standalone model at 1 5 days lead time forecasts the higher width of the ci band indicates higher uncertainty associated with the vic standalone vic aru and vic armaxu models which were subsequently reduced in the vic wnnu and vic wnarxu models overall the vic wnarxu model was found to be robust in producing the forecasts with narrow ci band which would help in better decision making than solely using the deterministic forecasts during the multi purpose reservoir operation hence the reservoir inflow forecasting by the vic wnarxu model with uncertainty bands could successfully be employed for flood prone river basins world wide with the forcings of the ecmwf meteorological forecasts and the era interim rainfalls 5 conclusions for flood management it is necessary to have an efficient real time reservoir inflow forecasting system under limited hydro meteorological data availability conditions hence in this study a novel approach of the external wnarxu based error updating model was integrated with the vic land surface model to forecast the reservoir inflow well in advance at 1 to 7 day lead times the methodology developed herein was tested for real time inflow forecasting to the hirakud reservoir involving an extensive evaluation of the era interim rainfall products and the ecmwf meteorological forecasts as the model inputs based on the results this study concludes as follows 1 overall the ecmwf rainfall forecasts and era interim real time rainfall products could moderately reproduce the reference imd gauged rainfalls over the hirakud reservoir catchment both the ecmwf and era interim rainfall products were associated with low correlation and high bias signifying the need for systematic error updating when used in any rainfall runoff model operating in forecasting mode 2 the higher pod in the low rainfall regimes and high far in the high rainfall regimes indicated the randomness in the nwp errors in the ecmwf and era interim outputs 3 the standalone vic model with the ecmwf meteorological forecasts showed significant under prediction of the inflow forecasts at 1 to 5 day lead times this makes the standalone vic model unsuitable for operational flood forecasting and flood warning 4 the shortcomings in the standalone vic model forecasts forced with the ecmwf meteorological forecasts could effectively be addressed by the proposed error updating scheme using the vic wnnu model up to 2 days and the vic wnarxu model up to 7 days lead times the dynamic neural network structure of the wnarxu error model with the noise reduction property of the wavelet transform and the short term autoregressive features could effectively reduce the uncertainties in higher lead time streamflow forecasting using the nwp overall the accuracy in inflow forecasting has improved significantly with the increase in the model complexity in the order vic standalone vic armaxu vic aru vic wnnu vic wnarxu 5 for real time flood forecasting in data scarce regions the use of era interim rainfall products in the vic wnarxu model with ecmwf meteorological forecasts could be a realistic option overall the proposed vic wnarxu model could address the issue of reservoir inflow forecasting with sufficient lead times to be deployed in reservoir regulation system this could help in reducing the downstream flood havoc resulting from the improper reservoir operation declaration of competing interest the authors declare

6387,precise estimation of flow conveyance in a two stage open channel with vegetated floodplains is a key prerequisite to the management of the river ecosystem and the creation of flood retention space the presence of vegetation alters the structure of water flow and affects the discharge in a two stage channel nevertheless the effect of vegetation on flow conveyance is not studied separately in the previous flow discharge research by conducting force analysis in a control volume with considering the vegetation drag force and quantifying the energy loss caused by vegetation blocking effect and the transverse velocity gradient this paper proposes a new method to estimate flow conveyance in compound channel covered with vegetation based on the relationship which is the total energy loss is balanced by the total energy supplied by the local flow experimental data series are collected to verify the new method by comparing the measured and estimated discharges and it presents a good accuracy with 2 47 relative error the new method is also compared with the other methods which quantify the additional resistance of vegetation by using the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient the results indicate that both the vegetation drag force and the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient can be used in flow conveyance estimation and dominantly influence the accuracy of the predictive method so that they need to be properly quantified and calibrated and adopting the vegetation drag force is suggested here for the simplicity of calculation keywords compound channel vegetated floodplain flow conveyance energy balance energy loss vegetation drag force 1 introduction natural fluvial river channels are mostly two stage fig 1 and the flow structure of a two stage cross section is more complex than that of a simple river cross section in many circumstances there are many kinds of vegetation growing on the floodplains such as trees or bush lightbody et al 2009 tang and knight 2009 when the flood overtops banks and inundates riverine floodplains the presence of vegetation can change the hydraulic characteristics by increasing the overall resistance compared with non vegetated floodplains the vegetation alters the structure of water flow which has a great influence on the flow conveyance this adds difficulty for engineers who need to determine the flow conveyance for river channel management river training works or water resource activities fischer antze et al 2001 therefore studying the effects of vegetation on flow conveyance is the prerequisite for ecological river restoration and the creation of flood retention space researchers have paid considerable attention to predict the flow conveyance of two stage channels since the 1970s and proposed several methods to predict the flow conveyance prinos and townsend 1984 seckin 2004 the traditional single channel scm and divided channel dcm methods are used to predict the flow conveyance of compound channels based on manning equation without considering the momentum transfer interaction caused by the transverse velocity gradient thus the flow conveyance predicted by scm and dcm has significant deviation compared with the measured discharge several corrections have been proposed to modify the dcm with considering the momentum transfer interaction huthoff et al 2008 proposed a simple alternative the interacting dcm idcm which takes into account the influence of transverse momentum transfer by introducing a dimensionless interface coefficient bousmar and zech 1999 developed the exchange discharge method edm which estimates the transverse momentum transfer according to the lateral velocity gradient induced by the mass discharge swapped through the interface ackers 1993 established an empirical method called coherence method cohm based on the coherence conception to assess the flow conveyance in a two stage watercourse thereby considering the interaction effect induced by the mutation of the geometry of the river cross section using plenty of laboratory data sets actually coherence is defined as the ratio of the discharge calculated by scm to that calculated by dcm the shiono and knight method skm proposed by liao and knight 2007 is established from the analytical velocity model derived by shiono and knight 1991 which has three important coefficients to represent the influence of resistance factor eddy viscosity and secondary flow therefore the application of the skm is limited by the accurate current speed distributions whose accuracy is influenced by those three precisely calibrated coefficients azamathulla and zahiri 2012 derived a simple and empirical formula for flow discharge prediction in laboratory and natural river two stage open channels using the linear genetic programming lgp in fact lgp is an arithmetic for seeking the most best fit by dint of artificial evolution which was developed from biological evolution yang et al 2012 studied the relationship between momentum transfer and flow conveyance based on energy concept and proposed a simple but effective method called energy concept method ecm to estimate the flow conveyance in straight symmetric and two stage watercourse the differences of the methods described above have been listed in table 1 the first step in applying the methods described before is to calculate the basic flow conveyance in the deep main watercourse and on the floodplains using an appropriate traditional friction equation such as the widely used manning equation as shown below 1 q a r 2 3 n s 0 1 2 where q flow conveyance a and r cross section area and hydraulic radius respectively both depending on the flow depth bousmar and zech 1999 s 0 is the river channel bed slope and n is the manning s roughness coefficient which is a comprehensive empirical coefficient that reflects the effects of the river bed roughness boundary shape and other influencing factors for the floodplains partially or fully covered with vegetation the vegetation can induce additional blocking effect which augments the total flow resistance kouwen and unny 1973 conducted experiments and analyzed vegetation s biomechanical properties to study the flow resistance in channels covered with vegetation petryk and bosmajian 1975 believed that the roughness caused by rigid canopy is similar to that induced by large roughness elements such as hemispheres and gravels cowan 1956 developed a method to determine the value of manning roughness coefficient with considering the effects of some influencing factors these factors are 1 the type and size of the materials that compose the bed and banks of the channel and 2 the shape of the channel arcement and schneider 1985 proposed a guide for quantifying the values of manning s roughness coefficient for natural channels and densely vegetated floodplains the vegetation drag force and the manning s roughness coefficient are two common methods used to quantify the external resistance caused by vegetation according to table 1 it can be found that vegetation effect is not considered when those methods were proposed therefore engineers usually adopt the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient to calculate the discharge in compound channel with vegetation while applying these methods huai et al 2012 proposed an equation to quantify the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient in the open channel flow covered with vegetation in consideration of the secondary flow on the resistance of the vegetated area by an influence coefficient the equation can be described as 2 n v 1 k 1 a n 2 c d α v 2 a min h v h h 1 3 g π d where n v equivalent manning roughness coefficient k secondary flow influence coefficient a vegetation density c d drag coefficient α v shape factor h v vegetation height h water depth g 9 81 m s2 gravity constant and d vegetation diameter huai et al 2012 the value of k varies with a certain range and the empirical value is given here for a rectangular channel partially covered with vegetation k 0 to 0 30 for the compound channel partially covered with vegetation k 0 40 to 0 although the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient is often adopted in flow conveyance estimation it just simply reflects the resistance of vegetation on the riverbed rather than the entire water body it does not match the actual situation this study aims to introduce the vegetation resistance inside the water body to reflect the interaction between the main channel and the floodplains under the influence of vegetation more accurate thus this paper considers the vegetation drag force to conduct force analysis of a control volume and then proposes a new method to estimate flow conveyance in two stage river channel with vegetated floodplains based on energy balance the new method is validated by comparing published experimental data sets with the estimated discharges the new method performance is evaluated by error analysis and comparison with other methods which adopt the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 relation between energy and discharge bakhmeteff and allan 1945 studied the energy distribution transfer mechanism and dissipation process they derived the expression of the energy supply loss and transition at the cross section the results indicated that the local energy supply is balanced by the sum of energy loss and energy transition and the total energy transition of entire section is zero for a unit length in an open channel the energy supplied in one second can be described as 3 w tot γ j q tot where w tot the total energy γ the unit weight of water j energy slope which represents the energy supplied by a unit weight water along a unit flow path yang et al 2012 and q tot the total flow conveyance for a two stage river channel with vegetated floodplains energy loss and transition exist along the vertical and transverse directions because of the velocity gradient besides there will be another part of energy loss caused by vegetation according to the research results of bakhmeteff and allan 1945 the total energy transition of entire cross section is zero consequently w tot is equal to the sum of three parts of energy loss based on energy balance w tot can be written as 4 w tot w v tot w t tot w veg tot where w v tot the total energy loss along the perpendicular direction w t tot the total energy loss along the lateral direction and w veg tot the total energy loss induced by canopy therefore the total discharge can be rewritten by combining eqs 3 and 4 as 5 q tot 1 γ j w v tot w t tot w veg tot eq 5 reveals the relation between energy and discharge in a compound watercourse covered with vegetation a new method to predict the flow conveyance in the vegetated two stage watercourse can then be derived each part of energy loss in eq 5 is elucidated in the following sections 2 2 total energy loss caused by velocity gradient in consideration of an element in the compound open channel the elementary volume is deformed because of the existence of shear stress and depth averaged apparent shear stress gradient as illustrated in fig 2 the energy carried by the water body is lost when the water body overcomes the water flow resistance although the vertical distribution of longitudinal speed rate and the transverse distribution of depth averaged velocity distribution are different in the two stage open channel composed of vegetated and non vegetated floodplains the total energy losses along the vertical and transverse directions are similar however compared with the additional energy loss of a two stage river cross section composed of non vegetated floodplains that of a compound watercourse covered with vegetation is only caused by overcoming the resistance induced by vegetation therefore the calculation of the vertical and transverse energy loss can be conducted in the same way used in a compound channel with non vegetated floodplains the energy losses w v tot and w t tot are described as follows yang et al 2012 6 w v tot γ j q m q f 7 w t tot 1 4 v f v m h h f τ a m where q m the main channel discharge q f the floodplain discharge v m averaged velocity in the deep main watercourse v f averaged velocity on the floodplains and τ a m maximum apparent shear stress q m and v m q m a m a m is the flow area of the deep main watercourse are calculated by manning formula eq 1 the approach to compute the average velocity v f and discharge q f a f v f a f is the flow area on the floodplains is different from the way described by yang et al 2012 due to the existence of the vegetation on the floodplain accordingly v f should be calculated in consideration of the effects of different vegetation types yang and choi 2010 derived the flow speed rate averaged along the entire flow depth in a depth limited watercourse covered with submerged canopy for the emergent canopy flow the flow is transversely uniform and the velocity inside the vegetation layer can be spatially and temporally averaged white and nepf 2008 consequently for the submerged vegetation on the floodplains v f can be calculated by the formula proposed by yang and choi 2010 which is described as 8 v f 2 g h f s 0 a c d h v c u u κ ln h f h v h f h v h f where c u correction coefficient c u 1 for a 5 0 m 1 and c u 2 for a 5 0 m 1 u shear velocity at the vegetation height u g h f h v s 0 and κ von karman constant for the emergent vegetation on the floodplains v f can be computed by the equation in white and nepf 2008 which is described as 9 v f 2 g s 0 c d a the depth averaged apparent shear stress in the mixing zone has been studied on the basis of prandtl s theory of momentum transfer theory and the non dimensional analysis of the published laboratory data sets christodoulou 1992 huthoff et al 2008 moreta and martin vide 2010 tong et al 2003 wang et al 2007 different formulas to quantify the maximum apparent shear stress have been proposed by comparing these different methods yang et al 2012 recommended the model derived by moreta and martin vide 2010 due to its relative appropriateness and the model proposed by christodoulou 1992 because of its simplicity the model proposed by christodoulou is defined as 10 τ a m 1 2 ρ α d v m v f 2 11 α d 0 01 b b where ρ water density and α d momentum transfer coefficient 2 3 total energy loss caused by vegetation in the past few decades many researchers have paid considerable attention to study the effect of vegetation which is a significant segment of the river ecological constellation ghisalberti and nepf 2002 huai et al 2010 nepf and ghisalberti 2008 tang and hsieh 2016 nepf and ghisalberti 2008 indicated that the perpendicular transfer of mass momentum and energy are governed by two kinds of vortices in submerged vegetation flow namely the shear and stem scale vortices as illustrated in fig 3 a unlike in submerged vegetation flow the stem scale vortices fig 3b become the dominant factor that influences the transfer of mass momentum and energy in emergent vegetation flow the existence of the vegetation produces the general drag force which is described as 12 f d 0 h v z h f 1 2 ρ c d a u 2 z 0 z h v for submerged vegetation 13 f d 1 2 ρ c d a u 2 z 0 z h v for emergent vegetation where h v vegetation height for the flexible vegetation h v is equal to the average height when the canopy is deflected the drag coefficient is a key parameter to determine the general drag force numerous formulas to predict the drag coefficient have been proposed aberle and jarvela 2013 chapman et al 2015 sonnenwald et al 2018 tanino and nepf 2008 wang et al 2017 the formula derived by etminan et al 2017 to calculate the drag coefficient is described as 14 c d 1 10 r e c 2 3 where r e c reynolds number calculated by the flow speed rate at a constricted cross section u c d ν ν is the kinematic viscosity u c is the averaged flow speed rate in the constricted cross section u b 1 2 λ π λ is the solid fraction π d 2 4 0 5 l 2 l is the cylinder spacing u b is the bulk flow velocity q bh huai et al 2010 analyzed the mechanism of energy exchange in a river channel covered with submerged canopy and deduced the energy loss caused by vegetation drag force in a unit time interval based on eq 12 which is defined as 15 w veg 0 h v z h f ρ c d a v u 2 2 d x d z 1 d t u d t 1 2 ρ c d a u 3 u f d 0 z h v where a v is the facade area of canopy in the control volume therefore the control volume s energy loss in the emergent vegetation flow can be described as 16 w veg 1 2 ρ c d a u 3 u f d 0 z h f comparison of eqs 15 and 16 shows that the basic forms of the energy loss caused by submerged or emergent vegetation are similar for a two stage open channel flow with vegetation growing on its floodplains the total energy loss induced by vegetation can then be defined as 17 w veg

ρ c d a u veg 3 the entire cross section of two stage watercourse is divided into two parts the deep main channel zone and the shallow floodplain zone by the fictitious vertical interface planes which have been described by the dotted line in fig 1 the basic parameters to predict the flow conveyance in the two stage watercourse with vegetated floodplains are flow depth geometry of the compound channel manning roughness coefficient of the river bed vegetation density vegetation height vegetation diameter and channel slope it should be noted that manning roughness coefficient needs experimental observation and calibration the other parameters that appear during the calculation can be calculated by the basic parameters the calculation steps of flow conveyance are listed as follows i the zonal discharge and mean current speed in the deep main watercourse are determined with the manning equation ii the mean current speed on the shallow floodplain is quantified by using eq 8 or eq 9 and the zonal flow conveyance could be calculated by the floodplain area and the mean velocity iii the maximum apparent shear stress and the averaged vegetation drag force are determined iv the total discharge is determined using eq 20 3 verification and comparison 3 1 experimental data for analysis seven groups of experimental data series are collected from previous research to test and verify the new method these groups contain the symmetric compound channel case 1 fcf07 2 zhang et al 2017 and the asymmetric compound channel case 1 yang et al 2007 2 hamidifar et al 2016 3 mulahasan et al 2017 4 truong et al 2019 5 khademishamami et al 2014 data set of fcf07 are obtained from the web site www birmingham ac uk vegetation types in the seven sets of experiments include submerged and emergent vegetation the geometrical parameters and the vegetation characteristic parameters of these series are respectively listed in tables 2 and 3 to characterize the accuracy and effectiveness of the predictive method the relative error err and the averaged relative error er r ave are defined as 21 err q mea q cal q mea 100 22 er r ave 1 n i 1 n er r i where q mea measured discharge in the four sets of experiments q cal estimated discharge and n number of measured data 3 2 new method verification as mentioned in section 2 2 and 2 3 different formulas are proposed to calculate the momentum transfer coefficient α d and the drag coefficient c d therefore the seven sets of experimental data are divided into two groups the first group contains 1 fcf07 2 yang et al 2007 3 hamidifar et al 2016 and 4 mulahasan et al 2017 which is used to determine the appropriate formulas to quantify the drag coefficient and the momentum transfer coefficient the other three sets of experimental data are the second group to validate the result that is concluded from the comparison of first group the new method is validated by comparing its measured experimental data q mea with the predicted discharge q cal which are calculated by adopting different formulas to quantify α d and c d fig 4 presents the better comparison result that is computed by using eqs 11 and 14 fig 4 shows that q cal by the new method closely resembles q mea the new method can underestimate or overestimate the flow conveyance the error analysis shows that the maximum underestimation deviation is 6 80 q cal q mea q mea 100 and the maximum overestimation deviation is 4 70 q cal q mea q mea 100 the averaged relative error er r ave is 2 47 therefore the overall results confirm that the new method is a viable method to estimate the two stage watercourse with vegetated floodplains which is established based on the vegetation drag force and the formulas which are proposed by christodoulou 1992 and etminan et al 2017 to calculated α d and c d respectively have a better performance than others to further verify the conclusion above and the new method the second group of experimental data sets are compared with their corresponding predicted discharges fig 5 presents the comparison result that q cal also closely resembles q mea the maximum underestimation deviation is 5 73 and the maximum overestimation deviation is 10 36 the total averaged error er r ave is 5 18 although the total averaged error of the second group is larger than the first group s it still presents a relatively good accuracy the error analysis consequence means that adopting the formulas proposed by christodoulou 1992 and etminan et al 2017 to quantify the momentum transfer coefficient and the drag coefficient is appropriate during the calculation and the new method is available to estimate the flow discharge in the compound channel with vegetated floodplains 3 3 comparisons with other models the predicted results which are calculated by treating the vegetation effect as additional resistance to the riverbed are shown in fig 6 to compare the effectiveness of the new method with those of the other methods summarized in section1 and the first group of experimental data sets is chosen to be compared with the estimated discharges however the accuracy of the skm is governed by three crucial parameters which reflects the influence of bed resistance transverse shear and secondary flow knight 1999 and these three key coefficients need experimental observation to be calibrated so that they are difficult to be determined if the original experimental data cannot be collected accordingly the skm is not considered here to compare with the other methods according to the results shown in fig 6 both scm and dcm have a limited accuracy since they are not considering the momentum transfer interaction between the main channel and the floodplains therefore scm tends to underestimate discharge and dcm tends to overestimate it in contrast idcm and edm consider the momentum transfer interaction resulting in an improved accuracy so the interaction between the main channel and its floodplains has a great influence on the flow conveyance so the interaction between the deep watercourse and its floodplains has a great influence on the flow conveyance however a relatively large deviation exists in the results presented in fig 5d and 5e which are predicted by the lgp and the cohm respectively two possible reasons may explain the deviation one is the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient to represent vegetation resistance is unsuitable the other is that the two methods are proposed by empirical formulas based on analyzing plenty of laboratory data which cannot include all circumstances and for the experiment conducted by yang et al 2007 the predicted discharges by edm are considerably smaller than the measured data the reason is that the geometric shape of experimental two stage cross section cannot be classified into the standard two stage watercourse in their experiments the width of deep watercourse bottom is only 8 00 cm and the width of the mixing zone as illustrated in fig 2b is greater than 9 00 cm the mixing zone thus considerably affects the flow conveying capacity this deviation can also be found in the other methods in conclusion considering the vegetation blocking effect as the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient some of the above six methods scm dcm idcm cohm lgp edm can also have fairly good accuracy to predict the flow discharge therefore a reasonable quantification of the additional resistance induced by canopy is required the geometry of compound channel also considerably influences the accuracy of the estimated discharge 3 4 relative error analysis and discussion the relative errors of the seven methods are compared according to the calculated results to analyze the accuracy for evaluating the estimated method and the treatment of vegetation resistance the averaged relative errors are presented in fig 7 the averaged relative error of the new method is smaller than those of the other methods fig 7 for the data sets of fcf07 and hamidifar the averaged relative errors are similar which are predicted by the new method dcm idcm and edm as mentioned above we adopted two methods the vegetation drag force and the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient to quantify the vegetation blocking effect both the two treatment methods of the vegetation blocking effect are reasonable in flow conveyance calculation and can be used in the predictive model but the vegetation drag force can reflect the actual situation in terms of physical nature however for practical applications the key point is that manning s roughness coefficient and vegetation drag force need to be properly quantified and calibrated the total average relative errors of each method are 2 47 new method 31 73 scm 12 98 dcm 12 25 idcm 17 30 lgp 26 22 cohm and 23 11 edm if the relative errors of the experiment conducted by yang et al 2007 are not counted because of the larger deviation than others then the total averaged relative errors are 2 77 new method 18 45 scm 7 06 dcm 6 54 idcm 16 15 lgp 10 64 cohm and 7 98 edm from the statistics the new method and the idcm have a better performance than the other methods meanwhile compared to adopting the vegetation drag force to quantify the vegetation blocking effect there is one more parameter the secondary flow influence coefficient k in the process of calculating the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient what s more there are no formulas proposed in the previous research to quantify the secondary flow influence coefficient but only a few empirical values are recommended for reference so that it makes the calculation more complex consequently adopting the vegetation drag force is recommended here for the simplicity of calculation 4 conclusions because the vegetation is not considered in the previous methods that estimate the flow conveyance in compound channel and the vegetation is simply treated as the river bed roughness in practical use to introduce the vegetation drag force inside the water body this study considers the resistance effect of vegetation separately and quantifies the energy loss caused by vegetation and then a new method is proposed to predict the flow conveyance of a two stage watercourse with vegetation on its floodplains based on energy balance the new method is verified by comparing estimated discharges with collected experimental data sets and compared with the other methods which treat vegetation additional resistance as river bed roughness the following conclusions could be drawn from the analysis process and results 1 in two stage watercourse with vegetated floodplains the energy loss can be classified into three parts the energy loss along the vertical and lateral direction and the energy loss caused by the vegetation drag force the total energy loss is balanced by the total energy supplied by local flow 2 the verification result denotes that the new method can estimate the flow conveyance with a relative small error range 1 65 3 42 than other methods scm 15 93 52 88 dcm 2 99 22 46 idcm 4 45 21 40 lgp 5 70 23 36 cohm 6 32 51 14 edm 6 33 47 71 and adopting the vegetation drag force to quantify the vegetation additional blocking effect in predicting discharge is available 3 comparisons with other methods indicate that the two treatment methods for the vegetation additional resistance are available to calculate the flow conveyance but compared to the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient the vegetation drag force can reflect the actual situation which is vegetation additional resistance is not only on the river bed but also on the entire water body and some methods have similar accuracy to that of the presented new method on the basis of the statistics the new method proposed in this paper and the idcm are recommended here however to simplify the calculation the method of vegetation drag force is suggested here because of the complexity caused by the secondary flow influence coefficient in quantifying the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient 4 the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient and the vegetation drag force dominantly affect the accuracy of the predictive method and thus need to be properly quantified and calibrated the two variables deserve to be further studied to establish the predictive formulas with a great scope of application declaration of competing

6387,precise estimation of flow conveyance in a two stage open channel with vegetated floodplains is a key prerequisite to the management of the river ecosystem and the creation of flood retention space the presence of vegetation alters the structure of water flow and affects the discharge in a two stage channel nevertheless the effect of vegetation on flow conveyance is not studied separately in the previous flow discharge research by conducting force analysis in a control volume with considering the vegetation drag force and quantifying the energy loss caused by vegetation blocking effect and the transverse velocity gradient this paper proposes a new method to estimate flow conveyance in compound channel covered with vegetation based on the relationship which is the total energy loss is balanced by the total energy supplied by the local flow experimental data series are collected to verify the new method by comparing the measured and estimated discharges and it presents a good accuracy with 2 47 relative error the new method is also compared with the other methods which quantify the additional resistance of vegetation by using the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient the results indicate that both the vegetation drag force and the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient can be used in flow conveyance estimation and dominantly influence the accuracy of the predictive method so that they need to be properly quantified and calibrated and adopting the vegetation drag force is suggested here for the simplicity of calculation keywords compound channel vegetated floodplain flow conveyance energy balance energy loss vegetation drag force 1 introduction natural fluvial river channels are mostly two stage fig 1 and the flow structure of a two stage cross section is more complex than that of a simple river cross section in many circumstances there are many kinds of vegetation growing on the floodplains such as trees or bush lightbody et al 2009 tang and knight 2009 when the flood overtops banks and inundates riverine floodplains the presence of vegetation can change the hydraulic characteristics by increasing the overall resistance compared with non vegetated floodplains the vegetation alters the structure of water flow which has a great influence on the flow conveyance this adds difficulty for engineers who need to determine the flow conveyance for river channel management river training works or water resource activities fischer antze et al 2001 therefore studying the effects of vegetation on flow conveyance is the prerequisite for ecological river restoration and the creation of flood retention space researchers have paid considerable attention to predict the flow conveyance of two stage channels since the 1970s and proposed several methods to predict the flow conveyance prinos and townsend 1984 seckin 2004 the traditional single channel scm and divided channel dcm methods are used to predict the flow conveyance of compound channels based on manning equation without considering the momentum transfer interaction caused by the transverse velocity gradient thus the flow conveyance predicted by scm and dcm has significant deviation compared with the measured discharge several corrections have been proposed to modify the dcm with considering the momentum transfer interaction huthoff et al 2008 proposed a simple alternative the interacting dcm idcm which takes into account the influence of transverse momentum transfer by introducing a dimensionless interface coefficient bousmar and zech 1999 developed the exchange discharge method edm which estimates the transverse momentum transfer according to the lateral velocity gradient induced by the mass discharge swapped through the interface ackers 1993 established an empirical method called coherence method cohm based on the coherence conception to assess the flow conveyance in a two stage watercourse thereby considering the interaction effect induced by the mutation of the geometry of the river cross section using plenty of laboratory data sets actually coherence is defined as the ratio of the discharge calculated by scm to that calculated by dcm the shiono and knight method skm proposed by liao and knight 2007 is established from the analytical velocity model derived by shiono and knight 1991 which has three important coefficients to represent the influence of resistance factor eddy viscosity and secondary flow therefore the application of the skm is limited by the accurate current speed distributions whose accuracy is influenced by those three precisely calibrated coefficients azamathulla and zahiri 2012 derived a simple and empirical formula for flow discharge prediction in laboratory and natural river two stage open channels using the linear genetic programming lgp in fact lgp is an arithmetic for seeking the most best fit by dint of artificial evolution which was developed from biological evolution yang et al 2012 studied the relationship between momentum transfer and flow conveyance based on energy concept and proposed a simple but effective method called energy concept method ecm to estimate the flow conveyance in straight symmetric and two stage watercourse the differences of the methods described above have been listed in table 1 the first step in applying the methods described before is to calculate the basic flow conveyance in the deep main watercourse and on the floodplains using an appropriate traditional friction equation such as the widely used manning equation as shown below 1 q a r 2 3 n s 0 1 2 where q flow conveyance a and r cross section area and hydraulic radius respectively both depending on the flow depth bousmar and zech 1999 s 0 is the river channel bed slope and n is the manning s roughness coefficient which is a comprehensive empirical coefficient that reflects the effects of the river bed roughness boundary shape and other influencing factors for the floodplains partially or fully covered with vegetation the vegetation can induce additional blocking effect which augments the total flow resistance kouwen and unny 1973 conducted experiments and analyzed vegetation s biomechanical properties to study the flow resistance in channels covered with vegetation petryk and bosmajian 1975 believed that the roughness caused by rigid canopy is similar to that induced by large roughness elements such as hemispheres and gravels cowan 1956 developed a method to determine the value of manning roughness coefficient with considering the effects of some influencing factors these factors are 1 the type and size of the materials that compose the bed and banks of the channel and 2 the shape of the channel arcement and schneider 1985 proposed a guide for quantifying the values of manning s roughness coefficient for natural channels and densely vegetated floodplains the vegetation drag force and the manning s roughness coefficient are two common methods used to quantify the external resistance caused by vegetation according to table 1 it can be found that vegetation effect is not considered when those methods were proposed therefore engineers usually adopt the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient to calculate the discharge in compound channel with vegetation while applying these methods huai et al 2012 proposed an equation to quantify the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient in the open channel flow covered with vegetation in consideration of the secondary flow on the resistance of the vegetated area by an influence coefficient the equation can be described as 2 n v 1 k 1 a n 2 c d α v 2 a min h v h h 1 3 g π d where n v equivalent manning roughness coefficient k secondary flow influence coefficient a vegetation density c d drag coefficient α v shape factor h v vegetation height h water depth g 9 81 m s2 gravity constant and d vegetation diameter huai et al 2012 the value of k varies with a certain range and the empirical value is given here for a rectangular channel partially covered with vegetation k 0 to 0 30 for the compound channel partially covered with vegetation k 0 40 to 0 although the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient is often adopted in flow conveyance estimation it just simply reflects the resistance of vegetation on the riverbed rather than the entire water body it does not match the actual situation this study aims to introduce the vegetation resistance inside the water body to reflect the interaction between the main channel and the floodplains under the influence of vegetation more accurate thus this paper considers the vegetation drag force to conduct force analysis of a control volume and then proposes a new method to estimate flow conveyance in two stage river channel with vegetated floodplains based on energy balance the new method is validated by comparing published experimental data sets with the estimated discharges the new method performance is evaluated by error analysis and comparison with other methods which adopt the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 relation between energy and discharge bakhmeteff and allan 1945 studied the energy distribution transfer mechanism and dissipation process they derived the expression of the energy supply loss and transition at the cross section the results indicated that the local energy supply is balanced by the sum of energy loss and energy transition and the total energy transition of entire section is zero for a unit length in an open channel the energy supplied in one second can be described as 3 w tot γ j q tot where w tot the total energy γ the unit weight of water j energy slope which represents the energy supplied by a unit weight water along a unit flow path yang et al 2012 and q tot the total flow conveyance for a two stage river channel with vegetated floodplains energy loss and transition exist along the vertical and transverse directions because of the velocity gradient besides there will be another part of energy loss caused by vegetation according to the research results of bakhmeteff and allan 1945 the total energy transition of entire cross section is zero consequently w tot is equal to the sum of three parts of energy loss based on energy balance w tot can be written as 4 w tot w v tot w t tot w veg tot where w v tot the total energy loss along the perpendicular direction w t tot the total energy loss along the lateral direction and w veg tot the total energy loss induced by canopy therefore the total discharge can be rewritten by combining eqs 3 and 4 as 5 q tot 1 γ j w v tot w t tot w veg tot eq 5 reveals the relation between energy and discharge in a compound watercourse covered with vegetation a new method to predict the flow conveyance in the vegetated two stage watercourse can then be derived each part of energy loss in eq 5 is elucidated in the following sections 2 2 total energy loss caused by velocity gradient in consideration of an element in the compound open channel the elementary volume is deformed because of the existence of shear stress and depth averaged apparent shear stress gradient as illustrated in fig 2 the energy carried by the water body is lost when the water body overcomes the water flow resistance although the vertical distribution of longitudinal speed rate and the transverse distribution of depth averaged velocity distribution are different in the two stage open channel composed of vegetated and non vegetated floodplains the total energy losses along the vertical and transverse directions are similar however compared with the additional energy loss of a two stage river cross section composed of non vegetated floodplains that of a compound watercourse covered with vegetation is only caused by overcoming the resistance induced by vegetation therefore the calculation of the vertical and transverse energy loss can be conducted in the same way used in a compound channel with non vegetated floodplains the energy losses w v tot and w t tot are described as follows yang et al 2012 6 w v tot γ j q m q f 7 w t tot 1 4 v f v m h h f τ a m where q m the main channel discharge q f the floodplain discharge v m averaged velocity in the deep main watercourse v f averaged velocity on the floodplains and τ a m maximum apparent shear stress q m and v m q m a m a m is the flow area of the deep main watercourse are calculated by manning formula eq 1 the approach to compute the average velocity v f and discharge q f a f v f a f is the flow area on the floodplains is different from the way described by yang et al 2012 due to the existence of the vegetation on the floodplain accordingly v f should be calculated in consideration of the effects of different vegetation types yang and choi 2010 derived the flow speed rate averaged along the entire flow depth in a depth limited watercourse covered with submerged canopy for the emergent canopy flow the flow is transversely uniform and the velocity inside the vegetation layer can be spatially and temporally averaged white and nepf 2008 consequently for the submerged vegetation on the floodplains v f can be calculated by the formula proposed by yang and choi 2010 which is described as 8 v f 2 g h f s 0 a c d h v c u u κ ln h f h v h f h v h f where c u correction coefficient c u 1 for a 5 0 m 1 and c u 2 for a 5 0 m 1 u shear velocity at the vegetation height u g h f h v s 0 and κ von karman constant for the emergent vegetation on the floodplains v f can be computed by the equation in white and nepf 2008 which is described as 9 v f 2 g s 0 c d a the depth averaged apparent shear stress in the mixing zone has been studied on the basis of prandtl s theory of momentum transfer theory and the non dimensional analysis of the published laboratory data sets christodoulou 1992 huthoff et al 2008 moreta and martin vide 2010 tong et al 2003 wang et al 2007 different formulas to quantify the maximum apparent shear stress have been proposed by comparing these different methods yang et al 2012 recommended the model derived by moreta and martin vide 2010 due to its relative appropriateness and the model proposed by christodoulou 1992 because of its simplicity the model proposed by christodoulou is defined as 10 τ a m 1 2 ρ α d v m v f 2 11 α d 0 01 b b where ρ water density and α d momentum transfer coefficient 2 3 total energy loss caused by vegetation in the past few decades many researchers have paid considerable attention to study the effect of vegetation which is a significant segment of the river ecological constellation ghisalberti and nepf 2002 huai et al 2010 nepf and ghisalberti 2008 tang and hsieh 2016 nepf and ghisalberti 2008 indicated that the perpendicular transfer of mass momentum and energy are governed by two kinds of vortices in submerged vegetation flow namely the shear and stem scale vortices as illustrated in fig 3 a unlike in submerged vegetation flow the stem scale vortices fig 3b become the dominant factor that influences the transfer of mass momentum and energy in emergent vegetation flow the existence of the vegetation produces the general drag force which is described as 12 f d 0 h v z h f 1 2 ρ c d a u 2 z 0 z h v for submerged vegetation 13 f d 1 2 ρ c d a u 2 z 0 z h v for emergent vegetation where h v vegetation height for the flexible vegetation h v is equal to the average height when the canopy is deflected the drag coefficient is a key parameter to determine the general drag force numerous formulas to predict the drag coefficient have been proposed aberle and jarvela 2013 chapman et al 2015 sonnenwald et al 2018 tanino and nepf 2008 wang et al 2017 the formula derived by etminan et al 2017 to calculate the drag coefficient is described as 14 c d 1 10 r e c 2 3 where r e c reynolds number calculated by the flow speed rate at a constricted cross section u c d ν ν is the kinematic viscosity u c is the averaged flow speed rate in the constricted cross section u b 1 2 λ π λ is the solid fraction π d 2 4 0 5 l 2 l is the cylinder spacing u b is the bulk flow velocity q bh huai et al 2010 analyzed the mechanism of energy exchange in a river channel covered with submerged canopy and deduced the energy loss caused by vegetation drag force in a unit time interval based on eq 12 which is defined as 15 w veg 0 h v z h f ρ c d a v u 2 2 d x d z 1 d t u d t 1 2 ρ c d a u 3 u f d 0 z h v where a v is the facade area of canopy in the control volume therefore the control volume s energy loss in the emergent vegetation flow can be described as 16 w veg 1 2 ρ c d a u 3 u f d 0 z h f comparison of eqs 15 and 16 shows that the basic forms of the energy loss caused by submerged or emergent vegetation are similar for a two stage open channel flow with vegetation growing on its floodplains the total energy loss induced by vegetation can then be defined as 17 w veg tot 0 b f 0 min h f h v w veg d z d y 0 b f 0 min h f h v 1 2 ρ c d a u 3 d z d y b f 0 min h f h v 1 2 ρ c d a u 3 d z where b f is the width of the floodplain bottom yang and choi 2010 and white and nepf 2008 studied the current speed in submerged and emergent canopy layers they found that the flow velocity is nearly uniform and the formulas to estimate the averaged velocity have been defined as 18 u veg 2 g h f s 0 a c d h v for submerged vegetation flow 2 g s 0 a c d for emergent vegetation flow where u veg is the averaged current speed in the canopy layer the mean drag force and current speed are adopted to simplify eq 17 consequently the total energy loss caused by vegetation can be rewritten as 19 w veg tot 1 2 b f h v ρ c d a u veg 3 for submerged vegetation flow 1 2 b f h f ρ c d a u veg 3 for emergent vegetation flow 2 4 total discharge by combining eqs 6 7 19 and 5 the total discharge could be rewritten as 20 q tot q m q f 1 4 γ j τ a m h h f v m v f 1 2 γ j b f min h v h f ρ c d a u veg 3 the entire cross section of two stage watercourse is divided into two parts the deep main channel zone and the shallow floodplain zone by the fictitious vertical interface planes which have been described by the dotted line in fig 1 the basic parameters to predict the flow conveyance in the two stage watercourse with vegetated floodplains are flow depth geometry of the compound channel manning roughness coefficient of the river bed vegetation density vegetation height vegetation diameter and channel slope it should be noted that manning roughness coefficient needs experimental observation and calibration the other parameters that appear during the calculation can be calculated by the basic parameters the calculation steps of flow conveyance are listed as follows i the zonal discharge and mean current speed in the deep main watercourse are determined with the manning equation ii the mean current speed on the shallow floodplain is quantified by using eq 8 or eq 9 and the zonal flow conveyance could be calculated by the floodplain area and the mean velocity iii the maximum apparent shear stress and the averaged vegetation drag force are determined iv the total discharge is determined using eq 20 3 verification and comparison 3 1 experimental data for analysis seven groups of experimental data series are collected from previous research to test and verify the new method these groups contain the symmetric compound channel case 1 fcf07 2 zhang et al 2017 and the asymmetric compound channel case 1 yang et al 2007 2 hamidifar et al 2016 3 mulahasan

emergent vegetation the geometrical parameters and the vegetation characteristic parameters of these series are respectively listed in tables 2 and 3 to characterize the accuracy and effectiveness of the predictive method the relative error err and the averaged relative error er r ave are defined as 21 err q mea q cal q mea 100 22 er r ave 1 n i 1 n er r i where q mea measured discharge in the four sets of experiments q cal estimated discharge and n number of measured data 3 2 new method verification as mentioned in section 2 2 and 2 3 different formulas are proposed to calculate the momentum transfer coefficient α d and the drag coefficient c d therefore the seven sets of experimental data are divided into two groups the first group contains 1 fcf07 2 yang et al 2007 3 hamidifar et al 2016 and 4 mulahasan et al 2017 which is used to determine the appropriate formulas to quantify the drag coefficient and the momentum transfer coefficient the other three sets of experimental data are the second group to validate the result that is concluded from the comparison of first group the new method is validated by comparing its measured experimental data q mea with the predicted discharge q cal which are calculated by adopting different formulas to quantify α d and c d fig 4 presents the better comparison result that is computed by using eqs 11 and 14 fig 4 shows that q cal by the new method closely resembles q mea the new method can underestimate or overestimate the flow conveyance the error analysis shows that the maximum underestimation deviation is 6 80 q cal q mea q mea 100 and the maximum overestimation deviation is 4 70 q cal q mea q mea 100 the averaged relative error er r ave is 2 47 therefore the overall results confirm that the new method is a viable method to estimate the two stage watercourse with vegetated floodplains which is established based on the vegetation drag force and the formulas which are proposed by christodoulou 1992 and etminan et al 2017 to calculated α d and c d respectively have a better performance than others to further verify the conclusion above and the new method the second group of experimental data sets are compared with their corresponding predicted discharges fig 5 presents the comparison result that q cal also closely resembles q mea the maximum underestimation deviation is 5 73 and the maximum overestimation deviation is 10 36 the total averaged error er r ave is 5 18 although the total averaged error of the second group is larger than the first group s it still presents a relatively good accuracy the error analysis consequence means that adopting the formulas proposed by christodoulou 1992 and etminan et al 2017 to quantify the momentum transfer coefficient and the drag coefficient is appropriate during the calculation and the new method is available to estimate the flow discharge in the compound channel with vegetated floodplains 3 3 comparisons with other models the predicted results which are calculated by treating the vegetation effect as additional resistance to the riverbed are shown in fig 6 to compare the effectiveness of the new method with those of the other methods summarized in section1 and the first group of experimental data sets is chosen to be compared with the estimated discharges however the accuracy of the skm is governed by three crucial parameters which reflects the influence of bed resistance transverse shear and secondary flow knight 1999 and these three key coefficients need experimental observation to be calibrated so that they are difficult to be determined if the original experimental data cannot be collected accordingly the skm is not considered here to compare with the other methods according to the results shown in fig 6 both scm and dcm have a limited accuracy since they are not considering the momentum transfer interaction between the main channel and the floodplains therefore scm tends to underestimate discharge and dcm tends to overestimate it in contrast idcm and edm consider the momentum transfer interaction resulting in an improved accuracy so the interaction between the main channel and its floodplains has a great influence on the flow conveyance so the interaction between the deep watercourse and its floodplains has a great influence on the flow conveyance however a relatively large deviation exists in the results presented in fig 5d and 5e which are predicted by the lgp and the cohm respectively two possible reasons may explain the deviation one is the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient to represent vegetation resistance is unsuitable the other is that the two methods are proposed by empirical formulas based on analyzing plenty of laboratory data which cannot include all circumstances and for the experiment conducted by yang et al 2007 the predicted discharges by edm are considerably smaller than the measured data the reason is that the geometric shape of experimental two stage cross section cannot be classified into the standard two stage watercourse in their experiments the width of deep watercourse bottom is only 8 00 cm and the width of the mixing zone as illustrated in fig 2b is greater than 9 00 cm the mixing zone thus considerably affects the flow conveying capacity this deviation can also be found in the other methods in conclusion considering the vegetation blocking effect as the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient some of the above six methods scm dcm idcm cohm lgp edm can also have fairly good accuracy to predict the flow discharge therefore a reasonable quantification of the additional resistance induced by canopy is required the geometry of compound channel also considerably influences the accuracy of the estimated discharge 3 4 relative error analysis and discussion the relative errors of the seven methods are compared according to the calculated results to analyze the accuracy for evaluating the estimated method and the treatment of vegetation resistance the averaged relative errors are presented in fig 7 the averaged relative error of the new method is smaller than those of the other methods fig 7 for the data sets of fcf07 and hamidifar the averaged relative errors are similar which are predicted by the new method dcm idcm and edm as mentioned above we adopted two methods the vegetation drag force and the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient to quantify the vegetation blocking effect both the two treatment methods of the vegetation blocking effect are reasonable in flow conveyance calculation and can be used in the predictive model but the vegetation drag force can reflect the actual situation in terms of physical nature however for practical applications the key point is that manning s roughness coefficient and vegetation drag force need to be properly quantified and calibrated the total average relative errors of each method are 2 47 new method 31 73 scm 12 98 dcm 12 25 idcm 17 30 lgp 26 22 cohm and 23 11 edm if the relative errors of the experiment conducted by yang et al 2007 are not counted because of the larger deviation than others then the total averaged relative errors are 2 77 new method 18 45 scm 7 06 dcm 6 54 idcm 16 15 lgp 10 64 cohm and 7 98 edm from the statistics the new method and the idcm have a better performance than the other methods meanwhile compared to adopting the vegetation drag force to quantify the vegetation blocking effect there is one more parameter the secondary flow influence coefficient k in the process of calculating the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient what s more there are no formulas proposed in the previous research to quantify the secondary flow influence coefficient but only a few empirical values are recommended for reference so that it makes the calculation more complex consequently adopting the vegetation drag force is recommended here for the simplicity of calculation 4 conclusions because the vegetation is not considered in the previous methods that estimate the flow conveyance in compound channel and the vegetation is simply treated as the river bed roughness in practical use to introduce the vegetation drag force inside the water body this study considers the resistance effect of vegetation separately and quantifies the energy loss caused by vegetation and then a new method is proposed to predict the flow conveyance of a two stage watercourse with vegetation on its floodplains based on energy balance the new method is verified by comparing estimated discharges with collected experimental data sets and compared with the other methods which treat vegetation additional resistance as river bed roughness the following conclusions could be drawn from the analysis process and results 1 in two stage watercourse with vegetated floodplains the energy loss can be classified into three parts the energy loss along the vertical and lateral direction and the energy loss caused by the vegetation drag force the total energy loss is balanced by the total energy supplied by local flow 2 the verification result denotes that the new method can estimate the flow conveyance with a relative small error range 1 65 3 42 than other methods scm 15 93 52 88 dcm 2 99 22 46 idcm 4 45 21 40 lgp 5 70 23 36 cohm 6 32 51 14 edm 6 33 47 71 and adopting the vegetation drag force to quantify the vegetation additional blocking effect in predicting discharge is available 3 comparisons with other methods indicate that the two treatment methods for the vegetation additional resistance are available to calculate the flow conveyance but compared to the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient the vegetation drag force can reflect the actual situation which is vegetation additional resistance is not only on the river bed but also on the entire water body and some methods have similar accuracy to that of the presented new method on the basis of the statistics the new method proposed in this paper and the idcm are recommended here however to simplify the calculation the method of vegetation drag force is suggested here because of the complexity caused by the secondary flow influence coefficient in quantifying the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient 4 the equivalent manning s roughness coefficient and the vegetation drag force dominantly affect the accuracy of the predictive method and thus need to be properly quantified and calibrated the two variables deserve to be further studied to establish the predictive formulas with a great scope of application declaration of competing

6389,in order to deepen our understanding of water environment related issues in the central tianshan mountains tctms it is necessary to study the change processes of hydrological variables and the underlying mechanisms within a longer time window that goes beyond the instrumental period this study focuses on a high resolution lacustrine sediment core drilled from an alpine lake in tctms with a hope that palaeohydrological changes inferred from diatom assemblages may provide an insight on details of water environment evolutions the diatom inferred temperature was broadly consistent with the temperature records in its adjacent areas representing a temperature trough during 1490 to 1835 ce and a general rising trend since 1835 ce the diatom inferred ph di ph was generally low during 1490 to 1835 ce and was high with a declined trend during 1835 to 2013 ce being negatively correlated with tn or toc and positively correlated with carbonate in sediments significantly the diatom inferred conductivity di cond was characterized with a significantly high salinity interval during 1490 to 1835 ce than that during 1835 to 2013 ce the salinity during the past 520 years was modulated by interplays among precipitation driven by the atlantic multidecadal oscillations temperature dictated evaporation and temperature led glacier melting the water environment changes lakewater temperature di ph di cond and diatom assemblages were identified with a remarkable shift at 1835 ce when the temperature began to climb up in tctms implying that climate warming not only exerted influences on water resources but also on water properties in tctms keywords lake dalongchi diatom tianshan mountains paleohydrology amo 1 introduction the tianshan mountains are of particular importance for the arid central asia aca because they are the headwaters of several large rivers e g syr darya amu darya chu that nourish a large portion of human population in aca lauterbach et al 2014 shahgedanova et al 2018 it is sufficiently documented that the tianshan mountains have undergone through a significant warming in the past century at a rate that is faster than the mean rate of global warming ji et al 2014 ipcc 2014 and the temperature in the tianshan mountains was projected to continue the rising trend in the near future shi et al 2007 it was reported that the observed warming has reduced the effective soil moisture and expanded the areal extent of global drylands including aca via enhancing evaporation huang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 thus directly threatening the ecological security and economic sustainability of global drylands including aca ipcc 2014 the threat was tightly tied with warming resulted reduction in the size and number of the glaciers and those glaciers reduction will eventually lead to a decline of the associating water resource in the lowlands of aca chen et al 2016 sorg et al 2012 the central tianshan mountains tctms are equally important for xinjiang of china because they are the headwaters of several large rivers e g tarim yili manas that nourish nearly all of human population in xinjiang chen et al 2016 shen et al 2013 2018 wang et al 2010 xu et al 2010 they have been identified as an area particularly vulnerable to climate change for instance they are documented to have undergone through a significant warming in the past 60 80 years at a rate that is even faster than the mean rate of the entire tianshan mountains aizen et al 1997 chen et al 2016 marchenko et al 2007 the warming resulted glacial melting in tctms seemed to have prevented the projected water resource shortage from happening chen et al 2016 li et al 2012 xu et al 2010 however the projected continuation of glacial melting and associated shrinking will sooner or later reach a turning point the glacier supplied surface runoffs and associated water resources will definitely decline by then not only that but the climate changes and climate driving glacial fluctuations are always associated with changes of hydrological chemical and biological properties in water environment such as ph water temperature conductivity and biotic community preston et al 2016 those changes of water environment are crucial to local aquatic ecosystem therefore understanding the hydrological evolution processes and the associated evolutionary mechanisms play important roles in maintaining the aquatic ecosystem health water resource related issues in tctms have a certain degree of research chen et al 2016 deng and chen 2017 shen et al 2013 sorg et al 2012 xu et al 2010 for example tree ring and ice core studies in tctms and the surrounding areas have already produced some quite interesting results chen et al 2013 2015 kreutz and sholkovitz 2000 takeuchi et al 2014 however little is known about how do lakewater properties e g water temperature ph and conductivity respond to climatic changes and the climate driving glacial fluctuations in the climate sensitive alpine area for instance very few high resolution lacustrine records have been retrieved from the alpine lakes in tctms to speculate climatic characters and driving forces lauterbach et al 2014 mathis et al 2014 whereas variations of climate driving water properties were barely mentioned although lacustrine sediments were universally acknowledged to contain unique hydrological information that may not be obtained from tree rings and ice cores in order to deepen our understanding of the water resource and water environment related issues it is necessary to study variations of water environmental parameters and the underlying mechanisms within a longer time window that goes beyond the instrumental period here we conducted a paleolimnological study of lake dalongchi dlc in tctms during the past 520 years involving analysis of diatoms geochemistry and diatom based palaeohydrological reconstructions the goal of this study was to obtain a high resolution palaeohydrological evolution process and to extrapolate the underlying regulation mechanisms during the past hundreds of years such information will provide important insights into alpine hydrological responses to climate changes lending some supports to predicting future changes of water resources and managing water environment in tctms 2 study area lake dalongchi dlc 42 27 n 83 18 e 2400 m a s l a glacial moraine dammed alpine lake

climbing trends during 1958 2013 ce fig 2b c the observed warmest season peak runoff around lake dlc is mainly attributed to the warmest season precipitation and the observed spring mainly april and may peak runoff is attributed to temperature dictated glacier and snow melting shen et al 2013 wang et al 2010 3 sampling and methods 3 1 sampling and laboratory methods a 43 cm long core was

quantitative relationship of chemical reaction the samples 0 1 0 2 g each for diatom analysis were prepared according to the standard procedures defined by battarbee et al 2001 specifically a well defined quantity of polymer microsphere divinylbenzene was added to each sample to calculate the diatom concentration and the concentration is expressed as diatom grains per gram dry sediment st jacques et al 2009 species were identified and counted using an olympus bx 43 microscope under an oil immersion objective 10 100 magnification diatom identification was done with references to krammer

carbon reservoir effect a primary depth age model was established by using bacon age depth modeling packages blaauw and christen 2011 and then a linear regression analysis can be made by using mean ages calculated by the bacon age model at last an extrapolated age at the depth of 37 5 cm was obtained and the discrepancy between the bulk sediment based dates and the extrapolated dates at the depth of 37 5 cm was most likely resulted from carbon reservoir age of lacustrine bulk sediments ultimately a final depth age model was established based on the surficial date five wood plant residual dates and four carbon reservoir effect removed dates and the stratigraphic ages were eventually expressed in the form of common era i e ce fig 3 3 3 statistical analyses pearson correlation coefficients among variables were calculated using spss 22 0 software and constrained incremental sum of squares coniss cluster analysis for diatom was performed using tilia coniss software grimm 1993 diatom based transfer functions from the european diatom database initiative eddi http craticula ncl ac uk eddi jsp were used to infer lakewater ph and conductivity it should particularly be noted that we have validated the applicability of the transfer functions in the eddi to the diatom data obtained from lake dlc our validation showed that the similarities between lake dlc and the eddi training set were 75 in most samples indicating that the eddi transfer functions were applicable to lake dlc for paleoenvironmental interpretation of diatom data we compared several commonly used optional approaches including classic inversed weighted averaging wa and classic inversed locally weighted weighted averaging rantala et al 2015 our comparison showed that waclassic approach produced high jackknifed r2 value r2 jackknife low root mean squared error of prediction rmsep and the lowest maximum bias max bias thus waclassic approach was employed for paleoenvironmental reconstructions in this study in details the performance of diatom inferred ph di ph was r2 jackknife 0 76 rmsep 0 51 max bias 0 14 and the performance of diatom inferred conductivity di cond was r2 jackknife 0 77 rmsep 0 48 max bias 0 51 di ph and di cond were calculated with ernie software 1 0 juggins 2001 4 results 4 1 chronology based on field observations and grain size data e g md the core was lithologically composed of alternations between grayish clayey silt layers and yellowish sandy silt layers fig 3 md slightly varied between 10 and 30 μm indicating a relative weak hydrodynamic condition and a relative stable sedimentary environment five wood plant residual samples and four bulk sediment samples were ams 14c dated table 1 two notes need mentioning before establishing the needed depth age model first the 14c age at the depth of 28 5 cm i e post bomb was rejected and the rejection was based on two older dates at two overlying stratigraphic positions i e 140 30 yr bp at the depth of 13 5 cm and 160 30 yr bp at the depth of 19 5 cm second four bulk sediment based dates from the lower stratigraphic positions are too old in comparison with the corresponding ages that were linearly extrapolated from the surface date and wood plant residue based dates of upper stratigraphic positions implying a remarkable carbon reservoir effect in details a linear regression equation age 5 966 depth 63 r2 0 99 was obtained thus the linearly extrapolated age was 161 yr bp at 37 5 cm the carbon reservoir age i e 1059 yr can be defined as the discrepancy between the bulk sediment based dates 1220 yr bp and the extrapolated dates at the depth of 37 5 cm 161 yr bp in addition the different value between two 14c dates with without carbon reservoir effect at the depth of 37 5 cm i e 1150 yr also proximately supported the aforementioned carbon reservoir age i e 1059 yr table 1 4 2 diatom flora a total of 155 diatom species were identified from the lake dlc core and 28 of them were relatively abundant fig 4 each of the 28 species must have occurred in at least two samples and the relative abundance must be 3 among the 28 diatom species cyclotella ocellata a freshwater species and achnanthes minutissima a fresh brackish species were the absolutely dominant species with their maximum relative abundances exceeding 50 for the purpose of interpreting the diatom spectrum diatoms were classified into three eco groups according to the living forms van dam et al 1994 wilson et al 1994 kashima et al 1997 they were freshwater types including fragilaria amphora cyclotella and navicula cryptocephala fresh brackish types including a minutissima cocconeis placentula var euglypta denticula kuetzingii diatoma moniliforme diploneis oculata gyrosigma acuminatum hantzschia amphioxys navicula menisculus and nitzschia and brackish types including navicula cincta navicula pygmaea navicula veneta nitzschia frustulum and surirella brebissonii based on the results of coniss analysis the diatom spectrum can be categorized into two major assemblage units diatom unit 1 and 2 fig 4 diatom unit 1 was characterized by the appearing of the large number of brackish species e g n cincta n veneta and n frustulum and can be further divided into four sub units diatom sub unit 1 1 43 39 cm 1490 to 1539 ce was singled out by a high abundance of a minutissima a fresh brackish species freshwater species e g fragilaria pinnata amphora inariensis cyclotella comta and cyclotella distinguenda var unipunctata and brackish species e g n cincta n pygmaea n veneta and n frustulum were moderately present diatom sub unit 1 2 39 33 cm 1539 to 1610 ce represented a swift shift from a high abundance of a minutissima a fresh brackish species in sub unit 1 1 to a high abundance of c ocellata a freshwater species that was accompanied by c comta and cyclotella pseudostelligera also freshwater species it was notable that brackish species e g n cincta and n veneta and fresh brackish species e g g acuminatum and h amphioxys were also relatively abundant diatom sub unit 1 3 33 25 cm 1610 to 1702 ce was characterized by the highest abundances of brackish species e g n cincta n veneta n frustulum and s brebissonii the highest abundances of brackish species were accompanied with rather low abundances of two dominant species of the entire core c ocellata a freshwater species and a minutissima a fresh brackish species diatom sub unit 1 4 25 14 cm 1702 to 1835 ce was absolutely dominated by a minutissima a fresh brackish species with its highest abundance of 55 4 some of freshwater species e g fragilaria and n cryptocephala were moderately present and some brackish species e g n cincta n veneta and n frustulum were detectably present diatom unit 2 was typified by an absolute domination of c ocellata a freshwater species and can be further divided into two sub units diatom sub unit 2 1 14 5 cm 1835 to 1944 ce was characterized by the highest abundance of c ocellata a freshwater species one of two core dominating species other freshwater species e g amphora cyclotella and n cryptocephala were also well present it was quite notable that one of two core dominating species a minutissima a fresh brackish species reached its lowest abundance of the entire core accompanied with the lowest abundance of a minutissima diatom assemblages were also presented with merely detectable amounts of other fresh brackish species and nearly complete disappearance of brackish species diatom sub unit 2 2 5 0 cm 1944 to 2013 ce was typified by a considerable increase in the abundance of fresh brackish species e g a minutissima c placentula var euglypta and d oculata at the expense of c ocellata a freshwater species it was also notable that brackish species e g n pygmaea n veneta n frustulum and s brebissonii were moderately present 4 3 ordination of diatom assemblages and the reconstructions a biplot of pca for the main diatom taxa is shown on fig 5 a diatom pca axis 1 dia pca 1 explained 63 of the total variance and diatom pca axis 2 dia pca 2 explained 18 on dia pca 1 high sample score values were associated with cyclotella genus including c ocellata c pseudostelligera c comta and c quadrijuncta on the other hand low sample score values on dia pca 1 were concerned with a minutissima and n cryptocephala fig 5a many kinds of cyclotella genus belong to alkaliphilous species which widely distributed in ph 7 water body smol and stoermer 2010 especially c ocellata a common species in high alkalinity lake anderson et al 2012 whereas a minutissima and n cryptocephala belong to circumneutral species which widely distributed in ph 7 water body van dam et al 1994 thus the dia pca 1 may represent a gradient of ph in lakewater on dia pca 2 high sample scores were associated with freshwater species such as a minutissima and c placentula var euglypta whereas low sample scores were associated with brackish species such as n cincta n veneta n frustulum cumming and smol 1993 gasse 1987 kashima et al 1997 wilson et al 1994 thus the dia pca 2 may refer to a conductivity or salinity gradient the speculations can be demonstrated by the significant correlations between pca axis scores and palaeohydrological reconstructions as well as the proximity between reconstructions of the surface sample and the instrumental data fig 5b c that is dia pca 1 was highly correlated with di ph r 0 96 p 0 01 while dia pca 2 was significantly correlated with di cond r 0 72 p 0 01 di ph was generally low in zone 1 and showed generally high values with a declined trend in zone 2 fig 5b di cond was frequently fluctuated in zone 1 with obviously high values during 1540 to 1700 ce and represented a trough in zone 2 fig 5c 4 4 geochemical analysis results of the geochemical analysis are presented in fig 6 in general particle size related parameters varied much similar or totally inverse the median diameter md in the sediments ranged between 7 1 and 31 9 μm mean 15 9 μm it was nearly parallel with sand content whereas it was opposite with the trends of silt and clay carbonate fluctuated between 9 8 and 27 4 mean 20 0 it was generally low with an average value of 18 8 in zone 1 whereas it increased to a higher level with an average value of 22 6 in zone 2 toc varied between 12 9 and 82 2 mg g mean 38 8 mg g while tn varied between 0 8 and 5 1 mg g mean 2 1 mg g throughout the core toc and tn displayed similar stratigraphic fluctuations showing a generally high level with frequently fluctuations in zone 1 and a generally low level in zone 2 c n ratio varied between 8 8 and 16 9 mean 11 6 being generally higher than 10 throughout the core fig 6 5 discussion 5 1 temperature variations and underlying mechanisms some diatoms were reported to be sensitive to lakewater temperature battarbee et al 2001 bigler et al 2002 rühland et al 2003 smol and stoermer 2010 for example the abundance of small benthic fragilaria species was repeatedly reported to be respondent to the time length of ice cover that in turn modulates by lakewater temperature in alpine area karst riddoch et al 2005 lotter and bigler 2000 smol et al 2005 that is the higher the abundance of the small benthic fragilaria species fragilaria achieved the lower the lakewater temperature was therefore we adopted fragilaria as an indicator of lakewater temperature in dlc sediment core it has been widely accepted that the changes in the total solar irradiance fig 7a steinhilber et al 2012 and also in the atmospheric co2 concentration fig 7b robertson et al 2001 have driven the temperature anomalies of the past millennium in the northern hemisphere nh fig 7c mann et al 2009 the latter half of the past millennium i e the past 500 years was climatologically divided into two major intervals the little ice age lia 1450 to 1850 ce and the current warm period cwp 1850 ce present the nh temperature anomalies of the past 500 years were reasonably responded by two well regarded temperature proxy records retrieved from two sites in the core area of eurasian continent the δ18o of belukha ice core in the altay mountains fig 7 d site 3 in fig 1a and the alkane index i e u 37 k of lake manas in the junggar basin fig 7e site 4 in fig 1a specifically both of the δ18o of ice core and the u 37 k were tested to be acceptable temperature proxies aizen et al 2016 eichler et al 2009 he et al 2013 song et al 2015 toney et al 2010 and both proxy records documented the lia and the cwp our temperature proxy record i e fragilaria of dlc core in tctms fig 7f seems to be the third acceptable temperature proxy record from the core area of eurasian continent stretching from the altay mountains in the north through the junggar basin in the middle to the tianshan mountains in the south again our temperature proxy record i e fragilaria of dlc core seemed to have documented the nh temperature anomalies of the past 500 years that is the temperature was moderate during 1490 to 1590 ce was generally low during 1590 to 1835 ce with the coldest interval spanning from 1680 to 1800 ce and was generally high since 1835 ce it should be important to note that the climbing atmospheric co2 concentration partly accounted for the high level of temperature during cwp 5 2 lakewater ph variations and underlying mechanisms lakewater ph is an important hydrological variable in water body and modulates the composition and structure of biotic community battarbee et al 2001 thus understanding the driving mechanisms of ph variation is vital to aquatic ecology here we adopt pearson correlation analysis among lakewater and sedimentary variables to seek the underlying mechanisms of ph fluctuation table 2 results indicated that di ph was the most significantly negative correlation with tn r 0 54 p 0 01 as well as di ph and toc r 0 52 p 0 01 during geochemical zone 1 tn and toc were generally high corresponding to a relative lower di ph during geochemical zone 2 tn and toc varied at a low level corresponding a higher di ph fig 5 fig 6 these coincidences implied that tn and toc in sediments may be the underlying factors which are likely to affect lakewater ph variations fitting relationship between di ph and tn was further analyzed as well as that between di ph and toc in the dlc sediment core the fitting formulas were di ph 7 39 0 26 ln tn 0 79 r2 0 52 or di ph 8 37 0 30 ln toc 9 63 r2 0 36 fig 8 in general di ph declined with the increase of tn and toc content an increase of nitrogen input represents the loss of watershed acid neutralizing capacity and an increase of toc in sediments means an increase of organic acid input therefore abundant inputs of tn or toc may trigger a significant acidification of lakewater ultimately laudon et al 2000 baron et al 2011 especially in the alpine area e g lake dlc where the ecosystems are much vulnerable to environmental changes grimm et al 2013 large area snowmelt may greatly increase nitrogen and organic acids inputs of watersheds and the inputs may even contribute over 75 of the acidity variation in some cases laudon et al 2000 moreover di ph was coordinated change with carbonate showing a positive correlation r 0 37 p 0 05 based on table 2 it agrees with the basic rule of carbonate deposition that high ph can effectively encourage carbonate precipitation in freshwater the aforementioned relationships will help us to understand the contributions of multiple environmental factors on ph variations within a long time scale facilitating the researches on evolutionary history of paleohydrology to ensure the aquatic ecology safety in the alpine areas 5 3 salinity variations and underlying mechanisms as an alpine lake in the middle northern latitudes di cond of lake dlc a reflection of lakewater salinity or lake level should have responded not only to the changes in climate e g precipitation and temperature but also to the changes in glaciers e g ice melting amount climatologically speaking the atlantic multidecadal oscillations amo was proposed to have strongly affected the westerly downstream areas including the core area of eurasian continent stretching from the altay mountains to the tianshan mountains chen et al 2013 kalra et al 2013 lan et al 2018b lu et al 2006 sun et al 2015 the amo strength was demonstrated to have dictated the warm season precipitation in southern siberia including the altay mountains swp in fig 9 a sun et al 2015 during the past 110 years and also seemingly to have modulated the warm season precipitation at the bayanbulak weather station bwp in fig 9a in tctms during the past 60 years if the instrument record documented tight in phase relationship between the amo strength and the amount of warm season precipitation in the core area of eurasian continent was maintained during the past 500 years the amo strength curve fig 9b can then be used as the regional precipitation proxy curve for tctms where the lake dlc is situated in subsequently the variations in precipitation fig 9b temperature fig 9c fragilaria in lake dlc core and fluctuations of glacier fig 9d were thereby employed to explain the basin moisture variation fig 9e tree ring reconstructed pdsi at site 6 in fig 1a and the di cond variations of lake dlc core fig 9f as shown in fig 9f the di cond exhibited five stages of variations i e stagesⅰ ⅱ iii iv and ⅴ which were approximately correspondent with the aforementioned diatom sub units followings are our explanations of the variations in the lakewater salinity fig 9f with a full consideration of the variations in precipitation temperature and fluctuation of glacier fig 9 b d salinity stageⅰ 1490 to 1540 ce being correspondent with the diatom sub unit 1 1 was characterized by a moderate to low level of the lakewater salinity and occurred under a condition with moderately high precipitation and moderate temperature salinity stage ⅱ 1540 to 1700 ce being correspondent with the diatom sub units 1 2 and 1 3 was manifested by the lowest basin moisture and the highest salinity this situation was most likely resulted from the extremely low precipitation although the temperature was averagely low salinity stage iii 1700 to 1835 ce being correspondent with the diatom sub unit 1 4 was typified by a generally high basin moisture and a stably moderate level of the salinity associating with relatively high precipitation and extremely low temperature it was quite notable that the massively advanced glaciers in the hexilegen pass site 5 in fig 1a and the higher pdsi of hutubi site 6 in fig 1a during this time interval were probably due to high precipitation evaporation ratio under the climatic condition at stage iii chen 1989 li et al 2016 how it was possible to sustain a moderately low lakewater salinity under such climatic condition this may be likely to attribute to hydrologic compensation that is high precipitation should theoretically compensate for the water deficit of lake dlc which inherited from the previous longtime dry period first therefore high precipitation may remarkably promote the basin moisture but it may not significantly change the lake level and the associated lakewater salinity although the rainfall was quite plentiful during this stage salinity stage ⅳ 1835 to 1945 ce being correspondent with the diatom sub unit 2 1 recorded a declined basin moisture but the lowest salinity compared with the variations of climatic condition and basin moisture the stage ⅳ should have a higher level of the salinity under a condition with slightly lowered precipitation proxy values and considerably elevated temperature proxy values in fact the salinity during the stage ⅳ reached the lowest level of the entire core and it was most likely associated more with the fragilaria documented temperature see fig 9c than with the amo index suggested precipitation that is the lowest salinity might have been caused by temperature rising resulted melting of glaciers that advanced massively during the preceding stage i e stage iii thus the diatom flora shifted dramatically at this stage for instance cyclotella genus which favor warmer freshwater environments bloomed smol 2010 whereas n cincta n veneta and n frustulum usually occur in more saline waterbodies nearly disappeared at this stage cumming and smol 1993 gasse 1987 kashima et al 1997 wilson et al 1994 salinity stage ⅴ 1945 to 2013 ce being correspondent with the diatom sub unit 2 2 has a relatively high basin moisture and a low level of the salinity the relatively low level can be attributable to the increase in precipitation and also to increase in glacier melting water under a rising temperature condition during the past 70 years it should be particularly noted that the increases in both precipitation and temperature during the past 70 years was not only reflected in the proxy records see fig 9b c but also was instrumentally recorded at the nearby bayanbulak weather station and many other stations in xinjiang of china chen et al 2016 li et al 2012 xu et al 2010 to sum up the water environment changes involving hydrological chemical and biological properties of lakewater in lake dlc lakewater temperature di ph di cond and diatom assemblages were identified with a remarkable shift at 1835 ce when the temperature began to climb up to a high level in tctms thus 1835 ce is an important time node of water environment changes in tctms climatologically speaking it also roughly corresponded to the boundary timeline between the lia and the cwp it implied that climate warming as an original climatic driving force not only affected water resource variations but also further exerted influences on variations of water properties in tctms this study provides some insights into hydrological variations lakewater temperature di ph di cond and diatom assemblages responding to climate changes in alpine area more details of interactions among multiple factors originating from atmosphere basin and lake should be revealed deepening our understanding on aquatic ecosystem responses under continuing global warming scenarios in the future 6 conclusions based on aforementioned results and discussion following conclusions can be drawn 1 temperature variations have displayed a good consistency in tctms and the adjacent areas in this study fragilaria indicated temperature of lake dlc was moderate from 1490 to 1590 ce relatively low with large amplitude fluctuations from 1590 to 1835 ce with the coldest interval spanning from 1680 to 1800 ce and averagely higher with a general rising trend since 1835 ce the temperature variation in tctms was a reflection of the nh temperature anomaly being primarily driven by the total solar irradiance and the atmospheric co2 concentration 2 di ph was generally low during 1490 to 1835 ce and exhibited a generally high level with a slightly declined trend during 1835 to 2013 ce in general di ph declined with the increasing inputs of tn or toc and increased with carbonate content being significantly correlated with tn toc or carbonate in sediments based on fitting calculations di ph 7 39 0 26 ln tn 0 79 r2 0 52 or di ph 8 37 0 30 ln toc 9 63 r2 0 36 3 the variations of di cond in lake dlc during the past 520 years have been modulated by interplays among three factors the amo driven precipitation temperature dictated evaporation and temperature led glacier melting the lakewater salinity variations were inconsistent with reginal precipitation during 1835 to 1945 ce were likely caused by temperature rising resulted melting of glaciers that advanced massively during the preceding period i e 1700 to 1835 ce 4 the water environment changes lakewater temperature di ph di cond and diatom assemblages of lake dlc were identified with a remarkable shift at 1835 ce when the nh temperature began to climb up to a high level

6389,in order to deepen our understanding of water environment related issues in the central tianshan mountains tctms it is necessary to study the change processes of hydrological variables and the underlying mechanisms within a longer time window that goes beyond the instrumental period this study focuses on a high resolution lacustrine sediment core drilled from an alpine lake in tctms with a hope that palaeohydrological changes inferred from diatom assemblages may provide an insight on details of water environment evolutions the diatom inferred temperature was broadly consistent with the temperature records in its adjacent areas representing a temperature trough during 1490 to 1835 ce and a general rising trend since 1835 ce the diatom inferred ph di ph was generally low during 1490 to 1835 ce and was high with a declined trend during 1835 to 2013 ce being negatively correlated with tn or toc and positively correlated with carbonate in sediments significantly the diatom inferred conductivity di cond was characterized with a significantly high salinity interval during 1490 to 1835 ce than that during 1835 to 2013 ce the salinity during the past 520 years was modulated by interplays among precipitation driven by the atlantic multidecadal oscillations temperature dictated evaporation and temperature led glacier melting the water environment changes lakewater temperature

arid central asia aca because they are the headwaters of several large rivers e g syr darya amu darya chu that nourish a large portion of human population in aca lauterbach et al 2014 shahgedanova et al 2018 it is sufficiently documented that the tianshan mountains have undergone through a significant warming in the past century at a rate that is faster than the mean rate of global warming ji et al 2014 ipcc 2014 and the temperature in the tianshan mountains was projected to continue the rising trend in the near future shi et al 2007 it was reported that the observed warming has reduced the effective soil moisture and expanded the areal extent of global drylands including aca via enhancing evaporation huang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 thus directly threatening the ecological security and economic sustainability of global drylands including aca ipcc 2014 the threat was tightly tied with warming resulted reduction in the size and number of the glaciers and those glaciers reduction will eventually lead to a decline of the associating water resource in the lowlands of aca chen et al 2016 sorg et al 2012 the central tianshan mountains tctms are equally important for xinjiang of china because they are the headwaters of several large rivers e g tarim yili manas that nourish nearly all of human population in xinjiang chen et al 2016 shen et al 2013 2018 wang et al 2010 xu et al 2010 they have been identified as an area particularly vulnerable to climate change for instance they are documented to have undergone through a significant warming in the past 60 80 years at a rate that is even faster than the mean rate of the entire tianshan mountains aizen et al 1997 chen et al 2016 marchenko et al 2007 the warming resulted glacial melting in tctms seemed to have prevented the projected water resource shortage from happening chen et al 2016 li et al 2012 xu et al 2010 however the projected continuation of glacial melting and associated shrinking will sooner or later reach a turning point the glacier supplied surface runoffs and associated water resources will definitely decline by then not only that but the climate changes and climate driving glacial fluctuations are always associated with changes of hydrological chemical and biological properties in water environment such as ph water temperature conductivity and biotic community preston et al 2016 those changes of water environment are crucial to local aquatic ecosystem therefore understanding the hydrological evolution processes and the associated evolutionary mechanisms play important roles in maintaining the aquatic ecosystem health water resource related issues in tctms have a certain degree of research chen et al 2016 deng and chen 2017 shen et al 2013 sorg et al 2012 xu et al 2010 for example tree ring and ice core studies in tctms and the surrounding areas have already produced some quite interesting results chen et al 2013 2015 kreutz and sholkovitz 2000 takeuchi et al 2014 however little is known about how do lakewater properties e g water temperature ph and conductivity respond to climatic changes and the climate driving glacial fluctuations in the climate sensitive alpine area for instance very few high resolution lacustrine records have been retrieved from the alpine lakes in tctms to speculate climatic characters and driving forces lauterbach et al 2014 mathis et al 2014 whereas variations of climate driving water properties were barely mentioned although lacustrine sediments were universally acknowledged to contain unique hydrological information that may not be obtained from tree rings and ice cores in order to deepen our understanding of the water resource and water environment related issues it is necessary to study variations of water environmental parameters and the underlying mechanisms within a longer time window that goes beyond the instrumental period here we conducted a paleolimnological study of lake dalongchi dlc in tctms during the past 520 years involving analysis of diatoms geochemistry and diatom based palaeohydrological reconstructions the goal of this study was to obtain a high resolution palaeohydrological evolution process and to extrapolate the underlying regulation mechanisms during the past hundreds of years such information will provide important insights into alpine hydrological responses to climate changes lending some supports to predicting future changes of water resources and managing water environment in tctms 2 study area lake dalongchi dlc 42 27 n 83 18 e 2400 m a s l a glacial moraine dammed alpine lake

climbing trends during 1958 2013 ce fig 2b c the observed warmest season peak runoff around lake dlc is mainly attributed to the warmest season precipitation and the observed spring mainly april and

extracted from the eastern part of lake dlc at a water depth of 0 5 m using a piston gravity corer in 2013 ce the core was continually sectioned and sampled at 1 cm intervals using a scraper plate the samples were freeze dried first and the laboratory analyses e g grain size and diatom were then performed at xinjiang institute of ecology and geography chinese academy of sciences nine samples were selected for accelerator mass spectrometry ams 14c dating and the dating was carried out at beta analytic inc the samples for grain size analysis were pretreated with 15 ml of 30 h2o2 at 75 c water bath to remove organic matter washed with 10 hcl solution to remove carbonate and then treated with 10 ml of 0 05 m napo3 6 on an ultrasonic vibrator for 10 min to facilitate dispersion grain size

measured by the method of oxidation with potassium chromate total nitrogen tn and c n ratio were determined using a carlo erba 1108 elemental analyzer in samples decalcified with 2 mol l h3po4 lan et al 2018a the carbonate content is determined by measuring the generated co2 volume after treating bulk sediment samples with dilute 1 n hcl and then calculate the carbonate contents based on the quantitative relationship of chemical reaction the samples 0 1 0 2 g each for diatom analysis were prepared according to the standard procedures defined by battarbee et al 2001 specifically a well defined quantity of polymer microsphere divinylbenzene was added to each sample to calculate the diatom concentration and the concentration is expressed as diatom grains per gram dry sediment st jacques et al 2009 species were identified and counted using an olympus bx 43 microscope under an oil immersion objective 10 100 magnification diatom identification was done with references to krammer

depth of 37 5 cm was most likely resulted from carbon reservoir age of lacustrine bulk sediments ultimately a final depth age model was established based on the surficial date five wood plant residual dates and four carbon reservoir effect removed dates and the stratigraphic ages were eventually expressed in the form of common era i e ce fig 3 3 3 statistical analyses pearson correlation coefficients among variables were calculated using spss 22 0 software and constrained incremental sum of squares coniss cluster analysis for diatom was performed using tilia coniss software grimm 1993 diatom based transfer functions from the european diatom database initiative eddi http craticula ncl ac uk eddi jsp were used to infer lakewater ph and conductivity it should particularly be noted that we have validated the applicability of the transfer functions in the eddi to the diatom data obtained from lake dlc our validation showed that the similarities between lake dlc and the eddi training set were 75 in most samples indicating that the eddi transfer functions were applicable to lake dlc for paleoenvironmental interpretation of diatom data we compared several commonly used optional approaches including classic inversed weighted averaging wa and classic inversed locally weighted weighted averaging rantala et al 2015 our comparison showed that waclassic approach produced high jackknifed r2 value r2 jackknife low root mean squared error of prediction rmsep and the lowest maximum bias max bias thus waclassic approach was employed for paleoenvironmental reconstructions in this study in details the performance of diatom inferred ph di ph was r2 jackknife 0 76 rmsep 0 51 max bias 0 14 and the performance of diatom inferred conductivity di cond was r2 jackknife 0 77 rmsep 0 48 max bias 0 51 di ph and di cond were calculated with ernie software 1 0 juggins 2001 4 results 4 1 chronology based on field observations and grain size data e g md the core was lithologically composed of alternations between grayish clayey silt layers and yellowish sandy silt layers fig 3 md slightly varied between 10 and 30 μm indicating a relative weak hydrodynamic condition and a relative stable sedimentary environment five wood plant residual samples and four bulk sediment samples were ams 14c dated table 1 two notes need mentioning before establishing the needed depth age model first the 14c age at the depth of 28 5 cm i e post bomb was rejected and the rejection was based on two older dates at two overlying stratigraphic positions i e 140 30 yr bp at the depth of 13 5 cm and 160 30 yr bp at the depth of 19 5 cm second four bulk sediment based dates from the lower stratigraphic positions are too old in comparison with the corresponding ages that were linearly extrapolated from the surface date and wood plant residue based dates of upper stratigraphic positions implying a remarkable carbon reservoir effect in details a linear regression equation age 5 966 depth 63 r2 0 99 was obtained thus the linearly extrapolated age was 161 yr bp at 37 5 cm the carbon reservoir age i e 1059 yr can be defined as the discrepancy between the bulk sediment based dates 1220 yr bp and the extrapolated dates at the depth of 37 5 cm 161 yr bp in addition the different value between two 14c dates with without carbon reservoir effect at the depth of 37 5 cm i e 1150 yr also proximately supported the aforementioned carbon reservoir age i e 1059 yr table 1 4 2 diatom flora a total of 155 diatom species were identified from the lake dlc core and 28 of them were relatively abundant fig 4 each of the 28 species must have occurred in at least two samples and the relative abundance must be 3 among the 28 diatom species cyclotella ocellata a freshwater species and achnanthes minutissima a fresh brackish species were the absolutely dominant species with their maximum relative abundances exceeding 50 for the purpose of interpreting the diatom spectrum diatoms were classified into three eco groups according to the living forms van dam et al 1994 wilson et al 1994 kashima et al 1997 they were freshwater types including fragilaria amphora cyclotella and navicula cryptocephala fresh brackish types including a minutissima cocconeis placentula var euglypta denticula kuetzingii diatoma moniliforme diploneis oculata gyrosigma acuminatum hantzschia amphioxys navicula menisculus and nitzschia and brackish types including navicula cincta navicula pygmaea navicula veneta nitzschia frustulum and surirella brebissonii based on the results of coniss analysis the diatom spectrum can be categorized into two major assemblage units diatom unit 1 and 2 fig 4 diatom unit 1 was characterized by the appearing of the large number of brackish species e g n cincta n veneta and n frustulum and can be further divided into four sub units diatom sub unit 1 1 43 39 cm 1490 to 1539 ce was singled out by a high abundance of a minutissima a fresh brackish species freshwater species e g fragilaria pinnata amphora inariensis cyclotella comta and cyclotella distinguenda var unipunctata and brackish species e g n cincta n pygmaea n veneta and n frustulum were moderately present diatom sub unit 1 2 39 33 cm 1539 to 1610 ce represented a swift shift from a high abundance of a minutissima a fresh brackish species in sub unit 1 1 to a high abundance of c ocellata a freshwater species that was accompanied by c comta and cyclotella pseudostelligera also freshwater species it was notable that brackish species e g n cincta and n veneta and fresh brackish species e g g acuminatum and h amphioxys were also relatively abundant diatom sub unit 1 3 33 25 cm 1610 to 1702 ce was characterized by the highest abundances of brackish species e g n cincta n veneta n frustulum and s brebissonii the highest abundances of brackish species were accompanied with rather low abundances of two dominant species of the entire core c ocellata a freshwater species and a minutissima a fresh brackish species diatom sub unit 1 4 25 14 cm 1702 to 1835 ce was absolutely dominated by a minutissima a fresh brackish species with its highest abundance of 55 4 some of freshwater species e g fragilaria and n cryptocephala were moderately present and some brackish species e g n cincta n veneta and n frustulum were detectably present diatom unit 2 was typified by an absolute domination of c ocellata a freshwater species and can be further divided into two sub units diatom sub unit 2 1 14 5 cm 1835 to 1944 ce was characterized by the highest abundance of c ocellata a freshwater species one of two core dominating species other freshwater species e g amphora cyclotella and n cryptocephala were also well present it was quite notable that one of two core dominating species a minutissima a fresh brackish species reached its lowest abundance of the entire core accompanied with the lowest abundance of a minutissima diatom assemblages were also presented with merely detectable amounts of other fresh brackish species and nearly complete disappearance of brackish species diatom sub unit 2 2 5 0 cm 1944 to 2013 ce was typified by a considerable increase in the abundance of fresh brackish species e g a minutissima c placentula var euglypta and d oculata at the expense of c ocellata a freshwater species it was also notable that brackish species e g n pygmaea n veneta n frustulum and s brebissonii were moderately present 4 3 ordination of diatom assemblages and the reconstructions a biplot of pca for the main diatom taxa is shown on fig 5 a diatom pca axis 1 dia pca 1 explained 63 of the total variance and diatom pca axis 2 dia pca 2 explained 18 on dia pca 1 high sample score values were associated with cyclotella genus including c ocellata c pseudostelligera c comta and c quadrijuncta on the other hand low sample score values on dia pca 1 were concerned with a minutissima and n cryptocephala fig 5a many kinds of cyclotella genus belong to alkaliphilous species which widely distributed in ph 7 water body smol and stoermer 2010 especially c ocellata a common species in high alkalinity lake anderson et al 2012 whereas a minutissima and n cryptocephala belong to circumneutral species which widely distributed in ph 7 water body van dam et al 1994 thus the dia pca 1 may represent a gradient of ph in lakewater on dia pca 2 high sample scores were associated with freshwater species such as a minutissima and c placentula var euglypta whereas low sample scores were associated with brackish species such as n cincta n veneta n frustulum cumming and smol 1993 gasse 1987 kashima et al 1997 wilson et al 1994 thus the dia pca 2 may refer to a conductivity or salinity gradient the speculations can be demonstrated by the significant correlations between pca axis scores and palaeohydrological reconstructions as well as the proximity between reconstructions of the surface sample and the instrumental data fig 5b c that is dia pca 1 was highly correlated with di ph r 0 96 p 0 01 while dia pca 2 was significantly correlated with di cond r 0 72 p 0 01 di ph was generally low in zone 1 and showed generally high values with a declined trend in zone 2 fig 5b di cond was frequently fluctuated in zone 1 with obviously high values during 1540 to 1700 ce and represented a trough in zone 2 fig 5c 4 4 geochemical analysis results of the geochemical analysis are presented in fig 6 in general particle size related parameters varied much similar or totally inverse the median diameter md in the sediments ranged between 7 1 and 31 9 μm mean 15 9 μm it was nearly parallel with sand content whereas it was opposite with the trends of silt and clay carbonate fluctuated between 9 8 and 27 4 mean 20 0 it was generally low with an average value of 18 8 in zone 1 whereas it increased to a higher level with an average value of 22 6 in zone 2 toc varied between 12 9 and 82 2 mg g mean 38 8 mg g while tn varied between 0 8 and 5 1 mg g mean 2 1 mg g throughout the core toc and tn displayed similar stratigraphic fluctuations showing a generally high level with frequently fluctuations in zone 1 and a generally low level in zone 2 c n ratio varied between 8 8 and 16 9 mean 11 6 being generally higher than 10 throughout the core fig 6 5 discussion 5 1 temperature variations and underlying mechanisms some diatoms were reported to be sensitive to lakewater temperature battarbee et al 2001 bigler et al 2002 rühland et al 2003 smol and stoermer 2010 for example the abundance of small benthic fragilaria species was repeatedly reported to be respondent to the time length of ice cover that in turn modulates by lakewater temperature in alpine area karst riddoch et al 2005 lotter and bigler 2000 smol et al 2005 that is the higher the abundance of the small benthic fragilaria species fragilaria achieved the lower the lakewater temperature was therefore we adopted fragilaria as an indicator of lakewater temperature in dlc sediment core it has been widely accepted that the changes in the total solar irradiance fig 7a steinhilber et al 2012 and also in the atmospheric co2 concentration fig 7b robertson et al 2001 have driven the temperature anomalies of the past millennium in the northern hemisphere nh fig 7c mann et al 2009 the latter half of the past millennium i e the past 500 years was climatologically divided into two major intervals the little ice age lia 1450 to 1850 ce and the current warm period cwp 1850 ce present the nh temperature anomalies of the past 500 years were reasonably responded by two well regarded temperature proxy records retrieved from two sites in the core area of eurasian continent the δ18o of belukha ice core in the altay mountains fig 7 d site 3 in fig 1a and the alkane index i e u 37 k of lake manas in the junggar basin fig 7e site 4 in fig 1a specifically both of the δ18o of ice core and the u 37 k were tested to be acceptable temperature proxies aizen et al 2016 eichler et al 2009 he et al 2013 song et al 2015 toney et al 2010 and both proxy records documented the lia and the cwp our temperature proxy record i e fragilaria of dlc core in tctms fig 7f seems to be the third acceptable temperature proxy record from the core area of eurasian continent stretching from the altay mountains in the north through the junggar basin in the middle to the tianshan mountains in the south again our temperature proxy record i e fragilaria of dlc core seemed to have documented the nh temperature anomalies of the past 500 years that is the temperature was moderate during 1490 to 1590 ce was generally low during 1590 to 1835 ce with the coldest interval spanning from 1680 to 1800 ce and was generally high since 1835 ce it should be important to note that the climbing atmospheric co2 concentration partly accounted for the high level of temperature during cwp 5 2 lakewater ph variations and underlying mechanisms lakewater ph is an important hydrological variable in water body and modulates the composition and structure of biotic community battarbee et al 2001 thus understanding the driving mechanisms of ph variation is vital to aquatic ecology here we adopt pearson correlation analysis among lakewater and sedimentary variables to seek the underlying mechanisms of ph fluctuation table 2 results indicated that di ph was the most significantly negative correlation with tn r 0 54 p 0 01 as well as di ph and toc r 0 52 p 0 01 during geochemical zone 1 tn and toc were generally high corresponding to a relative lower di ph during geochemical zone 2 tn and toc varied at a low level corresponding a higher di ph fig 5 fig 6 these coincidences implied that tn and toc in sediments may be the underlying factors which are likely to affect lakewater ph variations fitting relationship between di ph and tn was further analyzed as well as that between di ph and toc in the dlc sediment core the fitting formulas were di ph 7 39 0 26 ln tn 0 79 r2 0 52 or di ph 8 37 0 30 ln toc 9 63 r2 0 36 fig 8 in general di ph declined with the increase of tn and toc content an increase of nitrogen input represents the loss of watershed acid neutralizing capacity and an increase of toc in sediments means an increase of organic acid input therefore abundant inputs of tn or toc may trigger a significant acidification of lakewater ultimately laudon et al 2000 baron et al 2011 especially in the alpine area e g lake dlc where the ecosystems are much vulnerable to environmental changes grimm et al 2013 large area snowmelt may greatly increase nitrogen and organic acids inputs of watersheds and the inputs may even contribute over 75 of the acidity variation in some cases laudon et al 2000 moreover di ph was coordinated change with carbonate showing a positive correlation r 0 37 p 0 05 based on table 2 it agrees with the basic rule of carbonate deposition that high ph can effectively encourage carbonate precipitation in freshwater the aforementioned relationships will help us to understand the contributions of multiple environmental factors on ph variations within a long time scale facilitating the researches on evolutionary history of paleohydrology to ensure the aquatic ecology safety in the alpine areas 5 3 salinity variations and underlying mechanisms as an alpine lake in the middle northern latitudes di cond of lake dlc a reflection of lakewater salinity or lake level should have responded not only to the changes in climate e g precipitation and temperature but also to the changes in glaciers e g ice melting amount climatologically speaking the atlantic multidecadal oscillations amo was proposed to have strongly affected the westerly downstream areas including the core area of eurasian continent stretching from the altay mountains to the tianshan mountains chen et al 2013 kalra et al 2013 lan et al 2018b lu et al 2006 sun et al 2015 the amo strength was demonstrated to have dictated the warm season precipitation in southern siberia including the altay mountains swp in fig 9 a sun et al 2015 during the past 110 years and also seemingly to have modulated the warm season precipitation at the bayanbulak weather station bwp in fig 9a in tctms during the past 60 years if the instrument record documented tight in phase relationship between the amo strength and the amount of warm season precipitation in the core area of eurasian continent was maintained during the past 500 years the amo strength curve fig 9b can then be used as the regional precipitation proxy curve for tctms where the lake dlc is situated in subsequently the variations in precipitation fig 9b temperature fig 9c fragilaria in lake dlc core and fluctuations of glacier fig 9d were thereby employed to explain the basin moisture variation fig 9e tree ring reconstructed pdsi at site 6 in fig 1a and the di cond variations of lake dlc core fig 9f as shown in fig 9f the di cond exhibited five stages of variations i e stagesⅰ ⅱ iii iv and ⅴ which were approximately correspondent with the aforementioned diatom sub units followings are our explanations of the variations in the lakewater salinity fig 9f with a full consideration of the variations in precipitation temperature and fluctuation of glacier fig 9 b d salinity stageⅰ 1490 to 1540 ce being correspondent with the diatom sub unit 1 1 was characterized by a moderate to low level of the lakewater salinity and occurred under a condition with moderately high precipitation and moderate temperature salinity stage ⅱ 1540 to 1700 ce being correspondent with the diatom sub units 1 2 and 1 3 was manifested by the lowest basin moisture and the highest salinity this situation was most likely resulted from the extremely low precipitation although the temperature was averagely low salinity stage iii 1700 to 1835 ce being correspondent with the diatom sub unit 1 4 was typified by a generally high basin moisture and a stably moderate level of the salinity associating with relatively high precipitation and extremely low temperature it was quite notable that the massively advanced glaciers in the hexilegen pass site 5 in fig 1a and the higher pdsi of hutubi site 6 in fig 1a during this time interval were probably due to high precipitation evaporation ratio under the climatic condition at stage iii chen 1989 li et al 2016 how it was possible to sustain a moderately low lakewater salinity under such climatic condition this may be likely to attribute to hydrologic compensation that is high precipitation should theoretically compensate for the water deficit of lake dlc which inherited from the previous longtime dry period first therefore high precipitation may remarkably promote the basin moisture but it may not significantly change the lake level and the associated lakewater salinity although the rainfall was quite plentiful during this stage salinity stage ⅳ 1835 to 1945 ce being correspondent with the diatom sub unit 2 1 recorded a declined basin moisture but the lowest salinity compared with the variations of climatic condition and basin moisture the stage ⅳ should have a higher level of the salinity under a condition with slightly lowered precipitation proxy values and considerably elevated temperature proxy values in fact the salinity during the stage ⅳ reached the lowest level of the entire core and it was most likely associated more with the fragilaria documented temperature see fig 9c than with the amo index suggested precipitation that is the lowest salinity might have been caused by temperature rising resulted melting of glaciers that advanced massively during the preceding stage i e stage iii thus the diatom flora shifted dramatically at this stage for instance cyclotella genus which favor warmer freshwater environments bloomed smol 2010 whereas n cincta n veneta and n frustulum usually occur in more saline waterbodies nearly disappeared at this stage cumming and smol 1993 gasse 1987 kashima et al 1997 wilson et al 1994 salinity stage ⅴ 1945 to 2013 ce being correspondent with the diatom sub unit 2 2 has a relatively high basin moisture and a low level of the salinity the relatively low level can be attributable to the increase in precipitation and also to increase in glacier melting water under a rising temperature condition during the past 70 years it should be particularly noted that the increases in both precipitation and temperature during the past 70 years was not only reflected in the proxy records see fig 9b c but also was instrumentally recorded at the nearby bayanbulak weather station and many other stations in xinjiang of china chen et al 2016 li et al 2012 xu et al 2010 to sum up the water environment changes involving hydrological chemical and biological properties of lakewater in lake dlc lakewater temperature di ph di cond and diatom assemblages were identified with a remarkable shift at 1835 ce when the temperature began to climb up to a high level in tctms thus 1835 ce is an important time node of water environment changes in tctms climatologically speaking it also roughly corresponded to the boundary timeline between the lia and the cwp it implied that climate warming as an original climatic driving force not only affected water resource variations but also further exerted influences on variations of water properties in tctms this study provides some insights into hydrological variations lakewater temperature di ph di cond and diatom assemblages responding to climate changes in alpine area more details of interactions among multiple factors originating from atmosphere basin and lake should be revealed deepening our understanding on aquatic ecosystem responses under continuing global warming scenarios in the future 6 conclusions based on aforementioned results and discussion following conclusions can be drawn 1 temperature variations have displayed a good consistency in tctms and the adjacent areas in this study fragilaria indicated temperature of lake dlc was moderate from 1490 to 1590 ce relatively low with large amplitude fluctuations from 1590 to 1835 ce with the coldest interval spanning from 1680 to 1800 ce and averagely higher with a general rising trend since 1835 ce the temperature variation in tctms was a reflection of the nh temperature anomaly being primarily driven by the total solar irradiance and the atmospheric co2 concentration 2 di ph was generally low during 1490 to 1835 ce and exhibited a generally high level with a slightly declined trend during 1835 to 2013 ce in general di ph declined with the increasing inputs of tn or toc and increased with carbonate content being significantly correlated with tn toc or carbonate in sediments based on fitting calculations di ph 7 39 0 26 ln tn 0 79 r2 0 52 or di ph 8 37 0 30 ln toc 9 63 r2 0 36 3 the variations of di cond in lake dlc during the past 520 years have been modulated by interplays among three factors the amo driven precipitation temperature dictated evaporation and temperature led glacier melting the lakewater salinity variations were inconsistent with reginal precipitation during 1835 to 1945 ce were likely caused by temperature rising resulted melting of glaciers that advanced massively during the preceding period i e 1700 to 1835 ce 4 the water environment changes lakewater temperature di ph di cond and diatom assemblages of lake dlc were identified with a remarkable shift at 1835 ce when the nh temperature began to climb up to a high level it implied that climate warming not only exerted influences on water resources variations but also further on variations of water properties in tctms acknowledgments this work was supported by
