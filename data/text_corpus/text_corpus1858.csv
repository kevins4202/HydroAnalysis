9290,the occurrence of shallow saline water tables in arid zones provides for groundwater fed natural vegetation and for a substantial amount of irrigated crops water needs this is the case of the hetao plain upper yellow river basin inner mongolia china where one of the major irrigation systems of china and the world is installed as reviewed numerous irrigation and water management studies have been developed in hetao and the upstream irrigated plain of yinchuan ningxia these studies have demonstrated the need for controlling salts through the autumn irrigation and the appropriate irrigation methods and scheduling moreover studies evidenced the need for adopting irrigation schedules that consider groundwater contribution during the crop cycle but most of these studies were empirical resulting difficult to transfer results when models adopted were mechanistic they are difficult to use for irrigation scheduling purposes comparatively with soil water balance swb models thus the current study used two sets of five static water table lysimeters cropped with maize and having water table depths wtd fixed between 0 85 and 2 25 m it was therefore possible to observe the daily capillary rise fluxes from the water table the dynamics of water and salts and to calibrate the swb model simdualkc results show that the average electrical conductivity of the saturated extract of the soil ranged from 3 10 to 4 69 ds m 1 with the higher values observed when wtd was smaller while the electrical conductivity of irrigation water ranged 1 73 1 87 ds m 1 results also show that shallower wtd required less irrigation water but caused higher salinity impacts on crop growth and yields thus the best wtd were around 1 75 2 00 m when basin irrigation was adopted in 2017 and 2018 in these crop seasons the simulated groundwater contribution to actual crop evapotranspiration etc act was up to 37 in the lysimeters having a shallow wtd 1 25 m while in the lysimeters with deeper wtd 2 00 2 25 m it was about 11 of the etc act contrastingly in 2019 when maize was not irrigated the average groundwater contribution represented 73 and 49 of etc act in the lysimeters with shallow and deep wtd respectively results were obtained when a large leaching autumn irrigation 200 mm was performed those experiments showed that solutions for using basin flooding irrigation are ready but still require that irrigation scheduling is adjusted to provide for appropriate use of the saline groundwater contribution which may be performed with the model simdualkc as demonstrated by the high goodness of fit indicators used to evaluate the referred simulations keywords evapotranspiration partitioning crop transpiration soil salinity stress capillary rise water table depth hetao irrigation district data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction agriculture is the largest water user sector worldwide accounting for about 70 of freshwater withdrawals in the world and 90 in the least developed regions wwap 2015 the most significant part is used in irrigation especially in arid and semi arid regions where scarcity prevails population growth associated with the increased demand for other water user sectors further exacerbates the water scarcity issues pereira 2017 as a result the use of poor quality and saline waters for irrigation has become a common practice to address water scarcity namely under drought conditions being even regarded as a vital resource for stable food production minhas and gupta 1992 rhoades et al 1992 hoffman and shalhevet 2007 pereira et al 2009 it is thus critical to improve the understanding of the driving processes influencing the sustainable use of those waters particularly shallow saline groundwater and to implement innovative water management techniques and strategies to mitigate the associated soil salinization risks the hetao plain in inner mongolia with an irrigated area of 570 000 ha and a total of 1 12 mha is one of the three major irrigation districts of china and is the largest irrigated area of the upper yellow river basin irrigation started there about 300 years b c hetao relies heavily on water diverted from the yellow river with annual withdrawals of 4 04 4 74 billion m3 in the 2014 2019 period bwcb 2020 competition among water user sectors imposes a challenging approach in terms of resource scarcity and use of the shallow saline groundwater aiming at the sustainability of agricultural production in addition to hydro geological conditions xu et al 2010 2011 long term excessive water diversion poor irrigation water management and insufficient drainage have contributed to the rise of the saline water table and to widespread salinization of the soil root zone hence subsurface drainage is now under study in the downstream area of hetao dou et al 2021 remote sensing assessments show that most of the area is affected by salinity and most of the non irrigated area is strongly saline wu et al 2008 yu et al 2010 guo et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a competition among water users led to the need for reducing river water withdrawals which resulted in the establishment of water saving measures both relative to crop water use and referring to canal conveyance and distribution pereira et al 2003a xu et al 2010 2011 bai et al 2017 the adoption of canal water saving practices led to a decrease of salinized areas zhao et al 2021 however reducing irrigation water use caused difficulties and environmental problems mainly related with the control of salinity in fact water saving and salinity control may be contradictory while the first requires reducing the applied volumes of water the latter needs adding a leaching fraction finding a balance solution faces an additional difficulty due to the presence of a shallow saline water table which requires finding an appropriate wtd that matches controlling salinity and favoring crop growth and yield hollanders 2005 pereira et al 2007 xu et al 2013 numerous studies by various research teams have been developed in the upper yellow river basin yrb as summarized in table 1 despite papers quoted are very numerous they are only a part of the existing literature which also include those in chinese language and those relative to the large endorreic basins of gansu namely in the wuwei area the studies in the upper yrb were initiated in the area dominated by the huinong canal in ningxia province which findings are included in various literature papers and a book published in both english and chinese versions pereira et al 2003b those studies focused on crop water requirements cwr irrigation scheduling surface irrigation improvements salinity and water table dynamics leaching requirements canal conveyance and distribution management areal impacts of high waters in irrigation and drainage canals as well as socio economic issues a reasonable use of calibrated models was then adopted mainly for maize and wheat further studies were developed years after mainly in the downstream hetao plain table 1 most studies developed swb approaches aimed at describing the interaction of the water table depth wtd with the groundwater contribution gwc to the actual crop evapotranspiration etc act crop yields and water productivity energy balance studies are somewhat rare and summer heat advection is quantified only by wang et al 2020a nevertheless many of these studies did not use models and when used they are mechanistic and focusing processes rarely providing for irrigation scheduling despite the gw is saline many studies did not consider the impacts of salinity or the leaching requirements dealing with shallow wtd requires that irrigation depths and dates are selected to favor the conjunctive use of irrigation and the natural gwc but studies rarely and insufficiently searched for establishing adjusted irrigation schedules in addition while surface irrigation is the common method used by the farmers few studies aimed at its improvement despite model tools were available bai et al 2011 miao et al 2015 2018 dong et al 2018 contrarily most recent studies focused on drip irrigation and do not include assessing investments in equipment nor additional investments required to filter the heavy loaded yellow river water to convert it into a low sediments water which would reduce emitters clogging i e economic studies focusing on drip irrigation are lacking moreover irrigation methods require adjusted irrigation water depth volumes and frequency but related studies are also rare namely referring to perform leaching autumn irrigation when adopting drip irrigation more recently the use of plastic film mulching combined with drip irrigation became commonly used to save water table 1 but results are variable and it is not yet clear how to formulate advice on adjusting the crop coefficients kc or kcb relative to the effects of mulch this insufficient knowledge is due to differences in research methods used in field observations and software approaches applied by the various research teams as well as conceptual differences in used software models as assessed elsewhere pereira et al 2020a for centuries in northern china the essential surface irrigation leaching is practiced in autumn after crops harvesting and before soil water freezes surface basin or border irrigation is used and large water depths are applied 200 mm or more to leach the full root zone traditionally the autumn irrigation is not considered part of the cwr of the spring planted crop and only a few studies account for this water use as in the current study nevertheless the autumn irrigation is fundamental for leaching for improving the structure of the soil root zone due to the multiple occurrences of soil freezing and thawing particularly in silty soils and for constituting a soil water reserve usable after the winter before the first irrigation wang and akae 2004 feng et al 2005 li et al 2012 liu et al 2021 solutions for the practice of autumn irrigation when drip is adopted or for estimating the best application depth as a function of wtd are not yet available irrigation scheduling also needs to be better considered particularly if leaching is to be applied throughout the crop season when the autumn irrigation is limited the success of leaching is also much dependent on drainage which provides for the export of salts so to avoid additional salinity build up from upward fluxes minhas et al 2020 the dynamics of the water table and the resulting gwc and drainage fluxes into and out of the rootzone need to be fully considered when performing the swb pereira et al 2020a however the soil water availability crop roots distribution and growth soil salinity and ion toxicity influence root water uptake crop growth and yield which make wtd related studies rather complex ayars et al 2006 particularly when mathematical models are not used as per table 1 it can be noticed that models are often not used in wtd studies which makes difficult the computation of soil water fluxes particularly capillary rise in addition diverse models are adopted among and internally to the various research groups which differences do not ease the interaction among researchers and the intercomparison of results the upward movement of salts from shallow saline water tables may further promote the salinity build up in the rootzone which requires proper monitoring in such a way that effects on plant health can be noticed before crop development is already affected minhas et al 2020 it is fundamental to precisely quantify the swb thus crop transpiration and soil evaporation fluxes as affected by the gwd and salinity to adequately provide irrigation scheduling information to farmers as well as for delivery scheduling to rationalize canal management gonçalves et al 2007 among methods available to quantify drainage fluxes to precisely quantify the swb crop water use transpiration and soil evaporation both weighing and static water table lysimeters are appropriate allen et al 1991a the former are more often used when a shallow water table is not present as in the previous hetao study liu et al 2022a while the latter supports better the quantification of the terms of the water balance that depend on the wtd kruse et al 1993 ayars et al 2006 particularly when using sets of lysimeters having different wtd which allow to study the impacts and supports selecting the most adequate wtd a summary of the reviewed studies on using static water table lysimeters is presented in table 2 more frequent studies refer to maize but several other field and vegetable crops have been focused on moreover most studies aimed at improved design and use of subirrigation salinity is identified in several cases however not dealt with in most of them when using numerous small lysimeters various salinity levels were studied in association with different wtd these studies provided empirical relations of wtd with capillary rise et and yield in a few cases lysimetric results supported the parameterization of models which are often mechanistic recommendations by allen et al 2011a b are often not fully applied static water table lysimeters can provide accurate measurements of crop groundwater relations but they are expensive and their use is laborious mechanistic soil water flux software models can provide an alternative to direct measurements since they have the potential to precisely estimate capillary rise and deep percolation as such these models have been the preferred tools to evaluate gwc percolation etc and soil salinization risks in hetao table 1 and are the most frequent models used to analyze results of the water table lysimeters table 2 nevertheless water balance models provide a good compromise between simplicity and accuracy and after adequate site specific calibration can be used as reliable methods to estimate gwc percolation etc act as well as impacts of salinity on etc act transpiration yields and water productivity under diverse management conditions allen et al 2011a minhas et al 2020 pereira et al 2020a this is the case of software models isareg and simdualkc referred in tables 1 and 2 because they use parametric functions to compute percolation and capillary rise which were defined after accurate field measurements and data analysis with the mechanistic model wave liu et al 2006 those software models use respectively the fao 56 single and dual crop coefficient kc approaches allen et al 1998 2005 pereira et al 2015a 2020a for estimating evapotranspiration fluxes and the swb terms while the former is simpler and widely used for computing crop water requirements pereira et al 2007 the latter is more precise and provides for partitioning et into crop transpiration tc and soil evaporation es being also able to consider impacts of salinity rosa et al 2012a 2016 swb models further have the advantage of requiring fewer data than the deterministic flux models to characterize the hydraulic properties of the soil profile and to compute the soil water balance therefore simdualkc was previously used to analyze data from weighing lysimeters located in the same area as those of this study liu et al 2022a and to support various field swb studies examples of applications in northern china include miao et al 2016 ran et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 and jia et al 2021 multiple applications of simdualkc are documented relative to various locations worldwide particularly for maize in the north china plain zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 eastern inner mongolia wu et al 2015 southern brazil martins et al 2013 gonzález et al 2015 ávila et al 2017 uruguay giménez et al 2016 and portugal paredes et al 2014 applications with consideration of salinity in addition to the companion paper liu et al 2022a include the use of simdualkc for computing the swb of maize and sorghum irrigated with saline waters rosa et al 2016 which demonstrated the usability of this software when considering impacts of salinity on etc act and tc act the above review of literature relative to the upper yellow river basin shows that interactions among available studies are yet limited either using empirical or modelling interpretations many studies fail to acknowledge the importance of the autumn irrigation as the main pilar of salts leaching and soil quality preservation moreover not considering the amounts of water used in autumn as a large fraction of crop water requirements induces a large sub estimation of their used volumes this is not compatible with the requirements for sustainable uses of soil and water resources for irrigated production in such arid to semi arid regions liu et al 2017 observed that salinity buildup in the upper soil layers of drip irrigated mulched fields is higher than under surface irrigation while beneficiating of autumn leaching impacts of wtd on groundwater contribution and the crop swb are recognized but the transferability of knowledge is yet limited because the use of models is lacking or studies use mechanistic models that make transfer difficult because they are conceptually different moreover the use adaptation development or and comparison of different models follow an increasing tendency of the scientific community to develop new versions of the models or new ones often with no clear gain difficulties aggravate when studies report results from scenario analyses without using adequate field data to properly validate predictions better consideration is required due to the increased expansion of drip irrigation to replace surface irrigation despite the latter is the method used by farmers who have limited capacity to face drip systems investments further approaches to basin and or border irrigation are therefore required considering the review and comments above and that it is essential to improve irrigation management for a better conjunctive use of the shallow saline groundwater and irrigation water for the sustainable use of water and soil in the hetao plain the current study uses static water table lysimeters and the simdualkc software model the specific objectives of the study are i to explore two sets of static lysimeters cropped with maize to measure the impacts of wtd and soil salinity on soil moisture capillary rise percolation the soil water balance and its various terms ii to calibrate and validate the simdualkc software model using those observations to assess the swb and gwc relative to each wtd observed and iii to assess effects of the salinity stress on the swb terms as affected by the wtd and the irrigation options the study innovates relative to previous ones by using a dual kc water balance model instead of a mechanistic model to further assess and develop irrigation management issues calibrating the model using data from observations at various wtd in static water table lysimeters and considering salinity effects on those observation trials under the perspective of improving soil and water resource management in the region innovation further extends to finding the optimum wtd for plant growth in hetao when basin irrigation is adopted which is based on real field data and modeling estimates as compared with the existing literature mostly based on modeling exercises of academic nature the consequent application of the findings of the current study and the assessment of irrigation management alternatives using the simdualkc software model shall be presented in a companion paper 2 material and methods 2 1 study site description this study was carried out at the shuguang experimental station hetao plain inner mongolia china 40 46 n 107 24 e 1039 6 m a s l from 2017 to 2019 where two sets of static water table lysimeters were used this article is a companion paper to that reported by liu et al 2022a relative to a weighing lysimeter study without water table consideration thus because most of the general information is common to both articles it is less developed in the current one the climate is arid continental with the 40 years average annual precipitation of 137 mm mostly occurring in summer the mean annual temperature is 9 1 c the number of frost free days is small from 135 to 150 and the average annual sunshine duration is 3150 h y 1 the weather data were obtained every 30 min then averaged summed for 24 h from a nearby automatic meteorological station placed over a well watered clipped grass data included the maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax tmin ºc average and minimum relative humidity rhmean rhmin the number of sunshine hours nsun h and the wind speed measured at 2 m height u2 m s 1 these daily data were used to compute the grass reference evapotranspiration eto with the fao56 eto equation allen et al 1998 daily precipitation p mm d 1 was also measured a brief characterization of the weather conditions over the three years is given in fig 1 which shows somewhat contrasting rainfall conditions in 2017 and 2018 respectively the years with higher and lower climatic demand adopting the usda soil texture classification usda 1987 the soil in the study area is silty loam the main physical and hydraulic properties are given in table 3 laboratory methods used are described in the companion paper by liu et al 2022a 2 2 lysimeter characteristics and treatments two sets of five static water table lysimeters with 3 3 m 2 0 m and depth of 2 6 m were used they were located inside a maize field 8 6 ha and under an automatic rain shelter their locations distanced not less than 100 m from the field edges to guarantee that the equilibrium boundary layer of air was fully adjusted above lysimeters as recommended by allen et al 1991a b 2011a b and wright 1991 the water table depths wtd m in both sets of lysimeters were 0 85 1 25 1 5 2 0 2 25 m in 2017 and 1 25 1 5 1 75 2 0 2 25 m in 2018 and 2019 thus covering the range of wtd observed in wells monitored by the hetao irrigation district administration bureau throughout the five irrigation subdistricts wulanbuhe jiefangzha yongji yichang and wulate of hetao mariotte bottles were used to supply a stable water flow rate at the lysimeters bottom to maintain the targeted groundwater depth the mariotte bottles were cylindrical with a height of 0 90 m and diameters of 0 20 m for the outer ring and 0 19 m for the inner ring the bottles were placed on adjustable shelves which heights were tuned in each lysimeter for the desired wtd the bottles were further marked with scales which were used to measure every day at 8 00 a m the consumed water the volume difference between two consecutive days corresponded to the portion of groundwater used by the plants the mariotte bottles were then refilled back to the initial mark using ground water pumped from a well located in the experimental field in addition drainage bottles were used to collect and measure the excess applied water relative to the fixed wtd the design of these lysimeters is provided in fig 2 lysimeter walls were metallic wrapped in plastic to reduce their thermal conductance with a total boundary thickness of 5 cm the soil surface inside the lysimeters was at the same level as the surrounding field the gap between the soil surface and lysimeters rims was not more than 5 cm to minimize possible advective effects lysimeters were uniformly packed with the same soil monolith extracted from where they were installed table 3 a 0 25 m thick filter layer with sand and gravel was additionally placed at the bottom of the lysimeters the calibration of the lysimeters followed procedures adapted from those recommended by howell et al 1995 aiming at more precisely controlling the depths of water applied and related impacts so overcoming rainfall influences a rainfall shelter was used to avoid rainfall occurrences a quality assessment and control of the etc act and gwc were conducted along the crop seasons following the recommendations by allen et al 2011b the plants surrounding the lysimeters were monitored to assure that crop et measured in the lysimeter was similar to that of the surrounding area throughout the study years the field wtd surrounding the lysimeters was surveyed using a water level sensor hobo mx2001 04 s onset bourne massachusetts usa maize xi meng 3358 was grown inside and outside lysimeters to ensure a similitude of environmental conditions and the one dimensionality of measurements allen et al 1991a b sowing was performed in april may and harvest was by late september the dates of the crop growth stages were observed locally and are presented in table 4 in 2019 when irrigation was not applied re sowing was required because the emergence and the initial stage were poor thus inducing a large delay in reaching the development stage table 4 comparatively to the period observed in the weighing lysimeters liu et al 2022a sowing was performed hole by hole using a manual hole sowing machine which placed the seeds 0 05 m beneath the soil surface the row spacing was 0 40 m and plants were spaced 0 30 m along the row corresponding to a density of 83 333 plants ha 1 five maize rows were located inside each lysimeter a 0 2 mm thick transparent polyethylene film mulch covered every crop row the total area covered by plastic was 4 95 m2 representing 75 of the lysimeter surface these films were laid on the soil surface before sowing aiming to reduce soil evaporation and increase soil temperature the remaining soil surface was left bare for the application of irrigation water and fertilizers and herbicides which were sprayed on the soil surface to control weeds during the crop seasons as commonly practiced and referred to before an autumn irrigation of 200 mm was applied in all three years table 5 a pre sowing irrigation was also carried out to ensure suitable soil moisture conditions for plant growth the wtd was initially set at the soil surface level and lysimeters were then freely drained until the wtd was set at the targeted depths thus the pre sowing irrigation depths depended upon the wtd selected for each lysimeter table 5 irrigation was performed in 2017 and 2018 following the surface irrigation management practices usually carried out by local farmers thus four irrigation events were practiced table 5 due to the small surface of the lysimeter the irrigation system efficiency was assumed to be 100 irrigation water was pumped from the groundwater conveyed by a pvc pipe and monitored with water meters in 2019 no irrigation was applied but the autumn and the pre sowing irrigations maize water use was sustained only with the soil water stored after that last irrigation and by capillary fluxes from the water table thus varying with wtd fertilization was applied based on soil analysis in 2017 and 2018 fertilization was performed with the same frequencies and amounts as in the surrounding fields as described by liu et al 2022a for the weighing lysimeters in 2019 fertilization was reduced because the crop was highly water stressed in lysimeters having a larger wtd the soil water contents swc were measured every hour with a fdr soil moisture sensor witu agricultural technology shenyang china the fdr sensor is a single pole multi section sensor and each section is composed of a pair of electrodes circular copper rings the maximum length of rod is 2 0 m fdr sensors were placed in all lysimeters at the depths of 0 1 0 2 0 4 m and then at every 0 2 m down to the targeted wtd the frequency of dielectric permittivity of the sensors readings is 100 mhz the probe was inserted into a pvc access tube was installed vertically in the middle of the lysimeter aiming at decreasing the errors in the soil moisture readings the holes were filled in with a soil and water mix which allow decreasing the air gaps between soil and probe access tube the witu fdr sensors have proven to be highly accurate in field conditions and present a negligible influence of temperature on the electrical permittivity zhang et al 2020 however due to the impact of soil salinity on fdr readings e g thompson et al 2007 sevostianova et al 2015 a local calibration of the sensors was performed prior to its use calibration was performed at laboratory following the procedures described by paltineanu and starr 1997 calibration curves were obtained using a soil core that was extracted from the soil where lysimeters were installed for deriving the referred curves the gravimetric method was used as a reference following the procedures proposed by inoue et al 2008 and saito et al 2008 diverse saline solutions were prepared with the addition of sodium chloride nacl 100 salt and diverse rates were used in the soil core to achieve different ece levels of up to 17 7 ds m 1 and diverse volumetric water contents from dry to saturation different calibration curves that convert scaled frequency sf measured into volumetric soil water content were derived for the different ece levels the equation using the pooled values lead to a r2 of 0 78 these results are in the range of those reported by several authors lee and zhang 2007 saito et al 2008 sevostianova et al 2015 matula et al 2016 zemni et al 2019 overall results showed an over estimation of gravimetric swc with a linear increase of swc readings of up to 10 for each 1 ds m 1 increase which is comparable to the results reported by thompson et al 2007 the swc measurement data was assessed in terms of quality swc datasets relative to lysimeters with wtd 1 25 and 1 50 m in 2019 were discarded due to a malfunction of some fdr sensors data of other lysimeters from 13 08 2019 15 09 2019 were also discarded disturbed soil samples 0 1 kg were collected inside lysimeters at the same depths of the swc measurements using a soil auger to determine in the laboratory the electrical conductivity of the 1 5 soil water extract ec1 5 ds m 1 using a dds 11a conductivity meter inesa scientific instrument shanghai china measurements were more frequent in 2017 and 2018 approximately every 10 days than in 2019 which were done only once per month the ec1 5 values were converted into electrical conductivity of the saturation paste extract ece ds m 1 following slavich and petterson 1993 1 ec e f x ec 1 5 2 f 2 46 3

conductivity of the groundwater ecgw was surveyed once a month in each lysimeter by collecting a sample of 300 ml of water in the mariotte bottles ecgw was determined using the referred conductivity

lysimeters every 10 days using a non destructive method to avoid removing plants from the experimental area the length lleaf and width wleaf of all leaves of 9 healthy random plants were measured using a ruler and converted to lai using the relationship proposed by montgomery 1911 3 lai 0 75 i n l w the multiplier may vary with the variety development stage and agronomic practices elings 2000 the maximum root depth was observed at the end of the vegetative stage vt by extracting a soil core with an auger and the root depth was then determined by visual analysis of those soil samples lastly maize yields were obtained by harvesting all plants grown in lysimeters and oven drying them to constant weight water content at about 13 15 2 3 the simdualkc software model 2 3 1 model description the simdualkc is a daily soil water balance model that computes the root zone depletion as follows rosa et al 2012a 4 d r i d r i 1 p ro i i i cr i et c act i dp i where dr is the root zone depletion mm p is the precipitation mm ro is the surface runoff mm i is the net irrigation mm cr is the capillary rise from the water table mm etc act is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm and dp is the deep percolation from the root zone mm all referring to days i or i 1 the model is described in various papers namely by liu et al 2022a as well as by pereira et al 2020a relative to swb models adopting the fao56 method the model adopts the dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 2005 for estimating crop evapotranspiration etc by separately computing its components crop transpiration tc kcb eto and soil evaporation es ke eto the basal crop coefficient kcb integrates the effects of the transpiration characteristics that distinguish a crop from the grass reference crop while the evaporation coefficient ke distinguishes the actual soil cover fraction from the full cover by the grass reference crop under non optimal conditions i e under water and or salinity stresses the potential crop transpiration tc values are reduced using a dimensionless stress coefficient ks resulting in actual crop transpiration t c act k s k cb et o k cb act et o with ks values ranging between 0 1 and 1 0 where the latter refers to non stress conditions under both saline and water stress conditions the model computes ks as allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2007 2020 5 k s taw salt d r taw salt raw salt 1 b k y 100 ec e ec ethreshold where tawsalt and rawsalt are the total and readily available water mm relative to the root zone soil depth zr m under saline conditions dr is the depleted soil

increase in ece above the ece threshold ds m 1 and ky is the yield response factor that describes the relationship between the relative yield decrease and the relative evapotranspiration deficit as defined by stewart et al 1977 and doorenbos and kassam 1979 parameter values are tabulated by minhas et al 2020 the first term on the right side of eq 5 represents the water matric stress when dr i rawsalt and is computed daily through the water balance of the entire root zone the second one is used to correct the former for the effects of salinity osmotic stress i e when ece ece threshold relative to the considered crop the evaporation coefficient ke is computed as allen et al 1998 rosa et al 2012a 6 k e k r k c max k cb act f ew k c max where kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient kc max is the maximum value of kc i e kcb ke following a rain or an irrigation event and few is the fraction of the soil that is both exposed to radiation and wetted by rain or irrigation few depends upon the fraction of ground covered shaded by the crop fc and the fraction of soil wetted by rain or irrigation fw and may be approximated as few min 1 fc fw but preferably should be observed these fractions consist of model inputs alternatively the model accepts lai values as input which are converted into fc using an exponential function of crop height h and lai allen and pereira 2009 pereira et al 2020b kr is computed using the two stage drying cycle approach where the first stage is energy limited and the second is water limited ritchie 1972 2012a when the soil surface is covered by plastic mulch the fc values often increase and therefore the fc values are estimated as f c max f c f r mulch with fr mulch representing the fraction of soil covered by the plastic sheet thus in the simdualkc model the use of mulching leads to a reduction of few which then constrains the kc max by limiting the soil evaporation component for the computation of runoff the model uses the curve number cn method allen et al 2007 in the present study where simdualkc was applied to the lysimeters ro was assumed negligible the capillary rise and deep percolation fluxes are estimated in simdualkc using the parametric equations presented in table 6 which were developed from exploring the wave model applied to field observations of soil water contents and matric potential in a 7 0 m deep experimental facility liu et al 2006 thus the actual cr fluxes mm d 1 are computed daily by considering their dependence on the actual water table depth dw m the actual soil water storage wa mm the potential etc mm d 1 and the maximum capillary rise crmax mm d 1 cr fluxes reduce relative to crmax when wa is high dw increases and or etc act decreases because crmax is a function of lai and dw the lai and dw values observed along the season are input of simdualkc the parameters of the equations in table 6 since they are dependent on the soil s physical and hydraulic characteristics are subjected to the model s calibration process as referred hereafter the dp fluxes mm d 1 are computed using a time decay function relating the soil water storage near saturation with the time after the occurrence of heavy rain or irrigation table 6 the corresponding parameters ad bd are also locally calibrated examples of parameter values for cr and dp according to the soil type are provided by liu et al 2006 these values help selecting the initial default values 2 3 2 model setup the data required to run the simdualkc model for the present study were the following a

seasons an adjustment was performed relative to the ability of the mulch to reduce soil evaporation 2 3 3 model calibration and validation the ability of the simdualkc model to estimate the daily root zone swc values and the daily cr fluxes along the three seasons which are outputs of the model eq 4 was assessed after proper model calibration the assessment focused on the pairwise comparison between fdr sensor observed and model simulated swc and lysimeter observed and model simulated cr fluxes i e statistically comparing observed oi and model predicted values pi the calibration followed an iterative trial and error procedure which consisted of adjusting groups of combined model parameters one at a time within reasonable ranges of values until deviations between oi and pi values were minimized pereira et al 2015b data collected in 2017 in the lysimeter with wtd 2 2 m was used for model calibration because the parameters relative to crop characteristics kcb and p were already calibrated in a previous study liu et al 2022a these values were not changed except the kcb relative to the end season since it depends upon crop management the parameters related to soil evaporation ze rew and tew were also not changed relative to those used by liu et al 2022a calibration focused on estimating the empirical parameters associated with capillary rise a1 a2 a3 a4 b1 b2 b3 b4 and deep percolation ad bd parametric equations the calibration process initiated with the default values of all cr and dp parameters which were based upon the soil characteristics table 3 the first adjustment focused first on the cr parameters a3 a4 b1 b2 b3 b4 followed next by the dp parameters ad and bd the a1 and a2 parameters were adjusted in the continuation because they depend upon wtd and maximum root depth zr max they were calibrated for each water table depth table 6 using the 2017 data sets model calibration was considered terminated when the best fit was achieved and the errors of prediction did not change from one iteration to the next if that goal was not achieved at the end of any modification cycle the calibration process restarted again validation was then performed using the calibrated parameters with the independent data sets obtained in the remaining crop seasons 2018 and 2019 model performance during calibration validation was first assessed through visual analysis of the observed vs predicted values which allowed a fair perception of trends or bias in modelling when they occurred following previous simdualkc model applications pereira et al 2015b liu et al 2022a a set of goodness of fit indicators were used a the regression coefficient b0 of the linear regression between pi and oi forced through the origin b the coefficient of determination r2 of the ordinary least squares regression between pi and oi c the percent bias pbias d the root mean square error rmse mm e the ratio of the rmse to the standard deviation of observed data nrmse mm and f the efficiency of modelling ef non dimensional the equations used to compute those indicators and related targeted values are the same as used in the companion paper liu et al 2022a 3 results field observations most studies performed with static water table lysimeters were not discussed with the support of models but just based upon observations as referred before relative to table 2 exceptions are those by barnard et al 2013 using swamp for maize zhang et al 1999 with waves for alfalfa huo et al 2012 with swap for wheat and karimov et al 2014 with hydrus 1d for cotton thus all mechanistic software models therefore it was considered more adequate to have a section to present and discuss the field observations first despite using the same data to discuss later about the calibration and validation of the simdualkc model 3 1 crop characteristics and yield the root monitoring has shown that zr max was deeper when wtd was also deeper zr max was approximately 0 80 m for wtd of 0 85 m 1 0 m for wtd of 1 25 and 1 50 m 1 20 m for wtd of 1 75 m and 1 40 m for wtd of 2 00 and 2 25 m the observed zr max values were used as input of the simdualkc model the crop height h measurements relative to every lysimeter and the three growing seasons are presented in fig 3 while the measured lai values are shown in fig 4 the highest h 2 53 2 60 m and lai values 4 25 4 64 m2 m 2 were observed at the lysimeters with larger wtd thus coherently with the observed zr max the highest lai values were observed at all crop seasons for wtd 2 0 m contrarily the shallower the wtd was 0 85 m in 2017 and 1 25 m in 2018 and 2019 the smaller h and lai were as explained by minhas et al 2020 the first reaction of plants when exposed to high salinity is to reduce germination but the most conspicuous effect is the growth retardation of crops the detrimental effects include reduced initial water uptake and growth resulting in smaller plants which were here particularly significant at shallower wtd also as early reported by hsiao et al 1976 for the case of salinity plants subjected to mild water stress may exhibit significant reduction on growth while turgor apparently is maintained this conclusive remark of hsiao et al 1976 also explains why maize h and lai were smaller than those observed under low saline conditions in hetao e g miao et al 2016 results indicate that deeper wtd close to 2 0 m provided for better conditions for plant growth in correspondence to a large zr max i e a large root zone volume that favorable crop response was related to the salinity build up in the soil rootzone which increase leads to reducing transpiration rates as early reported by kruse et al 1993 results agree with those reported by many researchers namely for hetao e g mao et al 2017 chang et al 2019 li et al 2019 and with discussions by many researchers e g hsiao et al 1976 rhoades et al 1992 hoffman and shalhevet 2007 and minhas et al 2020 the impacts of salinity and water stress led to relatively low maize yields mainly in 2019 table 8 coherently with the above referred variation of crop growth higher yields were observed for cases of larger wtd of 2 0 and 2 25 m in 2017 and 2018 respectively however without irrigation in 2019 slightly better yields were observed for smaller wtd with the best ones for wtd 1 75 m when capillary fluxes were insufficient to overcome water stress impacts due to lack of irrigation impacts of water stress may then have been greater than salinity effects thus affecting more crop growth and yields observations are coherent with the literature namely that used in table 2 e g benz et al 1985a b kruse et al 1993 and kahlown et al 2005 for maize liu and luo 2011 for wheat karimov et al 2014 for cotton and fidantemiz et al 2019 for soybean nevertheless yield responses vary with the crop soil and water management soil characteristics and climate 3 2 soil water dynamics and capillary rise fluxes the daily values of the soil water content swc measured at the diverse depths in the various lysimeters during the three growing seasons are presented in fig 5 as expected the largest swc fluctuations were observed in the upper soil layers particularly those above 0 40 m where most roots were active the swc peaked immediately after each irrigation water application table 5 to progressively decrease after due to infiltration redistribution and root water uptake in the periods between irrigation events the surface layer down to 0 20 m showed the lowest swc namely due to soil evaporation even though the plastic mulch covered a significant part 75 of the surface area contrarily swc were kept approximately constant in the deeper soil layers due to the upward fluxes from the nearby water table the swc dynamics is commonly found in the literature including when plastic film mulching is used as referred by qi et al 2018 chen et al 2019 and zhang et al 2021b in hetao and elsewhere by han et al 2015 and he et al 2018 by 2019 because maize was not irrigated but just groundwater fed the swc progressively decreased throughout the crop season mainly in the layers above 1 20 m where roots mostly developed like the irrigated cases swc in the bottom soil layers were kept about constant with upward fluxes contributing to that relatively stationary condition during the studied years the groundwater in the field surrounding the lysimeters was surveyed in terms of wtd results have shown that field wtd ranged from 1 35 m to 2 47 m in 2017 from 1 26 m to 3 01 m in 2018 and from 1 39 m to 3 15 m in 2019 these observations justify the wtd fixed for the lysimeters and the abandon of the small wtd of 0 85 m the measured groundwater contribution through cr fluxes relative to all lysimeters is presented in fig 6 for the three experimental seasons results show that for 2017 fig 6a and 2018 fig 6b the cr fluxes mainly occurred when the swc largely decreased after the irrigation events mainly during the mid season when root extraction was larger and the et rate was higher differently during the initial crop growth stage because plant roots were initiating to develop and the atmospheric demand was small the cr fluxes were low mostly below 0 5 mm d 1 thus gw contribution was reduced throughout the 2017 and 2018 seasons the highest cr fluxes were observed in the lysimeter having the shallowest water table while the smallest cr fluxes were for the lysimeter with the largest wtd in 2019 fig 6c because maize was not irrigated but just groundwater fed the cr fluxes consistently increased with time root growth and extraction until water stress was maximal by the end of the mid season when cr started to decrease for the lysimeter with the smallest wtd the groundwater contribution responded quickly to the low swc and the increasing et demand while for other lysimeters that increase in gwc was slower all papers quoted in table 2 show an important response in terms of groundwater contribution kruse et al 1993 reported a decrease in gwc in lysimeters with increased wtd however influenced by salinity which directly affected roots water extraction from the soil among others kahlown et al 2005 liu and luo 2011 karimov et al 2014 and wang et al 2016b reported a decrease in gwc when wtd was deeper like in observations of the current study 3 3 soil irrigation and groundwater salinity the electrical conductivity of the groundwater ecgw in the mariotte bottles and the irrigation water eciw along the three experimental years are shown in table 9 because the source of water for irrigation and the mariotte bottles was the same pumped from a local well the electric conductivity is the same for both in 2017 and 2018 by 2019 because maize was not irrigated there are no eciw values the patterns of the ece in the soil unsaturated zone of all lysimeters along the three growing seasons are shown in fig 7 ece measurements ranged from 2 86 to 4 66 ds m 1 thus always above the maize ece threshold of 1 7 ds m 1 indicating the risk of salinity effects ayers and westcot 1985 allen et al 1998 minhas et al 2020 for all lysimeters the ece fluctuation was related to field irrigation and crop evapotranspiration ece values were always higher in the surface evaporation layer 0 0 10 m and decreasing with depth ece values were also higher at dates immediately before irrigation events then slightly decreasing immediately after due to salts leaching the impact of irrigation on salts leaching was thus clear in all lysimeters for both 2017 and 2018 ece values progressively increased until the next irrigation event due to et rates and the upward movement of salts from the water table back to the rootzone the highest ece values were always measured at the end of the growing season in 2019 since irrigation did not occur ece steadily increased along the season as the lysimeters with the shallower groundwater i e wtd 1 25 m however this leaching was less effective since those lysimeters were those where ece values did show a greater increase throughout the growing season minhas et al 2020 reported that this dynamic because leaching might not be enough efficient in the case of shallow and saline water tables unless drainage is provided to export the salts and to avoid additional root zone salt content from upward fluxes relationships between ece and wtd are well visible higher ece values were observed for the lysimeters having the smaller wtd 1 25 m and the smaller ece was for the case of deeper wtd 2 25 m those relations were affected by the amount of salts transported through cr which were greater when the wtd was shallower and smaller when wtd was greater since the solute transferred from the saline water table was larger the increase of salts transported to the upper soil layers was consequently greater 4 results modeling and discussion 4 1 model calibration validation and performance assessment as previously pointed out the initialization of the simdualkc model was realized using the observed depletion values presented in table 7 the default and calibrated model parameters used in this study relative to every lysimeter are presented in table 10 the calibrated kcb values were retrieved from the previous calibration of the model reported in the companion paper liu et al 2022a they are consistent with the tabulated values for maize given by allen et al 1998 and recently by pereira et al 2021 however with kcb end slightly lower than the one recommended by those authors the calibrated kcb values were also very close to those reported in another study performed in hetao miao et al 2016 the calibrated pini and pmid values agreed with those proposed by allen et al 1998 and pereira et al 2021 however the calibrated pend value 0 80 is much higher than the common values but not far from those reported by miao et al 2016 and rosa et al 2016 this high pend value likely resulted from the need to associate low water availability with salt concentration which tended to be higher by the end of the crop cycle the default values of ece threshold and b proposed for maize by ayers and westcot 1985 hoffman and shalhevet 2007 and minhas et al 2020 were used for computing ks eq 5 as in the companion paper by liu et al 2022a the calibration of the parametric equations relative to the cr fluxes required only small adjustments resulting like those calibrated by liu et al 2006 for silty loam soils however the parameters a1 and a2 relative to the soil water storage equation in the cr parametric approach table 6 changed with wtd table 10 because the depth of the water table largely influences the upward fluxes and simultaneously the transport of salts and the salinity build up in the root zone minhas et al 2020 it is well known that soil salts affect the micro structure of the soil and reduce soil hydraulic conductivity thus restricting upward water fluxes as well as the soil water availability and plants water uptake these conditions impact etc act and tc act consequently also affecting yields thus it is required that parameters a1 and a2 are calibrated for each static wtd important to note that the parametric cr equations used in simdualkc were well proved through the observation of the upward fluxes reported in section 3 1 2 the current experiment assures that the cr parametric approach by liu et al 2006 presented in table 6 is appropriate to use under saline conditions relative to the deep percolation equation also in table 6 effects of wtd were not observed since fluxes occur in saturation conditions with the parameter ad estimated from the characteristics of the soil root zone reservoir and bd adjusted to the slowness of the draining characteristics of the soil liu et al 2006 the goodness of fit indicators resulting from comparing the simulated and the measured swc in every lysimeter during the three growing seasons are presented in table 11 comparisons refer to the use of the calibrated parameters reported in the companion paper liu et al 2022a and to using calibrated parameters specific for each wtd as discussed above the appropriateness of calibrating the most sensitive cr parameters for every wtd is confirmed by the resulting indicators in table 11 when the former calibrated parameters liu et al 2006 relative to variable wtd values were used as default values results show a large inaccuracy low r2 high errors of estimation up to 20 of the mean observed swc and low modeling efficiency with about 50 of the cases with negative ef which indicate that the variance of residuals of the simulations was larger than the variance of observations i e using the mean would be better than using the simulated values differently when the parametric cr equation was calibrated for each wtd both the indicators and the visual observation fig 8 show the good ability of the model for simulating the swc dynamics under the effects of various salinity levels and of upward fluxes relative to the fixed wtd values the calibration indicators in table 11 include the regression coefficients b0 close to 1 ranging 0 97 0 98 showing a slight tendency for the model to under estimate the measured swc data which is confirmed by the low pbias values ranging 2 0 to 2 8 r2 values above 0 75 indicating that the model was able to explain most of the observed variance in the measured dataset thus showing good adequacy of the model for the performed simulation moriasi et al 2007 the small errors of estimate table 11 with the rmse 0 015 m3 m 3 and nrmse 5 indicate that the approach is very good finally the high ef values above 0 57 demonstrate that the variance of residuals was lower or much lower than the variance of measured data the goodness of fit indicators for the validations performed for every wtd confirmed the appropriateness of the calibrated parameters table 11 i e that the swc was adequately simulated there is no tendency for over or under estimation of the observations with b0 ranging 0 97 1 01 and pbias from 0 9 to 2 3 the estimation errors are very low with rmse 0 013 cm3 cm 3 and nrmse 3 8 and high ef 0 71 for wtd 0 85 m the model parameterization was performed using the 2017 data because wtd of 0 85 m was used only in that year these goodness of fit indicators are comparable with other simdualkc applications to irrigated maize rosa et al 2012b martins et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 paredes et al 2014 giménez et al 2016 miao et al 2016 the model was therefore considered appropriate to simulate the swc dynamics with diverse wtd and in presence of salinity 4 2 groundwater contribution the discussed ability of the simdualkc model to simulate the swc is due to the adequate estimation of the cr fluxes therefore the gwc consist of a specific output of the model the daily measured and simulated upward fluxes of all lysimeters are presented in fig 9 relative to the three growing seasons the cr model used in simdualkc rosa et al 2012a b is detailed in table 6 liu et al 2006 its performance was assessed in here in addition to previous performance analyses realized through the calibration and validation of the model rosa et al 2012b wu et al 2015 miao et al 2016 tian et al 2016 liu et al 2022b results in fig 9 show that the cr model can adequately follow the observed upward fluxes along all the surveyed seasons the simulations of the capillary upward fluxes have shown fig 9 under estimation of cr fluxes during the initial crop growth period and a better adherence of simulations to observations after the first irrigation i e from then on the model shows appropriate ability to simulate the cr dynamics however an underestimation tendency was also observed during the mid season in the groundwater fed season of 2019 the respective goodness of fit indicators are presented in table 12 which were obtained through comparing the measured and estimated cr fluxes in each lysimeter when using the calibrated cr parameters table 6 after proper calibration of the cr parameters the simdualkc model showed a good performance in estimating the groundwater contribution to the crops et which led to the good swc results fig 8 and table 11 the goodness of fit indicators show b0 values ranging from 0 94 to 1 06 in the calibration and from 0 88 to 1 11 in the validation indicating that the cr fluxes in some lysimeters were slightly underestimated while in others they were slightly overestimated the pbias values confirmed those results varying from 8 6 5 8 in the validation the r2 values were very high r2 0 84 thus indicating a high explanation of the variance by the model the errors of the estimates were relatively low 0 15 rmse 0 51 mm in the calibration and 0 46 mm in the validation but these rmse may represent up to 50 of the daily average of the observed cr this may be explained by the under estimations during the initial crop stage nonetheless the ef values were always higher than 0 82 thus indicating that the variance of residuals was much smaller than the variance of observations for the smaller wtd 0 85 m results in table 12 show that despite a slight underestimation tendency of the cr fluxes b0 0 94 and pbias 1 3 the model presents an acceptable performance to simulate the cr fluxes with a high ef of 0 87 thus the goodness of fit indicators in table 12 evidence the capability of the simdualkc model to estimate capillary fluxes under saline stress conditions 4 3 potential and actual crop coefficients the fao56 standard kcb segmented curve and the daily variation of the kcb act ke and kc act coefficients are presented in fig 10 for all lysimeters and years of 2017 and 2018 the figure also depicts the observed kc act values derived from the static water table lysimeters irrigation events and water depths applied in both seasons are also included differently fig 11 shows the model simulated crop coefficient curves and the capillary rise fluxes of the non irrigated maize in 2019 when it was only groundwater fed fig 11 also depicts the observed kc act values derived from the water table lysimeters for the wtd 1 75 2 00 and 2 25 m because as stated in section 2 2 the swc data for the wtd 1 25 and 1 50 m had to be discarded and therefore it was not possible to perform the soil water balance within those lysimeters the results presented in fig 10 show that the simdualkc model adequately simulated the patterns of the lysimeter derived kc act values during the initial development and late season stages however during the mid season stage the kc act simulated with simdualkc tend to under estimate the lysimeter derived kc act this is evident particularly during the period 18 31 july 2018 when kc act from lysimeters goes much above 1 20 which may be due to possible advection effects contrastingly during 2019 season fig 11 when maize was ground water dependent thus with high impact of water and salinity stress the kc act during the mid season is adequately simulated by the model thus overall results show a good adequacy of the simdualkc model to predict kc act along the maize seasons when cropped under saline and water stress conditions the standard kcb curves were defined with the values for the initial mid season and end season crop stages obtained through the model calibration which are given in table 10 the kcb act curves also computed with simdualkc departed from the potential kcb curves due to the combined effects of water and salinity stresses reductions due to stresses were less pronounced during the 2017 and 2018 seasons fig 10 because adequate irrigation schedules were applied differently in 2019 fig 11 when the crop only depended on initially stored soil water and on the groundwater contribution the kcb act departed more from the standard kcb and that departure increased progressively as the soil water was consumed and capillary fluxes were insufficient to fulfil the crop water demand crop stress was also larger in lysimeters with shallower water tables where salinity was higher as discussed before fig 7 kc act and kcb act reductions due to salinity stress were constant along the growing season with ece values measured in the root zone presenting a limited range of variation 2 86 4 66 ds m 1 however always above the ece threshold for maize ayers and westcot 1985 minhas et al 2020 the ke values were always higher at the beginning of each crop growing seasons due to availability of water provided by the pre sowing irrigation and large fraction of radiation available at the soil surface since then the fraction of ground covered by the crop was small however due to the effects of plastic mulch the soil surface was only partially exposed to solar radiation nonetheless ke values were kept relatively low ke 0 4 much less than for non mulch conditions when much higher values were observed ke up to 1 2 such as in other applications of simdualkc model for maize zhao et al 2013 paredes et al 2014 miao et al 2016 rosa et al 2016 ke 0 4 are similar to previous applications with organic mulch martins et al 2013 after those ke peaks following each soil wetting their values continuously decreased as the soil surface dried out and with the increasing of canopy cover i e as the availability of water and energy decreased in 2017 and 2018 the ke values rose after each irrigation event due to the increased amount of water available at the surface for evaporation and with the deterioration of the plastic sheets that decreased the mulch effects in 2019 ke values started near 0 4 due to initially high soil water content in the surface layer table 7 and availability of energy at the soil surface then ke decreased to become null a few weeks after since no wettings occurred and the upward fluxes did not attain the soil surface 4 4 maize evapotranspiration partitioning and groundwater contribution the simdualkc results relative to the partition of maize etc act into tc act and es are presented in table 13 in this analysis only the lysimeters with 3 years of data were considered the simulated seasonal etc act ranged from 524 to 571 mm in 2017 and from 593 to 616 mm in 2018 in 2019 when maize was not irrigated but just groundwater fed etc act was smaller 459 494 mm the lowest etc act values were always found in the lysimeters with the shallowest wtd because the salinity was greater there fig 6 as discussed before contrarily the highest etc act values were found in the lysimeters having deeper wtd despite higher cr fluxes were observed in the lysimeters having shallower wtd 1 25 and 1 50 m the upward transport of salts from the saline water table to the rootzone was higher in these lysimeters because upward fluxes were larger the groundwater contribution to et represented 22 39 of the etc act in the lysimeters with shallower wtd table 14 during the growing seasons of 2017 and 2018 but increased to approximately 70 of etc act in 2019 when the crop was just groundwater fed the gwc were lower in the lysimeters having the deepest wtd where the season gwc represented 8 15 of etc act in 2017 and 2018 respectively increasing to 45 52 by 2019 when maize was groundwater fed only table 14 similar behavior was observed relative to the contribution to the tc act during the groundwater fed maize season the soil water storage highly contributed to both etc act and tc act ranging 25 53 the soil evaporation was the main component of etc act during the non growing seasons tables 13 and 14 varying with the precipitation and irrigation wettings as well as with the climatic demand conditions the lower es values during 2017 were also due to the shorter non growing season which spanned from october 2016 to april 2017 differently from the next year when the non growing seasons lasted from september to april from the day after harvest to the day prior to sowing differences on es between the diverse lysimeters resulted from the differences in the pre sowing irrigation depths table 5 during the maize crop season es was less than 26 mm due to ground cover with plastic mulch and lack of precipitation thus the es component was only 3 6 of etc act during the three crop seasons es seasonal values were quite similar among lysimeters because identical irrigation schedules were applied and because wtd does not influence es the results of current study contrast with those of wu et al 2015 who reported es etc act ratios of 17 23 for a groundwater fed maize grown without plastic film in the horqin region northest china zhao et al 2013 reported es etc act ratios of 37 45 for rainwater fed maize grown without stress and no mulch in the north china plain thus the current experiment confirmed the benefits of plastic films as a water saving practice to reduce soil evaporation in dry arid areas such as hetao the potential tc values were 528 577 and 518 mm during the 2017 2018 and 2019 seasons respectively table 13 that variation basically refers to climate factors in all seasons due to the combined effect of salinity and water stress the actual tc values were lower than the potential tc table 14 tc act varied in 2017 2018 and 2019 in the ranges from 415 to 462 mm 460 497 mm and 348 373 mm respectively table 13 this represented a reduction of tc act relative to tc averaging 20 in 2017 and 2018 due to salinity and a small water stress that difference increased to an average of 35 by 2019 because the lack of irrigation led to increased water and salt stress conditions because salts leaching with the irrigation was not possible figs 7 and 11 the etc act and tc act results clearly show that the definition of appropriate irrigation schedules needs to consider the variability of salts concentration and the availability of water as well as the water table depth since all these variables influence both actual etc and transpiration building appropriate schedules requires however the assistance of a water balance software model such as simdualkc that simulates those variables and their interaction 5 conclusions the study was developed in the hetao plain using two sets of five static water table lysimeters which fixed depths ranged from 0 85 to 2 25 m during the 2017 2019 seasons the lysimeters were used to assess the influence of the water table depth on upward flows and related transport of salts into the root zone it was observed that the salinity build up was higher when wtd was smaller which caused the crop to limit etc act the observed results of the lysimeters were used to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model which uses the fao56 dual kc approach for computing and partitioning etc act into tc act and es the model includes a parametric capillary rise approach liu et al 2006 that provides for estimating cr fluxes from the water table since the cr equations are a function of wtd the calibration of the simdualkc model for simulating the soil water dynamics in all lysimeters required a calibration and validation for each wtd while for the other variables parameters that are not dependent on wtd the calibration was performed for all parameters at once because using static water table lysimeters allows to observe cr and gwc for the crop et it resulted possible to calibrate and test the upwards flux model used in simdualkc for every wtd the favorable goodness of fit obtained when assessing both the model to simulate the soil water dynamics for all lysimeters and the cr approach to compute cr and gwc confirmed that both complementary approaches are appropriate to compute the soil water balance and in particular the actual evapotranspiration of a crop in presence of a saline and shallow water table despite the model requires that salinity at various dates are input results show that the modeling approach used is appropriate to describe the joint water and salinity stresses effects on crop et using the stress coefficient ks to adjust the standard kc and kcb to the actual stress conditions such model appropriateness confirms the usability of the ks equation proposed in fao56 it then results in a coherent model estimation of actual transpiration considering the water table depth and the conjunctive use of the groundwater contribution and the irrigation water despite the prevalent saline conditions the use of the model simdualkc produced quite small errors of estimation of the soil water content representing 5 0 of the average swc including the consideration of plastic mulch it was observed that in lysimeters having deep wtd the groundwater contribution was smaller than in lysimeters having shallower wtd furthermore the salinity build up in the rootzone was reduced in the lysimeters with deeper wtd because the larger were the upward fluxes the larger was the transport of salts into the root zone favorable conditions for plant growth thus higher crop height lai and yield were associated with the lowest salinity hence the best cropping conditions refer to wtd of 2 0 m however for conditions of water shortage as for 2019 when irrigation was not applied and the crop was just groundwater fed the best crop growth conditions were found for wtd of 1 75 m shallower water table depths wtd of 0 85 1 50 m always induced a larger accumulation of salts in the root zone due to higher upward water fluxes the groundwater contribution to crop et ranged from 22 to 39 and 8 15 of the etc act observed in the shallower and deeper wtd lysimeters respectively differently when the crop was groundwater fed the gwc was much more important representing respectively 67 73 and 45 52 of etc act these results show the importance of groundwater to agriculture and to the natural groundwater fed vegetation in hetao thus the need for establishing a delicate careful balance between water saving and salinity control in the region which can be performed when using a model such as simdualkc which is a state of the art model for implementation of the fao56 dual kc approach the effects of the autumn irrigation which is applied for centuries in the hetao and the upper yellow river region for leaching salts to minimize and control soil salinization and to soil improvement were observed results from comparing soil salinity at beginning and end of the non growing season show that leaching was effective in reducing ece values during the growing season however for the shallower wtd conditions ece values rapidly increased again during the crop season due to poor drainage conditions results confirm the need for subsurface drainage that already started and which effects need to be assessed jointly while searching improvements in autumn irrigation leaching likely new approaches to the autumn leaching need to be developed aiming at a better combination of irrigation scheduling water table depths and the progressive adoption of drip irrigation however other issues need to be considered for the wide application of drip irrigation namely the higher investment required in equipment and for controlling the effects of the high concentration of sediments in the yellow river water e g to avoid emitters clogging attention must be paid to the autumn irrigation and its leaching and water use effectiveness the transition from surface irrigation to drip requires specific engineering and economic research including relative to leaching and soil protection establishing an appropriate irrigation scheduling to support farmers practices and using a swb software tool as simdualkc requires however the implementation of a survey program to follow up the water table depths and salinity which values shall consist of model inputs throughout the crop season as reviewed in section 1 the research by the academy needs to extend to farming applications i e the research must

9290,the occurrence of shallow saline water tables in arid zones provides for groundwater fed natural vegetation and for a substantial amount of irrigated crops water needs this is the case of the hetao plain upper yellow river basin inner mongolia china where one of the major irrigation systems of china and the world is installed as reviewed numerous irrigation and water management studies have been developed in hetao and the upstream irrigated plain of yinchuan ningxia these studies have demonstrated the need for controlling salts through the autumn irrigation and the appropriate irrigation methods and scheduling moreover studies evidenced the need for adopting irrigation schedules that consider groundwater contribution during the crop cycle but most of these studies were empirical resulting difficult to transfer results when models adopted were mechanistic they are difficult to use for irrigation scheduling purposes comparatively with soil water balance swb models thus the current study used two sets of five static water table lysimeters cropped with maize and having water table depths wtd fixed between 0 85 and 2 25 m it was therefore possible to observe the daily capillary rise fluxes from the water table the dynamics of water and salts and to calibrate the swb model simdualkc results show that the average electrical conductivity of the saturated extract of the soil ranged from 3 10 to 4 69 ds m 1 with the higher values observed when wtd was smaller while the electrical conductivity of irrigation water ranged 1 73 1 87 ds m 1 results also show that shallower wtd required less irrigation water but caused higher salinity impacts on crop growth and yields thus the best wtd were around 1 75 2 00 m when basin irrigation was adopted in 2017 and 2018 in these crop seasons the simulated groundwater contribution to actual crop evapotranspiration etc act was up to 37 in the lysimeters having a shallow wtd 1 25 m while in the lysimeters with deeper wtd 2 00 2 25 m it was about 11 of the etc act contrastingly in 2019 when maize was not irrigated the average groundwater contribution represented 73 and 49 of etc act in the lysimeters with shallow and deep wtd respectively results were obtained when a large leaching autumn irrigation 200 mm was performed those experiments showed that solutions for using basin flooding irrigation are ready but still require that irrigation scheduling is adjusted to provide for appropriate use of the saline groundwater contribution which may be performed with the model simdualkc as demonstrated by the high goodness of fit indicators used to evaluate the referred simulations keywords evapotranspiration partitioning crop transpiration soil salinity stress capillary rise water table depth hetao irrigation district data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction agriculture is the largest water user sector worldwide accounting for about 70 of freshwater withdrawals in the world and 90 in the least developed regions wwap 2015 the most significant part is used in irrigation especially in arid and semi arid regions where scarcity prevails population growth associated with the increased demand for other water user sectors further exacerbates the water scarcity issues pereira 2017 as a result the use of poor quality and saline waters for irrigation has become a common practice to address water scarcity namely under drought conditions being even regarded as a vital resource for stable food production minhas and gupta 1992 rhoades et al 1992 hoffman and shalhevet 2007 pereira et al 2009 it is thus critical to improve the understanding of the driving processes influencing the sustainable use of those waters particularly shallow saline groundwater and to implement innovative water management techniques and strategies to mitigate the associated soil salinization risks the hetao plain in inner mongolia with an irrigated area of 570 000 ha and a total of 1 12 mha is one of the three major irrigation districts of china and is the largest irrigated area of the upper yellow river basin irrigation started there about 300 years b c hetao relies heavily on water diverted from the yellow river with annual withdrawals of 4 04 4 74 billion m3 in the 2014 2019 period bwcb 2020 competition among water user sectors imposes a challenging approach in terms of resource scarcity and use of the shallow saline groundwater aiming at the sustainability of agricultural production in addition to hydro geological conditions xu et al 2010 2011 long term excessive water diversion poor irrigation water management and insufficient drainage have contributed to the rise of the saline water table and to widespread salinization of the soil root zone hence subsurface drainage is now under study in the downstream area of hetao dou et al 2021 remote sensing assessments show that most of the area is affected by salinity and most of the non irrigated area is strongly saline wu et al 2008 yu et al 2010 guo et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a competition among water users led to the need for reducing river water withdrawals which resulted in the establishment of water saving measures both relative to crop water use and referring to canal conveyance and distribution pereira et al 2003a xu et al 2010 2011 bai et al 2017 the adoption of canal water saving practices led to a decrease of salinized areas zhao et al 2021 however reducing irrigation water use caused difficulties and environmental problems mainly related with the control of salinity in fact water saving and salinity control may be contradictory while the first requires reducing the applied volumes of water the latter needs adding a leaching fraction finding a balance solution faces an additional difficulty due to the presence of a shallow saline water table which requires finding an appropriate wtd that matches controlling salinity and favoring crop growth and yield hollanders 2005 pereira et al 2007 xu et al 2013 numerous studies by various research teams have been developed in the upper yellow river basin yrb as summarized in table 1 despite papers quoted are very numerous they are only a part of the existing literature which also include those in chinese language and those relative to the large endorreic basins of gansu namely in the wuwei area the studies in the upper yrb were initiated in the area dominated by the huinong canal in ningxia province which findings are included in various literature papers and a book published in both english and chinese versions pereira et al 2003b those studies focused on crop water requirements cwr irrigation scheduling surface irrigation improvements salinity and water table dynamics leaching requirements canal conveyance and distribution management areal impacts of high waters in irrigation and drainage canals as well as socio economic issues a reasonable use of calibrated models was then adopted mainly for maize and wheat further studies were developed years after mainly in the downstream hetao plain table 1 most studies developed swb approaches aimed at describing the interaction of the water table depth wtd with the groundwater contribution gwc to the actual crop evapotranspiration etc act crop yields and water productivity energy balance studies are somewhat rare and summer heat advection is quantified only by wang et al 2020a nevertheless many of these studies did not use models and when used they are mechanistic and focusing processes rarely providing for irrigation scheduling despite the gw is saline many studies did not consider the impacts of salinity or the leaching requirements dealing with shallow wtd requires that irrigation depths and dates are selected to favor the conjunctive use of irrigation and the natural gwc but studies rarely and insufficiently searched for establishing adjusted irrigation schedules in addition while surface irrigation is the common method used by the farmers few studies aimed at its improvement despite model tools were available bai et al 2011 miao et al 2015 2018 dong et al 2018 contrarily most recent studies focused on drip irrigation and do not include assessing investments in equipment nor additional investments required to filter the heavy loaded yellow river water to convert it into a low sediments water which would reduce emitters clogging i e economic studies focusing on drip irrigation are lacking moreover irrigation methods require adjusted irrigation water depth volumes and frequency but related studies are also rare namely referring to perform leaching autumn irrigation when adopting drip irrigation more recently the use of plastic film mulching combined with drip irrigation became commonly used to save water table 1 but results are variable and it is not yet clear how to formulate advice on adjusting the crop coefficients kc or kcb relative to the effects of mulch this insufficient knowledge is due to differences in research methods used in field observations and software approaches applied by the various research teams as well as conceptual differences in used software models as assessed elsewhere pereira et al 2020a for centuries in northern china the essential surface irrigation leaching is practiced in autumn after crops harvesting and before soil water freezes surface basin or border irrigation is used and large water depths are applied 200 mm or more to leach the full root zone traditionally the autumn irrigation is not considered part of the cwr of the spring planted crop and only a few studies account for this water use as in the current study nevertheless the autumn irrigation is fundamental for leaching for improving the structure of the soil root zone due to the multiple occurrences of soil freezing and thawing particularly in silty soils and for constituting a soil water reserve usable after the winter before the first irrigation wang and akae 2004 feng et al 2005 li et al 2012 liu et al 2021 solutions for the practice of autumn irrigation when drip is adopted or for estimating the best application depth as a function of wtd are not yet available irrigation scheduling also needs to be better considered particularly if leaching is to be applied throughout the crop season when the autumn irrigation is limited the success of leaching is also much dependent on drainage which provides for the export of salts so to avoid additional salinity build up from upward fluxes minhas et al 2020 the dynamics of the water table and the resulting gwc and drainage fluxes into and out of the rootzone need to be fully considered when performing the swb pereira et al 2020a however the soil water availability crop roots distribution and growth soil salinity and ion toxicity influence root water uptake crop growth and yield which make wtd related studies rather complex ayars et al 2006 particularly when mathematical models are not used as per table 1 it can be noticed that models are often not used in wtd studies which makes difficult the computation of soil water fluxes particularly capillary rise in addition diverse models are adopted among and internally to the various research groups which differences do not ease the interaction among researchers and the intercomparison of results the upward movement of salts from shallow saline water tables may further promote the salinity build up in the rootzone which requires proper monitoring in such a way that effects on plant health can be noticed before crop development is already affected minhas et al 2020 it is fundamental to precisely quantify the swb thus crop transpiration and soil evaporation fluxes as affected by the gwd and salinity to adequately provide irrigation scheduling information to farmers as well as for delivery scheduling to rationalize canal management gonçalves et al 2007 among methods available to quantify drainage fluxes to precisely quantify the swb crop water use transpiration and soil evaporation both weighing and static water table lysimeters are appropriate allen et al 1991a the former are more often used when a shallow water table is not present as in the previous hetao study liu et al 2022a while the latter supports better the quantification of the terms of the water balance that depend on the wtd kruse et al 1993 ayars et al 2006 particularly when using sets of lysimeters having different wtd which allow to study the impacts and supports selecting the most adequate wtd a summary of the reviewed studies on using static water table lysimeters is presented in table 2 more frequent studies refer to maize but several other field and vegetable crops have been focused on moreover most studies aimed at improved design and use of subirrigation salinity is identified in several cases however not dealt with in most of them when using numerous small lysimeters various salinity levels were studied in association with different wtd these studies provided empirical relations of wtd with capillary rise et and yield in a few cases lysimetric results supported the parameterization of models which are often mechanistic recommendations by allen et al 2011a b are often not fully applied static water table lysimeters can provide accurate measurements of crop groundwater relations but they are expensive and their use is laborious mechanistic soil water flux software models can provide an alternative to direct measurements since they have the potential to precisely estimate capillary rise and deep percolation as such these models have been the preferred tools to evaluate gwc percolation etc and soil salinization risks in hetao table 1 and are the most frequent models used to analyze results of the water table lysimeters table 2 nevertheless water balance models provide a good compromise between simplicity and accuracy and after adequate site specific calibration can be used as reliable methods to estimate gwc percolation etc act as well as impacts of salinity on etc act transpiration yields and water productivity under diverse management conditions allen et al 2011a minhas et al 2020 pereira et al 2020a this is the case of software models isareg and simdualkc referred in tables 1 and 2 because they use parametric functions to compute percolation and capillary rise which were defined after accurate field measurements and data analysis with the mechanistic model wave liu et al 2006 those software models use respectively the fao 56 single and dual crop coefficient kc approaches allen et al 1998 2005 pereira et al 2015a 2020a for estimating evapotranspiration fluxes and the swb terms while the former is simpler and widely used for computing crop water requirements pereira et al 2007 the latter is more precise and provides for partitioning et into crop transpiration tc and soil evaporation es being also able to consider impacts of salinity rosa et al 2012a 2016 swb models further have the advantage of requiring fewer data than the deterministic flux models to characterize the hydraulic properties of the soil profile and to compute the soil water balance therefore simdualkc was previously used to analyze data from weighing lysimeters located in the same area as those of this study liu et al 2022a and to support various field swb studies examples of applications in northern china include miao et al 2016 ran et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 and jia et al 2021 multiple applications of simdualkc are documented relative to various locations worldwide particularly for maize in the north china plain zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 eastern inner mongolia wu et al 2015 southern brazil martins et al 2013 gonzález et al 2015 ávila et al 2017 uruguay giménez et al 2016 and portugal paredes et al 2014 applications with consideration of salinity in addition to the companion paper liu et al 2022a include the use of simdualkc for computing the swb of maize and sorghum irrigated with saline waters rosa et al 2016 which demonstrated the usability of this software when considering impacts of salinity on etc act and tc act the above review of literature relative to the upper yellow river basin shows that interactions among available studies are yet limited either using empirical or modelling interpretations many studies fail to acknowledge the importance of the autumn irrigation as the main pilar of salts leaching and soil quality preservation moreover not considering the amounts of water used in autumn as a large fraction of crop water requirements induces a large sub estimation of their used volumes this is not compatible with the requirements for sustainable uses of soil and water resources for irrigated production in such arid to semi arid regions liu et al 2017 observed that salinity buildup in the upper soil layers of drip irrigated mulched fields is higher than under surface irrigation while beneficiating of autumn leaching impacts of wtd on groundwater contribution and the crop swb are recognized but the transferability of knowledge is yet limited because the use of models is lacking or studies use mechanistic models that make transfer difficult because they are conceptually different moreover the use adaptation development or and comparison of different models follow an increasing tendency of the scientific community to develop new versions of the models or new ones often with no clear gain difficulties aggravate when studies report results from scenario analyses without using adequate field data to properly validate predictions better consideration is required due to the increased expansion of drip irrigation to replace surface irrigation despite the latter is the method used by farmers who have limited capacity to face drip systems investments further approaches to basin and or border irrigation are therefore required considering the review and comments above and that it is essential to improve irrigation management for a better conjunctive use of the shallow saline groundwater and irrigation water for the sustainable use of water and soil in the hetao plain the current study uses static water table lysimeters and the simdualkc software model the specific objectives of the study are i to explore two sets of static lysimeters cropped with maize to measure the impacts of wtd and soil salinity on soil moisture capillary rise percolation the soil water balance and its various terms ii to calibrate and validate the simdualkc software model using those observations to assess the swb and gwc relative to each wtd observed and iii to assess effects of the salinity stress on the swb terms as affected by the wtd and the irrigation options the study innovates relative to previous ones by using a dual kc water balance model instead of a mechanistic model to further assess and develop irrigation management issues calibrating the model using data from observations at various wtd in static water table lysimeters and considering salinity effects on those observation trials under the perspective of improving soil and water resource management in the region innovation further extends to finding the optimum wtd for plant growth in hetao when basin irrigation is adopted which is based on real field data and modeling estimates as compared with the existing literature mostly based on modeling exercises of academic nature the consequent application of the findings of the current study and the assessment of irrigation management alternatives using the simdualkc software model shall be presented in a companion paper 2 material and methods 2 1 study site description this study was carried out at the shuguang experimental station hetao plain inner mongolia china 40 46 n 107 24 e 1039 6 m a s l from 2017 to 2019 where two sets of static water table lysimeters were used this article is a companion paper to that reported by liu et al 2022a relative to a weighing lysimeter study without water table consideration thus because most of the general information is common to both articles it is less developed in the current one the climate is arid continental with the 40 years average annual precipitation of 137 mm mostly occurring in summer the mean annual temperature is 9 1 c the number of frost free days is small from 135 to 150 and the average annual sunshine duration is 3150 h y 1 the weather data were obtained every 30 min then averaged summed for 24 h from a nearby automatic meteorological station placed over a well watered clipped grass data included the maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax tmin ºc average and minimum relative humidity rhmean rhmin the number of sunshine hours nsun h and the wind speed measured at 2 m height u2 m s 1 these daily data were used to compute the grass reference evapotranspiration eto with the fao56 eto equation allen et al 1998 daily precipitation p mm d 1 was also measured a brief characterization of the weather conditions over the three years is given in fig 1 which shows somewhat contrasting rainfall conditions in 2017 and 2018 respectively the years with higher and lower climatic demand adopting the usda soil texture classification usda 1987 the soil in the study area is silty loam the main physical and hydraulic properties are given in table 3 laboratory methods used are described in the companion paper by liu et al 2022a 2 2 lysimeter characteristics and treatments two sets of five static water table lysimeters with 3 3 m 2 0 m and depth of 2 6 m were used they were located inside a maize field 8 6 ha and under an automatic rain shelter their locations distanced not less than 100 m from the field edges to guarantee that the equilibrium boundary layer of air was fully adjusted above lysimeters as recommended by allen et al 1991a b 2011a b and wright 1991 the water table depths wtd m in both sets of lysimeters were 0 85 1 25 1 5 2 0 2 25 m in 2017 and 1 25 1 5 1 75 2 0 2 25 m in 2018 and 2019 thus covering the range of wtd observed in wells monitored by the hetao irrigation district administration bureau throughout the five irrigation subdistricts wulanbuhe jiefangzha yongji yichang and wulate of hetao mariotte bottles were used to supply a stable water flow rate at the lysimeters bottom to maintain the targeted groundwater depth the mariotte bottles were cylindrical with a height of 0 90 m and diameters of 0 20 m for the outer ring and 0 19 m for the inner ring the bottles were placed on adjustable shelves which heights were tuned in each lysimeter for the desired wtd the bottles were further marked with scales which were used to measure every day at 8 00 a m the consumed water the volume difference between two consecutive days corresponded to the portion of groundwater used by the plants the mariotte bottles were then refilled back to the initial mark using ground water pumped from a well located in the experimental field in addition drainage bottles were used to collect and measure the excess applied water relative to the fixed wtd the design of these lysimeters is provided in fig 2 lysimeter walls were metallic wrapped in plastic to reduce their thermal conductance with a total boundary thickness of 5 cm the soil surface inside the lysimeters was at the same level as the surrounding field the gap between the soil surface and lysimeters rims was not more than 5 cm to minimize possible advective effects lysimeters were uniformly packed with the same soil monolith extracted from where they were installed table 3 a 0 25 m thick filter layer with sand and gravel was additionally placed at the bottom of the lysimeters the calibration of the lysimeters followed procedures adapted from those recommended by howell et al 1995 aiming at more precisely controlling the depths of water applied and related impacts so overcoming rainfall influences a rainfall shelter was used to avoid rainfall occurrences a quality assessment and control of the etc act and gwc were conducted along the crop seasons following the recommendations by allen et al 2011b the plants surrounding the lysimeters were monitored to assure that crop et measured in the lysimeter was similar to that of the surrounding area throughout the study years the field wtd surrounding the lysimeters was surveyed using a water level sensor hobo mx2001 04 s onset bourne massachusetts usa maize xi meng 3358 was grown inside and outside lysimeters to ensure a similitude of environmental conditions and the one dimensionality of measurements allen et al 1991a b sowing was performed in april may and harvest was by late september the dates of the crop growth stages were observed locally and are presented in table 4 in 2019 when irrigation was not applied re sowing was required because the emergence and the initial stage were poor thus inducing a large delay in reaching the development stage table 4 comparatively to the period observed in the weighing lysimeters liu et al 2022a sowing was performed hole by hole using a manual hole sowing machine which placed the seeds 0 05 m beneath the soil surface the row spacing was 0 40 m and plants were spaced 0 30 m along the row corresponding to a density of 83 333 plants ha 1 five maize rows were located inside each lysimeter a 0 2 mm thick transparent polyethylene film mulch covered every crop row the total area covered by plastic was 4 95 m2 representing 75 of the lysimeter surface these films were laid on the soil surface before sowing aiming to reduce soil evaporation and increase soil temperature the remaining soil surface was left bare for the application of irrigation water and fertilizers and herbicides which were sprayed on the soil surface to control weeds during the crop seasons as commonly practiced and referred to before an autumn irrigation of 200 mm was applied in all three years table 5 a pre sowing irrigation was also carried out to ensure suitable soil moisture conditions for plant growth the wtd was initially set at the soil surface level and lysimeters were then freely drained until the wtd was set at the targeted depths thus the pre sowing irrigation depths depended upon the wtd selected for each lysimeter table 5 irrigation was performed in 2017 and 2018 following the surface irrigation management practices usually carried out by local farmers thus four irrigation events were practiced table 5 due to the small surface of the lysimeter the irrigation system efficiency was assumed to be 100 irrigation water was pumped from the groundwater conveyed by a pvc pipe and monitored with water meters in 2019 no irrigation was applied but the autumn and the pre sowing irrigations maize water use was sustained only with the soil water stored after that last irrigation and by capillary fluxes from the water table thus varying with wtd fertilization was applied based on soil analysis in 2017 and 2018 fertilization was performed with the same frequencies and amounts as in the surrounding fields as described by liu et al 2022a for the weighing lysimeters in 2019 fertilization was reduced because the crop was highly water stressed in lysimeters having a larger wtd the soil water contents swc were measured every hour with a fdr soil moisture sensor witu agricultural technology shenyang china the fdr sensor is a single pole multi section sensor and each section is composed of a pair of electrodes circular copper rings the maximum length of rod is 2 0 m fdr sensors were placed in all lysimeters at the depths of 0 1 0 2 0 4 m and then at every 0 2 m down to the targeted wtd the frequency of dielectric permittivity of the sensors readings is 100 mhz the probe was inserted into a pvc access tube was installed vertically in the middle of the lysimeter aiming at decreasing the errors in the soil moisture readings the holes were filled in with a soil and water mix which allow decreasing the air gaps between soil and probe access tube the witu fdr sensors have proven to be highly accurate in field conditions and present a negligible influence of temperature on the electrical permittivity zhang et al 2020 however due to the impact of soil salinity on fdr readings e g thompson et al 2007 sevostianova et al 2015 a local calibration of the sensors was performed prior to its use calibration was performed at laboratory following the procedures described by paltineanu and starr 1997 calibration curves were obtained using a soil core that was extracted from the soil where lysimeters were installed for deriving the referred curves the gravimetric method was used as a reference following the procedures proposed by inoue et al 2008 and saito et al 2008 diverse saline solutions were prepared with the addition of sodium chloride nacl 100 salt and diverse rates were used in the soil core to achieve different ece levels of up to 17 7 ds m 1 and diverse volumetric water contents from dry to saturation different calibration curves that convert scaled frequency sf measured into volumetric soil water content were derived for the different ece levels the equation using the pooled values lead to a r2 of 0 78 these results are in the range of those reported by several authors lee and zhang 2007 saito et al 2008 sevostianova et al 2015 matula et al 2016 zemni et al 2019 overall results showed an over estimation of gravimetric swc with a linear increase of swc readings of up to 10 for each 1 ds m 1 increase which is comparable to the results reported by thompson et al 2007 the swc measurement data was assessed in terms of quality swc datasets relative to lysimeters with wtd 1 25 and 1 50 m in 2019 were discarded due to a malfunction of some fdr sensors data of other lysimeters from 13 08 2019 15 09 2019 were also discarded disturbed soil samples 0 1 kg were collected inside lysimeters at the same depths of the swc measurements using a soil auger to determine in the laboratory the electrical conductivity of the 1 5 soil water extract ec1 5 ds m 1 using a dds 11a conductivity meter inesa scientific instrument shanghai china measurements were more frequent in 2017 and 2018 approximately every 10 days than in 2019 which

the maximum root depth was observed at the end of the vegetative stage vt by extracting a soil core with an auger and the root depth was then determined by visual analysis of those soil samples lastly maize yields were obtained by harvesting all plants grown in lysimeters and oven drying them to constant weight water content at about 13 15 2 3 the simdualkc software model 2 3 1 model description

defined by stewart et al 1977 and doorenbos and kassam 1979 parameter values are tabulated by minhas et al 2020 the first term on the right side of eq 5 represents the water matric stress when dr i rawsalt and is computed daily through the water balance of the entire root zone the second one is used to correct the former for the effects of salinity osmotic stress i e when ece ece threshold relative to the considered crop the evaporation coefficient ke is computed as allen et al 1998 rosa et al 2012a 6 k e k r k c max k cb act f ew k c max where kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient kc max is the maximum value of kc i e kcb ke following a rain or an irrigation event and few is the fraction of the soil that is both exposed to radiation and wetted by rain or irrigation few depends upon the fraction of ground covered shaded by the crop fc and the fraction of soil wetted by rain or irrigation fw and may be approximated as few min 1 fc fw but preferably should be observed these fractions consist of model inputs alternatively the model accepts lai values as input which are converted into fc using an exponential function of crop height h and lai allen and pereira 2009 pereira et al 2020b kr is computed using the two stage drying cycle approach where the first stage is energy limited and the second is water limited ritchie 1972 2012a when the soil surface is covered by plastic mulch the fc values often increase and therefore the fc values are estimated as f c max f c f r mulch with fr mulch representing the fraction of soil covered by the plastic sheet thus in the simdualkc model the use of mulching leads to a reduction of few which then constrains the kc max by limiting the soil evaporation component for the computation of runoff the model uses the curve number cn method allen et al 2007 in the present study where simdualkc was applied to the lysimeters ro was assumed negligible the capillary rise and deep percolation fluxes are estimated in simdualkc using the parametric equations presented in table 6 which were developed from exploring the wave model applied to field observations of soil water contents and matric potential in a 7 0 m deep experimental facility liu et al 2006 thus the actual cr fluxes mm d 1 are computed daily by considering their dependence on the actual water table depth dw m the actual soil water storage wa mm the potential etc mm d 1 and the maximum capillary rise crmax mm d 1 cr fluxes reduce relative to crmax when wa is high dw increases and or etc act decreases because crmax is a function of lai and dw the lai and dw values observed along the season are input of simdualkc the parameters of the equations in table 6 since they are dependent on the soil s physical and hydraulic characteristics are subjected to the model s calibration process as referred hereafter the dp fluxes mm d 1 are computed using a time decay function relating the soil water storage near saturation with the time after the occurrence of heavy rain or irrigation table 6 the corresponding parameters ad bd are also locally calibrated examples of parameter values for cr and dp according to the soil type are provided by liu et al 2006 these values help selecting the initial default values 2 3 2 model setup the data required to run the simdualkc model for the present study were the following a

seasons an adjustment was performed relative to the ability of the mulch to reduce soil evaporation 2 3 3 model calibration and validation the ability of the simdualkc model to estimate the daily root zone swc values and the daily cr fluxes along the three seasons which are outputs of the model eq 4 was assessed after proper model calibration the assessment focused on the pairwise comparison between fdr sensor observed and model simulated swc and lysimeter observed and model simulated cr fluxes i e statistically comparing observed oi and model predicted values pi the calibration followed an iterative trial and error procedure which consisted of adjusting groups of combined model parameters one at a time within reasonable ranges of values until deviations between oi and pi values were minimized pereira et al 2015b data collected in 2017 in the lysimeter with wtd 2 2 m was used for model calibration because the parameters relative to crop characteristics kcb and p were already calibrated in a previous study liu et al 2022a these values were not changed except the kcb relative to the end season since it depends upon crop management the parameters related to soil evaporation ze rew and tew were also not changed relative to those used by liu et al 2022a calibration focused on estimating the empirical parameters associated with capillary rise a1 a2 a3 a4 b1 b2 b3 b4 and deep percolation ad bd parametric equations the calibration process initiated with the default values of all cr and dp parameters which were based upon the soil characteristics table 3 the first adjustment focused first on the cr parameters a3 a4 b1 b2 b3 b4 followed next by the dp parameters ad and bd the a1 and a2 parameters were adjusted in the continuation because they depend upon wtd and maximum root depth zr max they were calibrated for each water table depth table 6 using the 2017 data sets model calibration was considered terminated when the best fit was achieved and the errors of prediction did not change from one iteration to the next if that goal was not achieved at the end of any modification cycle the calibration process restarted again validation was then performed using the calibrated parameters with the independent data sets obtained in the remaining crop seasons 2018 and 2019 model performance during calibration validation was first assessed through visual analysis of the observed vs predicted values which allowed a fair perception of trends or bias in modelling when they occurred following previous simdualkc model applications pereira et al 2015b liu et al 2022a a set of goodness of fit indicators were used a the regression coefficient b0 of the linear regression between pi and oi forced through the origin b the coefficient of determination r2 of the ordinary least squares regression between pi and oi c the percent bias pbias d the root mean square error rmse mm e the ratio of the rmse to the standard deviation of observed data nrmse mm and f the efficiency of modelling ef non dimensional the equations used to compute those indicators and related targeted values are the same as used in the companion paper liu et al 2022a 3 results field observations most studies performed with static water table lysimeters were not discussed with the support of models but just based upon observations as referred before relative to table 2 exceptions are those by barnard et al 2013 using swamp for maize zhang et al 1999 with waves for alfalfa huo et al 2012 with swap for wheat and karimov et al 2014 with hydrus 1d for cotton thus all mechanistic software models therefore it was considered more adequate to have a section to present and discuss the field observations first despite using the same data to discuss later about the calibration and validation of the simdualkc model 3 1 crop characteristics and yield the root monitoring has shown that zr max was deeper when wtd was also deeper zr max was approximately 0 80 m for wtd of 0 85 m 1 0 m for wtd of 1 25 and 1 50 m 1 20 m for wtd of 1 75 m and 1 40 m for wtd of 2 00 and 2 25 m the observed zr max values were used as input of the simdualkc model the crop height h measurements relative to every lysimeter and the three growing seasons are presented in fig 3 while the measured lai values are shown in fig 4 the highest h 2 53 2 60 m and lai values 4 25 4 64 m2 m 2 were observed at the lysimeters with larger wtd thus coherently with the observed zr max the highest lai values were observed at all crop seasons for wtd 2 0 m contrarily the shallower the wtd was 0 85 m in 2017 and 1 25 m in 2018 and 2019 the smaller h and lai were as explained by minhas et al 2020 the first reaction of plants when exposed to high salinity is to reduce germination but the most conspicuous effect is the growth retardation of crops the detrimental effects include reduced initial water uptake and growth resulting in smaller plants which were here particularly significant at shallower wtd also as early reported by hsiao et al 1976 for the case of salinity plants subjected to mild water stress may exhibit significant reduction on growth while turgor apparently is maintained this conclusive remark of hsiao et al 1976 also explains why maize h and lai were smaller than those observed under low saline conditions in hetao e g miao et al 2016 results indicate that deeper wtd close to 2 0 m provided for better conditions for plant growth in correspondence to a large zr max i e a large root zone volume that favorable crop response was related to the salinity build up in the soil rootzone which increase leads to reducing transpiration rates as early reported by kruse et al 1993 results agree with those reported by many researchers namely for hetao e g mao et al 2017 chang et al 2019 li et al 2019 and with discussions by many researchers e g hsiao et al 1976 rhoades et al 1992 hoffman and shalhevet 2007 and minhas et al 2020 the impacts of salinity and water stress led to relatively low maize yields mainly in 2019 table 8 coherently with the above referred variation of crop growth higher yields were observed for cases of larger wtd of 2 0 and 2 25 m in 2017 and 2018 respectively however without irrigation in 2019 slightly better yields were observed for smaller wtd with the best ones for wtd 1 75 m when capillary fluxes were insufficient to overcome water stress impacts due to lack of irrigation impacts of water stress may then have been greater than salinity effects thus affecting more crop growth and yields observations are coherent with the literature namely that used in table 2 e g benz et al 1985a b kruse et al 1993 and kahlown et al 2005 for maize liu and luo 2011 for wheat karimov et al 2014 for cotton and fidantemiz et al 2019 for soybean nevertheless yield responses vary with the crop soil and water management soil characteristics and climate 3 2 soil water dynamics and capillary rise fluxes the daily values of the soil water content swc measured at the diverse depths in the various lysimeters during the three growing seasons are presented in fig 5 as expected the largest swc fluctuations were observed in the upper soil layers particularly those above 0 40 m where most roots were active the swc peaked immediately after each irrigation water application table 5 to progressively decrease after due to infiltration redistribution and root water uptake in the periods between irrigation events the surface layer down to 0 20 m showed the lowest swc namely due to soil evaporation even though the plastic mulch covered a significant part 75 of the surface area contrarily swc were kept approximately constant in the deeper soil layers due to the upward fluxes from the nearby water table the swc dynamics is commonly found in the literature including when plastic film mulching is used as referred by qi et al 2018 chen et al 2019 and zhang et al 2021b in hetao and elsewhere by han et al 2015 and he et al 2018 by 2019 because maize was not irrigated but just groundwater fed the swc progressively decreased throughout the crop season mainly in the layers above 1 20 m where roots mostly developed like the irrigated cases swc in the bottom soil layers were kept about constant with upward fluxes contributing to that relatively stationary condition during the studied years the groundwater in the field surrounding the lysimeters was surveyed in terms of wtd results have shown that field wtd ranged from 1 35 m to 2 47 m in 2017 from 1 26 m to 3 01 m in 2018 and from 1 39 m to 3 15 m in 2019 these observations justify the wtd fixed for the lysimeters and the abandon of the small wtd of 0 85 m the measured groundwater contribution through cr fluxes relative to all lysimeters is presented in fig 6 for the three experimental seasons results show that for 2017 fig 6a and 2018 fig 6b the cr fluxes mainly occurred when the swc largely decreased after the irrigation events mainly during the mid season when root extraction was larger and the et rate was higher differently during the initial crop growth stage because plant roots were initiating to develop and the atmospheric demand was small the cr fluxes were low mostly below 0 5 mm d 1 thus gw contribution was reduced throughout the 2017 and 2018 seasons the highest cr fluxes were observed in the lysimeter having the shallowest water table while the smallest cr fluxes were for the lysimeter with the largest wtd in 2019 fig 6c because maize was not irrigated but just groundwater fed the cr fluxes consistently increased with time root growth and extraction until water stress was maximal by the end of the mid season when cr started to decrease for the lysimeter with the smallest wtd the groundwater contribution responded quickly to the low swc and the increasing et demand while for other lysimeters that increase in gwc was slower all papers quoted in table 2 show an important response in terms of groundwater contribution kruse et al 1993 reported a decrease in gwc in lysimeters with increased wtd however influenced by salinity which directly affected roots water extraction from the soil among others kahlown et al 2005 liu and luo 2011 karimov et al 2014 and wang et al 2016b reported a decrease in gwc when wtd was deeper like in observations of the current study 3 3 soil irrigation and groundwater salinity the electrical conductivity of the groundwater ecgw in the mariotte bottles and the irrigation water eciw along the three experimental years are shown in table 9 because the source of water for irrigation and the mariotte bottles was the same pumped from a local well the electric conductivity is the same for both in 2017 and 2018 by 2019 because maize was not irrigated there are no eciw values the patterns of the ece in the soil unsaturated zone of all lysimeters along the three growing seasons are shown in fig 7 ece measurements ranged from 2 86 to 4 66 ds m 1 thus always above the maize ece threshold of 1 7 ds m 1 indicating the risk of salinity effects ayers and westcot 1985 allen et al 1998 minhas et al 2020 for all lysimeters the ece fluctuation was related to field irrigation and crop evapotranspiration ece values were always higher in the surface evaporation layer 0 0 10 m and decreasing with depth ece values were also higher at dates immediately before irrigation events then slightly decreasing immediately after due to salts leaching the impact of irrigation on salts leaching was thus clear in all lysimeters for both 2017 and 2018 ece values progressively increased until the next irrigation event due to et rates and the upward movement of salts from the water table back to the rootzone the highest ece values were always measured at the end of the growing season in 2019 since irrigation did not occur ece steadily increased along the season as the lysimeters with the shallower groundwater i e wtd 1 25 m however this leaching was less effective since those lysimeters were those where ece values did show a greater increase throughout the growing season minhas et al 2020 reported that this dynamic because leaching might not be enough efficient in the case of shallow and saline water tables unless drainage is provided to export the salts and to avoid additional root zone salt content from upward fluxes relationships between ece and wtd are well visible higher ece values were observed for the lysimeters having the smaller wtd 1 25 m and the smaller ece was for the case of deeper wtd 2 25 m those relations were affected by the amount of salts transported through cr which were greater when the wtd was shallower and smaller when wtd was greater since the solute transferred from the saline water table was larger the increase of salts transported to the upper soil layers was consequently greater 4 results modeling and discussion 4 1 model calibration validation and performance assessment as previously pointed out the initialization of the simdualkc model was realized using the observed depletion values presented in table 7 the default and calibrated model parameters used in this study relative to every lysimeter are presented in table 10 the calibrated kcb values were retrieved from the previous calibration of the model reported in the companion paper liu et al 2022a they are consistent with the tabulated values for maize given by allen et al 1998 and recently by pereira et al 2021 however with kcb end slightly lower than the one recommended by those authors the calibrated kcb values were also very close to those reported in another study performed in hetao miao et al 2016 the calibrated pini and pmid values agreed with those proposed by allen et al 1998 and pereira et al 2021 however the calibrated pend value 0 80 is much higher than the common values but not far from those reported by miao et al 2016 and rosa et al 2016 this high pend value likely resulted from the need to associate low water availability with salt concentration which tended to be higher by the end of the crop cycle the default values of ece threshold and b proposed for maize by ayers and westcot 1985 hoffman and shalhevet 2007 and minhas et al 2020 were used for computing ks eq 5 as in the companion paper by liu et al 2022a the calibration of the parametric equations relative to the cr fluxes required only small adjustments resulting like those calibrated by liu et al 2006 for silty loam soils however the parameters a1 and a2 relative to the soil water storage equation in the cr parametric approach table 6 changed with wtd table 10 because the depth of the water table largely influences the upward fluxes and simultaneously the transport of salts and the salinity build up in the root zone minhas et al 2020 it is well known that soil salts affect the micro structure of the soil and reduce soil hydraulic conductivity thus restricting upward water fluxes as well as the soil water availability and plants water uptake these conditions impact etc act and tc act consequently also affecting yields thus it is required that parameters a1 and a2 are calibrated for each static wtd important to note that the parametric cr equations used in simdualkc were well proved through the observation of the upward fluxes reported in section 3 1 2 the current experiment assures that the cr parametric approach by liu et al 2006 presented in table 6 is appropriate to use under saline conditions relative to the deep percolation equation also in table 6 effects of wtd were not observed since fluxes occur in saturation conditions with the parameter ad estimated from the characteristics of the soil root zone reservoir and bd adjusted to the slowness of the draining characteristics of the soil liu et al 2006 the goodness of fit indicators resulting from comparing the simulated and the measured swc in every lysimeter during the three growing seasons are presented in table 11 comparisons refer to the use of the calibrated parameters reported in the companion paper liu et al 2022a and to using calibrated parameters specific for each wtd as discussed above the appropriateness of calibrating the most sensitive cr parameters for every wtd is confirmed by the resulting indicators in table 11 when the former calibrated parameters liu et al 2006 relative to variable wtd values were used as default values results show a large inaccuracy low r2 high errors of estimation up to 20 of the mean observed swc and low modeling efficiency with about 50 of the cases with negative ef which indicate that the variance of residuals of the simulations was larger than the variance of observations i e using the mean would be better than using the simulated values differently when the parametric cr equation was calibrated for each wtd both the indicators and the visual observation fig 8 show the good ability of the model for simulating the swc dynamics under the effects of various salinity levels and of upward fluxes relative to the fixed wtd values the calibration indicators in table 11 include the regression coefficients b0 close to 1 ranging 0 97 0 98 showing a slight tendency for the model to under estimate the measured swc data which is confirmed by the low pbias values ranging 2 0 to 2 8 r2 values above 0 75 indicating that the model was able to explain most of the observed variance in the measured dataset thus showing good adequacy of the model for the performed simulation moriasi et al 2007 the small errors of estimate table 11 with the rmse 0 015 m3 m 3 and nrmse 5 indicate that the approach is very good finally the high ef values above 0 57 demonstrate that the variance of residuals was lower or much lower than the variance of measured data the goodness of fit indicators for the validations performed for every wtd confirmed the appropriateness of the calibrated parameters table 11 i e that the swc was adequately simulated there is no tendency for over or under estimation of the observations with b0 ranging 0 97 1 01 and pbias from 0 9 to 2 3 the estimation errors are very low with rmse 0 013 cm3 cm 3 and nrmse 3 8 and high ef 0 71 for wtd 0 85 m the model parameterization was performed using the 2017 data because wtd of 0 85 m was used only in that year these goodness of fit indicators are comparable with other simdualkc applications to irrigated maize rosa et al 2012b martins et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 paredes et al 2014 giménez et al 2016 miao et al 2016 the model was therefore considered appropriate to simulate the swc dynamics with diverse wtd and in presence of salinity 4 2 groundwater contribution the discussed ability of the simdualkc model to simulate the swc is due to the adequate estimation of the cr fluxes therefore the gwc consist of a specific output of the model the daily measured and simulated upward fluxes of all lysimeters are presented in fig 9 relative to the three growing seasons the cr model used in simdualkc rosa et al 2012a b is detailed in table 6 liu et al 2006 its performance was assessed in here in addition to previous performance analyses realized through the calibration and validation of the model rosa et al 2012b wu et al 2015 miao et al 2016 tian et al 2016 liu et al 2022b results in fig 9 show that the cr model can adequately follow the observed upward fluxes along all the surveyed seasons the simulations of the capillary upward fluxes have shown fig 9 under estimation of cr fluxes during the initial crop growth period and a better adherence of simulations to observations after the first irrigation i e from then on the model shows appropriate ability to simulate the cr dynamics however an underestimation tendency was also observed during the mid season in the groundwater fed season of 2019 the respective goodness of fit indicators are presented in table 12 which were obtained through comparing the measured and estimated cr fluxes in each lysimeter when using the calibrated cr parameters table 6 after proper calibration of the cr parameters the simdualkc model showed a good performance in estimating the groundwater contribution to the crops et which led to the good swc results fig 8 and table 11 the goodness of fit indicators show b0 values ranging from 0 94 to 1 06 in the calibration and from 0 88 to 1 11 in the validation indicating that the cr fluxes in some lysimeters were slightly underestimated while in others they were slightly overestimated the pbias values confirmed those results varying from 8 6 5 8 in the validation the r2 values were very high r2 0 84 thus indicating a high explanation of the variance by the model the errors of the estimates were relatively low 0 15 rmse 0 51 mm in the calibration and 0 46 mm in the validation but these rmse may represent up to 50 of the daily average of the observed cr this may be explained by the under estimations during the initial crop stage nonetheless the ef values were always higher than 0 82 thus indicating that the variance of residuals was much smaller than the variance of observations for the smaller wtd 0 85 m results in table 12 show that despite a slight underestimation tendency of the cr fluxes b0 0 94 and pbias 1 3 the model presents an acceptable performance to simulate the cr fluxes with a high ef of 0 87 thus the goodness of fit indicators in table 12 evidence the capability of the simdualkc model to estimate capillary fluxes under saline stress conditions 4 3 potential and actual crop coefficients the fao56 standard kcb segmented curve and the daily variation of the kcb act ke and kc act coefficients are presented in fig 10 for all lysimeters and years of 2017 and 2018 the figure also depicts the observed kc act values derived from the static water table lysimeters irrigation events and water depths applied in both seasons are also included differently fig 11 shows the model simulated crop coefficient curves and the capillary rise fluxes of the non irrigated maize in 2019 when it was only groundwater fed fig 11 also depicts the observed kc act values derived from the water table lysimeters for the wtd 1 75 2 00 and 2 25 m because as stated in section 2 2 the swc data for the wtd 1 25 and 1 50 m had to be discarded and therefore it was not possible to perform the soil water balance within those lysimeters the results presented in fig 10 show that the simdualkc model adequately simulated the patterns of the lysimeter derived kc act values during the initial development and late season stages however during the mid season stage the kc act simulated with simdualkc tend to under estimate the lysimeter derived kc act this is evident particularly during the period 18 31 july 2018 when kc act from lysimeters goes much above 1 20 which may be due to possible advection effects contrastingly during 2019 season fig 11 when maize was ground water dependent thus with high impact of water and salinity stress the kc act during the mid season is adequately simulated by the model thus overall results show a good adequacy of the simdualkc model to predict kc act along the maize seasons when cropped under saline and water stress conditions the standard kcb curves were defined with the values for the initial mid season and end season crop stages obtained through the model calibration which are given in table 10 the kcb act curves also computed with simdualkc departed from the potential kcb curves due to the combined effects of water and salinity stresses reductions due to stresses were less pronounced during the 2017 and 2018 seasons fig 10 because adequate irrigation schedules were applied differently in 2019 fig 11 when the crop only depended on initially stored soil water and on the groundwater contribution the kcb act departed more from the standard kcb and that departure increased progressively as the soil water was consumed and capillary fluxes were insufficient to fulfil the crop water demand crop stress was also larger in lysimeters with shallower water tables where salinity was higher as discussed before fig 7 kc act and kcb act reductions due to salinity stress were constant along the growing season with ece values measured in the root zone presenting a limited range of variation 2 86 4 66 ds m 1 however always above the ece threshold for maize ayers and westcot 1985 minhas et al 2020 the ke values were always higher at the beginning of each crop growing seasons due to availability of water provided by the pre sowing irrigation and large fraction of radiation available at the soil surface since then the fraction of ground covered by the crop was small however due to the effects of plastic mulch the soil surface was only partially exposed to solar radiation nonetheless ke values were kept relatively low ke 0 4 much less than for non mulch conditions when much higher values were observed ke up to 1 2 such as in other applications of simdualkc model for maize zhao et al 2013 paredes et al 2014 miao et al 2016 rosa et al 2016 ke 0 4 are similar to previous applications with organic mulch martins et al 2013 after those ke peaks following each soil wetting their values continuously decreased as the soil surface dried out and with the increasing of canopy cover i e as the availability of water and energy decreased in 2017 and 2018 the ke values rose after each irrigation event due to the increased amount of water available at the surface for evaporation and with the deterioration of the plastic sheets that decreased the mulch effects in 2019 ke values started near 0 4 due to initially high soil water content in the surface layer table 7 and availability of energy at the soil surface then ke decreased to become null a few weeks after since no wettings occurred and the upward fluxes did not attain the soil surface 4 4 maize evapotranspiration partitioning and groundwater contribution the simdualkc results relative to the partition of maize etc act into tc act and es are presented in table 13 in this analysis only the lysimeters with 3 years of data were considered the simulated seasonal etc act ranged from 524 to 571 mm in 2017 and from 593 to 616 mm in 2018 in 2019 when maize was not irrigated but just groundwater fed etc act was smaller 459 494 mm the lowest etc act values were always found in the lysimeters with the shallowest wtd because the salinity was greater there fig 6 as discussed before contrarily the highest etc act values were found in the lysimeters having deeper wtd despite higher cr fluxes were observed in the lysimeters having shallower wtd 1 25 and 1 50 m the upward transport of salts from the saline water table to the rootzone was higher in these lysimeters because upward fluxes were larger the groundwater contribution to et represented 22 39 of the etc act in the lysimeters with shallower wtd table 14 during the growing seasons of 2017 and 2018 but increased to approximately 70 of etc act in 2019 when the crop was just groundwater fed the gwc were lower in the lysimeters having the deepest wtd where the season gwc represented 8 15 of etc act in 2017 and 2018 respectively increasing to 45 52 by 2019 when maize was groundwater fed only table 14 similar behavior was observed relative to the contribution to the tc act during the groundwater fed maize season the soil water storage highly contributed to both etc act and tc act ranging 25 53 the soil evaporation was the main component of etc act during the non growing seasons tables 13 and 14 varying with the precipitation and irrigation wettings as well as with the climatic demand conditions the lower es values during 2017 were also due to the shorter non growing season which spanned from october 2016 to april 2017 differently from the next year when the non growing seasons lasted from september to april from the day after harvest to the day prior to sowing differences on es between the diverse lysimeters resulted from the differences in the pre sowing irrigation depths table 5 during the maize crop season es was less than 26 mm due to ground cover with plastic mulch and lack of precipitation thus the es component was only 3 6 of etc act during the three crop seasons es seasonal values were quite similar among lysimeters because identical irrigation schedules were applied and because wtd does not influence es the results of current study contrast with those of wu et al 2015 who reported es etc act ratios of 17 23 for a groundwater fed maize grown without plastic film in the horqin region northest china zhao et al 2013 reported es etc act ratios of 37 45 for rainwater fed maize grown without stress and no mulch in the north china plain thus the current experiment confirmed the benefits of plastic films as a water saving practice to reduce soil evaporation in dry arid areas such as hetao the potential tc values were 528 577 and 518 mm during the 2017 2018 and 2019 seasons respectively table 13 that variation basically refers to climate factors in all seasons due to the combined effect of salinity and water stress the actual tc values were lower than the potential tc table 14 tc act varied in 2017 2018 and 2019 in the ranges from 415 to 462 mm 460 497 mm and 348 373 mm respectively table 13 this represented a reduction of tc act relative to tc averaging 20 in 2017 and 2018 due to salinity and a small water stress that difference increased to an average of 35 by 2019 because the lack of irrigation led to increased water and salt stress conditions because salts leaching with the irrigation was not possible figs 7 and 11 the etc act and tc act results clearly show that the definition of appropriate irrigation schedules needs to consider the variability of salts concentration and the availability of water as well as the water table depth since all these variables influence both actual etc and transpiration building appropriate schedules requires however the assistance of a water balance software model such as simdualkc that simulates those variables and their interaction 5 conclusions the study was developed in the hetao plain using two sets of five static water table lysimeters which fixed depths ranged from 0 85 to 2 25 m during the 2017 2019 seasons the lysimeters were used to assess the influence of the water table depth on upward flows and related transport of salts into the root zone it was observed that the salinity build up was higher when wtd was smaller which caused the crop to limit etc act the observed results of the lysimeters were used to calibrate and validate the simdualkc model which uses the fao56 dual kc approach for computing and partitioning etc act into tc act and es the model includes a parametric capillary rise approach liu et al 2006 that provides for estimating cr fluxes from the water table since the cr equations are a function of wtd the calibration of the simdualkc model for simulating the soil water dynamics in all lysimeters required a calibration and validation for each wtd while for the other variables parameters that are not dependent on wtd the calibration was performed for all parameters at once because using static water table lysimeters allows to observe cr and gwc for the crop et it resulted possible to calibrate and test the upwards flux model used in simdualkc for every wtd the favorable goodness of fit obtained when assessing both the model to simulate the soil water dynamics for all lysimeters and the cr approach to compute cr and gwc confirmed that both complementary approaches are appropriate to compute the soil water balance and in particular the actual evapotranspiration of a crop in presence of a saline and shallow water table despite the model requires that salinity at various dates are input results show that the modeling approach used is appropriate to describe the joint water and salinity stresses effects on crop et using the stress coefficient ks to adjust the standard kc and kcb to the actual stress conditions such model appropriateness confirms the usability of the ks equation proposed in fao56 it then results in a coherent model estimation of actual transpiration considering the water table depth and the conjunctive use of the groundwater contribution and the irrigation water despite the prevalent saline conditions the use of the model simdualkc produced quite small errors of estimation of the soil water content representing 5 0 of the average swc including the consideration of plastic mulch it was observed that in lysimeters having deep wtd the groundwater contribution was smaller than in lysimeters having shallower wtd furthermore the salinity build up in the rootzone was reduced in the lysimeters with deeper wtd because the larger were the upward fluxes the larger was the transport of salts into the root zone favorable conditions for plant growth thus higher crop height lai and yield were associated with the lowest salinity hence the best cropping conditions refer to wtd of 2 0 m however for conditions of water shortage as for 2019 when irrigation was not applied and the crop was just groundwater fed the best crop growth conditions were found for wtd of 1 75 m shallower water table depths wtd of 0 85 1 50 m always induced a larger accumulation of salts in the root zone due to higher upward water fluxes the groundwater contribution to crop et ranged from 22 to 39 and 8 15 of the etc act observed in the shallower and deeper wtd lysimeters respectively differently when the crop was groundwater fed the gwc was much more important representing respectively 67 73 and 45 52 of etc act these results show the importance of groundwater to agriculture and to the natural groundwater fed vegetation in hetao thus the need for establishing a delicate careful balance between water saving and salinity control in the region which can be performed when using a model such as simdualkc which is a state of the art model for implementation of the fao56 dual kc approach the effects of the autumn irrigation which is applied for centuries in the hetao and the upper yellow river region for leaching salts to minimize and control soil salinization and to soil improvement were observed results from comparing soil salinity at beginning and end of the non growing season show that leaching was effective in reducing ece values during the growing season however for the shallower wtd conditions ece values rapidly increased again during the crop season due to poor drainage conditions results confirm the need for subsurface drainage that already started and which effects need to be assessed jointly while searching improvements in autumn irrigation leaching likely new approaches to the autumn leaching need to be developed aiming at a better combination of irrigation scheduling water table depths and the progressive adoption of drip irrigation however other issues need to be considered for the wide application of drip irrigation namely the higher investment required in equipment and for controlling the effects of the high concentration of sediments in the yellow river water e g to avoid emitters clogging attention must be paid to the autumn irrigation and its leaching and water use effectiveness the transition from surface irrigation to drip requires specific engineering and economic research including relative to leaching and soil protection establishing an appropriate irrigation scheduling to support farmers practices and using a swb software tool as simdualkc requires however the implementation of a survey program to follow up the water table depths and salinity which values shall consist of model inputs throughout the crop season as reviewed in section 1 the research by the academy needs to extend to farming applications i e the research must

9291,drought is considered one of the key barriers influencing wheat production and various adaptation schemes are practiced globally to mitigate drought impacts however it is difficult to precisely assess the performances of drought mitigation measures especially when multiple measures are implemented simultaneously here a remote sensing based agricultural drought affected area change index adac was applied to assess the performance of drought mitigation schemes which separates and avoids confusion between performances of drought mitigation and wheat yield improvement the results revealed the historical performance changes and regional differences under drought mitigation measures in 12 major wheat growing regions wgrs of the world the drought mitigation efforts have steadily succeeded with a reduction in the drought affected area of approximately 14 5 in the 1980s and 28 5 in the last decade relatively 55 of drought affected areas are alleviated in the 12 wgrs however there are significant regional differences ranging from 28 to 79 in the 12 wgrs the drought mitigation measures implemented in the wgrs of china and india followed by france and ukraine are more effective than other regions while a few are still declining by further evaluating the effects of short term and long term drought mitigation strategies taken in the wgrs we found that irrigation is the main drought mitigation measure in dryland while measures such as conservation tillage are of great value for yield stability for both dry and wet areas the results of this study improve the understanding of the regional performance of drought mitigation schemes and will help stakeholders to select appropriate measures keywords drought wheat alleviation mitigation remote sensing yield data availability data

2017 globally climate variability accounts for approximately one third of the observed wheat yield changes ray et al 2015 but the degree of yield variance has also changed over time considering that wheat production has increased due to adaptive measures supported by irrigation drought tolerant varieties conservation programs and early warning systems without the application of climate adaptation or drought mitigation measures up to 60 of wheat cultivation will face severe water shortages by the end of the century trnka et al 2019 recent evidence suggests that variations in agricultural prices are linked to the occurrence of large scale droughts schewe et al 2017 drought was one of the key drivers of the 2007 2008 world food price spikes headey 2011 it is important to understand the effects of existing measures in adapting to climate variability particularly extreme weather events such as droughts chen et al 2014 without human intervention natural climate variability controls the amount of water that can be expected at any given location aghakouchak et al 2021 drought is a climatic event that cannot be prevented but interventions can help mitigate the negative impacts of droughts solh and van ginkel 2014 agricultural drought refers to the decline in soil moisture over a period of time which leads to crop failure mishra and singh 2010 however actual agricultural drought is the result of an interplay between a natural event and human interventions agricultural drought impacts are minimized or the actual agricultural drought may not occur if drought mitigation measures are appropriately implemented in time to preserve soil moisture and meet the crop water requirements van loon et al 2016 wu et al 2020 even after meteorological drought occurs from a significant reduction in precipitation hayes et al 2012 pablos et al 2017 the agricultural drought impacts could also be exacerbated by overuse and poor management of scarce water resources aghakouchak et al 2015

2019 planting alternative varieties of drought enduring crops or adopting beneficial field management practices can also help reduce drought induced yield loss by 10 15 li et al 2018 government support that may include releasing early warning information and providing postdisaster technical and financial services has significantly improved farmers ability to combat droughts but such improvements have rarely been quantified chen et al 2014 wang et al 2015 however it is difficult to precisely assess the performance of a drought mitigation measure especially when multiple measures are implemented simultaneously while avoiding mixing the drought mitigation performance with crop production improvements such as water productivity therefore agricultural drought characteristics are used to quantify the performance of drought mitigation measures wu et al 2020 evaluating the performance of drought mitigation measures and their spatial and temporal implications is critical for drought mitigation planning this information can help farmers government agencies and other stakeholders to understand the availability and gaps in drought mitigation measures and can support the development and implementation of better adaptation schemes this in turn will guide field county and national level officials to identify gaps in their drought management strategies thus improving global food security zipper et al 2016 the present study analyzes the historical changes in drought characteristics and the performances of drought mitigation measures practiced in 12 representative wgrs across the globe such an analysis will increase the understanding of the regional performances of drought mitigation measures and will help stakeholders select adaptation measures 2 materials and methods twelve representative wgrs with various climate systems across the world fig 1 and table 1 were selected for this study accounting for 71 of the global wheat growing area 71 of global wheat production and more than 82 of global wheat exports fao 2019 the most intensive wheat cultivation occurs in the temperate latitudes of both hemispheres wheat is most prevalent in northern china the great plains of the united states the canadian prairie provinces the indus and the upper ganges valleys along the kazakhstan and russian border in southern australia throughout europe including turkey

combined with the cropland cover data to generate a more accurate crop distribution data layer the cropland cover data were acquired from the global food security support analysis data gfsad provided by the united states geological survey usgs at a 1 km resolution https lpdaac usgs gov products gfsad1kcmv001 the wheat distribution data from 1995 2000 and 2005 were used for further analysis the crop calendar map used for wheat phenology and the growing period was acquired from the center for sustainability and the global environment university of wisconsin madison https nelson wisc edu sage data and models crop calendar dataset index php sacks et al 2010 the seeding and harvesting dates were extracted from the map and averaged for each wheat growing zone the major growing months for every wheat zone were used for further analysis table 2 the soil water balance is further used for water supply and demand in the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 the pdsi was found to be highly correlated with the soil moisture differences within the uppermost 1 m according to site observations thus site observations are usually adopted to quantify agricultural droughts dai 2011 but can reflect only the changes in soil moisture caused by climate change mu et al 2013 and do not consider the impacts of drought mitigation measures the pdsi dataset used in this study was acquired from the terraclimate http www climatologylab org terraclimate html dataset supported by the university of idaho this dataset is monthly global pdsi data covering the period of 1980 2018 at a 4 km resolution the pdsi is calculated using precipitation and potential evapotranspiration with the penman monteith equation van der schrier et al 2011 wu et al 2021 the pdsi ranges from 10 to 10 representing extremely dry and extremely wet conditions respectively we considered the pdsi drought area percentage higher than 99 as a wall to wall drought and derived its occurrence times accordingly table 1 which means that nearly all pixels within the wgr were lower than the pdsi drought threshold the wgrs in france romania australia and china are prone to wall to wall drought while france and romania may be related to the size of the region the vegetation health index vhi is one of the most commonly used indicators for monitoring the extent of a drought gomes et al 2017 kogan et al 2019 the vhi reflects the actual crop stress considers the local biophysical soil slope and climatic conditions garcía león et al 2019 and is strongly related to crop yield especially in the key stage of crop growth kogan et al 2012 yang et al 2018 the vhi dataset was acquired from the global vegetation health products https www star nesdis noaa gov smcd emb vci vh vh ftp php provided by the center for satellite applications and research national oceanic and atmospheric administration usa noaa star this dataset is a global weekly dataset covering 1982 2018 at a 4 km resolution the vhi can be regarded as an indicator of actual agricultural drought kogan 2002 it ranges from 0 to 100 representing stressed crop conditions to good crop conditions the country level yield fertilizer and cropland irrigation data table 2 were acquired from faostat fao 2019 the fertilizer data include nitrogen n phosphate p2o5 and potash k2o which are converted to wheat fertilizer use based on the nutrient ratio of 200 55 252 for n p2o5 and k2o roy et al 2006 the pdsi describes soil moisture changes that drive climate variability but does not consider the impact of human activities such as irrigation and the planting of drought tolerant varieties therefore the pdsi can reflect agricultural drought only under natural conditions the vhi is a remote sensing data product that monitors crop stress directly which reflects the impact of climate variability and human activities therefore the difference in the drought extent detected by the two indicators can be used to describe the effects of drought mitigation measures in alleviating drought here the proportion is used instead of the actual drought affected area to facilitate comparisons between regions the difference in the proportion of the agricultural drought affected area adac based on the pdsi and the vhi is calculated and averaged over four decades since the 1980s using the following equation 1 adac i pa vhi i β pa pdsi i α where i represents the wheat growing season α is the threshold value for determining a drought condition using the pdsi and β is the threshold value for determining a drought condition using the vhi we set α as 45 and β as 0 5 wu et al 2020 pa is the proportion of cropland area affected by drought derived from either the pdsi for meteorological drought or the vhi for agricultural drought waterlogging and water borne diseases in addition to water stress could also lower the vhi value during the crop growing season thus only when a drought was detected with the pdsi would the vhi be used to detect whether the drought pixel represented an actual drought which could minimize the impact of vhi anomalies caused by factors other than water stress 3 results fig 2 shows the pdsi and the vhi values averaged over the producing area for the four decades for the 12 wgrs as detected by the pdsi the wgrs in australia experienced drought in this century and china and india experienced drought in most years while argentina canada kazakhstan russia ukraine and the usa experienced wet conditions in most years romania and turkey had dry and wet conditions alternatively over years while in france wet or dry conditions could occur in continuity table 3 shows the proportion of the drought affected area detected by the pdsi and vhi as well as their difference adac the yield coefficient of variation and the annual trend slope over the four decades for the 12 major wgrs in the world fig 3 depicts the temporal development of the agricultural drought area proportion as derived from the pdsi and vhi and their relative changes as well as from the decadal averages of the adac there were regional differences in the temporal development patterns of drought among the 12 wgrs with year to year variability on average approximately 51 4 of the wheat growing area suffered from natural agricultural droughts in the 2010s after human intervention this figure decreased to 22 9 with changes of 28 5 in the 2010s increasing from 14 5 in the 1980s however regional differences in the reduction in drought affected areas were significant ranging from 57 to 11 accounting for 28 55 of drought affected areas in the 2010s among the 12 wgrs although different trends of drying and wetting conditions existed over the study areas the adac declined significantly in the current century compared to the first 2 decades 3 1 drought characteristics in 12 wgrs in temperate climates with sufficient precipitation during the wheat growing seasons such as argentina canada kazakhstan russia ukraine and the usa natural droughts derived from the pdsi were moderate with affected areas less than 50 most of the time indicating that severe droughts do not occur frequently in these countries but occasionally such as in 2010 in russia and ukraine loboda et al 2017 as well as in 2018 in the usa and in 2017 in france canada had better agrometeorological conditions in the last decade with only 14 of the area affected by a severe drought russia and ukraine worsened in the last decade with more than 60 of wheat growing cropland suffering from water stress table 3 fig 2 in contrast drier areas in australia france china romania and turkey suffered more severe droughts with more than 50 of the area affected most of the time australia china and france are more vulnerable to natural agricultural drought with maximum affected areas of 68 77 and 72 respectively over the last four decades in the last decade china and france have suffered severe droughts with more than 60 of the wheat growing area affected the australian drought shifted from a moderate to a severe category at the beginning of the 21st century france had the poorest agrometeorological conditions in the last three decades romania suffered a severe drought during the 2000 s table 3 the wgrs in india are located in wet and warm regions wang et al 2021 during the last four decades india has been vulnerable to natural agricultural drought affecting up to 75 of the wheat growing area recently india suffered severe droughts in 2002 2009 and 2012 national rainfed area authority 2013 an actual agricultural drought derived from the vhi is quite different from that derived from the pdsi overall approximately 23 of the wheat growing area was actually affected by drought over the last four decades showing a reduction from 29 in the 1980s to 23 in the 2010s australia was most affected by drought in the 21st century with more than 45 of the wheat area being affected in other regions less than 25 of the wheat area was affected by drought during the last decade this shows that the actual agricultural drought area is less than the natural drought area even without human interventions 3 2 drought mitigation in 12 wgrs the extent of the reduction in the agricultural drought affected area adac varied among the 12 wgrs the adac decreased from 14 6 in the 1980s to 28 5 in the 2010s globally during the last decade the absolute reductions in the adac for china france and ukraine were 50 57 and 49 6 respectively higher than those for other places followed by india 40 5 and russia 36 5 china and france have had greater adac reductions since the 1990s the reduction in adac was low in india russia turkey ukraine and the usa in the last century but has improved recently meaning that the drought resilience capacity has improved in these regions russia and ukraine experienced a 20 decrease in the drought affected area during the last decade compared with the preceding decade for argentina and canada this change was very low over the last four decades only approximately 11 in the last decade indicating weak capacities in adapting to the negative influences of agricultural droughts fig 2 shows the time series of the drought affected area for the 12 major wgrs the drought affected area derived from the pdsi departed gradually from the vhi these departures occurred in china in 1991 india in 2001 romania in 2007 russia in 2005 and ukraine in 2012 and the departures amplified gradually there was no obvious departure in other countries actual agricultural drought conditions in china and india have improved since 1984 and 1987 respectively the pdsi shows that china had the poorest agrometeorological conditions in 2000 and india in 2002 but the vhi detected these conditions or agricultural droughts with significantly different success rates the ndvi has remained stable since the 1980s and fertilizer use and yields have strong increasing trends this leads to the inference that the wheat yield had a significant relationship with the adac since 1980s china and india experienced a sharp increase of fertilizer use and built large areas of irrigation system which helped mitigating the impact of drought turkey had a trend similar to china s and showed a gradual improvement in drought conditions as supported by the ndvi fertilizer use and yield trends 2 13 per year australia s drought resilience has remained largely unchanged since the 1980s with adac ranging between 11 and 22 australia experienced a severe drought with more than 63 of the area being affected by a natural drought and 45 of the area being affected by an actual drought in the beginning of the new century the yield trend agreed with the trend in the drought affected area 0 56 per year rather than with those in the ndvi and fertilizer use france faced the poorest agrometeorological conditions during the last four decades table 1 fig 3 and showed no improvement as determined by the pdsi analysis at the same time the drought affected area as determined by vhi analysis has decreased since the beginning of the 1980s with a maximum adac value of 57 the development of water saving irrigation and rainwater recycling technology has helped reducing the impact area of actual agricultural drought a positive trend for ndvi and a negative trend for fertilizer usage were also observed the increase in wheat yields agreed with the trends in the reductions in drought affected areas in france 2 86 per year russia and ukraine have had similar trends since the 1990s during the last decade the drought affected area as determined by the pdsi analysis was 62 for russia and 73 for ukraine however these percentages changed to 25 and 23 respectively when vhi analysis was used leading to changes of 36 5 and 49 6 respectively data for russia showed that since 2005 there has been a marked increase in the drought affected area as derived from the pdsi analysis which indicates poor agrometeorological conditions in general at the same time the drought affected area as determined by the vhi analysis has decreased since 2010 a positive trend was observed for ndvi since 2004 and for fertilizer usage since 2010 all of these observations agreed well with the increase in wheat yields which suggests that the main factor causing yield changes in russia was the reduction in the drought affected area rather than the poor agrometeorological conditions a significant reduction of 2 80 per year ukraine has had a very significant improvement since the 2000s 2 11 per year kazakhstan and romania similar to russia have had a significant improvement in drought mitigation since the 1990s but the mitigation effect has declined in the last decade as a result of improved agrometeorological conditions wgrs in the united states have been less affected than those in other regions by both natural agricultural drought and actual drought with less than 45 and 28 of the affected areas respectively over the past four decades in the 1980s the proportion of drought area decline was only 6 4 but it was 26 in the 2000s and 17 in the 2010s compared with the other regions the improvement in drought conditions in the united states is relatively low the wheat yield trend agreed more with the reduction in the drought affected area 1 77 per year than with other factors such as ndvi or fertilizer use argentina and canada are the two countries that showed no improvement in drought conditions over the last four decades with adac being less than 16 5 and 26 5 respectively argentina is the only country for which adac has increased since the 1980s meaning that the drought mitigation or adaptation impact has been on a downward trend in fact the crop growing season is not prone to drought which causes a lower vhi value fig 3 the wheat yield variability in kazakhstan is the highest among wgrs with a cv of 20 3 in the 2010s and has remained at a high level since the 1990s followed by the values in romania russia ukraine australia france and argentina with cvs greater than 10 in the 2010s table 3 interannual variability in wheat yields increased with increasing adac although not significantly for the 12 wheat growing zones collectively fig 4 in the 1980s the yield variability did not increase with adac but it increased significantly in the 1990s and the 2000s this increasing trend slowed down in the 2010s when the regions experienced more severe droughts than in the preceding decades table 4 listed the correlation between pdsi vhi and adac derived drought areas pdsi and vhi for each decade is calculated as average the bold numbers represent significant correlation pdsi have a significant positive correlation with vhi and significant negative correlation with adac during most periods while vhi and adac has quite unsignificant correlation which indicates that adac is more influenced by pdsi as meteorological drought is the largest influential factor on adac the nonsignificant correlation between vhi and adac is also an indicator that there exists large divergence between all 12 wgrs which is consistent with previous results 3 3 mitigation of extreme droughts extreme droughts occurred in russia in 2010 the usa in 2018 france in 2012 china in 2009 and india in 2002 table 5 russia experienced its most severe drought during the last half century in 2010 this drought caused russia s wheat yield to be 14 6 lower than the 1992 2018 trend and 17 2 lower than the yield in the previous year fao 2019 wegren 2011 and only 10 5 adac of drought affected areas were alleviated indicating the poor effects of drought mitigation fig 5a drought coverage derived from the pdsi peaked at 63 5 in the usa in february 2018 the actual agricultural drought was severe with a vhi value of 37 2 and approximately 28 4 adac of drought affected areas were mitigated leading to a 3 9 reduction in wheat yield in 2018 compared with that in 2017 http cloud cropwatch com cn fig 5b in the spring of 2012 a severe drought occurred in france france employed adequate drought mitigation measures bringing relief to approximately 94 5 adac of the drought affected area and fao statistics suggested that french wheat yield increased by 7 4 compared with that in 2011 fig 5c indicating that wet conditions instead of drought cause crop stress in the wgr of france ben ari et al 2018 in china the 2009 drought influenced 6 04 million hectares of crops zhang et al 2012 the pdsi drought area was 91 1 for wheat growing cropland and the actual drought area was decreased by 71 9 fig 5d which led to a wheat yield reduction of 0 48 compared to 2008 owing to a 21 5 deficit in seasonal rainfall india experienced a major drought in 2002 bhat 2006 more than 86 of the wheat growing area was influenced but 51 89 was successfully protected from drought fig 5e with a wheat yield 1 99 higher than that in 2001 fig 6 shows the relation of adac and wheat yield changes over 5 extreme drought events china the usa and india had similar wheat yield change percentages under different adac levels based on nonstatistic yield data fig 6b the adac is significantly correlated with yield changes during extreme drought events it is worth noting that in contrast to the decade analysis the adac has a low correlation with the yield cv fig 4 and the adac reflects the drought mitigation effects independent of yield increasing measures the purpose of drought mitigation measures in extreme drought years is to stabilize yield changes from previous normal years the high correlation of adac to yield changes in extreme years meets the expectations of the major purposes of drought mitigation measures 4 discussion agricultural drought is the result of natural water variability climate change human activities and microclimate condition changes due to changes in land and water management aghakouchak et al 2021 therefore there are significant regional differences in drought characteristics and performances of drought mitigation measures traditionally assessment of the performance of drought mitigation measures attempts to describe the effect of a measure in isolation usually observing the changes and results before and after implementation using yield and or water productivity due to the compounding feedback that governs drought state and behavior it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate the effect of a drought mitigation measure and determine which measure plays a leading role but through regional comparison it is possible to understand which region performs better and determine which measures or combinations thereof work using the changes in the proportion of cropland areas affected by drought derived from the pdsi and vhi we analyzed the performances of the drought mitigation measures for 12 major wgrs of the world it was found that the mitigation measures have not fully alleviated the impact of drought in these wgrs the proportion of drought affected area decreased by approximately 28 5 globally accounting for 55 of the drought affected area and drought mitigation efforts have steadily succeeded with the absolute adac increasing from 14 5 to 28 5 over the past four decades the vhi analysis revealed that drought still persists in approximately 22 9 of the wgrs whether an onset of a drought event would cause a disaster for wheat growth depends on both the severity of the event and the vulnerability of the ecosystems experiencing it lesk et al 2016 we have found that there are large regional variabilities in the performance of drought mitigation efforts for all 12 regions studied the adaptation or mitigation schemes were more effective in combating droughts in china india and france argentina and canada apparently did not show improvements table 3 in addition different temporal trends were observed while turkey russia china and india have shown continuous improvement in their drought mitigation performance during the last four decades australia and canada have not exhibited any improvement and argentina s performance has even worsened these regional variations in drought mitigation performance could be a combined result of varying drought mitigation measures and climate conditions prevalent in different regions the relationship between adac and wheat yield variation is positive although not significant in the decade period fig 4 but significant at extreme drought events fig 6 which suggests that the wheat yield and variations are not good indicators to assess the effectiveness of drought mitigation schemes some measures such as irrigation could improve wheat yield hornbeck and keskin 2014 suarez et al 2019 zaveri and lobell 2019 and change drought characteristics since irrigation stabilized the climate extremes and variability which led to yield reductions in rainfed crops but not irrigated crops troy et al 2015 the same benefits apply for mulching and water conservation measures uwizeyimana et al 2018 yan et al 2015 and increases in planting density li et al 2020 solh and van ginkel 2014 some measures such as the development of new varieties of crops qin et al 2015b simtowe et al 2019 and the use of fertilizers pesticides xiao and tao 2014 and small farming practices burrell et al 2017 dobler morales and bocco 2021 could improve yield without directly changing drought characteristics therefore the changes in drought characteristics should be used to assess the performance of drought mitigation schemes wu et al 2020 this approach can avoid confusion between drought mitigation performance and wheat yield improvement 4 1 drought mitigation measures in dryland areas dryland wheat is more vulnerable to drought than irrigated wheat daryanto et al 2016 under drier conditions irrigation is the first choice in combating drought yin et al 2020 zaveri and lobell 2019 as detected by the pdsi wgrs in australia china and india experienced drought in most years which required annual irrigation while those in france romania and turkey required intermittent irrigation since drought alternated over years regions without irrigation suffered more yield losses than regions with irrigation lesk et al 2016 the yield difference between rainfed or dryland and irrigated wheat was 34 9 globally wang et al 2021 water availability for wheat can be further improved by rainfall water harvesting by collecting rain water in on farm reservoirs or catchments for later use by crops biazin et al 2012 china and india have steadily improved their drought mitigation capacity and yield variability since the 1980s the relevant investment and policy interventions have helped expand irrigated areas steadily during the last four decades even under strained water availability zhou et al 2020 china s total irrigated area and the annual irrigation water consumption increased by 10 2 and 29 74 respectively between 1982 and 2015 the irrigated area increased mainly for wheat produced in northern china yin et al 2020 where the irrigation rate was 76 the highest among the 12 wgrs additionally nearly 70 of irrigation was based on groundwater resources wang et al 2019 which led to overexploitation qiu 2010 in addition the chinese government has enhanced its efforts to encourage farmers to adopt water saving technologies which improve irrigation efficiency and management policies all of these measures have increased capabilities to better deal with the increasing water scarcity and support the growth of wheat production in china in india there has been a constant focus on improving drought mitigation measures such as expanding irrigation and rainwater harvesting developing small reservoirs or village ponds and improving soil conservation and waste water recycling for irrigation rao and gopinath 2016 for decades the indian government s policy has been to expand irrigation to cope with drought and thus improve agricultural productivity although the area under wheat cultivation remained stable between 1966 and 2009 the irrigated area increased rapidly zaveri and lobell 2019 with a current irrigation rate of 41 in the wgr although australia suffered severe drought conditions its irrigated area of cropland remains only 8 3 table 2 previous studies have shown that the adoption of new drought resistant wheat varieties and better crop rotation techniques and the application of optimum fertilizer rates caused wheat yields to almost double between 1980 and 2011 burrell et al 2017 in addition changes in farming practices apparently decoupled ndvi trends from rainfall patterns in western australia burrell et al 2017 which was confirmed by the improvement in yield variability however the currently high level of yield variability suggests table 3 that australia needs to implement more measures to combat drought dry and wet conditions alternate over the years in the wgr of romania the high yield variability can be explained by the soil moisture availability from april may and then from november december lecerf et al 2019 the high variability in wheat yield in romania with a cv of 24 89 in the 2000s and 18 72 in the 2010s table 3 ranking second after that in kazakhstan indicates that more drought mitigation measures are needed while irrigation has been used as an effective tool for reducing drought impacts dwindling water resources in some regions elliott et al 2014 cast doubt on the feasibility of irrigation to continue to increase wheat yields on a global scale groundwater abstraction has already exceeded the sustainable yield in many aquifers such as the high plains in the usa scanlon et al 2012 wada et al 2012 2010 north china plain qiu 2010 and india famiglietti 2014 therefore when using irrigation as a short term drought mitigation measure it is necessary to consider the limits of the amount of groundwater available wu et al 2014 and to explore other measures to enhance drought resilience mulching is used as an alternative method to mitigate drought stress mulching which includes covering the soil surface with cover crops crop residues or plastic films prevents water losses from soil reduces soil water evaporation helps preserve root zone moisture during the drought period liakatas et al 1986 and improves crop defenses against annual and seasonal droughts even in relatively humid regions sun et al 2020 china is the largest cropland mulching country lal 2018 the use of plastic film mulching in agriculture has greatly increased from 6 thousand tons in 1982 2 5 million tons in 2018 representing a 400 fold increase changrong et al 2014 the area of cropland covered with mulch increased from 0 12 mha in 1982 4 9 mha in 1991 11 0 mha in 2001 and 17 7 mha in 2018 national bureau of statistics 2018 among the major wheat growing provinces in china hebei henan and shandong the mulch covered cropland area currently exceeds 0 7 mha in 2012 13 of china s cropland was mulched which accounted for nearly 60 of the global mulched area mulching has increased yields by approximately 20 globally qin et al 2015a and by approximately 18 in china tan et al 2019 and has reduced evaporative water loss by approximately 3 on the north china plain yan et al 2015 crop yield increased 77 9 under full mulching and 38 9 under partial mulching irrigation and mulching practices have helped china reduce yield variability conservation agriculture has also been applied to wheat crops under a rice maize wheat rotation on the indo gangetic plains bhan and behera 2014 resulting in india achieving the second lowest yield variability 4 2 drought mitigation measures under wet conditions temperate zones usually experience sufficient precipitation during wheat growing seasons and infrequently suffer water stress therefore irrigation is not considered essential and is not a key factor contributing to obtaining good yields even after mild droughts occur argentina canada kazakhstan russia ukraine and the usa have relatively low percentages less than 17 of irrigated lands table 2 yield anomalies between irrigated wheat and dryland rainfed wheat were not significant in the usa which means that irrigation was not an effective tool to improve wheat s ability to withstand climate risks in the central united states zhang et al 2015 although large scale irrigation development may be unrealistic due to significantly increased fertilizer use since the late 1990s swinnen et al 2017 ukraine and russia had relatively high drought mitigation capacity with absolute adac exceeding 49 6 and 36 5 respectively during the 2010s while regions in the other four countries had lower absolute adac values less than 17 4 for the usa in the 2010s table 3 during dry conditions which sometimes occur wheat yield depends on soil moisture reserves therefore conserving soil moisture is one of the major drought mitigation measures there are a number of methods that can be used to conserve soil moisture bhan and behera 2014 kosmowski 2018 qin et al 2015a zipper et al 2015 such as mulching which relies on providing some kind of cover for the soil to reduce evaporation and prevent soil exposure to direct sunlight yan et al 2015 in addition the methods used for improving soil quality and conservation will help conserve soil moisture and thereby mitigate droughts the conservation tillage practice where the crop residue is left on the soil to reduce evaporation and protect the soil surface from wind erosion direct sunlight and heavy rain impacts increases the soil s capacity to absorb and retain water water conservation is also possible by minimizing soil disturbance and reducing nonbeneficial evaporative water loss from the soil surface stagnari et al 2014 canadian and us farmers have improved their drought resilience or mitigation measures over time these measures include developing and adopting drought tolerant crop varieties implementing no till sowing and fallowing and leaving crop residues after the harvest wallander et al 2013 drought mitigation measures used in the united states include developing an early warning system for drought developing drought resistant varieties improving irrigation efficiency enhancing drought resilience and improving the soil moisture holding capacity wallander et al 2013 in the usa the use of agricultural plastic increased from 0 2 million tons in 1994 0 5 million tons in 2001 lawrence 2007 and nearly 28 8 is used for plastic mulching the relatively low yield variability suggests that drought impacts have been minimized in the wgr of the usa similar measures have been applied in other regions birthal and hazrana 2019 fao et al 2018 gleeson et al 2020 for example in western europe 0 5 million tons of plastic mulch was used in 1997 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 a higher groundwater table may also help mitigate the impacts of drought on wheat production since wheat can access water from a higher groundwater saturated zone during drought conditions zipper et al 2015 in such regions groundwater exploitation is limited if no or less irrigation is applied such as in russia argentina ukraine and canada 4 3 improving drought resilience improved farmland management practices also help create a better drought resilient wheat production system these practices may include early seeding and filling seedlings in time using a controlled tile drainage system sunohara et al 2016 accessing drought early warning information and buying crop insurance li et al 2018 these practices are commonly used in australia russia ukraine and the usa burrell et al 2017 wallander et al 2013 continued advances in plant breeding and genetics for developing more drought tolerant crops will also contribute to reducing drought vulnerability manavalan et al 2009 varshney et al 2018 most of the wheat varieties currently cultivated in russia are the same as those used 20 years ago however it is difficult to find comparable practices for the 12 wgrs included in this study only a small share of the wheat cultivated area was irrigated in france and this area increased from 8 28 in the 1980s to 14 17 in the 2010s table 2 another study showed that only 1 3 of the area was irrigated in 2000 increasing to 3 6 in 2010 loubier et al 2013 however absolute adacs were higher than 45 9 in the last three decades and wheat yields have improved significantly since the 1980s indicating that the wgr in france has a strong ability to withstand climate threats previous studies have shown that heat and water stress indices are not directly related to wheat production anomalies and french wheat production can be more negatively affected by excess water than by droughts zampieri et al 2017 the combination of abnormally warm temperatures in late autumn 2015 and abnormally wet conditions in the following spring led to its most extreme wheat yield loss in 2016 ben ari et al 2018 dry spring conditions generally have a positive impact on wheat with a lower possibility of disease lecerf et al 2019 therefore it seems that the wgr in france is tolerant to drought impacts determining what factors played a role in reducing the drought impact requires further study and will help other regions design drought mitigation schemes social stability and changes in land tenure systems might explain the regional variation in the magnitude of success of drought mitigation efforts the drought mitigation efforts introduced in the 1990s have steadily succeeded in the transition countries of russia ukraine kazakhstan and romania the changes in the land tenure system and the increased amount of fertilizer use can partially explain the reasons for improved drought resilience in russia and ukraine since 2005 the russian government has also increased subsidies liefert and liefert 2012 institutional reforms have helped to overcome institutional constraints in major food producing areas swinnen et al 2017 after a series of rural reforms were introduced in china in the 1980s the impact of drought mitigation measures has significantly magnified and has remained high ever since farm size has also played a critical role in agricultural sustainability ren et al 2019 china s agriculture is characterized by a small scale farming system with an average farm size of less than 1 2 ha while the average farm size in many developed countries is much larger approximately 40 ha in france and 180 ha in the usa adamopoulos and restuccia 2014 operating scales also affect the feasibility of adopting drought mitigation measures nevertheless the relationships between social systems and the overall drought mitigation measure and the possibility of their adoption are far from being well understood individually therefore overall assessment is recommended improving the drought resistance capability from wheat physiological characteristics is another effective drought mitigating method including breeding and use of osmolyte breeding of drought tolerance wheat has grown to be a rapid transregional measure to increase drought mitigation ability khan et al 2019 based on applying genetic modification recent drought tolerance wheat species have deeper larger root and lower transpiration from reduced leaf size and smaller stomatal conductance which exhibits stronger drought tolerance capability in dryland environment khadka et al 2020 li et al 2021 considering the rapid effects of wheat breeding argentina has approved drought tolerance wheat species in 2020 and the mitigation effects remains to be seen by rapid breeding and cultivation drought tolerant wheat seeds could be transported and quickly distributed to farmlands under drought threats with good characteristics of drought resistance wheat breeding method has the potential to achieve higher benefits than other mitigation methods osmoregulation helps crop to sustain water withdraw capability from low water potential environment and can enhance drought tolerance of wheat ashraf et al 2011 exerting exogenous various compounds such as organic osmolytes has gained great attention as it s more efficient and quick than breeding to improve drought tolerance of crops and reducing the damage caused by drought 5 conclusions our study compared the performances of drought mitigation measures practiced in 12 major wgrs of the world and their evolution over the last four decades this study performed spatially and temporally coherent change analyses of drought characteristics with or without human intervention the study confirms that the changes in drought characteristics can be used to explain the performance of drought mitigation schemes eliminating confusion of yield improvements the results suggest that the drought affected area in the study regions has decreased by approximately 28 5 accounting for 55 of the drought affected area with significant regional differences ranging from 28 to 79 in the 12 wgrs drought mitigation measures succeeded in reducing the percentage of the drought affected area from 14 5 in the 1980s to 28 5 in the 2010 s among all regions considered in this study the drought mitigation measures practiced in china and india are the most effective in combatting droughts followed by france and ukraine the percentage of drought affected area changed only slightly in argentina and canada where wheat is not prone to droughts irrigation should be used as a drought mitigation tool in dryland areas water conservation measures are suitable for both dry and wet areas france and ukraine are good examples to be followed to comprehensively quantify the impact of drought mitigation

9291,drought is considered one of the key barriers influencing wheat production and various adaptation schemes are practiced globally to mitigate drought impacts however it is difficult to precisely assess the performances of drought mitigation measures especially when multiple measures are implemented simultaneously here a remote sensing based agricultural drought affected area change index adac was applied to assess the performance of drought mitigation schemes which separates and avoids confusion between performances of drought mitigation and wheat yield improvement the results revealed the historical performance changes and regional differences under drought mitigation measures in 12 major wheat growing regions wgrs of the world the drought mitigation efforts have steadily succeeded with a reduction in the drought affected area of approximately 14 5 in the 1980s and 28 5 in the last decade relatively 55 of drought affected areas are alleviated in the 12 wgrs however there are significant regional differences ranging from 28 to 79 in the 12 wgrs the drought mitigation measures implemented in the wgrs of china and india followed by france and ukraine are more effective than other regions while a few are still declining by further evaluating the effects of short term and long term drought mitigation strategies taken in the wgrs we found that irrigation is the main drought mitigation measure in dryland while measures such as conservation tillage are of great value for yield stability for both dry and wet areas the results of this study improve the understanding of the regional performance of drought mitigation schemes and will help stakeholders to select appropriate measures keywords drought wheat alleviation mitigation remote sensing yield data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wheat is the world s primary field crop accounting for 30 of the world s total harvested cereal area and approximately 26 of total cereal production fao 2019 the water requirement of wheat is relatively low compared to that of other staple crops pereira et al 2021 and wheat has the ability to withstand substantial reductions in water availability over relatively long periods of time daryanto et al 2016 making wheat an important crop in rainfed or dryland areas trnka et al 2019 globally wheat is the first rainfed crop and the second irrigated crop after rice in terms of production lobell 2014 shiferaw et al 2013 drought is considered one of the key barriers influencing wheat production lesk et al 2016 reynolds et al 2016 zampieri et al 2017 globally climate variability accounts for approximately one third of the observed wheat yield changes ray et al 2015 but the degree of yield variance has also changed over time considering that wheat production has increased due to adaptive measures supported by irrigation drought tolerant varieties conservation programs and early warning systems without the application of climate adaptation or drought mitigation measures up to 60 of wheat cultivation will face severe water shortages by the end of the century trnka et al 2019 recent evidence suggests that variations in agricultural prices are linked to the occurrence of large scale droughts schewe et al 2017 drought was one of the key drivers of the 2007 2008 world food price spikes headey 2011 it is important to understand the effects of existing measures in adapting to climate variability particularly extreme weather events such as droughts chen et al 2014 without human intervention natural climate variability controls the amount of water that can be expected at any given location aghakouchak et al 2021 drought is a climatic event that cannot be prevented but interventions can help mitigate the negative impacts of droughts solh and van ginkel 2014 agricultural drought refers to the decline in soil moisture over a period of time which leads to crop failure mishra and singh 2010 however actual agricultural drought is the result of an interplay between a natural event and human interventions agricultural drought impacts are minimized or the actual agricultural drought may not occur if drought mitigation measures are appropriately implemented in time to preserve soil moisture and meet the crop water requirements van loon et al 2016 wu et al 2020 even after meteorological drought occurs from a significant reduction in precipitation hayes et al 2012 pablos et al 2017 the agricultural drought impacts could also be exacerbated by overuse and poor management of scarce water resources aghakouchak et al 2015

impact of drought mitigation measures lobell et al 2015 yang et al 2020 globally the attainable irrigated wheat yields are 34 9 higher than the rainfed yields wang et al 2021 irrigation increased the total biomass yield in the u s high plains by an average of 51 over 1960 2007 suarez et al 2019 in india wheat yields increased by 13 in the 2000s after irrigation became available zaveri and lobell 2019 planting alternative varieties of drought enduring crops or adopting beneficial field management practices can also help reduce drought induced yield loss by 10 15 li et al 2018 government support that may include releasing early warning information and providing postdisaster technical and financial services has significantly improved farmers ability to combat droughts but such improvements have rarely been quantified chen et al 2014 wang et al 2015 however it is difficult to precisely assess the performance of a drought mitigation measure especially when multiple measures are implemented simultaneously while avoiding mixing the drought mitigation performance with crop production improvements such as water productivity therefore agricultural drought characteristics are used to quantify the performance of drought mitigation measures wu et al 2020 evaluating the performance of drought mitigation measures and their spatial and temporal implications is critical for drought mitigation planning this information can help farmers government agencies and other stakeholders to understand the availability and gaps in drought mitigation measures and can support the development and implementation of better adaptation schemes this in turn will guide field county and national level officials to identify gaps in their drought management strategies thus improving global food security zipper et al 2016 the present study analyzes the historical changes in drought characteristics and the performances of drought mitigation measures practiced in 12 representative wgrs across the globe such an analysis will increase the understanding of the regional performances of drought mitigation measures and will help stakeholders select adaptation measures 2 materials and methods twelve representative wgrs with various climate systems across the world fig 1 and table 1 were selected for this study accounting for 71 of the global wheat growing area 71 of global wheat production and more than 82 of global wheat exports fao 2019 the most intensive wheat cultivation occurs in the temperate latitudes of both hemispheres wheat is most prevalent in northern china the great plains of the united states the canadian prairie provinces the indus and the upper ganges valleys along the kazakhstan and russian border in southern australia throughout europe including turkey

data and models crop calendar dataset index php sacks et al 2010 the seeding and harvesting dates were extracted from the map and averaged for each wheat growing zone the major growing months for every wheat zone were used for further analysis table 2 the soil water balance is further used for water supply and demand in the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 the pdsi was found to be highly correlated with the soil moisture differences within the uppermost 1 m according to site observations thus site observations are usually adopted to quantify agricultural droughts dai 2011 but can reflect only the changes in soil moisture caused by climate change mu et al 2013 and do not consider the impacts of drought mitigation measures the pdsi dataset used in this study was acquired from the terraclimate http www climatologylab org terraclimate html dataset supported by the university of idaho this dataset is monthly global pdsi data covering the period of 1980 2018 at a 4 km resolution the pdsi is calculated using precipitation and potential evapotranspiration with the penman monteith equation van der schrier et al 2011 wu et al 2021 the pdsi ranges from 10 to 10 representing extremely dry and extremely wet conditions respectively we considered the pdsi drought area percentage higher than 99 as a wall to wall drought and derived its occurrence times accordingly table 1 which means that nearly all pixels within the wgr were lower than the pdsi drought threshold the wgrs in france romania australia and china are prone to wall to wall drought while france and romania may be related to the size of the region the vegetation health index vhi is one of the most commonly used indicators for monitoring the extent of a drought gomes et al 2017 kogan et al 2019 the vhi reflects the actual crop stress considers the local biophysical soil slope and climatic conditions garcía león et al 2019 and is strongly related to crop yield especially in the key stage of crop growth kogan et al 2012 yang et al 2018 the vhi dataset was acquired from the global vegetation health products https www star nesdis noaa gov smcd emb vci vh vh ftp php provided by the center for satellite applications and research national oceanic and atmospheric administration usa noaa star this dataset is a global weekly dataset covering 1982 2018 at a 4 km resolution the vhi can be regarded as an indicator of actual agricultural drought kogan 2002 it ranges from 0 to 100 representing stressed crop conditions to good crop conditions the country level yield fertilizer and cropland irrigation data table 2 were acquired from faostat fao 2019 the fertilizer data include nitrogen n phosphate p2o5 and potash k2o which are converted to wheat fertilizer use based on the nutrient ratio of 200 55 252 for n p2o5 and k2o roy et al 2006 the pdsi describes soil moisture changes that drive climate variability but does not consider the impact of human activities such as irrigation and the planting of drought tolerant varieties therefore the pdsi can reflect agricultural drought only under natural conditions the vhi is a remote sensing data product that monitors crop stress directly which reflects the impact of climate variability and human activities therefore the difference in the drought extent detected by the two indicators can be used to describe the effects of drought mitigation measures in alleviating drought here the proportion is used instead of the actual drought affected area to facilitate comparisons between regions the difference in the proportion of the agricultural drought affected area adac based on the pdsi and the vhi is calculated and averaged over four decades since the 1980s using the following equation 1 adac i pa vhi i β pa pdsi i α where i represents the wheat growing season α is the threshold value for determining a drought condition using the pdsi and β is the threshold value for determining a drought condition using the vhi we set α as 45 and β as 0 5 wu et al 2020 pa is the proportion of cropland area affected by drought derived from either the pdsi for meteorological drought or the vhi for agricultural drought waterlogging and water borne diseases in addition to water stress could also lower the vhi value during the crop growing season thus only when a drought was detected with the pdsi would the vhi be used to detect whether the drought pixel represented an actual drought which could minimize the impact of vhi anomalies caused by factors other than water stress 3 results fig 2 shows the pdsi and the vhi values averaged over the producing area for the four decades for the 12 wgrs as detected by the pdsi the wgrs in australia experienced drought in this century and china and india experienced drought in most years while argentina canada kazakhstan russia ukraine and the usa experienced wet conditions in most years romania and turkey had dry and wet conditions alternatively over years while in france wet or dry conditions could occur in continuity table 3 shows the proportion of the drought affected area detected by the pdsi and vhi as well as their difference adac the yield coefficient of variation and the annual trend slope over the four decades for the 12 major wgrs in the world fig 3 depicts the temporal development of the agricultural drought area proportion as derived from the pdsi and vhi and their relative changes as well as from the decadal averages of the adac there were regional differences in the temporal development patterns of drought among the 12 wgrs with year to year variability on average approximately 51 4 of the wheat growing area suffered from natural agricultural droughts in the 2010s after human intervention this figure decreased to 22 9 with changes of 28 5 in the 2010s increasing from 14 5 in the 1980s however regional differences in the reduction in drought affected areas were significant ranging from 57 to 11 accounting for 28 55 of drought affected areas in the 2010s among the 12 wgrs although different trends of drying and wetting conditions existed over the study areas the adac declined significantly in the current century compared to the first 2 decades 3 1 drought characteristics in 12 wgrs in temperate climates with sufficient precipitation during the wheat growing seasons such as argentina canada kazakhstan russia ukraine and the usa natural droughts derived from the pdsi were moderate with affected areas less than 50 most of the time indicating that severe droughts do not occur frequently in these countries but occasionally such as in 2010 in russia and ukraine loboda et al 2017 as well as in 2018 in the usa and in 2017 in france canada had better agrometeorological conditions in the last decade with only 14 of the area affected by a severe drought russia and ukraine worsened in the last decade with more than 60 of wheat growing cropland suffering from water stress table 3 fig 2 in contrast drier areas in australia france china romania and turkey suffered more severe droughts with more than 50 of the area affected most of the time australia china and france are more vulnerable to natural agricultural drought with maximum affected areas of 68 77 and 72 respectively over the last four decades in the last decade china and france have suffered severe droughts with more than 60 of the wheat growing area affected the australian drought shifted from a moderate to a severe category at the beginning of the 21st century france had the poorest agrometeorological conditions in the last three decades romania suffered a severe drought during the 2000 s table 3 the wgrs in india are located in wet and warm regions wang et al 2021 during the last four decades india has been vulnerable to natural agricultural drought affecting up to 75 of the wheat growing area recently india suffered severe droughts in 2002 2009 and 2012 national rainfed area authority 2013 an actual agricultural drought derived from the vhi is quite different from that derived from the pdsi overall approximately 23 of the wheat growing area was actually affected by drought over the last four decades showing a reduction from 29 in the 1980s to 23 in the 2010s australia was most affected by drought in the 21st century with more than 45 of the wheat area being affected in other regions less than 25 of the wheat area was affected by drought during the last decade this shows that the actual agricultural drought area is less than the natural drought area even without human interventions 3 2 drought mitigation in 12 wgrs the extent of the reduction in the agricultural drought affected area adac varied among the 12 wgrs the adac decreased from 14 6 in the 1980s to 28 5 in the 2010s globally during the last decade the absolute reductions in the adac for china france and ukraine were 50 57 and 49 6 respectively higher than those for other places followed by india 40 5 and russia 36 5 china and france have had greater adac reductions since the 1990s the reduction in adac was low in india russia turkey ukraine and the usa in the last century but has improved recently meaning that the drought resilience capacity has improved in these regions russia and ukraine experienced a 20 decrease in the drought affected area during the last decade compared with the preceding decade for argentina and canada this change was very low over the last four decades only approximately 11 in the last decade indicating weak capacities in adapting to the negative influences of agricultural droughts fig 2 shows the time series of the drought affected area for the 12 major wgrs the drought affected area derived from the pdsi departed gradually from the vhi these departures occurred in china in 1991 india in 2001 romania in 2007 russia in 2005 and ukraine in 2012 and the departures amplified gradually there was no obvious departure in other countries actual agricultural drought conditions in china and india have improved since 1984 and 1987 respectively the pdsi shows that china had the poorest agrometeorological conditions in 2000 and india in 2002 but the vhi detected these conditions or agricultural droughts with significantly different success rates the ndvi has remained stable since the 1980s and fertilizer use and yields have strong increasing trends this leads to the inference that the wheat yield had a significant relationship with the adac since 1980s china and india experienced a sharp increase of fertilizer use and built large areas of irrigation system which helped mitigating the impact of drought turkey had a trend similar to china s and showed a gradual improvement in drought conditions as supported by the ndvi fertilizer use and yield trends 2 13 per year australia s drought resilience has remained largely unchanged since the 1980s with adac ranging between 11 and 22 australia experienced a severe drought with more than 63 of the area being affected by a natural drought and 45 of the area being affected by an actual drought in the beginning of the new century the yield trend agreed with the trend in the drought affected area 0 56 per year rather than with those in the ndvi and fertilizer use france faced the poorest agrometeorological conditions during the last four decades table 1 fig 3 and showed no improvement as determined by the pdsi analysis at the same time the drought affected area as determined by vhi analysis has decreased since the beginning of the 1980s with a maximum adac value of 57 the development of water saving irrigation and rainwater recycling technology has helped reducing the impact area of actual agricultural drought a positive trend for ndvi and a negative trend for fertilizer usage were also observed the increase in wheat yields agreed with the trends in the reductions in drought affected areas in france 2 86 per year russia and ukraine have had similar trends since the 1990s during the last decade the drought affected area as determined by the pdsi analysis was 62 for russia and 73 for ukraine however these percentages changed to 25 and 23 respectively when vhi analysis was used leading to changes of 36 5 and 49 6 respectively data for russia showed that since 2005 there has been a marked increase in the drought affected area as derived from the pdsi analysis which indicates poor agrometeorological conditions in general at the same time the drought affected area as determined by the vhi analysis has decreased since 2010 a positive trend was observed for ndvi since 2004 and for fertilizer usage since 2010 all of these observations agreed well with the increase in wheat yields which suggests that the main factor causing yield changes in russia was the reduction in the drought affected area rather than the poor agrometeorological conditions a significant reduction of 2 80 per year ukraine has had a very significant improvement since the 2000s 2 11 per year kazakhstan and romania similar to russia have had a significant improvement in drought mitigation since the 1990s but the mitigation effect has declined in the last decade as a result of improved agrometeorological conditions wgrs in the united states have been less affected than those in other regions by both natural agricultural drought and actual drought with less than 45 and 28 of the affected areas respectively over the past four decades in the 1980s the proportion of drought area decline was only 6 4 but it was 26 in the 2000s and 17 in the 2010s compared with the other regions the improvement in drought conditions in the united states is relatively low the wheat yield trend agreed more with the reduction in the drought affected area 1 77 per year than with other factors such as ndvi or fertilizer use argentina and canada are the two countries that showed no improvement in drought conditions over the last four decades with adac being less than 16 5 and 26 5 respectively argentina is the only country for which adac has increased since the 1980s meaning that the drought mitigation or adaptation impact has been on a downward trend in fact the crop growing season is not prone to drought which causes a lower vhi value fig 3 the wheat yield variability in kazakhstan is the highest among wgrs with a cv of 20 3 in the 2010s and has remained at a high level since the 1990s followed by the values in romania russia ukraine australia france and argentina with cvs greater than 10 in the 2010s table 3 interannual variability in wheat yields increased with increasing adac although not significantly for the 12 wheat growing zones collectively fig 4 in the 1980s the yield variability did not increase with adac but it increased significantly in the 1990s and the 2000s this increasing trend slowed down in the 2010s when the regions experienced more severe droughts than in the preceding decades table 4 listed the correlation between pdsi vhi and adac derived drought areas pdsi and vhi for each decade is calculated as average the bold numbers represent significant correlation pdsi have a significant positive correlation with vhi and significant negative correlation with adac during most periods while vhi and adac has quite unsignificant correlation which indicates that adac is more influenced by pdsi as meteorological drought is the largest influential factor on adac the nonsignificant correlation between vhi and adac is also an indicator that there exists large divergence between all 12 wgrs which is consistent with previous results 3 3 mitigation of extreme droughts extreme droughts occurred in russia in 2010 the usa in 2018 france in 2012 china in 2009 and india in 2002 table 5 russia experienced its most severe drought during the last half century in 2010 this drought caused russia s wheat yield to be 14 6 lower than the 1992 2018 trend and 17 2 lower than the yield in the previous year fao 2019 wegren 2011 and only 10 5 adac of drought affected areas were alleviated indicating the poor effects of drought mitigation fig 5a drought coverage derived from the pdsi peaked at 63 5 in the usa in february 2018 the actual agricultural drought was severe with a vhi value of 37 2 and approximately 28 4 adac of drought affected areas were mitigated leading to a 3 9 reduction in wheat yield in 2018 compared with that in 2017 http cloud cropwatch com cn fig 5b in the spring of 2012 a severe drought occurred in france france employed adequate drought mitigation measures bringing relief to approximately 94 5 adac of the drought affected area and fao statistics suggested that french wheat yield increased by 7 4 compared with that in 2011 fig 5c indicating that wet conditions instead of drought cause crop stress in the wgr of france ben ari et al 2018 in china the 2009 drought influenced 6 04 million hectares of crops zhang et al 2012 the pdsi drought area was 91 1 for wheat growing cropland and the actual drought area was decreased by 71 9 fig 5d which led to a wheat yield reduction of 0 48 compared to 2008 owing to a 21 5 deficit in seasonal rainfall india experienced a major drought in 2002 bhat 2006 more than 86 of the wheat growing area was influenced but 51 89 was successfully protected from drought fig 5e with a wheat yield 1 99 higher than that in 2001 fig 6 shows the relation of adac and wheat yield changes over 5 extreme drought events china the usa and india had similar wheat yield change percentages under different adac levels based on nonstatistic yield data fig 6b the adac is significantly correlated with yield changes during extreme drought events it is worth noting that in contrast to the decade analysis the adac has a low correlation with the yield cv fig 4 and the adac reflects the drought mitigation effects independent of yield increasing measures the purpose of drought mitigation measures in extreme drought years is to stabilize yield changes from previous normal years the high correlation of adac to yield changes in extreme years meets the expectations of the major purposes of drought mitigation measures 4 discussion agricultural drought is the result of natural water variability climate change human activities and microclimate condition changes due to changes in land and water management aghakouchak et al 2021 therefore there are significant regional differences in drought characteristics and performances of drought mitigation measures traditionally assessment of the performance of drought mitigation measures attempts to describe the effect of a measure in isolation usually observing the changes and results before and after implementation using yield and or water productivity due to the compounding feedback that governs drought state and behavior it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate the effect of a drought mitigation measure and determine which measure plays a leading role but through regional comparison it is possible to understand which region performs better and determine which measures or combinations thereof work using the changes in the proportion of cropland areas affected by drought derived from the pdsi and vhi we analyzed the performances of the drought mitigation measures for 12 major wgrs of the world it was found that the mitigation measures have not fully alleviated the impact of drought in these wgrs the proportion of drought affected area decreased by approximately 28 5 globally accounting for 55 of the drought affected area and drought mitigation efforts have steadily succeeded with the absolute adac increasing from 14 5 to 28 5 over the past four decades the vhi analysis revealed that drought still persists in approximately 22 9 of the wgrs whether an onset of a drought event would cause a disaster for wheat growth depends on both the severity of the event and the vulnerability of the ecosystems experiencing it lesk et al 2016 we have found that there are large regional variabilities in the performance of drought mitigation efforts for all 12 regions studied the adaptation or mitigation schemes were more effective in combating droughts in china india and france argentina and canada apparently did not show improvements table 3 in addition different temporal trends were observed while turkey russia china and india have shown continuous improvement in their drought mitigation performance during the last four decades australia and canada have not exhibited any improvement and argentina s performance has even worsened these regional variations in drought mitigation performance could be a combined result of varying drought mitigation measures and climate conditions prevalent in different regions the relationship between adac and wheat yield variation is positive although not significant in the decade period fig 4 but significant at extreme drought events fig 6 which suggests that the wheat yield and variations are not good indicators to assess the effectiveness of drought mitigation schemes some measures such as irrigation could improve wheat yield hornbeck and keskin 2014 suarez et al 2019 zaveri and lobell 2019 and change drought characteristics since irrigation stabilized the climate extremes and variability which led to yield reductions in rainfed crops but not irrigated crops troy et al 2015 the same benefits apply for mulching and water conservation measures uwizeyimana et al 2018 yan et al 2015 and increases in planting density li et al 2020 solh and van ginkel 2014 some measures such as the development of new varieties of crops qin et al 2015b simtowe et al 2019 and the use of fertilizers pesticides xiao and tao 2014 and small farming practices burrell et al 2017 dobler morales and bocco 2021 could improve yield without directly changing drought characteristics therefore the changes in drought characteristics should be used to assess the performance of drought mitigation schemes wu et al 2020 this approach can avoid confusion between drought mitigation performance and wheat yield improvement 4 1 drought mitigation measures in dryland areas dryland wheat is more vulnerable to drought than irrigated wheat daryanto et al 2016 under drier conditions irrigation is the first choice in combating drought yin et al 2020 zaveri and lobell 2019 as detected by the pdsi wgrs in australia china and india experienced drought in most years which required annual irrigation while those in france romania and turkey required intermittent irrigation since drought alternated over years regions without irrigation suffered more yield losses than regions with irrigation lesk et al 2016 the yield difference between rainfed or dryland and irrigated wheat was 34 9 globally wang et al 2021 water availability for wheat can be further improved by rainfall water harvesting by collecting rain water in on farm reservoirs or catchments for later use by crops biazin et al 2012 china and india have steadily improved their drought mitigation capacity and yield variability since the 1980s the relevant investment and policy interventions have helped expand irrigated areas steadily during the last four decades even under strained water availability zhou et al 2020 china s total irrigated area and the annual irrigation water consumption increased by 10 2 and 29 74 respectively between 1982 and 2015 the irrigated area increased mainly for wheat produced in northern china yin et al 2020 where the irrigation rate was 76 the highest among the 12 wgrs additionally nearly 70 of irrigation was based on groundwater resources wang et al 2019 which led to overexploitation qiu 2010 in addition the chinese government has enhanced its efforts to encourage farmers to adopt water saving technologies which improve irrigation efficiency and management policies all of these measures have increased capabilities to better deal with the increasing water scarcity and support the growth of wheat production in china in india there has been a constant focus on improving drought mitigation measures such as expanding irrigation and rainwater harvesting developing small reservoirs or village ponds and improving soil conservation and waste water recycling for irrigation rao and gopinath 2016 for decades the indian government s policy has been to expand irrigation to cope with drought and thus improve agricultural productivity although the area under wheat cultivation remained stable between 1966 and 2009 the irrigated area increased rapidly zaveri and lobell 2019 with a current irrigation rate of 41 in the wgr although australia suffered severe drought conditions its irrigated area of cropland remains only 8 3 table 2 previous studies have shown that the adoption of new drought resistant wheat varieties and better crop rotation techniques and the application of optimum fertilizer rates caused wheat yields to almost double between 1980 and 2011 burrell et al 2017 in addition changes in farming practices apparently decoupled ndvi trends from rainfall patterns in western australia burrell et al 2017 which was confirmed by the improvement in yield variability however the currently high level of yield variability suggests table 3 that australia needs to implement more measures to combat drought dry and wet conditions alternate over the years in the wgr of romania the high yield variability can be explained by the soil moisture availability from april may and then from november december lecerf et al 2019 the high variability in wheat yield in romania with a cv of 24 89 in the 2000s and 18 72 in the 2010s table 3 ranking second after that in kazakhstan indicates that more drought mitigation measures are needed while irrigation has been used as an effective tool for reducing drought impacts dwindling water resources in some regions elliott et al 2014 cast doubt on the feasibility of irrigation to continue to increase wheat yields on a global scale groundwater abstraction has already exceeded the sustainable yield in many aquifers such as the high plains in the usa scanlon et al 2012 wada et al 2012 2010 north china plain qiu 2010 and india famiglietti 2014 therefore when using irrigation as a short term drought mitigation measure it is necessary to consider the limits of the amount of groundwater available wu et al 2014 and to explore other measures to enhance drought resilience mulching is used as an alternative method to mitigate drought stress mulching which includes covering the soil surface with cover crops crop residues or plastic films prevents water losses from soil reduces soil water evaporation helps preserve root zone moisture during the drought period liakatas et al 1986 and improves crop defenses against annual and seasonal droughts even in relatively humid regions sun et al 2020 china is the largest cropland mulching country lal 2018 the use of plastic film mulching in agriculture has greatly increased from 6 thousand tons in 1982 2 5 million tons in 2018 representing a 400 fold increase changrong et al 2014 the area of cropland covered with mulch increased from 0 12 mha in 1982 4 9 mha in 1991 11 0 mha in 2001 and 17 7 mha in 2018 national bureau of statistics 2018 among the major wheat growing provinces in china hebei henan and shandong the mulch covered cropland area currently exceeds 0 7 mha in 2012 13 of china s cropland was mulched which accounted for nearly 60 of the global mulched area mulching has increased yields by approximately 20 globally qin et al 2015a and by approximately 18 in china tan et al 2019 and has reduced evaporative water loss by approximately 3 on the north china plain yan et al 2015 crop yield increased 77 9 under full mulching and 38 9 under partial mulching irrigation and mulching practices have helped china reduce yield variability conservation agriculture has also been applied to wheat crops under a rice maize wheat rotation on the indo gangetic plains bhan and behera 2014 resulting in india achieving the second lowest yield variability 4 2 drought mitigation measures under wet conditions temperate zones usually experience sufficient precipitation during wheat growing seasons and infrequently suffer water stress therefore irrigation is not considered essential and is not a key factor contributing to obtaining good yields even after mild droughts occur argentina canada kazakhstan russia ukraine and the usa have relatively low percentages less than 17 of irrigated lands table 2 yield anomalies between irrigated wheat and dryland rainfed wheat were not significant in the usa which means that irrigation was not an effective tool to improve wheat s ability to withstand climate risks in the central united states zhang et al 2015 although large scale irrigation development may be unrealistic due to significantly increased fertilizer use since the late 1990s swinnen et al 2017 ukraine and russia had relatively high drought mitigation capacity with absolute adac exceeding 49 6 and 36 5 respectively during the 2010s while regions in the other four countries had lower absolute adac values less than 17 4 for the usa in the 2010s table 3 during dry conditions which sometimes occur wheat yield depends on soil moisture reserves therefore conserving soil moisture is one of the major drought mitigation measures there are a number of methods that can be used to conserve soil moisture bhan and behera 2014 kosmowski 2018 qin et al 2015a zipper et al 2015 such as mulching which relies on providing some kind of cover for the soil to reduce evaporation and prevent soil exposure to direct sunlight yan et al 2015 in addition the methods used for improving soil quality and conservation will help conserve soil moisture and thereby mitigate droughts the conservation tillage practice where the crop residue is left on the soil to reduce evaporation and protect the soil surface from wind erosion direct sunlight and heavy rain impacts increases the soil s capacity to absorb and retain water water conservation is also possible by minimizing soil disturbance and reducing nonbeneficial evaporative water loss from the soil surface stagnari et al 2014 canadian and us farmers have improved their drought resilience or mitigation measures over time these measures include developing and adopting drought tolerant crop varieties implementing no till sowing and fallowing and leaving crop residues after the harvest wallander et al 2013 drought mitigation measures used in the united states include developing an early warning system for drought developing drought resistant varieties improving irrigation efficiency enhancing drought resilience and improving the soil moisture holding capacity wallander et al 2013 in the usa the use of agricultural plastic increased from 0 2 million tons in 1994 0 5 million tons in 2001 lawrence 2007 and nearly 28 8 is used for plastic mulching the relatively low yield variability suggests that drought impacts have been minimized in the wgr of the usa similar measures have been applied in other regions birthal and hazrana 2019 fao et al 2018 gleeson et al 2020 for example in western europe 0 5 million tons of plastic mulch was used in 1997 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 a higher groundwater table may also help mitigate the impacts of drought on wheat production since wheat can access water from a higher groundwater saturated zone during drought conditions zipper et al 2015 in such regions groundwater exploitation is limited if no or less irrigation is applied such as in russia argentina ukraine and canada 4 3 improving drought resilience improved farmland management practices also help create a better drought resilient wheat production system these practices may include early seeding and filling seedlings in time using a controlled tile drainage system sunohara et al 2016 accessing drought early warning information and buying crop insurance li et al 2018 these practices are commonly used in australia russia ukraine and the usa burrell et al 2017 wallander et al 2013 continued advances in plant breeding and genetics for developing more drought tolerant crops will also contribute to reducing drought vulnerability manavalan et al 2009 varshney et al 2018 most of the wheat varieties currently cultivated in russia are the same as those used 20 years ago however it is difficult to find comparable practices for the 12 wgrs included in this study only a small share of the wheat cultivated area was irrigated in france and this area increased from 8 28 in the 1980s to 14 17 in the 2010s table 2 another study showed that only 1 3 of the area was irrigated in 2000 increasing to 3 6 in 2010 loubier et al 2013 however absolute adacs were higher than 45 9 in the last three decades and wheat yields have improved significantly since the 1980s indicating that the wgr in france has a strong ability to withstand climate threats previous studies have shown that heat and water stress indices are not directly related to wheat production anomalies and french wheat production can be more negatively affected by excess water than by droughts zampieri et al 2017 the combination of abnormally warm temperatures in late autumn 2015 and abnormally wet conditions in the following spring led to its most extreme wheat yield loss in 2016 ben ari et al 2018 dry spring conditions generally have a positive impact on wheat with a lower possibility of disease lecerf et al 2019 therefore it seems that the wgr in france is tolerant to drought impacts determining what factors played a role in reducing the drought impact requires further study and will help other regions design drought mitigation schemes social stability and changes in land tenure systems might explain the regional variation in the magnitude of success of drought mitigation efforts the drought mitigation efforts introduced in the 1990s have steadily succeeded in the transition countries of russia ukraine kazakhstan and romania the changes in the land tenure system and the increased amount of fertilizer use can partially explain the reasons for improved drought resilience in russia and ukraine since 2005 the russian government has also increased subsidies liefert and liefert 2012 institutional reforms have helped to overcome institutional constraints in major food producing areas swinnen et al 2017 after a series of rural reforms were introduced in china in the 1980s the impact of drought mitigation measures has significantly magnified and has remained high ever since farm size has also played a critical role in agricultural sustainability ren et al 2019 china s agriculture is characterized by a small scale farming system with an average farm size of less than 1 2 ha while the average farm size in many developed countries is much larger approximately 40 ha in france and 180 ha in the usa adamopoulos and restuccia 2014 operating scales also affect the feasibility of adopting drought mitigation measures nevertheless the relationships between social systems and the overall drought mitigation measure and the possibility of their adoption are far from being well understood individually therefore overall assessment is recommended improving the drought resistance capability from wheat physiological characteristics is another effective drought mitigating method including breeding and use of osmolyte breeding of drought tolerance wheat has grown to be a rapid transregional measure to increase drought mitigation ability khan et al 2019 based on applying genetic modification recent drought tolerance wheat species have deeper larger root and lower transpiration from reduced leaf size and smaller stomatal conductance which exhibits stronger drought tolerance capability in dryland environment khadka et al 2020 li et al 2021 considering the rapid effects of wheat breeding argentina has approved drought tolerance wheat species in 2020 and the mitigation effects remains to be seen by rapid breeding and cultivation drought tolerant wheat seeds could be transported and quickly distributed to farmlands under drought threats with good characteristics of drought resistance wheat breeding method has the potential to achieve higher benefits than other mitigation methods osmoregulation helps crop to sustain water withdraw capability from low water potential environment and can enhance drought tolerance of wheat ashraf et al 2011 exerting exogenous various compounds such as organic osmolytes has gained great attention as it s more efficient and quick than breeding to improve drought tolerance of crops and reducing the damage caused by drought 5 conclusions our study compared the performances of drought mitigation measures practiced in 12 major wgrs of the world and their evolution over the last four decades this study performed spatially and temporally coherent change analyses of drought characteristics with or without human intervention the study confirms that the changes in drought characteristics can be used to explain the performance of drought mitigation schemes eliminating confusion of yield improvements the results suggest that the drought affected area in the study regions has decreased by approximately 28 5 accounting for 55 of the drought affected area with significant regional differences ranging from 28 to 79 in the 12 wgrs drought mitigation measures succeeded in reducing the percentage of the drought affected area from 14 5 in the 1980s to 28 5 in the 2010 s among all regions considered in this study the drought mitigation measures practiced in china and india are the most effective in combatting droughts followed by france and ukraine the percentage of drought affected area changed only slightly in argentina and canada where wheat is not prone to droughts irrigation should be used as a drought mitigation tool in dryland areas water conservation measures are suitable for both dry and wet areas france and ukraine are good examples to be followed to comprehensively quantify the impact of drought mitigation

9292,in semi arid areas drought is the main limiting factor for rainfed agriculture vertical rotary subsoiling vrt has been shown to effectively increase soil water storage and so allow crops to resist seasonal drought however there is a lack of reports on the infiltration path and distribution pattern of rainwater in soil under vrt practice the present study used simulated rainfall and visualized the soil profile water distribution and path of vrt subsoiling tillage ss and conventional tillage ct practices twenty four hours after applying simulated rain vertical soil profiles were photographed and staining features used to indicate the infiltration path and distribution of rainwater in the soil our results showed that when rainwater infiltrated into the soil matrix and preferential flows occurred concomitantly under vrt practice and mainly matrix flow for ss and ct practices the vrt increased water infiltration into the soil occurrence of preferential flow and water storage in the soil profile while the soil of ss and ct somewhat hindered the infiltration of water the vrt decreased soil bulk density bd by 9 2 10 3 and increased soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k s by 50 4 70 4 compared with ss and ct moreover vrt significantly increased potato tuber yield by 22 9 36 0 compared with ss and ct in two consecutive years structural equation modeling sem further revealed that vrt increased potato yield was mainly caused by decreasing bd and increasing k s and then increasing water storage in the soil profile these findings suggest that decreased bd and increased k s in vrt practice could be particularly important for infiltration sustaining and supplying of soil water in rainfed areas worldwide which is important for production practices in these areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords vertical rotary subsoiling semi arid areas dye tracer preferential flow soil saturated hydraulic conductivity solanum tuberosum l data availability data

plastic film mulching rfpm is a promising method for coping with drought stress in semi arid areas wei et al 2022 yang et al 2022 k zhang et al 2022 l zhang et al 2022 because rfpm can effectively collect precipitation inhibit evaporation and increase soil moisture realize efficient use of natural precipitation in drylands li et al 2020 f zhang et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 f zhang et al 2017 p zhang et al 2017 p zhang et al 2020 many studies showed that rfpm has significantly increased the yield of potato solanum tuberosum l maize zea mays l wheat triticum aestivum l and other crops by more than 30 on average chai et al 2022 qin et al 2022 k zhang et al 2022 potato as a staple food is widely grown in semi arid areas and even worldwide thus the increase in potato production is crucial for future global food security qin et al 2022 raymundo et al 2018 however seasonal drought caused by the uneven distribution of natural precipitation still restrains potato tuber yield in plastic mulched fields wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2020c moreover soil compaction is another important negative factor affecting potato production due to farmland management e g in sowing or harvesting have required more frequent farming operations using heavy machines liu et al 2010 zhai et al 2017 many studies showed that tillage practices can influence crop yield via such soil properties as structure and water retention which are regarded as some of the most important agricultural management measures acharya and sharma 1994 guan et al 2014 lampurlanés et al 2001 zhai et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a 2020b due to soil properties especially bulk density bd and hydraulic conductivity significantly affected soil water supply capacity bohne and olszta 1992 zhang et al 2020a zhao et al 1997 previous studies have shown that vrt vertical rotary subsoiling combined the advantage of rotary tillage and sub soiling which can better decrease bd and increase pore distribution and has the potential to increase crop yield zhang et al 2020a 2020b zhang et al 2020a showed that compared with conventional tillage ct vrt significantly reduced bd and the soil wilting coefficient and improved swc potato yield and wue in semi arid areas other studies also showed that compared with no tillage vrt significantly increased maize yield and swc and decreased bd in semi arid and semi humid areas zhai et al 2017 in addition vrt can increase the stable soil aggregates soil porosity crop root biomass aboveground biomass and harvest index wang et al 2020 zhai et al 2017 therefore vrt is an effective way to resist seasonal drought stress and increase crop yield however current studies on vrt mainly focus on crop yield soil moisture and soil properties there are no reports on the infiltration path and distribution pattern of rainwater in soil under vrt practice previous studies have shown that the dye tracing method can directly observe the path and distribution of water flow in soil flury and wai 2003 ghodrati and jury 1990 the path and distribution of water flow in the soil were identified by image analysis of photographed dye profiles and further interpretation and calculations cey and rudolph 2009

agriculture facing seasonal drought stress moreover structural equation modeling sem is a powerful multivariate technique found increasingly in ecological research to test and evaluate multivariate causal relationships eisenhauer et al 2015 fan et al 2016 therefore we could construct by sem that the higher potato yield resulting from vrt could be due to it increasing swc through reducing bd and

data and prepare the graphs 3 results 3 1 water flow behavior in soil twenty four hours after applying simulated rain we found that as rainfall increased so did the infiltration depth of rainwater into the soil fig 3 however the infiltration patterns of rainwater differed among the tillage practices this effect was less pronounced when daily rainfall was 5 mm but more pronounced when it was 25 or 50 mm when daily rainfall was 5 mm the stained distribution of the soil profile was similar for different tillage practices when daily rainfall was 25 or 50 mm the vrt treatment showed a soil profile dyed section distributed in a dendritic pattern while under ss and ct treatments there was a continuously distributed vertical profile dyed section fig 3 fig 4 presents the spatial distribution of stained percentage with soil depth when daily rainfall was 5 mm the indexes of dc sa id uid and pf fr did not differ among the tillage practices when daily rainfall was 25 mm under vrt treatment dc sa id uid and pf fr were 27 4 548 0 cm2 30 5 cm 4 4 cm and 60 0 respectively for ss and ct treatments these indexes were all lower than for vrt and similar between ss and ct treatments furthermore when daily rainfall was 50 mm dc sa id and pf fr of vrt were 47 2 824 6 cm2 37 6 cm and 65 2 respectively which were higher than those of ss and ct however the uid of the vrt 5 7 cm treatment was less than that of the ss 9 4 cm and ct 10 6 cm treatments 3 2 swc in dyed regions there was no difference p 0 05 in swc within 0 60 cm under different tillage practices fig 5a and b for precipitation of 5 mm when precipitation was 25 mm 0 10 cm swc was higher in ss and ct than in vrt treatment p 0 05 20 40 cm swc was higher in vrt than in ss and ct treatments p 0 05 and swc showed no significant differences p 0 05 among tillage practices for both 10 20 and 40 60 cm depths fig 5c when precipitation was 50 mm 0 10 cm swc was lower in vrt and ss than in ct treatment p 0 05 10 20 cm swc showed no significant differences p 0 05 among tillage practices and 20 40 and 40 60 cm swc was higher p 0 05 in vrt than in ss and ct treatments p 0 05 fig 5d 3 3 bd and k s in different tillage practices the vrt treatment significantly p 0 05 decreased bd at 0 10 and 10 20 cm soil depth compared to ss and ct but with no significant p 0 05 differences between ss and ct fig 6a at 20 40 cm soil depth the vrt significantly p 0 05 decreased bd compared to ct but with no differences p 0 05 between ss and ct fig 6a at 40 60 cm soil depth bd did not significantly differ p 0 05 among vrt ss and ct treatments at 0 60 cm soil depth vrt reduced bd by 10 3 and 9 2 compared with ct and ss respectively fig 6a the vrt treatment significantly p 0 05 increased k s at 0 10 10 20 and 20 40 cm soil depth compared to ss and ct but with no significant p 0 05 differences between ss and ct fig 6b at 40 60 cm soil depth k s did not significantly differ p 0 05 among vrt ss and ct treatments fig 6b at 0 60 cm soil depth vrt increased k s by 70 4 and 50 4 compared with ct and ss respectively fig 6b 3 4 potato tuber yield in different tillage practices in the two consecutive years vrt significantly increased tuber yield table 2 by 22 9 and 36 0 in 2020 compared with ss and ct respectively and by 27 2 and 35 5 in 2021 compared with ct tuber yield was non significantly higher for ss in 2020 and 2021 compared with ct and ss vrt significantly increased aboveground biomass by 31 5 and 21 1 in 2020 and 29 9 and 24 9 in 2021 respectively table 2 3 5 relationship between potato tuber yield and soil properties potato tuber yield was positively correlated with k s and swc 20 40 cm but negatively correlated with bd fig 7 furthermore dc sa id pf fr and k s were negatively correlated with bd based on spearman s correlation results fig 7 we used sem analysis to explore the impact of k s bd and swc on potato tuber yield fig 8 the sem analysis showed that vrt k s bd and swc jointly explained 67 of the variation in potato tuber yield in detail the vrt mainly had a direct positive effect on k s standard path coefficients spc 0 90 and the vrt had a direct negative effect on bd spc 0 82 the swc mainly had a direct positive effect on potato tuber yield spc 0 82 vrt k s and bd had indirect effect on potato tuber yield therefore vrt significantly increased k s and decreased bd leading to increased swc and significantly increased potato tuber yield compared with ct and ss treatments p 0 001 4 discussion some studies have shown that dye tracer simulation of rainfall can be used to visualize the water distribution and path in the soil profile jiang and li 2015 zhu et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 and van schaik 2009 showed that calculated preferential flow parameters e g id dc uid sa and pf fr based on dye images could assess the extent of preferential flow in the present study when daily rainfall was low 5 mm the stained distribution of the soil profile under different tillage practices was similar for all treatments dc sa id uid and pf fr showed little differences however when the daily rainfall was high 25 or 50 mm under the vrt treatment the dyed soil was distributed in a dendritic pattern while under ss and ct treatments the dyed section was continuously distributed dc sa id and pf fr of vrt were higher than those of ss and ct these results indicate that under vrt treatment when rainfall intensity was low the preferential flow undeveloped and when the rainfall intensity was high the preferential flow developed which is similar to the results of some previous studies guo 2008 wu et al 2009 because the factors affecting preferential flow include rainfall intensity tillage methods soil water content etc jarvis et al 2016 jarvis 2007 vidon and cuadra 2010 yao et al 2017 vrt significantly reduced bd increased k s and increased soil porosity thus promoting the occurrence of preferential flow in addition we also found that when rainwater infiltrated into the soil matrix and preferential flow occurred concomitantly under vrt practice with matrix flow mainly for ss and ct due to the presence of preferential flow could not disaffiliate itself from the occurrence of soil matrix flow jiang et al 2017 the dye tracer imaging approach has been prevailingly applied to observe and assess the soil preferential flow in farmland forest and so on for example chen et al 2022 applied different irrigation quotas and the dye tracing image method to investigate the characteristics of the preferential flow in cotton fields bargues tobella et al 2014 used rainfall simulations and tracer experiments to investigate the effect of trees and associated termite mounds on soil infiltrability and preferential flow therefore this study showed that vrt can promote the formation of preferential flow water infiltration into soil and water movement in dryland farmland ecosystems some previous studies showed that soil moisture and bd were significantly influenced by various tillage practices which played the most important role in soil crop systems jabro et al 2015 qin et al 2008 zhai et al 2017 in the present study after 24 h of simulated precipitation swc was similar under different tillage practices when daily rainfall was low 5 mm when the daily rainfall was high 25 or 50 mm the 0 10 cm swc of the vrt treatment was significantly lower than that of ss and ct when daily rainfall was 50 mm the 0 10 cm swc of ss and ct exceeded the maximum field water capacity but the 20 40 cm swc of vrt was significantly higher than that of ss and ct thus vrt treated soil acted like a sponge increasing water infiltration into the soil and water storage in the soil profile while the soil of ss and ct resisted the infiltration of water fig 5 this result was in agreement with the result of zhai et al 2017 who showed that vrt significantly increased swc in the 20 60 cm soil layer some studies have shown that the amount of water infiltration in the vertical profile directly reflects soil infiltrability in each layer and provides evidence for preferential flow mei et al 2018 furthermore the vrt significantly reduced bd in the 0 40 cm soil layer this result was in agreement with the result of mu et al 2016 who found that deep tillage to 30 cm significantly reduced bd in the 10 30 cm soil layer our study showed that vrt could effectively improve swc and increase the occurrence of preferential flow mainly due to the increase of k s and the reduction of bd with vrt which were continuous and conducive to the rapid movement of water zhang et al 2011 zheng et al 2004 some studies have shown that k s is a key soil hydraulic parameter with a crucial role in modeling water movement processes through the soil profile jačka et al 2014 reynolds et al 2000 a high k s can enhance rainfall infiltration and reduce surface erosion zhu et al 2019 especially in rainfed areas this could be particularly important for infiltration sustaining and supplying of soil water moreover the vrt increased potato tuber yield and aboveground biomass table 2 which is consistent with previous studies yin et al 2022 zhang et al 2020a 2020b this was mainly due to vrt effectively improved soil water conditions and increased water use efficiency yin et al 2022 zhang et al 2020a and thus enhanced potato the drought resistance during the dry season and drought years 5 conclusions the present study vividly illustrated the rainwater infiltration path and distribution in soil under vrt ss and ct practices twenty four hours after applying simulated rain vertical soil profiles were photographed and staining features were used to indicate the infiltration path and distribution of rainwater when rainwater infiltrated into the soil matrix and preferential flows occurred concomitantly for vrt with main matrix flow for ss and ct the vrt increased water infiltration into the soil increased the occurrence of preferential flow and increased water storage in the soil profile while the soil of ss and ct showed some resistance to water infiltration moreover vrt significantly increased potato tuber yield sem further revealed that vrt increased potato yield was mainly caused by decreasing bd and increasing k s and then increasing water storage in the soil profile these findings suggest that vrt practice could be particularly important for infiltration sustaining and supplying of soil water and agricultural production practices facing seasonal drought stress in rainfed areas worldwide the results are of great significance

9292,in semi arid areas drought is the main limiting factor for rainfed agriculture vertical rotary subsoiling vrt has been shown to effectively increase soil water storage and so allow crops to resist seasonal drought however there is a lack of reports on the infiltration path and distribution pattern of rainwater in soil under vrt practice the present study used simulated rainfall and visualized the soil profile water distribution and path of vrt subsoiling tillage ss and conventional tillage ct practices twenty four hours after applying simulated rain vertical soil profiles were photographed and staining features used to indicate the infiltration path and distribution of rainwater in the soil our results showed that when rainwater infiltrated into the soil matrix and preferential flows occurred concomitantly under vrt practice and mainly matrix flow for ss and ct practices the vrt increased water infiltration into the soil occurrence of preferential flow and water storage in the soil profile while the soil of ss and ct somewhat hindered the infiltration of water the vrt decreased soil bulk density bd by 9 2 10 3 and increased soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k s by 50 4 70 4 compared with ss and ct moreover vrt significantly increased potato tuber yield by 22 9 36 0 compared with ss and ct in two consecutive years structural equation modeling sem further revealed that vrt increased potato yield was mainly caused by decreasing bd and increasing k s and then increasing water storage in the soil profile these findings suggest that decreased bd and increased k s in vrt practice could be particularly important for infiltration sustaining and supplying of soil water in rainfed areas worldwide which is important for production practices in these areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords vertical rotary subsoiling semi arid areas dye tracer preferential flow soil saturated hydraulic conductivity solanum tuberosum l data availability data

plastic film mulching rfpm is a promising method for coping with drought stress in semi arid areas wei et al 2022 yang et al 2022 k zhang et al 2022 l zhang et al 2022 because rfpm can effectively collect precipitation inhibit evaporation and increase soil moisture realize efficient use of natural precipitation in drylands li et al 2020 f zhang et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 f zhang et al 2017 p zhang et al 2017 p zhang et al 2020 many studies showed that rfpm has significantly increased the yield of potato solanum tuberosum l maize zea mays l wheat triticum aestivum l and other crops by more than 30 on average chai et al 2022 qin et al 2022 k zhang et al 2022 potato as a staple food is widely grown in semi arid areas and even worldwide thus the increase in potato production is crucial for future global food security qin et al 2022 raymundo et al 2018 however seasonal drought caused by the uneven distribution of natural precipitation still restrains potato tuber yield in plastic mulched fields wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2020c moreover soil compaction is another important negative factor affecting potato production due to farmland management e g in sowing or harvesting have required more frequent farming operations using heavy machines liu et al 2010 zhai et al 2017 many studies showed that tillage practices can influence crop yield via such soil properties as structure and water retention which are regarded as some of the most important agricultural management measures acharya and sharma 1994 guan et al 2014 lampurlanés et al 2001 zhai et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a 2020b due to soil properties especially bulk density bd and hydraulic conductivity significantly affected soil water supply capacity bohne and olszta 1992 zhang et al 2020a zhao et al 1997 previous studies have shown that vrt vertical rotary subsoiling combined the advantage of rotary tillage and sub soiling which can better decrease bd and increase pore distribution and has the potential to increase crop yield zhang et al 2020a 2020b zhang et al 2020a showed that compared with conventional tillage ct vrt significantly reduced bd and the soil wilting coefficient and improved swc potato yield and wue in semi arid areas other studies also showed that compared with no tillage vrt significantly increased maize yield and swc and decreased bd in semi arid and semi humid areas zhai et al 2017 in addition vrt can increase the stable soil aggregates soil porosity crop root biomass aboveground biomass and harvest index wang et al 2020 zhai et al 2017 therefore vrt is an effective way to resist seasonal drought stress and increase crop yield however current studies on vrt mainly focus on crop yield soil moisture and soil properties there are no reports on the infiltration path and distribution pattern of rainwater in soil under vrt practice previous studies have shown that the dye tracing method can directly observe the path and distribution of water flow in soil flury and wai 2003 ghodrati and jury 1990 the path and distribution of water flow in the soil were identified by image analysis of photographed dye profiles and further interpretation and calculations cey and rudolph 2009

and fresh tuber biomass was recorded some fresh tubers were taken back to the laboratory to be weighed and dried 75 c to obtain the dry weight to calculate the water content of potato tubers and then calculate the potato yield of each plot and finally converted into the yield per ha three plants were randomly selected from each plot leaving the below ground parts and then dried at 75 c until constant weight potato aboveground biomass per ha was calculated using planting density 2 7 statistical analysis one way anova was used to determine whether there were any significant differences

data and prepare the graphs 3 results 3 1 water flow behavior in soil twenty four hours after applying simulated rain we found that as rainfall increased so did the infiltration depth of rainwater into the soil fig 3 however the infiltration patterns of rainwater differed among the tillage practices this effect was less pronounced when daily rainfall was 5 mm but more pronounced when it was 25 or 50 mm when daily rainfall was 5 mm the stained distribution of the soil profile was similar for different tillage practices when daily rainfall was 25 or 50 mm the vrt treatment showed a soil profile dyed section distributed in a dendritic pattern while under ss and ct treatments there was a continuously distributed vertical profile dyed section fig 3 fig 4 presents the spatial distribution of stained percentage with soil depth when daily rainfall was 5 mm the indexes of dc sa id uid and pf fr did not differ among the tillage practices when daily rainfall was 25 mm under vrt treatment dc sa id uid and pf fr were 27 4 548 0 cm2 30 5 cm 4 4 cm and 60 0 respectively for ss and ct treatments these indexes were all lower than for vrt and similar between ss and ct treatments furthermore when daily rainfall was 50 mm dc sa id and pf fr of vrt were 47 2 824 6 cm2 37 6 cm and 65 2 respectively which were higher than those of ss and ct however the uid of the vrt 5 7 cm treatment was less than that of the ss 9 4 cm and ct 10 6 cm treatments 3 2 swc in dyed regions there was no difference p 0 05 in swc within 0 60 cm under different tillage practices fig 5a and b for precipitation of 5 mm when precipitation was 25 mm 0 10 cm swc was higher in ss and ct than in vrt treatment p 0 05 20 40 cm swc was higher in vrt than in ss and ct treatments p 0 05 and swc showed no significant differences p 0 05 among tillage practices for both 10 20 and 40 60 cm depths fig 5c when precipitation was 50 mm 0 10 cm swc was lower in vrt and ss than in ct treatment p 0 05 10 20 cm swc showed no significant differences p 0 05 among tillage practices and 20 40 and 40 60 cm swc was higher p 0 05 in vrt than in ss and ct treatments p 0 05 fig 5d 3 3 bd and k s in different tillage practices the vrt treatment significantly p 0 05 decreased bd at 0 10 and 10 20 cm soil depth compared to ss and ct but with no significant p 0 05 differences between ss and ct fig 6a at 20 40 cm soil depth the vrt significantly p 0 05 decreased bd compared to ct but with no differences p 0 05 between ss and ct fig 6a at 40 60 cm soil depth bd did not significantly differ p 0 05 among vrt ss and ct treatments at 0 60 cm soil depth vrt reduced bd by 10 3 and 9 2 compared with ct and ss respectively fig 6a the vrt treatment significantly p 0 05 increased k s at 0 10 10 20 and 20 40 cm soil depth compared to ss and ct but with no significant p 0 05 differences between ss and ct fig 6b at 40 60 cm soil depth k s did not significantly differ p 0 05 among vrt ss and ct treatments fig 6b at 0 60 cm soil depth vrt increased k s by 70 4 and 50 4 compared with ct and ss respectively fig 6b 3 4 potato tuber yield in different tillage practices in the two consecutive years vrt significantly increased tuber yield table 2 by 22 9 and 36 0 in 2020 compared with ss and ct respectively and by 27 2 and 35 5 in 2021 compared with ct tuber yield was non significantly higher for ss in 2020 and 2021 compared with ct and ss vrt significantly increased aboveground biomass by 31 5 and 21 1 in 2020 and 29 9 and 24 9 in 2021 respectively table 2 3 5 relationship between potato tuber yield and soil properties potato tuber yield was positively correlated with k s and swc 20 40 cm but negatively correlated with bd fig 7 furthermore dc sa id pf fr and k s were negatively correlated with bd based on spearman s correlation results fig 7 we used sem analysis to explore the impact of k s bd and swc on potato tuber yield fig 8 the sem analysis showed that vrt k s bd and swc jointly explained 67 of the variation in potato tuber yield in detail the vrt mainly had a direct positive effect on k s standard path coefficients spc 0 90 and the vrt had a direct negative effect on bd spc 0 82 the swc mainly had a direct positive effect on potato tuber yield spc 0 82 vrt k s and bd had indirect effect on potato tuber yield therefore vrt significantly increased k s and decreased bd leading to increased swc and significantly increased potato tuber yield compared with ct and ss treatments p 0 001 4 discussion some studies have shown that dye tracer simulation of rainfall can be used to visualize the water distribution and path in the soil profile jiang and li 2015 zhu et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 and van schaik 2009 showed that calculated preferential flow parameters e g id dc uid sa and pf fr based on dye images could assess the extent of preferential flow in the present study when daily rainfall was low 5 mm the stained distribution of the soil profile under different tillage practices was similar for all treatments dc sa id uid and pf fr showed little differences however when the daily rainfall was high 25 or 50 mm under the vrt treatment the dyed soil was distributed in a dendritic pattern while under ss and ct treatments the dyed section was continuously distributed dc sa id and pf fr of vrt were higher than those of ss and ct these results indicate that under vrt treatment when rainfall intensity was low the preferential flow undeveloped and when the rainfall intensity was high the preferential flow developed which is similar to the results of some previous studies guo 2008 wu et al 2009 because the factors affecting preferential flow include rainfall intensity tillage methods soil water content etc jarvis et al 2016 jarvis 2007 vidon and cuadra 2010 yao et al 2017 vrt significantly reduced bd increased k s and increased soil porosity thus promoting the occurrence of preferential flow in addition we also found that when rainwater infiltrated into the soil matrix and preferential flow occurred concomitantly under vrt practice with matrix flow mainly for ss and ct due to the presence of preferential flow could not disaffiliate itself from the occurrence of soil matrix flow jiang et al 2017 the dye tracer imaging approach has been prevailingly applied to observe and assess the soil preferential flow in farmland forest and so on for example chen et al 2022 applied different irrigation quotas and the dye tracing image method to investigate the characteristics of the preferential flow in cotton fields bargues tobella et al 2014 used rainfall simulations and tracer experiments to investigate the effect of trees and associated termite mounds on soil infiltrability and preferential flow therefore this study showed that vrt can promote the formation of preferential flow water infiltration into soil and water movement in dryland farmland ecosystems some previous studies showed that soil moisture and bd were significantly influenced by various tillage practices which played the most important role in soil crop systems jabro et al 2015 qin et al 2008 zhai et al 2017 in the present study after 24 h of simulated precipitation swc was similar under different tillage practices when daily rainfall was low 5 mm when the daily rainfall was high 25 or 50 mm the 0 10 cm swc of the vrt treatment was significantly lower than that of ss and ct when daily rainfall was 50 mm the 0 10 cm swc of ss and ct exceeded the maximum field water capacity but the 20 40 cm swc of vrt was significantly higher than that of ss and ct thus vrt treated soil acted like a sponge increasing water infiltration into the soil and water storage in the soil profile while the soil of ss and ct resisted the infiltration of water fig 5 this result was in agreement with the result of zhai et al 2017 who showed that vrt significantly increased swc in the 20 60 cm soil layer some studies have shown that the amount of water infiltration in the vertical profile directly reflects soil infiltrability in each layer and provides evidence for preferential flow mei et al 2018 furthermore the vrt significantly reduced bd in the 0 40 cm soil layer this result was in agreement with the result of mu et al 2016 who found that deep tillage to 30 cm significantly reduced bd in the 10 30 cm soil layer our study showed that vrt could effectively improve swc and increase the occurrence of preferential flow mainly due to the increase of k s and the reduction of bd with vrt which were continuous and conducive to the rapid movement of water zhang et al 2011 zheng et al 2004 some studies have shown that k s is a key soil hydraulic parameter with a crucial role in modeling water movement processes through the soil profile jačka et al 2014 reynolds et al 2000 a high k s can enhance rainfall infiltration and reduce surface erosion zhu et al 2019 especially in rainfed areas this could be particularly important for infiltration sustaining and supplying of soil water moreover the vrt increased potato tuber yield and aboveground biomass table 2 which is consistent with previous studies yin et al 2022 zhang et al 2020a 2020b this was mainly due to vrt effectively improved soil water conditions and increased water use efficiency yin et al 2022 zhang et al 2020a and thus enhanced potato the drought resistance during the dry season and drought years 5 conclusions the present study vividly illustrated the rainwater infiltration path and distribution in soil under vrt ss and ct practices twenty four hours after applying simulated rain vertical soil profiles were photographed and staining features were used to indicate the infiltration path and distribution of rainwater when rainwater infiltrated into the soil matrix and preferential flows occurred concomitantly for vrt with main matrix flow for ss and ct the vrt increased water infiltration into the soil increased the occurrence of preferential flow and increased water storage in the soil profile while the soil of ss and ct showed some resistance to water infiltration moreover vrt significantly increased potato tuber yield sem further revealed that vrt increased potato yield was mainly caused by decreasing bd and increasing k s and then increasing water storage in the soil profile these findings suggest that vrt practice could be particularly important for infiltration sustaining and supplying of soil water and agricultural production practices facing seasonal drought stress in rainfed areas worldwide the results are of great significance

9293,the objective of reservoir water allocation based on considering the ecological water demand of the downstream river has an important impact on the water allocation of each water user and the downstream ecology agricultural irrigation with large water consumption will directly affect crop yield irrigation water as the recharge of groundwater in irrigation districts also plays an important role in the restoration of groundwater this research used the range of variability approach rva a method of flow management considering the water demand of river ecosystems to provide the recommended outflow range rva target of the huangbizhuang reservoir upstream of the shijin irrigation district first we used the rva target to determine the water allocation of each water user set 27 irrigation schemes with the water allocation of agriculture as a constraint and used the validated aquacrop model seven years of field experiment data were used to calibrate aquacrop model parameters to evaluate the most appropriate irrigation schemes and their impact on groundwater restoration in the irrigation district the results showed that the amount of water available for agricultural irrigation in the flood season under the rva target was 84 mm which was 36 mm less than the current irrigation quota 120 mm three irrigation schemes better than the current scheme scheme 0 were selected i e scheme 1 irrigate 42 mm at the seedling and jointing stages scheme 16 irrigate 42 mm at the seedling stage and scheme 22 irrigate 84 mm at the seedling stage scheme 22 increased the yield of corn and wp water productivity which were 17 kg ha and 1 kg ha mm higher than scheme 0 respectively which provided the greatest increase in yield scheme 22 can restore 0 727 m of the groundwater table the yield increased in scheme 16 was 4 kg ha higher than that in scheme 0 scheme 16 can restore 0 982 m of the groundwater table which was the most conducive scheme for groundwater recharge the wp of scheme 16 and scheme 1 was slightly different from that of scheme 0 there was a slight difference in biomass among the four schemes the yield increased in scheme 1 was 12 kg ha higher than that in scheme 0 which could restore 0 727 m of the groundwater table simultaneously which was for a normal year this research can provide a reference for the formulation of a local irrigation scheme to stabilize and increase summer maize yield on the premise of satisfying the ecological water demand of the river and restoring the groundwater table keywords flow management irrigation scheme summer maize aquacrop groundwater table shijin irrigation district data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the flow regime is a driving force in river ecosystems poff et al 1997 flow controls velocity water depth and habitat volume which are the key habitat parameters flow is also tightly coupled to other environmental conditions such as oxygen and temperature substrate particle size and channel morphology changes in the natural flow regime alter the distribution and availability of fluvial habitat conditions adversely affecting native biota richter et al 1996 poff et al 1997 2010 the construction of the reservoir has changed the natural flow regime blocked the longitudinal connectivity of the river and induced ecological problems such as the reduction of biodiversity the deterioration of water quality and the long term cut off of the downstream river to solve these ecological problems the reservoir must adopt a new operation mode to meet the water demand of the river ecosystem this will inevitably lead to changes in the configuration of regional water supply sources including surface water groundwater desalination and process industries panagopoulos 2022 panagopoulos and haralambous a 2020 panagopoulos and haralambous b 2020 the shijin irrigation district is a large irrigation district in the north china plain agriculture accounts for approximately 60 of the total water consumption in the north china plain the diversion surface water of the irrigation comes from the huangbizhuang reservoir upstream however many farmlands are irrigated entirely by groundwater over extraction of groundwater for irrigation has caused groundwater table drops of 20 40 m in the past 30 years threatening the sustainable development of irrigated agriculture the reservoir blocks the longitudinal connectivity of the river however the decline in groundwater level makes it impossible for groundwater to recharge the river which leads to the long term cut off of some rivers downstream of the shijin irrigation district this requires a change in the source of irrigation water it is urgent to replace groundwater with surface water considering the ecological water demand of rivers what comprehensive impact will it have on agricultural water use and groundwater in irrigation districts especially for groundwater overexploitation areas it is necessary to research it there are a number of methods for establishing ecological flow targets such as the ecological limits of hydrologic alteration eloha poff et al 2010 and instream flow incremental methodology ifim the core is the physical habitat simulation model phabsim which place high demands on ecological data however ecological data are often lacking in practice richter et al 1996 proposed a method of flow surface water management named rva which contains 33 parameters of five hydrological components magnitude timing duration frequency and rate of change the rva target range for flow is usually based on a selected percentile level or a simple multiple of the standard deviation of the parameters of the natural or predevelopment flow regime the management goal is not to have the river reach its target range every year but rather to reach the target range at the same frequency as the natural or predevelopment flow regime generally the rva target range is defined by the 25th and 75th percentile values of each parameter by analysing the rva results it is possible to identify areas in which changes in flow regime are disrupting or may disrupt the connectivity of the entire system therefore the use of this tool is essential for the conservation of river biodiversity rva has been used in many studies ashraf et al 2016 alrajoula et al 2016 gierszewski et al 2019 kumar and jayakumar 2020 yu et al 2020 cui et al 2020 water allocation under the rva target affects the available water supply of the irrigation district which may affect grain yield it is essential to develop the most suitable irrigation scheme to produce optimum crop yields under limited water supplies long term field experiment data are usually limited due to the long period and high cost therefore based on weather soil and crop parameters building crop models is often used to evaluate the impact of different climate scenarios and field management measures on crop production and water use the aquacrop model developed by fao was used in this research and has been widely used in the optimization of irrigation schemes for maize wheat cotton tomato potato and other crops andarzian et al 2011 linker et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 regarding the formulation of the irrigation schemes previous research did not comprehensively consider the ecological water demand of the downstream river and the restoration of groundwater this research considered the ecological needs of the above two aspects and linked irrigation optimization schemes to rva targets on the premise of considering the ecological health of the river the effect of the outflow of huangbizhuang reservoir under the rva target on agricultural water use and crop production in the shijin irrigation district was researched the main research contents are as follows 1 use rva to provide the recommended outflow range rva target of huangbizhuang reservoir 2 quantify the effect of reservoir outflow on agricultural water use in the flood season under the rva target and 3 use seven years of field experiment data to calibrate aquacrop model parameters and quantify the effect of reservoir outflow on summer maize production under the rva target then the aquacrop model was used to evaluate the production and water use of summer maize under 27 irrigation schemes and the most appropriate irrigation schemes were screened 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the shijin irrigation district with an area of 5191 km2 is located in the haihe river basin north china plain the flood season is from june to september the effective irrigation area is 933 km2 the main crops include wheat 81 corn 81 cotton 16 other cash crops 1 0 and other grain crops 2 0 and the multiple crop index was 1 81 agricultural water use in this area comes from precipitation surface water and underground water surface water is provided jointly by the gangnan reservoir and huangbizhuang reservoir the two reservoirs supply the domestic industrial and urban environment water to shijiazhuang the capital of hebei province in addition to the shijin irrigation district and the lingzheng and jisan irrigation districts the huangbizhuang reservoir supplies water first and when water is insufficient the gangnan reservoir supplies water to users through the huangbizhuang reservoir the location of the shijin irrigation district and reservoirs is shown in fig 1 2 2 sequential clustering method to determine the rva target calculation period we used the sequential clustering method to test the mutation point of the outflow of huangbizhuang reservoir from 1995 to 2021 the sequential clustering method does not disturb the order in classification and the essence of predicting the mutation point was to seek the optimal segmentation point to minimize the sum of squares of deviation between the same classes and maximize the sum of squares of deviation between different classes suppose hydrological series is x 1 x 2 x n the possible mutation point is τ 2 τ n 1 and the sum of squares of deviation before and after the mutation point is 1 v τ i 1 τ x i x τ 2 2 v n τ i τ 1 n x i x n τ 2 where x τ 1 τ i 1 τ x i x n τ 1 n τ i τ 1 n x i 3 s n τ v τ v n τ if τ makes s min 2 τ n 1 s n τ then τ is the optimal segmentation point 2 3 rva target the rva target range for flow is usually based on a selected percentile level of the natural or predevelopment flow regime the rva target was calculated for the outflow of huangbizhuang reservoir began flood control in 1959 built into the current scale in 1968 during the flood season june to september from 1968 to 2021 to make the data series consistent the data from 1968 to 2021 were selected in this study according to the mutation point we divided the outflow time series into two periods the outflow before the mutation was regarded as the predevelopment flow and that after the mutation was regarded as the after development flow tian et al 2019 and gierszewski et al 2019 applied the same treatment to the division of the time series predevelopment and after development the predevelopment flow was not used because of the lack of measured data and on the other hand the dam has flood control irrigation power generation and other functions it was impossible to operate according to the natural flow regime the reservoir attempts to store water during the flood season and release water to generate hydroelectricity and supply water during the dry season therefore using data after development was more realistic the degree to which the rva target range was not attained is a measure of hydrologic alteration expected was used to describe the count of years for which the monthly average value was expected to fall within the targeted range in the predevelopment flow regime in the before mutation flow regime for this study observed was used to describe the count of years in which the observed monthly average value of the hydrologic parameter fell within the targeted range in the after development flow regime in the after mutation flow regime for this study this measure of hydrologic alteration expressed as a percentage can be calculated by richter et al 1998 4 observed expected expected 100 hydrological alteration values of 0 33 represent relatively unaltered 34 67 represent moderately altered 68 100 represent highly altered positive deviation indicates that values fell within the rva target more than expected negative deviation indicates that values fell within the rva target less than expected 2 4 field experiment field experiments were carried out from june 2004 to september 2010 encompassing seven summer maize growing seasons at the luancheng agroecological experimental station 37 89 n 114 69 e in shijiazhuang hebei province china luancheng station is an important grain producing area in china and a typical agricultural area in the mountain foot in the north china plain which has the ecological characteristics of intensive high yield resource constrained and well irrigation in 1999 it became a member of the global terrestrial observation system gtos the precipitation during the maize season june september was approximately 250 350 mm the sampling area is 5400 m2 which was established in 2004 the soil is loam the main physical characteristics of the soil are listed in table 1 sun et al 2015 the organic matter total nitrogen n rapidly available phosphorous p and rapidly available potassium k in the upper 0 2 m of soil were 23 85 g kg 1 5 g kg 37 3 mg kg and 112 04 mg kg respectively the maize variety was xianyu 335 which was sown in mid june and harvested in late september the current irrigation scheme is to irrigate 60 mm at the seedling stage and big trumpet stage the water source is underground well water all the fertilizers were applied in the big trumpet stage 269 3 kg ha n 10 1 kg ha p2o5 and 183 2 kg ha k2o the soil characteristics and nutrient level of the sampling site were representative in the shijin irrigation district and tillage fertilization and irrigation schemes represented the agricultural management measures commonly adopted by farmers in this area the above experimental data are derived from the soil science database http vdb3 soil csdb cn the parameters of the aquacrop model are calibrated with yield data 2 5 aquacrop model construction and evaluation the aquacrop model is a crop water productivity model developed by the world food and agriculture organization fao to address food security and assess environmental and management impacts on crop production the calculation theory has three core formulas 5 y y a y k y e t e t a e t 6 y b h i 7 b w p t r where y and y a are the potential and actual yields respectively kg m2 e t and e t a are the potential evapotranspiration and

luancheng experimental site were used for model construction and calibration as part of the meteorological data of luancheng station was missing it was replaced with that of nearby shijiazhuang station 38 02 n 114 42 e daily meteorological data are obtained from http cdc cma gov cn home do the groundwater table was set to 32 09 m below the soil surface the management was fixed to moderate soil fertility stress 10 cm height of soil bunds and 1 relative cover of weeds the initial soil water content was 75 of the field capacity the relative error re normalized root mean square error nrmse and residual accumulation coefficient crm were used to evaluate the precision of the aquacrop model the calculation formula is as follows 8 re m i s i s i 100 9 n r m s e i 1 i n s i m i 2 n s e 10 c

was considered that the model had good simulation performance the smaller the nrmse was the smaller the deviation between the simulated value and the measured value when crm 0 the simulation valuewas low and when crm 0 the simulation value was high 2 6 design and evaluation of irrigation schemes the growth periods of maize were divided into 11 periods and irrigation was carried out in the main growth periods bold in table 2 we set the irrigation times to once or twice among them scheme 0 was the current irrigation scheme 1 15 were the schemes for irrigation twice permutation and combination of growth periods each irrigation was half of the total irrigation volume 16 21 were the schemes for irrigation once each irrigation is half of the total irrigation volume 22 27 were the schemes for irrigation once each irrigation is the total irrigation volume the concepts of yield biomass crop water productivity wp soil water content and restoration of the groundwater table were used to evaluate the studied irrigation schemes 11 wp y et where wp is crop water productivity kg ha mm y is crop yield kg ha and et is the crop evapotranspiration mm the groundwater recharge from irrigation can be calculated by the following formula based on the data and reports from the luancheng water conservation office mao et al 2005 12 i r 0 12 i where i r is the groundwater recharge from irrigation mm and i is the depth of irrigation water mm the change in the groundwater table can be calculated by the groundwater balance equation mao et al 2005 sun et al 2015 13 d q μ a where d is the change in the groundwater table m q is the change in water amount which is defined as the difference between the drainage from the root zone profile and the irrigation water drawn m3 a is the calculated area m2 and μ is the specific yield which is 0 165 at the luancheng experimental site mao et al 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of the mutation point we calculated the monthly average outflow of huangbizhuang reservoir from 1968 to 2021 as seen from fig 2 the sequential clustering method was used to test the mutation point which was 1996 there was a catastrophic flood in 1996 precipitation for 2020 is missing the huangbizhuang reservoir is located in the centre of the rainstorm and the downstream outflow is the maximum since the construction of the reservoir before and after 1996 the variation trend of precipitation was relatively consistent the outflow before the mutation point had higher amplitudes compared to the postflood intervals because the huangbizhuang reservoir was reinforced from 1998 to 2003 the regulating storage capacity has been increased which can store more water to ensure the water demand of downstream water users 3 2 recommended reservoir outflow as shown in fig 3 and table 3 attainment of an rva target range defined by the 25th lower limit and 75th upper limit percentile values of reservoir outflow before the mutation 1968 1995 would be expected in only 50 of years richter et al 1998 therefore the reservoir outflow in the remaining 50 of years that does not meet the ecological water demand needs to be adjusted according to the rva target according to the recommended outflow in table 3 the total available water was 367 million m3 as the shijin irrigation district belongs to the groundwater overexploitation area groundwater was not considered in the calculation of total available water one third of the average annual domestic 40 million m3 industrial 20 million m3 and urban environment 4 million m3 water diversion as well as the lingzheng 55 million m3 and jisan 19 million m3 irrigation water were deducted the effective irrigation area of corn was 756 km2 the water loss rate was 29 7 from huangbizhuang reservoir to the shijin irrigation district gu et al 2017 according to the water balance the amount of water available for agricultural irrigation in the flood season is 63 million m3 84 mm under the rva target more discharge in june was due to the gradual release of water before the flood season to vacate storage capacity the outflow decreased in august and september because the irrigation water consumption was reduced for summer maize in addition the reservoir began to store water of course under special circumstances it shall be flexibly adjusted according to the inflow and the precipitation of the day the outflow in most years was within the rva target range after the mutation from fig 3 the variation degrees of june july august and september are 14 29 relatively unaltered 21 43 relatively unaltered 7 14 relatively unaltered and 35 71 moderately altered respectively calculated by formula 4 only in september was the variation degree of outflow slightly larger which needs to be the focus of regulation the above results indicated that the downstream water demand can be satisfied by regulating the outflow of huangbizhuang reservoir according to the rva target 3 3 calibration and validation of the aquacrop model the main parameters after calibration are shown in table 4 according to the simulation results in table 5 the model has high precision the aquacrop model had some errors 1 data errors including soil data weather data and survey data 2 errors caused by field management parameters that vary from region to region and 3 errors of the model itself such as the model cannot reflect the impact of pests and diseases 3 4 optimized irrigation scheme under the rva target 3 4 1 yield biomass and wp of different irrigation schemes irrigation amount and timing significantly affected maize yield as shown in fig 4 taking yield as the screening index three irrigation schemes better than the current scheme scheme 0 were selected and counted as shown in table 6 compared with scheme 0 the magnitude of the increase in yield is as follows scheme 22 scheme 1 scheme 16 scheme 22 increased the yield of crop and wp that were 17 kg ha and 1 kg ha mm higher than scheme 0 respectively the yield increased in scheme 1 and scheme 16 were 12 kg ha and 4 kg ha higher than that in scheme 0 respectively the wp of scheme 16 and scheme 1 was slightly different from that of scheme 0 combined with fig 5 overall there was a slight difference in biomass among the four schemes and the yield of the optimized irrigation schemes did not increase much however the agricultural land area in the north china plain is 17 98 million ha which is very large additionally our research proves that the current irrigation scheme is feasible and that there is room for further optimization therefore scheme 22 is recommended for summer maize production in years with more precipitation or upstream inflow in the main growth periods as an adequate irrigation method in terms of both yield and wp scheme 1 is for a normal year as shown in fig 4 the precipitation during the flood season from 2005 to 2007 was low but the yield was not the lowest we also showed the precipitation during the main growth periods it was found that the lower precipitation in the flood season from 2005 to 2007 did not affect the yield because the precipitation in the main growth periods was guaranteed it can be concluded that in the main growth periods of maize adequate precipitation and irrigation are the keys to ensuring stable yields in years with little precipitation or upstream inflow in the main growth periods scheme 16 as a limited irrigation or deficit irrigation method should be implemented the remaining water can be distributed to other industries higher grain yield and wp could be obtained by moderately regulating soil water depletion at the early stage of vegetative growth limited irrigation has been promoted in recent years some studies show that limited irrigation does not reduce yield but increases it zhang et al 2013 sun et al 2015 xu et al 2016 wang et al 2017 zou et al 2021 the results showed that ensuring water supply and meeting water demand at the seedling stage was the key to increasing yield there was less precipitation during this period and additional water was applied to ensure the growth of a whole seedling the jointing stage scheme 1 is the key period for vegetative growth and canopy development and water deficit has a great influence on yield from the large trumpet stage to the laddering period vegetative organs such as leaf enlargement and stem node elongation grow vigorously and reproductive organs such as male and female panicles differentiate and form lack of water can lead to malnourished and weak plants that are difficult to pollinate leading to severe production cuts there is more rainwater at the small trumpet stage and after anthesis so irrigation is not necessary deep soil water is the main water source for maize in the late growth period plants under limited irrigation used not only surface soil water but also deep soil water and thus had higher soil storage after harvest xu et al 2016 3 4 2 effects of soil water content on yield and wp the yield and wp are related to water consumption the average simulation results of the soil water content by the aquacrop model from 2004 to 2010 along the soil profiles of the three optimized schemes and the current irrigation scheme are shown in fig 6 there was no difference in the water content of topsoil 0 0 2 m under the different irrigation schemes while the different irrigation schemes had significant effects on the deep soil water content when the soil depth was 0 3 m the difference in water content at the same soil layer under different schemes gradually became obvious with a maximum difference of 7 when the soil depth was 0 5 m the water content of the four schemes was scheme 22 scheme 0 scheme 1 scheme 16 sufficient irrigation scheme 22 significantly increased the soil water content relative to limited irrigation scheme 16 scheme 16 had the lowest amount of irrigation water so the soil water content was the lowest but the yield did not decrease indicating that limited irrigation would increase crop yield zou et al 2021 and wp the use of soil water by crops is affected by soil water availability and the crop root system soil water use is related to root length and root length density distribution ninety five percent of the roots were concentrated in the 0 40 cm soil layer 0 40 cm is the main area of root water absorption so even the limited irrigation scheme 16 can basically guarantee the grain yield from the perspective of root water absorption potential scheme 0 scheme 22 scheme 1 scheme 16 before jointing the root length is shorter and undeveloped and maize mainly uses shallow soil water scheme 0 is more beneficial to plant growth at the jointing stage maize can form a strong root system secondary roots can be buried to a depth of approximately 2 m after jointing maize also uses deep soil water especially when water is scarce scheme 22 was more beneficial to plant growth the distribution of root length density is usually incorporated into the study of water and nitrate uptake as well as grain yield production wu et al 1999 zhang et al 2013 root length density peaks at anthesis and then declines over time barraclough and leigh 1984 as shown in table 2 there was more rainwater at the small trumpet stage and after anthesis but less rainwater from the seedling stage to the jointing stage and from the large trumpet stage to anthesis in general a slight water shortage during vegetative growth can increase vertical root penetration resulting in lower root length density in the upper soil and higher root length density in the deeper soil zhang et al 2004 li et al 2010 which helps to absorb more soil water for the big trumpet stage tasseling stage and anthesis in this region before jointing maize mainly carries on the root leaf growth and stem node differentiation and the root system is underdeveloped it is also appropriate for limited irrigation from the seedling stage to the jointing stage during these growing periods maize has a shorter root and does not need additional water absorbing shallow soil water from rainwater to meet growth needs the results of previous studies at the same site showed that when the root length density was less than 0 8 cm cm3 the root length density was a limiting factor for crops to make full use of soil water zhang et al 2004 the better root growth is the more water is extracted from deep soil which is significantly correlated with grain yield under limited water supply conditions improving soil water use by developing crop roots will make a significant contribution to yield scheme 22 is recommended for summer maize production in years with more precipitation however applying such an amount as 84 mm at once the seedling stage is very risky in a loamy texture we were lucky the soil texture changes from loamy surface 0 85 cm to silty clay loam at 85 165 cm and clay loam at 120 165 cm where the saturated hydraulic conductivity decreases from an average value of 745 3 mm we must relate the results to the soil texture preserving the moisture and reducing the leaching towards the groundwater this method of irrigation cannot be recommended everywhere unless we can secure even rainfall as it is related to specific soil conditions it resembles the split irrigation used in yemen on clay soils where precipitation water is converted down the slopes through canals to each farmer s plots using flood irrigation and then water is converted to the lower plots the more efficient use of water in scheme 16 where 42 mm was applied once at the seedling stage can support this conclusion 3 4 3 effects of optimized irrigation schemes on restoration of the groundwater table the groundwater recharge from irrigation was calculated by formula 12 which is 10 08 mm 10 08 mm and 5 04 mm for scheme 22 scheme 1 and scheme 16 respectively the groundwater table from irrigation will be restored to 0 062 m 0 062 m and 0 031 m for scheme 22 scheme 1 and scheme 16 respectively calculated by formula 13 additionally for the three optimized schemes replacing groundwater with surface water will reduce the extraction of groundwater by 120 mm compared with the current irrigation scheme scheme 0 formula 13 was used to convert this part of the groundwater to the water table there was no drainage and the calculated result was 0 727 m in comparison with scheme 22 and scheme 1 scheme 16 can save 42 mm for restoring 0 255 m of the groundwater table in conclusion under the rva target replacing groundwater with surface water can restore at least 0 727 m of the groundwater table which was beneficial to the ecological environment and the sustainable utilization of water resources scheme 22 and scheme 1 can restore the groundwater table by 0 789 m scheme 16 can restore 1 013 m of the groundwater table which was the most conducive scheme for groundwater recharge the observed average annual decline in the groundwater table in the past three decades was 1 04 m a at luancheng station sun et al 2015 in this research the replacement of irrigation water from groundwater with surface water was more important therefore reducing the exploitation of groundwater for agricultural irrigation is an effective way to protect groundwater in this area et is the main factor affecting the change in the groundwater table and reducing ineffective et is an effective measure to alleviate the decline in the groundwater table yang et al 2015 strengthening soil nutrient management wang et al 2006 enhancing the breeding of drought tolerant varieties passioura et al 2006 and strengthening soil surface management hou et al 2012 are effective measures to reduce ineffective et yang et al 2006 reported that reducing the average annual et by 76 mm equivalent to reducing irrigation by 100 mm can alleviate the decline in the groundwater table by 0 42 m year while reducing the yield of winter wheat by only 5 additionally diversified crop rotations can also mitigate the decline in the groundwater table yang et al 2015 of course the studies mentioned above are based on the use of groundwater for irrigation if less or no groundwater is used the groundwater table will rise further in future research we will focus on the impact of adjusting the planting structure of crops and increasing field management measures such as mulching film on groundwater recovery some schemes can be selected to further accelerate groundwater recovery 4 conclusions the amount of water available for agricultural irrigation in the flood season was 63 million m3 84 mm under the rva target more important was the replacement of irrigation water from groundwater with surface water there are three optimal irrigation schemes for reference scheme 22 is recommended for summer maize production in years with more precipitation or upstream inflow in the main growth periods as an adequate irrigation method in years with little precipitation or upstream inflow in the main growth periods scheme 16 as a limited irrigation or deficit irrigation method should be implemented scheme 1 is recommended for a normal year under the rva target replacing groundwater with surface water can restore at least 0 727 m of the groundwater table scheme 22 and scheme 1 can restore the groundwater table by 0 789 m scheme 16 can restore 1 013 m of the groundwater table which is the most conducive scheme for groundwater recharge we provide a research idea and method but the research results may not be applicable to all regions other regions with similar different climates could refer to our research ideas but the formulation of specific irrigation schemes should integrate local climate water availability soil texture and other factors in the future the main rivers upstream of the shijin irrigation district will be selected as ecological monitoring points to monitor the species and abundance of fish zooplankton phytoplankton algae and benthic organisms the ecological limits of hydrologic alteration eloha poff et al 2010 are used to establish an ecological flow target which is comprehensive and targeted in addition the field experiment will be carried out in the shijin irrigation district in the future to compare the yield of the three optimized and current irrigation schemes and then determine the optimal irrigation

9293,the objective of reservoir water allocation based on considering the ecological water demand of the downstream river has an important impact on the water allocation of each water user and the downstream ecology agricultural irrigation with large water consumption will directly affect crop yield irrigation water as the recharge of groundwater in irrigation districts also plays an important role in the restoration of groundwater this research used the range of variability approach rva a method of flow management considering the water demand of river ecosystems to provide the recommended outflow range rva target of the huangbizhuang reservoir upstream of the shijin irrigation district first we used the rva target to determine the water allocation of each water user set 27 irrigation schemes with the water allocation of agriculture as a constraint and used the validated aquacrop model seven years of field experiment data were used to calibrate aquacrop model parameters to evaluate the most appropriate irrigation schemes and their impact on groundwater restoration in the irrigation district the results showed that the amount of water available for agricultural irrigation in the flood season under the rva target was 84 mm which was 36 mm less than the current irrigation quota 120 mm three irrigation schemes better than the current scheme scheme 0 were selected i e scheme 1 irrigate 42 mm at the seedling and jointing stages scheme 16 irrigate 42 mm at the seedling stage and scheme 22 irrigate 84 mm at the seedling stage scheme 22 increased the yield of corn and wp water productivity which were 17 kg ha and 1 kg ha mm higher than scheme 0 respectively which provided the greatest increase in yield scheme 22 can restore 0 727 m of the groundwater table the yield increased in scheme 16 was 4 kg ha higher than that in scheme 0 scheme 16 can restore 0 982 m of the groundwater table which was the most conducive scheme for groundwater recharge the wp of scheme 16 and scheme 1 was slightly different from that of scheme 0 there was a slight difference in biomass among the four schemes the yield increased in scheme 1 was 12 kg ha higher than that in scheme 0 which could restore 0 727 m of the groundwater table simultaneously which was for a normal year this research can provide a reference for the formulation of a local irrigation scheme to stabilize and increase summer maize yield on the premise of satisfying the ecological water demand of the river and restoring the groundwater table keywords flow management irrigation scheme summer maize aquacrop groundwater table shijin irrigation district data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the flow regime is a driving force in river ecosystems poff et al 1997 flow controls velocity water depth and habitat volume which are the key habitat parameters flow is also tightly coupled to other environmental conditions such as oxygen and temperature substrate particle size and channel morphology changes in the natural flow regime alter the distribution and availability of fluvial habitat conditions adversely affecting native biota richter et al 1996 poff et al 1997 2010 the construction of the reservoir has changed the natural flow regime blocked the longitudinal connectivity of the river and induced ecological problems such as the reduction of biodiversity the deterioration of water quality and the long term cut off of the downstream river to solve these ecological problems the reservoir must adopt a new operation mode to meet the water demand of the river ecosystem this will inevitably lead to changes in the configuration of regional water supply sources including surface water groundwater desalination and process industries panagopoulos 2022 panagopoulos and haralambous a 2020 panagopoulos and haralambous b 2020 the shijin irrigation district is a large irrigation district in the north china plain agriculture accounts for approximately 60 of the total water consumption in the north china plain the diversion surface water of the irrigation comes from the huangbizhuang reservoir upstream however many farmlands are irrigated entirely by groundwater over extraction of groundwater for irrigation has caused groundwater table drops of 20 40 m in the past 30 years threatening the sustainable development of irrigated agriculture the reservoir blocks the longitudinal connectivity of the river however the decline in groundwater level makes it impossible for groundwater to recharge the river which leads to the long term cut off of some rivers downstream of the shijin irrigation district this requires a change in the source of irrigation water it is urgent to replace groundwater with surface water considering the ecological water demand of rivers what comprehensive impact will it have on agricultural water use and groundwater in irrigation districts especially for groundwater overexploitation areas it is necessary to research it there are a number of methods for establishing ecological flow targets such as the ecological limits of hydrologic alteration eloha poff et al 2010 and instream flow incremental methodology ifim the core is the physical habitat simulation model phabsim which place high demands on ecological data however ecological data are often lacking in practice richter et al 1996 proposed a method of flow surface water management named rva which contains 33 parameters of five hydrological components magnitude timing duration frequency and rate of change the rva target range for flow is usually based on a selected percentile level or a simple multiple of the standard deviation of the parameters of the natural or predevelopment flow regime the management goal is not to have the river reach its target range every year but rather to reach the target range at the same frequency as the natural or predevelopment flow regime generally the rva target range is defined by the 25th and 75th percentile values of each parameter by analysing the rva results it is possible to identify areas in which changes in flow regime are disrupting or may disrupt the connectivity of the entire system therefore the use of this tool is essential for the conservation of river biodiversity rva has been used in many studies ashraf et al 2016 alrajoula et al 2016 gierszewski et al 2019 kumar and jayakumar 2020 yu et al 2020 cui et al 2020 water allocation under the rva target affects the available water supply of the irrigation district which may affect grain yield it is essential to develop the most suitable irrigation scheme to produce optimum crop yields under limited water supplies long term field experiment data are usually limited due to the long period and high cost therefore based on weather soil and crop parameters building crop models is often used to evaluate the impact of different climate scenarios and field management measures on crop production and water use the aquacrop model developed by fao was used in this research and has been widely used in the optimization of irrigation schemes for maize wheat cotton tomato potato and other crops andarzian et al 2011 linker et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 regarding the formulation of the irrigation schemes previous research did not comprehensively consider the ecological water demand of the downstream river and the restoration of groundwater this research considered the ecological needs of the above two aspects and linked irrigation optimization schemes to rva targets on the premise of considering the ecological health of the river the effect of the outflow of huangbizhuang reservoir under the rva target on agricultural water use and crop production in the shijin irrigation district was researched the main research contents are as follows 1 use rva to provide the recommended outflow range rva target of huangbizhuang reservoir 2 quantify the effect of reservoir outflow on agricultural water use in the flood season under the rva target and 3 use seven years of field experiment data to calibrate aquacrop model parameters and quantify the effect of reservoir outflow on summer maize production under the rva target then the aquacrop model was used to evaluate the production and water use of summer maize under 27 irrigation schemes and the most appropriate irrigation schemes were screened 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the shijin irrigation district with an area of 5191 km2 is located in the haihe river basin north china plain the flood season is from june to september the effective irrigation area is 933 km2 the main crops include wheat 81 corn 81 cotton 16 other cash crops 1 0 and other grain crops 2 0 and the multiple crop index was 1 81 agricultural water use in this area comes from precipitation surface water and underground water surface water is provided jointly by the gangnan reservoir and huangbizhuang reservoir the two reservoirs supply the domestic industrial and urban environment water to shijiazhuang the capital of hebei province in addition to the shijin irrigation district and the lingzheng and jisan irrigation districts the huangbizhuang reservoir supplies water first and when water is insufficient the gangnan reservoir supplies water to users through the huangbizhuang reservoir the location of the shijin irrigation district and reservoirs is shown in fig 1 2 2 sequential clustering method to determine the rva target calculation period we used the sequential clustering method to test the mutation point of the outflow of huangbizhuang reservoir from 1995 to 2021 the sequential clustering method does not disturb the order in classification and the essence of predicting the mutation point was to seek the optimal segmentation point to minimize the sum of squares of deviation between the same classes and maximize the sum of squares of deviation between different classes suppose hydrological series is x 1 x 2 x n the possible mutation point is τ 2 τ n 1 and the sum of squares of deviation before and after the mutation point is 1 v τ i 1 τ x i x τ 2 2 v n τ i τ 1 n x i x n τ 2 where x τ 1 τ i 1 τ x i x n τ 1 n τ i τ 1 n x i 3 s n τ v τ v n τ if τ makes s min 2 τ n 1 s n τ then τ is the optimal segmentation point 2 3 rva target the rva target range for flow is usually based on a selected percentile level of the natural or predevelopment flow regime the rva target was calculated for the outflow of huangbizhuang reservoir began flood control in 1959 built into the current scale in 1968 during the flood season june to september from 1968 to 2021 to make the data series consistent the data from 1968 to 2021 were selected in this study according to the mutation point we divided the outflow time series into two periods the outflow before the mutation was regarded as the predevelopment flow and that after the mutation was regarded as the after development flow tian et al 2019 and gierszewski et al 2019 applied the same treatment to the division of the time series predevelopment and after development the predevelopment flow was not used because of the lack of measured data and on the other hand the dam has flood control irrigation power generation and other functions it was impossible to operate according to the natural flow regime the reservoir attempts to store water during the flood season and release water to generate hydroelectricity and supply water during the dry season therefore using data after development was more realistic the degree to which the rva target range was not attained is a measure of hydrologic alteration expected was used to describe the count of years for which the monthly average value was expected to fall within the targeted range in the predevelopment flow regime in the before mutation flow regime for this study observed was used to describe the count of years in which the observed monthly average value of the hydrologic parameter fell within the targeted range in the after development flow regime in the after mutation flow regime for this study this measure of hydrologic alteration expressed as a percentage can be calculated by richter et al 1998 4 observed expected expected 100 hydrological alteration values of 0 33 represent relatively unaltered 34 67 represent moderately altered 68 100 represent highly altered positive deviation indicates that values fell within the rva target more than expected negative deviation indicates that values fell within the rva target less than expected 2 4 field experiment field experiments were carried out from june 2004 to september 2010 encompassing seven summer maize growing seasons at the luancheng agroecological experimental station 37 89 n 114 69 e in shijiazhuang hebei province china luancheng station is an important grain producing area in china and a typical agricultural area in the mountain foot in the north china plain which has the ecological characteristics of intensive high yield resource constrained and well irrigation in 1999 it became a member of the global terrestrial observation system gtos the precipitation during the maize season june september was approximately 250 350 mm the sampling area is 5400 m2 which was established in 2004 the soil is loam the main physical characteristics of the soil are listed in table 1 sun et al 2015 the organic matter total nitrogen n rapidly available phosphorous p and rapidly available potassium k in the upper 0 2 m of soil were 23 85 g kg 1 5 g kg 37 3 mg kg and 112 04 mg kg respectively the maize variety was xianyu 335 which was sown in mid june and harvested in late september the current irrigation scheme is to irrigate 60 mm at the seedling stage and big trumpet stage the water source is underground well water all the fertilizers were applied in the big trumpet stage 269 3 kg ha n 10 1 kg ha p2o5 and 183 2 kg ha k2o the soil characteristics and nutrient level of the sampling site were representative in the shijin irrigation district and tillage fertilization and irrigation schemes represented the agricultural management measures commonly adopted by farmers in this area the above experimental data are derived from the soil science database http vdb3 soil csdb cn the parameters of the aquacrop model are calibrated with yield data 2 5 aquacrop model construction and evaluation the aquacrop model is a crop

luancheng experimental site were used for model construction and calibration as part of the meteorological data of luancheng station was missing it was replaced with that of nearby shijiazhuang station 38 02 n 114 42 e daily meteorological data are obtained from http cdc cma gov cn home do the groundwater table was set to 32 09 m below the soil surface the management was fixed to moderate soil fertility stress 10 cm height of soil bunds and 1 relative cover of weeds the initial soil water content was 75 of the field capacity the relative error re normalized root mean square error nrmse and residual accumulation coefficient crm were used to evaluate the precision of the aquacrop model the calculation formula is as follows 8 re m i s i s i 100 9 n r m s e i 1 i n s i m i 2 n s e 10 c

was considered that the model had good simulation performance the smaller the nrmse was the smaller the deviation between the simulated value and the measured value when crm 0 the simulation valuewas low and when crm 0 the simulation value was high 2 6 design and evaluation of irrigation schemes the growth periods of maize were divided into 11 periods and irrigation was carried out in the main growth periods bold in table 2 we set the irrigation times to once or twice among them scheme 0 was the current irrigation scheme 1 15 were the schemes for irrigation twice permutation and combination of growth periods each irrigation was half of the total irrigation volume 16 21 were the schemes for irrigation once each irrigation is half of the total irrigation volume 22 27 were the schemes for irrigation once each irrigation is the total irrigation volume the concepts of yield biomass crop water productivity wp soil water content and restoration of the groundwater table were used to evaluate the studied irrigation schemes 11 wp y et where wp is crop water productivity kg ha mm y is crop yield kg ha and et is the crop evapotranspiration mm the groundwater recharge from irrigation can be calculated by the following formula based on the data and reports from the luancheng water conservation office mao et al 2005 12 i r 0 12 i where i r is the groundwater recharge from irrigation mm and i is the depth of irrigation water mm the change in the groundwater table can be calculated by the groundwater balance equation mao et al 2005 sun et al 2015 13 d q μ a where d is the change in the groundwater table m q is the change in water amount which is defined as the difference between the drainage from the root zone profile and the irrigation water drawn m3 a is the calculated area m2 and μ is the specific yield which is 0 165 at the luancheng experimental site mao et al 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of the mutation point we calculated the monthly average outflow of huangbizhuang reservoir from 1968 to 2021 as seen from fig 2 the sequential clustering method was used to test the mutation point which was 1996 there was a catastrophic flood in 1996 precipitation for 2020 is missing the huangbizhuang reservoir is located in the centre of the rainstorm and the downstream outflow is the maximum since the construction of the reservoir before and after 1996 the variation trend of precipitation was relatively consistent the outflow before the mutation point had higher amplitudes compared to the postflood intervals because the huangbizhuang reservoir was reinforced from 1998 to 2003 the regulating storage capacity has been increased which can store more water to ensure the water demand of downstream water users 3 2 recommended reservoir outflow as shown in fig 3 and table 3 attainment of an rva target range defined by the 25th lower limit and 75th upper limit percentile values of reservoir outflow before the mutation 1968 1995 would be expected in only 50 of years richter et al 1998 therefore the reservoir outflow in the remaining 50 of years that does not meet the ecological water demand needs to be adjusted according to the rva target according to the recommended outflow in table 3 the total available water was 367 million m3 as the shijin irrigation district belongs to the groundwater overexploitation area groundwater was not considered in the calculation of total available water one third of the average annual domestic 40 million m3 industrial 20 million m3 and urban environment 4 million m3 water diversion as well as the lingzheng 55 million m3 and jisan 19 million m3 irrigation water were deducted the effective irrigation area of corn was 756 km2 the water loss rate was 29 7 from huangbizhuang reservoir to the shijin irrigation district gu et al 2017 according to the water balance the amount of water available for agricultural irrigation in the flood season is 63 million m3 84 mm under the rva target more discharge in june was due to the gradual release of water before the flood season to vacate storage capacity the outflow decreased in august and september because the irrigation water consumption was reduced for summer maize in addition the reservoir began to store water of course under special circumstances it shall be flexibly adjusted according to the inflow and the precipitation of the day the outflow in most years was within the rva target range after the mutation from fig 3 the variation degrees of june july august and september are 14 29 relatively unaltered 21 43 relatively unaltered 7 14 relatively unaltered and 35 71 moderately altered respectively calculated by formula 4 only in september was the variation degree of outflow slightly larger which needs to be the focus of regulation the above results indicated that the downstream water demand can be satisfied by regulating the outflow of huangbizhuang reservoir according to the rva target 3 3 calibration and validation of the aquacrop model the main parameters after calibration are shown in table 4 according to the simulation results in table 5 the model has high precision the aquacrop model had some errors 1 data errors including soil data weather data and survey data 2 errors caused by field management parameters that vary from region to region and 3 errors of the model itself such as the model cannot reflect the impact of pests and diseases 3 4 optimized irrigation scheme under the rva target 3 4 1 yield biomass and wp of different irrigation schemes irrigation amount and timing significantly affected maize yield as shown in fig 4 taking yield as the screening index three irrigation schemes better than the current scheme scheme 0 were selected and counted as shown in table 6 compared with scheme 0 the magnitude of the increase in yield is as follows scheme 22 scheme 1 scheme 16 scheme 22 increased the yield of crop and wp that were 17 kg ha and 1 kg ha mm higher than scheme 0 respectively the yield increased in scheme 1 and scheme 16 were 12 kg ha and 4 kg ha higher than that in scheme 0 respectively the wp of scheme 16 and scheme 1 was slightly different from that of scheme 0 combined with fig 5 overall there was a slight difference in biomass among the four schemes and the yield of the optimized irrigation schemes did not increase much however the agricultural land area in the north china plain is 17 98 million ha which is very large additionally our research proves that the current irrigation scheme is feasible and that there is room for further optimization therefore scheme 22 is recommended for summer maize production in years with more precipitation or upstream inflow in the main growth periods as an adequate irrigation method in terms of both yield and wp scheme 1 is for a normal year as shown in fig 4 the precipitation during the flood season from 2005 to 2007 was low but the yield was not the lowest we also showed the precipitation during the main growth periods it was found that the lower precipitation in the flood season from 2005 to 2007 did not affect the yield because the precipitation in the main growth periods was guaranteed it can be concluded that in the main growth periods of maize adequate precipitation and irrigation are the keys to ensuring stable yields in years with little precipitation or upstream inflow in the main growth periods scheme 16 as a limited irrigation or deficit irrigation method should be implemented the remaining water can be distributed to other industries higher grain yield and wp could be obtained by moderately regulating soil water depletion at the early stage of vegetative growth limited irrigation has been promoted in recent years some studies show that limited irrigation does not reduce yield but increases it zhang et al 2013 sun et al 2015 xu et al 2016 wang et al 2017 zou et al 2021 the results showed that ensuring water supply and meeting water demand at the seedling stage was the key to increasing yield there was less precipitation during this period and additional water was applied to ensure the growth of a whole seedling the jointing stage scheme 1 is the key period for vegetative growth and canopy development and water deficit has a great influence on yield from the large trumpet stage to the laddering period vegetative organs such as leaf enlargement and stem node elongation grow vigorously and reproductive organs such as male and female panicles differentiate and form lack of water can lead to malnourished and weak plants that are difficult to pollinate leading to severe production cuts there is more rainwater at the small trumpet stage and after anthesis so irrigation is not necessary deep soil water is the main water source for maize in the late growth period plants under limited irrigation used not only surface soil water but also deep soil water and thus had higher soil storage after harvest xu et al 2016 3 4 2 effects of soil water content on yield and wp the yield and wp are related to water consumption the average simulation results of the soil water content by the aquacrop model from 2004 to 2010 along the soil profiles of the three optimized schemes and the current irrigation scheme are shown in fig 6 there was no difference in the water content of topsoil 0 0 2 m under the different irrigation schemes while the different irrigation schemes had significant effects on the deep soil water content when the soil depth was 0 3 m the difference in water content at the same soil layer under different schemes gradually became obvious with a maximum difference of 7 when the soil depth was 0 5 m the water content of the four schemes was scheme 22 scheme 0 scheme 1 scheme 16 sufficient irrigation scheme 22 significantly increased the soil water content relative to limited irrigation scheme 16 scheme 16 had the lowest amount of irrigation water so the soil water content was the lowest but the yield did not decrease indicating that limited irrigation would increase crop yield zou et al 2021 and wp the use of soil water by crops is affected by soil water availability and the crop root system soil water use is related to root length and root length density distribution ninety five percent of the roots were concentrated in the 0 40 cm soil layer 0 40 cm is the main area of root water absorption so even the limited irrigation scheme 16 can basically guarantee the grain yield from the perspective of root water absorption potential scheme 0 scheme 22 scheme 1 scheme 16 before jointing the root length is shorter and undeveloped and maize mainly uses shallow soil water scheme 0 is more beneficial to plant growth at the jointing stage maize can form a strong root system secondary roots can be buried to a depth of approximately 2 m after jointing maize also uses deep soil water especially when water is scarce scheme 22 was more beneficial to plant growth the distribution of root length density is usually incorporated into the study of water and nitrate uptake as well as grain yield production wu et al 1999 zhang et al 2013 root length density peaks at anthesis and then declines over time barraclough and leigh 1984 as shown in table 2 there was more rainwater at the small trumpet stage and after anthesis but less rainwater from the seedling stage to the jointing stage and from the large trumpet stage to anthesis in general a slight water shortage during vegetative growth can increase vertical root penetration resulting in lower root length density in the upper soil and higher root length density in the deeper soil zhang et al 2004 li et al 2010 which helps to absorb more soil water for the big trumpet stage tasseling stage and anthesis in this region before jointing maize mainly carries on the root leaf growth and stem node differentiation and the root system is underdeveloped it is also appropriate for limited irrigation from the seedling stage to the jointing stage during these growing periods maize has a shorter root and does not need additional water absorbing shallow soil water from rainwater to meet growth needs the results of previous studies at the same site showed that when the root length density was less than 0 8 cm cm3 the root length density was a limiting factor for crops to make full use of soil water zhang et al 2004 the better root growth is the more water is extracted from deep soil which is significantly correlated with grain yield under limited water supply conditions improving soil water use by developing crop roots will make a significant contribution to yield scheme 22 is recommended for summer maize production in years with more precipitation however applying such an amount as 84 mm at once the seedling stage is very risky in a loamy texture we were lucky the soil texture changes from loamy surface 0 85 cm to silty clay loam at 85 165 cm and clay loam at 120 165 cm where the saturated hydraulic conductivity decreases from an average value of 745 3 mm we must relate the results to the soil texture preserving the moisture and reducing the leaching towards the groundwater this method of irrigation cannot be recommended everywhere unless we can secure even rainfall as it is related to specific soil conditions it resembles the split irrigation used in yemen on clay soils where precipitation water is converted down the slopes through canals to each farmer s plots using flood irrigation and then water is converted to the lower plots the more efficient use of water in scheme 16 where 42 mm was applied once at the seedling stage can support this conclusion 3 4 3 effects of optimized irrigation schemes on restoration of the groundwater table the groundwater recharge from irrigation was calculated by formula 12 which is 10 08 mm 10 08 mm and 5 04 mm for scheme 22 scheme 1 and scheme 16 respectively the groundwater table from irrigation will be restored to 0 062 m 0 062 m and 0 031 m for scheme 22 scheme 1 and scheme 16 respectively calculated by formula 13 additionally for the three optimized schemes replacing groundwater with surface water will reduce the extraction of groundwater by 120 mm compared with the current irrigation scheme scheme 0 formula 13 was used to convert this part of the groundwater to the water table there was no drainage and the calculated result was 0 727 m in comparison with scheme 22 and scheme 1 scheme 16 can save 42 mm for restoring 0 255 m of the groundwater table in conclusion under the rva target replacing groundwater with surface water can restore at least 0 727 m of the groundwater table which was beneficial to the ecological environment and the sustainable utilization of water resources scheme 22 and scheme 1 can restore the groundwater table by 0 789 m scheme 16 can restore 1 013 m of the groundwater table which was the most conducive scheme for groundwater recharge the observed average annual decline in the groundwater table in the past three decades was 1 04 m a at luancheng station sun et al 2015 in this research the replacement of irrigation water from groundwater with surface water was more important therefore reducing the exploitation of groundwater for agricultural irrigation is an effective way to protect groundwater in this area et is the main factor affecting the change in the groundwater table and reducing ineffective et is an effective measure to alleviate the decline in the groundwater table yang et al 2015 strengthening soil nutrient management wang et al 2006 enhancing the breeding of drought tolerant varieties passioura et al 2006 and strengthening soil surface management hou et al 2012 are effective measures to reduce ineffective et yang et al 2006 reported that reducing the average annual et by 76 mm equivalent to reducing irrigation by 100 mm can alleviate the decline in the groundwater table by 0 42 m year while reducing the yield of winter wheat by only 5 additionally diversified crop rotations can also mitigate the decline in the groundwater table yang et al 2015 of course the studies mentioned above are based on the use of groundwater for irrigation if less or no groundwater is used the groundwater table will rise further in future research we will focus on the impact of adjusting the planting structure of crops and increasing field management measures such as mulching film on groundwater recovery some schemes can be selected to further accelerate groundwater recovery 4 conclusions the amount of water available for agricultural irrigation in the flood season was 63 million m3 84 mm under the rva target more important was the replacement of irrigation water from groundwater with surface water there are three optimal irrigation schemes for reference scheme 22 is recommended for summer maize production in years with more precipitation or upstream inflow in the main growth periods as an adequate irrigation method in years with little precipitation or upstream inflow in the main growth periods scheme 16 as a limited irrigation or deficit irrigation method should be implemented scheme 1 is recommended for a normal year under the rva target replacing groundwater with surface water can restore at least 0 727 m of the groundwater table scheme 22 and scheme 1 can restore the groundwater table by 0 789 m scheme 16 can restore 1 013 m of the groundwater table which is the most conducive scheme for groundwater recharge we provide a research idea and method but the research results may not be applicable to all regions other regions with similar different climates could refer to our research ideas but the formulation of specific irrigation schemes should integrate local climate water availability soil texture and other factors in the future the main rivers upstream of the shijin irrigation district will be selected as ecological monitoring points to monitor the species and abundance of fish zooplankton phytoplankton algae and benthic organisms the ecological limits of hydrologic alteration eloha poff et al 2010 are used to establish an ecological flow target which is comprehensive and targeted in addition the field experiment will be carried out in the shijin irrigation district in the future to compare the yield of the three optimized and current irrigation schemes and then determine the optimal irrigation

9294,research results on the effects of environmental factors on tree water use growth and water use efficiency vary latitudinally and geographically and the conclusions remain controversial in this study we investigated the tree transpiration et basal area increment bai and water use efficiency wue of a typical plantation tree species schima superba in south china aiming to identify the dominant environmental factors in regulating and affecting the tree water use and growth datasets including the continuously measured sap flow and meteorological parameters as well as the periodically measured diameter at breast height and height of observed sample trees were collected during the period from 2008 to 2021 the redundancy analysis results indicated the significant effects of air temperature t and humidity rh on tree et bai and wue according to pearson correlations among the environmental factors we divided them into heat group and water group and conducted the variation partitioning analysis results highlighted that it was the heat factors including air temperature and solar radiation rather than the water factors that explained the larger variations of et bai and wue the abundant total precipitation in south china and the ability to take advantage of deep soil moisture of s superba weakened the role of water but emphasized the effect of heat considering the current growth and the water use of s superba and the obvious climate changes in recent decades in south china it is concluded that this species can maintain its growth under the current climate conditions overall our study demonstrates a more important role of heat factors compared to water factors in regulating tree water use growth and wue in subtropical s superba plantations which could offer a promising implication for the management of subtropical plantations under future climate trajectories keywords transpiration tree growth water use efficiency climate factors subtropical plantation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nowadays global climate change due to the increase of greenhouse gases such as atmospheric co2 and the resulting rise in air temperature have altered precipitation patterns the changing temperature and precipitation patterns can trigger frequent and severe droughts in semi arid and arid regions spinoni et al 2018 even in some subtropical areas like south china that receive abundant rain ouyang et al 2020 these changes will influence tree physiology and forest ecology by altering the plants carbon water relationships körner 2000 tree transpiration is the process of water movement from roots to leaves where the moisture evaporates into the air it connects leaf carbon assimilation and ecosystem functions and can indicate the forest responses to climatic changes and soil water status lu et al 2020 zhou et al 2011 it is jointly controlled by the climatic and environmental variables such as vapor pressure deficit vpd net radiation rn air temperature t precipitation p and soil moisture sm ouyang et al 2020 2022b novick et al 2016 grossiord et al 2018 for instance liu and bondi 2020 reported that the sap flow based transpiration of pines growing in nevada was mainly limited by evaporative demands when water resources are abundant while soil moisture became the dominant factor when water availability decreased wang et al 2011 aimed to sort out the contributions of heat water and pollutant variables to the transpiration of six urban tree species in beijing in north china and found that the heat and water factors rather than the atmospheric pollutants mainly regulated the tree transpiration whereas our previous study on tree water use along an urban rural environmental gradient demonstrated that the pollutant emission exerted more impact on sap flow than climatic factors in south china ouyang et al 2022a though it is widely accepted that tree level sap flux at daily or longer temporal scales is generally controlled by vpd variations and soil moisture the relative sensitivity of sap flux to these factors under long term environmental conditions has rarely been determined experimentally grossiord et al 2018 similarly tree growth is also determined by air temperature radiation potential evapotranspiration precipitation and the seasonal patterns of these climatic variables zuidema et al 2022 fyllas et al 2017 for instance the annual woody biomass growth responds positively to dry season precipitation but negatively to dry season maximum temperature and the responding degree to these dry season climate factors varies among sites zuidema et al 2022 generally sufficient water supply moderate temperatures and high humidity could favor fast biomass accumulations while extreme temperature or drought usually leads to less or decreased biomass increment in this context the dominant role of environmental variables and the degree of their influence on transpiration and tree growth always vary with climatic region time and tree species therefore no definite conclusions have been reached over the long term scale and further research in this respect is needed water use efficiency wue defined as the ratio of the increased biomass to the water transpired during a given period provides a necessary multi scale reflection of the coupling of water transpiration and carbon assimilation bogeat triboulot et al 2019 previous literature has systematically analyzed the drivers of carbon gain process and water use jiang et al 2022 mathias and thomas 2021 and showed the crucial roles of water and energy on wue chen et al 2022 in arid or semi arid regions the significant increase in intrinsic wue could be attributed to the decrease of stomatal conductance as temperature increased or soil moisture decreased jia et al 2022 nevertheless research results from wang et al 2020 showed significant positive relationships between temperature or precipitation and annual wue in the tibetan plateau another study had proposed that the climate changes would have a negative effect on wue in south china but a positive effect in north china in the future emphasizing the zonal difference of climate zhu et al 2011 recently there is an ongoing controversy on the relative role of vpd and sm in determining the ecosystem production efficiency and different viewpoints were reported liu et al 2020 lu et al 2020 these works highlighted the challenge and necessity for disentangling of respective effects of environmental factors on ecosystem processes lu et al 2020 since wue is a key indicator linking plant productivity and water resources quantifying the spatiotemporal variations in wue and clarifying the dominant drivers could better understand the response of ecosystem to the current and future climatic conditions and also improve the prediction of climate impacts on forest ecosystems jiang et al 2022 differing from other subtropical drylands china has the largest subtropical evergreen broadleaf forest which has been considered as an important carbon sink song et al 2020 meanwhile subtropical china is sensitive to global changes and has experienced obvious regional climate change zhou et al 2011 generally the climate changes including air temperature and precipitation patterns vary latitudinally and geographically suggesting different effects of climate changes on subtropical forest water use schlaepfer et al 2017 while related studies mainly focused on the arid and semi arid regions qin et al 2022 jia et al 2022 in addition plantations had been widely planted to recover the degraded hilly lands since the 1980 s in south china benefiting from the wide ecological niche timber application and fire resistance the native species schima superba is commonly planted and often regarded as a pioneer species for ecological restoration in barren hills shrubs and forests however how this species will perform trade off between its water use and growth to adapt to the changing environment in a long term remains uncertain in this study we collected the data of continuously monitored sap flow and periodically measured growth in term of basal area increment bai of s superba trees and local environmental factors during 2008 2021 the objectives were to investigate the temporal dynamic changes in transpiration tree growth and wue of s superba in such long term experiment and therefore to clarify their dominant driving factors given the fact that the extension of dry season with more severe aridity has occurred in south china within the recent 30 years hu et al 2018 we hypothesized that the local soil water availability especially in the dry season plays an equally important role as solar radiation and air temperature in determining transpiration growth and wue of s superba 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was conducted in a s superba plantation planted in the mid 1980 s located in the south china botanical garden guangzhou guangdong province china 23 10 n 113 21 e from january 2008 to december 2021 characterized by a subtropical oceanic monsoon climate guangzhou has a mean annual temperature of 22 c and receives mean annual precipitation of about 1700 mm generally more than 75 of the precipitation fall in the wet season from april to september and less raining occurs in the dry season from october to march of the next year the s superba trees were planted with an average plant spacing of 2 5 m 2 5 m and have experienced no human disturbance since planting the current stand grows in a gentle slope with a density of 603 trees per hectare the leaf area index of the plantation generally ranged from 3 to 4 m2 m 2 soil texture of the experimental site was loam with a soil ph value of 3 95 0 22 and topsoil 0 20 cm organic matter content of 22 52 4 61 g kg 1 respectively the total nitrogen n content available phosphorous p content and available potassium k of the topsoil were 0 68 0 27 g kg 1 1 74 0 57 mg kg 1 and 29 59 9 27 mg kg 1 respectively 2 2 environmental parameters the meteorological data including net radiation rn mj m2 air temperature t c relative humidity rh and precipitation p mm were hourly recorded at a nearby meteorological station wushan meteorological station about 2 km away from the experimental site vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was calculated from t and rh using the equation described in campbell and norman 1998 as follows 1 vpd a exp b t t c 1 rh where a b and c are constants set to 0 611 17 502 and 240 97 respectively daily potential evapotranspiration pet is estimated following the hamon s method hamon 1963 federer and brook 1978 2 pet 0 1651 d vd where d is the time from sunrise to sunset in multiples of 12 h and was also obtained from the wushan meteorological station vd is the saturated vapor density g m 3 at the daily mean temperature tdaily and is calculated by the equation of vd 216 7 vs t 273 3 vs is the saturated vapor pressure mb and is calculated by vs 6 108 exp 17 26939 t t 237 3 once the estimated pet is obtained we can calculate the monthly and annual p pet dryness index federer and brook 1978 zhou et al 2015 soil water content swc was continuously monitored using three soil water probes sm300 delta t devices ltd cambridge uk that were buried at the depth of 30 cm beneath the soil surface 2 3 sap flow measurement total of twenty one sample trees of good health and different diameters at breast height dbh in the experimental plot were chosen as the sample trees for the sap flow measurements sample tree distribution was displayed in supplementary figure 1 according to an inventory survey within the experimental site we used lab made thermal dissipation probes tdps according to the prototype of granier s tdp to monitor the sap flux density a pair of tdp sensors were vertically 10 13 cm apart inserted into the xylem of sample trees at the breast height 1 3 above the ground and 2 cm deep on the north side of the stem the upper probe consisted of a copper constantan thermocouple and a heating element of constantan that was heated by a constant dc of 120 ma while the lower one remained unheated and served as a temperature reference the probes were covered by a plastic cover and an aluminum reflective foil to protect against mechanical disturbance radiation and rain the monitoring of sap flow was carried out from 2008 to 2021 detailed information for the sap flow measurement was described in ouyang et al 2020 and the sap flux density j s g h2o m 1 s 1 was calculated by the following equation granier 1987 3 j s 119 t m t t 1 231 where t m is the maximum temperature difference under zero flux conditions and t is the instantaneous temperature difference between the heated and the unheated probes the original voltage difference in proportion to the temperature difference between the two probes were read every 30 s and averaged every 10 min and recorded by a delta t data loggers dl2e delta t devices ltd cambridge uk and then converted to j s using baseliner 3 0 program 2 4 tree transpiration tree growth and water use efficiency we chose seven non sampled trees with different dbh within the plot and drilled wood cores using a borer of 5 mm in diameter the sapwood depths were directly measured from the cores by distinguishing the different colors between sapwood and heartwood the dbh and tree height h of sampled trees were annually hand measured the allometric equation between dbh and a s was established and used to calculate the sapwood area of the sampled trees we had performed a measurement to study the radial variation of sap flow of s superba the results at the same site showed that significant difference in j s in different sapwood depths was observed p 0 0001 the duncan test results showed that the j s of s superba was similar when sapwood depth is less than 4 cm but decreased to 45 of that at the most outer 0 2 cm depth when the sapwood depth was greater than 4 cm mei et al 2010 therefore in this study the whole tree transpiration was estimated by using the equation e j s 0 4 cm a s 0 4 cm 0 45 j s 0 4 cm a s 4 cm to remove the effect of tree size on whole tree transpiration we adopted a normalized tree transpiration et expressed as e dbh proposed by besson et al 2014 data missing is a common and inevitable problem when conducting a long term sap flow measurement due to probe or power failure to fill the missing data we firstly established the linear or exponential saturation regressions between the j s and the monitored photosynthetically active radiation par or vpd using the available data for every single tree within each month the j s and par readings were collected with 10 min resolution by the delta t data loggers at our own micro meteorological station on an observation tower within the stand and thus the sample size of the data is large enough to establish the linear or exponential regressions with significant regression relationships r2 0 5 p 0 05 secondly we calculated the missing j s values based on the established regression equations lastly the complete j s data can be scaled up to obtain the monthly and annual transpiration because of its smaller dependence on tree age the annual basal area increment bai cm2 year 1 is generally regarded as an indicator of tree growth battipaglia et al 2013 studies proposed that the bai can increase the accuracy in the climate response of tree growth ding et al 2021 mohr et al 2019 we calculated the bai as follows 4 bai π rn 2 rn 1 2 where r is the tree radius at breast height and n is the year since it is strictly forbidden to cut down any trees in the south china botanical garden the biomass of our sample trees was calculated by the allometric equation between tree biomass and dbh h established from a s superba stand of similar age in the heshan national field research station of forest ecosystem 22 41 n 112 54 e which is near guangzhou city and shares a similar climate and soil conditions specifically we fell down seven s superba trees of different dbh at the station measured the dbh tree height h and oven dried and weighed the leaf stem branch and root biomass of the felled trees then the allometric equations were established and listed as follows 5 above ground biomass 0 1521 dbh2 h 0 8068 n 7 r2 0 89 6 under ground biomass 0 0879 dbh2 h 0 6701 n 7 r2 0 91 therefore we can calculate the biomass of sampled trees every year based on their dbh and h water use efficiency wue was calculated as the ratio of the increment of whole tree biomass to the whole tree transpiration in every year δbiomass e 2 5 statistical analysis linear regressions were used to indicate the linear trends of mean annual temperature mat and wue as well as the relationships between monthly transpiration annual wue and environmental factors during the whole experimental period pearson correlation coefficients were calculated among the environmental factors including t rh p rn vpd swc and p pet we conducted a series of redundancy analyses rda according to a both side selection option to clarify the dominant drivers on tree transpiration growth and wue only the significant environmental variables identified in this process were included in subsequent analyses the collinearity between the environmental variables usually complicates the assessment of environment induced impacts on tree water use therefore the collinear factors will be classified into two groups namely heat group and water group to explore their combined effects according to the results of linear regression matrix specifically those parameters that refer to the energy such as net radiation and air temperature were classified as heat group while the relative humidity soil moisture and precipitation were regarded as water group wang et al 2011 then the variation partitioning was performed to obtain the partition variance of tree transpiration annual bai and annual wue we plotted the environmental factors et bai and wue by origin 18 0 all the statistical analysis and related figures were conducted using r version 3 5 3 r development core team 2018 and we denoted significant differences at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 environmental factors the values of t rh p rn vpd and swc in the wet season were generally higher than those in the dry season showing clear seasonal variations during the whole experimental period figs 1 and 2 the mat was between 22 0 and 24 0 c and the mean temperature ranged from 16 3 to 21 0 c in the dry season and from 26 6 to 28 5 c in the wet season respectively mean annual precipitation map ranged from 1472 mm 2011 to 2457 mm 2016 and the precipitation in the wet season accounted for more than 70 of the annual total the rn in dry season ranged from 3 62 to 4 99 mj m 2 but increased to the values between 6 22 and 8 87 mj m 2 in the wet season the largest and lowest averaged annual vpd occurred in 2009 and 2011 being 0 89 kpa and 0 64 kpa respectively similar temporal changes of swc were also observed resulting from the abundant rainfall swc reached the seasonal maximum of 28 35 during the wet months whereas the values dropped to about 20 during the dry months in terms of the annual dryness index p pet we found only the year 2009 and 2021 experienced a value of less than 1 indicating a potential drought because of uneven distribution of the precipitation in the whole year monthly p pet showed an obvious seasonal variation with potential drought mainly occurring in winter furthermore the mat during the period from 2008 2021 showed a significant increasing trend p 0 05 while the other parameters just fluctuated within a certain range fig 3 pearson correlation coefficients showed the collinear relationships among the environmental variables fig 4 the results indicated that t vpd and rn were highly correlated with each other p 0 001 similarly significant positive correlations were also presented among precipitation relative humidity and dryness index while the soil water content was mainly related to precipitation p 0 001 3 2 tree transpiration bai and wue seasonal changes in et from 2008 to 2021 were shown in fig 5 within every single year et gradually increased to a seasonal maximum during the wet season and then decreased due to unfavorable environmental conditions water light or heat availability and leaf senescence the greatest tree transpiration usually occurred in the summer and early autumn from june to october reaching values of more than 30 kg m 1 limited by the lower air temperature soil moisture and solar radiation et values were generally lower during the winter with values mainly ranging from 10 to 20 kg m 1 during the whole experimental period the lowest annual whole tree transpiration occurred in 2008 while trees in 2011 had the strongest transpiration and all the et values fluctuated between 200 and 310 kg m 1 fig 6a annual dbh h and bai experienced relatively significant increases throughout the experimental years fig 6b and c for example the values of annual bai were less than 30 cm2 year 1 at the early stage while the increment values reached more than 30 cm2 year 1 during the recent 2 years due to the relatively stable tree transpiration and the increase in the biomass increment annual wue also significantly increased over the years fig 6d p 0 05 results showed that the minimum wue occurred in 2008 with values of 2 25 0 57 g biomass kg h2o while the wue values have increased to 4 73 0 81 in 2017 and 4 67 0 56 g biomass kg h2o in 2021 respectively 3 3 relationships of et bai and wue with environmental factors we established the linear relationships between monthly et and all environmental factors fig 7 results indicated significant positive correlations between monthly et and air temperature vpd rn and swc with the r 2 values ranging from 0 13 to 0 54 p 0 05 nevertheless the linear relationships between transpiration and other factors including precipitation relative humidity dryness index were not significant data not shown differing from monthly transpiration annual bai only presented significant linear correlations with air temperature and swc in the dry season fig 8 p 0 05 with smaller variations in annual vpd and rn linear relationships were not significant between these factors and bai in addition on the larger time scale the linear regression relationships between annual wue and most monitored environmental factors were not significant only annual mean air temperature and averaged swc in the dry season showed significantly positive linear relationships with annual wue with r 2 values between 0 34 and 0 59 fig 9 p 0 05 3 4 variation partitioning analyses on et bai and wue redundancy analysis rda results showed that the t and rh were the main factors significantly affecting monthly transpiration annual bai and wue p 0 05 according to the strong correlations of environmental variables shown in fig 4 we classified t and rn as heat group and rh p and swc as water group as presented in fig 10 when the variance of monthly transpiration was decomposed the heat t and rn and the water rh p and swc variables accounted for an average variance of 50 and 9 respectively the shared effects of heat and water groups were 6 on the variance of et and the amount of variation captured by all of the selected explanatory variables was collectively 65 since vpd and p pet were calculated from the aforementioned factors their effects were separately listed benefiting from the combination of t and rh the explanation of vpd for et was relatively high with a value being 52 while p pet had weak individual effects and only explained 2 of the variation for monthly transpiration in addition the heat and water groups explained 24 and 7 of the variance of annual bai respectively while vpd and p pet just showed weak explanations similar to the effect on et the heat variables still ranked as the greatest ones in influencing annual wue with a contribution rate of 46 whereas the water group had a weak individual effects 1 on annual wue and no shared effects were observed moreover the proportions of variances of vpd and p pet for wue accounted for only 6 fig 10 4 discussion in this study the seasonal variation of transpiration could be attributed to the changing climatic and swc conditions which was supported by the established linear relationships between et and the related factors fig 7 under higher air temperature more sufficient solar radiation and sufficient soil water supply trees generally transpired more water in the wet and the early stage of dry season which in accordance with many previous studies obojes et al 2018 ouyang et al 2022b differing from our hypothesis the water related factors such as precipitation rarely exerted significant explanation on tree monthly et from 2008 to 2021 implying no water limitation on s superba plantations in this region moreover the variation partitioning analysis highlighted the importance of heat factor such as air temperature and net radiation rather than the water factors on tree monthly transpiration a similar result reported that these two variables were the potential important predictors for the daily transpiration of tested tree species in beijing in north china wang et al 2011 also several studies have indicated that evapotranspiration was mainly driven by radiation in humid regions jiang et al 2022 aguilos et al 2019 the most reliable explanation for our results could be attributed to the regional climatic characteristics on one hand water is the main limiting factor for forests in semi arid and arid areas reduced precipitation and decreased soil moisture generally resulted in less transpiration grossiord et al 2018 wang et al 2017 pangle et al 2015 however in our study the abundant precipitation total annual precipitation ranging from 1400 mm to 2300 mm keeps the swc values around 20 even in dry seasons which were still higher than those of arid areas on the other hand our previous study showed that s superba trees have roots as deep as 50 60 cm and were proved to be able to take advantage of deeper soil moisture 40 60 cm under dry conditions according to the estimated xylem water δ 18o values ouyang et al 2020 therefore the plenty of rainfall and the ability to utilize deep soil water make the water related factors less crucial and thus highlight the role of the heat factors a remarkable result in our study is that the tree bai positively and negatively responded to the mat and swc respectively p 0 05 the heat and water groups accounted for 19 shared effects on the variance of bai suggesting a combined effect of water and heat both positive and negative effects of air temperature on tree growth have also been reported jia et al 2022 dixit et al 2022 chen et al 2022 fu et al 2020 for instance air temperature is the main limiting factor for tree growth in permafrost regions zhang et al 2016 mcmahon et al 2010 and thus an extension of the growing season caused by the increase in temperature can facilitate tree growth oishi et al 2018 jia et al 2015 also proposed that a warmer climate accompanied by less water stress at the end of the growing season can benefit carbon storage for the following growing season in our case with abundant rainfall and the above mentioned ability to utilize deep soil water a higher temperature can promote s superba trees to capture carbon resources for biomass increment even in the autumn and winter and the carbon storage might facilitate the formation of the earlywood in the next year litton et al 2007 the sufficient radiation in the autumn is also conducive to the wood growth of trees which was confirmed by a dendroecological study in the same area of this research li et al 2020 the relatively favorable environment finally leads to the positive effect of air temperature on the tree growth of s superba however the negative relationship between bai and swc was unexpected and a similar result was observed by xie et al 2016 who reported a negative relationship between precipitation and gross ecosystem production in spring also zuidema et al 2022 conducted a pantropical tree ring network research and found a weak negative response of tree growth to precipitation occurring at sites with relatively high water availability research has proposed that the negative response may reflect radiation limitation of photosynthesis as the radiation limitation is thought to occur when map 2000 mm wagner et al 2016 in other words frequent cloudy and rainy weather reduced the stomatal opening and therefore decreased the co2 uptake despite the unexpected result we tend to think that it was the mat not the swc dominated the change in bai such effect of swc on annual bai is likely to be overestimated due to the reason of scale effect i e annual growth and was supported by the fact that only 1 of the variation on bai explained by water factors unlike the previous studies which reported the decoupled relationship between bai and wue giguere croteau et al 2019 lévesque et al 2014 we found that both bai and wue experienced an increasing trend throughout the experimental period researchers attributed the decoupling of bai with wue to the more vulnerable xylem conduits and the unsustainable growth resulting from the low carbon assimilation rate zadworny et al 2019 as well as the inaccessibility of deep water under water limited conditions jia et al 2022 however such conditions hardly occurred in our study as shown in fig 5 the transpiration of s superba remained relatively vigorous especially in the recent three years 2018 2021 even in the dry season meanwhile proved by the values of swc and the previously measured root depth the s superba was less likely to suffer from a severe drought compared with those species of other studies as a result s superba was able to maintain relatively stable transpiration promote the increase of wue and ultimately improve its growth even under the condition of dry season fig 6 similar to the bai annual tree wue was positively correlated with the mat but negatively correlated with swc in the dry season fig 9 confirming the viewpoint stressing the role of dry season climate variability in driving the trade off between tree water use and growth zuidema et al 2022 it is widely accepted that decreased soil water can lead to tight stomatal control and limited transpiration rates fu et al 2020 trees are prone to improve the wue to cope with the potential drought when soil water supply decreases while the increase of mat increased biomass as previously discussed and consequently led to higher wue values under such conditions urrutia jalabert et al 2015 the responses of tree growth and transpiration to environmental variables over a long term determined the variations in wue and the heat factors also showed a relatively stronger explanation for the wue compared with the water factors fig 10 therefore we proposed that in rainy south china air temperature and solar radiation that explained more variance variability in et played more important roles in regulating the tree s water use efficiency climate changes have induced a warmer atmosphere and obvious changes in rainfall patterns the observed correlations between climate and typical tree species growth at a given climatic zone are often used to estimate tree health and growth in the future charney et al 2016 whether the potential benefits of high wue can offset the negative impacts of climate change remains uncertain friedlingstein et al 2013 this study provided 14 years of monitored data about the water transpiration and growth of the native s superba trees and the responses to the climate factors and soil water content differing from our hypothesis the results emphasized the importance of heat factors especially air temperature to tree water use growth and wue and possible reasons were due to the climate condition in south china and the water use strategy of s superba in addition the increasing trend of bai indicated the s superba is still in a good situation under current climatic conditions as proposed that trees bai trend would not decrease unless trees begin to senesce duchesne et al 2003 jia et al 2022 owing to the relatively deeper root depth and the sufficient soil water supply in south china we can expect that s superba could have an advantage in maintaining its growth when facing the possibly prolonged drought and small increases in atmospheric temperature in the future further research should focus on the sensitivity of the functional traits especially those related to photosynthesis and water use efficiency of typical tree species to the climatic and environmental drivers bauman et al 2022 5 conclusion our study investigated the sap flow based transpiration tree growth and water use efficiency of the native s superba plantation during the period from 2008 to 2021 in subtropical south china the annual transpiration was vigorous and fluctuated while the bai and wue showed a significant increase trend during the whole period the temporal change of monthly et has been affected by a variety of environmental factors such as air temperature rn vpd and swc the annual bai and wue presented significant linear regressions with mat and swc in the dry season we have demonstrated the significant effects of t and rh on et bai and wue and divided the environmental factors into two groups heat group and water group based on their pearson correlations the variation partitioning analysis indicated that the heat factors including air temperature and solar radiation explained larger variations of et bai and wue than the water factors whereas the vpd and dryness index rarely influence the bai and wue therefore our results suggested that it was the heat factors especially air temperature rather than the water factors that regulate the tree transpiration growth and wue of s superba additionally due to the advantages in obtaining deeper soil water the s superba trees can deal with the current climate conditions such as uneven distribution of rainfall to maintain their growth the climate responses of the typical subtropical tree growth and wue elucidated from this study can enhance the understanding of how the water and carbon related plant physiological processes will respond to the future climate dynamic changes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

9294,research results on the effects of environmental factors on tree water use growth and water use efficiency vary latitudinally and geographically and the conclusions remain controversial in this study we investigated the tree transpiration et basal area increment bai and water use efficiency wue of a typical plantation tree species schima superba in south china aiming to identify the dominant environmental factors in regulating and affecting the tree water use and growth datasets including the continuously measured sap flow and meteorological parameters as well as the periodically measured diameter at breast height and height of observed sample trees were collected during the period from 2008 to 2021 the redundancy analysis results indicated the significant effects of air temperature t and humidity rh on tree et bai and wue according to pearson correlations among the environmental factors we divided them into heat group and water group and conducted the variation partitioning analysis results highlighted that it was the heat factors including air temperature and solar radiation rather than the water factors that explained the larger variations of et bai and wue the abundant total precipitation in south china and the ability to take advantage of deep soil moisture of s superba weakened the role of water but emphasized the effect of heat considering the current growth and the water use of s superba and the obvious climate changes in recent decades in south china it is concluded that this species can maintain its growth under the current climate conditions overall our study demonstrates a more important role of heat factors compared to water factors in regulating tree water use growth and wue in subtropical s superba plantations which could offer a promising implication for the management of subtropical plantations under future climate trajectories keywords transpiration tree growth water use efficiency climate factors subtropical plantation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nowadays global climate change due to the increase of greenhouse gases such as atmospheric co2 and the resulting rise in air temperature have altered precipitation patterns the changing temperature and precipitation patterns can trigger frequent and severe droughts in semi arid and arid regions spinoni et al 2018 even in some subtropical areas like south china that receive abundant rain ouyang et al 2020 these changes will influence tree physiology and forest ecology by altering the plants carbon water relationships körner 2000 tree transpiration is the process of water movement from roots to leaves where the moisture evaporates into the air it connects leaf carbon assimilation and ecosystem functions and can indicate the forest responses to climatic changes and soil water status lu et al 2020 zhou et al 2011 it is jointly controlled by the climatic and environmental variables such as vapor pressure deficit vpd net radiation rn air temperature t precipitation p and soil moisture sm ouyang et al 2020 2022b novick et al 2016 grossiord et al 2018 for instance liu and bondi 2020 reported that the sap flow based transpiration of pines growing in nevada was mainly limited by evaporative demands when water resources are abundant while soil moisture became the dominant factor when water availability decreased wang et al 2011 aimed to sort out the contributions of heat water and pollutant variables to the transpiration of six urban tree species in beijing in north china and found that the heat and water factors rather than the atmospheric pollutants mainly regulated the tree transpiration whereas our previous study on tree water use along an urban rural environmental gradient demonstrated that the pollutant emission exerted more impact on sap flow than climatic factors in south china ouyang et al 2022a though it is widely accepted that tree level sap flux at daily or longer temporal scales is generally controlled by vpd variations and soil moisture the relative sensitivity of sap flux to these factors under long term environmental conditions has rarely been determined experimentally grossiord et al 2018 similarly tree growth is also determined by air temperature radiation potential evapotranspiration precipitation and the seasonal patterns of these climatic variables zuidema et al 2022 fyllas et al 2017 for instance the annual woody biomass growth responds positively to dry season precipitation but negatively to dry season maximum temperature and the responding degree to these dry season climate factors varies among sites zuidema et al 2022 generally sufficient water supply moderate temperatures and high humidity could favor fast biomass accumulations while extreme temperature or drought usually leads to less or decreased biomass increment in this context the dominant role of environmental variables and the degree of their influence on transpiration and tree growth always vary with climatic region time and tree species therefore no definite conclusions have been reached over the long term scale and further research in this respect is needed water use efficiency wue defined as the ratio of the increased biomass to the water transpired during a given period provides a necessary multi scale reflection of the coupling of water transpiration and carbon assimilation bogeat triboulot et al 2019 previous literature has systematically analyzed the drivers of carbon gain process and water use jiang et al 2022 mathias and thomas 2021 and showed the crucial roles of water and energy on wue chen et al 2022 in arid or semi arid regions the significant increase in intrinsic wue could be attributed to the decrease of stomatal conductance as temperature increased or soil moisture decreased jia et al 2022 nevertheless research results from wang et al 2020 showed significant positive relationships between temperature or precipitation and annual wue in the tibetan plateau another study had proposed that the climate changes would have a negative effect on wue in south china but a positive effect in north china in the future emphasizing the zonal difference of climate zhu et al 2011 recently there is an ongoing controversy on the relative role of vpd and sm in determining the ecosystem production efficiency and different viewpoints were reported liu et al 2020 lu et al 2020 these works highlighted the challenge and necessity for disentangling of respective effects of environmental factors on ecosystem processes lu et al 2020 since wue is a key indicator linking plant productivity and water resources quantifying the spatiotemporal variations in wue and clarifying the dominant drivers could better understand the response of ecosystem to the current and future climatic conditions and also improve the prediction of climate impacts on forest ecosystems jiang et al 2022 differing from other subtropical drylands china has the largest subtropical evergreen broadleaf forest which has been considered as an important carbon sink song et al 2020 meanwhile subtropical china is sensitive to global changes and has experienced obvious regional climate change zhou et al 2011 generally the climate changes including air temperature and precipitation patterns vary latitudinally and geographically suggesting different effects of climate changes on subtropical forest water use schlaepfer et al 2017 while related studies mainly focused on the arid and semi arid regions qin et al 2022 jia et al 2022 in addition plantations had been widely planted to recover the degraded hilly lands since the 1980 s in south china benefiting from the wide ecological niche timber application and fire resistance the native species schima superba is commonly planted and often regarded as a pioneer species for ecological restoration in barren hills shrubs and forests however how this species will perform trade off between its water use and growth to adapt to the changing environment in a long term remains uncertain in this study we collected the data of continuously monitored sap flow and periodically measured growth in term of basal area increment bai of s superba trees and local environmental factors during 2008 2021 the objectives were to investigate the temporal dynamic changes in transpiration tree growth and wue of s superba in such long term experiment and therefore to clarify their dominant driving factors given the fact that the extension of dry season with more severe aridity has occurred in south china within the recent 30 years hu et al 2018 we hypothesized that the local soil water availability especially in the dry season plays an equally important role as solar radiation and air temperature in determining transpiration growth and wue of s superba 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was conducted in a s superba plantation planted in the mid 1980 s located in the south china botanical garden guangzhou guangdong province china 23 10 n 113 21 e from january 2008 to december 2021 characterized by a subtropical oceanic monsoon climate guangzhou has a mean annual temperature of 22 c and receives mean annual precipitation of about 1700 mm generally more than 75 of the precipitation fall in the wet season from april to september and less raining occurs in the dry season from october to march of the next year the s superba trees were planted with an average plant spacing of 2 5 m 2 5 m and have experienced no human disturbance since planting the current stand grows in a gentle slope with a density of 603 trees per hectare the leaf area index of the plantation generally ranged from 3 to 4 m2 m 2 soil texture of the experimental site was loam with a soil ph value of 3 95 0 22 and topsoil 0 20 cm organic matter content of 22 52 4 61 g kg 1 respectively the total nitrogen n content available phosphorous p content and available potassium k of the topsoil were 0 68 0 27 g kg 1 1 74 0 57 mg kg 1 and 29 59 9 27 mg kg 1 respectively 2 2 environmental parameters the meteorological data including net radiation rn mj m2 air temperature t c relative humidity rh and precipitation p mm were hourly recorded at a nearby meteorological station wushan meteorological station about 2 km away from the experimental site vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa was calculated from t and rh using the equation described in campbell and norman 1998 as follows 1 vpd a exp b t t c 1 rh where a b and c are constants set to 0 611 17 502 and 240 97 respectively daily potential evapotranspiration pet is estimated following the hamon s method hamon 1963 federer and brook 1978 2 pet 0 1651 d vd where d is the time from sunrise to sunset in multiples of 12 h and was also obtained from the wushan meteorological station vd is the saturated vapor density g m 3 at the daily mean temperature tdaily and is calculated by the equation of vd 216 7 vs t 273 3 vs is the saturated vapor pressure mb and is calculated by vs 6 108 exp 17 26939 t t 237 3 once the estimated pet is obtained we can calculate the monthly and annual p pet dryness index federer and brook 1978 zhou et al 2015 soil water content swc was continuously monitored using three soil water probes sm300 delta t devices ltd cambridge uk that were buried at the depth of 30 cm beneath the soil surface 2 3 sap flow measurement total of twenty one sample trees of good health and different diameters at breast height dbh in the experimental plot were chosen as the sample trees for the sap flow measurements sample tree distribution was displayed in supplementary figure 1 according to an inventory survey within the experimental site we used lab made thermal dissipation probes tdps according to the prototype of granier s tdp to monitor the sap flux density a pair of tdp sensors were vertically 10 13 cm apart inserted into the xylem of sample trees at the breast height 1 3 above the ground and 2 cm deep on the north side of the stem the upper probe consisted of a copper constantan thermocouple and a heating element of constantan that was heated by a constant dc of 120 ma while the lower one remained unheated and served as a temperature reference the probes were covered by a plastic cover and an aluminum reflective foil to protect against mechanical disturbance radiation and rain the monitoring of sap flow was carried out from 2008 to 2021 detailed information for the sap flow measurement was described in ouyang et al 2020 and the sap flux density j s g h2o m 1 s 1 was calculated by the following equation granier 1987 3 j s 119 t m t t 1 231 where t m is the maximum temperature difference under zero flux conditions and t is the instantaneous temperature difference between the heated and the unheated probes the original voltage difference in proportion to the temperature difference between the two probes were read every 30 s and averaged every 10 min and recorded by a delta t data loggers dl2e delta t devices ltd cambridge uk and then converted to j s using baseliner 3 0 program 2 4 tree transpiration tree growth and water use efficiency we chose seven non sampled trees with different dbh within the plot and drilled wood cores using a borer of 5 mm in diameter the sapwood depths were directly measured from the cores by distinguishing the different colors between sapwood and heartwood the dbh and tree height h of sampled trees were annually hand measured the allometric equation between dbh and a s was established and used to calculate the sapwood area of the sampled trees we had performed a measurement to study the radial variation of sap flow of s superba the results at the same site showed that significant difference in j s in different sapwood depths was observed p 0 0001 the duncan test results showed that the j s of s superba was similar when sapwood depth is less than 4 cm but decreased to 45 of that at the most outer 0 2 cm depth when the sapwood depth was greater than 4 cm mei et al 2010 therefore in this study the whole tree transpiration was estimated by using the equation e j s 0 4 cm a s 0 4 cm 0 45 j s 0 4 cm a s 4 cm to remove the effect of tree size on whole tree transpiration we adopted a normalized tree transpiration et expressed as e dbh proposed by besson et al 2014 data missing is a common and inevitable problem when conducting a long term sap flow measurement due to probe or power failure to fill the missing data we firstly established the linear or exponential saturation regressions between the j s and the monitored photosynthetically active radiation par or vpd using the available data for every single tree within each month the j s and par readings were collected with 10 min resolution by the delta t data loggers at our own micro meteorological station on an observation tower within the stand and thus the sample size of the data is large enough to establish the linear or exponential regressions with significant regression relationships r2 0 5 p 0 05 secondly we calculated the missing j s values based on the established regression equations lastly the complete j s data can be scaled up to obtain the monthly and annual transpiration because of its smaller dependence on tree age the annual basal area increment bai cm2 year 1 is generally regarded as an indicator of tree growth battipaglia et al 2013 studies proposed that the bai can increase the accuracy in the climate response of tree growth ding et al 2021 mohr et al 2019 we calculated the bai as follows 4 bai π rn 2 rn 1 2 where r is the tree radius at breast height and n is the year since it is strictly forbidden to cut down any trees in the south china botanical garden the biomass of our sample trees was calculated by the allometric equation between tree biomass and dbh h established from a s superba stand of similar age in the heshan national field research station of forest ecosystem 22 41 n 112 54 e which is near guangzhou city and shares a similar climate and soil conditions specifically we fell down seven s superba trees of different dbh at the station measured the dbh tree height h and oven dried and weighed the leaf stem branch and root biomass of the felled trees then the allometric equations were established and listed as follows 5 above ground biomass 0 1521 dbh2 h 0 8068 n 7 r2 0 89 6 under ground biomass 0 0879 dbh2 h 0 6701 n 7 r2 0 91 therefore we can calculate the biomass of sampled trees every year based on their dbh and h water use efficiency wue was calculated as the ratio of the increment of whole tree biomass to the whole tree transpiration in every year δbiomass e 2 5 statistical analysis linear regressions were used to indicate the linear trends of mean annual temperature mat and wue as well as the relationships between monthly transpiration annual wue and environmental factors during the whole experimental period pearson correlation coefficients were calculated among the environmental factors including t rh p rn vpd swc and p pet we conducted a series of redundancy analyses rda according to a both side selection option to clarify the dominant drivers on tree transpiration growth and wue only the significant environmental variables identified in this process were included in subsequent analyses the collinearity between the environmental variables usually complicates the assessment of environment induced impacts on tree water use therefore the collinear factors will be classified into two groups namely heat group and water group to explore their combined effects according to the results of linear regression matrix specifically those parameters that refer to the energy such as net radiation and air temperature were classified as heat group while the relative humidity soil moisture and precipitation were regarded as water group wang et al 2011 then the variation partitioning was performed to obtain the partition variance of tree transpiration annual bai and annual wue we plotted the environmental factors et bai and wue by origin 18 0 all the statistical analysis and related figures were conducted using r version 3 5 3 r development core team 2018 and we denoted significant differences at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 environmental factors the values of t rh p rn vpd and swc in the wet season were generally higher than those in the dry season showing clear seasonal variations during the whole experimental period figs 1 and 2 the mat was between 22 0 and 24 0 c and the mean temperature ranged from 16 3 to 21 0 c in the dry season and from 26 6 to 28 5 c in the wet season respectively mean annual precipitation map ranged from 1472 mm 2011 to 2457 mm 2016 and the precipitation in the wet season accounted for more than 70 of the annual total the rn in dry season ranged from 3 62 to 4 99 mj m 2 but increased to the values between 6 22 and 8 87 mj m 2 in the wet season the largest and lowest averaged annual vpd occurred in 2009 and 2011 being 0 89 kpa and 0 64 kpa respectively similar temporal changes of swc were also observed resulting from the abundant rainfall swc reached the seasonal maximum of 28 35 during the wet months whereas the values dropped to about 20 during the dry months in terms of the annual dryness index p pet we found only the year 2009 and 2021 experienced a value of less than 1 indicating a potential drought because of uneven distribution of the precipitation in the whole year monthly p pet showed an obvious seasonal variation with potential drought mainly occurring in winter furthermore the mat during the period from 2008 2021 showed a significant increasing trend p 0 05 while the other parameters just fluctuated within a certain range fig 3 pearson correlation coefficients showed the collinear relationships among the environmental variables fig 4 the results indicated that t vpd and rn were highly correlated with each other p 0 001 similarly significant positive correlations were also presented among precipitation relative humidity and dryness index while the soil water content was mainly related to precipitation p 0 001 3 2 tree transpiration bai and wue seasonal changes in et from 2008 to 2021 were shown in fig 5 within every single year et gradually increased to a seasonal maximum during the wet season and then decreased due to unfavorable environmental conditions water light or heat availability and leaf senescence the greatest tree transpiration usually occurred in the summer and early autumn from june to october reaching values of more than 30 kg m 1 limited by the lower air temperature soil moisture and solar radiation et values were generally lower during the winter with values mainly ranging from 10 to 20 kg m 1 during the whole experimental period the lowest annual whole tree transpiration occurred in 2008 while trees in 2011 had the strongest transpiration and all the et values fluctuated between 200 and 310 kg m 1 fig 6a annual dbh h and bai experienced relatively significant increases throughout the experimental years fig 6b and c for example the values of annual bai were less than 30 cm2 year 1 at the early stage while the increment values reached more than 30 cm2 year 1 during the recent 2 years due to the relatively stable tree transpiration and the increase in the biomass increment annual wue also significantly increased over the years fig 6d p 0 05 results showed that the minimum wue occurred in 2008 with values of 2 25 0 57 g biomass kg h2o while the wue values have increased to 4 73 0 81 in 2017 and 4 67 0 56 g biomass kg h2o in 2021 respectively 3 3 relationships of et bai and wue with environmental factors we established the linear relationships between monthly et and all environmental factors fig 7 results indicated significant positive correlations between monthly et and air temperature vpd rn and swc with the r 2 values ranging from 0 13 to 0 54 p 0 05 nevertheless the linear relationships between transpiration and other factors including precipitation relative humidity dryness index were not significant data not shown differing from monthly transpiration annual bai only presented significant linear correlations with air temperature and swc in the dry season fig 8 p 0 05 with smaller variations in annual vpd and rn linear relationships were not significant between these factors and bai in addition on the larger time scale the linear regression relationships between annual wue and most monitored environmental factors were not significant only annual mean air temperature and averaged swc in the dry season showed significantly positive linear relationships with annual wue with r 2 values between 0 34 and 0 59 fig 9 p 0 05 3 4 variation partitioning analyses on et bai and wue redundancy analysis rda results showed that the t and rh were the main factors significantly affecting monthly transpiration annual bai and wue p 0 05 according to the strong correlations of environmental variables shown in fig 4 we classified t and rn as heat group and rh p and swc as water group as presented in fig 10 when the variance of monthly transpiration was decomposed the heat t and rn and the water rh p and swc variables accounted for an average variance of 50 and 9 respectively the shared effects of heat and water groups were 6 on the variance of et and the amount of variation captured by all of the selected explanatory variables was collectively 65 since vpd and p pet were calculated from the aforementioned factors their effects were separately listed benefiting from the combination of t and rh the explanation of vpd for et was relatively high with a value being 52 while p pet had weak individual effects and only explained 2 of the variation for monthly transpiration in addition the heat and water groups explained 24 and 7 of the variance of annual bai respectively while vpd and p pet just showed weak explanations similar to the effect on et the heat variables still ranked as the greatest ones in influencing annual wue with a contribution rate of 46 whereas the water group had a weak individual effects 1 on annual wue and no shared effects were observed moreover the proportions of variances of vpd and p pet for wue accounted for only 6 fig 10 4 discussion in this study the seasonal variation of transpiration could be attributed to the changing climatic and swc conditions which was supported by the established linear relationships between et and the related factors fig 7 under higher air temperature more sufficient solar radiation and sufficient soil water supply trees generally transpired more water in the wet and the early stage of dry season which in accordance with many previous studies obojes et al 2018 ouyang et al 2022b differing from our hypothesis the water related factors such as precipitation rarely exerted significant explanation on tree monthly et from 2008 to 2021 implying no water limitation on s superba plantations in this region moreover the variation partitioning analysis highlighted the importance of heat factor such as air temperature and net radiation rather than the water factors on tree monthly transpiration a similar result reported that these two variables were the potential important predictors for the daily transpiration of tested tree species in beijing in north china wang et al 2011 also several studies have indicated that evapotranspiration was mainly driven by radiation in humid regions jiang et al 2022 aguilos et al 2019 the most reliable explanation for our results could be attributed to the regional climatic characteristics on one hand water is the main limiting factor for forests in semi arid and arid areas reduced precipitation and decreased soil moisture generally resulted in less transpiration grossiord et al 2018 wang et al 2017 pangle et al 2015 however in our study the abundant precipitation total annual precipitation ranging from 1400 mm to 2300 mm keeps the swc values around 20 even in dry seasons which were still higher than those of arid areas on the other hand our previous study showed that s superba trees have roots as deep as 50 60 cm and were proved to be able to take advantage of deeper soil moisture 40 60 cm under dry conditions according to the estimated xylem water δ 18o values ouyang et al 2020 therefore the plenty of rainfall and the ability to utilize deep soil water make the water related factors less crucial and thus highlight the role of the heat factors a remarkable result in our study is that the tree bai positively and negatively responded to the mat and swc respectively p 0 05 the heat and water groups accounted for 19 shared effects on the variance of bai suggesting a combined effect of water and heat both positive and negative effects of air temperature on tree growth have also been reported jia et al 2022 dixit et al 2022 chen et al 2022 fu et al 2020 for instance air temperature is the main limiting factor for tree growth in permafrost regions zhang et al 2016 mcmahon et al 2010 and thus an extension of the growing season caused by the increase in temperature can facilitate tree growth oishi et al 2018 jia et al 2015 also proposed that a warmer climate accompanied by less water stress at the end of the growing season can benefit carbon storage for the following growing season in our case with abundant rainfall and the above mentioned ability to utilize deep soil water a higher temperature can promote s superba trees to capture carbon resources for biomass increment even in the autumn and winter and the carbon storage might facilitate the formation of the earlywood in the next year litton et al 2007 the sufficient radiation in the autumn is also conducive to the wood growth of trees which was confirmed by a dendroecological study in the same area of this research li et al 2020 the relatively favorable environment finally leads to the positive effect of air temperature on the tree growth of s superba however the negative relationship between bai and swc was unexpected and a similar result was observed by xie et al 2016 who reported a negative relationship between precipitation and gross ecosystem production in spring also zuidema et al 2022 conducted a pantropical tree ring network research and found a weak negative response of tree growth to precipitation occurring at sites with relatively high water availability research has proposed that the negative response may reflect radiation limitation of photosynthesis as the radiation limitation is thought to occur when map 2000 mm wagner et al 2016 in other words frequent cloudy and rainy weather reduced the stomatal opening and therefore decreased the co2 uptake despite the unexpected result we tend to think that it was the mat not the swc dominated the change in bai such effect of swc on annual bai is likely to be overestimated due to the reason of scale effect i e annual growth and was supported by the fact that only 1 of the variation on bai explained by water factors unlike the previous studies which reported the decoupled relationship between bai and wue giguere croteau et al 2019 lévesque et al 2014 we found that both bai and wue experienced an increasing trend throughout the experimental period researchers attributed the decoupling of bai with wue to the more vulnerable xylem conduits and the unsustainable growth resulting from the low carbon assimilation rate zadworny et al 2019 as well as the inaccessibility of deep water under water limited conditions jia et al 2022 however such conditions hardly occurred in our study as shown in fig 5 the transpiration of s superba remained relatively vigorous especially in the recent three years 2018 2021 even in the dry season meanwhile proved by the values of swc and the previously measured root depth the s superba was less likely to suffer from a severe drought compared with those species of other studies as a result s superba was able to maintain relatively stable transpiration promote the increase of wue and ultimately improve its growth even under the condition of dry season fig 6 similar to the bai annual tree wue was positively correlated with the mat but negatively correlated with swc in the dry season fig 9 confirming the viewpoint stressing the role of dry season climate variability in driving the trade off between tree water use and growth zuidema et al 2022 it is widely accepted that decreased soil water can lead to tight stomatal control and limited transpiration rates fu et al 2020 trees are prone to improve the wue to cope with the potential drought when soil water supply decreases while the increase of mat increased biomass as previously discussed and consequently led to higher wue values under such conditions urrutia jalabert et al 2015 the responses of tree growth and transpiration to environmental variables over a long term determined the variations in wue and the heat factors also showed a relatively stronger explanation for the wue compared with the water factors fig 10 therefore we proposed that in rainy south china air temperature and solar radiation that explained more variance variability in et played more important roles in regulating the tree s water use efficiency climate changes have induced a warmer atmosphere and obvious changes in rainfall patterns the observed correlations between climate and typical tree species growth at a given climatic zone are often used to estimate tree health and growth in the future charney et al 2016 whether the potential benefits of high wue can offset the negative impacts of climate change remains uncertain friedlingstein et al 2013 this study provided 14 years of monitored data about the water transpiration and growth of the native s superba trees and the responses to the climate factors and soil water content differing from our hypothesis the results emphasized the importance of heat factors especially air temperature to tree water use growth and wue and possible reasons were due to the climate condition in south china and the water use strategy of s superba in addition the increasing trend of bai indicated the s superba is still in a good situation under current climatic conditions as proposed that trees bai trend would not decrease unless trees begin to senesce duchesne et al 2003 jia et al 2022 owing to the relatively deeper root depth and the sufficient soil water supply in south china we can expect that s superba could have an advantage in maintaining its growth when facing the possibly prolonged drought and small increases in atmospheric temperature in the future further research should focus on the sensitivity of the functional traits especially those related to photosynthesis and water use efficiency of typical tree species to the climatic and environmental drivers bauman et al 2022 5 conclusion our study investigated the sap flow based transpiration tree growth and water use efficiency of the native s superba plantation during the period from 2008 to 2021 in subtropical south china the annual transpiration was vigorous and fluctuated while the bai and wue showed a significant increase trend during the whole period the temporal change of monthly et has been affected by a variety of environmental factors such as air temperature rn vpd and swc the annual bai and wue presented significant linear regressions with mat and swc in the dry season we have demonstrated the significant effects of t and rh on et bai and wue and divided the environmental factors into two groups heat group and water group based on their pearson correlations the variation partitioning analysis indicated that the heat factors including air temperature and solar radiation explained larger variations of et bai and wue than the water factors whereas the vpd and dryness index rarely influence the bai and wue therefore our results suggested that it was the heat factors especially air temperature rather than the water factors that regulate the tree transpiration growth and wue of s superba additionally due to the advantages in obtaining deeper soil water the s superba trees can deal with the current climate conditions such as uneven distribution of rainfall to maintain their growth the climate responses of the typical subtropical tree growth and wue elucidated from this study can enhance
