12570,although powdered photocatalysts has shown high degradation efficiency in photocatalytic reactions their practical applications are limited by the poor recovery of powder to improve its recycling performance a three dimensional layered photocatalytic fiber membrane was newly designed through electrospinning and coating process the composition of the photocatalytic membrane was polyacrylonitrile pan polydopamine pda and tb doping graphitized carbon nitride znin2s4 tb g c3n4 znin2s4 from bottom to top the photocatalytic performance of the prepared composite membranes was investigated under simulating sunlight compared to the prepared pan tb g c3n4 pt pan pda tb g c3n4 ppt and monolithic pan pda tb g c3n4 znin2s4 pptz the pptz displayed the highest photocatalytic ability the degradation rates of pptz for tylosin tyl and tetracycline tc were approximately 2 1 and 2 5 times than that of other samples the superior photocatalytic activity of the pptz sample resulted from the formation of a heterostructure among tb g c3n4 znin2s4 and pda which significantly inhibited the recombination of photogenerated carriers pda could act as an electron transfer medium so that electrons were transferred from the tb g c3n4 to the znin2s4 and pda which could be found in the study of its electron density with density functional theory dft according to the free radical trapping analysis the order of importance of the redox species was o2 h oh moreover the toxicity of the material was investigated to ensure that the material would not cause secondary pollution in practical applications keywords photocatalysis antibiotics g c3n4 pda znin2s4 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the modern era the emergence and widespread of antibiotic resistance has been one of the most common threats to humans and animals 1 2 tetracycline antibiotics tc and tylosin tyl are the popular antibiotic classes due to their good antibacterial activity high quality and low cost 3 5 they have been widely used to treat bacterial infections on human poultry and fish farms to combat disease improve feed efficiency and increase the growth rate of livestock 6 however 50 80 of those antibiotics are excreted into the environment as unmetabolised compounds via sewage treatment plants or livestock manure due to its biometabolic characteristics 7 in recent years there has been widespread concern about water pollution due to the discharge of antibiotic residues into the aquatic environment with antibiotic effluent not only threatening the safety of aquatic ecosystems but also causing waste of water resources 2 the complete removal of antibiotics with low concentration from water is therefore of great importance in the reports powdered photocatalyst is a very efficient photocatalyst for aqueous decomposition and pollutant degradation due to its good dispersion high stability and large surface area 8 9 for example in our previous study 3 we prepared powdered tb doped mesoporous g c3n4 photocatalytic materials and found that tb g c3n4 degraded tc and tyl at 90 within 90 min however the performance of traditional discrete powder photocatalysts has a fatal flaw which generates a relatively low secondary utilisation rate and is prone to secondary nanomaterial contamination improving its recycling rate and safety has therefore become a research priority as a new and highly efficient environmental purification technology membrane technology is low cost energy efficient and easy to operate which has been applied extensively in areas such as water quality management ecological restoration wastewater treatment rare metal recovery and the adsorption and degradation of dyes 10 in particular membrane purification has the advantages of being recyclable and pollution free processing which is a promising technology for photocatalytic degradation by combining the nanocatalyst with a porous membrane as a substrate it was reported that the catalyst recovery has been improved for example a novel pvdf tio2 g c3n4 composite electrostatic spun fiber was prepared by zheng et al which could effectively photocatalytically degrade tetracycline under visible light irradiation 11 li et al prepared antibacterial z type znin2s4 ag2moo4 composite photocatalytic nanofibers to improve the photocatalytic degradation of enrofloxacin and it had good reusability 12 tio2 carbon flexible fibres were synthesized by electrospinning technology and hydrothermal synthesis 13 however the electrostatic spinning fiber membranes doped with photocatalysts were usually prepared in the process where the catalyst was dispersed and the amount of catalyst contained in the fiber membrane per unit area was low moreover the catalytic activity of the encapsulated nanocatalysts was significantly reduced through physical mixture of the composite materials resulting in low photocatalytic efficiency compared with the electrostatic spinning spraying method coating method can coat the photocatalyst particles on the membrane surface which can fully contact with the pollutants and have better photocatalytic performance for instance zeng et al prepared g c3n4 mxene pes cn mx 2d 2d composite membranes by vacuum filtration which were able to photocatalytically degrade dyes as well as tetracyclines in water 14 liu et al prepared dynamic photocatalytic membranes by depositing znin2s4 on the surface of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane by terminal filtration method which showed good removal of fluvastatin from water 15 however it also has the drawback that the coating can be easily peeled off on the surface which will inhibit the recycling efficiency of the photocatalyst therefore it is very important to develop a method to make sure the coating will not shed off easily according to the reports polydopamine pda has good absorption of visible uv and nir light 16 importantly pda is adherent and can adhere to the surface of different inorganic organic or biological materials therefore it will be a better viscous material to reduce the shedding of photocatalytic materials in addition as a derivative of catechol it contains a large number of catechol structural groups which can generate semi quinone and brew structures under neutral and basic conditions thus pda is able to receive electrons from electron giving donors by polymerization of dopamine on a photocatalyst the π π conjugate structure of g c3n4 and the π π electron delocalization of pda can create synergistic effects which can enhance charge carrier transfer when the catalyst is excited by light to produce electron holes a part of the electrons will be transferred to the pda thereby inhibiting the binding of electron holes in this way pda as an artificially designed and synthesized photocatalytic system is able to effectively transfer and separate photoexcited electrons to form a built in electric field the recombination of photogenerated electron holes is reduced thereby improving the photocatalytic activity 4 5 17 in summary given that traditional photocatalytic powders are difficult to recycle and easy to cause secondary pollution the main purpose of this paper is to investigate an efficient photocatalytic membrane but during the preparation of the membrane it was found that the photocatalyst coated by the surface deposition method was easy to fall off therefore pda was selected to bond membrane and photocatalysts together in order to improve the adhesion in this study the pan pda tb g c3n4 znin2s4 pptz photocatalytic membrane with a three dimensional layered structure was prepared by a four step synthesis method photocatalytic activity was studied by simulating the photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline and tylosin under solar radiation the structure of pptz was first optimised using density functional theory dft followed by a study of its electron density finally the possible mechanism for improving the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the photocatalytic films was proposed 2 experimental section 2 1 experimental drugs melamine analytically pure tb no3 3 5h2o 99 99

cache solution ph 7 5 and then 200 mg of dopamine hydrochloride was added and stirred for 24 h the films were then put in an oven at 60 c for 2 h the resulting samples were labelled as ppt the photocatalytic membrane was prepared by depositing znin2s4 on the surface of the ppt membrane through dead end filtration a certain amount of the prepared znin2s4 was dispersed in deionized water to form a suspension liquid the liquid was then shifted to a terminal filter cup with a ppt membrane under the cup and then vacuum filtered under pressure znin2s4 was equably deposited on the surface of the ppt membrane then dried at 60 c for 2 h the membrane was noted as pptz the synthetic path of the material is shown in fig 1 2 3 characterisation microscopic characterisation of the samples surface

photogenerated carrier separation efficiency characterisation 2 4 dft calculation first principles calculations used vasp the generalised gradient approximation gga was used to describe the exchange correlation interactions in the form of a perdew burke ernzerhof pbe function the gga pbe approach is an effective method for surface study the simulations were set to ivdw 11 the weak dispersion and van der waals forces were considered using grimme s dft d3 method with a plane wave cut off energy value of 400 ev a vacuum layer of 15 å in the z direction was set to minimise the inter layer interaction between adjacent layers the brillouin zone was described using a 9 9 1 monkhorst pack k point grid the structure was optimised to a hellmann feynman force of 0 01 ev å 1 per atom and a total energy change of 10 5 ev until all atoms relaxed completely 2 5 photocatalytic experiment the photocatalytic activity was studied for catalysts with tyl and tc as targeted pollutants during the experiments of simulating solar irradiation the distance from the photocatalytic reactor to the lamp 170 w xenon lamp full wavelength was held at 2 cm the pptz membrane sample was added to 60 ml of tyl solution 25 mg l or tc 25 mg l darkroom adsorption equilibration lasted for 30 min prior to photocatalysis the mixture was then subjected to continuous aeration stirring 0 75 l min with the light on the sample solutions at different time periods were centrifuged for 5 min the absorbance of tyl and tc in the sampling solution was measured by uv spectrophotometer and then the concentration of the antibiotic was calculated from the absorbance the limits of detection for tc and tyl absorbance in absorbance determination were 0 4 mg l and 0 51 mg l to ensure reproducible antibiotic removal of the pptz membranes five cycles of antibiotic degradation were performed after each experimental cycle the films were repeatedly cleaned four times with deionized water and absolute ethanol and then placed in the oven to dry for the next experiments 2 6 toxicity test the catalyst was added to deionized water and stirred for 8 h the supernatant was taken for centrifugation subsequently 20 full grained uniformly sized seeds of brassica juncea were chosen and put in filter paper petri dishes to which 5 ml of supernatant was added and the petri dishes were placed in an incubator at 25 c for 3 days seeds cultured in deionized water were used as a blank control group and three parallel experiments were performed for each percolate the calculation formula of seed germination index sgi is as follows 3 1 sgi average germination rate lc average root length lc average germination rate dw average root length dw 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 structure and composition ftir measurements were used to verify the crystal structures of xpt x 100 150 and 200 pan ppt and pptz catalysts it can be seen from fig 2 that a strong band region was displayed at 1200 1650 cm 1 which was characteristic of aromatic cn heterocycles the absorption band at 1640 cm 1 was caused by cn stretching and the other three bands at 1558 cm 1 1458 cm 1 and 1398 cm 1 were typical of the stretching vibrational modes typical of cn heterocycles 18 20 the two bands at about 1317 cm 1 and 1249 cm 1 were associated with cnhc partially condensed or n c 3 fully condensed stretching vibrations of the connecting unit a characteristic vibration of the triazine ring at 815 cm 1 was also observed 21 the pptz sample revealed a similar structure further demonstrating the presence of tcn in the catalysts moreover two peaks at 1384 and 1631 cm 1 belonged to surface absorbing acid molecules indicating the presence of hydroxyl groups in znin2s4 which were also present in the pptz nanocomposites 22 these results indicate that the synthesis was successful for pptz nanocomposites the bands at 1506 and 1618 cm 1 were the tensile vibrations of the pda structure 23 fig 3 shows the xrd patterns of xpt x 100 150 and 200 pan ppt and pptz as can be seen from the figure the intensity of 200pt peaks between 27 6 and 32 5 was significantly higher than that of 100pt and 150pt there were two main reasons for the higher xrd peaks intensity of 200pt a peak intensity increased due to a large amount of doped tcn b in the spinning process the tcn cannot been controlled to spray evenly resulting in high tcn content in some parts it can also been observed from the sem figure that nodules will occur in some places on the spinning membrane the pan membrane had a distinct strong diffraction peak at 17 4 24 however there was no obvious characteristic peak at 17 4 in the pptz the reason may be that the percentage of pan in the pptz composite becomes smaller which causes the characteristic peak to be inconspicuous the diffraction peak was characteristic of the mellon compound and had an index of 100 for the pptz nanocomposite a characteristic diffraction peak at 27 6 overlaps with the reflection peak 002 of g c3n4 27 5 and the reflection peak 102 of hexagonal znin2s4 jcpds no 65 2023 25 from the fig 4b the doping of tcn in pan could be clearly seen in the spun fibres with embedded tcn particles the diameter of which was around 20 nm fig 4f from the fig 4c a large number of microspheric pda were found to be polymerised on the spun fiber membrane and marigold like zis were found closely attached to the pda with the diameter of 3 5 μm on fig 4d it was also clear from the tem images that the pda and zis were tightly attached to the fibres fig 4e f it can also be seen that the diameter of the membrane fibres was approximately 7 nm the successful synthesis of multifaceted photocatalytic films can be observed visually moreover the two dimensional and three dimensional images of the dynamic photocatalytic membrane are shown in fig 4 g h respectively it can be found that the roughness of the membrane was 41 2 nm the fig 5 shows the xps energy spectra of six elements c n zn in s and tb in the 150tcn zis catalyst as can be seen from the fig 5a the spectra of c1s at 283 6 ev and 287 5 ev were corresponding to the sp2 hybridised cc and ncn respectively 4 5 which originated from coupled g c3n4 in fig 5b the high resolution spectra of n1s are located at 398 7 ev 399 4 ev and 400 9 ev the peaks at 398 7 ev and 399 9 ev are sp2 hybrid n attributing to n on nc bond and n c 3 bond 3 the zn 2p spectrum had two peaks at 1044 8 ev and 1021 7 ev which belonged to zn 2p1 2 and zn 2p3 2 respectively the peaks binding energy of the in 3d spectrum at 445 0 ev and 452 6 ev belonged to in 3d5 2 and in 3d3 2 respectively the peaks of the s 2p spectrum at 161 6 ev and 162 7 ev belonged to s the binding energy values are consistent with those reported in the previous literature so the valence states of zn s and in can be determined as 2 2 and 3 respectively 15 22 26 the peak around 161 7 ev in the figure belonged to tb 4d5 2 it is proved that the doped tb existed in the form of tb iii 27 the absorbance properties of the samples were determined by a uv vis spectrophotometer fig 6 the absorption edge of pure pt could be obtained from the graph at about 460 nm in contrast the light absorption edge of pptz was shifted to 580 nm fig 6a which may be due to the existence of a heterojunction among pda zis and g c3n4 the forbidden band width eg of the catalyst was calculated by the kubelka munk function αhv a hv eg n 2 5 the diagram plots a tangent line with hv and αhv 1 2 as the horizontal coordinates and the intersection of the tangent line and the horizontal coordinates was the bandgap energy the band gap energy of the pptz sample was 1 86 ev which was lower than the band gap of pt as shown in the fig 6b generally speaking the higher the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes the higher the fluorescence intensity in order to study the migration and separation of photogenerated electrons and holes in the pptz sample pl characterizations of pt and pptz samples were determined at 300 nm excitation wavelength and shown in fig 6c the fig 6c showed that there was a strong emission peak at 452 nm for pt which implied a high recombination rate of the photogenerated carriers there was almost no emission peak for ppt and pptz and the comparison of photoluminescence intensity was pt pptz suggesting that the separation of photogenerated e and h for pptz was significantly better than that of pt which is due to photocatalysts forming heterojunctions with pda and zis this can be explained by the electron transfer function of pda which was caused by an extended π conjugated system with abundant semi quinone and quinone groups 17 hence the construction of pptz can enhance the light absorption and reduce the e h recombination so that the pptz membrane has high photocatalytic activity 3 2 dft calculation the structure of the pptz monolayer was investigated and the geometry of the heterojunction was shown in fig 7a b after structural optimisation the optimum interfacial layer distances d1 and d2 in the vertical direction were calculated to be respectively 2 99 å and 2 49 å in the pptz system such large interfacial distances showed that tcn was interacting with zis and pda through weak van der waals vdws forces rather than forming covalent interactions furthermore in addition to the equilibrium distance between the interfaces the interfacial geometry of the heterojunction also demonstrates the strength of the interfacial interactions as shown in the fig 7c the three dimensional differential charge density was calculated from this it can be seen that electrons were transferred from the tcn to the zis and pda thus introducing the built in electric field which acted as a driving force to separate the photogenerated carriers 8 9 3 3 photocatalytic activity in order to determine the optimum dosage of tcn doped pan spun films and the performance of pptz films for photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics the experiments were carried out to study tc and tyl degradation by different catalysts under simulating sunlight the fig 8a b showed the degradation curves of tc and tyl photocatalyzed by 50pt 100pt 150pt ppt and pptz respectively in the absence of a catalyst there is little degradation of tc and tyl 100pt displayed the optimum photocatalytic performance during the xpt samples after 90 min of simulated solar irradiation indicating that 100 mg of tcn was the optimum addition into pan film as expected the pptz nanocomposites showed higher photocatalytic degradation rates pptz degraded tc and tyl with 80 and 82 efficiency respectively much higher than pt and ppt in order to intuitively compare the photocatalytic activity of the films the results of the photocatalytic degradation were subjected to a quasi level kinetic study with the following equations ln c c 0 kt where c was the concentration of tyl and tc at irradiation time t min c0 was the initial concentration of tyl and tc and k represents the apparent reaction rate constant from fig 8c d it can be found that the reaction rate constants k of pptz degradation of tc and tyl are 2 2 and 1 6 times that of pt there are two possible reasons for this effect firstly zis and tcn formed a heterojunction because the forbidden band width of zis was smaller which could generate more photogenerated electrons and the electron hole complexation rate was reduced by electron transfer secondly pda could act as an electron transfer medium to reduce electron hole recombination the main reaction mechanism will be detailed in subsection 3 5 3 4 photocatalytic reaction mechanism the general principle of photocatalysis is that light excites the photocatalytic material to produce electrons and holes in the aqueous phase which then produce oxide species such as o2 and oh therefore the discovery of the main oxide species generated in the degradation reaction is essential to explain the mechanism of the photocatalytic reaction by adding different trapping agents to neutralize free radicals the main oxide species involved in the degradation process during catalysis were identified isopropanol ipa ammonium oxalate ao and benzoquinone bq are commonly utilized as trapping agents for oh h and o2 respectively 5 as shown in fig 9 the degradation rate of tc varies were 71 7 35 7 67 and 65 4 with the addition of bq ipa and ao respectively from the results of the radical capture experiments when bq was added during the degradation process it had the greatest inhibitory effect on the photocatalytic membrane degradation of tc followed by ao thus it was concluded from the experimental results that o2 was the most important active species the addition of ao ipa also inhibited the degradation effect to some extent indicating that oh and h were also involved in the reaction during the photocatalytic degradation of tc the order of importance of the redox species was o2 h oh therefore o2 and h played the most important role in the whole degradation process according to the above experimental findings and the characterisation results the photocatalytic reaction mechanism for degradation of antibiotics with pptz nanocomposite films was proposed theoretically the conduction band cb of g c3n4 is 1 1 ev and valence band vb is 1 6 ev 3 the cb and vb of zis are 0 41 ev and 1 45 ev 28 when the material is excited by light electrons leap from vb to cb due to the potential difference between zis and tcn the part of the electrons in the tcn cb pass through the tightly connected interface and then migrate rapidly into the zis cb other part of the electrons leap to the tb iii impurity energy level and pda compared to traditional binary heterojunctions pptz reduced the recombination of electrons and holes during photocatalysis during the photocatalytic reaction the electrons are excited by light to transition from vb to cb then the h is left on the vb which is oxidizing and can directly oxidize antibiotics to achieve the purpose of removing them the electrons enriched on the zis cb can reduce the catalyst surface o2 to o2 which also contribute to oxidizing the organic pollutant this is due to the fact that the reduction potential of photogenerated e of the pptz is lower than o2 o2 0 33 ev 29 as can be seen from fig 10 the addition of hydroxyl radical scavengers will also have some effects on photocatalytic performance the main reason for this result is that the redox potentials of oh oh and oh h2o was determined to be 1 99 ev and 2 27 ev this is higher than the highest potential of cn and zis occupying molecular orbitals so h in vb can t oxidize h2o or oh to produce oh it can be concluded from this that oh should be made up of o2 generated therefore when hydroxyl radical scavengers are added the photocatalytic performance will be reduced 30 31 the photogenerated e h are effectively separated during the whole reaction process and the active substances h and o2 generated by the photoreaction will carry out redox reactions with antibiotics at the same time pda as a photosensitiser could effectively promote the light absorption capacity and generate more carriers in the catalytic system to participate in the photocatalytic reaction not only that but pda also acted as an interfacial medium connecting the heterojunction to the thin membrane and could facilitate efficient transport of carriers across the heterojunction interface there was also the doping of the catalyst with trace amounts of rare earth trivalent cations tb3 which can play a role in trapping electron effectively trapping electrons located on vb and restoring them to tb2 in conclusion the pptz photocatalytic nanofiber films allow more e and h to participate in photocatalytic reactions and then have better photocatalytic performance 3 5 stability of pptz photocatalytic films the stability of pptz photocatalytic films was determined by three cycles of degradation tyl experiments it can be seen from fig 11 that the efficiency of tyl degradation in pptz samples still remained around 75 indicating that the pptz films have good stability in practical applications 3 6 toxicity experiments in order to test the toxicity of the photocatalysts the average root length al and germination rate of seeds sr of bok choy seeds were obtained from seed germination tests and the seed germination index sgi was derived from eq 1 the fig 12 shows the germination photos with different catalysts leachates as culture solutions the al sr and sgi of bok choy seeds in the germination experiment are shown in table 1 as can be seen from table 1 the sgi of cabbage seeds cultured in the leachate of all photocatalytic materials did not differ significantly indicating that the pptz photocatalytic membrane leachate didn t affect the seed germination process 4 conclusions in this study tb g c3n4 znin2s4 photocatalysts were deposited on the surface of pan nanofibre films with pda as an intermediate linker to obtain fibrous films with photocatalytic properties through a multi step preparation process the membrane surface gradually formed a uniform and dense multilayer structure film and the surface morphology formed an undulating mountain like structure the membrane showed excellent degradation of tc and tyl with 80 and 82 4 removal rates for these two antibiotics respectively in addition the cyclic removal results of tyl showed that the nanofiber photocatalytic membrane had excellent photocatalytic performance and stability and after three cycles of experiments the photocatalytic membrane could still reach about 74 removal rate of tyl these results suggested that the preparation of nanophotocatalytic membranes by electrospinning and coating process was a viable way to address antibiotic contamination the prepared membrane improved the recyclability of photocatalytic materials and had lower toxicity which offers the possibility of favourable development for photocatalysis and degradation of antibiotics declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12570,although powdered photocatalysts has shown high degradation efficiency in photocatalytic reactions their practical applications are limited by the poor recovery of powder to improve its recycling performance a three dimensional layered photocatalytic fiber membrane was newly designed through electrospinning and coating process the composition of the photocatalytic membrane was polyacrylonitrile pan polydopamine pda and tb doping graphitized carbon nitride znin2s4 tb g c3n4 znin2s4 from bottom to top the photocatalytic performance of the prepared composite membranes was investigated under simulating sunlight compared to the prepared pan tb g c3n4 pt pan pda tb g c3n4 ppt and monolithic pan pda tb g c3n4 znin2s4 pptz the pptz displayed the highest photocatalytic ability the degradation rates of pptz for tylosin tyl and tetracycline tc were approximately 2 1 and 2 5 times than that of other samples the superior photocatalytic activity of the pptz sample resulted from the formation of a heterostructure among tb g c3n4 znin2s4 and pda which significantly inhibited the recombination of photogenerated carriers pda could act as an electron transfer medium so that electrons were transferred from the tb g c3n4 to the znin2s4 and pda which could be found in the study of its electron density with density functional theory dft according to the free radical trapping analysis the order of importance of the redox species was o2 h oh moreover the toxicity of the material was investigated to ensure that the material would not cause secondary pollution in practical applications keywords photocatalysis antibiotics g c3n4 pda znin2s4 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the modern era the emergence and widespread of antibiotic resistance has been one of the most common threats to humans and animals 1 2 tetracycline antibiotics tc and tylosin tyl are the popular antibiotic classes due to their good antibacterial activity high quality and low cost 3 5 they have been widely used to treat bacterial infections on human poultry and fish farms to combat disease improve feed efficiency and increase the growth rate of livestock 6 however 50 80 of those antibiotics are excreted into the environment as unmetabolised compounds via sewage treatment plants or livestock manure due to its biometabolic characteristics 7 in recent years there has been widespread concern about water pollution due to the discharge of antibiotic residues into the aquatic environment with antibiotic effluent not only threatening the safety of aquatic ecosystems but also causing waste of water resources 2 the complete removal of antibiotics with low concentration from water is therefore of great importance in the reports powdered photocatalyst is a very efficient photocatalyst for aqueous decomposition and pollutant degradation due to its good dispersion high stability and large surface area 8 9 for example in our previous study 3 we prepared powdered tb doped mesoporous g c3n4 photocatalytic materials and found that tb g c3n4 degraded tc and tyl at 90 within 90 min however the performance of traditional discrete powder photocatalysts has a fatal flaw which generates a relatively low secondary utilisation rate and is prone to secondary nanomaterial contamination improving its recycling rate and safety has therefore become a research priority as a new and highly efficient environmental purification technology membrane technology is low cost energy efficient and easy to operate which has been applied extensively in areas such as water quality management ecological restoration wastewater treatment rare metal recovery and the adsorption and degradation of dyes 10 in particular membrane purification has the advantages of being recyclable and pollution free processing which is a promising technology for photocatalytic degradation by combining the nanocatalyst with a porous membrane as a substrate it was reported that the catalyst recovery has been improved for example a novel pvdf tio2 g c3n4 composite electrostatic spun fiber was prepared by zheng et al which could effectively photocatalytically degrade tetracycline under visible light irradiation 11 li et al prepared antibacterial z type znin2s4 ag2moo4 composite photocatalytic nanofibers to improve the photocatalytic degradation of enrofloxacin and it had good reusability 12 tio2 carbon flexible fibres were synthesized by electrospinning technology and hydrothermal synthesis 13 however the electrostatic spinning fiber membranes doped with photocatalysts were usually prepared in the process where the catalyst was dispersed and the amount of catalyst contained in the fiber membrane per unit area was low moreover the catalytic activity of the encapsulated nanocatalysts was significantly reduced through physical mixture of the composite materials resulting in low photocatalytic efficiency compared with the electrostatic spinning spraying method coating method can coat the photocatalyst particles on the membrane surface which can fully contact with the pollutants and have better photocatalytic performance for instance zeng et al prepared g c3n4 mxene pes cn mx 2d 2d composite membranes by vacuum filtration which were able to photocatalytically degrade dyes as well as tetracyclines in water 14 liu et al prepared dynamic photocatalytic membranes by depositing znin2s4 on the surface of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane by terminal filtration method which showed good removal of fluvastatin from water 15 however it also has the drawback that the coating can be easily peeled off on the surface which will inhibit the recycling efficiency of the photocatalyst therefore it is very important to develop a method to make sure the coating will not shed off easily according to the reports polydopamine pda has good absorption of visible uv and nir light 16 importantly pda is adherent and can adhere to the surface of different inorganic organic or biological materials therefore it will be a better viscous material to reduce the shedding of photocatalytic materials in addition as a derivative of catechol it contains a large number of catechol structural groups which can generate semi quinone and brew structures under neutral and basic conditions thus pda is able to receive electrons from electron giving donors by polymerization of dopamine on a photocatalyst the π π conjugate structure of g c3n4 and the π π electron delocalization of pda can create synergistic effects which can enhance charge carrier transfer when the catalyst is excited by light to produce electron holes a part of the electrons will be transferred to the pda thereby inhibiting the binding of electron holes in this way pda as an artificially designed and synthesized photocatalytic system is able to effectively transfer and separate photoexcited electrons to form a built in electric field the recombination of photogenerated electron holes is reduced thereby improving the photocatalytic activity 4 5 17 in summary given that traditional photocatalytic powders are difficult to recycle and easy to cause secondary pollution the main purpose of this paper is to investigate an efficient photocatalytic membrane but during the preparation of the membrane it was found that the photocatalyst coated by the surface deposition method was easy to fall off therefore pda was selected to bond membrane and photocatalysts together in order to improve the adhesion in this study the pan pda tb g c3n4 znin2s4 pptz photocatalytic membrane with a three dimensional layered structure was prepared by a four step synthesis method photocatalytic activity was studied by simulating the photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline and tylosin under solar radiation the structure of pptz was first optimised using density functional theory dft followed by a study of its electron density finally the possible mechanism for improving the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the photocatalytic films was proposed 2 experimental section 2 1 experimental drugs melamine analytically pure tb no3 3 5h2o 99 99

form a suspension liquid the liquid was then shifted to a terminal filter cup with a ppt membrane under the cup and then vacuum filtered under pressure znin2s4 was equably deposited on the surface of

correlation interactions in the form of a perdew burke ernzerhof pbe function the gga pbe approach is an effective method for surface study the simulations were set to ivdw 11 the weak dispersion and

total energy change of 10 5 ev until all atoms relaxed completely 2 5 photocatalytic experiment the photocatalytic activity was studied for catalysts with tyl and tc as targeted pollutants during the experiments of simulating solar irradiation the distance from the photocatalytic reactor to the lamp 170 w xenon lamp full wavelength was held at 2 cm the pptz membrane sample was added to 60 ml of tyl solution 25 mg l or tc 25 mg l darkroom adsorption equilibration lasted for 30 min prior to photocatalysis the mixture was then subjected to continuous aeration stirring 0 75 l min with the light on the sample solutions at different time periods were centrifuged for 5 min the absorbance of tyl and tc in the sampling solution was measured by uv spectrophotometer and then the concentration of the antibiotic was calculated from the absorbance the limits of detection for tc and tyl absorbance in absorbance determination were 0 4 mg l and 0 51 mg l to ensure reproducible antibiotic removal of the pptz membranes five cycles of antibiotic degradation were performed after each experimental cycle the films were repeatedly cleaned four times with deionized water and absolute ethanol and then placed in the oven to dry for the next experiments 2 6 toxicity test the catalyst was added to deionized water and stirred for 8 h the supernatant was taken for centrifugation subsequently 20 full grained uniformly sized seeds of brassica juncea were chosen and put in filter paper petri dishes to which 5 ml of supernatant was added and the petri dishes were placed in an incubator at 25 c for 3 days seeds cultured in deionized water were used as a blank control group and three parallel experiments were performed for each percolate the calculation formula of seed germination index sgi is as follows 3 1 sgi average germination rate lc average root length lc average germination rate dw average root length dw 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 structure and composition ftir measurements were used to verify the crystal structures of xpt x 100 150 and 200 pan ppt and pptz catalysts it can be seen from fig 2 that a strong band region was displayed at 1200 1650 cm 1 which was characteristic of aromatic cn heterocycles the absorption band at 1640 cm 1 was caused by cn stretching and the other three bands at 1558 cm 1 1458 cm 1 and 1398 cm 1 were typical of the stretching vibrational modes typical of cn heterocycles 18 20 the two bands at about 1317 cm 1 and 1249 cm 1 were associated with cnhc partially condensed or n c 3 fully condensed stretching vibrations of the connecting unit a characteristic vibration of the triazine ring at 815 cm 1 was also observed 21 the pptz sample revealed a similar structure further demonstrating the presence of tcn in the catalysts moreover two peaks at 1384 and 1631 cm 1 belonged to surface absorbing acid molecules indicating the presence of hydroxyl groups in znin2s4 which were also present in the pptz nanocomposites 22 these results indicate that the synthesis was successful for pptz nanocomposites the bands at 1506 and 1618 cm 1 were the tensile vibrations of the pda structure 23 fig 3 shows the xrd patterns of xpt x 100 150 and 200 pan ppt and pptz as can be seen from the figure the intensity of 200pt peaks between 27 6 and 32 5 was significantly higher than that of 100pt and 150pt there were two main reasons for the higher xrd peaks intensity of 200pt a peak intensity increased due to a large amount of doped tcn b in the spinning process the tcn cannot been controlled to spray evenly resulting in high tcn content in some parts it can also been observed from the sem figure that nodules will occur in some places on the spinning membrane the pan membrane had a distinct strong diffraction peak at 17 4 24 however there was no obvious characteristic peak at 17 4 in the pptz the reason may be that the percentage of pan in the pptz composite becomes smaller which causes the characteristic peak to be inconspicuous the diffraction peak was characteristic of the mellon compound and had an index of 100 for the pptz nanocomposite a characteristic diffraction peak at 27 6 overlaps with the reflection peak 002 of g c3n4 27 5 and the reflection peak 102 of hexagonal znin2s4 jcpds no 65 2023 25 from the fig 4b the doping of tcn in pan could be clearly seen in the spun fibres with embedded tcn particles the diameter of which was around 20 nm fig 4f from the fig 4c a large number of microspheric pda were found to be polymerised on the spun fiber membrane and marigold like zis were found closely attached to the pda with the diameter of 3 5 μm on fig 4d it was also clear from the tem images that the pda and zis were tightly attached to the fibres fig 4e f it can also be seen that the diameter of the membrane fibres was approximately 7 nm the successful synthesis of multifaceted photocatalytic films can be observed visually moreover the two dimensional and three dimensional images of the dynamic photocatalytic membrane are shown in fig 4 g h respectively it can be found that the roughness of the membrane was 41 2 nm the fig 5 shows the xps energy spectra of six elements c n zn in s and tb in the 150tcn zis catalyst as can be seen from the fig 5a the spectra of c1s at 283 6 ev and 287 5 ev were corresponding to the sp2 hybridised cc and ncn respectively 4 5 which originated from coupled g c3n4 in fig 5b the high resolution spectra of n1s are located at 398 7 ev 399 4 ev and 400 9 ev the peaks at 398 7 ev and 399 9 ev are sp2 hybrid n attributing to n on nc bond and n c 3 bond 3 the zn 2p spectrum had two peaks at 1044 8 ev and 1021 7 ev which belonged to zn 2p1 2 and zn 2p3 2 respectively the peaks binding energy of the in 3d spectrum at 445 0 ev and 452 6 ev belonged to in 3d5 2 and in 3d3 2 respectively the peaks of the s 2p spectrum at 161 6 ev and 162 7 ev belonged to s the binding energy values are consistent with those reported in the previous literature so the valence states of zn s and in can be determined as 2 2 and 3 respectively 15 22 26 the peak around 161 7 ev in the figure belonged to tb 4d5 2 it is proved that the doped tb existed in the form of tb iii 27 the absorbance properties of the samples were determined by a uv vis spectrophotometer fig 6 the absorption edge of pure pt could be obtained from the graph at about 460 nm in contrast the light absorption edge of pptz was shifted to 580 nm fig 6a which may be due to the existence of a heterojunction among pda zis and g c3n4 the forbidden band width eg of the catalyst was calculated by the kubelka munk function αhv a hv eg n 2 5 the diagram plots a tangent line with hv and αhv 1 2 as the horizontal coordinates and the intersection of the tangent line and the horizontal coordinates was the bandgap energy the band gap energy of the pptz sample was 1 86 ev which was lower than the band gap of pt as shown in the fig 6b generally speaking the higher the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes the higher the fluorescence intensity in order to study the migration and separation of photogenerated electrons and holes in the pptz sample pl characterizations of pt and pptz samples were determined at 300 nm excitation wavelength and shown in fig 6c the fig 6c showed that there was a strong emission peak at 452 nm for pt which implied a high recombination rate of the photogenerated carriers there was almost no emission peak for ppt and pptz and the comparison of photoluminescence intensity was pt pptz suggesting that the separation of photogenerated e and h for pptz was significantly better than that of pt which is due to photocatalysts forming heterojunctions with pda and zis this can be explained by the electron transfer function of pda which was caused by an extended π conjugated system with abundant semi quinone and quinone groups 17 hence the construction of pptz can enhance the light absorption and reduce the e h recombination so that the pptz membrane has high photocatalytic activity 3 2 dft calculation the structure of the pptz monolayer was investigated and the geometry of the heterojunction was shown in fig 7a b after structural optimisation the optimum interfacial layer distances d1 and d2 in the vertical direction were calculated to be respectively 2 99 å and 2 49 å in the pptz system such large interfacial distances showed that tcn was interacting with zis and pda through weak van der waals vdws forces rather than forming covalent interactions furthermore in addition to the equilibrium distance between the interfaces the interfacial geometry of the heterojunction also demonstrates the strength of the interfacial interactions as shown in the fig 7c the three dimensional differential charge density was calculated from this it can be seen that electrons were transferred from the tcn to the zis and pda thus introducing the built in electric field which acted as a driving force to separate the photogenerated carriers 8 9 3 3 photocatalytic activity in order to determine the optimum dosage of tcn doped pan spun films and the performance of pptz films for photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics the experiments were carried out to study tc and tyl degradation by different catalysts under simulating sunlight the fig 8a b showed the degradation curves of tc and tyl photocatalyzed by 50pt 100pt 150pt ppt and pptz respectively in the absence of a catalyst there is little degradation of tc and tyl 100pt displayed the optimum photocatalytic performance during the xpt samples after 90 min of simulated solar irradiation indicating that 100 mg of tcn was the optimum addition into pan film as expected the pptz nanocomposites showed higher photocatalytic degradation rates pptz degraded tc and tyl with 80 and 82 efficiency respectively much higher than pt and ppt in order to intuitively compare the photocatalytic activity of the films the results of the photocatalytic degradation were subjected to a quasi level kinetic study with the following equations ln c c 0 kt where c was the concentration of tyl and tc at irradiation time t min c0 was the initial concentration of tyl and tc and k represents the apparent reaction rate constant from fig 8c d it can be found that the reaction rate constants k of pptz degradation of tc and tyl are 2 2 and 1 6 times that of pt there are two possible reasons for this effect firstly zis and tcn formed a heterojunction because the forbidden band width of zis was smaller which could generate more photogenerated electrons and the electron hole complexation rate was reduced by electron transfer secondly pda could act as an electron transfer medium to reduce electron hole recombination the main reaction mechanism will be detailed in subsection 3 5 3 4 photocatalytic reaction mechanism the general principle of photocatalysis is that light excites the photocatalytic material to produce electrons and holes in the aqueous phase which then produce oxide species such as o2 and oh therefore the discovery of the main oxide species generated in the degradation reaction is essential to explain the mechanism of the photocatalytic reaction by adding different trapping agents to neutralize free radicals the main oxide species involved in the degradation process during catalysis were identified isopropanol ipa ammonium oxalate ao and benzoquinone bq are commonly utilized as trapping agents for oh h and o2 respectively 5 as shown in fig 9 the degradation rate of tc varies were 71 7 35 7 67 and 65 4 with the addition of bq ipa and ao respectively from the results of the radical capture experiments when bq was added during the degradation process it had the greatest inhibitory effect on the photocatalytic membrane degradation of tc followed by ao thus it was concluded from the experimental results that o2 was the most important active species the addition of ao ipa also inhibited the degradation effect to some extent indicating that oh and h were also involved in the reaction during the photocatalytic degradation of tc the order of importance of the redox species was o2 h oh therefore o2 and h played the most important role in the whole degradation process according to the above experimental findings and the characterisation results the photocatalytic reaction mechanism for degradation of antibiotics with pptz nanocomposite films was proposed theoretically the conduction band cb of g c3n4 is 1 1 ev and valence band vb is 1 6 ev 3 the cb and vb of zis are 0 41 ev and 1 45 ev 28 when the material is excited by light electrons leap from vb to cb due to the potential difference between zis and tcn the part of the electrons in the tcn cb pass through the tightly connected interface and then migrate rapidly into the zis cb other part of the electrons leap to the tb iii impurity energy level and pda compared to traditional binary heterojunctions pptz reduced the recombination of electrons and holes during photocatalysis during the photocatalytic reaction the electrons are excited by light to transition from vb to cb then the h is left on the vb which is oxidizing and can directly oxidize antibiotics to achieve the purpose of removing them the electrons enriched on the zis cb can reduce the catalyst surface o2 to o2 which also contribute to oxidizing the organic pollutant this is due to the fact that the reduction potential of photogenerated e of the pptz is lower than o2 o2 0 33 ev 29 as can be seen from fig 10 the addition of hydroxyl radical scavengers will also have some effects on photocatalytic performance the main reason for this result is that the redox potentials of oh oh and oh h2o was determined to be 1 99 ev and 2 27 ev this is higher than the highest potential of cn and zis occupying molecular orbitals so h in vb can t oxidize h2o or oh to produce oh it can be concluded from this that oh should be made up of o2 generated therefore when hydroxyl radical scavengers are added the photocatalytic performance will be reduced 30 31 the photogenerated e h are effectively separated during the whole reaction process and the active substances h and o2 generated by the photoreaction will carry out redox reactions with antibiotics at the same time pda as a photosensitiser could effectively promote the light absorption capacity and generate more carriers in the catalytic system to participate in the photocatalytic reaction not only that but pda also acted as an interfacial medium connecting the heterojunction to the thin membrane and could facilitate efficient transport of carriers across the heterojunction interface there was also the doping of the catalyst with trace amounts of rare earth trivalent cations tb3 which can play a role in trapping electron effectively trapping electrons located on vb and restoring them to tb2 in conclusion the pptz photocatalytic nanofiber films allow more e and h to participate in photocatalytic reactions and then have better photocatalytic performance 3 5 stability of pptz photocatalytic films the stability of pptz photocatalytic films was determined by three cycles of degradation tyl experiments it can be seen from fig 11 that the efficiency of tyl degradation in pptz samples still remained around 75 indicating that the pptz films have good stability in practical applications 3 6 toxicity experiments in order to test the toxicity of the photocatalysts the average root length al and germination rate of seeds sr of bok choy seeds were obtained from seed germination tests and the seed germination index sgi was derived from eq 1 the fig 12 shows the germination photos with different catalysts leachates as culture solutions the al sr and sgi of bok choy seeds in the germination experiment are shown in table 1 as can be seen from table 1 the sgi of cabbage seeds cultured in the leachate of all photocatalytic materials did not differ significantly indicating that the pptz photocatalytic membrane leachate didn t affect the seed germination process 4 conclusions in this study tb g c3n4 znin2s4 photocatalysts were deposited on the surface of pan nanofibre films with pda as an intermediate linker to obtain fibrous films with photocatalytic properties through a multi step preparation process the membrane surface gradually formed a uniform and dense multilayer structure film and the surface morphology formed an undulating mountain like structure the membrane showed excellent degradation of tc and tyl with 80 and 82 4 removal rates for these two antibiotics respectively in addition the cyclic removal results of tyl showed that the nanofiber photocatalytic membrane had excellent photocatalytic performance and stability and after three cycles of experiments the photocatalytic membrane could still reach about 74 removal rate of tyl these results suggested that the preparation of nanophotocatalytic membranes by electrospinning and coating process was a viable way to address antibiotic contamination the prepared membrane improved the recyclability of photocatalytic materials and had lower toxicity which offers the possibility of favourable development for photocatalysis and degradation of antibiotics declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12571,as an efficient and economical bioremediation technology biological sulfate reduction technology has great potential for the treatment of a variety of sulfate laden wastewater heterotrophic sulfate reducing bacteria srb were able to use sulfate as an electron acceptor and utilize various organic matter as electron donors in wastewater this article summarizes the pollutants that could be removed through sulfate reduction sulfate heavy metals and emerging contaminants in various wastewater meanwhile the application of sulfate reducing technology in three typical sulfate laden wastewaters were discussed in this review to better understand and optimize the application of sulfate reduction technology for wastewater treatment this paper summarized the main influencing factors of sulfate reducing technology at the end of this review the problems waiting for further development and potential application of sulfate reducing technology in aquatic and terrestrial bioremediation were discussed graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords acidic mine drainage flue gas desulfurization wastewater influence factors saline municipal wastewater sulfate reducing bacteria data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction sulfate reducing bacteria srb were obligate anaerobes which were able to utilize a wide range of electron donors for biological sulfate reduction such as lactate propionate sugar hydrogen ethanol methanol acetate butyrate and molasses 1 srb were widely distributed in various ecosystems including soil sea oil well drainage and animal gut and plays important role in the global sulfur and carbon cycle the first srb was isolated in 1895 by martinus beijerinck which was later classified as desulfovibrio desulfuricans 2 to 1970s srb was classified into three genera of desulfovibrio desulfotomaculum and desulfomonas in 1965 because of production of spores the genus of desulfotomaculum and desulfovibrio srb were supplemented 3 with the improvement of biotechnology new genus of srbs were successively isolated and named the bergey s systematic bacteriology manual published in 1984 further updated srb to 8 genus desulfovibrio desulfomonas desulfobulbus desulfotomaculum desulfococcus desulfobacter desulfosarcina and desulfonema 4 in 2000 with the rapid development of molecular biology kristian et al 5 suggested that srb could be divided into six cluster desulfotomaculum desulfobubus desulfobacterium desulfobacter desulfococcus desulfonema desulfosarcina and desulfovibrio desulfomicrobium moreover based on 16s rrna gene sequence srb could be divided into four groups gram negative mesophilic srb gram positive spore forming srb thermophilic bacterial srb and thermophilic archaeal srb 6 recently srb was reported to presence in 5 gates including 41 genera and 168 species subspecies desulfovibrio and desulfotomaculum were the main two genera of srb involved in wastewater treatment srb could be assimilated and or dissimilated according to utilization of carbon sources the former one was named as autotrophic srb using co2 as carbon source and obtaining electrons from the oxidation of h2 7 while the latter one was named as heterotrophic srb which used organic compounds as substrates according to the carbon metabolism process srb was classified into incomplete and complete oxidation type the former srb only oxidized organic matter to acetate while the latter srb eventually degraded organic matter completely to co2 srbs performed complete carbon oxidation mainly including phylotype desulfobacter desulfobacterium desulfobacula desulfococcus desulfofrigus desulfomusa desulfonema desulforhabdus desulfotignum desulfacinum thermodesulforhabdus desulfomonile and desulfobacca the incomplete oxidation srb could be divided into four categories hydrogen oxidizing sulfate reducing bacteria hsrb acetate oxidizing sulfate reducing bacteria asrb higher fatty acids oxidizing sulfate reducing bacteria fasrb and aromatic compounds oxidizing sulfate reducing bacteria psrb 5 heterotrophic srb utilized organic compounds as carbon source and electron donors while autotrophic srb used co2 hco3 2 as the carbon source and obtained electrons through the oxidation of h2 or fe2 7 thus srb could establish two different lifestyles acetogenic or hydrogenogenic metabolism the sulfate reduction process of srb was not fully understood and probably reduced sulfate through two proposed pathways one potential pathway was assimilative sulfate reduction which uses sulfate reduction products directly for the synthesis of cellular materials another pathway was dissimilatory sulfate reduction srb could decompose organic carbon sources to carbon dioxide through complete oxidation or to acetic acid through incomplete oxidation under anaerobic conditions meanwhile small amounts of adenosine triphosphate atp and high energy electrons were produced by substrate level phosphorylation the high energy electrons released in phosphorylation were transferred step wisely to srb through the electron transport chain flavin protein cytochrome c etc which produced large amounts of atp through electron transport phosphorylation to provide energy for biochemical processes finally the sulfur oxides were reduced to s2 by consuming of atp to provide energy the proposed pathways of sulfate reduction were presented in the equations below eqs 1 3 8 in general sulfate reduction includes three main steps i sulfate activation to adenosine 5 phosphosulfate aps eq 1 ii aps reduction to sulfite eq 2 and iii sulfite reduction to sulfide eq 3 first the sulfate activated by atp sulfurylase was required to produce aps and pyrophosphate then the produced aps could be exergonic reduced to sulfite by aps reductase 9 the third step eq 3 was still a point of contention with two mechanisms proposed a pathway through trithionate and thiosulphate enabled the reduction in three stepwise two electron reduction tri thionate pathway in which trithionate and thiosulfate were formatted as intermediates 10 for the tri thionate pathway the enzyme of trithionate and thiosulfate reductases were involved black arrows represent the trithionate pathway and green arrows represent the direct pathway however neither thiosulfate nor trithionate were commonly reported intermediates in sulfate reducing pathway 11 alternatively the reduction pathway of direct six electron reduction step still could not be fully excluded direct pathway fig 1 1 1 amp 4 so 4 2 h hp 2 o 7 3 aps 2 2 aps 2 2 e 2 h

this review the mechanism for removing pollutants the role of srb in wastewater treatment and the related influencing factors were summarized to optimize sulfate reducing process which was of great significance for future application of srb driven biotechnology 2 pollutants removed by sulfate reduction various pollutants could be removed through the sulfate reduction process including metals metalloids antibiotics dyes halogenated substances and chlorinated compounds these pollutants led to serious environmental problems without proper treatment sulfate reduction process provided a potential solution for the treatment of above mentioned pollutants 2 1 metals and metalloids metals could be removed or detoxified through three different ways in the sulfate reducing system first sulfide produced by sulfate reducers reacted with dissolved heavy metals e g cd2 cu2 ni2 pb2 u6 and sb5 to form insoluble metal sulfide precipitates 12 which could be efficiently removed from wastewater due to the low solubility and high settling properties precipitation driven by sulfide could occur over a broad ph range and various metals could be recycled from the precipitated metal sulfides 13 fe3 cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 were effectively precipitated in the form of metal sulfides was below ph 4 0 second the precipitated carbonates and hydroxides on cell surfaces of srb and the produced extracellular polymeric substances eps by srb might enhance the metal removal process organic functional groups played a crucial role in fixing heavy metals mineral nucleation and metal sorption by cell membrane and eps enhanced metal removal 14 chelation between active heavy metals and organic ligands altered the existing form of metals third microbial enzymes might switch the chemical state of some heavy metals from active state to inactive state thereby reducing toxicity of metals 15 yan et al 16 reported the treatment of hexavalent chromium by reduced graphene self assembled sulfide reducing bacteria particles in this process rgo not only promoted eps production but also enhanced the ability of srb to reduce cr vi to cr iii reduced graphene self assembled sulfate reducing bacteria particles even had the potential to reduce trivalent chromium to zero valent chromium 17 the final form of metal precipitation was dependent on the solubility product k sp of metals as listed in table 1 the lower the k sp was the more intensively metal could be removed moreover the displacement reaction between various metals led to the conversion of the metal sulfides from high solubility form to low solubility form for instance the removal efficiency of mn was lower than other metals due to high solubility 15 18 because of the existence of competitive ions fe2 or zn2 under acid conditions or chelates anticoagulant substances and the complex formed by citrate and mn2 19 the manganese sulfides were hardly produced yoo et al 20 confirmed that mn2 can be removed as mns at ph 5 7 in the absence of the coexisting metal ions and citrate desulfovibrio bacteroides and sulfurovum sp srb were certified to be tolerant to high concentrations of metals and metalloids these srbs showed a promising application of bioremediation techniques in areas contaminated by heavy metals 26 27 the metal resistance genes of srb for treating wastewater containing heavy metal had been reported 28 29 the gene of zinc resistance associated protein zrap was proved to be involved in the treatment of cuprum containing wastewater by srb at high cu ii concentration zrap was significantly down regulated to reduce cu ii uptake the most upregulated gene coded for the lipid transporter protein lipid ii flippase murj which could maintain cell shape and integrity during environmental stress to reduce the stress of cu ii 30 the genus of desulfosarcina desulfobulbus desulfoobacca desulfotomaculum desulfarculus desulfovibrio and desulfomicrobium srb were detected from the groundwater with high concentration of arsenic this result might suggest correlation between srb and arsenic 31 32 as v could be reduced to as iii by s2 produced by srb but high concentration of as iii 40 mg l 1 and as v 75 mg l 1 was inhibitory to srb 33 moreover battaglia brunet et al 34 reported that desulfosporosinus like srb had arra genes that enabled reduction of as v to as iii under middle and high sulfide concentration arsenic could be removed from waste waters by production of arsenic trisulfide as2s3 arsenic disulfide as2s2 or arsenopyrite feass by srb that might also be removed by adsorption onto the surface of ferrous sulfide fes greigite and ferrous disulfide fes2 35 36 the solubility of as2s3 increased with ph enhancement therefore it is more conducive to arsenic removal under acidic conditions it should be mentioned that the h2s produced by srb would reduce as2s3 to crystalline realgar 37 the biogenic sulfide could precipitate hg ii by forming a safe byproduct hgs ksp 10 36 at 20 c 38 39 however most srb could methylate hg ii to form neurotoxic methylmercury mehg that severely threated health of human beings nevertheless mehg was not detectable in elemental sulfur reducing system and the removal efficiency of hg was 99 4 with initial mercury concentration of 50 mg l 1 40 jay et al 41 reported that the abundance of mercury methylation functional gene hgca in the elemental sulfur reducing bioreactor was lower than sulfate reducing biosystem moreover the charged hg polysulfide complexes hg sn 2 2 was not able to enter the cells in elemental sulfur reducing system resulting in failure of methylmercury production meanwhile dissolved organic matter dom might bind with the hg ii ions thereby restricting the mercury methylation process 42 importantly after addition of hg ii the relative abundance of vadincao2 genus increased from 6 4 to 19 3 that were alleviation to mercury toxicity while the relative abundance of t78 genus increased from 7 9 to 13 9 possibly enhancing the organic matter degradation by elemental sulfur reducing bacteria 43 2 2 organics compounds due to its special physiological and biochemical characteristics of srb srb treatment had applied to degrade the hard biodegradable toxic organic pollutants especially antibiotics organochlorine dyes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons besides sulfate reducing bacteria might play an active role in the process of anaerobic degradation of tetrachloro bisphenol a tcbpa lignin chlorophenols 44 45 2 2 1 common organics antibiotics were an emerging contaminate ec commonly detected in anthropogenic wastewater discharge of wastewater led to exposure of antibiotic to natural aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem with concentration varying from the range of nanogram to milligram sulfur mediated biological processes achieved significant potentials for the treatment of antibiotic containing wastewater such as sulfonamides sa sulfamethoxazole smx and sulfadiazine sd fluoroquinolones fq ciprofloxacin cip and enoxacin eno and trimethoprim pyrimidine tmp antibiotics could be effectively removed by srb 46 fang et al 47 isolated a paraclostridium sp cip degrading bacteria from the srb sludge the prolonged cip exposure prompted assemblages of desulfobacter sp srb 48 49 srb could remove the cip through both spontaneous adsorption and biodegradation cip was mainly removed via spontaneous adsorption under low cip concentration 1 mg l 1 while biodegradation was the dominant removal pathway when cip concentrations was over 5 mg l 1 47 50 the adsorption of cip by sulfate reducers might be attributed to multiple mechanisms including electrostatic attraction cation exchange and bridging π π interaction and hydrogen bond effect 48 moreover biodegradation of smx cip and tmp was probably catalyzed by the key functional enzymes of srb including cytochrome p450 cyp450 dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsr and adenosine 5 phosphosulfate reductase apr 46 smx and cip could be initiated from the cleavage of isoxazole and piperazinyl rings catalyzed by sulfite reductase and cyp450 enzymes and tmp was likely bio transformed via o demethylation and n acetylation coupled with hydroxylation reactions with cyp450 enzymes as the main functional enzymes 51 the proposed cip biodegradation mechanism in the anaerobic sulfate reducing system could be presented as followed surplus cip was pumped out of srb cells with efflux pump genes to relieve the intracellular inhibition of cip then the residually intracellular cip was then converted to six intermediates by piperazinyl substitution and hydroxylation catalyzed by intracellular cytochrome p450 enzymes as jia et al 49 reported 15 antibiotic resistance genes args beta lactam macrolide sulfonamide aminoglycoside elfamycim lincosamide macrolides lincosamids streptogramins l m s tetracycline fluoroquinolone multidrug aminoglycoside fluoroquinolone af polymyxin fosfomycin rifamycin and diaminopyrimidine resistance genes including 126 subtypes were detected in the environment with the increasing concentration of cip the abundance of fluoroquinolone resistance genes decreased while the abundance of efflux pump genes mexab oprm increased moreover cip could also be inactivated through n acetylation with piperazinyl amine group by inactivation enzymes encoded by aac 60 ib cr gene 52 jia et al 53 reported that the specific removal rates of smx via adsorption and biodegradation with srb sludge were 3 9 and 21 3 μg l 1 d 1 respectively under initial smx concentrations of 200 μg l 1 removal of smx was characterized by rapid sorption 0 5 d and slow biodegradation 7 5 d 2 2 2 dyes the textile industry and dyeing industry discharged many biorecalcitrant dyes such as azo dyes triphenomethane dyes and anthraquinone dyes the reactive azo dyes were the most commonly used dyes in textile industries containing nn group in the chemical structure the reactive anthraquinone dyes were the second most used dyes in the textile industries including the chromophore group of co in the chemical structure 54 while the triphenomethane dyes were the third largest class of dyes used in textile industries and fish farming industries as a biocide which could be identified by the presence of trityl group in the chemical structure 55 at present many studies about azo dye decolorization by srb had been studied 56 azo dyes were consisted by 1 to 3 azo bonds nn with the phenyl or naphthalene groups attached to the azo bonds moreover various functional groups might also attach to the phenyl or naphthalene groups and played important role on degradation of azo dyes by srb hydroxy oh amino nh2 and amine n were the functional groups that promote degradation of azo dyes by srb while methxy och3 sulfonate so3 nitro no2 methyl ch3 and carboxyl coo were the functional groups that inhibit microbial degradation 57 the decolorization rate of carboxyl containing azo dyes followed the order of neighbor interval opposite for degradation of the azo dye containing both hydroxyl and sulfonic acid group the order was as followed opposite interval neighbor the decolination rate of the dye was not affected by the position of nitro group when the amino or hydroxyl groups existed close to the azo bond the amino group or the hydroxyl group could form a hydrogen bond with the nitrogen atom on the azo bond increasing the activation energy for the microbial degradation of azo dyes for the dyes with similarly chemical structure the smaller molecular weighed of the azo dye was the easier the dye could be degraded the microbial degradation efficiency of azo dye was also related to the density of electron clouds increasing of electron clouds density led to decreasing of azo dye degradation due to strengthened azo bonds 58 yoo et al 59 reported the degradation of the mono azo dyes c i reactive orange 96 and di azo dyes c i reactive red 120 by desulfovibrio desulfuricans d desulfuricans suggesting two potential pathways for decolorization of azo dyes by srb i electrons generated from the resolved substrate were directly transferred via enzymes e g ferredoxin oxidoreductase hydrogenase and or coenzymes e g ferredoxin fd tetraheme cytochrome c3 to azo dyes as the terminal electron acceptor ii chemical reduction of azo dyes was conducted using strong reducing compound sulfide hs h2s produced by biological process of sulfate reduction the azo bond of the dye was reduced chemically to produced two aromatic amines and elemental sulfur in addition the higher concentration of sulfate resulted to lower oxidation reduction potential orp 150 mv values to enhanced the biodegradation of azo dye by srb 60 with exception of the aromatic amines with sulphonic acid group produced by breaking of azo bond the rest aromatic amines could be oxidized to phenolic compounds under aerobic conditions and further mineralized to co2 through ring opening reaction 61 however srb growing under anaerobic conditions could only decompose the dyes into aromatic amines thus cooperation of srb and aerobic heterotrophs was needed to completely mineralize the dyes mixed culture of four anaerobic bacteria brevibacillus aydinogluensis strain pdf25 geobacillus thermoleovorans strain np1 anoxybacillus flavithermus strain 52 1a and bacillus thermoamylovorans strain dkp and five aerobic bacteria tepidiphilus thermophilus strain jhk30 thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum strain dsm 571 thermoanaerobacterium thermostercoris strain buff caloramator proteoclasticus strain uruguayensis tepidiphilus succinatimandens strain 4bon were achieved the mixed culture completely mineralized azo dye direct black g dbg through synergic co metabolism among bacteria and enhanced formation of various functional enzymes such as laccase lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase 62 2 2 3 halogenated organic compounds halogenated organic compounds were a group of organic substances where hydrogen atoms were replaced by halogen biotic dechlorination of halogenated substances by srb might be conducted through three different pathways i co metabolism process by srb where other organic matter was supplemented as carbon source desulfobacterium autotrophicum grew with fructose salts and glucose salts as carbon source was utilized for degradation of carbon tetrachloride where chloroform and dichloromethane were produced 63 ii organochlorines were the sole carbon and energy source utilized by srb dehalobacterium formicoaceticum utilized chlorinated c1 and c2 hydrocarbons for growth 64 iii srb used the chlorinated compounds as electron acceptors for instance 3 chlorobenzoate 3cb was the electron acceptor of desulfomonile tiedjei dcb 1 65 the end product of sulfate reduction was sulfide which was both a strong reductant and nucleophile because of the high oxidation state highly halogenated compounds could be reductively dehalogenated with the presence of sulfide through hydrogenolysis the replacement of a halogen with hydrogen dihaloelimination elimination of vicinal halides to form a cc double bond and radical coupling 66 besides for mono and di halogenated compounds the dehalogenation process was commonly associated with the nucleophilic substitution especially with the presence of strong nucleophiles the reaction between halogenated organic compounds and sulfide was a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution sn2 consistent with the nucleophilic substitution between hydrogen sulfide and 1 3 dichloropropene 1 3 d 66 68 the dechlorination of dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane ddt was driven by a novel clostridium sp srb without dissimilatory sulfite reductase genes non dsrab where the coupling of srb driven sulfate redox and organochlorines dechlorination was observed the reduced sulfur compounds served as nucleophilic reductants and or electron donors and was ultimately converted to oxidized sulfur compounds oscs 69 ding et al 70 suggested the reaction between reduced sulfur species and graphite black carbon promoted the decay of hexachloroethane and ddx ddt ddd bis 6 hydroxy 2 naphthyl disulfide and dde 1 chloro 2 2 bis 4 chlorophenyl ethylene abiotically because of formation of surface bound sulfur nucleophiles 2 2 4 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons phas polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons phas were a kind of persistent organic pollutants consisting of two or more benzene rings which might arrange in lines at angles or in clusters only the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons phas with simple structure could be degraded under anaerobic conditions such as naphthalene luorene phenanthrene and fluoranthene 71 sulfate reducing system was able to degrade the phas faster than that of methanation and denitrification system 72 two pahs degradation srb naphs2 and naphs3 were isolated from the surface sediment of the near coastal zone they were identified as delta proteobacteria within the family of desulfobacteriaceae capable of degrading naphthalene naphthalene was first converted to 2 naphthalic acid through carboxylation then the produced naphthalic acid reacted with succinyl coa to formate naphthoyl coa eventually leading to the ring cleavage on the benzenes 73 tsai et al 74 obtained a mesophilic sulfate reducing enrichment from anaerobic sludge for treatment of swine wastewater fluorene and phenanthrene were converted to p cresol only in the phenanthrene system and phenol by the sulfate reducing enrichment respectively through the hydration hydrolysis and decarboxylation reaction and the removal efficiency of fluorene and phenanthrene were 88 and 65 respectively first detected the degradation of benzo a pyrene was observed in sulfate reducing marine sediment in which srb of desulfobacteraceae were the dominant species pahs with low ring degraded faster than that with high ring 75 thus there might be two potential pathways for degradation of pahs by srb i pahs was utilized as the sole carbon source and energy source for growth of srb such as naphthalene and phenanthrene ii srb used pahs and other organic matters as co metabolism substrates including macromolecular organic matter such as benzo pyrene 74 75 more specific catabolic pathways and intermediate metabolites of srb biodegradation of organic matter needed to be further investigated 3 treatment of sulfate laden wastewater by sulfate reduction process 3 1 acidic mine drainage 3 1 1 formation and characteristics of wastewater during mining exploration and exploitation acidic mine drainage amd with strong acidity high salt concentration and high dissolved metal concentration was produced due to the exposure of sulfur bearing strata to the air 76 77 the accelerated oxidation of pyrite by thiobacillus ferrooxidans was the main reason for the formation of amd with the listed chemical reactions eq 4 78 the oxidation process released ferrous sulfate and hydrogen ions 79 and other trace elements such as al mg cu zn and pb were also leached from minerals these trace elements might enter soil and water cause environmental pollution and infrastructure corrosion and pose a serious threat to human and ecological health 80 amd formation could be prevented by controlling water flow oxygen concentration and ferrous and sulfur oxidizing bacteria 81 for example oxygen could be segregated by clay accumulation or water perfusion with waste rock piles microbial inhibition could be achieved by the addition of alkaline wastes or biological inhibitors 77 82 4 2 fes 2 s 7 o 2 g 2 h 2 o l 2 fe 2 4 so 4 2 4 h 3 1 2 main treatment methods once amd was produced treatment was required to avoid environmental pollution which could be divided into active treatment and passive treatment according to operation costs and conditions the former one was commonly applied to ongoing projects and the latter was applied to abandoned projects 83 84 active treatment included chemical precipitation with the addition of alkali electrochemical treatment filtration reverse osmosis ion exchange and adsorption however the operation cost of active treatment was extremely high including chemical costs and metal containing sludge treatment costs 81 85 86 the active processing process was adding alkaline materials in the engineering reservoir for regulating ph while precipitate heavy metals 87 the traditional addition of alkaline substances was periclase brucite magnesite limestone caco3 hydrated lime ca oh 2 caustic soda naoh soda ash na2co3 calcium oxide cao and magnesium oxide mgo the latest research pioneered using the extraction of struvite from municipal sewage and the nanomaterials to treat amd 88 89 passive amd treatment technologies could be classified into two categories conventional and emerging technologies the conventional passive treatment technologies such as constructed wetlands and anaerobic sulfate reduction bioreactor have been used for a long time emerging technologies such as phytoremediation are also being investigated for effective amd remediation 77 for the passive treatment the relatively emerging passive treatment technology was phytoremediation which used phytoremediation and combined it with bacteria to treat amd more efficiently and economically as the fig 2 showed that the amd wastewater entered from the bottom of the reactor flowed out of the upper part passing through fillers substrate and plants if the resistance was applied the device forms mfc to produce electricity 90 91 biological treatment became an alternative solution for treatment of amd due to the low cost and high efficiency 92 95 during biological treatment of amd sulfate was reduced to sulfide by sulfate reducing bacteria and the resulting sulfide reacts with metal ions to form metal precipitates in the form of sulfide carbonate hydroxide and complex 96 100 most of metal sulfides were higher in stability and lower in solubility than metal carbonates and metal hydroxides thus metals could be selectively separated and recovered from various metal containing acid mine wastewater by controlling sulfide concentration and or ph value 101 5 h 2 s aq m ms s 2 h where m was a cationic metal such as fe mn cd and cr however organic matter in amd was insufficient to maintain the growth activity of srb so an additional carbon source to amd was required for sulfate reduction 15 102 it was known that volatile fatty acids acetic propionic and butyric acid and short chain fatty acids lactic acid pyruvate malic acid were the favorable carbon sources for srb hydrogen ethanol lactic acid sugar and other simple organic compounds were used by srb as electron donors because of the high affinity to srb 1 97 103 106 the degradation of complex organics by fermentative bacteria provided simple organics to srb which was the limiting step of biological sulfate reduction during amd treatment 102 107 108 commercial ethanol butanol lactic acid and monosaccharides was successfully used as carbon source and electron donors for amd desulfurization in laboratory scale investigation 109 110 lactic acid could be used as a carbon source for the rapid start up of the reactor but high concentration of lactic acid was inhibitory to srb when the ph value was 3 8 organic acid with concentration higher than 5 mm could completely inhibit the biological sulfate reduction 104 besides the high cost also limited the application of introducing organic acid ethanol was cheaper carbon source than lactic acid for srb 105 106 but acetic acid was accumulated during ethanol utilization inhibits the production of sulfide decreased ph value penetrated the cell membrane and led to cytoplasmic acidification sulfate removal efficiency was related to the introduced organic electron donors the highest sulfate removal efficiency was achieved by addition of formic acid 97 followed by lactic acid 89 malic acid 88 propanol 87 butanol 76 pyruvate 71 ethanol 70 acetic acid 65 methanol 62 and glycerol 61 under the same sulfate loading and feeding s c ratio in biofilm reactor the highest yield of sulfide production was obtained by introducing sodium acetate following by introducing ethanol methanol glycerol pyruvate acetic acid n propanol n butanol lactic acid sodium lactate propionic acid and sodium propionate 111 nevertheless sulfate reducers were efficient heterotrophs that could also utilize long chain fatty acids aromatic compounds and natural organic matters as substrates 3 the cost of introducing commercial simple organic compounds was extremely high thus researchers started to look for cheap carbon sources with high microbial activity 112 when looking for cheap carbon sources locally available organic carbon was considered to simultaneously reduce operating costs and treat organic waste 98 113 116 various natural organic compounds could be used by srb including fermentation products from grass chips modified corncobs feces sawdust grass chips lees litter compost rice husks sawdust garbage and so on which could be classified into organic wastes and cellulosic wastes 107 116 120 compared with organic wastes cellulosic wastes had higher content of lignin cellulose toc and doc and led to lower biodegradability and bacterial growth rate by introducing cellulosic wastes as carbon source for srb 107 112 117 119 121 122 because of the organic carbon in cellulosic wastes were more difficult available for srb a longer acclimatization periods were observed in passive bioreactors filled with the sawdust as the sole carbon source 92 however the sulfate and metal removal efficiency were higher in bioreactor filled with sawdust than with compost after long term operation thus cellulosic wastes such as sawdust was considered as a substrate for long term operation to achieve higher activity of srb 124 moreover addition of mixed substrates was more efficient carbon source than single substrate sulfate reducing activity could be enhanced by introducing a mixture of natural organic waste 19 98 113 115 gerald et al 98 reported that sulfate reducing activity of the passive bioreactors filled with a mixture wt carbon source was 5 times higher than the activity of bioreactor filled with only maple wood chips the mixture consisted of compost 30 poultry manure 18 and maple wood chips 2 the mixture of kitchen waste and weathered tailings modified with inorganic zeolite could effectively neutralize acidity and promoted sulfate reduction and metal removal 123 optimizing the composition of substrate mixture could further enhance the sulfate reducing activity cocos et al 113 conducted batch experiments to evaluate the activity of sulfate reduction by 17 mixtures of wood chips leaf compost poultry manure oxidized mine tailings and silica sand and achieved the optimized sulfate reduction efficiency with the mixture of 3 wood chips 30 leaf compost 20 poultry manure and 5 silica sand as a porous support it should be noted that adding food waste as a carbon source was confirmed to be a cost effective method reducing carbon source addition 100 for amd treatment where the volatile fatty acids acetic and valeric acids produced during the food waste hydrolysis was also utilized as carbon source for amd treatment 124 besides introduction of carbon rich wastewater as an external carbon source for amd desulfurization was applied as well such as industry wastewater hospital wastewater and municipal wastewater mww 125 co treatment of mww and amd was widely used in environmental remediation municipal sewage acted as organic ligands to enhance metal removal 126 and provides various electron donors to enhance the growth of microbes and promotes sulfate reduction 127 128 the inorganic components from municipal sludge could be used as an effective abiotic adsorbent to adsorb metals in amd under low ph values 129 while amd provided the high concentrations of dissolved metal and extreme low ph in amd stimulated removal of pathogens from mww 130 131 alkali production during sulfate reduction neutralized the acidity in amd and promoted chemical precipitation meanwhile phosphate in mww was performed as a flocculant to precipitate metals in amd in the form of metal phosphates and sulfate was used as electron acceptors for organic matter oxidation without aeration saving energy and reducing operation cost 128 132 in the process of co treatment sulfate reduction was the main pathway for sulfate removal nevertheless sulfate might also be precipitated in the form of schwertmannite fe8o8 oh 8 2x so4 x bauxite and gypsum the organic particulates enriched in municipal wastewater stimulated growth of srb and inhibited by the introduction of amd while the remaining srb after treatment of amd was low ph and metals resistance 127 numerous studies had shown the carbon source strongly affected microbial community and the abundance of srb hiibel et al 109 reported that the shannon diversity index for the reactor fed with ethanol hay and pine wood shavings and corn and wood shavings were 1 03 2 03 and 2 97 respectively the shannon diversity index of the down flow structured bed bioreactor dfsbr filled with vinasse was 3 732 while the chao1 index richness was 1110 133 which was higher than the chao1 index 850 of bioreactors fed with glycerol and lactate 134 these results indicated utilization of vinasse as substrate benefitted to increase richness and diversity of microbial community moreover the pre dominated sulfate reducers in vinasse packed dfsbr were geobacter 7 4 and desulfovibrio 3 4 and other srb genera such as desulfosporosinus desulfobacterium thermodesulfobium desulfobulbus sulfurospirillum desulfurella and desulfatirhabdium were occupied 0 84 of relative abundance srb in the reactor fed with ethanol accounted to 70 of the total bacterial community while the srb only attributed to 2 3 of the total bacteria in the reactor fed with lignocellulosic nevertheless the microbial richness in the reactor fed with lignocellulosic was higher than that fed with ethanol due to interaction of archaea fermentative bacteria and srb which was crucial important for the conversion of complex organic compounds into simpler compounds and the production of sulfide 133 3 2 saline municipal wastewater 3 2 1 formation and characteristics of wastewater saline wastewater was produced in industry process and coastal city several industries such as dairy products fish processing oil and leather production process produced high salinity wastewater 135 domestic sewage may also be affected by these salty industrial effluents or seawater flushing which was known as saline municipal wastewater with the development of global economic and growth population many coastal cities were facing increasingly serious water shortage seawater instead of freshwater was used as industrial cooling water and toilet flushing water which greatly reduced the freshwater consumption in coastal areas and alleviated the contradiction of water shortage hong kong used seawater for flushing toilets to save fresh water since the middle 20th century resulting in production of saline sewage in hong kong average of 5 g l 1 chloride and 167 mg l 1 sulfate 135 136 3 2 2 main treatment methods the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated sani system was developed for the treatment of saline wastewater generated by flushing city scale seawater toilets in hong kong which was a new concept for sulfate containing domestic wastewater treatment 137 138 as shown in fig 3 the sulfur cycle was closely related to the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycle and allowed simultaneous removal of sulfates carbon nitrogen and metals from wastewater in sani process organic matter was used as electron donors for sulfate reduction stage 1 while the produced sulfide was converted back to sulfate by using nitrate recycling flow as electron acceptor through autotrophic denitrification stage 2 ammonium was oxidized to nitrate through nitrification which was recycled back to autotrophic denitrification process stage 3 139 140 the sani process effectively removed organic matter and nitrogen from wastewater through the internal sulfur cycle between sulfate and sulfides a new treatment technology changed the century old biological nutrient removal bnr technology for two elements cycles between carbon and nitrogen to three elements cycles of carbon nitrogen and sulfur which was cost effective and energy saving the combined triple water supply tws and sani systems if applied in 16 coastal cities in china with major water shortages could potentially reduce fresh water demand by 3 6 billion m3 year compared with wastewater reuse and seawater desalination seawater flushing could reduce electricity and greenhouse gas emissions by 630 to 22 000 gwh and 0 4 15 million tons of carbon dioxide per year respectively in addition the sani process could avoid the production of 10 million tons of sludge reduce energy consumption by 35 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 36 compared to conventional wastewater treatment processes this equates to an annual energy saving of 1400 gwh and a reduction in co2 emissions of 1 2 million tons year 141 the sani process reduced 90 sludge production 35 energy consumption and 36 greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional biological treatment processes in addition to the sulfate driven system the sani process could be adapted to a sulfite driven system and a mixed sulfate and sulfite driven system 142 when the sulfate was the original substrate for sani process sulfate reducing stage were able to remove up to 85 of the toc at hrt of 3 h by producing 60 90 mg s l 1 dissolved forms of sulfide for subsequent denitrification 30 mg n l 1 nitrates 98 was consumed in the autotrophic denitrification stage meanwhile 90 of sulfide was oxidized to sulfate in the denitrification stage reducing sulfide pollution released to the environment 138 compared with sulfate reduction sulfite reduction required less organics 25 leaving more residual organics available for subsequent denitrification qian et al 142 developed a new mixed denitrification md sani as shown in fig 3 the cod removal efficiency achieved 95 and the specific removal rate reached 0 26 kg cod kg vss 1 d 1 in sulfite dependent sani process which was consistent with the originally sulfate related sani process 0 3 kg cod kg vss 1 d 1 while all the nitrate could be removed the mixed heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification md benefited to the rapid startup of denitrification in sani process however the inhibitory effect of additional sulfite on growth of srb was observed 143 the microbial community in the sruasb reactor of md sani varied from previous sulfate reduction reactors 144 even though the same inoculated sludge and carbon source were the used effects of c s and s n ratio on the carbon and nitrogen removal efficiency of synthetic saline municipal wastewater was investigated 145 which indicated the nitrogen removal was strongly affected by s n ratio while the cod removal was hardly influenced by c s ratio 3 3 flue gas desulfurization wastewater 3 3 1 formation and characteristics of wastewater coal fired power plants played an important role in electric power production although nuclear power plants and renewable energy were significantly developed in recent years 146 wet flue gas desulfurization wfgd was one of the most commonly used technologies to reduce so2 emissions from flue gas in coal fired power plants wet limestone seawater alkali or ammonia were used as absorbents in wet scrubbers 147 in the wet limestone flue gas desulfurization process so2 reacted with caco3 to form caso3 which was further oxidized to caso4 gypsum 6 caco 3 s so 2 g caso 3 s so 2 g 7 caso 3 aq 2 h 2 o g 1 2 o 2 g caso 4 2 h 2 o in the wfgd system sulfur dioxide and dust removal rates reached up to 98 148 however with the operation of wfgd chloride fluoride and dust were simultaneously recycled and enriched which caused serious corrosion to wfgd system 147 149 to maintain the stable operation of wfgd system and ensure the quality of gypsum products controlling the chloride concentration was required by discharging part of the supernatant regularly the discharged supernatant was so called flue gas desulfurization fgd wastewater fgd wastewater was a high salinity stream including sulfate organic matter chloride fluoride metals and so on fgd wastewater was highly corrosive to the pipeline and led to serious environmental pollution 150 the most abundant anions and cations in fgd wastewater were cl and mg2 which were in the range of 4 12 g l 1 and 5 15 g l 1 respectively while the concentrations of so4 2 and ca2 were 2 6 g l 1 and 0 8 2 g l 1 in fgd wastewater respectively 151 3 3 2 main treatment methods chemical precipitation was the most commonly used method for the treatment of fgd wastewater in coal fire power plants which was able to remove part of metals and most of the suspended solids ss mainly through chemical oxidation neutralization precipitation and flocculation processes 152 the chemical precipitation was commonly performed as followed i addition of lime emulsion to balance ph value and remove part of metals ii introduction flocculants and coagulation aids such as pac pam 147 or fecl3 150 to convert the fine particles flocculate into flocs and accelerate sedimentation iii separation and clarification of flocs the removal efficiencies of organic matters fluoride chloride and sulfate by traditional chemical precipitation methods were limited thus the recycling of the treated fgd wastewater caused serious corrosion problems moreover the operating cost was extremely high since large amounts of chemicals were introduced 153 membrane filtration 154 and evaporation 155 were new technologies developed in recent years that could effectively remove inorganic salts from fgd wastewater but the application of these technologies was limited by high investment and maintenance costs 156 to meet the zero discharge requirements of wastewater by the government a cost efficient and environmental friendly fgd wastewater treatment technology was required therefore organic matter sulfate and metal ions in desulfurization wastewater could be removed simultaneously by biological sulfate reduction a combined process of chemical precipitation and sulfate reduction cp sr had been developed for the biological treatment of flue gas desulfurization wastewater 152 which was also one of the best technologies recommended by the environmental protection agency for fgd wastewater treatment show as fig 4 157 chemical precipitation was performed as pretreatment in the cp sr process without metal traps and chemical oxidants addition the suspended solids removal efficiency achieved 97 after pre treatment fgd after pre treatment was further treated by the sulfate reduction process srb reduced sulfate to sulfides under anaerobic conditions 1 158 and the resulted sulfides precipitated metal and metalloids such as fe3 zn2 cu2 ni2 pb2 sn2 mn2 and hg2 the single strains by7 and sr10 srb were able to adapt to high salinity fgd wastewater the removal rate of 86 94 sulfate 70 100 metals and 85 95 refractory organic matter with the highest sulfate removal load could be achieved 0 50 kg so4 2 m 3 d 1 but the removal efficiency of f and cl 35 37 and 53 57 were limited by low cell density 152 therefore a mixed bacterial sulfate reducing complex mbsrc composed of two or more bacterial species has been developed for the treatment of fgd wastewater the mbsrc was more efficient than single strain bacteria in decomposing poorly degradable organic compounds 159 160 hybrid bacteria was higher tolerant or resistant to unfavorable conditions and toxic substrates due to the coupled metabolism between different species of bacteria 161 162 sulfate removal rate of mbsrc reached 0 71 kg so4 2 m 3 d 1 the organic matter removal efficiency of 97 and f and cl removal efficiency of 100 and 88 were respectively achieved 163 however the organic matter in fgd wastewater was far from enough for sulfate reduction thus an additional carbon source was required meanwhile heavy metals were toxic for srb and decreased sulfate reducing activity microbial immobilization were effective solutions to protect microorganisms from harmful compounds and adverse environmental effects polyvinyl alcohol pva sodium alginate sa and reduced graphene go were commonly used carriers for the immobilization of srb but with high cost 16 17 incineration ash was carbon and nutrient rich byproduct of biomass power plants 7 biomass yield incineration of the bottom ash served as a potentially cheap immobilization material to enhance sulfate reduction activity up to 2 9 fold which also provided additional organic carbon source for sulfate reduction 164 sani process was also performed for intergraded treatment of fgd wastewater and fresh municipal wastewater the fgd sani process provided additional options for the co treatment of industrial wastewater in mainstream wastewater treatment 144 jiang et al 144 reported co treatment of fgd wastewater and municipal wastewater treatment by sani process with sulfite as a sulfur source removal efficiency of organics achieved 86 9 in the sulfite reducing up flow anaerobic sludge bed sruasb reactor where sulfite reduction accounted to 80 cod removal with relative abundance of srb of only 18 8 the sludge yield of the sruasb reactor was 0 095 kg vss kg 1 cod which was higher than that of the sulfate reduction process but was still much lower than that of the conventional activated sludge process moreover sulfite reduction in the up flow anaerobic sludge bed reactor was also efficient in removing metals from fgd wastewater the removal efficiency of hg ii and pb ii in the reactor exceeded 99 5 with loading rates of 9 2 g m 3 d 1 pb ii and 2 6 g m 3 d 1 hg ii 165 however the application of sani system was limited by suitable sulfur source moreover the low energy reactions and fast start up of slowly growing autotrophic denitrification bacteria were challenges for sani process and deserved intensive research in future thiosulfate was the major sulfite reduction intermediate accounting to 30 of the total reduced sulfur in the reactor effluents which may accumulate in the reactor and limit sulfite reduction and organic matter oxidation rates 166 thiosulfate accumulated during sulfite reduction process since reducing thiosulfate to sulfide requires more energy than reducing sulfite to thiosulfate therefore fgd sani may require a higher cod s ratio which could be achieved by adjusting the flow ratio of fgd and municipal wastewater based on bio desulfurization technology over the past two decades biotechnology for direct treatment of sox containing waste gas in a single biofiltration system bio fgd was developed 167 this method selectively absorbed sox in weak alkaline solvent then the resulted sulfate sulfite was reduced to sulfide through anaerobic sulfate reduction in the washing solution and the produced sulfide was consequently oxidized to elemental sulfur 168 compared with the traditional chemical treatment process the bio fgd process achieved the advantages of low energy consumption low operating cost easy operation less secondary pollution and high removal efficiency moreover the recovered sulfur could be used as a pesticide fungicide fertilizer and raw material for sulfuric acid or for treat wastewater containing heavy metals 169 4 influence factors 4 1 reactor configuration bioreactors with various structure have been developed for the treatment of sulfate laden wastewater 15 19 85 114 170 172 the reactor adopted a simple passive semi passive and circulation design to make sulfate laden flow through every units and then release treated water neutralized ph and low concentrations of heavy metals and sulfates the continuous stirred tank reactor cstr anaerobic filter af anaerobic baffled reactor abr up flow anaerobic sludge bed reactor uasb anaerobic fluidized bed reactor afbr permeable reaction barrier prb anaerobic fixed bed column bioreactor microbial fuel cell mfc and constructed wetland cw horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland and floating treatment wetland were all applied for sulfate reduction and metal removal for maintaining sufficient biomass and enhance metal recovery the selection of a suitable microbial reactor was necessary as summarized in table 2 cstr was not favorable for growth of srb to improving the biomass retention as well as the mass transfer in cstr a fixed carrier was introduced to fbr which also reduced the potential of sludge cake formation on the membrane surface 173 without the addition of support abr consists of multiple compartments to isolate the microbiota in each compartment taking advantage of robust sludge retention and separation to achieve stable sulfate reduction even under harmful environmental conditions such as high acidity ph 3 and high total metal concentration 500 mg l 1 174 in the attached growth reactor it was observed that the mixture of metal precipitates and biomass led to difficulties in metal recovery and biomass losing 92 106 175 176 setting up classification units to recover metals was applicable but increased construction and operation costs 177 179 separation of sediment and sludge in a single reactor became a new solution to reduce cost gallegos garcia et al 180 reported a down flow fluidized bed reactor in which the biofilm growth on the top of reactor and the metal precipitate was recovered from the bottom of the reactor abr was a powerful reactor used for segregation of metal precipitates that accumulated in the first reactor compartment without operational interference 174 however obstruction caused by falling of biofilm was still an urgent problem for cw af and prb meanwhile high investments also limited the application of afbr mfc and uasb 4 2 c s ratio the optimized cod so4 2 ratio weight weight for sulfate reduction with various organic matters were listed in table 3 and range from 0 55 to 1 7 to achieve a complete reduction of sulfate the cod so4 2 consumption ratio ethanol for incomplete and completely oxidized srb was required to be 2 and 0 67 mol mol respectively as shown in eqs 8 and 9 189 8 2 c h 3 c h 2 oh s o 4 2 2 c h 3 co o h s h 2 h 2 o 9 c h 3 co o s o 4 2 2 hc o 3 h s nevertheless the removal cod so4 2 ratio in the sulfate reduction system was substrate dependent because of the presence of non sulfate reducing heterotrophs about 50 to 85 of organic matter was consumed through sulfate reduction while the remaining carbon consumption was contributed by other sulfur independent pathways such as fermentation acidification methanogenesis and biomass growth 92 133 189 197 srb out competed methanogens under carbon limited conditions and the produced h2s could further inhibit the activity of methanogens 95 when the cod so4 2 ratio was much lower than the theoretical ratio sulfate reduction rate and metal removal efficiency increased with increasing of cod so4 2 ratio 198 199 when the cod so4 2 ratio was much higher than the theoretical value sulfate reduction rate was no longer affect by the cod so4 2 ratio which significantly increase chemical cost and led to secondary pollution caused by residual cod 200 moreover the accumulation of excessive biodegradable carbon sources would inhibit the synthesis of catabolic enzymes 201 while excess sulfates may form ion pairs with organic compounds and reduce the electrostatic interaction between organic molecules and microbial surfaces 202 4 3 heavy metal heavy metal was toxic for srb the proposed inhibitory mechanism was as followed i heavy metals impact bacterial metabolism by competing with essential cations such as k na ii heavy metals replaced the metal in prosthetic groups of enzyme cofactors inactivating enzymes and denatured proteins iii heavy metals formed metal sulfides on the cell surface separating the substrates from the functional enzymes 203 205 previous researches developed various method to reduce the inhibitory effect of heavy metals to microorganisms i setting up a clarifier before the bioreactor for circulating sulfide containing water to precipitate metals as a scavenger moreover alkaline compounds was introduced to precipitate heavy metals 206 the addition of a carbon source as an adsorbent allowed the removal of heavy metals in the form of hydroxide and carbonate 116 ii different material used for srb immobilization were listed in table 4 microbial immobilization technology could reduce the toxicity of heavy metals prevent cell from unfavorable condition and increase the retention time of biomass in the bioreactor 207 iii some studies suggested that metals accumulated inside reactor might be released through an unknown mechanism after long term operation thus discharging of metal laden sludge regularly could reduce the toxicity of metal on microorganisms 208 iv some metal resistance srbs bacteroides thiobacillus were tolerance to the high concentration of heavy metals and metalloids and could be applied in bioremediation of metal pollution soil or wastewater 16 27 v zero valent iron zvi was used as packing material in srb system zvi was a strong reductant e0 0 447 v to reduce the redox potential and was used to maintain the anaerobic environment for srb growth 93 187 209 210 moreover zvi released fe2 to buffer ph value and produced ferrous sulfide which decreased inhibitory effect of h2s 211 moreover zvi could restore cu2 and cr6 to reduce the fluidity and toxicity of metal however with the accumulation of hydroxide and other corrosive products on the metal surface the activity of zvi decreased 212 thus the fe cu srb system was developed in which the reduction ability of zvi could be enhanced by zero valent copper 199 4 4 alkalinity the optimal ph for growth of most srb was between 5 and 9 95 217 218 growth and activity of sulfate reduction were almost inhibited when the ph was lower than 5 and higher than 9 95 217 sharma et al 219 reported that free ammonia inhibited sulfate reduction under alkaline conditions under acidic condition strong acidity was inhibitory to srb besides hydrogen sulfide and acetic acid produced by srb could severely inhibit the activity of microorganisms including sulfur producing bacteria and fermenting bacteria 220 the acid resistance srb was reported and applied to the treatment of amd by a sulfur reduction process 221 increasing of toc concentration stimulated sulfur reduction and enriched sulfate reducing bacteria under extremely acidic condition ph 3 5 of the desulfitobacterium sp ceb3 eosinophilic sulfate reducing bacteria was used for desulfurization of amd under ph 3 where copper and zinc were efficiently removed 99 222 buffering was widely used to balance ph to weakly acidic or neutral condition and were favorable ph for microbial sulfate reduction consequently the stable sulfide production maintained efficient metal removal 179 223 224 moreover addition of alkalic waste led to increase of ph value costa et al 19 placed calcite tailings at the top of the reactor as a neutralization buffer to increase the ph value from 2 5 to 8 4 addition of calcite tailings not only neutralize ph but also increased biological sulfate reduction efficiency 186 furthermore alkalic metabolic compounds produced by srb could also be recycled for balancing ph in amd without additional reagents which apparently reduced the operating cost in a pilot scale system 206 a sulfate reducing bacterium with unusual growing capacity in moderately acidic conditions selective removal of transition metals from acidic mine waters by novel consortia of acidophilic sulfidogenic bacteria 4 5 temperature most of srb were mesophilic or thermophilic anaerobes and its optimal growth temperature is 28 32 c activity of srb was significantly declined under low temperature 225 with the falling of temperature the fluidity of cell membrane and the stability of protein were decreased thereby reducing activity of the membrane proteins and rna translation efficiency 226 in addition temperature falling resulted to a decreasing transability of the cell membrane for substrate which led to lower affinity to substrate thus the production of more specific membrane components in cold resistant srb e g more unsaturated fatty acids and short chain fatty acids than in mesophilic membranes might promote substrate transport at low temperatures 227 in fgd sani process organic matter removal efficiency achieved 94 when the temperature dropped to about 10 c however when the water temperature dropped to 2 c the concentration of sulfide decreased rapidly with accumulation of thiosulfate indicating the reduction of thiosulfate to sulfide was more temperature sensitive than reduction of sulfate to thiosulfate under 2 c 144 laura et al 228 studied the sulfate activity of two srb from 9 c to 30 c the sulfate reduction rate of the cold tolerant enriched culture was up to 6 8 mmol l 1 d 1 under 9 c while the activity of the mesophilic enrichment decreased 80 to 2 6 mmol l 1 d 1 moreover the sulfate activity of srb could be restored with temperature revitalization high temperature also affected the physiology and viability of microbial cells heat induced stress acted as a barrier inside and outside the cell causing changes in the physical properties of the living cell membrane with the increase of temperature disorder of membrane lipoproteins and membrane permeability increased which might led to breaking of cell membrane 229 5 conclusions and prospective in future this paper concluded the pollutants removal by srb where the potential applications and influencing factors for sulfate reducing technology were discussed as well however there were some scientific or technical problems still waiting for investigation 1 the coexisted various pollutants in practical wastewater might cause different inhibitory effects to srb however most of studies focused only on synthetic wastewater and the interaction of multiple pollutants on srb during sulfate reduction were still not fully investigated 2 various microorganisms coexisted in sulfate reducing sludge such as methanogens acetogens and fermentative bacteria could compete with srb for electron donors which affected the removal of sulfate heavy metals and other pollutants therefore the effects of coexisted microorganisms on pollutants removal in sulfate reducing sludge systems should be further investigated 3 srb involved sulfur cycle biodegradation systems such as sani enabled rapid start up through optimized process control by adjusting srb influencing factors such as electron donor reactor configuration etc efficient and energy saving treatment of sulfate containing wastewater could be achieved 4 the inhibitory effect of unfavorable condition on the cell membrane and cell structure of srb were not fully understood such as ph c s and heavy metal it was worthwhile to investigate the cell biology of srb under unfavorable ph temperature and heavy metal concentration 5 developing the application of sulfate reduction technology in wastewater with low concentration of sulfate availability of sulfate limited the application sulfate reducing technology nevertheless co treatment of sulfate laden waste and freshwater might reduce the operation cost of wastewater which might be further developed in future 6 leakage of sulfate laden wastewater such as amd and fgd might lead to sulfate and heavy metal pollution in nature aquatic and terrestrial systems thus the sulfate reduction technology might be applied for aquatic and terrestrial bioremediation however potential emission of hydrogen sulfide through sulfate reduction needs to be carefully concerned during bioremediation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12571,as an efficient and economical bioremediation technology biological sulfate reduction technology has great potential for the treatment of a variety of sulfate laden wastewater heterotrophic sulfate reducing bacteria srb were able to use sulfate as an electron acceptor and utilize various organic matter as electron donors in wastewater this article summarizes the pollutants that could be removed through sulfate reduction sulfate heavy metals and emerging contaminants in various wastewater meanwhile the application of sulfate reducing technology in three typical sulfate laden wastewaters were discussed in this review to better understand and optimize the application of sulfate reduction technology for wastewater treatment this paper summarized the main influencing factors of sulfate reducing technology at the end of this review the problems waiting for further development and potential application of sulfate reducing technology in aquatic and terrestrial bioremediation were discussed graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords acidic mine drainage flue gas desulfurization wastewater influence factors saline municipal wastewater sulfate reducing bacteria data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction sulfate reducing bacteria srb were obligate anaerobes which were able to utilize a wide range of electron donors for biological sulfate reduction such as lactate propionate sugar hydrogen ethanol methanol acetate butyrate and molasses 1 srb were widely distributed in various ecosystems including soil sea oil well drainage and animal gut and plays important role in the global sulfur and carbon cycle the first srb was isolated in 1895 by martinus beijerinck which was later classified as desulfovibrio desulfuricans 2 to 1970s srb was classified into three genera of desulfovibrio desulfotomaculum and desulfomonas in 1965 because of production of spores the genus of desulfotomaculum and desulfovibrio srb were supplemented 3 with the improvement of biotechnology new genus of srbs were successively isolated and named the bergey s systematic bacteriology manual published in 1984 further updated srb to 8 genus desulfovibrio desulfomonas desulfobulbus desulfotomaculum desulfococcus desulfobacter desulfosarcina and desulfonema 4 in 2000 with the rapid development of molecular biology kristian et al 5 suggested that srb could be divided into six cluster desulfotomaculum desulfobubus desulfobacterium desulfobacter desulfococcus desulfonema desulfosarcina and desulfovibrio desulfomicrobium moreover based on 16s rrna gene sequence srb could be divided into four groups gram negative mesophilic srb gram positive spore forming srb thermophilic bacterial srb and thermophilic archaeal srb 6 recently srb was reported to presence in 5 gates including 41 genera and 168 species subspecies desulfovibrio and desulfotomaculum were the main two genera of srb involved in wastewater treatment srb could be assimilated and or dissimilated according to utilization of carbon sources the former one was named as autotrophic srb using co2 as carbon source and obtaining electrons from the oxidation of h2 7 while the latter one was named as heterotrophic srb which used organic compounds as substrates according to the carbon metabolism process srb was classified into incomplete and complete oxidation type the former srb only oxidized organic matter to acetate while the latter srb eventually degraded organic matter completely to co2 srbs performed complete carbon oxidation mainly including phylotype desulfobacter desulfobacterium desulfobacula desulfococcus desulfofrigus desulfomusa desulfonema desulforhabdus desulfotignum desulfacinum thermodesulforhabdus desulfomonile and desulfobacca the incomplete oxidation srb could be divided into four categories hydrogen oxidizing sulfate reducing bacteria hsrb acetate oxidizing sulfate reducing bacteria asrb higher fatty acids oxidizing sulfate reducing bacteria fasrb and aromatic compounds oxidizing sulfate reducing bacteria psrb 5 heterotrophic srb utilized organic compounds as carbon source and electron donors while autotrophic srb used co2 hco3 2 as the carbon source and obtained electrons through the oxidation of h2 or fe2 7 thus srb could establish two different lifestyles acetogenic or hydrogenogenic metabolism the sulfate reduction process of srb was not fully understood and probably reduced sulfate through two proposed pathways one potential pathway was assimilative sulfate reduction which uses sulfate reduction products directly for the synthesis of cellular materials another pathway was dissimilatory sulfate reduction srb could decompose organic carbon sources to carbon dioxide through complete oxidation or to acetic acid through incomplete oxidation under anaerobic conditions meanwhile small amounts of adenosine triphosphate atp and high energy electrons were produced by substrate level phosphorylation the high energy electrons released in phosphorylation were transferred step wisely to srb through the electron transport chain flavin protein cytochrome c etc which produced large amounts of atp through electron transport phosphorylation to provide energy for biochemical processes finally the sulfur oxides were reduced to s2 by consuming of atp to provide energy the proposed pathways of sulfate reduction were presented in the equations below eqs 1 3 8 in general sulfate reduction includes three main steps i sulfate activation to adenosine 5 phosphosulfate aps eq 1 ii aps reduction to sulfite eq 2 and iii sulfite reduction to sulfide eq 3 first the sulfate activated by atp sulfurylase was required to produce aps and pyrophosphate then the produced aps could be exergonic reduced to sulfite by aps reductase 9 the third step eq 3 was still a point of contention with two mechanisms proposed a pathway through trithionate and thiosulphate enabled the reduction in three stepwise two electron reduction tri thionate pathway in which trithionate and thiosulfate were formatted as intermediates 10 for the tri thionate pathway the enzyme of trithionate and thiosulfate reductases were involved black arrows represent the trithionate pathway and green arrows represent the direct pathway however neither thiosulfate nor trithionate were commonly reported intermediates in sulfate reducing pathway 11 alternatively the reduction pathway of direct six electron reduction step still could not be fully excluded direct pathway fig 1 1 1 amp 4 so 4 2 h hp 2 o 7 3 aps 2 2 aps 2 2 e 2 h

this review the mechanism for removing pollutants the role of srb in wastewater treatment and the related influencing factors were summarized to optimize sulfate reducing process which was of great significance for future application of srb driven biotechnology 2 pollutants removed by sulfate reduction various pollutants could be removed through the sulfate reduction process including metals metalloids antibiotics dyes halogenated substances and chlorinated compounds these pollutants led to serious environmental problems without proper treatment sulfate reduction process provided a potential solution for the treatment of above mentioned pollutants 2 1 metals and metalloids metals could be removed or detoxified through three different ways in the sulfate reducing system first sulfide produced by sulfate reducers reacted with dissolved heavy metals e g cd2 cu2 ni2 pb2 u6 and sb5 to form insoluble metal sulfide precipitates 12 which could be efficiently removed from wastewater due to the low solubility and high settling properties precipitation driven by sulfide could occur over a broad ph range and various metals could be recycled from the precipitated metal sulfides 13 fe3 cu2 pb2 cd2 and zn2 were effectively precipitated in the form of metal sulfides was below ph 4 0 second the precipitated carbonates and hydroxides on cell surfaces of srb and the produced extracellular polymeric substances eps by srb might enhance the metal removal process organic functional groups played a crucial role in fixing heavy metals mineral nucleation and metal sorption by cell membrane and eps enhanced metal removal 14 chelation between active heavy metals and organic ligands altered the existing form of metals third microbial enzymes might switch the chemical state of some heavy metals from active state to inactive state thereby reducing toxicity of metals 15 yan et al 16 reported the treatment of hexavalent chromium by reduced graphene self assembled sulfide reducing bacteria particles in this process rgo not only promoted eps production but also enhanced the ability of srb to reduce cr vi to cr iii reduced graphene self assembled sulfate reducing bacteria particles even had the potential to reduce trivalent chromium to zero valent chromium 17 the final form of metal precipitation was dependent on the solubility product k sp of metals as listed in table 1 the lower the k sp was the more intensively metal could be removed moreover the displacement reaction between various metals led to the conversion of the metal sulfides from high solubility form to low solubility form for instance the removal efficiency of mn was lower than other metals due to high solubility 15 18 because of the existence of competitive ions fe2 or zn2 under acid conditions or chelates anticoagulant substances and the complex formed by citrate and mn2 19 the manganese sulfides were hardly produced yoo et al 20 confirmed that mn2 can be removed as mns at ph 5 7 in the absence of the coexisting metal ions and citrate desulfovibrio bacteroides and sulfurovum sp srb were certified to be tolerant to high concentrations of metals and metalloids these srbs showed a promising application of bioremediation techniques in areas contaminated by heavy metals 26 27 the metal resistance genes of srb for treating wastewater containing heavy metal had been reported 28 29 the gene of zinc resistance associated protein zrap was proved to be involved in the treatment of cuprum containing wastewater by srb at high cu ii concentration zrap was significantly down regulated to reduce cu ii uptake the most upregulated gene coded for the lipid transporter protein lipid ii flippase murj which could maintain cell shape and integrity during environmental stress to reduce the stress of cu ii 30 the genus of desulfosarcina desulfobulbus desulfoobacca desulfotomaculum desulfarculus desulfovibrio and desulfomicrobium srb were detected from the groundwater with high concentration of arsenic this result might suggest correlation between srb and arsenic 31 32 as v could be reduced to as iii by s2 produced by srb but high concentration of as iii 40 mg l 1 and as v 75 mg l 1 was inhibitory to srb 33 moreover battaglia brunet et al 34 reported that desulfosporosinus like srb had arra genes that enabled reduction of as v to as iii under middle and high sulfide concentration arsenic could be removed from waste waters by production of arsenic trisulfide as2s3 arsenic disulfide as2s2 or arsenopyrite feass by srb that might also be removed by adsorption onto the surface of ferrous sulfide fes greigite and ferrous disulfide fes2 35 36 the solubility of as2s3 increased with ph enhancement therefore it is more conducive to arsenic removal under acidic conditions it should be mentioned that the h2s produced by srb would reduce as2s3 to crystalline realgar 37 the biogenic sulfide could precipitate hg ii by forming a safe byproduct hgs ksp 10 36 at 20 c 38 39 however most srb could methylate hg ii to form neurotoxic methylmercury mehg that severely threated health of human beings nevertheless mehg was not detectable in elemental sulfur reducing system and the removal efficiency of hg was 99 4 with initial mercury concentration of 50 mg l 1 40 jay et al 41 reported that the abundance of mercury methylation functional gene hgca in the elemental sulfur reducing bioreactor was lower than sulfate reducing biosystem moreover the charged hg polysulfide complexes hg sn 2 2 was not able to enter the cells in elemental sulfur reducing system resulting in failure of methylmercury production meanwhile dissolved organic matter dom might bind with the hg ii ions thereby restricting the mercury methylation process 42 importantly after addition of hg ii the relative abundance of vadincao2 genus increased from 6 4 to 19 3 that were alleviation to mercury toxicity while the relative abundance of t78 genus increased from 7 9 to 13 9 possibly enhancing the organic matter degradation by elemental sulfur reducing bacteria 43 2 2 organics compounds due to its special physiological and biochemical characteristics of srb srb treatment had applied to degrade the hard biodegradable toxic organic pollutants especially antibiotics organochlorine dyes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons besides sulfate reducing bacteria might play an active role in the process of anaerobic degradation of tetrachloro bisphenol a tcbpa lignin chlorophenols 44 45 2 2 1 common organics antibiotics were an emerging contaminate ec commonly detected in anthropogenic wastewater discharge of wastewater led to exposure of antibiotic to natural aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem with concentration varying from the range of nanogram to milligram sulfur mediated biological processes achieved significant potentials for the treatment of antibiotic containing wastewater such as sulfonamides sa sulfamethoxazole smx and sulfadiazine sd fluoroquinolones fq ciprofloxacin cip and enoxacin eno and trimethoprim pyrimidine tmp antibiotics could be effectively removed by srb 46 fang et al 47 isolated a paraclostridium sp cip degrading bacteria from the srb sludge the prolonged cip exposure prompted assemblages of desulfobacter sp srb 48 49 srb could remove the cip through both spontaneous adsorption and biodegradation cip was mainly removed via spontaneous adsorption under low cip concentration 1 mg l 1 while biodegradation was the dominant removal pathway when cip concentrations was over 5 mg l 1 47 50 the adsorption of cip by sulfate reducers might be attributed to multiple mechanisms including electrostatic attraction cation exchange and bridging π π interaction and hydrogen bond effect 48 moreover biodegradation of smx cip and tmp was probably catalyzed by the key functional enzymes of srb including cytochrome p450 cyp450 dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsr and adenosine 5 phosphosulfate reductase apr 46 smx and cip could be initiated from the cleavage of isoxazole and piperazinyl rings catalyzed by sulfite reductase and cyp450 enzymes and tmp was likely bio transformed via o demethylation and n acetylation coupled with hydroxylation reactions with cyp450 enzymes as the main functional enzymes 51 the proposed cip biodegradation mechanism in the anaerobic sulfate reducing system could be presented as followed surplus cip was pumped out of srb cells with efflux pump genes to relieve the intracellular inhibition of cip then the residually intracellular cip was then converted to six intermediates by piperazinyl substitution and hydroxylation catalyzed by intracellular cytochrome p450 enzymes as jia et al 49 reported 15 antibiotic resistance genes args beta lactam macrolide sulfonamide aminoglycoside elfamycim lincosamide macrolides lincosamids streptogramins l m s tetracycline fluoroquinolone multidrug aminoglycoside fluoroquinolone af polymyxin fosfomycin rifamycin and diaminopyrimidine resistance genes including 126 subtypes were detected in the environment with the increasing concentration of cip the abundance of fluoroquinolone resistance genes decreased while the abundance of efflux pump genes mexab oprm increased moreover cip could also be inactivated through n acetylation with piperazinyl amine group by inactivation enzymes encoded by aac 60 ib cr gene 52 jia et al 53 reported that the specific removal rates of smx via adsorption and biodegradation with srb sludge were 3 9 and 21 3 μg l 1 d 1 respectively under initial smx concentrations of 200 μg l 1 removal of smx was characterized by rapid sorption 0 5 d and slow biodegradation 7 5 d 2 2 2 dyes the textile industry and dyeing industry discharged many biorecalcitrant dyes such as azo dyes triphenomethane dyes and anthraquinone dyes the reactive azo dyes were the most commonly used dyes in textile industries containing nn group in the chemical structure the reactive anthraquinone dyes were the second most used dyes in the textile industries including the chromophore group of co in the chemical structure 54 while the triphenomethane dyes were the third largest class of dyes used in textile industries and fish farming industries as a biocide which could be identified by the presence of trityl group in the chemical structure 55 at present many studies about azo dye decolorization by srb had been studied 56 azo dyes were consisted by 1 to 3 azo bonds nn with the phenyl or naphthalene groups attached to the azo bonds moreover various functional groups might also attach to the phenyl or naphthalene groups and played important role on degradation of azo dyes by srb hydroxy oh amino nh2 and amine n were the functional groups that promote degradation of azo dyes by srb while methxy och3 sulfonate so3 nitro no2 methyl ch3 and carboxyl coo were the functional groups that inhibit microbial degradation 57 the decolorization rate of carboxyl containing azo dyes followed the order of neighbor interval opposite for degradation of the azo dye containing both hydroxyl and sulfonic acid group the order was as followed opposite interval neighbor the decolination rate of the dye was not affected by the position of nitro group when the amino or hydroxyl groups existed close to the azo bond the amino group or the hydroxyl group could form a hydrogen bond with the nitrogen atom on the azo bond increasing the activation energy for the microbial degradation of azo dyes for the dyes with similarly chemical structure the smaller molecular weighed of the azo dye was the easier the dye could be degraded the microbial degradation efficiency of azo dye was also related to the density of electron clouds increasing of electron clouds density led to decreasing of azo dye degradation due to strengthened azo bonds 58 yoo et al 59 reported the degradation of the mono azo dyes c i reactive orange 96 and di azo dyes c i reactive red 120 by desulfovibrio desulfuricans d desulfuricans suggesting two potential pathways for decolorization of azo dyes by srb i electrons generated from the resolved substrate were directly transferred via enzymes e g ferredoxin oxidoreductase hydrogenase and or coenzymes e g ferredoxin fd tetraheme cytochrome c3 to azo dyes as the terminal electron acceptor ii chemical reduction of azo dyes was conducted using strong reducing compound sulfide hs h2s produced by biological process of sulfate reduction the azo bond of the dye was reduced chemically to produced two aromatic amines and elemental sulfur in addition the higher concentration of sulfate resulted to lower oxidation reduction potential orp 150 mv values to enhanced the biodegradation of azo dye by srb 60 with exception of the aromatic amines with sulphonic acid group produced by breaking of azo bond the rest aromatic amines could be oxidized to phenolic compounds under aerobic conditions and further mineralized to co2 through ring opening reaction 61 however srb growing under anaerobic conditions could only decompose the dyes into aromatic amines thus cooperation of srb and aerobic heterotrophs was needed to completely mineralize the dyes mixed culture of four anaerobic bacteria brevibacillus aydinogluensis strain pdf25 geobacillus thermoleovorans strain np1 anoxybacillus flavithermus strain 52 1a and bacillus thermoamylovorans strain dkp and five aerobic bacteria tepidiphilus thermophilus strain jhk30 thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum strain dsm 571 thermoanaerobacterium thermostercoris strain buff caloramator proteoclasticus strain uruguayensis tepidiphilus succinatimandens strain 4bon were achieved the mixed culture completely mineralized azo dye direct black g dbg through synergic co metabolism among bacteria and enhanced formation of various functional enzymes such as laccase lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase 62 2 2 3 halogenated organic compounds halogenated organic compounds were a group of organic substances where hydrogen atoms were replaced by halogen biotic dechlorination of halogenated substances by srb might be conducted through three different pathways i co metabolism process by srb where other organic matter was supplemented as carbon source desulfobacterium autotrophicum grew with fructose salts and glucose salts as carbon source was utilized for degradation of carbon tetrachloride where chloroform and dichloromethane were produced 63 ii organochlorines were the sole carbon and energy source utilized by srb dehalobacterium formicoaceticum utilized chlorinated c1 and c2 hydrocarbons for growth 64 iii srb used the chlorinated compounds as electron acceptors for instance 3 chlorobenzoate 3cb was the electron acceptor of desulfomonile tiedjei dcb 1 65 the end product of sulfate reduction was sulfide which was both a strong reductant and nucleophile because of the high oxidation state highly halogenated compounds could be reductively dehalogenated with the presence of sulfide through hydrogenolysis the replacement of a halogen with hydrogen dihaloelimination elimination of vicinal halides to form a cc double bond and radical coupling 66 besides for mono and di halogenated compounds the dehalogenation process was commonly associated with the nucleophilic substitution especially with the presence of strong nucleophiles the reaction between halogenated organic compounds and sulfide was a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution sn2 consistent with the nucleophilic substitution between hydrogen sulfide and 1 3 dichloropropene 1 3 d 66 68 the dechlorination of dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane ddt was driven by a novel clostridium sp srb without dissimilatory sulfite reductase genes non dsrab where the coupling of srb driven sulfate redox and organochlorines dechlorination was observed the reduced sulfur compounds served as nucleophilic reductants and or electron donors and was ultimately converted to oxidized sulfur compounds oscs 69 ding et al 70 suggested the reaction between reduced sulfur species and graphite black carbon promoted the decay of hexachloroethane and ddx ddt ddd bis 6 hydroxy 2 naphthyl disulfide and dde 1 chloro 2 2 bis 4 chlorophenyl ethylene abiotically because of formation of surface bound sulfur nucleophiles 2 2 4 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons phas polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons phas were a kind of persistent organic pollutants consisting of two or more benzene rings which might arrange in lines at angles or in clusters only the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons phas with simple structure could be degraded under anaerobic conditions such as naphthalene luorene phenanthrene and fluoranthene 71 sulfate reducing system was able to degrade the phas faster than that of methanation and denitrification system 72 two pahs degradation srb naphs2 and naphs3 were isolated from the surface sediment of the near coastal zone they were identified as delta proteobacteria within the family of desulfobacteriaceae capable of degrading naphthalene naphthalene was first converted to 2 naphthalic acid through carboxylation then the produced naphthalic acid reacted with succinyl coa to formate naphthoyl coa eventually leading to the ring cleavage on the benzenes 73 tsai et al 74 obtained a mesophilic sulfate reducing enrichment from anaerobic sludge for treatment of swine wastewater fluorene and phenanthrene were converted to p cresol only in the phenanthrene system and phenol by the sulfate reducing enrichment respectively through the hydration hydrolysis and decarboxylation reaction and the removal efficiency of fluorene and phenanthrene were 88 and 65 respectively first detected the degradation of benzo a pyrene was observed in sulfate reducing marine sediment in which srb of desulfobacteraceae were the dominant species pahs with low ring degraded faster than that with high ring 75 thus there might be two potential pathways for degradation of pahs by srb i pahs was utilized as the sole carbon source and energy source for growth of srb such as naphthalene and phenanthrene ii srb used pahs and other organic matters as co metabolism substrates including macromolecular organic matter such as benzo pyrene 74 75 more specific catabolic pathways and intermediate metabolites of srb biodegradation of organic matter needed to be further investigated 3 treatment of sulfate laden wastewater by sulfate reduction process 3 1 acidic mine drainage 3 1 1 formation and characteristics of wastewater during mining exploration and exploitation acidic mine drainage amd with strong acidity high salt concentration and high dissolved metal concentration was produced due to the exposure of sulfur bearing strata to the air 76 77 the accelerated oxidation of pyrite by thiobacillus ferrooxidans was the main reason for the formation of amd with the listed chemical reactions eq 4 78 the oxidation process released ferrous sulfate and hydrogen ions 79 and other trace elements such as al mg cu zn and pb were also leached from minerals these trace elements might enter soil and water cause environmental pollution and infrastructure corrosion and pose a serious threat to human and ecological health 80 amd formation could be prevented by controlling water flow oxygen concentration and ferrous and sulfur oxidizing bacteria 81 for example oxygen could be segregated by clay accumulation or water perfusion with waste rock piles microbial inhibition could be achieved by the addition of alkaline wastes or biological inhibitors 77 82 4 2 fes 2 s 7 o 2 g 2 h 2 o l 2 fe 2 4 so 4 2 4 h 3 1 2 main treatment methods once amd was produced treatment was required to avoid environmental pollution which could be divided into active treatment and passive treatment according to operation costs and conditions the former one was commonly applied to ongoing projects and the latter was applied to abandoned projects 83 84 active treatment included chemical precipitation with the addition of alkali electrochemical treatment filtration reverse osmosis ion exchange and adsorption however the operation cost of active treatment was extremely high including chemical costs and metal containing sludge treatment costs 81 85 86 the active processing process was adding alkaline materials in the engineering reservoir for regulating ph while precipitate heavy metals 87 the traditional addition of alkaline substances was periclase brucite magnesite limestone caco3 hydrated lime ca oh 2 caustic soda naoh soda ash na2co3 calcium oxide cao and magnesium oxide mgo the latest research pioneered using the extraction of struvite from municipal sewage and the nanomaterials to treat amd 88 89 passive amd treatment technologies could be classified into two categories conventional and emerging technologies the conventional passive treatment technologies such as constructed wetlands and anaerobic sulfate reduction bioreactor have been used for a long time emerging technologies such as phytoremediation are also being investigated for effective amd remediation 77 for the passive treatment the relatively emerging passive treatment technology was phytoremediation which used phytoremediation and combined it with bacteria to treat amd more efficiently and economically as the fig 2 showed that the amd wastewater entered from the bottom of the reactor flowed out of the upper part passing through fillers substrate and plants if the resistance was applied the device forms mfc to produce electricity 90 91 biological treatment became an alternative solution for treatment of amd due to the low cost and high efficiency 92 95 during biological treatment of amd sulfate was reduced to sulfide by sulfate reducing bacteria and the resulting sulfide reacts with metal ions to form metal precipitates in the form of sulfide carbonate hydroxide and complex 96 100 most of metal sulfides were higher in stability and lower in solubility than metal carbonates and metal hydroxides thus metals could be selectively separated and recovered from various metal containing acid mine wastewater by controlling sulfide concentration and or ph value 101 5 h 2 s aq m ms s 2 h where m was a cationic metal such as fe mn cd and cr however organic matter in amd was insufficient to maintain the growth activity of srb so an additional carbon source to amd was required for sulfate reduction 15 102 it was known that volatile fatty acids acetic propionic and butyric acid and short chain fatty acids lactic acid pyruvate malic acid were the favorable carbon sources for srb hydrogen ethanol lactic acid sugar and other simple organic compounds were used by srb as electron donors because of the high affinity to srb 1 97 103 106 the degradation of complex organics by fermentative bacteria provided simple organics to srb which was the limiting step of biological sulfate reduction during amd treatment 102 107 108 commercial ethanol butanol lactic acid and monosaccharides was successfully used as carbon source and electron donors for amd desulfurization in laboratory scale investigation 109 110 lactic acid could be used as a carbon source for the rapid start up of the reactor but high concentration of lactic acid was inhibitory to srb when the ph value was 3 8 organic acid with concentration higher than 5 mm could completely inhibit the biological sulfate reduction 104 besides the high cost also limited the application of introducing organic acid ethanol was cheaper carbon source than lactic acid for srb 105 106 but acetic acid was accumulated during ethanol utilization inhibits the production of sulfide decreased ph value penetrated the cell membrane and led to cytoplasmic acidification sulfate removal efficiency was related to the introduced organic electron donors the highest sulfate removal efficiency was achieved by addition of formic acid 97 followed by lactic acid 89 malic acid 88 propanol 87 butanol 76 pyruvate 71 ethanol 70 acetic acid 65 methanol 62 and glycerol 61 under the same sulfate loading and feeding s c ratio in biofilm reactor the highest yield of sulfide production was obtained by introducing sodium acetate following by introducing ethanol methanol glycerol pyruvate acetic acid n propanol n butanol lactic acid sodium lactate propionic acid and sodium propionate 111 nevertheless sulfate reducers were efficient heterotrophs that could also utilize long chain fatty acids aromatic compounds and natural organic matters as substrates 3 the cost of introducing commercial simple organic compounds was extremely high thus researchers started to look for cheap carbon sources with high microbial activity 112 when looking for cheap carbon sources locally available organic carbon was considered to simultaneously reduce operating costs and treat organic waste 98 113 116 various natural organic compounds could be used by srb including fermentation products from grass chips modified corncobs feces sawdust grass chips lees litter compost rice husks sawdust garbage and so on which could be classified into organic wastes and cellulosic wastes 107 116 120 compared with organic wastes cellulosic wastes had higher content of lignin cellulose toc and doc and led to lower biodegradability and bacterial growth rate by introducing cellulosic wastes as carbon source for srb 107 112 117 119 121 122 because of the organic carbon in cellulosic wastes were more difficult available for srb a longer acclimatization periods were observed in passive bioreactors filled with the sawdust as the sole carbon source 92 however the sulfate and metal removal efficiency were higher in bioreactor filled with sawdust than with compost after long term operation thus cellulosic wastes such as sawdust was considered as a substrate for long term operation to achieve higher activity of srb 124 moreover addition of mixed substrates was more efficient carbon source than single substrate sulfate reducing activity could be enhanced by introducing a mixture of natural organic waste 19 98 113 115 gerald et al 98 reported that sulfate reducing activity of the passive bioreactors filled with a mixture wt carbon source was 5 times higher than the activity of bioreactor filled with only maple wood chips the mixture consisted of compost 30 poultry manure 18 and maple wood chips 2 the mixture of kitchen waste and weathered tailings modified with inorganic zeolite could effectively neutralize acidity and promoted sulfate reduction and metal removal 123 optimizing the composition of substrate mixture could further enhance the sulfate reducing activity cocos et al 113 conducted batch experiments to evaluate the activity of sulfate reduction by 17 mixtures of wood chips leaf compost poultry manure oxidized mine tailings and silica sand and achieved the optimized sulfate reduction efficiency with the mixture of 3 wood chips 30 leaf compost 20 poultry manure and 5 silica sand as a porous support it should be noted that adding food waste as a carbon source was confirmed to be a cost effective method reducing carbon source addition 100 for amd treatment where the volatile fatty acids acetic and valeric acids produced during the food waste hydrolysis was also utilized as carbon source for amd treatment 124 besides introduction of carbon rich wastewater as an external carbon source for amd desulfurization was applied as well such as industry wastewater hospital wastewater and municipal wastewater mww 125 co treatment of mww and amd was widely used in environmental remediation municipal sewage acted as organic ligands to enhance metal removal 126 and provides various electron donors to enhance the growth of microbes and promotes sulfate reduction 127 128 the inorganic components from municipal sludge could be used as an effective abiotic adsorbent to adsorb metals in amd under low ph values 129 while amd provided the high concentrations of dissolved metal and extreme low ph in amd stimulated removal of pathogens from mww 130 131 alkali production during sulfate reduction neutralized the acidity in amd and promoted chemical precipitation meanwhile phosphate in mww was performed as a flocculant to precipitate metals in amd in the form of metal phosphates and sulfate was used as electron acceptors for organic matter oxidation without aeration saving energy and reducing operation cost 128 132 in the process of co treatment sulfate reduction was the main pathway for sulfate removal nevertheless sulfate might also be precipitated in the form of schwertmannite fe8o8 oh 8 2x so4 x bauxite and gypsum the organic particulates enriched in municipal wastewater stimulated growth of srb and inhibited by the introduction of amd while the remaining srb after treatment of amd was low ph and metals resistance 127 numerous studies had shown the carbon source strongly affected microbial community and the abundance of srb hiibel et al 109 reported that the shannon diversity index for the reactor fed with ethanol hay and pine wood shavings and corn and wood shavings were 1 03 2 03 and 2 97 respectively the shannon diversity index of the down flow structured bed bioreactor dfsbr filled with vinasse was 3 732 while the chao1 index richness was 1110 133 which was higher than the chao1 index 850 of bioreactors fed with glycerol and lactate 134 these results indicated utilization of vinasse as substrate benefitted to increase richness and diversity of microbial community moreover the pre dominated sulfate reducers in vinasse packed dfsbr were geobacter 7 4 and desulfovibrio 3 4 and other srb genera such as desulfosporosinus desulfobacterium thermodesulfobium desulfobulbus sulfurospirillum desulfurella and desulfatirhabdium were occupied 0 84 of relative abundance srb in the reactor fed with ethanol accounted to 70 of the total bacterial community while the srb only attributed to 2 3 of the total bacteria in the reactor fed with lignocellulosic nevertheless the microbial richness in the reactor fed with lignocellulosic was higher than that fed with ethanol due to interaction of archaea fermentative bacteria and srb which was crucial important for the conversion of complex organic compounds into simpler compounds and the production of sulfide 133 3 2 saline municipal wastewater 3 2 1 formation and characteristics of wastewater saline wastewater was produced in industry process and coastal city several industries such as dairy products fish processing oil and leather production process produced high salinity wastewater 135 domestic sewage may also be affected by these salty industrial effluents or seawater flushing which was known as saline municipal wastewater with the development of global economic and growth population many coastal cities were facing increasingly serious water shortage seawater instead of freshwater was used as industrial cooling water and toilet flushing water which greatly reduced the freshwater consumption in coastal areas and alleviated the contradiction of water shortage hong kong used seawater for flushing toilets to save fresh water since the middle 20th century resulting in production of saline sewage in hong kong average of 5 g l 1 chloride and 167 mg l 1 sulfate 135 136 3 2 2 main treatment methods the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated sani system was developed for the treatment of saline wastewater generated by flushing city scale seawater toilets in hong kong which was a new concept for sulfate containing domestic wastewater treatment 137 138 as shown in fig 3 the sulfur cycle was closely related to the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycle and allowed simultaneous removal of sulfates carbon nitrogen and metals from wastewater in sani process organic matter was used as electron donors for sulfate reduction stage 1 while the produced sulfide was converted back to sulfate by using nitrate recycling flow as electron acceptor through autotrophic denitrification stage 2 ammonium was oxidized to nitrate through nitrification which was recycled back to autotrophic denitrification process stage 3 139 140 the sani process effectively removed organic matter and nitrogen from wastewater through the internal sulfur cycle between sulfate and sulfides a new treatment technology changed the century old biological nutrient removal bnr technology for two elements cycles between carbon and nitrogen to three elements cycles of carbon nitrogen and sulfur which was cost effective and energy saving the combined triple water supply tws and sani systems if applied in 16 coastal cities in china with major water shortages could potentially reduce fresh water demand by 3 6 billion m3 year compared with wastewater reuse and seawater desalination seawater flushing could reduce electricity and greenhouse gas emissions by 630 to 22 000 gwh and 0 4 15 million tons of carbon dioxide per year respectively in addition the sani process could avoid the production of 10 million tons of sludge reduce energy consumption by 35 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 36 compared to conventional wastewater treatment processes this equates to an annual energy saving of 1400 gwh and a reduction in co2 emissions of 1 2 million tons year 141 the sani process reduced 90 sludge production 35 energy consumption and 36 greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional biological treatment processes in addition to the sulfate driven system the sani process could be adapted to a sulfite driven system and a mixed sulfate and sulfite driven system 142 when the sulfate was the original substrate for sani process sulfate reducing stage were able to remove up to 85 of the toc at hrt of 3 h by producing 60 90 mg s l 1 dissolved forms of sulfide for subsequent denitrification 30 mg n l 1 nitrates 98 was consumed in the autotrophic denitrification stage meanwhile 90 of sulfide was oxidized to sulfate in the denitrification stage reducing sulfide pollution released to the environment 138 compared with sulfate reduction sulfite reduction required less organics 25 leaving more residual organics available for subsequent denitrification qian et al 142 developed a new mixed denitrification md sani as shown in fig 3 the cod removal efficiency achieved 95 and the specific removal rate reached 0 26 kg cod kg vss 1 d 1 in sulfite dependent sani process which was consistent with the originally sulfate related sani process 0 3 kg cod kg vss 1 d 1 while all the nitrate could be removed the mixed heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification md benefited to the rapid startup of denitrification in sani process however the inhibitory effect of additional sulfite on growth of srb was observed 143 the microbial community in the sruasb reactor of md sani varied from previous sulfate reduction reactors 144 even though the same inoculated sludge and carbon source were the used effects of c s and s n ratio on the carbon and nitrogen removal efficiency of synthetic saline municipal wastewater was investigated 145 which indicated the nitrogen removal was strongly affected by s n ratio while the cod removal was hardly influenced by c s ratio 3 3 flue gas desulfurization wastewater 3 3 1 formation and characteristics of wastewater coal fired power plants played an important role in electric power production although nuclear power plants and renewable energy were significantly developed in recent years 146 wet flue gas desulfurization wfgd was one of the most commonly used technologies to reduce so2 emissions from flue gas in coal fired power plants wet limestone seawater alkali or ammonia were used as absorbents in wet scrubbers 147 in the wet limestone flue gas desulfurization process so2 reacted with caco3 to form caso3 which was further oxidized to caso4 gypsum 6 caco 3 s so 2 g caso 3 s so 2 g 7 caso 3 aq 2 h 2 o g 1 2 o 2 g caso 4 2 h 2 o in the wfgd system sulfur dioxide and dust removal rates reached up to 98 148 however with the operation of wfgd chloride fluoride and dust were simultaneously recycled and enriched which caused serious corrosion to wfgd system 147 149 to maintain the stable operation of wfgd system and ensure the quality of gypsum products controlling the chloride concentration was required by discharging part of the supernatant regularly the discharged supernatant was so called flue gas desulfurization fgd wastewater fgd wastewater was a high salinity stream including sulfate organic matter chloride fluoride metals and so on fgd wastewater was highly corrosive to the pipeline and led to serious environmental pollution 150 the most abundant anions and cations in fgd wastewater were cl and mg2 which were in the range of 4 12 g l 1 and 5 15 g l 1 respectively while the concentrations of so4 2 and ca2 were 2 6 g l 1 and 0 8 2 g l 1 in fgd wastewater respectively 151 3 3 2 main treatment methods chemical precipitation was the most commonly used method for the treatment of fgd wastewater in coal fire power plants which was able to remove part of metals and most of the suspended solids ss mainly through chemical oxidation neutralization precipitation and flocculation processes 152 the chemical precipitation was commonly performed as followed i addition of lime emulsion to balance ph value and remove part of metals ii introduction flocculants and coagulation aids such as pac pam 147 or fecl3 150 to convert the fine particles flocculate into flocs and accelerate sedimentation iii separation and clarification of flocs the removal efficiencies of organic matters fluoride chloride and sulfate by traditional chemical precipitation methods were limited thus the recycling of the treated fgd wastewater caused serious corrosion problems moreover the operating cost was extremely high since large amounts of chemicals were introduced 153 membrane filtration 154 and evaporation 155 were new technologies developed in recent years that could effectively remove inorganic salts from fgd wastewater but the application of these technologies was limited by high investment and maintenance costs 156 to meet the zero discharge requirements of wastewater by the government a cost efficient and environmental friendly fgd wastewater treatment technology was required therefore organic matter sulfate and metal ions in desulfurization wastewater could be removed simultaneously by biological sulfate reduction a combined process of chemical precipitation and sulfate reduction cp sr had been developed for the biological treatment of flue gas desulfurization wastewater 152 which was also one of the best technologies recommended by the environmental protection agency for fgd wastewater treatment show as fig 4 157 chemical precipitation was performed as pretreatment in the cp sr process without metal traps and chemical oxidants addition the suspended solids removal efficiency achieved 97 after pre treatment fgd after pre treatment was further treated by the sulfate reduction process srb reduced sulfate to sulfides under anaerobic conditions 1 158 and the resulted sulfides precipitated metal and metalloids such as fe3 zn2 cu2 ni2 pb2 sn2 mn2 and hg2 the single strains by7 and sr10 srb were able to adapt to high salinity fgd wastewater the removal rate of 86 94 sulfate 70 100 metals and 85 95 refractory organic matter with the highest sulfate removal load could be achieved 0 50 kg so4 2 m 3 d 1 but the removal efficiency of f and cl 35 37 and 53 57 were limited by low cell density 152 therefore a mixed bacterial sulfate reducing complex mbsrc composed of two or more bacterial species has been developed for the treatment of fgd wastewater the mbsrc was more efficient than single strain bacteria in decomposing poorly degradable organic compounds 159 160 hybrid bacteria was higher tolerant or resistant to unfavorable conditions and toxic substrates due to the coupled metabolism between different species of bacteria 161 162 sulfate removal rate of mbsrc reached 0 71 kg so4 2 m 3 d 1 the organic matter removal efficiency of 97 and f and cl removal efficiency of 100 and 88 were respectively achieved 163 however the organic matter in fgd wastewater was far from enough for sulfate reduction thus an additional carbon source was required meanwhile heavy metals were toxic for srb and decreased sulfate reducing activity microbial immobilization were effective solutions to protect microorganisms from harmful compounds and adverse environmental effects polyvinyl alcohol pva sodium alginate sa and reduced graphene go were commonly used carriers for the immobilization of srb but with high cost 16 17 incineration ash was carbon and nutrient rich byproduct of biomass power plants 7 biomass yield incineration of the bottom ash served as a potentially cheap immobilization material to enhance sulfate reduction activity up to 2 9 fold which also provided additional organic carbon source for sulfate reduction 164 sani process was also performed for intergraded treatment of fgd wastewater and fresh municipal wastewater the fgd sani process provided additional options for the co treatment of industrial wastewater in mainstream wastewater treatment 144 jiang et al 144 reported co treatment of fgd wastewater and municipal wastewater treatment by sani process with sulfite as a sulfur source removal efficiency of organics achieved 86 9 in the sulfite reducing up flow anaerobic sludge bed sruasb reactor where sulfite reduction accounted to 80 cod removal with relative abundance of srb of only 18 8 the sludge yield of the sruasb reactor was 0 095 kg vss kg 1 cod which was higher than that of the sulfate reduction process but was still much lower than that of the conventional activated sludge process moreover sulfite reduction in the up flow anaerobic sludge bed reactor was also efficient in removing metals from fgd wastewater the removal efficiency of hg ii and pb ii in the reactor exceeded 99 5 with loading rates of 9 2 g m 3 d 1 pb ii and 2 6 g m 3 d 1 hg ii 165 however the application of sani system was limited by suitable sulfur source moreover the low energy reactions and fast start up of slowly growing autotrophic denitrification bacteria were challenges for sani process and deserved intensive research in future thiosulfate was the major sulfite reduction intermediate accounting to 30 of the total reduced sulfur in the reactor effluents which may accumulate in the reactor and limit sulfite reduction and organic matter oxidation rates 166 thiosulfate accumulated during sulfite reduction process since reducing thiosulfate to sulfide requires more energy than reducing sulfite to thiosulfate therefore fgd sani may require a higher cod s ratio which could be achieved by adjusting the flow ratio of fgd and municipal wastewater based on bio desulfurization technology over the past two decades biotechnology for direct treatment of sox containing waste gas in a single biofiltration system bio fgd was developed 167 this method selectively absorbed sox in weak alkaline solvent then the resulted sulfate sulfite was reduced to sulfide through anaerobic sulfate reduction in the washing solution and the produced sulfide was consequently oxidized to elemental sulfur 168 compared with the traditional chemical treatment process the bio fgd process achieved the advantages of low energy consumption low operating cost easy operation less secondary pollution and high removal efficiency moreover the recovered sulfur could be used as a pesticide fungicide fertilizer and raw material for sulfuric acid or for treat wastewater containing heavy metals 169 4 influence factors 4 1 reactor configuration bioreactors with various structure have been developed for the treatment of sulfate laden wastewater 15 19 85 114 170 172 the reactor adopted a simple passive semi passive and circulation design to make sulfate laden flow through every units and then release treated water neutralized ph and low concentrations of heavy metals and sulfates the continuous stirred tank reactor cstr anaerobic filter af anaerobic baffled reactor abr up flow anaerobic sludge bed reactor uasb anaerobic fluidized bed reactor afbr permeable reaction barrier prb anaerobic fixed bed column bioreactor microbial fuel cell mfc and constructed wetland cw horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland and floating treatment wetland were all applied for sulfate reduction and metal removal for maintaining sufficient biomass and enhance metal recovery the selection of a suitable microbial reactor was necessary as summarized in table 2 cstr was not favorable for growth of srb to improving the biomass retention as well as the mass transfer in cstr a fixed carrier was introduced to fbr which also reduced the potential of sludge cake formation on the membrane surface 173 without the addition of support abr consists of multiple compartments to isolate the microbiota in each compartment taking advantage of robust sludge retention and separation to achieve stable sulfate reduction even under harmful environmental conditions such as high acidity ph 3 and high total metal concentration 500 mg l 1 174 in the attached growth reactor it was observed that the mixture of metal precipitates and biomass led to difficulties in metal recovery and biomass losing 92 106 175 176 setting up classification units to recover metals was applicable but increased construction and operation costs 177 179 separation of sediment and sludge in a single reactor became a new solution to reduce cost gallegos garcia et al 180 reported a down flow fluidized bed reactor in which the biofilm growth on the top of reactor and the metal precipitate was recovered from the bottom of the reactor abr was a powerful reactor used for segregation of metal precipitates that accumulated in the first reactor compartment without operational interference 174 however obstruction caused by falling of biofilm was still an urgent problem for cw af and prb meanwhile high investments also limited the application of afbr mfc and uasb 4 2 c s ratio the optimized cod so4 2 ratio weight weight for sulfate reduction with various organic matters were listed in table 3 and range from 0 55 to 1 7 to achieve a complete reduction of sulfate the cod so4 2 consumption ratio ethanol for incomplete and completely oxidized srb was required to be 2 and 0 67 mol mol respectively as shown in eqs 8 and 9 189 8 2 c h 3 c h 2 oh s o 4 2 2 c h 3 co o h s h 2 h 2 o 9 c h 3 co o s o 4 2 2 hc o 3 h s nevertheless the removal cod so4 2 ratio in the sulfate reduction system was substrate dependent because of the presence of non sulfate reducing heterotrophs about 50 to 85 of organic matter was consumed through sulfate reduction while the remaining carbon consumption was contributed by other sulfur independent pathways such as fermentation acidification methanogenesis and biomass growth 92 133 189 197 srb out competed methanogens under carbon limited conditions and the produced h2s could further inhibit the activity of methanogens 95 when the cod so4 2 ratio was much lower than the theoretical ratio sulfate reduction rate and metal removal efficiency increased with increasing of cod so4 2 ratio 198 199 when the cod so4 2 ratio was much higher than the theoretical value sulfate reduction rate was no longer affect by the cod so4 2 ratio which significantly increase chemical cost and led to secondary pollution caused by residual cod 200 moreover the accumulation of excessive biodegradable carbon sources would inhibit the synthesis of catabolic enzymes 201 while excess sulfates may form ion pairs with organic compounds and reduce the electrostatic interaction between organic molecules and microbial surfaces 202 4 3 heavy metal heavy metal was toxic for srb the proposed inhibitory mechanism was as followed i heavy metals impact bacterial metabolism by competing with essential cations such as k na ii heavy metals replaced the metal in prosthetic groups of enzyme cofactors inactivating enzymes and denatured proteins iii heavy metals formed metal sulfides on the cell surface separating the substrates from the functional enzymes 203 205 previous researches developed various method to reduce the inhibitory effect of heavy metals to microorganisms i setting up a clarifier before the bioreactor for circulating sulfide containing water to precipitate metals as a scavenger moreover alkaline compounds was introduced to precipitate heavy metals 206 the addition of a carbon source as an adsorbent allowed the removal of heavy metals in the form of hydroxide and carbonate 116 ii different material used for srb immobilization were listed in table 4 microbial immobilization technology could reduce the toxicity of heavy metals prevent cell from unfavorable condition and increase the retention time of biomass in the bioreactor 207 iii some studies suggested that metals accumulated inside reactor might be released through an unknown mechanism after long term operation thus discharging of metal laden sludge regularly could reduce the toxicity of metal on microorganisms 208 iv some metal resistance srbs bacteroides thiobacillus were tolerance to the high concentration of heavy metals and metalloids and could be applied in bioremediation of metal pollution soil or wastewater 16 27 v zero valent iron zvi was used as packing material in srb system zvi was a strong reductant e0 0 447 v to reduce the redox potential and was used to maintain the anaerobic environment for srb growth 93 187 209 210 moreover zvi released fe2 to buffer ph value and produced ferrous sulfide which decreased inhibitory effect of h2s 211 moreover zvi could restore cu2 and cr6 to reduce the fluidity and toxicity of metal however with the accumulation of hydroxide and other corrosive products on the metal surface the activity of zvi decreased 212 thus the fe cu srb system was developed in which the reduction ability of zvi could be enhanced by zero valent copper 199 4 4 alkalinity the optimal ph for growth of most srb was between 5 and 9 95 217 218 growth and activity of sulfate reduction were almost inhibited when the ph was lower than 5 and higher than 9 95 217 sharma et al 219 reported that free ammonia inhibited sulfate reduction under alkaline conditions under acidic condition strong acidity was inhibitory to srb besides hydrogen sulfide and acetic acid produced by srb could severely inhibit the activity of microorganisms including sulfur producing bacteria and fermenting bacteria 220 the acid resistance srb was reported and applied to the treatment of amd by a sulfur reduction process 221 increasing of toc concentration stimulated sulfur reduction and enriched sulfate reducing bacteria under extremely acidic condition ph 3 5 of the desulfitobacterium sp ceb3 eosinophilic sulfate reducing bacteria was used for desulfurization of amd under ph 3 where copper and zinc were efficiently removed 99 222 buffering was widely used to balance ph to weakly acidic or neutral condition and were favorable ph for microbial sulfate reduction consequently the stable sulfide production maintained efficient metal removal 179 223 224 moreover addition of alkalic waste led to increase of ph value costa et al 19 placed calcite tailings at the top of the reactor as a neutralization buffer to increase the ph value from 2 5 to 8 4 addition of calcite tailings not only neutralize ph but also increased biological sulfate reduction efficiency 186 furthermore alkalic metabolic compounds produced by srb could also be recycled for balancing ph in amd without additional reagents which apparently reduced the operating cost in a pilot scale system 206 a sulfate reducing bacterium with unusual growing capacity in moderately acidic conditions selective removal of transition metals from acidic mine waters by novel consortia of acidophilic sulfidogenic bacteria 4 5 temperature most of srb were mesophilic or thermophilic anaerobes and its optimal growth temperature is 28 32 c activity of srb was significantly declined under low temperature 225 with the falling of temperature the fluidity of cell membrane and the stability of protein were decreased thereby reducing activity of the membrane proteins and rna translation efficiency 226 in addition temperature falling resulted to a decreasing transability of the cell membrane for substrate which led to lower affinity to substrate thus the production of more specific membrane components in cold resistant srb e g more unsaturated fatty acids and short chain fatty acids than in mesophilic membranes might promote substrate transport at low temperatures 227 in fgd sani process organic matter removal efficiency achieved 94 when the temperature dropped to about 10 c however when the water temperature dropped to 2 c the concentration of sulfide decreased rapidly with accumulation of thiosulfate indicating the reduction of thiosulfate to sulfide was more temperature sensitive than reduction of sulfate to thiosulfate under 2 c 144 laura et al 228 studied the sulfate activity of two srb from 9 c to 30 c the sulfate reduction rate of the cold tolerant enriched culture was up to 6 8 mmol l 1 d 1 under 9 c while the activity of the mesophilic enrichment decreased 80 to 2 6 mmol l 1 d 1 moreover the sulfate activity of srb could be restored with temperature revitalization high temperature also affected the physiology and viability of microbial cells heat induced stress acted as a barrier inside and outside the cell causing changes in the physical properties of the living cell membrane with the increase of temperature disorder of membrane lipoproteins and membrane permeability increased which might led to breaking of cell membrane 229 5 conclusions and prospective in future this paper concluded the pollutants removal by srb where the potential applications and influencing factors for sulfate reducing technology were discussed as well however there were some scientific or technical problems still waiting for investigation 1 the coexisted various pollutants in practical wastewater might cause different inhibitory effects to srb however most of studies focused only on synthetic wastewater and the interaction of multiple pollutants on srb during sulfate reduction were still not fully investigated 2 various microorganisms coexisted in sulfate reducing sludge such as methanogens acetogens and fermentative bacteria could compete with srb for electron donors which affected the removal of sulfate heavy metals and other pollutants therefore the effects of coexisted microorganisms on pollutants removal in sulfate reducing sludge systems should be further investigated 3 srb involved sulfur cycle biodegradation systems such as sani enabled rapid start up through optimized process control by adjusting srb influencing factors such as electron donor reactor configuration etc efficient and energy saving treatment of sulfate containing wastewater could be achieved 4 the inhibitory effect of unfavorable condition on the cell membrane and cell structure of srb were not fully understood such as ph c s and heavy metal it was worthwhile to investigate the cell biology of srb under unfavorable ph temperature and heavy metal concentration 5 developing the application of sulfate reduction technology in wastewater with low concentration of sulfate availability of sulfate limited the application sulfate reducing technology nevertheless co treatment of sulfate laden waste and freshwater might reduce the operation cost of wastewater which might be further developed in future 6 leakage of sulfate laden wastewater such as amd and fgd might lead to sulfate and heavy metal pollution in nature aquatic and terrestrial systems thus the sulfate reduction technology might be applied for aquatic and terrestrial bioremediation however potential emission of hydrogen sulfide through sulfate reduction needs to be carefully concerned during bioremediation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

nitrogen phosphate and emerging pollutants are critical for safe reuse of wastewater but research in this field is limited in the present study a novel aerobic denitrifying phosphate accumulating bacterial strain rl gz01 was found to be able to utilize phthalic acid esters paes as carbon resource for cell growth based on 16s rrna gene analysis physiological and biochemical characterization and genome based average nucleotide identity calculation rl gz01 was identified as rhodococcus pyridinivorans strain rl gz01 showed high dehp degradation in alkaline conditions and good tolerance of salinity and organic solvents the degradation of dehp by rl gz01 fitted well with a modified gompertz model r2 0 9985 metabolic intermediates of dehp were identified via uhplc ms ms analysis and the catabolic pathway was proposed thereafter genes and gene clusters contributed to the utilization of dehp were analyzed through genomic analysis analysis of kegg nitrogen metabolism pathway indicated that nitrate and nitrite were further transformed into ammonium which was further used for the biosynthesis of l glutamine and l glutamate strain rl gz01 was further identified as a denitrifying phosphate accumulating organism which can accumulate phosphate by generating polyphosphate finally strain rl gz01 was applied to municipal wastewater treatment for simultaneous removal of nitrogen phosphate and dehp the removal percentages of dehp 5 mg l tn 71 2 mg l nh4 n 70 9 mg l po4 3 p 10 89 mg l and cod 622 4 mg l by strain rl gz01 were 89 94 64 45 64 94 76 30 and 63 23 within 84 h respectively these demonstrated the capability of strain rl gz01 for the biological treatment of wastewater containing paes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biodegradation phthalic acid esters nitrogen removal phosphate accumulation municipal wastewater data availability i have shared the link to my data 1 introduction plastic pollution has become a global environmental issue it was estimated that approximately 348 million tons mt of plastics were produced globally in 2017 and they were mainly used for packaging 39 7 building and construction 19 8 and automotive market 10 1 1 since most of these plastic products are used once large quantities of plastics are discharged as wastes which might finally enter aquatic ecosystems in 2016 approximately twenty three mt of plastic wastes entered aquatic environments which has been recognized to affect the global aquatic ecosystem 2 when plastic wastes are released into environments uv radiation mediated photo oxidation makes the plastics become brittle causing the generation of plastic debris 3 further with the impact of wind wave action abrasion etc plastic fragments will be degraded into micro plastics mps 0 1 μm 5 mm diameter and potentially nano plastics nps 0 1 μm diameter 4 recently wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been proposed as significant sources of mps and nps in freshwater and marine environments 5 meanwhile occurrence fate detection and removal of microplastics in wastewater treatment was listed as the top 1 of research fronts in field of ecological and environmental sciences in 2020 http english casisd cn research rp although mps pollution in wwtps has attracted global concerns and great efforts have been made to remove mps from wastewater the elimination of eco toxic plastic additives from wastewater is still underexplored as important emerging pollutants during the decomposition of plastics plastic additives might be released from polymers 6 plasticizers are widely used as plastic additives which are applied to enhance the flexibility and durability of products since the global consumption of plasticizers in 2020 has already exceeded 10 mt https www plasticisers org plasticisers and https www statista com the elimination of plasticizers from different environments including wwtps becomes urgent the global plasticizer market was dominated by phthalic acid esters paes with a market share of 55 0 7 paes are known as external plasticizer which might be released from plastics during decomposition thus paes are ubiquitously detected in various environments and have been recognized as one of the typical emerging pollutants in municipal wastewater 8 the composition distribution and concentration of paes in wwtps have been systematically investigated table s1 the toxicological evaluation of paes has been extensively conducted and many reports demonstrated that paes exhibited carcinogenic developmental and reproductive toxicity 9 10 therefore six kinds of paes have been listed as the priority pollutants by us epa european union and china national environmental monitoring center 11 13 consequently the removal of paes from municipal wastewater is critical for safe reuse of wastewater different methods can be employed to eliminate paes from wastewater including chemical physical and biological degradation among these methods bacteria mediated degradation has been recognized as the most ecological method for paes elimination paes degrading bacterial strains have been extensively isolated and investigated and some of these isolates have been applied for the bioremediation of paes contaminated environments 7 however the application of bacterial isolates for the elimination of paes from wastewater is rarely reported meanwhile nitrogen and phosphate are the leading causes of water eutrophication and the removal of nitrogen and phosphate is recognized as the emphasis in wastewater treatment field for eutrophication control while the removal of nitrogen and phosphate is mainly achieved via biological treatment conventionally alternative anaerobic aerobic conditions are needed in the biological removal of nitrogen and phosphate process which makes the treatment system complicated and energy intensive 14 further different functional microorganisms are needed for the biological treatment process such as nitrifying bacteria

number 62401 the 16s rrna gene of strain rl gz01 has been deposited in genbank with accession number op320921 genome information for the chromosome and plasmids of strain rl gz01 were deposited in genbank under the accession numbers cp103308 cp103309 cp103310 and cp103311 respectively 3 result and discussion 3 1 strain rl gz01 capable of degrading dehp and removing nitrogen and phosphate one bacterium rl gz01 exhibited the capability of utilizing dehp for cell growth was obtained from the sediment samples and 100 mg l of dehp was entirely eliminated within 24 h with a significant increase of od600 value fig 2a however the cell growth was relatively lagging behind the degradation of dehp meanwhile the nitrogen removal performance of strain rl gz01 was presented in fig 2 when nh4 2so4 was supplied as the sole nitrogen source no obvious lag phase of cell growth was observed and 95 6 of nh4 n was reduced with a maximum removal rate of 2 85 mg l h between 24 h and 36 h fig 2b with a short time 12h lag phase no3 n and no2 n were rapidly removed between 24 h and 48 h and the removal percentages were 93 8 and 94 4 within 72 h respectively fig 2c and d phosphate could be rapidly removed by strain rl gz01 with 91 5 removal percentages 84 h and a maximum removal rate of 0 43 mg l h between 48 h and 60 h the colony morphology of strain rl gz01 on the lb solid plate was round orange colored sheeny opaque prominent smooth on the surface and with regular edges fig 3a the scanning electron microscope sem image showed that strain rl gz01 was rod shaped without flagellum fig 3b the 16s rrna gene sequence of strain rl gz01 was amplified and sequenced with a length of 1484 bp the phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna gene indicated that strain rl gz01 has the closest relationship with the species of rhodococcus pyridinovorans fig 3c the physio biochemical properties of strain rl gz01 were presented in table s6 the ani value between the genome of rl gz01 and reference genome of rhodococcus pyridinivorans nc 023150 is 98 68 fig s1 consequently strain rl gz01 was identified as rhodococcus pyridinivorans based on 16s rrna gene analysis physio biochemical characterization and ani calculation the genus rhodococcus is a phylogenetically and catabolically diverse group that are frequent components of microbial communities in diverse natural environments including polar and alpine regions 22 numerous strains of rhodococcus spp were isolated for their versatility to decompose a wide range of natural and synthetic organic compounds 22 species rhodococcus pyridinivorans is known as pyridine degrading bacterium and several xenobiotics degrading strains of rhodococcus pyridinivorans have been reported table 1 among these strains rhodococcus pyridinivorans xb and rhodococcus pyridinovorans dnhp s2 were identified as paes degrading isolates 33 34 although rhodococcus pyridinovorans has been recognized as robust xenobiotics degrader its ability to simultaneously remove emerging pollutants and n p nutrients is rarely reported as well as its application in wastewater treatment 3 2 characterization of strain rl gz01 paes consist of dozens of compounds and are distinguished by the side chains the substrate profile assay suggested that strain rl gz01 is able to completely degrade all the selected paes within 24 h fig 4a including typical short side chain paes dep and dbp long side chain paes dnop and dehp complex side chain paes bbp and circular side chain dchp the results also suggested that the complete degradation of dep is faster than the others as the complete degradation of dehp was done in 12 h therefore we speculate that the steric effect of side chains might affect the degradation efficiency of paes which is in consist with known reports 35 36 strain rl gz01 could degrade dehp under a wide range of ph although the data shown that strain rl gz01 preferred the alkaline environments fig 4b as shown in fig 4b 100 mg l of dehp could be completely degraded within 18 h under ph 8 0 which was therefore the optimal ph dehp degradation by strain rl gz01 was significantly inhibited under ph 4 0 and 5 0 while 100 mg l of dehp could be completely degraded from ph 9 0 to 10 0 within 72 h as to the influences of temperature the concentration of dehp were presented in fig 4c and the results suggested that relatively low 10 c or relatively high 50 c temperature was unfavorable for dehp degradation the optimal incubation temperature is 30 c since 100 mg l of dehp could be completely degraded within 24 h under 30 c while it took 60 h and 72 h for 20 c and 40 c respectively further strain rl gz01 showed good tolerance of environmental salinity fig 4d when the salinity was increased to 4 0 no significant inhibiting effects was observed and 100 mg l of dehp was completely degraded by strain rl gz01 within 36 h although the degradation of dehp was slowdown under salinities 6 0 and 8 0 the complete degradation of 100 mg l of dehp was still accomplished within 72 h this is probably because strain rl gz01 was isolated from intertidal sediments of where bacteria are acclimatized to saline environment the abilities of strain rl gz01 to degrade dehp under the stress of toxic organic solvents were determined fig 4e although the selected organic solvents could inhibit the degradation of dehp to some content 100 mg l of dehp could be completely degraded for all treatments within 72 h specifically limited effects of ethyl acetate and toluene were observed since 100 mg l of dehp was completely removed within 48 h while it took a longer time for the treatments of p xylene 60 h and biphenyl 72 h finally the degradation of dehp under ph 8 0 and 30 c was applied to kinetics analysis and the data shown that strain rl gz01 mediated dehp degradation followed the modified gompertz model r2 0 9985 better compared with the first order decay model r2 0 8689 the best fitted curve for dehp degradation was shown in fig 4f the fitted curves and related parameters for the first order decay model were shown in fig s2 the kinetics analysis demonstrated that rl gz01is able to degrade dehp with a vm of 28 21 mg l h and a lag phase of 5 34 h it is widely accepted that the isolation of novel xenobiotics degrading bacteria is significant for the bioremediation of polluted sites and wastewater treatment in addition the application potential of isolated strains is mainly depended on their degrading efficiency and environmental adaptability the capability of degrading different paes is highly important for paes degrading isolates since a range of paes co exist in the real environment although strain rl gz01 could efficiently degrade different types of paes the results also suggested that the side chains in paes could hinder the degradation efficiency which is consist with known studies 37 38 and the steric effect of long or complex side chain might be the reason 7 35 36 to our knowledge most of the known paes degrading isolates showed preference to neutral or alkaline environments such as arthrobacter sp zh2 gordonia alkanivorans strain yc rl2 and rhodococcus ruber yc yt1 39 41 rl gz01 exhibited tolerance to high salinity and could efficiently degrade dehp with salinities ranging from 2 0 to 8 0 dehp degradation was completely inhibited until the salinity reached 10 0 several salt tolerant paes degrading been reported and they were mainly isolated from salinity environments such as marine plastic debris intertidal and mangrove sediments 17 41 the characteristics of salt tolerance is unique and critical for the bioremediation of saline wastewater and sediments the tolerance of solvents has also been recognized as important characteristics of microbial based remediation especially for the elimination of hydrophobic compounds 18 the solvent tolerant mechanisms of strain rl gz01 might be illustrated in our future works kinetics analysis has been extensively used to simulate the degrading process and evaluate the degradation efficiencies of different isolates 20 for the most studies of metabolic kinetics the modified gompertz model and the first order decay model were widely used while the modified gompertz model was found to be more applicable to the degradation with lag phase 17 38 42 3 3 metabolic pathway of dehp in strain rl gz01 the proposed metabolic pathway of dehp in strain rl gz01 was presented in fig 5 and the data of metabolic intermediates was shown in table s7 and fig s3 all these compounds were undetectable after 72 h which indicated that they were entirely utilized by strain rl gz01 according to the identification of metabolic intermediates we found that rl gz01 could transform the long side chain pae dehp into short side chain pae dep prior to ester bond hydrolyzation the reduction of side chain in dehp was always accomplished by β oxidation while the transformation of dep to pa was achieved through step by step hydrolyzation further phthalic acid was converted into catechol via benzoate while catechol was exploited for cell growth via the catechol branch of the β ketoadipate pathway the metabolic pathways of paes have been systematically investigated and the process is consisted of two major steps i transformation of paes into phthalic acid and ii utilization of phthalic acid 7 some strains were capable of hydrolyzing the ester bonds directly and generating pa thereafter such as mycobacterium sp yc rl4 gordonia terrae rl jc02 and halomonas sp atbc28 38 43 44 some other strains could reduce the side chain s length prior to ester bond hydrolyzation 45 although most isolates are able to transform paes into pa some of these are incapable of utilizing pa for growth such as gordonia sp jdc 2 and camelimonas sp m11 37 46 phthalic acid is the main intermediates of paes degradation the catabolic pathway of pa has been extensively investigated while pa might be transformed into some certain intermediates like pca benzoate catechol and gentisate subsequently these intermediates could be utilized for cell growth via specific metabolic pathway 7 particularly the reduction of side chain length should be significant for paes degradation even though the related studies were still limited two reasons for this viewpoint i the reduction of side chain length could extinguish the steric hinerance effects of long or complex side chains and make full utilization of side chains for growth at the same time ii the recognition of side chain toxicity was underrepresented while some of these side chains are known to be more toxic and be more recalcitrant for biodegradation such as 2 ethylhexanol side chain of dehp 47 48 thus strain rl gz01 should be recognized as an environment friendly bacterial strain for bioremediation and wastewater treatment 3 4 molecular mechanisms of dehp metabolism nitrogen and phosphate removal the genome of strain rl gz01 comprises a circular chromosome 4 948 512 bp g c content 68 04 one linear plasmid pgz01 236 455 bp g c content 64 98 and two circular plasmids pgz02 100 921 bp g c content 63 92 pgz03 87 329 bp g c content 65 48 the circular map of genome and plasmids was shown in fig s4 in total 5081 genes have been predicted in the chromosome and plasmids of strain rl gz01 among these genes 4988 of protein coding genes cdss and 93 of rna genes 12 rrna genes 55 trna genes and 26 ncrna genes were predicted functional categorization of cdss were performed with eggnog database and the results shown that 4235 84 9 of the predicted cdss were assigned to the eggnog function classification fig s5 the top three classifications with known function were transcription 357 8 33 energy production and conversion 284 6 62 and replication recombination and repair 269 6 27 the alignment of predicted cdss with kegg database revealed that 1973 of genes were involved in 112 pathways the kegg nitrogen metabolism pathway analysis demonstrated that ammonium was removed by assimilation while nitrate and nitrite were removed by ammonification and assimilation fig 5 the genes and gene clusters potentially contributed to the metabolism of dehp nitrogen and phosphate are listed in table 2 the extracellular nitrate and nitrite could be transferred into the cells with the assistance of nitrate and nitrite transporter nart while ammonium was transferred by ammonium transporter amt nitrate was transformed into nitrite by respiratory nitrate reductase narghij while nitrite was further transformed into ammonium through nitrite reductase nirbd ammonium was used for the biosynthesis of l glutamine and l glutamate via glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase respectively in addition cat gene cluster contributed to the catechol branch of β ketoadipate pathway was identified according to kegg annotation as to the hydrolyzation of ester bonds of paes a mono alkyl phthalates hydrolase gene mehph was identified through local blast while the gene involved in the transformation of paes to mono alkyl phthalates maps was still unknown for the removal of phosphate genes involved in the sensing and accumulating of environmental inorganic phosphate were identified via genome annotation and local blast analysis the pho regulon integrates the sensing of environmental inorganic phosphate pi availability with coregulation of gene expression mediating an adaptive response to pi concentration 49 phosphate transport system regulatory protein phou could regulate the transport of extracellular phosphate into cells while the transportation was mediated by a low affinity inorganic phosphate transporter pit two poly phosphate kinases ppk and ppk2 and an exopolyphosphatase ppx were identified via genome annotation ppk could catalyze the reversible transfer of the terminal phosphate of atp to form a long chain polyphosphate poly p while ppx could catalyze the liberation of phosphate from polyphosphate 50 polyphosphate glucokinase ppgk could catalyze the phosphorylation of glucose using poly p as the phosphoryl donor the phosphorylation of glucose plays a significant role in the creation of intermediates for oligosaccharide synthesis biological nitrogen removal has been recognized as the most efficient and economical approach for nitrogen removal great efforts have been made on the isolation of functional microorganisms investigation of related mechanisms and application in wastewater treatment investigations mainly focused on ammonium removal through heterotrophic nitrification by which ammonium can be oxidized to nitrate via nitrite nitrate could supply as the electronic receptor and generate nitrogen containing gas via aerobic denitrification pathways 51 although nitrogen is one of the crucial factors for cell growth the investigation of nitrogen removal via ammonium assimilation is still underrepresented while some recent works have demonstrated that heterotrophic ammonium assimilation should be considered as one of the major driving forces for aerobic denitrification 52 meanwhile study has demonstrated that α ketoglutarate generated by carbon source metabolism is an important substrate for glutamate biosynthesis since α ketoglutarate provides a carbon skeleton for microbial ammonium assimilation 53 for the simultaneous elimination of dehp and nitrogen by strain rl gz01 carbon source provided by dehp could be supplied as carbon skeleton and used for the biosynthesis of glutamate with ammonium furthermore it has been reported that some heterotrophic denitrifiers can store polyphosphate under either aerobic anoxic conditions 14 54 55 these microbes are termed as denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms dpaos and are able to derive energy from utilization of external carbon sources unlike paos 56 hence strain rl gz01 can be defined as a typical dpao which could simultaneously remove nitrogen and phosphorus by the utilization of external carbon sources dehp and other organic compounds consequently facilitating cod bod removal and dehp elimination as well owing to its ability to simultaneously remove paes nitrogen and phosphate strain rl gz01 has great application potential in the treatment of paes containing wastewater 3 5 simultaneous removal of nitrogen phosphate and dehp from municipal wastewater to evaluate the potential of strain rl gz01 in wastewater treatment the simultaneous removal of nitrogen phosphate and dehp from municipal wastewater was conducted fig 6 as shown in table s4 the total nitrogen content 74 51 mg l in municipal wastewater was mainly due to nh4 n 70 91 mg l while the concentration of po4 3 p and cod value of wastewater were 10 89 mg l and 622 4 mg l respectively the concentration of dehp in original wastewater was detected as 0 13 mg l and additional dehp was supplemented with a final concentration of 5 17 mg l after 84 h of treatment concentrations of tn and nh4 n were 50 31 mg l and 49 77 mg l in the wastewater of control treatment when strain rl gz01 was inoculated into the wastewater the residual concentrations of tn and nh4 n were reduced to 4 40 mg l and 3 72 mg l respectively the cod value showed similar tendency with tn and nh4 n specifically no obvious changes of po4 3 p concentration was observed in the control treatment while the concentration of po4 3 p was reduced to 2 58 mg l with inoculation of strain rl gz01 meanwhile after inoculation of strain rl gz01 dehp 5 17 mg l in the wastewater was completely degraded while the dehp concentration in the control treatment was decreased to 4 65 mg l after 36 h since the concentration of no3 n and no2 n were very low their contribution to tn and cod was limited and therefore insignificant thus the total removal percentages of dehp tn nh4 n po4 3 p and cod in municipal wastewater were 100 93 82 94 75 76 3 and 83 77 while the strain rl gz01 accounted for 89 94 64 45 64 94 76 30 and 63 23 respectively these results also indicated that some indigenous microbes in municipal wastewater might be involved in the removal of dehp and nitrogen overall strain rl gz01 exhibited excellent dehp nitrogen and phosphate removal ability in the treatment of dehp containing municipal wastewater as that in the test media to improve existing wastewater treatment systems the opportunities is to develop biological treatment processes for the concurrent removal of conventional pollutants essentially nitrogen and phosphorus and emerging pollutants most of the existing biological wastewater treatment systems are not designed for the elimination of emerging pollutants the current status highlights the urgent need to develop methods capable of simultaneously removing nutrients and emerging pollutants zhao et al 57 developed intermittently aerated subsurface flow constructed wetlands for the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and dimethyl phthalate from low carbon wastewaters which provided novel insights into dmp removal mechanism and useful guidance for the practical application of constructed wetlands for treating wastewater containing phthalates hong et al 58 reported a novel zn ii resistant pseudomonas stutzeri ky 37 which was capable of eliminating nitrogen and bisphenol a from wastewater at the same time both strain rl gz01 and strain ky 37 can remove nitrogen and emerging pollutants from wastewater specifically strain ky 37 was identified as a zn ii resistance aerobic denitrifier which suggested that strain ky 37 harbored great application potential in some specific situation wastewater contaminated with nitrogen bpa like endocrine disrupting chemicals and metals in contrast strain rl gz01 would be more applicable for the treatment of municipal wastewater since paes has been identified as a widely distributed emerging pollutants in municipal wastewater table s1 gani et al 59 investigated the effects of treatment configuration on the efficient removal of nitrogen and priority paes from municipal wastewater in an integrated biofilm activated sludge system which demonstrated that treatment configuration and f m ratio might be one of the guiding parameters xu et al 60 fabricated a novel biological carrier combining sponge and modified walnut shell biochar with fe3o4 which was used to remove nitrate and dep simultaneously however microbes capable of simultaneously removing paes nitrogen and phosphorus were rarely reported therefore the isolation investigation and application of strain rl gz01 provide novel potential for the treatment of paes containing municipal wastewater 4 conclusions in this study simultaneous removal of nitrogen phosphate and dehp was achieved by strain rhodococcus pyridinivorans rl gz01 strain rl gz01 showed preference to alkaline conditions and good tolerance to salinity and organic solvents the kinetics analysis demonstrated that the metabolism process of dehp in strain rl gz01 was well fitted with the modified gompertz model r2 0 9985 the catabolic pathway of dehp in strain rl gz01 was deduced by metabolites identification prior to de esterification dehp was transformed into di 2 ethyl hexyl phthalate dep via β oxidation while dep was further de esterized into phthalic acid phthalic acid was transformed into catechol via benzoate while catechol was utilized for cell growth through catechol branch of the β ketoadipate pathway genes involved in the degradation of dehp were identified via genome sequencing analysis the kegg nitrogen metabolism pathway indicated that nitrate was transformed into nitrite by a respiratory nitrate reductase while nitrite was further transformed into ammonium through a nitrite reductase ammonium was used for the biosynthesis of l glutamine and l glutamate via glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase respectively strain rl gz01 was further identified as a dpao for its capacity of phosphate accumulation finally the application of strain rl gz01 in municipal wastewater treatment was conducted for simultaneous removal of nitrogen phosphate and dehp the removal percentages of dehp tn nh4 n po4 3 p and cod by strain rl gz01 in municipal wastewater were 89 94 64 45 64 94 76 30 and 63 23 respectively suggesting excellent application potential of rl gz01 in treating paes containing wastewater declaration of competing interest the

nitrogen phosphate and emerging pollutants are critical for safe reuse of wastewater but research in this field is limited in the present study a novel aerobic denitrifying phosphate accumulating bacterial strain rl gz01 was found to be able to utilize phthalic acid esters paes as carbon resource for cell growth based on 16s rrna gene analysis physiological and biochemical characterization and genome based average nucleotide identity calculation rl gz01 was identified as rhodococcus pyridinivorans strain rl gz01 showed high dehp degradation in alkaline conditions and good tolerance of salinity and organic solvents the degradation of dehp by rl gz01 fitted well with a modified gompertz model r2 0 9985 metabolic intermediates of dehp were identified via uhplc ms ms analysis and the catabolic pathway was proposed thereafter genes and gene clusters contributed to the utilization of dehp were analyzed through genomic analysis analysis of kegg nitrogen metabolism pathway indicated that nitrate and nitrite were further transformed into ammonium which was further used for the biosynthesis of l glutamine and l glutamate strain rl gz01 was further identified as a denitrifying phosphate accumulating organism which can accumulate phosphate by generating polyphosphate finally strain rl gz01 was applied to municipal wastewater treatment for simultaneous removal of nitrogen phosphate and dehp the removal percentages of dehp 5 mg l tn 71 2 mg l nh4 n 70 9 mg l po4 3 p 10 89 mg l and cod 622 4 mg l by strain rl gz01 were 89 94 64 45 64 94 76 30 and 63 23 within 84 h respectively these demonstrated the capability of strain rl gz01 for the biological treatment of wastewater containing paes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biodegradation phthalic acid esters nitrogen removal phosphate accumulation municipal wastewater data availability i have shared the link to my data 1 introduction plastic pollution has become a global environmental issue it was estimated that approximately 348 million tons mt of plastics were produced globally in 2017 and they were mainly used for packaging 39 7 building and construction 19 8 and automotive market 10 1 1 since most of these plastic products are used once large quantities of plastics are discharged as wastes which might finally enter aquatic ecosystems in 2016 approximately twenty three mt of plastic wastes entered aquatic environments which has been recognized to affect the global aquatic ecosystem 2 when plastic wastes are released into environments uv radiation mediated photo oxidation makes the plastics become brittle causing the generation of plastic debris 3 further with the impact of wind wave action abrasion etc plastic fragments will be degraded into micro plastics mps 0 1 μm 5 mm diameter and potentially nano plastics nps 0 1 μm diameter 4 recently wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been proposed as significant sources of mps and nps in freshwater and marine environments 5 meanwhile occurrence fate detection and removal of microplastics in wastewater treatment was listed as the top 1 of research fronts in field of ecological and environmental sciences in 2020 http english casisd cn research rp although mps pollution in wwtps has attracted global concerns and great efforts have been made to remove mps from wastewater the elimination of eco toxic plastic additives from wastewater is still underexplored as important emerging pollutants during the decomposition of plastics plastic additives might be released from polymers 6 plasticizers are widely used as plastic additives which are applied to enhance the flexibility and durability of products since the global consumption of plasticizers in 2020 has already exceeded 10 mt https www plasticisers org plasticisers and https www statista com the elimination of plasticizers from different environments including wwtps becomes urgent the global plasticizer market was dominated by phthalic acid esters paes with a market share of 55 0 7 paes are known as external plasticizer which might be released from plastics during decomposition thus paes are ubiquitously detected in various environments and have been recognized as one of the typical emerging pollutants in municipal wastewater 8 the composition distribution and concentration of paes in wwtps have been systematically investigated table s1 the toxicological evaluation of paes has been extensively conducted and many reports demonstrated that paes exhibited carcinogenic developmental and reproductive toxicity 9 10 therefore six kinds of paes have been listed as the priority pollutants by us epa european union and china national environmental monitoring center 11 13 consequently the removal of paes from municipal wastewater is critical for safe reuse of wastewater different methods can be employed to eliminate paes from wastewater including chemical physical and biological degradation among these methods bacteria mediated degradation has been recognized as the most ecological method for paes elimination paes degrading bacterial strains have been extensively isolated and investigated and some of these isolates have been applied for the bioremediation of paes contaminated environments 7 however the application of bacterial isolates for the elimination of paes from wastewater is rarely reported meanwhile nitrogen and phosphate are the leading causes of water eutrophication and the removal of nitrogen and phosphate is recognized as the emphasis in wastewater treatment field for eutrophication control while the removal of nitrogen and phosphate is mainly achieved via biological treatment conventionally alternative anaerobic aerobic conditions are needed in the biological removal of nitrogen and phosphate process which makes the treatment system complicated and energy intensive 14 further different functional microorganisms are needed for the biological treatment process such as nitrifying bacteria denitrifying bacteria phosphorus accumulating organisms and emerging pollutants degraders 15 hence acquiring denitrifying and phosphorus accumulating functional microorganisms capable of degrading paes is highly advantageous for wastewater treatment since these microbes are conducive to simplify the wastewater treatment and decrease the operating costs in the present work a novel paes degrading bacterium rl gz01 with capacity of simultaneous removal of nitrogen phosphate and di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp was isolated and the identification of strain rl gz01 was done via 16s rrna gene analysis physio biochemical characterization and genome based average nucleotide identity ani calculation the substrate range of strain rl gz01 was determined with different paes environmental factors potentially affected the degradation of dehp were characterized further the degrading intermediates of dehp were analyzed through ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uhplc

2 7 simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phthalic acid esters from municipal wastewater wastewater was collected from xiashan municipal wastewater plant zhanjiang china and the detailed

number 62401 the 16s rrna gene of strain rl gz01 has been deposited in genbank with accession number op320921 genome information for the chromosome and plasmids of strain rl gz01 were deposited in genbank under the accession numbers cp103308 cp103309 cp103310 and cp103311 respectively 3 result and discussion 3 1 strain rl gz01 capable of degrading dehp and removing nitrogen and phosphate one bacterium rl gz01 exhibited the capability of utilizing dehp for cell growth was obtained from the sediment samples and 100 mg l of dehp was entirely eliminated within 24 h with a significant increase of od600 value fig 2a however the cell growth was relatively lagging behind the degradation of dehp meanwhile the nitrogen removal performance of strain rl gz01 was presented in fig 2 when nh4 2so4 was supplied as the sole nitrogen source no obvious lag phase of cell growth was observed and 95 6 of nh4 n was reduced with a maximum removal rate of 2 85 mg l h between 24 h and 36 h fig 2b with a short time 12h lag phase no3 n and no2 n were rapidly removed between 24 h and 48 h and the removal percentages were 93 8 and 94 4 within 72 h respectively fig 2c and d phosphate could be rapidly removed by strain rl gz01 with 91 5 removal percentages 84 h and a maximum removal rate of 0 43 mg l h between 48 h and 60 h the colony morphology of strain rl gz01 on the lb solid plate was round orange colored sheeny opaque prominent smooth on the surface and with regular edges fig 3a the scanning electron microscope sem image showed that strain rl gz01 was rod shaped without flagellum fig 3b the 16s rrna gene sequence of strain rl gz01 was amplified and sequenced with a length of 1484 bp the phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna gene indicated that strain rl gz01 has the closest relationship with the species of rhodococcus pyridinovorans fig 3c the physio biochemical properties of strain rl gz01 were presented in table s6 the ani value between the genome of rl gz01 and reference genome of rhodococcus pyridinivorans nc 023150 is 98 68 fig s1 consequently strain rl gz01 was identified as rhodococcus pyridinivorans based on 16s rrna gene analysis physio biochemical characterization and ani calculation the genus rhodococcus is a phylogenetically and catabolically diverse group that are frequent components of microbial communities in diverse natural environments including polar and alpine regions 22 numerous strains of rhodococcus spp were isolated for their versatility to decompose a wide range of natural and synthetic organic compounds 22 species rhodococcus pyridinivorans is known as pyridine degrading bacterium and several xenobiotics degrading strains of rhodococcus pyridinivorans have been reported table 1 among these strains rhodococcus pyridinivorans xb and rhodococcus pyridinovorans dnhp s2 were identified as paes degrading isolates 33 34 although rhodococcus pyridinovorans has been recognized as robust xenobiotics degrader its ability to simultaneously remove emerging pollutants and n p nutrients is rarely reported as well as its application in wastewater treatment 3 2 characterization of strain rl gz01 paes consist of dozens of compounds and are distinguished by the side chains the substrate profile assay suggested that strain rl gz01 is able to completely degrade all the selected paes within 24 h fig 4a including typical short side chain paes dep and dbp long side chain paes dnop and dehp complex side chain paes bbp and circular side chain dchp the results also suggested that the complete degradation of dep is faster than the others as the complete degradation of dehp was done in 12 h therefore we speculate that the steric effect of side chains might affect the degradation efficiency of paes which is in consist with known reports 35 36 strain rl gz01 could degrade dehp under a wide range of ph although the data shown that strain rl gz01 preferred the alkaline environments fig 4b as shown in fig 4b 100 mg l of dehp could be completely degraded within 18 h under ph 8 0 which was therefore the optimal ph dehp degradation by strain rl gz01 was significantly inhibited under ph 4 0 and 5 0 while 100 mg l of dehp could be completely degraded from ph 9 0 to 10 0 within 72 h as to the influences of temperature the concentration of dehp were presented in fig 4c and the results suggested that relatively low 10 c or relatively high 50 c temperature was unfavorable for dehp degradation the optimal incubation temperature is 30 c since 100 mg l of dehp could be completely degraded within 24 h under 30 c while it took 60 h and 72 h for 20 c and 40 c respectively further strain rl gz01 showed good tolerance of environmental salinity fig 4d when the salinity was increased to 4 0 no significant inhibiting effects was observed and 100 mg l of dehp was completely degraded by strain rl gz01 within 36 h although the degradation of dehp was slowdown under salinities 6 0 and 8 0 the complete degradation of 100 mg l of dehp was still accomplished within 72 h this is probably because strain rl gz01 was isolated from intertidal sediments of where bacteria are acclimatized to saline environment the abilities of strain rl gz01 to degrade dehp under the stress of toxic organic solvents were determined fig 4e although the selected organic solvents could inhibit the degradation of dehp to some content 100 mg l of dehp could be completely degraded for all treatments within 72 h specifically limited effects of ethyl acetate and toluene were observed since 100 mg l of dehp was completely removed within 48 h while it took a longer time for the treatments of p xylene 60 h and biphenyl 72 h finally the degradation of dehp under ph 8 0 and 30 c was applied to kinetics analysis and the data shown that strain rl gz01 mediated dehp degradation followed the modified gompertz model r2 0 9985 better compared with the first order decay model r2 0 8689 the best fitted curve for dehp degradation was shown in fig 4f the fitted curves and related parameters for the first order decay model were shown in fig s2 the kinetics analysis demonstrated that rl gz01is able to degrade dehp with a vm of 28 21 mg l h and a lag phase of 5 34 h it is widely accepted that the isolation of novel xenobiotics degrading bacteria is significant for the bioremediation of polluted sites and wastewater treatment in addition the application potential of isolated strains is mainly depended on their degrading efficiency and environmental adaptability the capability of degrading different paes is highly important for paes degrading isolates since a range of paes co exist in the real environment although strain rl gz01 could efficiently degrade different types of paes the results also suggested that the side chains in paes could hinder the degradation efficiency which is consist with known studies 37 38 and the steric effect of long or complex side chain might be the reason 7 35 36 to our knowledge most of the known paes degrading isolates showed preference to neutral or alkaline environments such as arthrobacter sp zh2 gordonia alkanivorans strain yc rl2 and rhodococcus ruber yc yt1 39 41 rl gz01 exhibited tolerance to high salinity and could efficiently degrade dehp with salinities ranging from 2 0 to 8 0 dehp degradation was completely inhibited until the salinity reached 10 0 several salt tolerant paes degrading been reported and they were mainly isolated from salinity environments such as marine plastic debris intertidal and mangrove sediments 17 41 the characteristics of salt tolerance is unique and critical for the bioremediation of saline wastewater and sediments the tolerance of solvents has also been recognized as important characteristics of microbial based remediation especially for the elimination of hydrophobic compounds 18 the solvent tolerant mechanisms of strain rl gz01 might be illustrated in our future works kinetics analysis has been extensively used to simulate the degrading process and evaluate the degradation efficiencies of different isolates 20 for the most studies of metabolic kinetics the modified gompertz model and the first order decay model were widely used while the modified gompertz model was found to be more applicable to the degradation with lag phase 17 38 42 3 3 metabolic pathway of dehp in strain rl gz01 the proposed metabolic pathway of dehp in strain rl gz01 was presented in fig 5 and the data of metabolic intermediates was shown in table s7 and fig s3 all these compounds were undetectable after 72 h which indicated that they were entirely utilized by strain rl gz01 according to the identification of metabolic intermediates we found that rl gz01 could transform the long side chain pae dehp into short side chain pae dep prior to ester bond hydrolyzation the reduction of side chain in dehp was always accomplished by β oxidation while the transformation of dep to pa was achieved through step by step hydrolyzation further phthalic acid was converted into catechol via benzoate while catechol was exploited for cell growth via the catechol branch of the β ketoadipate pathway the metabolic pathways of paes have been systematically investigated and the process is consisted of two major steps i transformation of paes into phthalic acid and ii utilization of phthalic acid 7 some strains were capable of hydrolyzing the ester bonds directly and generating pa thereafter such as mycobacterium sp yc rl4 gordonia terrae rl jc02 and halomonas sp atbc28 38 43 44 some other strains could reduce the side chain s length prior to ester bond hydrolyzation 45 although most isolates are able to transform paes into pa some of these are incapable of utilizing pa for growth such as gordonia sp jdc 2 and camelimonas sp m11 37 46 phthalic acid is the main intermediates of paes degradation the catabolic pathway of pa has been extensively investigated while pa might be transformed into some certain intermediates like pca benzoate catechol and gentisate subsequently these intermediates could be utilized for cell growth via specific metabolic pathway 7 particularly the reduction of side chain length should be significant for paes degradation even though the related studies were still limited two reasons for this viewpoint i the reduction of side chain length could extinguish the steric hinerance effects of long or complex side chains and make full utilization of side chains for growth at the same time ii the recognition of side chain toxicity was underrepresented while some of these side chains are known to be more toxic and be more recalcitrant for biodegradation such as 2 ethylhexanol side chain of dehp 47 48 thus strain rl gz01 should be recognized as an environment friendly bacterial strain for bioremediation and wastewater treatment 3 4 molecular mechanisms of dehp metabolism nitrogen and phosphate removal the genome of strain rl gz01 comprises a circular chromosome 4 948 512 bp g c content 68 04 one linear plasmid pgz01 236 455 bp g c content 64 98 and two circular plasmids pgz02 100 921 bp g c content 63 92 pgz03 87 329 bp g c content 65 48 the circular map of genome and plasmids was shown in fig s4 in total 5081 genes have been predicted in the chromosome and plasmids of strain rl gz01 among these genes 4988 of protein coding genes cdss and 93 of rna genes 12 rrna genes 55 trna genes and 26 ncrna genes were predicted functional categorization of cdss were performed with eggnog database and the results shown that 4235 84 9 of the predicted cdss were assigned to the eggnog function classification fig s5 the top three classifications with known function were transcription 357 8 33 energy production and conversion 284 6 62 and replication recombination and repair 269 6 27 the alignment of predicted cdss with kegg database revealed that 1973 of genes were involved in 112 pathways the kegg nitrogen metabolism pathway analysis demonstrated that ammonium was removed by assimilation while nitrate and nitrite were removed by ammonification and assimilation fig 5 the genes and gene clusters potentially contributed to the metabolism of dehp nitrogen and phosphate are listed in table 2 the extracellular nitrate and nitrite could be transferred into the cells with the assistance of nitrate and nitrite transporter nart while ammonium was transferred by ammonium transporter amt nitrate was transformed into nitrite by respiratory nitrate reductase narghij while nitrite was further transformed into ammonium through nitrite reductase nirbd ammonium was used for the biosynthesis of l glutamine and l glutamate via glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase respectively in addition cat gene cluster contributed to the catechol branch of β ketoadipate pathway was identified according to kegg annotation as to the hydrolyzation of ester bonds of paes a mono alkyl phthalates hydrolase gene mehph was identified through local blast while the gene involved in the transformation of paes to mono alkyl phthalates maps was still unknown for the removal of phosphate genes involved in the sensing and accumulating of environmental inorganic phosphate were identified via genome annotation and local blast analysis the pho regulon integrates the sensing of environmental inorganic phosphate pi availability with coregulation of gene expression mediating an adaptive response to pi concentration 49 phosphate transport system regulatory protein phou could regulate the transport of extracellular phosphate into cells while the transportation was mediated by a low affinity inorganic phosphate transporter pit two poly phosphate kinases ppk and ppk2 and an exopolyphosphatase ppx were identified via genome annotation ppk could catalyze the reversible transfer of the terminal phosphate of atp to form a long chain polyphosphate poly p while ppx could catalyze the liberation of phosphate from polyphosphate 50 polyphosphate glucokinase ppgk could catalyze the phosphorylation of glucose using poly p as the phosphoryl donor the phosphorylation of glucose plays a significant role in the creation of intermediates for oligosaccharide synthesis biological nitrogen removal has been recognized as the most efficient and economical approach for nitrogen removal great efforts have been made on the isolation of functional microorganisms investigation of related mechanisms and application in wastewater treatment investigations mainly focused on ammonium removal through heterotrophic nitrification by which ammonium can be oxidized to nitrate via nitrite nitrate could supply as the electronic receptor and generate nitrogen containing gas via aerobic denitrification pathways 51 although nitrogen is one of the crucial factors for cell growth the investigation of nitrogen removal via ammonium assimilation is still underrepresented while some recent works have demonstrated that heterotrophic ammonium assimilation should be considered as one of the major driving forces for aerobic denitrification 52 meanwhile study has demonstrated that α ketoglutarate generated by carbon source metabolism is an important substrate for glutamate biosynthesis since α ketoglutarate provides a carbon skeleton for microbial ammonium assimilation 53 for the simultaneous elimination of dehp and nitrogen by strain rl gz01 carbon source provided by dehp could be supplied as carbon skeleton and used for the biosynthesis of glutamate with ammonium furthermore it has been reported that some heterotrophic denitrifiers can store polyphosphate under either aerobic anoxic conditions 14 54 55 these microbes are termed as denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms dpaos and are able to derive energy from utilization of external carbon sources unlike paos 56 hence strain rl gz01 can be defined as a typical dpao which could simultaneously remove nitrogen and phosphorus by the utilization of external carbon sources dehp and other organic compounds consequently facilitating cod bod removal and dehp elimination as well owing to its ability to simultaneously remove paes nitrogen and phosphate strain rl gz01 has great application potential in the treatment of paes containing wastewater 3 5 simultaneous removal of nitrogen phosphate and dehp from municipal wastewater to evaluate the potential of strain rl gz01 in wastewater treatment the simultaneous removal of nitrogen phosphate and dehp from municipal wastewater was conducted fig 6 as shown in table s4 the total nitrogen content 74 51 mg l in municipal wastewater was mainly due to nh4 n 70 91 mg l while the concentration of po4 3 p and cod value of wastewater were 10 89 mg l and 622 4 mg l respectively the concentration of dehp in original wastewater was detected as 0 13 mg l and additional dehp was supplemented with a final concentration of 5 17 mg l after 84 h of treatment concentrations of tn and nh4 n were 50 31 mg l and 49 77 mg l in the wastewater of control treatment when strain rl gz01 was inoculated into the wastewater the residual concentrations of tn and nh4 n were reduced to 4 40 mg l and 3 72 mg l respectively the cod value showed similar tendency with tn and nh4 n specifically no obvious changes of po4 3 p concentration was observed in the control treatment while the concentration of po4 3 p was reduced to 2 58 mg l with inoculation of strain rl gz01 meanwhile after inoculation of strain rl gz01 dehp 5 17 mg l in the wastewater was completely degraded while the dehp concentration in the control treatment was decreased to 4 65 mg l after 36 h since the concentration of no3 n and no2 n were very low their contribution to tn and cod was limited and therefore insignificant thus the total removal percentages of dehp tn nh4 n po4 3 p and cod in municipal wastewater were 100 93 82 94 75 76 3 and 83 77 while the strain rl gz01 accounted for 89 94 64 45 64 94 76 30 and 63 23 respectively these results also indicated that some indigenous microbes in municipal wastewater might be involved in the removal of dehp and nitrogen overall strain rl gz01 exhibited excellent dehp nitrogen and phosphate removal ability in the treatment of dehp containing municipal wastewater as that in the test media to improve existing wastewater treatment systems the opportunities is to develop biological treatment processes for the concurrent removal of conventional pollutants essentially nitrogen and phosphorus and emerging pollutants most of the existing biological wastewater treatment systems are not designed for the elimination of emerging pollutants the current status highlights the urgent need to develop methods capable of simultaneously removing nutrients and emerging pollutants zhao et al 57 developed intermittently aerated subsurface flow constructed wetlands for the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and dimethyl phthalate from low carbon wastewaters which provided novel insights into dmp removal mechanism and useful guidance for the practical application of constructed wetlands for treating wastewater containing phthalates hong et al 58 reported a novel zn ii resistant pseudomonas stutzeri ky 37 which was capable of eliminating nitrogen and bisphenol a from wastewater at the same time both strain rl gz01 and strain ky 37 can remove nitrogen and emerging pollutants from wastewater specifically strain ky 37 was identified as a zn ii resistance aerobic denitrifier which suggested that strain ky 37 harbored great application potential in some specific situation wastewater contaminated with nitrogen bpa like endocrine disrupting chemicals and metals in contrast strain rl gz01 would be more applicable for the treatment of municipal wastewater since paes has been identified as a widely distributed emerging pollutants in municipal wastewater table s1 gani et al 59 investigated the effects of treatment configuration on the efficient removal of nitrogen and priority paes from municipal wastewater in an integrated biofilm activated sludge system which demonstrated that treatment configuration and f m ratio might be one of the guiding parameters xu et al 60 fabricated a novel biological carrier combining sponge and modified walnut shell biochar with fe3o4 which was used to remove nitrate and dep simultaneously however microbes capable of simultaneously removing paes nitrogen and phosphorus were rarely reported therefore the isolation investigation and application of strain rl gz01 provide novel potential for the treatment of paes containing municipal wastewater 4 conclusions in this study simultaneous removal of nitrogen phosphate and dehp was achieved by strain rhodococcus pyridinivorans rl gz01 strain rl gz01 showed preference to alkaline conditions and good tolerance to salinity and organic solvents the kinetics analysis demonstrated that the metabolism process of dehp in strain rl gz01 was well fitted with the modified gompertz model r2 0 9985 the catabolic pathway of dehp in strain rl gz01 was deduced by metabolites identification prior to de esterification dehp was transformed into di 2 ethyl hexyl phthalate dep via β oxidation while dep was further de esterized into phthalic acid phthalic acid was transformed into catechol via benzoate while catechol was utilized for cell growth through catechol branch of the β ketoadipate pathway genes involved in the degradation of dehp were identified via genome sequencing analysis the kegg nitrogen metabolism pathway indicated that nitrate was transformed into nitrite by a respiratory nitrate reductase while nitrite was further transformed into ammonium through a nitrite reductase ammonium was used for the biosynthesis of l glutamine and l glutamate via glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase respectively strain rl gz01 was further identified as a dpao for its capacity of phosphate accumulation finally the application of strain rl gz01 in municipal wastewater treatment was conducted for simultaneous removal of nitrogen phosphate and dehp the removal percentages of dehp tn nh4 n po4 3 p and cod by strain rl gz01 in municipal wastewater were 89 94 64 45 64 94 76 30 and 63 23 respectively suggesting excellent application potential of rl gz01 in treating paes containing wastewater declaration of competing interest the

12573,microplastics and nanoplastics mnps are emerging water and wastewater pollutants having high toxicity strong affinity to other pollutants solid resilience in water and low rate of degradation while their presence in wastewater causes disturbance in treatment plants nanotechnology based strategies have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in water and wastewater treatment by combating various challenging mnp pollutants with high efficiency this review presents methods that use nanomaterials to enhance the performance of water treatment processes toward removal of mnps adsorption photocatalysis and membrane filtration are the main processes in which nanomaterials can help remediate mnp pollution this is due to the properties of nanomaterials that include high surface to volume ratio tunable surface charges variable functionalities and lower required dosage through recent literature we critically assess property performance relations while challenges and gaps such as quantification impact of other contaminants and consideration of the size and shape of mnps are highlighted process specific considerations and limitations that can trigger further research and development are suggested graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microplastics nanoplastics water treatment nanomaterials removal degradation pollution remediation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global scarcity of water has motivated alternative means of water production including wastewater treatment a class of emerging pollutants detected in several wastewater treatment plants wwtps and other water bodies are microplastics and nanoplastics mnps 1 mnps can generally be defined as plastic particles with sizes of 5 mm produced from sources that include cosmetics clothing industries construction agricultural packaging transportation marine recreational personal cares ink for 3d laser printing and ddetergents 2 nanoplastics nps are of sizes 1 μm however this borderline varies among sources 3 the excessive use of plastics has created a route for the occurrence of these pollutants in the ecosystem for example excessive mask usage during the covid 19 pandemic resulted in the occurrence of large amounts of microplastics mps 4 additionally state of the art analytical methods have made it possible to evaluate the presence of these contaminants in water bodies raising concerns even further mps can exist in two forms primary mps i e of purposely manufactured size or secondary mps i e broken down and fragmented from larger plastic debris both types of mps create a threat to the ecosystem and human health 5 6 mnps can disrupt the operation of freshwater production methods pollute water resources in their natural state or act as vectors in spreading other toxic pollutants through the formation of harmful complexes 5 6 2 they can cause choking or starvation when ingested by marine organisms 7 they can also result in poisoning aquatic biota due to other contaminants they may absorb such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes or heavy metals 8 9 in addition some aquatic species containing this debris may end up consumed by humans thus having adverse impact on human health 10 they were found to be persistent in water bodies wwtps and drinking water treatment plants and disrupt their operation 11 13 their high stability also makes their removal using conventional water treatment methods challenging yet strategies for removal from liquid phase by concentrating them into sludge phase are being applied it should be noted though that sludge from conventional treatment methods often constitutes also a large source of mnps that are released into terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems 14 therefore the development of effective removal methods becomes crucial 6 due to the reasons stated mnps are hence considered pollutants of great concern by the european union eu review in the urban waste water treatment directive uwwtd 3 however while some countries such as usa united kingdom and canada discourage microbead production there are yet to exist any international regulations governing the generation of mnps 15 hence effective removal technologies are needed manipulation of materials at the nanoscale has become possible due to the discovery of various characterization and synthesis techniques 16 this has opened up new possibilities in various fields such as energy electronics and biomedical applications 16 nanotechnology has been reported to make water treatment more efficient affordable effective and durable 17 characteristics such as specific surface area high reactivity high degree of functionalization and size dependent properties give rise to these advantages 17 considering such properties and factors water treatment processes can be manipulated at the molecular or atomic level to target specific pollutants as mnps can be comparable in size to various nanofeatures removal processes can be greatly amplified this review considered a comprehensive assessment of studies that analyzed or synthesized specific nanostructure forms for water mnp remediation whether through size or surface features a thorough overview and comparison between methods is provided and trends are identified and critically evaluated gaps and considerations for future research are also identified 2 overview of applied processes the removal rate of mps in wwtps varies greatly reported to range from 25 to 99 9 depending on the process 18 fig 1 shows the flow of mps in a conventional wwtp pre treatment and primary treatment stages remove a significant amount of the main mps with a size between 1000 and 5000 μm 19 secondary treatment also removes another 0 2 14 possibly due to 1 bacterial or sludge flocs that aid in the accumulation of plastic debris 2 ingestion by protozoa 3 and the addition of chemicals such as coagulants 20 however the exact mechanism for these tasks is not yet clear resulting in a great variation between sources 20 the efficacy of tertiary treatment is highly dependent on the technology thus there is still room for improvement regarding secondary and tertiary treatment in wwtps 21 among the technologies studied and reported for mp remediation are chemical coagulation floatation membrane processes activated sludge process biological anaerobic digestion 22 wet oxidation and advanced oxidation processes aops such as ozonation fenton 23 electro fenton 24 and h2o2 uv 25 adsorption which relies on the transfer of mps from the bulk liquid onto a solid surface is often found effective for microplastic separation 26 another example is chemical coagulation which uses positively charged ions such as al3 and fe3 to separate mps according to differences in solid and fluid density 27 electrocoagulation is a chemical free approach that exploits a sacrificial anode to form in situ coagulants which removes mps from water by up to 98 6 28 biological digestion has also been applied using a variety of microbial strains achieving up to 100 removal for mps ranging from 1 to 90μm 29 however the reduction was found to be sensitive to the size morphology and concentration of the mps and varies significantly from one category of species to another most of the applied methods consider bulk removal of mnps and the role of nanotechnology has not been thoroughly dicussed with regards to mnps nanotechnology plays a central role in water treatment 30 customized nanoscale manipulation can be applied for the engineering of nanomaterials and processes to target mps in water this can be done by firstly understanding the properties of mnps the appropriate nanomaterial properties can then be tuned depending on the size charge and composition of the mnps in general mnps of larger sizes are relatively easy to separate yet removal becomes more challenging as smaller sizes are targeted where nanotechnology can play a vital role hydrophobic interactions and the role of hydrogen bonding are crucial in the separation of mnps mnps are usually hydrophobic due to their organic nature hence hydrophobic surfaces can be considered for drawing them to materials and likewise hydrophilic species can be utilized for their rejection the size of the mps determines the effect of this interaction the negatively charged mnps can also be remediated through electrostatic attraction or repulsion forces other important factors are their long residence time high stability high potential of fragmentation and the adsorption of other contaminants in their vicinity 26 furthermore mnps have a variety of morphologies different densities and concentrations which makes their separation even more challenging on a large scale taking the properties and features into consideration water treatment processes can be manipulated by addition of nanomaterials or other structural nanofeatures that amplify the removal of mps at the molecular or atomic level by surveying literature using several databases such as web of science scopus and sciencedirect and by using keywords including microplastics nanoplastics nanomaterials nanotechnology microplastics remediation microplastics removal nanoplastics removal nanoplastics remediation water treatment wastewater treatment and different combinations of such studies employing nanomaterials to enhance removal processes were identified and studies analyzing or synthesizing a certain form of nanostructure whether through size or surface engineering for mnp remediation from water were considered as well it was first noted that the majority of studies started in 2018 and augmented toward 2022 this shows the emerging impact of mnps and the evolving role of nanotechnology it was also found that the results skewed toward three specific water treatment processes that utilize nanotechnology namely adsorption photocatalytic degradation and membrane technologies adsorption and membrane technologies are considered separation processes whereas photocatalytic degradation is a removal by degradation process hence this review is divided into separation and degradation processes hereafter summaries and trends based on the reviewed papers are analyzed throughout and discussed 3 microplastics remediation nanotechnologies by separation 3 1 adsorption adsorption is a facile sustainable and cost effective water purification technique 31 it is governed by surface phenomena whereby pollutant molecules are attached from the fluid bulk to the solid surface high surface area is one of the most critical factors in determining the overall efficacy of the process nano adsorbents have a highly active specific surface area and porosity which can allow for a significant improvement in the pollutant rejection 32 3 1 1 magnetic nano adsorbents several studies focusing on the development and application of magnetic nano adsorbents have been reported in literature for example grbic et al functionalized iron fe nanoparticles with hexadecyltrimethoxysilane c19h42o3si a long chain silane agent to increase the hydrophobicity of the particles while preserving their magnetic properties and large surface area to extract mps from a solution 33 at least 5 different types of mps were extracted with a removal rate ranging from 78 to 93 the extraction procedure based on magnetic nanoparticles was proven to be efficient for different polymer types ayra et al used a combination of top down and bottom up techniques to prepare nanostructured iron fe powder for mp removal 34 first iron particles were ball milled to the nano size they were then functionalized with lauric acid c12h24o2 to achieve a contact angle of 140 making the particles super hydrophobic and thus suitable for mp adsorption after the nanoparticles were magnetically extracted the nanomaterials were partially recovered by pouring a small amount of water followed by sonication to detach the mps an mp removal rate of up to 100 was achieved via this modification shi et al carried out an extensive study on removing mps of different sizes shapes and concentrations using nano fe3o4 they also studied the removal of mps from river water domestic sewage and natural seawater an average removal rate of 80 was reported when comparing the removal of mps from seawater and ultrapure water the removal rate was higher in ultrapure water 35 this is due to the hydrophobic interactions which were dominant in ultrapure water while electrostatic interactions were dominant in seawater furthermore the presence of ionic cations such as na can also be competitively adsorbed by mps thus suppressing their removal by the adsorbent 35 several other magnetic nanomaterials and composites were utilized and investigated for mp removal such as magnetic carbon nanotubes cnts 36 magnetic polyoxometalate supported ionic liquid phases magpom silps 37 and mg zn modified magnetic biochars 38 39 tang et al used magnetic cnts for the removal of polyethylene terephthalate pet polyamide pa and polyethylene pe from wastewater 36 a kitchen wastewater treatment process achieved a 100 mp removal rate due to the high adsorption capacity up to 1650 mg g and was almost unaffected by the variation in chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and phosphate po4 3 thermal treatment at 600 c was used for adsorbent regeneration with mp removal dropping to approximately 80 36 cnts have large specific surface areas large aspect ratios and are intrinsically hydrophobic therefore they have a high affinity for organic species such as mps the process of cnt fe magnetization has two functions 1 to enhance the removal of the adsorbent nanoparticles from the solution and 2 to allow for the adsorption of both polar and non polar mps the removal mechanism suggested that the removal of pe and pet was mainly due to the strong hydrophobicity however the pa adsorption was due to π π electron interaction complexation electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding on the pa surface 36 wang et al 39 studied the effect of modifying biochar with mg and zn to improve the adsorption capacity and the removal of mp from aqueous solutions the results showed that the positively charged metals enhanced the electrostatic interaction between the adsorbent and the negatively charged mps furthermore the metals acted as a bridge for chemical bonding between the biochar and polystyrene ps allowing for enhanced adsorption pyrolysis was utilized for simultaneous mp degradation and adsorbent regeneration although thermal treatment was sufficient to regenerate the adsorbent mg and zn provided additional catalytic active sites for hydrogenation resulting in more small molecules in liquid products thus enhancing the mp degradation 39 however the efficiency was found to drop upon regeneration i e for mg and zn modified biochar the removal of mps dropped from about 99 to 94 6 and 95 8 respectively after a single cycle furthermore the co existing dihydrogen phosphate ion h2po4 and organic matter in real river water and wastewater also affected the rejection rate 39 polyoxometalate ionic liquid pom il was also synthesized and adsorbed onto the microporous core shell of iron silica fe sio2 nanoparticles resulting in a magnetic nanocomposite magpom silp 37 the removal of mps was tested by dispersing the nanocomposite in an mp suspension and leaving it stirred for 24 h the particles were then removed by a magnet with the mps adsorbed onto them the interaction between magpom silp and ps was studied by scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds after drying the magnetically extracted samples 37 and it was found that the ps beads were attached to the nanocomposite which allowed the former to be removed magnetically hydrophobic interactions between the nanocomposite and the ps beads were the main reason behind this interaction it was also found that the ps aggregation was induced by the nanocomposite overall iron based compounds are generally efficient in mp separation and can be readily regenerated specifically magnetic cnts are among the most promising adsorbents yet large scale production and commercialization studies are still lacking 3 1 2 non magnetic nano adsorbents non magnetic nanomaterials have also been explored yet recollection is even more challenging sun et al conducted a study investigating the removal of carboxylated and aminated mps using chitin c8h13o5n n and graphene oxide go sponges 40 highly adsorptive sponges were used for up to 3 filtration cycles the adsorption kinetics showed that electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonds and π π interactions aided the high adsorption capacity therefore the high removal rate 40 regeneration of the go sponges was carried out by rinsing with ethanol and freeze drying the sponges were found to withstand significant stress and could also be biodegraded by microorganisms in the soil layered double hydroxides ldhs are another example of how nanostructures can enhance mp separation tiwari et al synthesized znal at a size 100 nm and a regular hexagonal structure with an average pore diameter of 1 6 nm 41 the znal zeta potential at ph 4 and 10 was 45 5 and 8 mv respectively while that of ps was 36 8 and 43 4 mv respectively since the removal dropped with increasing ph it was concluded that electrostatic attraction was the dominant mechanism the particles were then removed by sedimentation sem eds analysis showed high carbon content on the surface of the znal ldh because of the accumulation of plastic debris znal ldh became protonated as oh2 groups are on the surface and the negatively charged mps could then be easily adsorbed non magnetic adsorbents are less preferred for mp separtion due to difficulty in reuse which becomes even more difficult in the nano range hence 3d structures such as sponges rather then particles are suggested as a more facile route 3 1 3 nanoplastic remediation by adsorption processes while the utlization of magnetic and non magnetic nano adsorbents for mp separation is commonly studied a limited number of studies use adosrption for np separation a study on different np diameters utilizing iron modified biochar as adsorbent was reported by singh et al 2021 an adsorption capacity of up to 206 46 mg g was reported for carboxyl nps of 30 nm diameter 38 it was found that complexation between the nps and the composite in addition to electrostatic attraction was the reason behind the adsorption process as the diameter drops from 1000 nm to 30 nm it was reported that there is a higher impact on conditions such as ph temperature and competitive ions this could be a possible reason behind the limited number of studies on smaller plastics nps in the context of a circular economy another study utilized functional mesoporous biochar mbc produced from contaminated corncobs in a mining area was reported by zhu et al 2022 for 100 nm size np remediation mbc has properties such as high structural stability specific surface area and high mesoscale porosity the stated properties make mbc a potential adsorbent for polystyrene nps removal from water additionally the contaminated corncobs contain abundant metallic active sites and functional groups that could act as additional adsorption sites to target nps the mbc had a maximum adsorption capacity of 56 mg g and a degradation rate of 100 this is significantly higher than the degradation rate of biochar bc and commercial activated carbon which were found to be 34 5 and 6 9 respectively the mbc is hydrothermally degraded after np adsorption and the adsorbent could effectively be regenerated the metal rich mbc approach could not only effectively remove microplastics but eliminate the heavy metal hazard coming from biomass in a mining area 42 however environmental conditions were not assesed in detail in this study an interesting observation in a study on nps remediation was that the surface area after adsorption was increased as a result of the adsorbed nps on the nanoparticles 41 furthermore gibbs s free energy calculations showed that adsorption is favorable and spontaneous in nature while it was more likely physical which also confirms the theoretical recovery of almost 100 of the nanocomposite due to the absence of chemical bonds 41 it was also found that the rate of adsorption was faster in deionized water di and freshwater 0 9 10 3 m than hardwater 4 10 3 m due to the presence of different ionic species that may compete for the same active sites therefore this study was found to be more suitable for freshwater where other competing ionic species were present in lower concentrations 41 these are consistent with the observatios of singh et al 2021 which report strong dependance of nps adsorption on environmental conditions compared to mps molecular dynamics can be used as an efficient tool to study the interaction between nps and adsorbents in details dettmann et al introduced a fundamental study to investigate the interaction between cnts and nps using course grained molecular dynamics 43 nps were simulated using different hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers and the hydrophobicity of cnts was tuned using functional groups on the inner surface in this study it was shown that nps based on hydrophobic polymers have strong affinity to be captured on both the outer surface and within the cnt 43 the functionalization of cnts had no significant effect on the adsorption of hydrophilic microplastics such as peo however polymers such as pp pe and ps were repelled away from the cooh groups and rather accumulate within the cnt structure the results of the magnetic and non magnetic nano adsorbents used for both mps and nps removal are summarized in table 1 it can be concluded that magnetic nanomaterials constitute a more facile route for the mnp separation by adsorption iron and iron based compounds allow for the easy separation of nanomaterials from the matrices many of these nanomaterials were found to be environmentally friendly economic and efficient the selectivity of nanomaterials can be tuned to enhance the removal of mps mainly by surface treatment techniques e g by making them more hydrophobic and enhancing the surface positive charge it should be noted however that the majority of the reviewed studies are undertaken in the lab with very limited contaminants present wastewater though has a complex matrix with different contaminants such as organics other ions etc the adsorption process will inevitably be impacted by such contaminants and the removal efficiency can be significantly lower in the real situation looking at table 1 for example most studies used di water or synthetic solutions as matrices hence challenges to be further considered include the competition of other ions impurities that can also be adsorbed on the involved surfaces and the regeneration of the involved nanomaterials after the removal cycle 3 2 filtration 3 2 1 commercial nanoporous membranes for mp separation this section focuses on commercial nanoporous membranes and their effectivemess in mp removal industrially applied membrane based water treatment technologies can be classified into reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf mf membranes cannot reject nanoplastics because of their large pore size on the other hand mps can be rejected through ro membranes by size exclusion however ro is energy intensive because of the high pressure requirement furthermore the appearance of larger sized pores and other local membrane imperfections in the module and pipework could result in the loss of membrane integrity 46 uf and nf are the most promising options for mp separation both of these types of membranes have internal nanofeatures because of their pore merits which can range from hundreds of nanometers uf to a few nanometers nf however mps can be detrimental to uf and nf by stimulating microbial activity and particulate accumulation on the membrane surface thus inducing fouling the hydrophobicity of mps could result in increased microbial activity and increased production of extracellular polymeric substances epss in natural surface water 47 specifically trypotophone like soluble microbial byproducts were entrapped in the membrane pores causing severe fouling similar results have also been reported using commercial membranes 48 49 ma et al studied iron based coagulants prior to uf 27 50 in a commercial polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane a pore size of 30 nm was sufficient for mp removal however fouling is still a major obstacle when the mixture was fed with coagulants effective coagulation of mps and hence large floc formation occurred thus larger flocs of pe mps could be rejected at a maximum efficiency of 90 9 in addition to the enhanced removal efficiency membrane fouling was also reduced due to the heterogeneous structure of the cake layer formed by the larger flocs a heterogeneous cake layer can therefore 1 act as an additional sieve and 2 prevent small molecules from getting stuck inside the membrane or attaching to its surface the heterogeneous cake layer can then be effectively backwashed without permanent damage to the membrane hence fouling can be considerably reduced while maintaining a high mp removal efficiency due to iron coagulation 27 3 2 2 nanomaterials in filter media and membrane modification filtration of mps can be achieved using nanoporous membranes and or incorporating nanoparticles within or on the surface of membranes or other filtration systems metal organic frameworks mofs are porous materials consisting of metal centers linked by organic ligands these structures have several unique properties including extended and tunable porosity variable pore functionality and high surface area which make them highly promising for pollutant separation 51 52 chen et al 53 studied the effects of incorporating mofs into melamine foam filters for mp remediation melamine foam is a fluffy porous foam with flexibility robustness and stability making it a suitable substrate the synergetic effect of the two constituents resulted in an effective mp separation the mofs were initially found to have positive zeta potential and hence exhibited enhanced interactions with the mps second mofs were functionalized with various functional groups such as nh2 oh no2 and br a hydroxyl functionalized zirconium based mof zr mof named uio 66 oh resulted in highest removal which shows that hydrogen bonding plays a significant role in the mp separation third the highly porous interconnected mof structure provided a substantial surface area for contact between the mof and the mps finally the high water stability of the functionalized zr mofs combined with the high tensile stress made the removal substantially more efficient in this study the loading of mofs onto melamine was 25 scaling up high cost and agglomeration effects are challenges yet to be addressed for large scale usage of mofs another approach is to incorporate mofs into membranes which results in mixed matrix membranes mmms 52 membrane processes use semi permeable film to allow the separation of pollutants from water and have been studied and applied due to their high separation efficiency low energy consumption and compactness 54 in membrane separation permeability is a critical factor in determining energy consumption and the properties of the membrane surface often determine the separation efficiency 55 gnanasekran et al 56 made polysulfone based mmms by incorporating mil 100 fe by varying the mof concentration it was found that at 0 5 wt a permeability of 72 l m2 h bar was observed for the separation of mp which is 10 3 times higher than that of the pristine polysulfone membrane 56 this was attributed to the hydrophilicity of mil 100 which aided in the formation of a hydration layer on the membrane surface at a higher concentration of mil 100 the hydrophilicity increased but the pore blockage increased as well therefore a loading of 0 5 wt was found to be optimal for the mp separation using dye as a pollutant model using mmms only a small percentage of nanomaterial fillers could enhance the permeability and removal of pollutants such as mps from water the removal of mps using this class of membranes was also studied using reduced graphene oxide rgo 57 the nanoporous structure of rgo was used to fabricate nanocomposite membranes based on polyacrylonitrile pan a flux of up to 323 6 l m2 h was obtained coupled with a removal of 82 at an rgo concentration of 0 83 wt 57 electrospun nanofiber membranes are another possible approach for effective mp separation 58 this is due to their highly porous nature which significantly reduces the energy needed for filtration since they have been employed and found effective for particulate matter removal such as pm10 10 μm pm2 5 2 5 μm and pm1 0 1 μm they have a great potential for effective microplastic separation from water ligand engineering on the spinning solution can be utilized to tune the properties of the nanofiber membranes for enhanced removal 3 2 3 nanoplastic remediation by membrane processes similar to mp np can be rejected by uf and nf membranes however fouling is a larger obstacle in np this is because of entrapping of np inside the membrane pores in the uf interactions between the particles and the surface of the membrane aid in the rejection of mps 59 here the nanofeatures of the pores start to have significant effects for example when the particles and the membrane are both hydrophobic their interaction is expected to be high at the same time when both the membrane and the np particles are negatively charged the particles can be rejected away from the membrane surface 59 the two phenomena counterbalance each other and with time can result in a variation in the membrane performance furthermore fouling is a significant obstacle that hinders long term use especially in np remediation 6 the adsorption stacking and entrapping of nps in and on the membrane surface can result in a major decline in flux 59 so higher pressure is required to compensate for flux losses the need for frequent membrane replacement due to fouling adds cost and raises environmental concerns specifically in np remediation the mechanistic and kinetic aspects of fouling by nps were studied in detail using commercial polysulfone membranes for mps of a size ranging from 13 to 690 nm 59 the fouling by mps occurs in 3 phases fig 2 first intermediate blocking fastest followed by complete blocking and cake layer formation the first step has the highest rate due to the roughness and membrane hydrophobicity once a layer is formed by the interaction between the mps and polysulfone hydrophobic hydrophobic additional layers of mps can stack up immediately initial roughness also enhanced this interaction 59 efficient cleaning procedures novel membrane materials and improved analytical techniques for detecting quantifying and identifying fouling due to mps are critical in the context of novel membrane fabrication layer by layer lbl assembly is a surface modification technique that has been utilized to enhance the permeability of nanoporous membranes for np removal 60 by alternating the assembly of polyethyleneimine pei and poly acrylic acid paa on a hydrolyzed electrospun pan membrane the membrane charge could be tuned and simultaneously the mechanical strength and hydrophilicity of pan could be increased water flux of up to 861 l m2 h was achieved at a pressure of 1 bar an np removal of 89 9 was achieved by involving nano sized ps particles of 50 nm in size the removal was based on pore sieving and electrostatic interactions the positively charged membrane exhibited the highest reduction due to the high mp attraction to the negatively charged ps particles 60 challenges related to this technique include long term stability and the mp concentration threshold when the positive charges on the membrane are neutralized after an extended period or if the mp concentration is too high sieving may not be efficient and thus the removal may be reduced hence sieving still plays a significant role in the removal of mps from water via membrane technology typically the smaller the membrane pore size the higher the chances of mp retention hence enhancing the flux of nanoporous membranes without sacrificing porosity or inducing defects is crucial for the np separation althernatively novel membrane materials such as holey ti3c2tx mxene nanosheets developed by etching co3o4 nanoparticles from ti3c2tx nanosheets can be utilized for high np rejection and fouling mitigation 61 florescent particles of sizes ranging from 80 to 1000 were used as models for nps it was found that h ti3c2tx nanosheets exhibited a planar porous structure with nano holes of 25 nm average diameter the nanoholes provided additional water channels in the mxene based membranes which resulted in notably high fluxes 196 7 l m 2h 1kpa 1 with a simultaneous rejection of up to 99 3 in general size exclusion is dominant in large spherical mps however in nps and in mp fibers where the mnps have similar size to the membrane pores other mechanisms come into play as well these include hydrophobic hydrophilic interactions and electrostatic repulsion attraction table 2 summarizes studies related to the removal of mnps from aqueous environments using uf and nf membranes 4 degradation by advanced oxidation processes 4 1 titania tio2 based photocatalysts advanced oxidation processes aops are efficient for the degradation of organics such as dyes and pharmaceuticals hence can be a promising option for mp removal mps can degrade naturally however their degradation rate is prolonged photocatalysis was found to be the most common aop for mp removal from aqueous environments considering the nano range photocatalysis is based on semiconducting materials such as titania tio2 whose electrons can be excited from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb by exposure to a light source uv or visible light when electrons are excited they cause the generation of reactive oxygen species ros that induce the degradation of mps fig 3 shows the degradation mechanism using ps as a model mp the photocatalytic process is first initiated as shown in step 1 where the photocatalyst gains enough energy from incident light hv to cause electrons to jump from the valence band to the conduction hand hence a hole h is generated in the valence band 63 o2 and h2o are then adsorbed on the tio2 surface step 2 therefore h in the valence band and the e in the conduction band react with these species to form superoxide ion o 2 and hydroxyl oh radicals step 3 oh radicals then produce carbon centered radicals throughout the entire polymer matrix sep 4 63 64 carbon centered radicals then react with o2 to produce peroxide radicals which then react with water to produce alkoxy polymer radicals step 4 63 65 intermediate products such as carbonyl or ketone compounds form which finally complete the photocatalytic oxidation resulting in the formation of co2 and h2o 63 the efficacy of the removal mechanism can vary depending on the size shape and concentration of the mps engineering nanomaterials can enhance the process to increase light absorption expand the wavelength range or change the morphology of the semiconductor 66 nanosized tio2 gained particular interest due to the large surface area to volume ratio ariz tarazona et al 67 who used green synthesis derived from the extrapallial fluid of saltwater mussels conducted a study on high density polyethylene hdpe degradation using n tio2 and compared it to the conventional sol gel method the mussel derived nanostructures exhibited a smaller bandgap redshift and hence they could absorb photons under visible light the properties of the aqueous medium affect the efficiency of the mp degradation process fig 3 shows that the generation of oh is a key step in degradation therefore it is essential that 1 an oxidative medium is present and 2 the recombination of holes and electrons is avoided temperature ph and humidity in the surrounding medium are also factors that influence mp degradation lower temperatures typically increase the surface area of the mps due to fragmentation and lower ph favors the formation of hydroperoxide resulting in higher removal rates 67 humidity is also essential for the mp degradation using semiconductor nanomaterials 67 this is because more water is adsorbed on semiconductor surface fig 3 which means that there is a greater chance of ros oh formation therefore it is not only essential to have oxygenated medium but high adsorption of water on the tio2 as well by studying the effect of the degradation rate on mps using mesoporous tio2 coating it was found that smaller mps had faster degradation rate compared to larger ones due to the high surface area to volume ratio 66 furthermore spherical mps had a higher degradation rate compared to a film due to the increased interaction of bulk and surface bound oh by the diffusion of radicals film shaped mps also led to a poorly oxygenated reaction medium furthermore additional pores in mesoporous tio2 were found to enhance the photocatalytic activity by increasing the oh availability as a result of the increased surface area 66 it should be noted that tio2 nanopowder has high photocatalytic activity however its filtration from the aqueous solution increases the complexity and cost of the overall process on the industrial scale this motivates the use of support materials such as open cell β silicon carbide alveolar foams these materials not only favor light absorption into the material but are thermally and chemically stable 68 4 2 zinc oxide zno photocatalysts zinc oxide zno is another semiconductor of interest in mp removal by aops which has promising photocatalytic properties zno also exhibits high redox potential and electron mobility at room temperature in addition to its antibacterial activity 69 70 tofa et al studied the degradation of low density polyethylene ldpe film in water using zno nanorods 71 it was found that the degree of oxidation was directly related to the surface area of the catalyst this shows the importance of nanoscale materials in increasing the surface area and subsequently increasing the degradation of the mps defect engineering and nano features enhanced mp removal by zno for example the degradation of ldpe in water was investigated using platinum pt nanoparticles deposited on zno nanorods which formed a plasmonic photocatalyst 72 pt is a plasmonic metal which can reduce the recombination of electrons and holes hence increasing the radical formation fig 3 the resonance of interfacial conduction electrons also leads to enhanced light absorption as a result of this modification 73 fig 4 a shows that the addition of pt increased light absorption in the visible region at 385 nm by up to 78 72 a reduction in band to band excitation at 365 nm was also observed due to increased defect intensity in the zno nanorods resulting in enhanced optical adsorption fig 4 b shows a reduction in the radiative recombination of the photogenerated electrons in the pt coated nanorods which results in a higher degree of radical species formation and an increased degradation rate pt nanoparticles therefore act as electron sinks reducing the charge recombination figs 4 c d and e also depict the deeper cavities formed in the ldpe film as a result of the pt coating 72 challenges such as water contamination by nanoparticles and the need for additional filtration and high residence time as a result of the employed batch process need to be further studied novel reactor designs such as those using glass fiber support to allow continuous degradation in a flow through reactor would be needed 74 in such reactors polypropylene pp was degraded using zno nanorods and a continuous increase in the carbonyl index was observed this reactor design opens up new opportunities for scale ups furthermore the antibacterial properties of zno compared to those of other photocatalysts are expected to result in a dual effect of mp degradation and disinfection however mp degradation using zno in a natural wastewater environment has not yet been investigated 4 3 nanoplastic remediation by aops nps are more presistant to remove compared to mps hence additional features and defects may be needed to increase the rate of photocatalytic degradation the effect of the morphology of the photocatalyst on the degradation rate of primary nps has been investigated 63 barrier tubular and mixed tio2 tio2 b tio2 t and tio2 m prepared by anodization were compared fig 5 the formation of tubular and mixed structures shows a redshift hence a smaller bandgap these optical characteristics were resulted from surface defects which favored the separation of charges especially in the multilayer structure tio2 m that exhibited the highest transfer of photogenerated charge carriers thus increasing the rate of degradation of nps additionally other photocatalysts such as copper oxide cu2o cuo were considered for targetting nps 76 cu2o cuo have a bandgap of 2 ev 76 however the related degradation efficiencies vary from 18 to 23 76 despite the low removal rate the study by acuña bedoya et al 76 laid a foundation for the exploration of other photocatalysts these materials can be relatively non expensive non toxic and abundant hence viable in such applications it is concluded that two routes can be taken to achieve effective np separation both relating to reducing the band gap alternative nanomaterials to tio2 can be explored and additional nanofeatures and defects can be implemented it is crucial however to maintain charge separation despite the low bandgap 4 4 other photocatalysts and perspectives reducing the size of the photocatalysts increases the surface area thus increasing the photocatalytic activity 68 77 however reducing the size below the quantum confinement threshold can increase the bandgap of semiconductors blue shift which means their adsorption capability spectrum becomes limited therefore it is critical to fine tune the size and design of semiconductor nanomaterials that are also absorbed in visible light 66 as the surface area of nanoparticles can increase the exposed area to the ros but the blue shift is not desired catalytic oxidation can also be used for mp degradation using graphitic nanomaterials this example was demonstrated by kang et al using functionalized magnetic spring like carbon nanotubes nanosprings fig 4 f l 75 in addition to the robust helical structure the synergistic effect of nitrogen doping and metal encapsulation mn enhanced the catalytic activity and stability of cnts this synergistic effect resulted in a drop in the activation energy of cnts from 106 2 to 87 5 kj mol in mn enhanced carbon nanosprings hence amplifying the catalytic activity as part of this effort the toxicity of the resulting intermediates has also been studied and they have no significant environmental impact a 50 mass reduction was observed using a synthetic mp solution 75 table 3 summarizes studies on the photocatalytic degradation of nps and mps from water using nanomaterials 5 current limitations and future perspectives the removal of mps by the use of nanotechnology is highly gaining potential fig 6 reveals the percentage of studies on mp remediation approaches with respect to mp polymers and shapes it is evident that most of the works deal with ps beads however it is crucial to address fibrous and fragmented mps which are among the most prevalent in wwtps 14 several studies have reported that fibers are among the most difficult mps to remove 3 while they are also expected to have the highest toxicity 26 in membrane technology fibers were found to pass longitudinally through membrane pores thus limiting the removal efficiency 81 this is also a challenge faced in other high pressure processes including ro despite its small cutoff size 46 in particular ps and pe are the most abundant and complex species to remove from water bodies 14 however some mps are also present in wwtps such as polyurethane pur 18 that have not been systematically studied furthermore mps are rarely present in their pure form in wwtps because various additives such as plasticizers flame retardants and pigments are added to them during manufacture 18 they can also adsorb heavy metals pahs and other pharmaceuticals this factor is not considered in the removal studies finally the presence of salts and other species can disrupt mp removal 35 39 thus the matrix mp nature size and shape affect the molecular interactions at the nanoscale and hence sensitivity studies are crucial to assess the efficacy of the proposed method while a natural wastewater environment needs to be simulated as well the process specific benefits and limitations of various nanotechnology features to enhance photocatalytic degradation adsorption and membrane efficiency are summarized in table 4 for adsorption the principal advantage that nanomaterials can bring about is the improved surface area yet a challenging factor is regeneration the loss of mps adsorption capacity was common in many of the reported studies in this review this can be associated with the high hydrophobic interactions between the engineered adsorbent and mps making their dissociation challenging some active sites remain blocked even with high thermal treatment limiting the adsorbents regeneration capacity it is suggested that an ideal adsorption material would be stimuli responsive thus swinging from hydrophobic to hydrophilic by changing the environment condition the material should be superhydrophobic for mp capture and hydrophilic for release with minimal energy consumption this could possibly be achieved using smart thermo responsive materials nanomaterials tunability and functionalization capabilities at the molecular level can facilitate this goal additionally studies on mnps rarely include the effect of competing ions in the water matrix synthetic solutions rather than real water or wastewater are usually tested in this review it is shown that the adsorption matrix becomes highly crucial for nps compared to mps where factors such as ion concentration significantly reduce the adsorption capacity and selectivity for smaller plastic fragments hence for future studies on nps it is crucial to study different water matrices and compare the effect of different ions and ultimately test using real water and wastewater samples nanoporous membranes have resulted in effective mp separation mainly by size exclusion however due to the high hydrophobicity of mps severe fouling on the membrane surface can occur membrane modifications such as mmms have been employed involving various nanofillers and surface coatings utilizing various nanoparticles to tune the surface charge and hydrophilicity to mitigate fouling a small percentage of nanofillers in mmms can result in higher flux and mnp removal additionally nanofibrous membranes have been suggested as an effective route to enhanced mnps remediation in np separation for example size exclusion is not the only mechanism but the role of surface charge and hydrophilicity is critical as well advanced membranes based on 2 d materials such as rgo and mxenes have been found effective for np remediation with lower energy requirement positively charged membranes have resulted in high np separation yet they also attract other negatively charged species such as organics hence for np separation it is preferable to have negatively charged super hydrophilic membranes to repel nps and accelerate water transport across the membrane for photocatalytic degradation it is reported that the increase in the surface area enhances light absorption and surface reactions this can be achieved through the involvement of 1 nanoparticulate photocatalysts and or 2 the introduction of defects nanomaterials were also designed to limit the recombination of electrons and holes exciton thus increasing the exciton stability however a major limitation is the filtration of nanomaterials after usage foam supports were used as a solution to this another major limitation with nanomaterials is the increase in the bandgap size blue shift which limits the absorption wavelength range it is preferable to design nanomaterials to absorb in the visible region to avoid mp fragmentation it should also be noted that studies on mnps take place under different experimental conditions employing various means of quantitative analysis for example for photocatalytic degradation carbonyl index 71 79 turbidity 63 mass loss 77 or total organic carbon toc 68 have been used making a direct comparison of the removal efficiencies challenging therefore it is crucial to design a standard set of conditions and methods for mp quantification especially for photocatalytic degradation additionally a clear quantification method is needed to distinguish between degradation and complete mineralization photocatalysis can result in partial degradation of mnps which may raise concerns related to downstream composition thus ensuring complete mineralization is crucial also it is suggested that hybrid technologies combining photocatalysis and separation technologies need to be systematically explored to ensure complete removal if the latter is not achieved solely by the photocatalytic degradation stage one challenge of the engineered nanomaterials for water and wastewater treatment is their possible ecotoxicity several toxicological studies have shown that nanoparticles could have detrimental effects on most organisms especially at high concentrations 84 therefore additional leaching and toxicology studies need to be systematically performed when nanoparticles are used in any wastewater treatment process risk management studies have also become critical in addition cost analysis is also important with respect to both synthesis of the nanostructures as well as process economics and operation molecular dynamics can also play an important role in studying the mechanisms at the nanoscale for the processes under development and hence can aid in predicting optimal conditions another challenge in implementing nanotechnology for mnp remediation is large scale production studies to pave the way toward pilot and industrial scale implementation are therefore needed 6 conclusions mnps remediation using nanotechnology enhanced methods was reviewed the number of investigations is steadily increasing with reported studies focusing mainly on adsorption membrane technologies and photocatalysis the main outcomes are summarized below mnp adsorption using magnetic nanomaterials is highly promising and has been facilitated mainly by tuning the surface properties of iron and iron oxide based particles through functionalization to increase hydrophobicity regeneration which is hindered by the high hydrophobicity of the mnps is a challenging issue and needs further investigation when nps are considered the water matrix plays a larger role compared to that in mps hence optimization of the adsorbents in a real water or wastewater environment needs to be considered as a future direction photocatalytic degradation using nanocatalysts has been also well studied as it decomposes the mnps however the fate of byproducts of mnps is not thoroughly investigated nanocatalysts can be tuned to increase the surface area enhance light absorption improve electron hole separation and increase surface reactions yet fragmentation of mnps can occur when uv light is used as a light source so visible light is often preferred in addition the degradation rate needs to be further increased from the current maximum of up to 80 reported by most studies as to achieve a competitive advantage for large scale application hybrid degradation separation technologies need also to be sytematically explored as an alternative route to ensure removal when complete degradation is not achieved nanoporous membranes mmms with nanofillers dispersed in the membrane matrix and membranes coated with nanostructured films are also efficient strategies among other improvements in key performance indicators these modifications have been shown to reduce membrane fouling and increase mnp flux and separation fabrication methods to produce materials such as novel electrospun nanofibers and 2d structures such as mxenes are needed as these materials can be effective toward separation of even resellient nps finally standardization of quantitative techniques for the detection and treatment of mnps is required and studies under real wastewater conditions and solution compositions with different matrices shapes sizes and compositions of mnps need to be systematically investigated declaration of competing interest the

12573,microplastics and nanoplastics mnps are emerging water and wastewater pollutants having high toxicity strong affinity to other pollutants solid resilience in water and low rate of degradation while their presence in wastewater causes disturbance in treatment plants nanotechnology based strategies have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in water and wastewater treatment by combating various challenging mnp pollutants with high efficiency this review presents methods that use nanomaterials to enhance the performance of water treatment processes toward removal of mnps adsorption photocatalysis and membrane filtration are the main processes in which nanomaterials can help remediate mnp pollution this is due to the properties of nanomaterials that include high surface to volume ratio tunable surface charges variable functionalities and lower required dosage through recent literature we critically assess property performance relations while challenges and gaps such as quantification impact of other contaminants and consideration of the size and shape of mnps are highlighted process specific considerations and limitations that can trigger further research and development are suggested graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microplastics nanoplastics water treatment nanomaterials removal degradation pollution remediation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global scarcity of water has motivated alternative means of water production including wastewater treatment a class of emerging pollutants detected in several wastewater treatment plants wwtps and other water bodies are microplastics and nanoplastics mnps 1 mnps can generally be defined as plastic particles with sizes of 5 mm produced from sources that include cosmetics clothing industries construction agricultural packaging transportation marine recreational personal cares ink for 3d laser printing and ddetergents 2 nanoplastics nps are of sizes 1 μm however this borderline varies among sources 3 the excessive use of plastics has created a route for the occurrence of these pollutants in the ecosystem for example excessive mask usage during the covid 19 pandemic resulted in the occurrence of large amounts of microplastics mps 4 additionally state of the art analytical methods have made it possible to evaluate the presence of these contaminants in water bodies raising concerns even further mps can exist in two forms primary mps i e of purposely manufactured size or secondary mps i e broken down and fragmented from larger plastic debris both types of mps create a threat to the ecosystem and human health 5 6 mnps can disrupt the operation of freshwater production methods pollute water resources in their natural state or act as vectors in spreading other toxic pollutants through the formation of harmful complexes 5 6 2 they can cause choking or starvation when ingested by marine organisms 7 they can also result in poisoning aquatic biota due to other contaminants they may absorb such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes or heavy metals 8 9 in addition some aquatic species containing this debris may end up consumed by humans thus having adverse impact on human health 10 they were found to be persistent in water bodies wwtps and drinking water treatment plants and disrupt their operation 11 13 their high stability also makes their removal using conventional water treatment methods challenging yet strategies for removal from liquid phase by concentrating them into sludge phase are being applied it should be noted though that sludge from conventional treatment methods often constitutes also a large source of mnps that are released into terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems 14 therefore the development of effective removal methods becomes crucial 6 due to the reasons stated mnps are hence considered pollutants of great concern by the european union eu review in the urban waste water treatment directive uwwtd 3 however while some countries such as usa united kingdom and canada discourage microbead production there are yet to exist any international regulations governing the generation of mnps 15 hence effective removal technologies are needed manipulation of materials at the nanoscale has become possible due to the discovery of various characterization and synthesis techniques 16 this has opened up new possibilities in various fields such as energy electronics and biomedical applications 16 nanotechnology has been reported to make water treatment more efficient affordable effective and durable 17 characteristics such as specific surface area high reactivity high degree of functionalization and size dependent properties give rise to these advantages 17 considering such properties and factors water treatment processes can be manipulated at the molecular or atomic level to target specific pollutants as mnps can be comparable in size to various nanofeatures removal processes can be greatly amplified this review considered a comprehensive assessment of studies that analyzed or synthesized specific nanostructure forms for water mnp remediation whether through size or surface features a thorough overview and comparison between methods is provided and trends are identified and critically evaluated gaps and considerations for future research are also identified 2 overview of applied processes the removal rate of mps in wwtps varies greatly reported to range from 25 to 99 9 depending on the process 18 fig 1 shows the flow of mps in a conventional wwtp pre treatment and primary treatment stages remove a significant amount of the main mps with a size between 1000 and 5000 μm 19 secondary treatment also removes another 0 2 14 possibly due to 1 bacterial or sludge flocs that aid in the accumulation of plastic debris 2 ingestion by protozoa 3 and the addition of chemicals such as coagulants 20 however the exact mechanism for these tasks is not yet clear resulting in a great variation between sources 20 the efficacy of tertiary treatment is highly dependent on the technology thus there is still room for improvement regarding secondary and tertiary treatment in wwtps 21 among the technologies studied and reported for mp remediation are chemical coagulation floatation membrane processes activated sludge process biological anaerobic digestion 22 wet oxidation and advanced oxidation processes aops such as ozonation fenton 23 electro fenton 24 and h2o2 uv 25 adsorption which relies on the transfer of mps from the bulk liquid onto a solid surface is often found effective for microplastic separation 26 another example is chemical coagulation which uses positively charged ions such as al3 and fe3 to separate mps according to differences in solid and fluid density 27 electrocoagulation is a chemical free approach that exploits a sacrificial anode to form in situ coagulants which removes mps from water by up to 98 6 28 biological digestion has also been applied using a variety of microbial strains achieving up to 100 removal for mps ranging from 1 to 90μm 29 however the reduction was found to be sensitive to the size morphology and concentration of the mps and varies significantly from one category of species to another most of the applied methods consider bulk removal of mnps and the role of nanotechnology has not been thoroughly dicussed with regards to mnps nanotechnology plays a central role in water treatment 30 customized nanoscale manipulation can be applied for the engineering of nanomaterials and processes to target mps in water this can be done by firstly understanding the properties of mnps the appropriate nanomaterial properties can then be tuned depending on the size charge and composition of the mnps in general mnps of larger sizes are relatively easy to separate yet removal becomes more challenging as smaller sizes are targeted where nanotechnology can play a vital role hydrophobic interactions and the role of hydrogen bonding are crucial in the separation of mnps mnps are usually hydrophobic due to their organic nature hence hydrophobic surfaces can be considered for drawing them to materials and likewise hydrophilic species can be utilized for their rejection the size of the mps determines the effect of this interaction the negatively charged mnps can also be remediated through electrostatic attraction or repulsion forces other important factors are their long residence time high stability high potential of fragmentation and the adsorption of other contaminants in their vicinity 26 furthermore mnps have a variety of morphologies different densities and concentrations which makes their separation even more challenging on a large scale taking the properties and features into consideration water treatment processes can be manipulated by addition of nanomaterials or other structural nanofeatures that amplify the removal of mps at the molecular or atomic level by surveying literature using several databases such as web of science scopus and sciencedirect and by using keywords including microplastics nanoplastics nanomaterials nanotechnology microplastics remediation microplastics removal nanoplastics removal nanoplastics remediation water treatment wastewater treatment and different combinations of such studies employing nanomaterials to enhance removal processes were identified and studies analyzing or synthesizing a certain form of nanostructure whether through size or surface engineering for mnp remediation from water were considered as well it was first noted that the majority of studies started in 2018 and augmented toward 2022 this shows the emerging impact of mnps and the evolving role of nanotechnology it was also found that the results skewed toward three specific water treatment processes that utilize nanotechnology namely adsorption photocatalytic degradation and membrane technologies adsorption and membrane technologies are considered separation processes whereas photocatalytic degradation is a removal by degradation process hence this review is divided into separation and degradation processes hereafter summaries and trends based on the reviewed papers are analyzed throughout and discussed 3 microplastics remediation nanotechnologies by separation 3 1 adsorption adsorption is a facile sustainable and cost effective water purification technique 31 it is governed by surface phenomena whereby pollutant molecules are attached from the fluid bulk to the solid surface high surface area is one of the most critical factors in determining the overall efficacy of the process nano adsorbents have a highly active specific surface area and porosity which can allow for a significant improvement in the pollutant rejection 32 3 1 1 magnetic nano adsorbents several studies focusing on the development and application of magnetic nano adsorbents have been reported in literature for example grbic et al functionalized iron fe nanoparticles with hexadecyltrimethoxysilane c19h42o3si a long chain silane agent to increase the hydrophobicity of the particles while preserving their magnetic properties and large surface area to extract mps from a solution 33 at least 5 different types of mps were extracted with a removal rate ranging from 78 to 93 the extraction procedure based on magnetic nanoparticles was proven to be efficient for different polymer types ayra et al used a combination of top down and bottom up techniques to prepare nanostructured iron fe powder for mp removal 34 first iron particles were ball milled to the nano size they were then functionalized with lauric acid c12h24o2 to achieve a contact angle of 140 making the particles super hydrophobic and thus suitable for mp adsorption after the nanoparticles were magnetically extracted the nanomaterials were partially recovered by pouring a small amount of water followed by sonication to detach the mps an mp removal rate of up to 100 was achieved via this modification shi et al carried out an extensive study on removing mps of different sizes shapes and concentrations using nano fe3o4 they also studied the removal of mps from river water domestic sewage and natural seawater an average removal rate of 80 was reported when comparing the removal of mps from seawater and ultrapure water the removal rate was higher in ultrapure water 35 this is due to the hydrophobic interactions which were dominant in ultrapure water while electrostatic interactions were dominant in seawater furthermore the presence of ionic cations such as na can also be competitively adsorbed by mps thus suppressing their removal by the adsorbent 35 several other magnetic nanomaterials and composites were utilized and investigated for mp removal such as magnetic carbon nanotubes cnts 36 magnetic polyoxometalate supported ionic liquid phases magpom silps 37 and mg zn modified magnetic biochars 38 39 tang et al used magnetic cnts for the removal of polyethylene terephthalate pet polyamide pa and polyethylene pe from wastewater 36 a kitchen wastewater treatment process achieved a 100 mp removal rate due to the high adsorption capacity up to 1650 mg g and was almost unaffected by the variation in chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and phosphate po4 3 thermal treatment at 600 c was used for adsorbent regeneration with mp removal dropping to approximately 80 36 cnts have large specific surface areas large aspect ratios and are intrinsically hydrophobic therefore they have a high affinity for organic species such as mps the process of cnt fe magnetization has two functions 1 to enhance the removal of the adsorbent nanoparticles from the solution and 2 to allow for the adsorption of both polar and non polar mps the removal mechanism suggested that the removal of pe and pet was mainly due to the strong hydrophobicity however the pa adsorption was due to π π electron interaction complexation electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding on the pa surface 36 wang et al 39 studied the effect of modifying biochar with mg and zn to improve the adsorption capacity and the removal of mp from aqueous solutions the results showed that the positively charged metals enhanced the electrostatic interaction between the adsorbent and the negatively charged mps furthermore the metals acted as a bridge for chemical bonding between the biochar and polystyrene ps allowing for enhanced adsorption pyrolysis was utilized for simultaneous mp degradation and adsorbent regeneration although thermal treatment was sufficient to regenerate the adsorbent mg and zn provided additional catalytic active sites for hydrogenation resulting in more small molecules in liquid products thus enhancing the mp degradation 39 however the efficiency was found to drop upon regeneration i e for mg and zn modified biochar the removal of mps dropped from about 99 to 94 6 and 95 8 respectively after a single cycle furthermore the co existing dihydrogen phosphate ion h2po4 and organic matter in real river water and wastewater also affected the rejection rate 39 polyoxometalate ionic liquid pom il was also synthesized and adsorbed onto the microporous core shell of iron silica fe sio2 nanoparticles resulting in a magnetic nanocomposite magpom silp 37 the removal of mps was tested by dispersing the nanocomposite in an mp suspension and leaving it stirred for 24 h the particles were then removed by a magnet with the mps adsorbed onto them the interaction between magpom silp and ps was studied by scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds after drying the magnetically extracted samples 37 and it was found that the ps beads were attached to the nanocomposite which allowed the former to be removed magnetically hydrophobic interactions between the nanocomposite and the ps beads were the main reason behind this interaction it was also found that the ps aggregation was induced by the nanocomposite overall iron based compounds are generally efficient in mp separation and can be readily regenerated specifically magnetic cnts are among the most promising adsorbents yet large scale production and commercialization studies are still lacking 3 1 2 non magnetic nano adsorbents non magnetic nanomaterials have also been explored yet recollection is even more challenging sun et al conducted a study investigating the removal of carboxylated and aminated mps using chitin c8h13o5n n and graphene oxide go sponges 40 highly adsorptive sponges were used for up to 3 filtration cycles the adsorption kinetics showed that electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonds and π π interactions aided the high adsorption capacity therefore the high removal rate 40 regeneration of the go sponges was carried out by rinsing with ethanol and freeze drying the sponges were found to withstand significant stress and could also be biodegraded by microorganisms in the soil layered double hydroxides ldhs are another example of how nanostructures can enhance mp separation tiwari et al synthesized znal at a size 100 nm and a regular hexagonal structure with an average pore diameter of 1 6 nm 41 the znal zeta potential at ph 4 and 10 was 45 5 and 8 mv respectively while that of ps was 36 8 and 43 4 mv respectively since the removal dropped with increasing ph it was concluded that electrostatic attraction was the dominant mechanism the particles were then removed by sedimentation sem eds analysis showed high carbon content on the surface of the znal ldh because of the accumulation of plastic debris znal ldh became protonated as oh2 groups are on the surface and the negatively charged mps could then be easily adsorbed non magnetic adsorbents are less preferred for mp separtion due to difficulty in reuse which becomes even more difficult in the nano range hence 3d structures such as sponges rather then particles are suggested as a more facile route 3 1 3 nanoplastic remediation by adsorption processes while the utlization of magnetic and non magnetic nano adsorbents for mp separation is commonly studied a limited number of studies use adosrption for np separation a study on different np diameters utilizing iron modified biochar as adsorbent was reported by singh et al 2021 an adsorption capacity of up to 206 46 mg g was reported for carboxyl nps of 30 nm diameter 38 it was found that complexation between the nps and the composite in addition to electrostatic attraction was the reason behind the adsorption process as the diameter drops from 1000 nm to 30 nm it was reported that there is a higher impact on conditions such as ph temperature and competitive ions this could be a possible reason behind the limited number of studies on smaller plastics nps in the context of a circular economy another study utilized functional mesoporous biochar mbc produced from contaminated corncobs in a mining area was reported by zhu et al 2022 for 100 nm size np remediation mbc has properties such as high structural stability specific surface area and high mesoscale porosity the stated properties make mbc a potential adsorbent for polystyrene nps removal from water additionally the contaminated corncobs contain abundant metallic active sites and functional groups that could act as additional adsorption sites to target nps the mbc had a maximum adsorption capacity of 56 mg g and a degradation rate of 100 this is significantly higher than the degradation rate of biochar bc and commercial activated carbon which were found to be 34 5 and 6 9 respectively the mbc is hydrothermally degraded after np adsorption and the adsorbent could effectively be regenerated the metal rich mbc approach could not only effectively remove microplastics but eliminate the heavy metal hazard coming from biomass in a mining area 42 however environmental conditions were not assesed in detail in this study an interesting observation in a study on nps remediation was that the surface area after adsorption was increased as a result of the adsorbed nps on the nanoparticles 41 furthermore gibbs s free energy calculations showed that adsorption is favorable and spontaneous in nature while it was more likely physical which also confirms the theoretical recovery of almost 100 of the nanocomposite due to the absence of chemical bonds 41 it was also found that the rate of adsorption was faster in deionized water di and freshwater 0 9 10 3 m than hardwater 4 10 3 m due to the presence of different ionic species that may compete for the same active sites therefore this study was found to be more suitable for freshwater where other competing ionic species were present in lower concentrations 41 these are consistent with the observatios of singh et al 2021 which report strong dependance of nps adsorption on environmental conditions compared to mps molecular dynamics can be used as an efficient tool to study the interaction between nps and adsorbents in details dettmann et al introduced a fundamental study to investigate the interaction between cnts and nps using course grained molecular dynamics 43 nps were simulated using different hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers and the hydrophobicity of cnts was tuned using functional groups on the inner surface in this study it was shown that nps based on hydrophobic polymers have strong affinity to be captured on both the outer surface and within the cnt 43 the functionalization of cnts had no significant effect on the adsorption of hydrophilic microplastics such as peo however polymers such as pp pe and ps were repelled away from the cooh groups and rather accumulate within the cnt structure the results of the magnetic and non magnetic nano adsorbents used for both mps and nps removal are summarized in table 1 it can be concluded that magnetic nanomaterials constitute a more facile route for the mnp separation by adsorption iron and iron based compounds allow for the easy separation of nanomaterials from the matrices many of these nanomaterials were found to be environmentally friendly economic and efficient the selectivity of nanomaterials can be tuned to enhance the removal of mps mainly by surface treatment techniques e g by making them more hydrophobic and enhancing the surface positive charge it should be noted however that the majority of the reviewed studies are undertaken in the lab with very limited contaminants present wastewater though has a complex matrix with different contaminants such as organics other ions etc the adsorption process will inevitably be impacted by such contaminants and the removal efficiency can be significantly lower in the real situation looking at table 1 for example most studies used di water or synthetic solutions as matrices hence challenges to be further considered include the competition of other ions impurities that can also be adsorbed on the involved surfaces and the regeneration of the involved nanomaterials after the removal cycle 3 2 filtration 3 2 1 commercial nanoporous membranes for mp separation this section focuses on commercial nanoporous membranes and their effectivemess in mp removal industrially applied membrane based water treatment technologies can be classified into reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf mf membranes cannot reject nanoplastics because of their large pore size on the other hand mps can be rejected through ro membranes by size exclusion however ro is energy intensive because of the high pressure requirement furthermore the appearance of larger sized pores and other local membrane imperfections in the module and pipework could result in the loss of membrane integrity 46 uf and nf are the most promising options for mp separation both of these types of membranes have internal nanofeatures because of their pore merits which can range from hundreds of nanometers uf to a few nanometers nf however mps can be detrimental to uf and nf by stimulating microbial activity and particulate accumulation on the membrane surface thus inducing fouling the hydrophobicity of mps could result in increased microbial activity and increased production of extracellular polymeric substances epss in natural surface water 47 specifically trypotophone like soluble microbial byproducts were entrapped in the membrane pores causing severe fouling similar results have also been reported using commercial membranes 48 49 ma et al studied iron based coagulants prior to uf 27 50 in a commercial polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane a pore size of 30 nm was sufficient for mp removal however fouling is still a major obstacle when the mixture was fed with coagulants effective coagulation of mps and hence large floc formation occurred thus larger flocs of pe mps could be rejected at a maximum efficiency of 90 9 in addition to the enhanced removal efficiency membrane fouling was also reduced due to the heterogeneous structure of the cake layer formed by the larger flocs a heterogeneous cake layer can therefore 1 act as an additional sieve and 2 prevent small molecules from getting stuck inside the membrane or attaching to its surface the heterogeneous cake layer can then be effectively backwashed without permanent damage to the membrane hence fouling can be considerably reduced while maintaining a high mp removal efficiency due to iron coagulation 27 3 2 2 nanomaterials in filter media and membrane modification filtration of mps can be achieved using nanoporous membranes and or incorporating nanoparticles within or on the surface of membranes or other filtration systems metal organic frameworks mofs are porous materials consisting of metal centers linked by organic ligands these structures have several unique properties including extended and tunable porosity variable pore functionality and high surface area which make them highly promising for pollutant separation 51 52 chen et al 53 studied the effects of incorporating mofs into melamine foam filters for mp remediation melamine foam is a fluffy porous foam with flexibility robustness and stability making it a suitable substrate the synergetic effect of the two constituents resulted in an effective mp separation the mofs were initially found to have positive zeta potential and hence exhibited enhanced interactions with the mps second mofs were functionalized with various functional groups such as nh2 oh no2 and br a hydroxyl functionalized zirconium based mof zr mof named uio 66 oh resulted in highest removal which shows that hydrogen bonding plays a significant role in the mp separation third the highly porous interconnected mof structure provided a substantial surface area for contact between the mof and the mps finally the high water stability of the functionalized zr mofs combined with the high tensile stress made the removal substantially more efficient in this study the loading of mofs onto melamine was 25 scaling up high cost and agglomeration effects are challenges yet to be addressed for large scale usage of mofs another approach is to incorporate mofs into membranes which results in mixed matrix membranes mmms 52 membrane processes use semi permeable film to allow the separation of pollutants from water and have been studied and applied due to their high separation efficiency low energy consumption and compactness 54 in membrane separation permeability is a critical factor in determining energy consumption and the properties of the membrane surface often determine the separation efficiency 55 gnanasekran et al 56 made polysulfone based mmms by incorporating mil 100 fe by varying the mof concentration it was found that at 0 5 wt a permeability of 72 l m2 h bar was observed for the separation of mp which is 10 3 times higher than that of the pristine polysulfone membrane 56 this was attributed to the hydrophilicity of mil 100 which aided in the formation of a hydration layer on the membrane surface at a higher concentration of mil 100 the hydrophilicity increased but the pore blockage increased as well therefore a loading of 0 5 wt was found to be optimal for the mp separation using dye as a pollutant model using mmms only a small percentage of nanomaterial fillers could enhance the permeability and removal of pollutants such as mps from water the removal of mps using this class of membranes was also studied using reduced graphene oxide rgo 57 the nanoporous structure of rgo was used to fabricate nanocomposite membranes based on polyacrylonitrile pan a flux of up to 323 6 l m2 h was obtained coupled with a removal of 82 at an rgo concentration of 0 83 wt 57 electrospun nanofiber membranes are another possible approach for effective mp separation 58 this is due to their highly porous nature which significantly reduces the energy needed for filtration since they have been employed and found effective for particulate matter removal such as pm10 10 μm pm2 5 2 5 μm and pm1 0 1 μm they have a great potential for effective microplastic separation from water ligand engineering on the spinning solution can be utilized to tune the properties of the nanofiber membranes for enhanced removal 3 2 3 nanoplastic remediation by membrane processes similar to mp np can be rejected by uf and nf membranes however fouling is a larger obstacle in np this is because of entrapping of np inside the membrane pores in the uf interactions between the particles and the surface of the membrane aid in the rejection of mps 59 here the nanofeatures of the pores start to have significant effects for example when the particles and the membrane are both hydrophobic their interaction is expected to be high at the same time when both the membrane and the np particles are negatively charged the particles can be rejected away from the membrane surface 59 the two phenomena counterbalance each other and with time can result in a variation in the membrane performance furthermore fouling is a significant obstacle that hinders long term use especially in np remediation 6 the adsorption stacking and entrapping of nps in and on the membrane surface can result in a major decline in flux 59 so higher pressure is required to compensate for flux losses the need for frequent membrane replacement due to fouling adds cost and raises environmental concerns specifically in np remediation the mechanistic and kinetic aspects of fouling by nps were studied in detail using commercial polysulfone membranes for mps of a size ranging from 13 to 690 nm 59 the fouling by mps occurs in 3 phases fig 2 first intermediate blocking fastest followed by complete blocking and cake layer formation the first step has the highest rate due to the roughness and membrane hydrophobicity once a layer is formed by the interaction between the mps and polysulfone hydrophobic hydrophobic additional layers of mps can stack up immediately initial roughness also enhanced this interaction 59 efficient cleaning procedures novel membrane materials and improved analytical techniques for detecting quantifying and identifying fouling due to mps are critical in the context of novel membrane fabrication layer by layer lbl assembly is a surface modification technique that has been utilized to enhance the permeability of nanoporous membranes for np removal 60 by alternating the assembly of polyethyleneimine pei and poly acrylic acid paa on a hydrolyzed electrospun pan membrane the membrane charge could be tuned and simultaneously the mechanical strength and hydrophilicity of pan could be increased water flux of up to 861 l m2 h was achieved at a pressure of 1 bar an np removal of 89 9 was achieved by involving nano sized ps particles of 50 nm in size the removal was based on pore sieving and electrostatic interactions the positively charged membrane exhibited the highest reduction due to the high mp attraction to the negatively charged ps particles 60 challenges related to this technique include long term stability and the mp concentration threshold when the positive charges on the membrane are neutralized after an extended period or if the mp concentration is too high sieving may not be efficient and thus the removal may be reduced hence sieving still plays a significant role in the removal of mps from water via membrane technology typically the smaller the membrane pore size the higher the chances of mp retention hence enhancing the flux of nanoporous membranes without sacrificing porosity or inducing defects is crucial for the np separation althernatively novel membrane materials such as holey ti3c2tx mxene nanosheets developed by etching co3o4 nanoparticles from ti3c2tx nanosheets can be utilized for high np rejection and fouling mitigation 61 florescent particles of sizes ranging from 80 to 1000 were used as models for nps it was found that h ti3c2tx nanosheets exhibited a planar porous structure with nano holes of 25 nm average diameter the nanoholes provided additional water channels in the mxene based membranes which resulted in notably high fluxes 196 7 l m 2h 1kpa 1 with a simultaneous rejection of up to 99 3 in general size exclusion is dominant in large spherical mps however in nps and in mp fibers where the mnps have similar size to the membrane pores other mechanisms come into play as well these include hydrophobic hydrophilic interactions and electrostatic repulsion attraction table 2 summarizes studies related to the removal of mnps from aqueous environments using uf and nf membranes 4 degradation by advanced oxidation processes 4 1 titania tio2 based photocatalysts advanced oxidation processes aops are efficient for the degradation of organics such as dyes and pharmaceuticals hence can be a promising option for mp removal mps can degrade naturally however their degradation rate is prolonged photocatalysis was found to be the most common aop for mp removal from aqueous environments considering the nano range photocatalysis is based on semiconducting materials such as titania tio2 whose electrons can be excited from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb by exposure to a light source uv or visible light when electrons are excited they cause the generation of reactive oxygen species ros that induce the degradation of mps fig 3 shows the degradation mechanism using ps as a model mp the photocatalytic process is first initiated as shown in step 1 where the photocatalyst gains enough energy from incident light hv to cause electrons to jump from the valence band to the conduction hand hence a hole h is generated in the valence band 63 o2 and h2o are then adsorbed on the tio2 surface step 2 therefore h in the valence band and the e in the conduction band react with these species to form superoxide ion o 2 and hydroxyl oh radicals step 3 oh radicals then produce carbon centered radicals throughout the entire polymer matrix sep 4 63 64 carbon centered radicals then react with o2 to produce peroxide radicals which then react with water to produce alkoxy polymer radicals step 4 63 65 intermediate products such as carbonyl or ketone compounds form which finally complete the photocatalytic oxidation resulting in the formation of co2 and h2o 63 the efficacy of the removal mechanism can vary depending on the size shape and concentration of the mps engineering nanomaterials can enhance the process to increase light absorption expand the wavelength range or change the morphology of the semiconductor 66 nanosized tio2 gained particular interest due to the large surface area to volume ratio ariz tarazona et al 67 who used green synthesis derived from the extrapallial fluid of saltwater mussels conducted a study on high density polyethylene hdpe degradation using n tio2 and compared it to the conventional sol gel method the mussel derived nanostructures exhibited a smaller bandgap redshift and hence they could absorb photons under visible light the properties of the aqueous medium affect the efficiency of the mp degradation process fig 3 shows that the generation of oh is a key step in degradation therefore it is essential that 1 an oxidative medium is present and 2 the recombination of holes and electrons is avoided temperature ph and humidity in the surrounding medium are also factors that influence mp degradation lower temperatures typically increase the surface area of the mps due to fragmentation and lower ph favors the formation of hydroperoxide resulting in higher removal rates 67 humidity is also essential for the mp degradation using semiconductor nanomaterials 67 this is because more water is adsorbed on semiconductor surface fig 3 which means that there is a greater chance of ros oh formation therefore it is not only essential to have oxygenated medium but high adsorption of water on the tio2 as well by studying the effect of the degradation rate on mps using mesoporous tio2 coating it was found that smaller mps had faster degradation rate compared to larger ones due to the high surface area to volume ratio 66 furthermore spherical mps had a higher degradation rate compared to a film due to the increased interaction of bulk and surface bound oh by the diffusion of radicals film shaped mps also led to a poorly oxygenated reaction medium furthermore additional pores in mesoporous tio2 were found to enhance the photocatalytic activity by increasing the oh availability as a result of the increased surface area 66 it should be noted that tio2 nanopowder has high photocatalytic activity however its filtration from the aqueous solution increases the complexity and cost of the overall process on the industrial scale this motivates the use of support materials such as open cell β silicon carbide alveolar foams these materials not only favor light absorption into the material but are thermally and chemically stable 68 4 2 zinc oxide zno photocatalysts zinc oxide zno is another semiconductor of interest in mp removal by aops which has promising photocatalytic properties zno also exhibits high redox potential and electron mobility at room temperature in addition to its antibacterial activity 69 70 tofa et al studied the degradation of low density polyethylene ldpe film in water using zno nanorods 71 it was found that the degree of oxidation was directly related to the surface area of the catalyst this shows the importance of nanoscale materials in increasing the surface area and subsequently increasing the degradation of the mps defect engineering and nano features enhanced mp removal by zno for example the degradation of ldpe in water was investigated using platinum pt nanoparticles deposited on zno nanorods which formed a plasmonic photocatalyst 72 pt is a plasmonic metal which can reduce the recombination of electrons and holes hence increasing the radical formation fig 3 the resonance of interfacial conduction electrons also leads to enhanced light absorption as a result of this modification 73 fig 4 a shows that the addition of pt increased light absorption in the visible region at 385 nm by up to 78 72 a reduction in band to band excitation at 365 nm was also observed due to increased defect intensity in the zno nanorods resulting in enhanced optical adsorption fig 4 b shows a reduction in the radiative recombination of the photogenerated electrons in the pt coated nanorods which results in a higher degree of radical species formation and an increased degradation rate pt nanoparticles therefore act as electron sinks reducing the charge recombination figs 4 c d and e also depict the deeper cavities formed in the ldpe film as a result of the pt coating 72 challenges such as water contamination by nanoparticles and the need for additional filtration and high residence time as a result of the employed batch process need to be further studied novel reactor designs such as those using glass fiber support to allow continuous degradation in a flow through reactor would be needed 74 in such reactors polypropylene pp was degraded using zno nanorods and a continuous increase in the carbonyl index was observed this reactor design opens up new opportunities for scale ups furthermore the antibacterial properties of zno compared to those of other photocatalysts are expected to result in a dual effect of mp degradation and disinfection however mp degradation using zno in a natural wastewater environment has not yet been investigated 4 3 nanoplastic remediation by aops nps are more presistant to remove compared to mps hence additional features and defects may be needed to increase the rate of photocatalytic degradation the effect of the morphology of the photocatalyst on the degradation rate of primary nps has been investigated 63 barrier tubular and mixed tio2 tio2 b tio2 t and tio2 m prepared by anodization were compared fig 5 the formation of tubular and mixed structures shows a redshift hence a smaller bandgap these optical characteristics were resulted from surface defects which favored the separation of charges especially in the multilayer structure tio2 m that exhibited the highest transfer of photogenerated charge carriers thus increasing the rate of degradation of nps additionally other photocatalysts such as copper oxide cu2o cuo were considered for targetting nps 76 cu2o cuo have a bandgap of 2 ev 76 however the related degradation efficiencies vary from 18 to 23 76 despite the low removal rate the study by acuña bedoya et al 76 laid a foundation for the exploration of other photocatalysts these materials can be relatively non expensive non toxic and abundant hence viable in such applications it is concluded that two routes can be taken to achieve effective np separation both relating to reducing the band gap alternative nanomaterials to tio2 can be explored and additional nanofeatures and defects can be implemented it is crucial however to maintain charge separation despite the low bandgap 4 4 other photocatalysts and perspectives reducing the size of the photocatalysts increases the surface area thus increasing the photocatalytic activity 68 77 however reducing the size below the quantum confinement threshold can increase the bandgap of semiconductors blue shift which means their adsorption capability spectrum becomes limited therefore it is critical to fine tune the size and design of semiconductor nanomaterials that are also absorbed in visible light 66 as the surface area of nanoparticles can increase the exposed area to the ros but the blue shift is not desired catalytic oxidation can also be used for mp degradation using graphitic nanomaterials this example was demonstrated by kang et al using functionalized magnetic spring like carbon nanotubes nanosprings fig 4 f l 75 in addition to the robust helical structure the synergistic effect of nitrogen doping and metal encapsulation mn enhanced the catalytic activity and stability of cnts this synergistic effect resulted in a drop in the activation energy of cnts from 106 2 to 87 5 kj mol in mn enhanced carbon nanosprings hence amplifying the catalytic activity as part of this effort the toxicity of the resulting intermediates has also been studied and they have no significant environmental impact a 50 mass reduction was observed using a synthetic mp solution 75 table 3 summarizes studies on the photocatalytic degradation of nps and mps from water using nanomaterials 5 current limitations and future perspectives the removal of mps by the use of nanotechnology is highly gaining potential fig 6 reveals the percentage of studies on mp remediation approaches with respect to mp polymers and shapes it is evident that most of the works deal with ps beads however it is crucial to address fibrous and fragmented mps which are among the most prevalent in wwtps 14 several studies have reported that fibers are among the most difficult mps to remove 3 while they are also expected to have the highest toxicity 26 in membrane technology fibers were found to pass longitudinally through membrane pores thus limiting the removal efficiency 81 this is also a challenge faced in other high pressure processes including ro despite its small cutoff size 46 in particular ps and pe are the most abundant and complex species to remove from water bodies 14 however some mps are also present in wwtps such as polyurethane pur 18 that have not been systematically studied furthermore mps are rarely present in their pure form in wwtps because various additives such as plasticizers flame retardants and pigments are added to them during manufacture 18 they can also adsorb heavy metals pahs and other pharmaceuticals this factor is not considered in the removal studies finally the presence of salts and other species can disrupt mp removal 35 39 thus the matrix mp nature size and shape affect the molecular interactions at the nanoscale and hence sensitivity studies are crucial to assess the efficacy of the proposed method while a natural wastewater environment needs to be simulated as well the process specific benefits and limitations of various nanotechnology features to enhance photocatalytic degradation adsorption and membrane efficiency are summarized in table 4 for adsorption the principal advantage that nanomaterials can bring about is the improved surface area yet a challenging factor is regeneration the loss of mps adsorption capacity was common in many of the reported studies in this review this can be associated with the high hydrophobic interactions between the engineered adsorbent and mps making their dissociation challenging some active sites remain blocked even with high thermal treatment limiting the adsorbents regeneration capacity it is suggested that an ideal adsorption material would be stimuli responsive thus swinging from hydrophobic to hydrophilic by changing the environment condition the material should be superhydrophobic for mp capture and hydrophilic for release with minimal energy consumption this could possibly be achieved using smart thermo responsive materials nanomaterials tunability and functionalization capabilities at the molecular level can facilitate this goal additionally studies on mnps rarely include the effect of competing ions in the water matrix synthetic solutions rather than real water or wastewater are usually tested in this review it is shown that the adsorption matrix becomes highly crucial for nps compared to mps where factors such as ion concentration significantly reduce the adsorption capacity and selectivity for smaller plastic fragments hence for future studies on nps it is crucial to study different water matrices and compare the effect of different ions and ultimately test using real water and wastewater samples nanoporous membranes have resulted in effective mp separation mainly by size exclusion however due to the high hydrophobicity of mps severe fouling on the membrane surface can occur membrane modifications such as mmms have been employed involving various nanofillers and surface coatings utilizing various nanoparticles to tune the surface charge and hydrophilicity to mitigate fouling a small percentage of nanofillers in mmms can result in higher flux and mnp removal additionally nanofibrous membranes have been suggested as an effective route to enhanced mnps remediation in np separation for example size exclusion is not the only mechanism but the role of surface charge and hydrophilicity is critical as well advanced membranes based on 2 d materials such as rgo and mxenes have been found effective for np remediation with lower energy requirement positively charged membranes have resulted in high np separation yet they also attract other negatively charged species such as organics hence for np separation it is preferable to have negatively charged super hydrophilic membranes to repel nps and accelerate water transport across the membrane for photocatalytic degradation it is reported that the increase in the surface area enhances light absorption and surface reactions this can be achieved through the involvement of 1 nanoparticulate photocatalysts and or 2 the introduction of defects nanomaterials were also designed to limit the recombination of electrons and holes exciton thus increasing the exciton stability however a major limitation is the filtration of nanomaterials after usage foam supports were used as a solution to this another major limitation with nanomaterials is the increase in the bandgap size blue shift which limits the absorption wavelength range it is preferable to design nanomaterials to absorb in the visible region to avoid mp fragmentation it should also be noted that studies on mnps take place under different experimental conditions employing various means of quantitative analysis for example for photocatalytic degradation carbonyl index 71 79 turbidity 63 mass loss 77 or total organic carbon toc 68 have been used making a direct comparison of the removal efficiencies challenging therefore it is crucial to design a standard set of conditions and methods for mp quantification especially for photocatalytic degradation additionally a clear quantification method is needed to distinguish between degradation and complete mineralization photocatalysis can result in partial degradation of mnps which may raise concerns related to downstream composition thus ensuring complete mineralization is crucial also it is suggested that hybrid technologies combining photocatalysis and separation technologies need to be systematically explored to ensure complete removal if the latter is not achieved solely by the photocatalytic degradation stage one challenge of the engineered nanomaterials for water and wastewater treatment is their possible ecotoxicity several toxicological studies have shown that nanoparticles could have detrimental effects on most organisms especially at high concentrations 84 therefore additional leaching and toxicology studies need to be systematically performed when nanoparticles are used in any wastewater treatment process risk management studies have also become critical in addition cost analysis is also important with respect to both synthesis of the nanostructures as well as process economics and operation molecular dynamics can also play an important role in studying the mechanisms at the nanoscale for the processes under development and hence can aid in predicting optimal conditions another challenge in implementing nanotechnology for mnp remediation is large scale production studies to pave the way toward pilot and industrial scale implementation are therefore needed 6 conclusions mnps remediation using nanotechnology enhanced methods was reviewed the number of investigations is steadily increasing with reported studies focusing mainly on adsorption membrane technologies and photocatalysis the main outcomes are summarized below mnp adsorption using magnetic nanomaterials is highly promising and has been facilitated mainly by tuning the surface properties of iron and iron oxide based particles through functionalization to increase hydrophobicity regeneration which is hindered by the high hydrophobicity of the mnps is a challenging issue and needs further investigation when nps are considered the water matrix plays a larger role compared to that in mps hence optimization of the adsorbents in a real water or wastewater environment needs to be considered as a future direction photocatalytic degradation using nanocatalysts has been also well studied as it decomposes the mnps however the fate of byproducts of mnps is not thoroughly investigated nanocatalysts can be tuned to increase the surface area enhance light absorption improve electron hole separation and increase surface reactions yet fragmentation of mnps can occur when uv light is used as a light source so visible light is often preferred in addition the degradation rate needs to be further increased from the current maximum of up to 80 reported by most studies as to achieve a competitive advantage for large scale application hybrid degradation separation technologies need also to be sytematically explored as an alternative route to ensure removal when complete degradation is not achieved nanoporous membranes mmms with nanofillers dispersed in the membrane matrix and membranes coated with nanostructured films are also efficient strategies among other improvements in key performance indicators these modifications have been shown to reduce membrane fouling and increase mnp flux and separation fabrication methods to produce materials such as novel electrospun nanofibers and 2d structures such as mxenes are needed as these materials can be effective toward separation of even resellient nps finally standardization of quantitative techniques for the detection and treatment of mnps is required and studies under real wastewater conditions and solution compositions with different matrices shapes sizes and compositions of mnps need to be systematically investigated declaration of competing interest the

12574,nonpoint source contamination from early stormwater runoff in the urban area has been frequently reported and a comprehensive urban stormwater treatment system in high population density location is essential however there is an absence of a comprehensive discharge protocol for the settling tank that leads to inefficient treatment process with a non adaptive practice that fixing certain discharge period a case study in a large scale urban settling tank located at y city south korea is considered to validate the discharge protocol proposed the stormwater is first analyzed with its respective characteristics from various interception facilities which act as buffers before entering settling tank thereupon homogenous stormwater entered from multiple interception facilities is collected accordingly from the settling tank to assess the settling performance by measuring the suspended solid ss concentration in different timeframes a mathematical model targeting the settling tank is then developed and further calibrated at different settling tank layers across different settling periods with multi objective genetic algorithms based on the settling parameters considered an uncertainty analysis is then conducted due to the relatively small dataset collected by incorporating 10 000 attempts of monte carlo simulation varying the ss concentration at different layers in the settling tank as a result discharge time for the top and middle layer by obeying the discharge limit falls at the 18th and 58th hour from the initial stormwater entry to the settling tank this study successfully demonstrated the approach on identifying optimal discharge protocol for urban settling tank based on the initial ss concentration under limited data graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords urban stormwater treatment settling tank multi objective calibration monte carlo simulation optimal discharge time protocol data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction global urbanization at a swift pace owing to exponential population growth has led to a substantial increase in impervious areas a major consequence of the expansion of impervious regions is the unpredictable urban stormwater runoff that causes the impairment of nearby surface water bodies 1 marsalek and rochfort 2 reported substantial water impairment in the united states due to the massive amount of waste and pollutants flushed from urban stormwater such impairment from nonpoint source pollution due to the presence of high loading nutrients heavy metals bacteria and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in stormwater runoff has frequently been reported to be associated with the disruption of public health 3 8 therefore a comprehensive treatment strategy must be developed to suppress the adverse effects of stormwater runoff in urban areas sanitary sewer overflow sso and combined sewer overflow cso are commonly adopted to address such situations 9 a summary of the scholarly outcomes extracted from the scopus database from 2008 to 2022 of urban stormwater treatment with the relevant keywords cso and sso is shown in fig 1 which illustrates the research interest in this field at the global level sso during peak flow in a wastewater treatment system is mainly caused by infiltration or inflow of rainfall blockages and flow restrictions in the sewer system 10 in the event of heavy rain a mixture of domestic sewage and stormwater discharge classified as combined sewer overflow exceeds the loading capacity of the wastewater treatment system during such events an enormous amount of untreated wastewater may be discharged towards nearby surface water 11 13 however it is difficult to conduct detailed studies on cso owing to the considerable time required and expensive on site sampling 14 to control the hazards posed by cso to cities low impact development lid and best management practices bmps have been recommended in recent years to improve infiltration evaporation storage and retention of stormwater runoff in urban areas 15 lid practices increase the ability of a city to control stormwater runoff at the source via a decentralized design involving rainwater harvesting green roofs and porous pavements 16 17 in contrast bmps control flooding and runoff pollution with the aid of detention ponds 18 19 in addition south korea has introduced integrated watershed management to address the negative impact of cso in urban areas 20 various well established combinatorial sustainable stormwater runoff management methods can be incorporated including retention settling tanks artificial wetlands and biofiltration swales 21 among the available options retention settling tanks have proven to have remarkable capabilities in reducing the impact of stormwater runoff on receiving water bodies in many north american and european cities 22 in addition to strategizing the discharge management protocol computational aided methods can be applied to study the effects of the suggested urban stormwater treatment system for example aby jean et al 23 showed that combining a predictive model and a control system integrated with green structures can reduce the cso volume and frequency zhang et al 24 simulated a settling model for water sand separation considering the heterogeneous diameter distribution of fundamental particles and the variation of emulsion viscosity with water content and analyzed the effects of temperature and settling time on water sand separation moreover qasim et al 25 observed the settling velocity of ballasted flocs in settling tank water by combining stokes law with a modified tambo and watanabe model to accurately predict the settling velocity of ballasted flocs bürger et al 26 proposed a numerical method based on the established activated sludge model no 1 to simulate the settling of sequencing batch reactor reactions in wastewater treatment plants that accurately respond to the settling process of flocculated particles such as biomass and activated sludge as previously described the untreated overflow is discharged directly into the river if the sewage in the sedimentation tank is not discharged to the wastewater treatment plant on time and the combined flow exceeds the capacity of the interceptor therefore settling tanks play a vital role in the integrated management of stormwater runoff especially during heavy rainfall specifically the retention time of rainwater in the settling tank is crucial to prevent overloading in the subsequent wastewater treatment plant operation thus a settling model needs to be introduced to simulate the sedimentation process in sedimentation tanks and determine the optimal time to maximize the efficiency of sedimentation tank operation the objective of this study was to identify the most time effective and economical strategy for operating a settling tank and involved i identification of the water quality and inflow characteristics of nonpoint pollution sources caused by urban rainwater runoff ii development of a settling model representing a real case study iii proposal of an optimal discharge time from the settling tank and iv evaluation of the reliability of the proposed discharge protocol 2 problem statement retention type nonpoint source management facilities were installed around the drainage area to control pollution from nonpoint sources caused by stormwater runoff and to improve the quality of the surrounding water bodies in addition a case study lake g located in y city south korea was investigated in line with the study objectives as reported by local authorities the water quality in lake g has continued to deteriorate over time due to nonpoint pollutants in the upper watershed according to rainfall statistics from 2000 to 2020 rainfall was mainly concentrated between june and september in particular the total rainfall was the highest during the rainy season in july and august therefore river pollution from nonpoint sources also occurs most frequently in summer which is hot and humid owing to the maritime climate the rainwater collection facility consists of ten interception facilities and a settling tank in y city fig 2 when the rainfall exceeded 5 mm rainwater flowed into the interception facilities and the collected rainwater was transported to the settling tank with the installed transfer pump however no well established discharge protocol for settling tanks currently exists as they often overload the h wwtp by exceeding the maximum allowable treatment capacity this study simulated the rainwater settling process in a settling tank using the developed mathematical model to propose an optimal discharge protocol under various uncertainties to reduce the operational burden of h wwtps and maximize the efficiency of the wastewater treatment system 2 1 interception facilities and settling tank all ten interception facilities are split flow shaped with separate transport lines for stormwater and domestic wastewater as a primary collection facility for the initial rainfall the water quality of the collected rainwater directly affects the sedimentation process of the settling tank therefore an experimental analysis of the stormwater was performed before it flowed into the settling tank to understand the characteristics of the initial rainfall the settling tank design is presented in appendix a1 the total volume of the sedimentation tank is 11 500 m3 and the tank is constructed of reinforced concrete the bottom of the settling tank had a 3 sloping surface resulting in a volume that was not proportional to the sampling height in the middle of the settling tank with a water sampler fig 3 shows a complete urban drainage system replicating the case study a portion of the surface runoff first sinks into the city s rivers during rainfall and the remaining flows through designated pipelines into interception facilities the rainwater is then pressurized through pumps and conveyance pipes and sent to the settling tank in the settling tank suspended particles undergo a slow settling process eventually forming layers of sludge at the bottom of the tank the bottom layer of sludge is pumped and sent to the wastewater treatment plant for purification in contrast the upper layer of the supernatant is discharged into the lake or river upon meeting the discharge standard 3 methodology following the objectives stated earlier including on site stormwater characterization and optimal discharge time from the settling tank a comprehensive research framework is shown in fig 4 first the initial rainfall was collected by the different interception facilities mentioned in the previous section according to the sampling strategy proposed in section 3 1 the physicochemical characteristics of the collected water samples were assessed on different rainy days see section 3 2 the settling process was then examined by measuring the suspended solid ss concentration at three different levels top 0 m middle 2 5 m and bottom 5 m across different timeframes the settling performance varies across rain volume and the surrounding nonpoint pollutant sources considering several unforeseen circumstances while collecting the water sample from the settling tank during the rainy season a mathematical model was developed based on the takács model to assess the settling process 27 the model consisted of several settling parameters which has proven with the similarity of a success case study in the settling process which receiving stormwater as input several similar models have demonstrated similar applications for simulating the settling process of urban stormwater such as the west 28 winslamm 29 and qhm models 30 the settler model was further calibrated based on the data collected with a multi objective genetic algorithm to ensure that the model behaved like a real case scenario before proposing an optimal discharge time from the settling tank the system reliability was assessed using a monte carlo simulation to predict the effect of any possible scenarios based on the assumptions made mathematical modelling calibration and reliability assessment were performed using matlab software version 2021b in a computer with an intel i5 8500 cpu and 16 gb of ram 3 1 sampling strategy field sampling was conducted during the initial rainfall period from may to august 2021 for each of the ten interceptor facilities at the front end and the subsequent settling tank stormwater from ten interceptor facilities was sampled and analyzed four times under different rainfall conditions to understand the water quality characteristics of the initial rainfall and overflow water however sampling in the settling tank was conducted only three times because of infrequent and insufficient rainfall additionally various uncertainties such as the effect of temperature on the mixing pattern of pollutants 31 and different hydraulic regimes 32 were observed in the on site scene which led to considerable differences in the samples collected generally the transfer pump between the interceptor facilities and the settling tank operates by directing rainwater away from the interception facilities sampling was conducted at the center of the settling tank sampling port upon the complete transfer of rainwater the first sampling was initiated from the completion of rainwater conveyance followed by sample collection schedule of 0 5 1 3 24 and 72 h the repeated use of the water sampler disturbs the homogenization of the normal settling process in the settling tank and may lead to an inaccurate reflection of the water sample at different layers three different layers of water were collected at the top middle and bottom of the settling tank at 0 2 5 and 5 m respectively an alpha water sampler horizontal acrylic 1130 g42 3 2l was used for top or surface and middle layer sampling while the bottom layer was collected with a vertical sampler vertical sus304 1 5 l fig a4 to avoid strong interference in the settling tank during sampling both the water samplers were gently released into the sedimentation tank and retained for 5 min before collecting the sample similarly the sampler was gently pulled up to avoid interference at subsequent collection layer 3 2 physico chemical analyses when water samples were collected the temperature ph dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity ec were measured on site using an orion star a329 water quality meter samples were stored on ice immediately following collection and during transport to the laboratory and stored at 4 c in the laboratory for less than 48 h suspended solids ss total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and biological oxygen demand bod concentrations were measured in the laboratory using the korea water pollution process test standard es 04303 1b 33 tn was measured using uv absorption spectrophotometry 220 nm and tp was measured using ascorbic acid reduction 880 nm bod was measured using the uv winkler azide method total organic carbon toc was measured using a shimadzu toc vcsh total organic carbon analyzer 3 3 development of settling model the framework of the model has three main parts a mathematically developed settler model model calibration and uncertainty analysis with a monte carlo simulation mcs first a settler model was developed based on the double exponential settling velocity function v s x sc by takács et al 1991 to simulate the behavior in a settling tank eq 1 whereas x sc and x f are the total sludge and solid concentrations respectively subsequently the maximum settling velocity maximum vertical settling velocity hindered zone settling parameter flocculant zone settling parameter and nonsettleable fraction are abbreviated as v 0 v 0 r h r p f ns respectively a detailed explanation alongside the default parameter is shown in appendix b2 1 v s x sc max 0 min v 0 v 0 e r h x sc f ns x f e r p x sc f ns x f subsequently the model was calibrated with a multi objective genetic algorithm by comparing the experimental results with the model results until it was close to the realistic on field results the objective function for the calibration aimed to minimize the average of the mean absolute percentage errors mape across different retention times t in which t 0 5 1 3 24 and 72 h referred to the stormwater retained in the settling tank as per the sample collection strategy along three different layers top layer 1 middle layer 5 bottom layer 10 and n layer indicates the number of layers considered in the objective function which is three in this case the decision variable for such a calibration is based on previously mentioned parameters including v 0 v 0 r h r p and f ns 2 min f tss t lay e r t tss layer t tss layer t 100 n layer before proposing the optimal discharge protocol the model was constrained by the local discharge limit the discharge water quality standards of the settling tank refer to the lake water quality standards specified by the korean ministry of the environment 34 the standard concentration of ss was 15 mg l when the lake water was in an average condition the water quality condition of lake g over the last 5 years was investigated and the average concentration of ss was 7 4 mg l with the highest concentration reaching over 40 mg l therefore to ensure the water quality safety of the g lake water the discharge standard of the settling tank was set to 15 mg l finally an uncertainty analysis mcs was used to determine the optimal discharge time from the settling tank that has undergone the settling process for different rainwater ss concentrations refer to appendix b3 ten thousand attempts were performed and a uniform distribution among the ss concentrations was identified in the experimental attempt the overall system reliability was assessed for different discharge times such acts also prevent the overloading of nearby water bodies due to discharge an overview of this optimal discharge protocol is presented in appendix b1 4 results and discussion 4 1 physical chemical characteristics of water in interception facilities the results of the water quality analysis in the interception facilities showed significant differences in water quality depending on the amount of rainfall and rainfall characteristics of the four rainfall events see fig 5 the rainfall amounts for the four rainfall events were 46 7 mm case 1 14 3 mm case 2 13 2 mm case 3 and 8 9 mm case 4 respectively the ph range of the water quality was 7 8 to 8 2 showing weak alkalinity that was not significantly affected by changes in rainfall conditions the average concentration of ec was 676 0 μs cm 473 2 mg tds l and ec showed a significant difference with rainfall with a maximum value of 905 3 μs cm 633 7 mg tds l at a rainfall of 46 7 mm the average do concentration was 7 4 mg l and the do concentration decreased with increasing rainfall bod concentrations of the four rainwater samples showed substantial variability with concentrations ranging from 8 5 mg l to 2 7 mg l toc concentrations ranged from 4 0 mg l to 5 1 mg l and showed no significant changes at the time of maximum rainfall the maximum concentrations of both tn and tp were 18 6 mg l and 1 0 mg l respectively tn concentrations under the other three rainfall conditions were 3 5 mg l 4 8 mg l and 5 4 mg l the deviation in the tn concentration of the four samples was rather large which may have been caused by the large inflow of pollutants from the surrounding area under the scouring effect of heavy rainfall the average concentration of tp was 0 7 mg l which also showed a strong correlation with rainfall the concentration of ss decreased with rainfall and was positively correlated with rainfall with concentrations ranging from 248 2 mg l to 126 3 mg l the weight of organic materials was assessed based on ash free dry weight which ranged from 73 0 mg l to 100 mg l in which the proportion of organic matter in tss was found to be 44 1 on average from the results of the four sampling analyses it can be concluded that the scouring effect of the initial rainfall on the surrounding environment substantially affects the water quality of the rainwater notably the high ss concentration identified during the rainy season highlights the necessity of a subsequent treatment system settling tank a comprehensive discharge protocol is required to ensure discharge efficiency while abiding by the local discharge limit 4 2 settling performance overview three sampling events were conducted in the settling tank and the water samples were analyzed for changes in the ss concentration in the first sampling the water depth in the settling tank was 2 m due to the low rainfall therefore the water sample was taken at 2 m surface 1 m middle and 0 m bottom after the csos were conveyed the initial 0 h ss concentration was 236 5 mg l and immediately after the cessation of transport the surface ss showed a significant downward trend after 0 5 h a change in ss concentration was observed in the middle and bottom layers the ss concentrations in the surface and middle layers continued to decrease until after 24 h when the rate of decrease slowed subsequently the ss concentration in the bottom layer continued to increase owing to sedimentation fig 6a the second sample was collected at 18 mm of rainfall and a water depth of 5 m in the settling tank the initial concentration was 96 1 mg l when braking stopped the ss concentration slowly decreased in both the surface and middle layers and slowly increased in the bottom layer ss from 1 h onwards significant changes in ss concentrations were observed in all layers and a continuous and stable trend was maintained as shown in fig 6b the third sample was collected at 15 mm of rainfall and a water depth of 5 m in the settling tank the ss concentration in each layer maintained a stable trend from the initial 80 4 mg l the change tendency was the same in the surface and middle layers and the ss concentration in the bottom layer gradually increased fig 6c three different sampling dates were found to have a similar trend in which the bottom ss concentration increased over time with a successful settling process that received suspended solids from the upper layer in the settling tank 4 2 1 calibration of the settling model a mathematical model was developed based on the takacs model for the settling tank previously mentioned in the case study this model was then calibrated with a multi objective genetic algorithm according to the measured ss at a different layer in the settling tank across different sampling periods the objective of the calibration

12574,nonpoint source contamination from early stormwater runoff in the urban area has been frequently reported and a comprehensive urban stormwater treatment system in high population density location is essential however there is an absence of a comprehensive discharge protocol for the settling tank that leads to inefficient treatment process with a non adaptive practice that fixing certain discharge period a case study in a large scale urban settling tank located at y city south korea is considered to validate the discharge protocol proposed the stormwater is first analyzed with its respective characteristics from various interception facilities which act as buffers before entering settling tank thereupon homogenous stormwater entered from multiple interception facilities is collected accordingly from the settling tank to assess the settling performance by measuring the suspended solid ss concentration in different timeframes a mathematical model targeting the settling tank is then developed and further calibrated at different settling tank layers across different settling periods with multi objective genetic algorithms based on the settling parameters considered an uncertainty analysis is then conducted due to the relatively small dataset collected by incorporating 10 000 attempts of monte carlo simulation varying the ss concentration at different layers in the settling tank as a result discharge time for the top and middle layer by obeying the discharge limit falls at the 18th and 58th hour from the initial stormwater entry to the settling tank this study successfully demonstrated the approach on identifying optimal discharge protocol for urban settling tank based on the initial ss concentration under limited data graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords urban stormwater treatment settling tank multi objective calibration monte carlo simulation optimal discharge time protocol data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction global urbanization at a swift pace owing to exponential population growth has led to a substantial increase in impervious areas a major consequence of the expansion of impervious regions is the unpredictable urban stormwater runoff that causes the impairment of nearby surface water bodies 1 marsalek and rochfort 2 reported substantial water impairment in the united states due to the massive amount of waste and pollutants flushed from urban stormwater such impairment from nonpoint source pollution due to the presence of high loading nutrients heavy metals bacteria and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in stormwater runoff has frequently been reported to be associated with the disruption of public health 3 8 therefore a comprehensive treatment strategy must be developed to suppress the adverse effects of stormwater runoff in urban areas sanitary sewer overflow sso and combined sewer overflow cso are commonly adopted to address such situations 9 a summary of the scholarly outcomes extracted from the scopus database from 2008 to 2022 of urban stormwater treatment with the relevant keywords cso and sso is shown in fig 1 which illustrates the research interest in this field at the global level sso during peak flow in a wastewater treatment system is mainly caused by infiltration or inflow of rainfall blockages and flow restrictions in the sewer system 10 in the event of heavy rain a mixture of domestic sewage and stormwater discharge classified as combined sewer overflow exceeds the loading capacity of the wastewater treatment system during such events an enormous amount of untreated wastewater may be discharged towards nearby surface water 11 13 however it is difficult to conduct detailed studies on cso owing to the considerable time required and expensive on site sampling 14 to control the hazards posed by cso to cities low impact development lid and best management practices bmps have been recommended in recent years to improve infiltration evaporation storage and retention of stormwater runoff in urban areas 15 lid practices increase the ability of a city to control stormwater runoff at the source via a decentralized design involving rainwater harvesting green roofs and porous pavements 16 17 in contrast bmps control flooding and runoff pollution with the aid of detention ponds 18 19 in addition south korea has introduced integrated watershed management to address the negative impact of cso in urban areas 20 various well established combinatorial sustainable stormwater runoff management methods can be incorporated including retention settling tanks artificial wetlands and biofiltration swales 21 among the available options retention settling tanks have proven to have remarkable capabilities in reducing the impact of stormwater runoff on receiving water bodies in many north american and european cities 22 in addition to strategizing the discharge management protocol computational aided methods can be applied to study the effects of the suggested urban stormwater treatment system for example aby jean et al 23 showed that combining a predictive model and a control system integrated with green structures can reduce the cso volume and frequency zhang et al 24 simulated a settling model for water sand separation considering the heterogeneous diameter distribution of fundamental particles and the variation of emulsion viscosity with water content and analyzed the effects of temperature and settling time on water sand separation moreover qasim et al 25 observed the settling velocity of ballasted flocs in settling tank water by combining stokes law with a modified tambo and watanabe model to accurately predict the settling velocity of ballasted flocs bürger et al 26 proposed a numerical method based on the established activated sludge model no 1 to simulate the settling of sequencing batch reactor reactions in wastewater treatment plants that accurately respond to the settling process of flocculated particles such as biomass and activated sludge as previously described the untreated overflow is discharged directly into the river if the sewage in the sedimentation tank is not discharged to the wastewater treatment plant on time and the combined flow exceeds the capacity of the interceptor therefore settling tanks play a vital role in the integrated management of stormwater runoff especially during heavy rainfall specifically the retention time of rainwater in the settling tank is crucial to prevent overloading in the subsequent wastewater treatment plant operation thus a settling model needs to be introduced to simulate the sedimentation process in sedimentation tanks and determine the optimal time to maximize the efficiency of sedimentation tank operation the objective of this study was to identify the most time effective and economical strategy for operating a settling tank and involved i identification of the water quality and inflow characteristics of nonpoint pollution sources caused by urban rainwater runoff ii development of a settling model representing a real case study iii proposal of an optimal discharge time from the settling tank and iv evaluation of the reliability of the proposed discharge protocol 2 problem statement retention type nonpoint source management facilities were installed around the drainage area to control pollution from nonpoint sources caused by stormwater runoff and to improve the quality of the surrounding water bodies in addition a case study lake g located in y city south korea was investigated in line with the study objectives as reported by local authorities the water quality in lake g has continued to deteriorate over time due to nonpoint pollutants in the upper watershed according to rainfall statistics from 2000 to 2020 rainfall was mainly concentrated between june and september in particular the total rainfall was the highest during the rainy season in july and august therefore river pollution from nonpoint sources also occurs most frequently in summer which is hot and humid owing to the maritime climate the rainwater collection facility consists of ten interception facilities and a settling tank in y city fig 2 when the rainfall exceeded 5 mm rainwater flowed into the interception facilities and the collected rainwater was transported to the settling tank with the installed transfer pump however no well established discharge protocol for settling tanks currently exists as they often overload the h wwtp by exceeding the maximum allowable treatment capacity this study simulated the rainwater settling process in a settling tank using the developed mathematical model to propose an optimal discharge protocol under various uncertainties to reduce the operational burden of h wwtps and maximize the efficiency of the wastewater treatment system 2 1 interception facilities and settling tank all ten interception facilities are split flow shaped with separate transport lines for stormwater and domestic wastewater as a primary collection facility for the initial rainfall the water quality of the collected rainwater directly affects the sedimentation process of the settling tank therefore an experimental analysis of the stormwater was performed before it flowed into the settling tank to understand the characteristics of the initial rainfall the settling tank design is presented in appendix a1 the total volume of the sedimentation tank is 11 500 m3 and the tank is constructed of reinforced concrete the bottom of the settling tank had a 3 sloping surface resulting in a volume that was not proportional to the sampling height in the middle of the settling tank with a water sampler fig 3 shows a complete urban drainage system replicating the case study a portion of the surface runoff first sinks into the city s rivers during rainfall and the remaining flows through designated pipelines into interception facilities the rainwater is then pressurized through pumps and conveyance pipes and sent to the settling tank in the settling tank suspended particles undergo a slow settling process eventually forming layers of sludge at the bottom of the tank the bottom layer of sludge is pumped and sent to the wastewater treatment plant for purification in contrast the upper layer of the supernatant is discharged into the lake or river upon meeting the discharge standard 3 methodology following the objectives stated earlier including on site stormwater characterization and optimal discharge time from the settling tank a comprehensive research framework is shown in fig 4 first the initial rainfall was collected by the different interception facilities mentioned in the previous section according to the sampling strategy proposed in section 3 1 the physicochemical characteristics of the collected water samples were assessed on different rainy days see section 3 2 the settling process was then examined by measuring the suspended solid ss concentration at three different levels top 0 m middle 2 5 m and bottom 5 m across different timeframes the settling performance varies across rain volume and the surrounding nonpoint pollutant sources considering several unforeseen circumstances while collecting the water sample from the settling tank during the rainy season a mathematical model was developed based on the takács model to assess the settling process 27 the model consisted of several settling parameters which has proven with the similarity of a success case study in the settling process which receiving stormwater as input several similar models have demonstrated similar applications for simulating the settling process of urban stormwater such as the west 28 winslamm 29 and qhm models 30 the settler model was further calibrated based on the data collected with a multi objective genetic algorithm to ensure that the model behaved like a real case scenario before proposing an optimal discharge time from the settling tank the system reliability was assessed using a monte carlo simulation to predict the effect of any possible scenarios based on the assumptions made mathematical modelling calibration and reliability assessment were performed using matlab software version 2021b in a computer with an intel i5 8500 cpu and 16 gb of ram 3 1 sampling strategy field sampling was conducted during the initial rainfall period from may to august 2021 for each of the ten interceptor facilities at the front end and the subsequent settling tank stormwater from ten interceptor facilities was sampled and analyzed four times under different rainfall conditions to understand the water quality characteristics of the initial rainfall and overflow water however sampling in the settling tank was conducted only three times because of infrequent and insufficient rainfall additionally various uncertainties such as the effect of temperature on the mixing pattern of pollutants 31 and different hydraulic regimes 32 were observed in the on site scene which led to considerable differences in the samples collected generally the transfer pump between the interceptor facilities and the settling tank operates by directing rainwater away from the interception facilities sampling was conducted at the center of the settling tank sampling port upon the complete transfer of rainwater the first sampling was initiated from the completion of rainwater conveyance followed by sample collection schedule of 0 5 1 3 24 and 72 h the repeated use of the water sampler disturbs the homogenization of the normal settling process in the settling tank and may lead to an inaccurate reflection of the water sample at different layers three different layers of water were collected at the top middle and bottom of the settling tank at 0 2 5 and 5 m respectively an alpha water sampler horizontal acrylic 1130 g42 3 2l was used for top or surface and middle layer sampling while the bottom layer was collected with a vertical sampler vertical sus304 1 5 l fig a4 to avoid strong interference in the settling tank during sampling both the water samplers were gently released into the sedimentation tank and retained for 5 min before collecting the sample similarly the sampler was gently pulled up to avoid interference at subsequent collection layer 3 2 physico chemical analyses when water samples were collected the temperature ph dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity ec were measured on site using an orion star a329 water quality meter samples were stored on ice immediately following collection and during transport to the laboratory and stored at 4 c in the laboratory for less than 48 h suspended solids ss total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and biological oxygen demand bod concentrations were measured in the laboratory using the korea water pollution process test standard es 04303 1b 33 tn was measured using uv absorption spectrophotometry 220 nm and tp was measured using ascorbic acid reduction 880 nm bod was measured using the uv winkler azide method total organic carbon toc was measured using a shimadzu toc vcsh total organic carbon analyzer 3 3 development of settling model the framework of the model has three main parts a mathematically developed settler model model calibration and uncertainty analysis with a monte carlo simulation mcs first a settler model was developed based on the double exponential settling velocity function v s x sc by takács et al 1991 to simulate the behavior in a settling tank eq 1 whereas x sc and x f are the total sludge and solid concentrations respectively subsequently the maximum settling velocity maximum vertical settling velocity hindered zone settling parameter flocculant zone settling parameter and nonsettleable fraction are abbreviated as v 0 v 0 r h r p f ns respectively a detailed explanation alongside the default parameter is shown in appendix b2 1 v s x sc max 0 min v 0 v 0 e r h x sc f ns x f e r p x sc f ns x f subsequently the model was calibrated with a multi objective genetic algorithm by comparing the experimental results with the model results until it was close to the realistic on field results the objective function for the calibration aimed to minimize the average of the mean absolute percentage errors mape across different retention times t in which t 0 5 1 3 24 and 72 h referred to the stormwater retained in the settling tank as per the sample collection strategy along three different layers top layer 1 middle layer 5 bottom layer 10 and n layer indicates the number of layers considered in the objective function which is three in this case the decision variable for such a calibration is based on previously mentioned parameters including v 0 v 0 r h r p and f ns 2 min f tss t lay e r t tss layer t tss layer t 100 n layer before proposing the optimal discharge protocol the model was constrained by the local discharge limit the discharge water quality standards of the settling tank refer to the lake water quality standards specified by the korean ministry of the environment 34 the standard concentration of ss was 15 mg l when the lake water was in an average condition the water quality condition of lake g over the last 5 years was investigated and the average concentration of ss was 7 4 mg l with the highest concentration reaching over 40 mg l therefore to ensure the water quality safety of the g lake water the discharge standard of the settling tank was set to 15 mg l finally an uncertainty analysis mcs was used to determine the optimal discharge time from the settling tank that has undergone the settling process for different rainwater ss concentrations refer to appendix b3 ten thousand attempts were performed and a uniform distribution among the ss concentrations was identified in the experimental attempt the overall system reliability was assessed for different discharge times such acts also prevent the overloading of nearby water bodies due to discharge an overview of this optimal discharge protocol is presented in appendix b1 4 results and discussion 4 1 physical chemical characteristics of water in interception facilities the results of the water quality analysis in the interception facilities showed significant differences in water quality depending on the amount of rainfall and rainfall characteristics of the four rainfall events see fig 5 the rainfall amounts for the four rainfall events were 46 7 mm case 1 14 3 mm case 2 13 2 mm case 3 and 8 9 mm case 4 respectively the ph range of the water quality was 7 8 to 8 2 showing weak alkalinity that was not significantly affected by changes in rainfall conditions the average concentration of ec was 676 0 μs cm 473 2 mg tds l and ec showed a significant difference with rainfall with a maximum value of 905 3 μs cm 633 7 mg tds l at a rainfall of 46 7 mm the average do concentration was 7 4 mg l and the do concentration decreased with increasing rainfall bod concentrations of the four rainwater samples showed substantial variability with concentrations ranging from 8 5 mg l to 2 7 mg l toc concentrations ranged from 4 0 mg l to 5 1 mg l and showed no significant changes at the time of maximum rainfall the maximum concentrations of both tn and tp were 18 6 mg l and 1 0 mg l respectively tn concentrations under the other three rainfall conditions were 3 5 mg l 4 8 mg l and 5 4 mg l the deviation in the tn concentration of the four samples was rather large which may have been caused by the large inflow of pollutants from the surrounding area under the scouring effect of heavy rainfall the average concentration of tp was 0 7 mg l which also showed a strong correlation with rainfall the concentration of ss decreased with rainfall and was positively correlated with rainfall with concentrations ranging from 248 2 mg l to 126 3 mg l the weight of organic materials was assessed based on ash free dry weight which ranged from 73 0 mg l to 100 mg l in which the proportion of organic matter in tss was found to be 44 1 on average from the results of the four sampling analyses it can be concluded that the scouring effect of the initial rainfall on the surrounding environment substantially affects the water quality of the rainwater notably the high ss concentration identified during the rainy season highlights the necessity of a subsequent treatment system settling tank a comprehensive discharge protocol is required to ensure discharge efficiency while abiding by the local discharge limit 4 2 settling performance overview three sampling events were conducted in the settling tank and the water samples were analyzed for changes in the ss concentration in the first sampling the water depth in the settling tank was 2 m due to the low rainfall therefore the water sample was taken at 2 m surface 1 m middle and 0 m bottom after the csos were conveyed the initial 0 h ss concentration was 236 5 mg l and immediately after the cessation of transport the surface ss showed a significant downward trend after 0 5 h a change in ss concentration was observed in the middle and bottom layers the ss concentrations in the surface and middle layers continued to decrease until after 24 h when the rate of decrease slowed subsequently the ss concentration in the bottom layer continued to increase owing to sedimentation fig 6a the second sample was collected at 18 mm of rainfall and a water depth of 5 m in the settling tank the initial concentration was 96 1 mg l when braking stopped the ss concentration slowly decreased in both the surface and middle layers and slowly increased in the bottom layer ss from 1 h onwards significant changes in ss concentrations were observed in all layers and a continuous and stable trend was maintained as shown in fig 6b the third sample was collected at 15 mm of rainfall and a water depth of 5 m in the settling tank the ss concentration in each layer maintained a stable trend from the initial 80 4 mg l the change tendency was the same in the surface and middle layers and the ss concentration in the bottom layer gradually increased fig 6c three different sampling dates were found to have a similar trend in which the bottom ss concentration increased over time with a successful settling process that received suspended solids from the upper layer in the settling tank 4 2 1 calibration of the settling model a mathematical model was developed based on the takacs model for the settling tank previously mentioned in the case study this model was then calibrated with a multi objective genetic algorithm according to the measured ss at a different layer in the settling tank across different sampling periods the objective of the calibration approach was to minimize the absolute percentage error while comparing the modeled and measured ss concentrations by searching for feasible values representing the settling tank across five main parameters v 0 v 0 r h r p f ns the parametric values with the smallest error for v 0 v 0 r h r p and f ns were 79 m d 1 40 m d 1 9 04 10 4 m3 g ss 1 9 04 10 3 m3 g ss 1 and 5 32 10 3 respectively a comparison between the simulated and measured ss in the settling tank on 20th may is shown in fig 7 a and those for the remaining two sampling dates are shown in fig c1 as shown in fig 7 b the mape among the three sampling dates was 14 65 the highest mape was reported on 2nd july 19 77 the detailed absolute errors for each layer at different times are listed in table c1 4 3 optimal discharge
