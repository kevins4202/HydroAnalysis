6645,the rate of adoption of efficient irrigation practices influences the return on investment from those practices and affects how much and even whether aquifer conservation occurs a spatial dynamic programming model for an agricultural landscape indicates that as the rate of adoption increases the return on investment gradually decreases as groundwater levels rise in eastern arkansas usa the model results also show that slow adoption can increase aquifer depletion because there is a switch to irrigation intensive crops but fast adoption can conserve the aquifer because a larger proportion of the crops use less irrigation water even the fastest adoption rate should not dissuade future adoption because the return on investment in the efficient irrigation practices remains high at low adoption rates a subsidy of efficient irrigation practices for the least irrigation intensive crop is almost as cost effective for groundwater conservation as a tax on well pumping at high adoption rates only a tax on well pumping is very cost effective keywords irrigation return on investment rate of adoption 1 introduction concerns about groundwater availability and irrigation costs motivate the development of more efficient irrigation practices pfeiffer and lin 2014 such practices may conserve groundwater but also must increase economic returns since producers make changes on the expectation of higher economic returns the cumulative proportion of alternative irrigation practices on the landscape over time often follows an s shaped logistic function anderson et al 1999 griliches 1957 the s shaped function for the adoption rate means that adoption grows slowly initially then exponentially for a short period and then grows slowly again for the remainder of the time horizon to a ceiling adoption value conceptually the explanation for the s shaped function of diffusion was initially described as a process of imitation rogers 1962 but later as a more complex result of the economic choices among heterogeneous agents sunding and zilberman 2001 while the economics literature of irrigation practices is significant schaible and aillery 2012 there are few studies about how the rate of adoption affects aquifer depletion regional economics returns and the return on investment in irrigation practices griliches 1957 examines the adoption of hybrid corn across the united states introducing the idea of the s shaped function of adoption that includes an origin rate of acceptance and ceiling for adoption of new technology or practices anderson et al 1999 examines the adoption of precision leveling for cotton production over a twenty year period in arizona the adoption of the precision leveling follows an s shaped pattern with an adoption ceiling of 70 in the current application faster adoption may conserve the aquifer since the application of water to crops is less than before but the associated switch to more irrigation intensive crops and loss of return flows may diminish the aquifer the economic returns to the producers should rise due to the use of more efficient practices but the pace of the rise depends on what happens to groundwater levels the change in the return on investment in irrigation practices determines whether the adoption of these efficient irrigation practices will persist the return on investment may slow if faster adoption raises groundwater levels thereby lowering well pumping costs while the capital costs remain high studies of efficient irrigation practices generally indicate that adoption increases operating profits measured as revenue less variable inputs but raises the capital costs caswell and zilberman 1986 suggest that efficient practices are more likely where water holding capacity is low and there are higher crop or water prices further if adoption increases yield enough then efficient irrigation practices can actually raise the water demand of a crop with new land in production or a switch to more irrigation intensive crops the adoption of efficient practices is also able to increase water demand pfeiffer and lin 2014 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 in addition efficient irrigation practices can lower return flows and may limit aquifer recharge johnson et al 1999 the influence of the efficient irrigation practices on groundwater use is therefore not straightforward because of changes in the crop mix and return flows an analysis of the rate of adoption of irrigation practices on an agricultural landscape can provide insight into when efficient irrigation is good for groundwater conservation a spatial dynamic model of the agricultural landscape in eastern arkansas compares the rate of adoption of efficient irrigation practices with conventional irrigation practices to understand water conservation and the return on investment in those irrigation practices each efficient irrigation practice differs from the conventional irrigation practice in terms of the water consumption of the crops and the irrigation capital costs the water consumption of crops with efficient irrigation are lower but the capital costs are higher the return on investment in efficient irrigation practices change in response to the rate of adoption scenarios the aggregation to the landscape of the site level choices allow for an examination of aggregate aquifer depletion and economic returns for producers on the landscape arkansas has 9 of all irrigated acres and more than 7 of irrigated water applied in the united states usda 2013 reliance on the irrigation water from the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer prompted the 2014 arkansas water plan to recommend more efficient irrigation practices anrc 2014 such practices include the mississippi state university s row crop irrigation science and extension research riser program for soybean and corn production and zero grade leveling for rice production in 2013 roughly 36 of farms and 45 of irrigated acres in arkansas use at least one efficient irrigation practice usda 2013 the most common practice is precision leveling or zero grade leveling with 22 of all irrigated acres followed by tailwater pits diking time limits or alternative row irrigation with 18 of all irrigated acres producers face multiple barriers in adopting efficient irrigation practices but the main reason from the u s agricultural census is that investigating improvements is not a priority and 34 of farms cite this reason more than half of producers indicate they rely on extension agents or university specialists for reducing irrigation costs or conserving water usda 2013 the methods for modeling the land use irrigation and rate of efficient irrigation practice adoption are in the next section the methods section also describes the sensitivity analyses and the policy scenarios the following section provides detail on the data to parameterize the model components the results and discussion sections explains the findings of the models and the concluding remarks summarize the findings and relates them to the literature 2 methods the model we develop examines how the rate of adoption of efficient irrigation practices influences groundwater conservation economic returns and the return on investment in efficient irrigation the objective agricultural producers follow is to maximize economic returns initially we describe the constraints producers face in pursuit of this objective because the choice variables producers use to maximize economic returns have useful context in constraints on land crop types irrigation practices and water resources the model makes choices over land use and irrigation practices for each site i of the m available sites the land constraint eq 1 only allows for

practices called riser for soybean and corn the crop type and irrigation practice at a given period t for each site i is lijk t the allowable amount of land in each crop type at a site is proportional to the original amount land in each crop at the site the proportion depends on the average historical amount of land in each crop type within the study area these constraints reflect unobservable agronomic features on the landscape that make the likelihood very low that only one crop is on a site since these crops typically rotate with soybeans 2 1 irrigation choices the amount of water

choices as a social planner rather than as a myopic competitive producer an extensive literature compares the differences between socially optimal and competitive models of groundwater use koundouri 2004 and these generally indicate a difference in net returns between 4 and 5 provencher and burt 1994 2 4 return on investment and sensitivity analyses the return on investment of the irrigation technology adoption for each crop is the difference in economic profit at each site with and without adoption and then dividing this by the aggregate costs of adopting the alternative irrigation practice at each site the use of the median value of all the sites for each model run reduces the influence of outlier return on investment values sensitivity analysis of key parameters help in the study of the model results first halving and doubling the time horizon allows us to observe how the length of the time horizon influences outcomes the length of the time horizon influences how valuable the adoption of the practices will be which affects the economic returns and aquifer depletion second there is the halving and doubling of the initial depth to groundwater because the cost of groundwater pumping is a key factor in the use of alternative irrigation practices finally the halving and doubling of the margins for each crop allow us to see how the boom and bust cycles of crop or input prices could influence the use of alternative irrigation practices at different adoption rates the crop margin is the revenue less the production cost excluding irrigation cost per acre each sensitivity analysis compares outcomes for the baseline results to the outcomes for the slowest and fastest rate of adoption scenarios 2 5 policies the policy options for groundwater conservation include a cap on groundwater use a tax groundwater pumping and a cost share on an alternative package of irrigation practices for corn and soybean known as the riser system the limit on groundwater use at each site i is for pumping to be 60 less than the current groundwater use at each site i for each period a tax on groundwater pumping of 2 achieves groundwater conservation similar to the cap on groundwater use the cost share for the riser system irrigation scheduling tool soil moisture sensors surge valves and poly pipe planner is set at 60 based on the rates from the natural resource conservation service s nrcs agricultural water enhancement program nrcs 2014 3 data the study area has 2724 sites across 11 counties in arkansas kovacs and durand morat 2017 these sites are within three eight digit hydrological unit code huc watersheds fig 1 where unsustainable groundwater pumping has been occurring the initial crop acreage for each cell comes from the crop land data layer from 2017 johnson and mueller 2010 the land in irrigated versus non irrigated soybean acreage comes from the national agricultural statistic service nass data on harvested acreage for 2010 2011 usda 2018 additional details on crop acreage is in the supporting information table s1 average maximum acreages for each crop by county for the years 2001 2015 constrain the acreage of crops usda 2018 the average maximum percentage of land for each crop and each site is as follows rice 27 irrigated soybean 60 irrigated corn 20 and non irrigated soybean 20 the crop yield at the county level comes from nass usda 2018 a real discount rate of 2 comes from a 30 year treasury bond yield over the last decade of 5 minus an expected inflation rate of 3 u s department of the treasury 2018 3 1 groundwater use recharge and return flows the depth to the water table and the initial saturated volume of the aquifer come from the arkansas natural resources commission anrc 2010 and summary statistics for these data are in table s1 of the supporting information the well pumping of the aquifer causes the saturated volume to decline the initial size of the aquifer is the product of the saturated thickness of the aquifer multiplied by land area a calibrated model of recharge from 1994 to 1998 from natural precipitation and surface streams determines the natural recharge nri of the alluvial aquifer reed 2003 the hydraulic diffusivity divided by the square of the shortest distance between the pumped well and the nearby aquifer defines how much pumping from a nearby well depletes the aquifer hydraulic diffusivity is the ratio of the transmissivity and the specific yield of the unconfined alluvial aquifer barlow and leake 2012 transmissivity is the product of hydraulic conductivity and saturated volume and the hydraulic conductivity is the rate of groundwater flow per unit area under a hydraulic gradient specific yield is a dimensionless ratio of water drainable by saturated aquifer material to the total volume of that material the hydraulic conductivity comes from spatially coarse pilot points digitized by clark et al 2013 return flows are the proportion of irrigation water that returns to the aquifer and this depends on the irrigated crop and irrigation practice for flood irrigated rice over clay soils 15 of total irrigated water returns to the groundwater kim et al 2009 furrow irrigated soybean and corn on loamy and sandy soils have a return flow of 20 poch massegu et al 2014 the alternative irrigation practices have a lower proportion of return flow of 10 since these practices use irrigation water more efficiently and therefore less irrigation water returns to the aquifer poch massegu et al 2014 3 2 farm production table s2 shows the cost per acre to produce each crop excluding irrigation costs which come from the 2010 2015 crop cost of production estimates from the university of arkansas division of agriculture 2017 the costs of irrigation include fuel lube and oil irrigation labor and poly pipe for furrow irrigation plus the levee gates for the flood irrigation of rice which are all dependent on the amount of water pumped hogan et al 2007 capital costs of irrigation include the wells pumps gearheads and power units and depend on the lifespan the amount of water pumped using that capital the irrigation water applied to crops excluding natural rainfall during the growing season comes from the university of arkansas division of agriculture 2017 crop prices are determined by using the fifteen year average annual prices paid for each crop using nass data from 2000 to 2015 usda 2018 the cost of diesel fuel depends on the amount of fuel to pump the water a unit depth from the water table hogan et al 2007 eia 2015 electricity is another common fuel source in the eastern arkanas but we assume only the use of diesel fuel here the parameters in table s2 are constant in inflation adjusted terms over time since model trade offs are hard to follow if prices yields and production costs also change over time the buffer value of groundwater is calculated as the certainty equivalent value for a unit of groundwater for irrigated soybeans over an average growing season kovacs et al 2015 tsur 1990 soybeans have lower net returns and yield sensitivity to irrigation than corn or rice and the buffer value of groundwater based on soybeans is therefore a low end estimate 3 3 irrigation practices furrow irrigation is the conventional irrigation practice for soybean and corn in eastern arkansas poly pipe transports water along the edge of the field to each furrow and the field is precision graded for effective drainage the alternative irrigation practice for soybean and corn is the row crop irrigation science and extension research riser program developed by agronomy researchers at mississippi state university the program uses a combination of soil sensors computerized poly pipe hole selection and surge valves mississippi state university extension 2013 computerized hole selection uses pipe elevation flow rate friction and pressure to calculate hole sizes in poly pipe for the uniform application of water with the freely available pipe hole and universal crown evaluation tool computer program soil moisture sensors assess the crop water balance and surge valves advance water down the furrow faster by the pulsing of the water rather constant flow contour levee flood irrigation is the conventional irrigation practice for rice in eastern arkansas the difference in levee elevation is usually small unless narrow distances between levees are a problem for the combine operation the alternative irrigation practice for rice is zero grade flood irrigation typically a zero grade field has a grade of 0 1 percent in one direction to permit drainage and reduce water use hignight et al 2009 both the riser program and the zero grade irrigation practices alter water use and production costs relative to conventional irrigation techniques table s3 in the supporting information shows the adjustment coefficients of the conventional practices the decrease in water use with the alternative irrigation practices is 40 for rice university of arkansas division of agriculture 2016 and corn and almost 30 for soybean krutz et al 2016 the increase in production costs for the alternative irrigation practices are 5 for rice hignight et al 2009 and 3 for both corn and soybean mississippi state university 2016 our model supposes only conventional irrigation practices are in use initially on the landscape because there is no spatial information about where alternative practices are in use 3 4 rate of adoption table 1 indicates the values for the adoption rate parameters in eqs 5 8 these values for irrigation practice adoption come from studies within the country anderson et al 1999 pfeiffer and lin 2014 and within the state edwards 2016 scenario 1 has the slowest adoption with a rate of acceptance of 0 1 and a ceiling of 15 adoption middle range adoption scenarios 2 and 3 have a rate of acceptance of 0 15 and a ceiling value of 30 adoption and a rate of acceptance of 0 2 and a ceiling for adoption is 45 respectively the fastest adoption scenario 4 has a rate of acceptance of 0 25 and a ceiling of 60 adoption all the scenarios use an origin acceptance level of 10 a 2015 survey about irrigation in the mississippi delta region of the united states indicates that 20 and 30 of producers adopted zero grade leveling or computerized hole selection respectively on some of their land and most of this adoption occurred over the last ten years edwards 2016 thus for these practices the adoption scenarios 2 and 3 appear the most representative of actual adoption rates on the arkansas landscape 4 results and discussion landscape outcomes in crop use irrigation practices and economic returns in the final period for the no adoption model compare to the outcomes for the model scenarios that allow adoption of alternative irrigation practices table 2 in the absence of adoption there are no alternative irrigated crop acres and conventionally irrigated soybeans are the predominant crop on the landscape the landscape without alternative irrigation practices leads to an aquifer volume of 58 47 million acre feet maf with the slowest rate of adoption scenario 1 producers grow alternative irrigated crops on the landscape despite the use of alternative irrigation practices the aquifer volume in this scenario decreases slightly to 58 03 maf because overall irrigated acres increase the irrigation water applied per acre decreases only slightly and the return flows decrease at a low adoption rate there is a re bound effect where the change in crop patterns from irrigation practice adoption results in greater groundwater use the adoption of the alternative irrigation practices results in a median return on investment roi of 3 11 the roi is positive in scenario 1 because more irrigated crops are grown and this increases economic returns by 10 from 1 76 billion to 1 84 billion faster adoption in scenario 2 causes alternative irrigated acres to increase and occupy a greater proportion of the landscape this leads to an increase in aquifer volume of 58 36 maf this trend continues in scenarios 3 and 4 where the aquifer volume increases to 59 12 and 59 82 maf respectively the increase in the aquifer and the lower depth to the aquifer with the faster adoption lowers the cost of pumping the groundwater the lower cost of well pumping reduces the roi because the alternative irrigation practices raise production costs but provide less irrigation pumping cost savings the roi in scenario 2 declines to 2 98 and scenarios 3 and 4 have a median roi of 2 84 and 2 70 respectively faster adoption of efficient irrigation technologies always increase economic returns but the change in the aquifer volume is not obvious at a low rate of adoption the increase in irrigated cropland can make groundwater use increase although the average water applied per irrigated acre falls however when faster adoption allows a larger proportion of landscape to use the alternative irrigation practices then groundwater use does fall the median roi consistently falls with faster adoption but the decline is not substantial in scenario 4 where nearly 39 of the landscape uses alternative irrigated acres the roi is still greater than two the incentive for producers to invest in alternative irrigation practices remains strong even as groundwater levels stabilize 4 1 the effects of time horizon length table 3 compares the adoption scenarios 1 and 4 for the 15 year and 60 year time horizons to the same adoption scenarios for the baseline time horizon presenting the results for scenario 1 the slowest adoption rate and scenario 4 the fastest adoption rate emphasizes how the adoption rate influences the results we do not show the middle adoption rates to keep the results concise and focus on what the sensitivity analysis tell us a shorter time horizon makes faster adoption of alternative irrigation practices less important for aquifer conservation the difference in aquifer volume between the scenarios 4 and 1 is 0 55 maf for the 15 year time horizon but 3 85 maf for 60 year time horizon fig 2 a indicates that the percentage change in aquifer volume compared to no adoption is negative i e the rebound effect in the adoption scenarios 1 and 2 for all the time horizons and this rebound effect persists with the faster adoption scenarios 3 and 4 for the 15 year horizon the rise in aquifer volume due to faster adoption is the largest for the 60 year time horizon and the lowest for the 15 year time horizon the aquifer conservation due to the alternative irrigation practice adoption is cumulative over time if policy makers and farm operators plan for a longer time horizon then rapid adoption is more effective for conservation the difference in the economics returns per year between the scenarios 4 and 1 is 5 8 million 6 4 million and 6 million for the 15 year 30 year and 60 year time horizons respectively the difference in economic returns per year are lowest for the 15 year horizon because a faster rate of adoption has less influence on economic returns when groundwater is still abundant however the economic returns per year are lower for the 60 year horizon than the 30 year horizon because faster adoption encourages alternative irrigation practice adoption in less profitable and less irrigation intensive soybean and corn fig 2b indicates that the percentage change in pv economic returns for all years compared to no adoption is the greatest for the 60 year horizon and lowest for the 15 year horizon and this difference widens with faster adoption the decline in roi with faster adoption is larger in the 60 year time horizon than the 15 year time horizon the difference in roi between the scenarios 4 and 1 is 0 14 for the 60 year time horizon but 0 34 for 15 year time horizon the roi falls more slowly in the 60 year horizon because the alternative irrigated crops replace relatively more non irrigated soybean and this allows the roi from the alternative irrigation to stay high 4 2 the effects of the initial depth to groundwater table 4 shows the model results for adoption scenarios 1 and 4 if all landscape sites have half the initial depth or double the initial depth when the depth to the groundwater is shallow the rate of adoption has less influence on aquifer conservation because adoption is minimal even when fast adoption is possible irrigation costs are low if the depth to the groundwater is shallow and the investment in water saving irrigation technologies is less worthwhile when the depth to the groundwater is high faster adoption means that alternative irrigated crops replace dryland crops and the conservation of the aquifer is modest the rate of adoption increases aquifer conservation more in the baseline depth model with an increase in 1 82 maf compared to 1 57 maf double depth and 0 83 maf half depth where faster adoption means alternative irrigated crops replace conventionally irrigated crops rather than dryland crops fig 2c shows that for the lowest adoption rates there is an aquifer rebound effect for all the initial depth scenarios as the adoption rate rises the double initial depth scenario is the quickest to show a percentage increase in aquifer volume followed by the baseline scenario when the initial depth is half the rebound effect leads to aquifer depletion with adoption except in the fastest adoption scenario the magnitude of the increase in economic returns with faster adoption relates directly to the depth to groundwater in the model with a significant depth to the groundwater faster adoption increases economic returns the most while in the model with a shallow depth to the aquifer faster adoption increases economic returns the least a greater depth to the aquifer corresponds to greater cost savings associated with faster adoption of irrigation practices for profitable crops fig 2d indicates that the greatest percentage increase in the pv of economic returns compared with no adoption occurs at double the initial depth because the fall in pumping costs significantly outweighs the higher capital costs the largest decline in roi with faster adoption is for the model with the baseline initial depth to the aquifer the aquifer volume increases the most with faster adoption in the model with the baseline initial depth and this reduces the roi the smallest decline in the roi occurs with the shallow baseline depth because aquifer volume rises the least in response to faster adoption 4 3 the effects of alternative crops margins table 5 shows the results for the adoption scenarios 1 and 4 for the baseline crop margin and for half and double the baseline crop margin the crop margin is the revenue per acre less the production costs without the irrigation component per acre halving the crop margin means either that revenue falls because of lower crop prices or yields while production costs remain the same or that production costs rise because of higher input prices while revenue remains the same or that both revenue falls and production costs increase as adoption increases from scenario 1 4 with the baseline margins there is a 1 8 maf increase in aquifer volume when crops have half the baseline margins there is an increase in aquifer volume by 0 9 maf as adoption rate increases the alternative irrigated crops replace dryland crops and this lowers the aquifer conservation when margins double the aquifer volume increases by 0 29 maf when margins double irrigation costs are relatively lower and producers have less incentive to use alternative irrigation technologies thus even at the fastest rate of adoption there is proportionally less alternative irrigated acres to conventionally irrigated acres and the aquifer conservation is minimal fig 2e shows that for double the crop margins the rebound effect persists except at the fastest adoption scenario because there is less incentive to use efficient irrigation technologies when pumping costs are a relatively small proportion of profits however when crop margins are half the percentage increase in aquifer volume is evident in all adoption scenarios because adoption is significant on the landscape fig 2f shows that the percentage increase in pv economic returns compared to no adoption is lowest with double crop margins and highest at half crop margins in accordance with the relative economic importance of the pumping costs faster adoption decreases roi in the baseline scenario than when margins are half or double the rate of decline in roi is the lowest when margins halve because the alternative irrigated crops replace low return dryland crops the model with the double margins has the largest decline in roi because the increase in the margins make conventionally irrigated crops more profitable relative to alternative irrigated crops in summary sensitivity analysis indicates that a 60 year model has greater adoption of alternative irrigation practices compared to the 15 year model groundwater levels stabilize more with rapid adoption if the time horizon is longer and the roi decline associated with the faster adoption rate is greater when halving and doubling the depth to groundwater faster adoption of the alternative practices has less impact on the aquifer conservation compared to the baseline scenario adoption has the greatest influence on economic returns when the depth to groundwater is double because efficient practices allow producers to grow more irrigation intensive and profitable crops faster adoption of efficient practices increase aquifer volume less when margins are half or double because efficiently irrigated rice replaces dryland crops or less irrigation intensive crops 4 4 groundwater conservation policies and the rate of adoption of irrigation practices the outcomes for the model with three policy options a cap and a tax on groundwater pumping and a subsidy to reduce the costs of the riser technology are shown for adoption scenarios 1 and 4 table 6 the most effective policy is the one that increases the aquifer at the lowest social cost the social cost is the change in economic returns plus the change in government revenue faster adoption increases aquifer volume in the baseline and with all the policies as the adoption rate increases from scenario 1 to 4 the aquifer increase in the baseline is 1 78 maf and the increase for the cap policy is 1 79 maf the tax policy increase is 1 86 maf and the subsidy policy has an increase of 1 82 maf the greater adoption of alternative practices with the subsidy policy generates the greatest increase in economic returns 214 million while the increase for the baseline cap policy and tax policy is 193 million 194 million and 195 million respectively this is due to the subsidy increasing profit with each additional acre of soybean and corn that uses the alternative irrigation practices the tax policy has the lowest decline in roi as adoption increases followed by the cap and baseline policies and then the subsidy policy the tax and cap policies do not make roi fall faster and thus do not seem to discourage investment in alternative irrigation practices the subsidy policy makes roi fall faster but the roi is also much higher with the subsidy the tax policy is the most cost effective 2 06 per acre foot af and 1 74 af for the low and high adoption rate scenarios followed by the subsidy policy 2 5 af and 16 25 af for the low and high adoption rate scenario and the cap policy 40 00 af and 25 af for the low and high adoption rate scenario faster adoption provides more options to respond to the rising groundwater costs that occur with the cap and tax policies and this increases the cost effectiveness of those policies producers might argue that the subsidy policy increases the roi and spurs faster adoption of the alternative irrigation but the government revenues are 12 million and 34 3 million for the low and high adoption scenarios respectively faster adoption decreases cost effectiveness because the subsidy is less effective at conservation once the most effective locations to adopt the alternative irrigation practices are taken however even at the faster adoption rate the subsidy policy is still more cost effective than the cap policy the groundwater conservation policies do not lower the roi of alternative irrigation practices the riser program subsidy policy in this study area slightly increases aquifer volume at a higher adoption rate contrary to the findings in other study areas by scheierling et al 2006 and ward and pulido velazquez 2008 who suggest that subsidies for alternative technologies will not conserve the aquifer the conservation of the aquifer with the subsidy is because less irrigation intensive corn and soybean acres increase the riser subsidy allows the greatest increase in economic returns and the cost effectiveness of the policy is better than the cap policy return on investment declines with faster adoption for all policies and the decline in the return on investment is the largest with the subsidy policy 5 conclusion our modeling indicates that the rate of adoption has to be fast to achieve groundwater conservation on the landscape in the lowest adoption rate scenario the aquifer volume declines because more land enters crops that are irrigation intensive this is consistent with findings that efficient irrigation practices do not always conserve water pfeiffer and lin 2014 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 however as the adoption rate increases the aquifer volume also increases because a greater proportion of the cropland uses efficient irrigation practices faster adoption decreases the return on investment because stabilizing or increasing the aquifer volume lowers the groundwater pumping costs regardless of the adoption scenario producers still have a strong economic incentive to continue adopting the efficient irrigation practices as the groundwater levels stabilize agricultural producers have the most to gain from efficient irrigation practices if the planning horizon is long the initial depth to the aquifer is large and the crop margins are tight thus when those conditions hold faster adoption increases the groundwater conservation and economic returns the most the cost effectiveness of policies to conserve the aquifer depend on the rate of adoption the subsidy for the riser program for soybean and corn and a tax on well pumping have similar cost effectiveness at the lowest adoption rate the tax on well pumping remains very cost effective at the fastest adoption rate but the subsidy becomes more costly for society our results are consistent with peterson and ding 2005 who find that incentives for technology adoption can reduce groundwater use and increase economic returns taylor and zilberman 2017 find that greater water costs increase adoption and adoption occurs initially on land with limited water availability and where profitable crops are grown our sensitivity analyses for double initial depth and baseline crop margins indicate greater adoption on the landscape ding and peterson 2012 find that conventional irrigation methods persist because the economic gains of adopting alternative practices are not enough to offset the capital costs and this occurs most frequently for the alternative soybean and corn irrigation this paper does not aim to predict future land and water use choices instead we examine the outcomes of potential adoption scenarios of efficient irrigation practices uncertainty and partially irreversible investment are some of the reasons for the slow adoption of alternative technologies baerenklau and knapp 2007 and these would influence the shape of s shaped diffusion model we do not model the micro foundations for the diffusion process but treat these as exogenous limitations to the modelling also include static weather patterns and constant risk of disease to crops and soil quality over time the model does not account for spatially variable adoption rates or the potential of other water sources such as off and on farm surface water to influence irrigation on the landscape future research might also incorporate alternative climate scenarios conflict of interest the authors

6645,the rate of adoption of efficient irrigation practices influences the return on investment from those practices and affects how much and even whether aquifer conservation occurs a spatial dynamic programming model for an agricultural landscape indicates that as the rate of adoption increases the return on investment gradually decreases as groundwater levels rise in eastern arkansas usa the model results also show that slow adoption can increase aquifer depletion because there is a switch to irrigation intensive crops but fast adoption can conserve the aquifer because a larger proportion of the crops use less irrigation water even the fastest adoption rate should not dissuade future adoption because the return on investment in the efficient irrigation practices remains high at low adoption rates a subsidy of efficient irrigation practices for the least irrigation intensive crop is almost as cost effective for groundwater conservation as a tax on well pumping at high adoption rates only a tax on well pumping is very cost effective keywords irrigation return on investment rate of adoption 1 introduction concerns about groundwater availability and irrigation costs motivate the development of more efficient irrigation practices pfeiffer and lin 2014 such practices may conserve groundwater but also must increase economic returns since producers make changes on the expectation of higher economic returns the cumulative proportion of alternative irrigation practices on the landscape over time often follows an s shaped logistic function anderson et al 1999 griliches 1957 the s shaped function for the adoption rate means that adoption grows slowly initially then exponentially for a short period and then grows slowly again for the remainder of the time horizon to a ceiling adoption value conceptually the explanation for the s shaped function of diffusion was initially described as a process of imitation rogers 1962 but later as a more complex result of the economic choices among heterogeneous agents sunding and zilberman 2001 while the economics literature of irrigation practices is significant schaible and aillery 2012 there are few studies about how the rate of adoption affects aquifer depletion regional economics returns and the return on investment in irrigation practices griliches 1957 examines the adoption of hybrid corn across the united states introducing the idea of the s shaped function of adoption that includes an origin rate of acceptance and ceiling for adoption of new technology or practices anderson et al 1999 examines the adoption of precision leveling for cotton production over a twenty year period in arizona the adoption of the precision leveling follows an s shaped pattern with an adoption ceiling of 70 in the current application faster adoption may conserve the aquifer since the application of water to crops is less than before but the associated switch to more irrigation intensive crops and loss of return flows may diminish the aquifer the economic returns to the producers should rise due to the use of more efficient practices but the pace of the rise depends on what happens to groundwater levels the change in the return on investment in irrigation practices determines whether the adoption of these efficient irrigation practices will persist the return on investment may slow if faster adoption raises groundwater levels thereby lowering well pumping costs while the capital costs remain high studies of efficient irrigation practices generally indicate that adoption increases operating profits measured as revenue less variable inputs but raises the capital costs caswell and zilberman 1986 suggest that efficient practices are more likely where water holding capacity is low and there are higher crop or water prices further if adoption increases yield enough then efficient irrigation practices can actually raise the water demand of a crop with new land in production or a switch to more irrigation intensive crops the adoption of efficient practices is also able to increase water demand pfeiffer and lin 2014 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 in addition efficient irrigation practices can lower return flows and may limit aquifer recharge johnson et al 1999 the influence of the efficient irrigation practices on groundwater use is therefore not straightforward because of changes in the crop mix and return flows an analysis of the rate of adoption of irrigation practices on an agricultural landscape can provide insight into when efficient irrigation is good for groundwater conservation a spatial dynamic model of the agricultural landscape in eastern arkansas compares the rate of adoption of efficient irrigation practices with conventional irrigation practices to understand water conservation and the return on investment in those irrigation practices each efficient irrigation practice differs from the conventional irrigation practice in terms of the water consumption of the crops and the irrigation capital costs the water consumption of crops with efficient irrigation are lower but the capital costs are higher the return on investment in efficient irrigation practices change in response to the rate of adoption scenarios the aggregation to the landscape of the site level choices allow for an examination of aggregate aquifer depletion and economic returns for producers on the landscape arkansas has 9 of all irrigated acres and more than 7 of irrigated water applied in the united states usda 2013 reliance on the irrigation water from the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer prompted the 2014 arkansas water plan to recommend more efficient irrigation practices anrc 2014 such practices include the mississippi state university s row crop irrigation science and extension research riser program for soybean and corn production and zero grade leveling for rice production in 2013 roughly 36 of farms and 45 of irrigated acres in arkansas use at least one efficient irrigation practice usda 2013 the most common practice is precision leveling or zero grade leveling with 22 of all irrigated acres followed by tailwater pits diking time limits or alternative row irrigation with 18 of all irrigated acres producers face multiple barriers in adopting efficient irrigation practices but the main reason from the u s agricultural census is that investigating improvements is not a priority and 34 of farms cite this reason more than half of producers indicate they rely on extension agents or university specialists for reducing irrigation costs or conserving water usda 2013 the methods for modeling the land use irrigation and rate of efficient irrigation practice adoption are in the next section the methods section also describes the sensitivity analyses and the policy scenarios the following section provides detail on the data to parameterize the model components the results and discussion sections explains the findings of the models and the concluding remarks summarize the findings and relates them to the literature 2 methods the model we develop examines how the rate of adoption of efficient irrigation practices influences groundwater conservation economic returns and the return on investment in efficient irrigation the objective agricultural producers follow is to maximize economic returns initially we describe the constraints producers face in pursuit of this objective because the choice variables producers use to maximize economic returns have useful context in constraints on land crop types irrigation practices and water resources the model makes choices over land use and irrigation practices for each site i of the m available sites the land constraint eq 1 only allows for

practices called riser for soybean and corn the crop type and irrigation practice at a given period t for each site i is lijk t the allowable amount of land in each crop type at a site is proportional to the original amount land in each crop at the site the proportion depends on the average historical amount of land in each crop type within the study area these constraints reflect unobservable agronomic features on the landscape that make the likelihood very low that only one crop is on a site since these crops typically rotate with soybeans 2 1 irrigation choices the amount of water

agricultural producers using the practice automatically continue the practice and the associated annualized capital costs after the life span of the practice is complete and the investments are

choices as a social planner rather than as a myopic competitive producer an extensive literature compares the differences between socially optimal and competitive models of groundwater use koundouri 2004 and these generally indicate a difference in net returns between 4 and 5 provencher and burt 1994 2 4 return on investment and sensitivity analyses the return on investment of the irrigation technology adoption for each crop is the difference in economic profit at each site with and without adoption and then dividing this by the aggregate costs of adopting the alternative irrigation practice at each site the use of the median value of all the sites for each model run reduces the influence of outlier return on investment values sensitivity analysis of key parameters help in the study of the model results first halving and doubling the time horizon allows us to observe how the length of the time horizon influences outcomes the length of the time horizon influences how valuable the adoption of the practices will be which affects the economic returns and aquifer depletion second there is the halving and doubling of the initial depth to groundwater because the cost of groundwater pumping is a key factor in the use of alternative irrigation practices finally the halving and doubling of the margins for each crop allow us to see how the boom and bust cycles of crop or input prices could influence the use of alternative irrigation practices at different adoption rates the crop margin is the revenue less the production cost excluding irrigation cost per acre each sensitivity analysis compares outcomes for the baseline results to the outcomes for the slowest and fastest rate of adoption scenarios 2 5 policies the policy options for groundwater conservation include a cap on groundwater use a tax groundwater pumping and a cost share on an alternative package of irrigation practices for corn and soybean known as the riser system the limit on groundwater use at each site i is for pumping to be 60 less than the current groundwater use at each site i for each period a tax on groundwater pumping of 2 achieves groundwater conservation similar to the cap on groundwater use the cost share for the riser system irrigation scheduling tool soil moisture sensors surge valves and poly pipe planner is set at 60 based on the rates from the natural resource conservation service s nrcs agricultural water enhancement program nrcs 2014 3 data the study area has 2724 sites across 11 counties in arkansas kovacs and durand morat 2017 these sites are within three eight digit hydrological unit code huc watersheds fig 1 where unsustainable groundwater pumping has been occurring the initial crop acreage for each cell comes from the crop land data layer from 2017 johnson and mueller 2010 the land in irrigated versus non irrigated soybean acreage comes from the national agricultural statistic service nass data on harvested acreage for 2010 2011 usda 2018 additional details on crop acreage is in the supporting information table s1 average maximum acreages for each crop by county for the years 2001 2015 constrain the acreage of crops usda 2018 the average maximum percentage of land for each crop and each site is as follows rice 27 irrigated soybean 60 irrigated corn 20 and non irrigated soybean 20 the crop yield at the county level comes from nass usda 2018 a real discount rate of 2 comes from a 30 year treasury bond yield over the last decade of 5 minus an expected inflation rate of 3 u s department of the treasury 2018 3 1 groundwater use recharge and return flows the depth to the water table and the initial saturated volume of the aquifer come from the arkansas natural resources commission anrc 2010 and summary statistics for these data are in table s1 of the supporting information the well pumping of the aquifer causes the saturated volume to decline the initial size of the aquifer is the product of the saturated thickness of the aquifer multiplied by land area a calibrated model of recharge from 1994 to 1998 from natural precipitation and surface streams determines the natural recharge nri of the alluvial aquifer reed 2003 the hydraulic diffusivity divided by the square of the shortest distance between the pumped well and the nearby aquifer defines how much pumping from a nearby well depletes the aquifer hydraulic diffusivity is the ratio of the transmissivity and the specific yield of the unconfined alluvial aquifer barlow and leake 2012 transmissivity is the product of hydraulic conductivity and saturated volume and the hydraulic conductivity is the rate of groundwater flow per unit area under a hydraulic gradient specific yield is a dimensionless ratio of water drainable by saturated aquifer material to the total volume of that material the hydraulic conductivity comes from spatially coarse pilot points digitized by clark et al 2013 return flows are the proportion of irrigation water that returns to the aquifer and this depends on the irrigated crop and irrigation practice for flood irrigated rice over clay soils 15 of total irrigated water returns to the groundwater kim et al 2009 furrow irrigated soybean and corn on loamy and sandy soils have a return flow of 20 poch massegu et al 2014 the alternative irrigation practices have a lower proportion of return flow of 10 since these practices use irrigation water more efficiently and therefore less irrigation water returns to the aquifer poch massegu et al 2014 3 2 farm production table s2 shows the cost per acre to produce each crop excluding irrigation costs which come from the 2010 2015 crop cost of production estimates from the university of arkansas division of agriculture 2017 the costs of irrigation include fuel lube and oil irrigation labor and poly pipe for furrow irrigation plus the levee gates for the flood irrigation of rice which are all dependent on the amount of water pumped hogan et al 2007 capital costs of irrigation include the wells pumps gearheads and power units and depend on the lifespan the amount of water pumped using that capital the irrigation water applied to crops excluding natural rainfall during the growing season comes from the university of arkansas division of agriculture 2017 crop prices are determined by using the fifteen year average annual prices paid for each crop using nass data from 2000 to 2015 usda 2018 the cost of diesel fuel depends on the amount of fuel to pump the water a unit depth from the water table hogan et al 2007 eia 2015 electricity is another common fuel source in the eastern arkanas but we assume only the use of diesel fuel here the parameters in table s2 are constant in inflation adjusted terms over time since model trade offs are hard to follow if prices yields and production costs also change over time the buffer value of groundwater is calculated as the certainty equivalent value for a unit of groundwater for irrigated soybeans over an average growing season kovacs et al 2015 tsur 1990 soybeans have lower net returns and yield sensitivity to irrigation than corn or rice and the buffer value of groundwater based on soybeans is therefore a low end estimate 3 3 irrigation practices furrow irrigation is the conventional irrigation practice for soybean and corn in eastern arkansas poly pipe transports water along the edge of the field to each furrow and the field is precision graded for effective drainage the alternative irrigation practice for soybean and corn is the row crop irrigation science and extension research riser program developed by agronomy researchers at mississippi state university the program uses a combination of soil sensors computerized poly pipe hole selection and surge valves mississippi state university extension 2013 computerized hole selection uses pipe elevation flow rate friction and pressure to calculate hole sizes in poly pipe for the uniform application of water with the freely available pipe hole and universal crown evaluation tool computer program soil moisture sensors assess the crop water balance and surge valves advance water down the furrow faster by the pulsing of the water rather constant flow contour levee flood irrigation is the conventional irrigation practice for rice in eastern arkansas the difference in levee elevation is usually small unless narrow distances between levees are a problem for the combine operation the alternative irrigation practice for rice is zero grade flood irrigation typically a zero grade field has a grade of 0 1 percent in one direction to permit drainage and reduce water use hignight et al 2009 both the riser program and the zero grade irrigation practices alter water use and production costs relative to conventional irrigation techniques table s3 in the supporting information shows the adjustment coefficients of the conventional practices the decrease in water use with the alternative irrigation practices is 40 for rice university of arkansas division of agriculture 2016 and corn and almost 30 for soybean krutz et al 2016 the increase in production costs for the alternative irrigation practices are 5 for rice hignight et al 2009 and 3 for both corn and soybean mississippi state university 2016 our model supposes only conventional irrigation practices are in use initially on the landscape because there is no spatial information about where alternative practices are in use 3 4 rate of adoption table 1 indicates the values for the adoption rate parameters in eqs 5 8 these values for irrigation practice adoption come from studies within the country anderson et al 1999 pfeiffer and lin 2014 and within the state edwards 2016 scenario 1 has the slowest adoption with a rate of acceptance of 0 1 and a ceiling of 15 adoption middle range adoption scenarios 2 and 3 have a rate of acceptance of 0 15 and a ceiling value of 30 adoption and a rate of acceptance of 0 2 and a ceiling for adoption is 45 respectively the fastest adoption scenario 4 has a rate of acceptance of 0 25 and a ceiling of 60 adoption all the scenarios use an origin acceptance level of 10 a 2015 survey about irrigation in the mississippi delta region of the united states indicates that 20 and 30 of producers adopted zero grade leveling or computerized hole selection respectively on some of their land and most of this adoption occurred over the last ten years edwards 2016 thus for these practices the adoption scenarios 2 and 3 appear the most representative of actual adoption rates on the arkansas landscape 4 results and discussion landscape outcomes in crop use irrigation practices and economic returns in the final period for the no adoption model compare to the outcomes for the model scenarios that allow adoption of alternative irrigation practices table 2 in the absence of adoption there are no alternative irrigated crop acres and conventionally irrigated soybeans are the predominant crop on the landscape the landscape without alternative irrigation practices leads to an aquifer volume of 58 47 million acre feet maf with the slowest rate of adoption scenario 1 producers grow alternative irrigated crops on the landscape despite the use of alternative irrigation practices the aquifer volume in this scenario decreases slightly to 58 03 maf because overall irrigated acres increase the irrigation water applied per acre decreases only slightly and the return flows decrease at a low adoption rate there is a re bound effect where the change in crop patterns from irrigation practice adoption results in greater groundwater use the adoption of the alternative irrigation practices results in a median return on investment roi of 3 11 the roi is positive in scenario 1 because more irrigated crops are grown and this increases economic returns by 10 from 1 76 billion to 1 84 billion faster adoption in scenario 2 causes alternative irrigated acres to increase and occupy a greater proportion of the landscape this leads to an increase in aquifer volume of 58 36 maf this trend continues in scenarios 3 and 4 where the aquifer volume increases to 59 12 and 59 82 maf respectively the increase in the aquifer and the lower depth to the aquifer with the faster adoption lowers the cost of pumping the groundwater the lower cost of well pumping reduces the roi because the alternative irrigation practices raise production costs but provide less irrigation pumping cost savings the roi in scenario 2 declines to 2 98 and scenarios 3 and 4 have a median roi of 2 84 and 2 70 respectively faster adoption of efficient irrigation technologies always increase economic returns but the change in the aquifer volume is not obvious at a low rate of adoption the increase in irrigated cropland can make groundwater use increase although the average water applied per irrigated acre falls however when faster adoption allows a larger proportion of landscape to use the alternative irrigation practices then groundwater use does fall the median roi consistently falls with faster adoption but the decline is not substantial in scenario 4 where nearly 39 of the landscape uses alternative irrigated acres the roi is still greater than two the incentive for producers to invest in alternative irrigation practices remains strong even as groundwater levels stabilize 4 1 the effects of time horizon length table 3 compares the adoption scenarios 1 and 4 for the 15 year and 60 year time horizons to the same adoption scenarios for the baseline time horizon presenting the results for scenario 1 the slowest adoption rate and scenario 4 the fastest adoption rate emphasizes how the adoption rate influences the results we do not show the middle adoption rates to keep the results concise and focus on what the sensitivity analysis tell us a shorter time horizon makes faster adoption of alternative irrigation practices less important for aquifer conservation the difference in aquifer volume between the scenarios 4 and 1 is 0 55 maf for the 15 year time horizon but 3 85 maf for 60 year time horizon fig 2 a indicates that the percentage change in aquifer volume compared to no adoption is negative i e the rebound effect in the adoption scenarios 1 and 2 for all the time horizons and this rebound effect persists with the faster adoption scenarios 3 and 4 for the 15 year horizon the rise in aquifer volume due to faster adoption is the largest for the 60 year time horizon and the lowest for the 15 year time horizon the aquifer conservation due to the alternative irrigation practice adoption is cumulative over time if policy makers and farm operators plan for a longer time horizon then rapid adoption is more effective for conservation the difference in the economics returns per year between the scenarios 4 and 1 is 5 8 million 6 4 million and 6 million for the 15 year 30 year and 60 year time horizons respectively the difference in economic returns per year are lowest for the 15 year horizon because a faster rate of adoption has less influence on economic returns when groundwater is still abundant however the economic returns per year are lower for the 60 year horizon than the 30 year horizon because faster adoption encourages alternative irrigation practice adoption in less profitable and less irrigation intensive soybean and corn fig 2b indicates that the percentage change in pv economic returns for all years compared to no adoption is the greatest for the 60 year horizon and lowest for the 15 year horizon and this difference widens with faster adoption the decline in roi with faster adoption is larger in the 60 year time horizon than the 15 year time horizon the difference in roi between the scenarios 4 and 1 is 0 14 for the 60 year time horizon but 0 34 for 15 year time horizon the roi falls more slowly in the 60 year horizon because the alternative irrigated crops replace relatively more non irrigated soybean and this allows the roi from the alternative irrigation to stay high 4 2 the effects of the initial depth to groundwater table 4 shows the model results for adoption scenarios 1 and 4 if all landscape sites have half the initial depth or double the initial depth when the depth to the groundwater is shallow the rate of adoption has less influence on aquifer conservation because adoption is minimal even when fast adoption is possible irrigation costs are low if the depth to the groundwater is shallow and the investment in water saving irrigation technologies is less worthwhile when the depth to the groundwater is high faster adoption means that alternative irrigated crops replace dryland crops and the conservation of the aquifer is modest the rate of adoption increases aquifer conservation more in the baseline depth model with an increase in 1 82 maf compared to 1 57 maf double depth and 0 83 maf half depth where faster adoption means alternative irrigated crops replace conventionally irrigated crops rather than dryland crops fig 2c shows that for the lowest adoption rates there is an aquifer rebound effect for all the initial depth scenarios as the adoption rate rises the double initial depth scenario is the quickest to show a percentage increase in aquifer volume followed by the baseline scenario when the initial depth is half the rebound effect leads to aquifer depletion with adoption except in the fastest adoption scenario the magnitude of the increase in economic returns with faster adoption relates directly to the depth to groundwater in the model with a significant depth to the groundwater faster adoption increases economic returns the most while in the model with a shallow depth to the aquifer faster adoption increases economic returns the least a greater depth to the aquifer corresponds to greater cost savings associated with faster adoption of irrigation practices for profitable crops fig 2d indicates that the greatest percentage increase in the pv of economic returns compared with no adoption occurs at double the initial depth because the fall in pumping costs significantly outweighs the higher capital costs the largest decline in roi with faster adoption is for the model with the baseline initial depth to the aquifer the aquifer volume increases the most with faster adoption in the model with the baseline initial depth and this reduces the roi the smallest decline in the roi occurs with the shallow baseline depth because aquifer volume rises the least in response to faster adoption 4 3 the effects of alternative crops margins table 5 shows the results for the adoption scenarios 1 and 4 for the baseline crop margin and for half and double the baseline crop margin the crop margin is the revenue per acre less the production costs without the irrigation component per acre halving the crop margin means either that revenue falls because of lower crop prices or yields while production costs remain the same or that production costs rise because of higher input prices while revenue remains the same or that both revenue falls and production costs increase as adoption increases from scenario 1 4 with the baseline margins there is a 1 8 maf increase in aquifer volume when crops have half the baseline margins there is an increase in aquifer volume by 0 9 maf as adoption rate increases the alternative irrigated crops replace dryland crops and this lowers the aquifer conservation when margins double the aquifer volume increases by 0 29 maf when margins double irrigation costs are relatively lower and producers have less incentive to use alternative irrigation technologies thus even at the fastest rate of adoption there is proportionally less alternative irrigated acres to conventionally irrigated acres and the aquifer conservation is minimal fig 2e shows that for double the crop margins the rebound effect persists except at the fastest adoption scenario because there is less incentive to use efficient irrigation technologies when pumping costs are a relatively small proportion of profits however when crop margins are half the percentage increase in aquifer volume is evident in all adoption scenarios because adoption is significant on the landscape fig 2f shows that the percentage increase in pv economic returns compared to no adoption is lowest with double crop margins and highest at half crop margins in accordance with the relative economic importance of the pumping costs faster adoption decreases roi in the baseline scenario than when margins are half or double the rate of decline in roi is the lowest when margins halve because the alternative irrigated crops replace low return dryland crops the model with the double margins has the largest decline in roi because the increase in the margins make conventionally irrigated crops more profitable relative to alternative irrigated crops in summary sensitivity analysis indicates that a 60 year model has greater adoption of alternative irrigation practices compared to the 15 year model groundwater levels stabilize more with rapid adoption if the time horizon is longer and the roi decline associated with the faster adoption rate is greater when halving and doubling the depth to groundwater faster adoption of the alternative practices has less impact on the aquifer conservation compared to the baseline scenario adoption has the greatest influence on economic returns when the depth to groundwater is double because efficient practices allow producers to grow more irrigation intensive and profitable crops faster adoption of efficient practices increase aquifer volume less when margins are half or double because efficiently irrigated rice replaces dryland crops or less irrigation intensive crops 4 4 groundwater conservation policies and the rate of adoption of irrigation practices the outcomes for the model with three policy options a cap and a tax on groundwater pumping and a subsidy to reduce the costs of the riser technology are shown for adoption scenarios 1 and 4 table 6 the most effective policy is the one that increases the aquifer at the lowest social cost the social cost is the change in economic returns plus the change in government revenue faster adoption increases aquifer volume in the baseline and with all the policies as the adoption rate increases from scenario 1 to 4 the aquifer increase in the baseline is 1 78 maf and the increase for the cap policy is 1 79 maf the tax policy increase is 1 86 maf and the subsidy policy has an increase of 1 82 maf the greater adoption of alternative practices with the subsidy policy generates the greatest increase in economic returns 214 million while the increase for the baseline cap policy and tax policy is 193 million 194 million and 195 million respectively this is due to the subsidy increasing profit with each additional acre of soybean and corn that uses the alternative irrigation practices the tax policy has the lowest decline in roi as adoption increases followed by the cap and baseline policies and then the subsidy policy the tax and cap policies do not make roi fall faster and thus do not seem to discourage investment in alternative irrigation practices the subsidy policy makes roi fall faster but the roi is also much higher with the subsidy the tax policy is the most cost effective 2 06 per acre foot af and 1 74 af for the low and high adoption rate scenarios followed by the subsidy policy 2 5 af and 16 25 af for the low and high adoption rate scenario and the cap policy 40 00 af and 25 af for the low and high adoption rate scenario faster adoption provides more options to respond to the rising groundwater costs that occur with the cap and tax policies and this increases the cost effectiveness of those policies producers might argue that the subsidy policy increases the roi and spurs faster adoption of the alternative irrigation but the government revenues are 12 million and 34 3 million for the low and high adoption scenarios respectively faster adoption decreases cost effectiveness because the subsidy is less effective at conservation once the most effective locations to adopt the alternative irrigation practices are taken however even at the faster adoption rate the subsidy policy is still more cost effective than the cap policy the groundwater conservation policies do not lower the roi of alternative irrigation practices the riser program subsidy policy in this study area slightly increases aquifer volume at a higher adoption rate contrary to the findings in other study areas by scheierling et al 2006 and ward and pulido velazquez 2008 who suggest that subsidies for alternative technologies will not conserve the aquifer the conservation of the aquifer with the subsidy is because less irrigation intensive corn and soybean acres increase the riser subsidy allows the greatest increase in economic returns and the cost effectiveness of the policy is better than the cap policy return on investment declines with faster adoption for all policies and the decline in the return on investment is the largest with the subsidy policy 5 conclusion our modeling indicates that the rate of adoption has to be fast to achieve groundwater conservation on the landscape in the lowest adoption rate scenario the aquifer volume declines because more land enters crops that are irrigation intensive this is consistent with findings that efficient irrigation practices do not always conserve water pfeiffer and lin 2014 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 however as the adoption rate increases the aquifer volume also increases because a greater proportion of the cropland uses efficient irrigation practices faster adoption decreases the return on investment because stabilizing or increasing the aquifer volume lowers the groundwater pumping costs regardless of the adoption scenario producers still have a strong economic incentive to continue adopting the efficient irrigation practices as the groundwater levels stabilize agricultural producers have the most to gain from efficient irrigation practices if the planning horizon is long the initial depth to the aquifer is large and the crop margins are tight thus when those conditions hold faster adoption increases the groundwater conservation and economic returns the most the cost effectiveness of policies to conserve the aquifer depend on the rate of adoption the subsidy for the riser program for soybean and corn and a tax on well pumping have similar cost effectiveness at the lowest adoption rate the tax on well pumping remains very cost effective at the fastest adoption rate but the subsidy becomes more costly for society our results are consistent with peterson and ding 2005 who find that incentives for technology adoption can reduce groundwater use and increase economic returns taylor and zilberman 2017 find that greater water costs increase adoption and adoption occurs initially on land with limited water availability and where profitable crops are grown our sensitivity analyses for double initial depth and baseline crop margins indicate greater adoption on the landscape ding and peterson 2012 find that conventional irrigation methods persist because the economic gains of adopting alternative practices are not enough to offset the capital costs and this occurs most frequently for the alternative soybean and corn irrigation this paper does not aim to predict future land and water use choices instead we examine the outcomes of potential adoption scenarios of efficient irrigation practices uncertainty and partially irreversible investment are some of the reasons for the slow adoption of alternative technologies baerenklau and knapp 2007 and these would influence the shape of s shaped diffusion model we do not model the micro foundations for the diffusion process but treat these as exogenous limitations to the modelling also include static weather patterns and constant risk of disease to crops and soil quality over time the model does not account for spatially variable adoption rates or the potential of other water sources such as off and on farm surface water to influence irrigation on the landscape future research might also incorporate alternative climate scenarios conflict of interest the authors

6646,a first order moment analysis is developed to investigate the temporal and spatial propagation of uncertainty of slope stability during rainfall considering spatial variabilities in initial soil water pressure and soil hydraulic properties and temporal variability of rainfall results of the analysis indicate that the uncertainties resulting from variabilities in initial soil pore water pressure distributions and rainfalls are comparable with that from the variability in soil hydraulic properties further the evolution of slope stability uncertainty is driven by the mean flow field and a localized large uncertainty zone along the slope profile could form leading to a localized low reliability zone which may lead to the failure of the slope in particular when the slope is close to saturation the reliability of the stability analysis of any elevation of the slope is low even at early rainfall times on the other hand when the slope is unsaturated and heavy rainfalls occur the low reliability zone exists at shallow parts of the slope at early times the results also show that greater unreliability exists at shallow depths at early times when the rainfall has a descending trend in comparison with uniform and increasing trend lastly the low reliability zone is always near the impermeable bedrock if rainfall persists keywords slope stability uncertainty variability initial soil pore water pressure rainfall characteristics large uncertainty zone low reliability zone 1 introduction rainfall induced landslides are one of the most severe natural disasters ng and shi 1998 ng et al 2001 significant landslide disasters triggered by rainfalls have been reported annually in many parts of the world such as brazil italy south africa japan and china chowdhury and flentje 2002 infiltration of precipitation increases soil moisture content decreases matric suction of unsaturated soils or creates positive pore water pressure and in turn decreases the shear strength of soils and consequently leads to landslides preventions for geohazards such as slope failures and landslides therefore require reliable evaluations of slope stability under rainfall infiltrations rainfall induced landslides are attributed to geologic characteristics topography initial soil pore water pressure and precipitation of the slope area due to the heterogeneous nature of the geology and our inability to characterize them an increasing number of researches has focused on the variabilities of soil properties and their effects on the slope stability e g ali et al 2014 cai et al 2017a c d cho 2014 griffiths et al 2011 gui et al 2000 on the other hand precipitation and initial soil pore water pressure generally exhibit a high degree of temporal and spatial variabilities for instance it has been widely recognized that rainfall intensity is significantly higher on the escarpment relative to the coastal plain chowdhury and flentje 2002 in addition rainfall processes are known to vary widely in time that is spatiotemporal variability is an intrinsic characteristic of climate paolini et al 2005 furthermore the distribution of initial soil pore water pressures in the slope also varies spatially due to variabilities in prior rainfalls and heterogeneities of geology previous studies have focused on the variabilities in rainfalls or initial soil pore water pressure distributions for example d odorico 2005 showed that the temporal variations of rainfall intensity affect stability and the rainfall pattern with a peak at the end of the rainfall process has a stronger destabilizing effect than a constant rainfall minder et al 2009 studied the impact of spatial rainfall heterogeneity on landslide susceptibility based on a numerical model and pointed out that the heterogeneous rainfall decreased slope stability von ruette et al 2014 investigated the effects of rainfall variabilities and initial soil hydraulic conditions on the statistics of locations the numbers and the released volumes of landslides at a catchment they suggested that fewer landslides were triggered under dry initial soil conditions than the wet conditions and rainfall heterogeneity may be an important missing link required for landslide prediction since it is practically impossible to characterize the variabilities in initial soil pore water pressure and rainfalls in detail uncertainties in the evaluation of slope stability exist for this reason these variabilities deserve particular attention the understanding of these variabilities and their effects on slope stability is still relatively limited at present for instance in most studies rainfall data is obtained via spatially and temporally averaging approaches or interpolation using sparse rain gauge measurements or coarse rainfall radar information over large areas von ruette et al 2014 the initial soil pore water pressure is frequently assumed to be spatially invariant e g cho 2014 or to be those obtained by steady state simulations under antecedent rainfalls e g cai et al 2017b in these approaches the initial soil pore water pressure and rainfall are considered as deterministic and their uncertainties are ignored these simplifications lead to inaccurate predictions of landslides which hamper mitigation procedures during this rainfall infiltration process in a slope the effect of spatial variability in initial soil pore water pressure and soil properties and temporal varying rainfall on the slope stability evolves with time and space as a result it becomes important to know where and when the potential slip surfaces have relatively large uncertainties of their stabilities and whether these uncertainties are significant enough to impact the slope stability these issues are seldom investigated therefore we are compelled to conduct a probabilistic analysis of the interaction between temporal and spatial distributions of initial soil pore water pressures rainfalls soil properties and slope stability the primary objective of this study is to propose a stochastic approach for a better understanding and prediction of the temporal and spatial evolution of slope stability uncertainty caused by variabilities in initial soil pore water pressure distributions rainfalls and soil hydraulic properties and its importance in slope stability evaluations during rainfall this paper is organized as follows the basic equations for describing the one dimensional vertical seepage and evaluation of infinite slope stability and deterministic analysis of slope stability are presented in section 2 section 3 first presents the first order moment approach and the approach to quantitatively represent the spatial variability in initial hydraulic conditions and soil hydraulic properties and the temporal variability of rainfalls during the rainfall process then it describes a probabilistic analysis of slope stability simulation results for different scenarios are discussed in section 4 with respect to the effects of the initial soil pore water pressure rainfall intensity rainfall duration and rainfall pattern on uncertainty propagations of slope stability and the importance of these uncertainties on slope stability the article then draws conclusions in section 5 2 deterministic slope stability analysis under rainfall 2 1 governing equations for seepage analysis the rainfall infiltration process in the infinite slope fig 1 is assumed to be described by a one dimensional governing vertical flow equation yeh et al 2015 1 z k h h z 1 η s s c h h t where z denotes the coordinate along the vertical z axis positive upward h is the pressure head k h is the hydraulic conductivity s s is the specific storage c h denotes the moisture capacity term t denotes time η is the saturation index h is a positive value if the medium is fully saturated and is negative if the medium is unsaturated k h varies with pressure head under unsaturated conditions s s represents the percentage of water released from a unit volume of fully saturated porous media under a unit decline in hydraulic head on the other hand c h θ h h is the change in moisture content in a unit volume of the porous medium under a unit change of negative pressure head when the medium is unsaturated while s s and c h are similar in definition the physical mechanisms they represented are entirely different s s is related to the compressibility of porous media and water while the medium remains fully saturated whereas c h represents desaturation or saturation of the pores in the medium on the right hand side of eq 1 η is set to 1 if the medium is saturated and 0 if the medium is unsaturated eq 1 is subjected to an initial condition 2a h z 0 h 0 z where h 0 z is the prescribed pressure head at the location z at the initial time the boundary conditions for eq 1 are at the land surface a prescribed pressure head h b at the time t is assigned to the top boundary to represent rainfall for the infinite slope 2b h h t h b t while at slope base no flux boundary is utilized 2c k h h z 1 0 t 0 to simulate flow in a hillslope using the governing equation and its initial and

factor of safety along ith potential slip surface i e f s i of an infinite slope has been widely evaluated using the limit equilibrium model lem with the unified effective stress under both saturated and unsaturated conditions lu and godt 2008 if we let the pore air pressure u a be atmospheric pressure i e u a 0 f s i can be expressed as e g ali et al 2014 cho 2014 griffiths et al 2011 li et al

surfaces β is the slope inclination γ i is the averaged total unit weight above ith potential slip surface h denotes the vertical distance of soils from the slope base to the land surface c i and ϕ i are the effective cohesion and the effective soil friction angle at ith potential slip surface and z i is the elevation positive upward of ith potential slip surface see fig 1 σ i s represents the effective negative pore water pressure under unsaturated conditions or effective positive pore water pressure when under saturated conditions at ith potential slip surface lu and godt 2008 according to lu and godt 2008 σ i s can be expressed as 6 σ i s θ i θ r θ s θ r u a u wi s ei u a u wi where u wi s ei and θ i are the pore water pressure the effective water saturation and the volumetric moisture content at ith potential slip surface respectively the relationship between u w and h is u w h γ w σ i s s ei u wi 0 is for unsaturated conditions u wi 0 and σ i s u wi 0 is for saturated conditions u wi 0 via this unified effective stress theory eq 5 can account for both the reduction in matric suction and the development of positive pore water pressure in a continuous form cho 2014 lu and godt 2008 in this study the variation in unit weight resulting from changes in moisture content during infiltration is evaluated by integration of the moisture content profile above the potential slip surface that is the total unit weight γ i can be expressed as follows 7 γ i 1 h z i z i h γ d θ z γ w d z 0 z i h where γ d is the dry unit weight of the soil γ w is the unit weight of water 2 3 setup of model catastrophic shallow landslides frequently occur under heavy rainfall in weathered granite residual soil slopes in korea and the southeast coast of china the method developed here therefore is applied to the weathered granite residual soil slopes as an example generally the hillslope in these areas can be treated as an unsaturated shallow layered slope above an impermeable bedrock and the one dimensional infinite slope model is appropriate for the simulation e g ali et al 2014 cai et al 2017a c d cho 2014 griffiths et al 2011 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 the geometrical parameters and all the hydraulic and mechanical parameters for this investigation are listed in table 1 they are adopted from the data listed in cho 2014 which are representative of typical weathered granite soils in seochang korea the entire infinite slope is discretized into 40 elements in the vertical direction representing 40 potential slip surfaces i e n 40 with an interval δ z of 0 05 m these potential slip surfaces are numbered 1 to 40 from the slope base to the land surface see fig 1 in addition the initial pressure head distribution in the slope is described by h0 which is a function of z and an impermeable boundary is located at the slope base as rainfall occurs a specific pressure head h b which is a function of t is assigned to the top boundary to represent a variable rainfall a finite element analysis code available at http tian hwr arizona edu downloads yeh et al 1993 is employed to simulate the one dimensional vertical seepage described by eq 1 subjected to the initial and boundary conditions described by eq 2 subsequently computed vertical profiles of pore water pressure effective water saturation and moisture content from transient finite element seepage analyses are used as inputs for calculating f s i i 1 n at each time step by eq 5 2 4 deterministic analysis first a deterministic transient seepage analysis is conducted by using the mean values of parameters i e μ h 0 μ h b and μ k s listed in table 1 to study rainfall infiltration into the infinite slope with the impermeable boundary located at the slope base the vertical profiles of pore water pressure h and the corresponding factor of safety f s i at some selected times due to a given h b 0 1 m are displayed in fig 2 a and b respectively as shown in fig 2a the wetting front propagates as rainfall infiltration continues until it reaches the slope base the matric suction of the soil behind the wetting front gradually reduces over time and the soil becomes fully saturated and soil water pressure becomes positive and increases afterward the effect of infiltration on slope stability is illustrated in fig 2b which shows that the advance of the wetting front decreases the factor of safety at each potential slip surface at 1 day the factor of safety of this slope decreases below 1 i e unstable slope the above analysis based on the mean values of parameters provides a reference to illustrate the effects of variability of h 0 h b and k s in a heterogeneous slope first realizations of random fields of h 0 h b and k s fig 2c and d are generated using the karhunen loève k l expansion method e g ghanem and spanos 1991 jiang et al 2015 lu and zhang 2007 with the given spatial statistics listed in table 1 h 0 and h b are assumed to be normally distributed while k s is assumed to be log normally distributed e g brejda et al 2000 fenton and griffiths 2008 griffiths et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 li et al 2014 parkin et al 1988 parkin and robinson 1992 phoon and kulhawy 1999 note that various types of models e g the multiplicative random cascade models gupta and waymire 1993 menabde and sivapalan 2000 have been proposed in the literature for modeling rainfall time series however in this study we treat h b time series as a stochastic temporal process to illustrate the effect of variability in h b the generated realization see fig 2d is sufficient to capture observed features of measured rainfall data reported in stern and coe 1984 and menabde and sivapalan 2000 such as intermittency and correlation in addition considering the fact that the distributions of h 0 k s and h b are generally unknown in the study h 0 is randomly generated and assumed to be uncorrelated with k s and h b at previous time periods i e rainfall history if these factors are known correlation between these parameters could reduce the uncertainty of h 0 for this reason this assumption is deemed realistic subsequently the flow fields are simulated stability analyses are conducted and the results are displayed in fig 2e and f according to the figures the simulated h and f s i profiles dramatically differ from those based on mean values of parameters fig 2a and b which represent the most likely h and f s i profiles at different times for example the shape of h and f s i profiles in fig 2e and f are erratic at 0 01 day due to the variability of h 0 as the infiltration continues their deviations from the most likely profiles at the corresponding times become larger such large differences thus may pose a threat to the stability of the slope e g in fig 2f the f s i s around elevation 1 3 m are smaller than 1 for this reason a slope stability analysis should consider uncertainties in the variability of antecedent moisture content in the temporal variability of rainfalls and in the spatial variability of soil properties e g k s 3 probabilistic slope stability analysis in order to address the uncertainty issue as presented above a first order moment approach cai et al 2017d 2016 is developed and described below 3 1 first order estimation of slope stability uncertainty the initial pressure head h 0 which is directly related to soil moisture content varies spatially and its distribution is unknown we can treat it as a spatial random field this means the initial pressure head h 0 z i at each location in the slope is a random variable which has a mean value and a variance the collection of these random variables i e h 0 z i i 1 n forms the random field and is characterized by a joint probability distribution see yeh et al 2015 therefore h 0 z i is expressed in terms of the mean and perturbations 8a h 0 z i μ h 0 p h 0 z i i 1 n where μ h 0 is the mean of h 0 and p h 0 z i denotes the perturbation of h 0 at the location z i the pressure head h b at the land surface which is related to rainfall changes with time t and its distribution is also unknown thus h b at each time t l is considered as a random variable denoted as h b t l which has a mean value and a variance representing the uncertainty due to the temporal variability as well as lack of measurements consequently h b can be expressed as 8b h b t l μ h b t l p h b t l l 1 m where μ h b t l is the time varying mean of h b p h b t l denotes the perturbation of h b at the time t l and m denotes the total number of discrete time in addition the medium property k s of the slope is also considered as a spatial random field which can be expressed in the form of the mean and perturbations 8c k s z i μ k s p k s z i i 1 n where μ k s is the mean of k s and p k s z i denotes the perturbation of k s at location z i likewise the uncertainty in the f s i is represented by f s i μ f s i p f s i where μ f s i is the mean and p f s i is the perturbation expanding the f s i in eq 5 in a taylor series about the mean values of parameters neglecting second order and higher order terms and subtracting the mean part from both sides the f s i at ith potential slip surface at a given time t can be approximately expressed in a matrix form as 9 p fs t j fs h 0 t p h 0 j fs h b t p h b j fs k s t p k s where p fs p h 0 and p k s are n 1 vectors p h b is a m 1 vector j fs h 0 and j fs k s is a n n jacobian matrix representing the change in f s i i 1 n at ith potential slip surface at the time t due to a unit change in h 0 and k s respectively at the location z j j 1 n in the domain j fs h b is a n m jacobian matrix each term in the matrix denotes the sensitivity of f s z i t i 1 n to the change of h b at the time t l l 1 m due to the nonlinearity these sensitivities of the f s i with respect to h 0 h b or k s need to be evaluated numerically in this study the perturbation approach is employed we refer to cai et al 2017d for derivations of this sensitivity analysis approach in this study we assume that the spatially varying initial pressure head h 0 the time varying boundary condition h b and the medium property k s are mutually independent of each other therefore multiplying eq 9 by itself on both sides and taking the expected value of the product lead to the corresponding f s i auto covariance matrix r fsfs 10 r fsfs t j fs h 0 t r h 0 h 0 j fs h 0 t t j fs h b t r h b h b j fs h b t t j fs k s t r k s k s j fs k s t t where the superscript t denotes the transpose r h 0 h 0 and r k s k s are n n auto covariance matrices for h 0 and k s respectively r h b h b is an m m auto covariance matrix for h b r h 0 h 0 and r k s k s are modeled using an exponential function e g cai et al 2016 with the spatial correlation scale λ s λ h 0 λ k s in the z direction spatial correlation scale represents the distance within which the parameters i e h 0 z i or k s z i are correlated in space r h b h b is modeled using the exponential function with a temporal correlation scale λ t λ h b this temporal correlation scale represents the time interval within which the h b at different times are correlated in time the diagonal components of r fsfs are the f s i variances i 1 n at the time t which are denoted as σ fs 2 z i t i 1 n the σ fs 2 z i t represents the uncertainty in f s i at ith potential slip surface at the time t due to variabilities in h 0 at z j j 1 n h b at t l l 1 m and k s at z j j 1 n 3 2 reliability of slope stability evaluation in the probabilistic slope stability analysis we use the reliability index e g christian et al 1994 li et al 2014 to represent the reliability of slope stability evaluation the reliability index is defined as 11 β i t μ f s i t 1 σ f s i t where μ f s i and σ f s i are the mean and standard deviation of f s i at the ith potential slip surface at the time t respectively the reliability index describes the reliability of stability evaluations at certain parts at the time t in the slope it is defined as the ratio of the deviation of the mean fs from the limit equilibrium state value of 1 0 at a location i to the fs standard deviation at the location according to eq 11 if the β i at the ith surface is greater than 1 the standard deviation of the f s i is small compared with the deviation between the mean f s i and the critical equilibrium value 1 therefore the reliability of the slope is large in other words the uncertainty in slope stability due to variabilities in h 0 h b and k s is negligible and the μ f s i value thus is adequate to represent the slope stability on the contrary if the β i is smaller than 1 at the time t the distance between μ f s i and 1 is smaller than σ f s i hence the uncertainty in slope stability at the time t is significant this uncertainty is very likely to threaten the reliability of slope stability evaluations and deserves special attention the μ f s i i 1 n at each time step is evaluated using mean values of parameters and the σ f s i i 1 n at each time step is estimated using the first order moment approach abovementioned afterward β i i 1 n at each time step during rainfall is calculated by eq 11 3 3 probabilistic analysis for the base set here a case with μ h 0 2 m μ h b 0 1 m μ k s 0 2592 m d cov h 0 cov h b cov k s 1 0 λ h 0 0 3 m λ h b 0 3 day and λ k s 0 3 m is considered as the base case other parameters are listed in table 1 and the rainfall duration is 1 day the spatial distributions of σ f s i and β i at every potential slip surface of the slope under the variability of all parameters h 0 h b and k s at four different times 0 01 0 25 0 5 1 day are depicted in fig 3 a and b the contribution to σ f s i from the variability of each parameter is presented in a normalized form in fig 3c e as illustrated in fig 3a c e it is evident that the propagations of slope stability uncertainty due to impacts of variabilities in h 0 h b and k s are driven by the mean flow field see fig 2a and b since the mean value of rainfall intensity is larger than the value of initial pore water pressure and gravity rainfall infiltrates into the slope and the uncertainties propagate downwards at an early stage of infiltration e g t 0 25 day the values of σ f s i s at shallow depths are larger than those at deep parts further the variations of h 0 and k s contribute to σ f s i more than the variation of h b does moreover the variations of h 0 is the major uncertainty sources to σ f s i s at deep parts of the slope the variations of h b and k s only contribute to σ f s i at shallow depths at the late stage of infiltration e g t 1 day the values of σ f s i at shallow depths decline and become smaller than those at deep parts meanwhile the contribution of the variation of h 0 to σ f s i s diminishes while the contributions from the variations of h b and k s increase and become larger than that of h 0 these results manifest the influence of the variability in initial hydraulic condition at early times but its influence gradually attenuates as time progresses on the other hand the impact of the variability of rainfall continues to grow as the rainfall continues notice that although the contribution to σ f s i from variation of k s is generally largest among these three uncertainty sources the impacts on σ f s i from variations of h 0 and h b are comparable with those from the variation of k s and cannot be ignored this finding illuminates the importance of characterization of the variability in initial hydraulic conditions and rainfalls in slope stability evaluation notice that a localized large uncertainty zone i e the one along the solid purple line with gradient symbols at elevation 1 2 m in fig 3a moves from shallow parts to deep parts of the slope and accumulates above the impermeable bedrock this large uncertainty zone greatly impacts the reliability of slope stability evaluations and deserves special attention fig 3b indicates the rainfall infiltration decreases the β i of each potential slip surface for example the minimum value of β i s is smaller than 1 at 0 25 day around elevation 1 2 m at shallow parts of the slope and it decreases as infiltration continues overall localized low reliability zones form and move downwards during the rainfall infiltration process 4 influences of mean values of h 0 and h b 4 1 effects of initial pore water pressure to investigate the effects of mean initial pore water pressure on slope reliability three cases with μ h 0 equals 1 2 and 3 m respectively are considered the cov h 0 s of the three cases are set to the same 1 0 and the cov h b cov k s λ h 0 λ h b and λ k s of these cases are 1 0 1 0 0 3 m 0 3 day and 0 3 m respectively μ h b is set as 0 1 m μ k s is 0 2592 m d and the rainfall duration is 1 day as shown in fig 4 a where the μ f s i profiles at t 0 25 day for the three cases are plotted when the negative value of mean initial pore water pressure μ h 0 approaches zero the mean values of f s i s of every potential slip surface decrease significantly and become closer to the limit equilibrium state i e 1 the σ f s i profiles at t 0 25 day for the three cases due to variations of all parameters h 0 h b and k s are displayed in fig 4b the relative contribution from each parameter to σ f s i is shown in fig a1 figs 4b and a1 indicate that μ h 0 significantly influences the distributions of slope stability uncertainty induced by variabilities in initial hydraulic conditions rainfalls and soil hydraulic properties that is as μ h 0 increases less negative the localized large uncertainty zone propagates rapidly to the deep parts of the slope under the same rainfall intensity owing to the high hydraulic conductivity resulting from high μ h 0 in addition the maximum value of the uncertainty in the zone becomes smaller as μ h 0 increases this result is consistent with the finding that the variance in pressure head generally decreases as soils become close to saturation as explained by the moisture dependent variability theory reported by yeh et al 1985a b c the reliability index β i profiles at t 0 25 day for the three cases are shown in fig 4c apparently under the fixed rainfall intensity and time the less saturation the slope is the greater uncertainties of stabilities are near the shallow parts of slopes and the minimum value of the localized reliability zone becomes smaller all these factors lead to the high probability of failure at shallow parts of the less saturated slopes on the other hand albeit the influence of variations in initial hydraulic conditions rainfalls and soil hydraulic properties becomes smaller as the slope is close to saturation the mean values of f s i s become small and the propagation of the impact of variations is speeded up for these reasons the likelihood of failure of the potential slip surfaces at any elevation increases one typical realization of this situation is illustrated in fig 4d this realization is generated with abovementioned statistics except μ h 0 is set as 1 m 4 2 effects of rainfall intensity here the effects of the rainfall intensity on slope reliability are studied through three cases with μ h b equals 0 1 0 1 and 1 m respectively cov h 0 cov h b cov k s λ h 0 λ h b and λ k s of these cases are 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 3 m 0 3 days and 0 3 m respectively the mean initial pore water pressure μ h 0 is set to be 2 m μ k s is 0 2592 m d and the rainfall duration is 1 day the μ f s i profiles at t 0 25 day for the three cases are illustrated in fig 5 a as expected the increase of the mean rainfall intensity μ h b leads to decreases in μ f s i s toward 1 fig 5b shows the σ f s i profiles at t 0 25 day for the three cases due to variations of all parameters h 0 h b and k s while the relative contribution from each parameter to σ f s i is shown in fig a2 as illustrated in these figures μ h b has significant impacts on the distributions of slope stability uncertainty the increase in μ h b leads to increasing trends in the propagation depth of σ f s i s within the same time in addition given the same mean initial pore water pressure μ h 0 larger μ h b leads to a larger maximum value of the localized large uncertainty zone moreover when the mean rainfall intensity μ h b becomes smaller and closer to μ h 0 the localized large uncertainty zone gradually vanishes these findings indicate that a small rainfall intensity given limited times may fail to bring uncertainties into the slope under such circumstance the σ f s i s in the slope are mainly due to the variation of h 0 fig 5c depicts the reliability index β i profiles at t 0 25 day for the three cases as illustrated in fig 5c given the same μ h 0 the localized low reliability zone gradually forms and the minimum value of the localized low reliability zone becomes smaller as μ h b increases this indicates that small rainfall intensities with short duration pose no threat to slope stability on the other hand under heavy rainfall conditions the localized large uncertainty zone first takes place at shallow parts of slopes it impacts the reliability of slope stability evaluation and should be carefully treated one typical realization of this situation is depicted in fig 5d this realization is generated with abovementioned statistics except μ h b is set as 0 1 m 4 3 effects of rainfall duration in this section we investigate the effects of rainfall duration on slope reliability four cases are examined which include two types of rainfall namely short duration intense rainfall sdir and long duration mild rainfall ldmr on the slope under two initial hydraulic conditions the sdir is defined as the rainfall with a rainfall duration t rainfall 0 2 day and μ h b 0 1 m while the ldmr is rainfall with t rainfall 2 days and μ h b 1 m two mean initial pore water pressure μ h 0 values i e 2 m and 3 m respectively are considered cov h 0 cov h b cov k s λ h 0 λ h b and λ k s of these cases are 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 3 m 0 3 days and 0 3 m respectively μ k s is 0 2592 m d and the rainfall duration is 1 day the resultant reliability index β i profiles for the four cases at t 0 2 day t 1 day and t 2 days are displayed in fig 6 a c respectively the time periods t 0 2 day and t 2 days represent the time when the rain stops for sdir and ldmr respectively at 0 2 day the rain stops in the case of sdir while the rain continues in the case of ldmr the resultant reliability profiles are plotted in fig 6a the solid green lines with delta triangles and solid black lines with circles are for the ldmr cases with initial mean pressure heads of 2m and 3m respectively the reliabilities of the slope under ldmr are large in spite of the initial mean pressure heads sdir leads to localized low reliability zone at shallow depths of the slope as illustrated by the solid red lines with rectangles and solid blue lines with gradient triangles in the figure formation of this zone is expected since an intense rainfall leads to a decrease of the mean values of f s i s and large variations in slope stability σ f s i within short times see fig 5 at t 1 day in fig 6b and t 2 days in fig 6c the reliabilities still maintain relatively high at shallow depths under ldmr and the reliabilities at shallow parts of the slope under sdir rises due to the cease of rainfall and it becomes larger than those under ldmr in addition both sdir and ldmr lead to a localized low reliability zone at deep parts of the slope due to greater saturation as a result attention should be given to the uncertainties accumulated above the impermeable bedrock where become critical to the slope stability evaluation even if it is long after the heavy rainfall stops or under a mild rainfall we show one typical realization of this situation in fig 6d which is generated with abovementioned statistics under ldmr 4 4 effects of rainfall pattern as reported by previous studies e g ng et al 2001 zhang et al 2014 the rainfall pattern can significantly influence the slope stability even when the rainfall amount is the same for this reason we examine the effects of rainfall pattern on slope reliability specifically the stability uncertainty and reliability along the slope profile are calculated for three rainfall patterns namely ascending rainfall with μ h b increasing from 0 2 to 0 m uniform rainfall with μ h b equals 0 1 m and descending rainfall with μ h b decreasing from 0 to 0 2 m the cov h b s of these three cases are set to the same 1 0 note that in the case of ascending rainfall and the case of descending rainfall μ h b varies with times hence the cov h b s of these two cases are defined as the ratio of σ h b to the value of μ h b in the mid time of the rainfall duration i e 1 day in addition cov h 0 cov k s λ h 0 λ h b and λ k s of these cases are 1 0 1 0 0 3 m 0 3 days and 0 3 m respectively μ h 0 is 2 m and μ k s is 0 2592 m d the μ f s i profiles at t 0 25 day under the three rainfall patterns are plotted in fig 7 a they indicate that the μ f s i profile corresponding to the descending rainfall is the closest to 1 at the upper part of the slope the σ f s i profiles at t 0 25 day under the three rainfall patterns are presented in fig 7b the relative contribution from each parameter to σ f s i is shown in fig a3 as indicated by these figures the rainfall pattern can significantly affect the distribution of the slope stability uncertainty both the propagation depth of σ f s i s and the maximum value of the localized large uncertainty zone corresponding to the descending rainfall are the largest among the three rainfall patterns at a given time the reliability index β i profiles in fig 7c demonstrate that the descending rainfall pattern destabilizes slopes the most with the minimum value of the localized low reliability zone one typical realization generated with abovementioned statistics under the descending rainfall pattern is illustrated in fig 7d these results are likely owing to the fact that the descending rainfall with large rainfall intensities at early time enhances infiltration and leads great uncertainties 5 conclusions this study demonstrates that the uncertainties due to variabilities in initial soil pore water pressure distributions and rainfalls are as significant as that due to the variabilities in soil hydraulic properties which have been emphasized by many previous studies as a consequence our study stresses the fact that to better evaluate the slope stability the temporal and spatial propagation of slope stability uncertainty due to variabilities in initial soil pore water pressure distributions and rainfalls should also be considered in addition this study demonstrates that the propagation of slope stability uncertainty is driven by the propagation of the mean flow field during the rainfall infiltration process a localized large uncertainty zone along the slope stability profile could form and lead to the existence of a localized low reliability zone further it demonstrates that the build up of the localized large uncertainty zone or the localized low reliability zone is greatly influenced by the prior knowledge of the mean of initial pore water pressure the rainfall intensity the rainfall duration and the rainfall pattern the situations in which the uncertainties of slope stability are likely to impact the reliability of slope stability evaluations along with the critical time and location are presented in table 2 this indicates the location where the low reliability zone forms and the time when this zone starts to impact the slope under different situations under such situations the uncertainty plays a critical role in slope stability evaluation and requires special attention that is further investigation or monitoring measures should be implemented to the location of the low reliability zone to reduce the uncertainty e g cai et al 2017c as a result any unfavorable condition can be detected immediately before it is too late for prevention note that the above analysis is based on one dimensional infinite slope model such that the flow is restricted to vertical flow for this reason infiltrated water cannot detour from low k s zones and the pressure behind the zones must build up significantly to push water flow through in other words this one dimensional flow may have amplified effects of hydraulic heterogeneity multi dimensional flow models may reduce this magnification at last the climate of a region dictates typical ranges of the soil moistures and rainfall intensity and rainfall duration during a specific season compiling historical records of spatial distribution of soil moistures and temporal variation of rainfalls at the region can yield the general statistical description of initial hydraulic conditions and rainfalls this information could facilitate better evaluation of slope stability during any possible rainfall events declaration of

6646,a first order moment analysis is developed to investigate the temporal and spatial propagation of uncertainty of slope stability during rainfall considering spatial variabilities in initial soil water pressure and soil hydraulic properties and temporal variability of rainfall results of the analysis indicate that the uncertainties resulting from variabilities in initial soil pore water pressure distributions and rainfalls are comparable with that from the variability in soil hydraulic properties further the evolution of slope stability uncertainty is driven by the mean flow field and a localized large uncertainty zone along the slope profile could form leading to a localized low reliability zone which may lead to the failure of the slope in particular when the slope is close to saturation the reliability of the stability analysis of any elevation of the slope is low even at early rainfall times on the other hand when the slope is unsaturated and heavy rainfalls occur the low reliability zone exists at shallow parts of the slope at early times the results also show that greater unreliability exists at shallow depths at early times when the rainfall has a descending trend in comparison with uniform and increasing trend lastly the low reliability zone is always near the impermeable bedrock if rainfall persists keywords slope stability uncertainty variability initial soil pore water pressure rainfall characteristics large uncertainty zone low reliability zone 1 introduction rainfall induced landslides are one of the most severe natural disasters ng and shi 1998 ng et al 2001 significant landslide disasters triggered by rainfalls have been reported annually in many parts of the world such as brazil italy south africa japan and china chowdhury and flentje 2002 infiltration of precipitation increases soil moisture content decreases matric suction of unsaturated soils or creates positive pore water pressure and in turn decreases the shear strength of soils and consequently leads to landslides preventions for geohazards such as slope failures and landslides therefore require reliable evaluations of slope stability under rainfall infiltrations rainfall induced landslides are attributed to geologic characteristics topography initial soil pore water pressure and precipitation of the slope area due to the heterogeneous nature of the geology and our inability to characterize them an increasing number of researches has focused on the variabilities of soil properties and their effects on the slope stability e g ali et al 2014 cai et al 2017a c d cho 2014 griffiths et al 2011 gui et al 2000 on the other hand precipitation and initial soil pore water pressure generally exhibit a high degree of temporal and spatial variabilities for instance it has been widely recognized that rainfall intensity is significantly higher on the escarpment relative to the coastal plain chowdhury and flentje 2002 in addition rainfall processes are known to vary widely in time that is spatiotemporal variability is an intrinsic characteristic of climate paolini et al 2005 furthermore the distribution of initial soil pore water pressures in the slope also varies spatially due to variabilities in prior rainfalls and heterogeneities of geology previous studies have focused on the variabilities in rainfalls or initial soil pore water pressure distributions for example d odorico 2005 showed that the temporal variations of rainfall intensity affect stability and the rainfall pattern with a peak at the end of the rainfall process has a stronger destabilizing effect than a constant rainfall minder et al 2009 studied the impact of spatial rainfall heterogeneity on landslide susceptibility based on a numerical model and pointed out that the heterogeneous rainfall decreased slope stability von ruette et al 2014 investigated the effects of rainfall variabilities and initial soil hydraulic conditions on the statistics of locations the numbers and the released volumes of landslides at a catchment they suggested that fewer landslides were triggered under dry initial soil conditions than the wet conditions and rainfall heterogeneity may be an important missing link required for landslide prediction since it is practically impossible to characterize the variabilities in initial soil pore water pressure and rainfalls in detail uncertainties in the evaluation of slope stability exist for this reason these variabilities deserve particular attention the understanding of these variabilities and their effects on slope stability is still relatively limited at present for instance in most studies rainfall data is obtained via spatially and temporally averaging approaches or interpolation using sparse rain gauge measurements or coarse rainfall radar information over large areas von ruette et al 2014 the initial soil pore water pressure is frequently assumed to be spatially invariant e g cho 2014 or to be those obtained by steady state simulations under antecedent rainfalls e g cai et al 2017b in these approaches the initial soil pore water pressure and rainfall are considered as deterministic and their uncertainties are ignored these simplifications lead to inaccurate predictions of landslides which hamper mitigation procedures during this rainfall infiltration process in a slope the effect of spatial variability in initial soil pore water pressure and soil properties and temporal varying rainfall on the slope stability evolves with time and space as a result it becomes important to know where and when the potential slip surfaces have relatively large uncertainties of their stabilities and whether these uncertainties are significant enough to impact the slope stability these issues are seldom investigated therefore we are compelled to conduct a probabilistic analysis of the interaction between temporal and spatial distributions of initial soil pore water pressures rainfalls soil properties and slope stability the primary objective of this study is to propose a stochastic approach for a better understanding and prediction of the temporal and spatial evolution of slope stability uncertainty caused by variabilities in initial soil pore water pressure distributions rainfalls and soil hydraulic properties and its importance in slope stability evaluations during rainfall this paper is organized as follows the basic equations for describing the one dimensional vertical seepage and evaluation of infinite slope stability and deterministic analysis of slope stability are presented in section 2 section 3 first presents the first order moment approach and the approach to quantitatively represent the spatial variability in initial hydraulic conditions and soil hydraulic properties and the temporal variability of rainfalls during the rainfall process then it describes a probabilistic analysis of slope stability simulation results for different scenarios are discussed in section 4 with respect to the effects of the initial soil pore water pressure rainfall intensity rainfall duration and rainfall pattern on uncertainty propagations of slope stability and the importance of these uncertainties on slope stability the article then draws conclusions in section 5 2 deterministic slope stability analysis under rainfall 2 1 governing equations for seepage analysis the rainfall infiltration process in the infinite slope fig 1 is assumed to be described by a one dimensional governing vertical flow equation yeh et al 2015 1 z k h h z 1 η s s c h h t where z denotes the coordinate along the vertical z axis positive upward h is the pressure head k h is the hydraulic conductivity s s is the specific storage c h denotes the moisture capacity term t denotes time η is the saturation index h is a positive value if the medium is fully saturated and is negative if the medium is unsaturated k h varies with pressure head under unsaturated conditions s s represents the percentage of water released from a unit volume of fully saturated porous media under a unit decline in hydraulic head on the other hand c h θ h h is the change in moisture content in a unit volume of the porous medium under a unit change of negative pressure head when the medium is unsaturated while s s and c h are similar in definition the physical mechanisms they represented are entirely different s s is related to the compressibility of porous media and water while the medium remains fully saturated whereas c h represents desaturation or saturation of the pores in the medium on the right hand side of eq 1 η is set to 1 if the medium is saturated and 0 if the medium is unsaturated eq 1 is subjected to an initial condition 2a h z 0 h 0 z where h 0 z is the prescribed

factor of safety along ith potential slip surface i e f s i of an infinite slope has been widely evaluated using the limit equilibrium model lem with the unified effective stress under both saturated and unsaturated conditions lu and godt 2008 if we let the pore air pressure u a be atmospheric pressure i e u a 0 f s i can be expressed as e g ali et al 2014 cho 2014 griffiths et al 2011 li et al

are the effective cohesion and the effective soil friction angle at ith potential slip surface and z i is the elevation positive upward of ith potential slip surface see fig 1 σ i s represents the effective negative pore water pressure under unsaturated conditions or effective positive pore water pressure when under saturated conditions at ith potential slip surface lu and godt 2008 according to lu and godt 2008 σ i s can be expressed as 6 σ i s θ i θ r θ s θ r u a u wi s ei u a u wi where u wi s ei and θ i are the pore water pressure the effective water saturation and the volumetric moisture content at ith potential slip surface respectively the relationship between u w and h is u w h γ w σ i s s ei u wi 0 is for unsaturated conditions u wi 0 and σ i s u wi 0 is for saturated conditions u wi 0 via this unified effective stress theory eq 5 can account for both the reduction in matric suction and the development of positive pore water pressure in a continuous form cho 2014 lu and godt 2008 in this study the variation in unit weight resulting from changes in moisture content during infiltration is evaluated by integration of the moisture content profile above the

water 2 3 setup of model catastrophic shallow landslides frequently occur under heavy rainfall in weathered granite residual soil slopes in korea and the southeast coast of china the method developed here therefore is applied to the weathered granite residual soil slopes as an example generally the hillslope in these areas can be treated as an unsaturated shallow layered slope above an impermeable bedrock and the one dimensional infinite slope model is appropriate for the simulation e g ali et al 2014 cai et al 2017a c d cho 2014 griffiths et al 2011 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 the geometrical parameters and all the hydraulic and mechanical parameters for this investigation are listed in table 1 they are adopted from the data listed in cho 2014 which are representative of typical weathered granite soils in seochang korea the entire infinite slope is discretized into 40 elements in the vertical direction representing 40 potential slip surfaces i e n 40 with an interval δ z of 0 05 m these potential slip surfaces are numbered 1 to 40 from the slope base to the land surface see fig 1 in addition the initial pressure head distribution in the slope is described by h0 which is a function of z and an impermeable boundary is located at the slope base as rainfall occurs a specific pressure head h b which is a function of t is assigned to the top boundary to represent a variable rainfall a finite element analysis code available at http tian hwr arizona edu downloads yeh et al 1993 is employed to simulate the one dimensional vertical seepage described by eq 1 subjected to the initial and boundary conditions described by eq 2 subsequently computed vertical profiles of pore water pressure effective water saturation and moisture content from transient finite element seepage analyses are used as inputs for calculating f s i i 1 n at each time step by eq 5 2 4 deterministic analysis first a deterministic transient seepage analysis is conducted by using the mean values of parameters i e μ h 0 μ h b and μ k s listed in table 1 to study rainfall infiltration into the infinite slope with the impermeable boundary located at the slope base the vertical profiles of pore water pressure h and the corresponding factor of safety f s i at some selected times due to a given h b 0 1 m are displayed in fig 2 a and b respectively as shown in fig 2a the wetting front propagates as rainfall infiltration continues until it reaches the slope base the matric suction of the soil behind the wetting front gradually reduces over time and the soil becomes fully saturated and soil water pressure becomes positive and increases afterward the effect of infiltration on slope stability is illustrated in fig 2b which shows that the advance of the wetting front decreases the factor of safety at each potential slip surface at 1 day the factor of safety of this slope decreases below 1 i e unstable slope the above analysis based on the mean values of parameters provides a reference to illustrate the effects of variability of h 0 h b and k s in a heterogeneous slope first realizations of random fields of h 0 h b and k s fig 2c and d are generated using the karhunen loève k l expansion method e g ghanem and spanos 1991 jiang et al 2015 lu and zhang 2007 with the given spatial statistics listed in table 1 h 0 and h b are assumed to be normally distributed while k s is assumed to be log normally distributed e g brejda et al 2000 fenton and griffiths 2008 griffiths et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 li et al 2014 parkin et al 1988 parkin and robinson 1992 phoon and kulhawy 1999 note that various types of models e g the multiplicative random cascade models gupta and waymire 1993 menabde and sivapalan 2000 have been proposed in the literature for modeling rainfall time series however in this study we treat h b time series as a stochastic temporal process to illustrate the effect of variability in h b the generated realization see fig 2d is sufficient to capture observed features of measured rainfall data reported in stern and coe 1984 and menabde and sivapalan 2000 such as intermittency and correlation in addition considering the fact that the distributions of h 0 k s and h b are generally unknown in the study h 0 is randomly generated and assumed to be uncorrelated with k s and h b at previous time periods i e rainfall history if these factors are known correlation between these parameters could reduce the uncertainty of h 0 for this reason this assumption is deemed realistic subsequently the flow fields are simulated stability analyses are conducted and the results are displayed in fig 2e and f according to the figures the simulated h and f s i profiles dramatically differ from those based on mean values of parameters fig 2a and b which represent the most likely h and f s i profiles at different times for example the shape of h and f s i profiles in fig 2e and f are erratic at 0 01 day due to the variability of h 0 as the infiltration continues their deviations from the most likely profiles at the corresponding times become larger such large differences thus may pose a threat to the stability of the slope e g in fig 2f the f s i s around elevation 1 3 m are smaller than 1 for this reason a slope stability analysis should consider uncertainties in the variability of antecedent moisture content in the temporal variability of rainfalls and in the spatial variability of soil properties e g k s 3 probabilistic slope stability analysis in order to address the uncertainty issue as presented above a first order moment approach cai et al 2017d 2016 is developed and described below 3 1 first order estimation of slope stability uncertainty the initial pressure head h 0 which is directly related to soil moisture content varies spatially and its distribution is unknown we can treat it as a spatial random field this means the initial pressure head h 0 z i at each location in the slope is a random variable which has a mean value and a variance the collection of these random variables i e h 0 z i i 1 n forms the random field and is characterized by a joint probability distribution see yeh et al 2015 therefore h 0 z i is expressed in terms of the mean and perturbations 8a h 0 z i μ h 0 p h 0 z i i 1 n where μ h 0 is the mean of h 0 and p h 0 z i denotes the perturbation of h 0 at the location z i the pressure head h b at the land surface which is related to rainfall changes with time t and its distribution is also unknown thus h b at each time t l is considered as a random variable denoted as h b t l which has a mean value and a variance representing the uncertainty due to the temporal variability as well as lack of measurements consequently h b can be expressed as 8b h b t l μ h b t l p h b t l l 1 m where μ h b t l is the time varying mean of h b p h b t l denotes the perturbation of h b at the time t l and m denotes the total number of discrete time in addition the medium property k s of the slope is also considered as a spatial random field which can be expressed in the form of the mean and perturbations 8c k s z i μ k s p k s z i i 1 n where μ k s is the mean of k s and p k s z i denotes the perturbation of k s at location z i likewise the uncertainty in the f s i is represented by f s i μ f s i p f s i where μ f s i is the mean and p f s i is the perturbation expanding the f s i in eq 5 in a taylor series about the mean values of parameters neglecting second order and higher order terms and subtracting the mean part from both sides the f s i at ith potential slip surface at a given time t can be approximately expressed in a matrix form as 9 p fs t j fs h 0 t p h 0 j fs h b t p h b j fs k s t p k s where p fs p h 0 and p k s are n 1 vectors p h b is a m 1 vector j fs h 0 and j fs k s is a n n jacobian matrix representing the change in f s i i 1 n at ith potential slip surface at the time t due to a unit change in h 0 and k s respectively at the location z j j 1 n in the domain j fs h b is a n m jacobian matrix each term in the matrix denotes the sensitivity of f s z i t i 1 n to the change of h b at the time t l l 1 m due to the nonlinearity these sensitivities of the f s i with respect to h 0 h b or k s need to be evaluated numerically in this study the perturbation approach is employed we refer to cai et al 2017d for derivations of this sensitivity analysis approach in this study we assume that the spatially varying initial pressure head h 0 the time varying boundary condition h b and the medium property k s are mutually independent of each other therefore multiplying eq 9 by itself on both sides and taking the expected value of the product lead to the corresponding f s i auto covariance matrix r fsfs 10 r fsfs t j fs h 0 t r h 0 h 0 j fs h 0 t t j fs h b t r h b h b j fs h b t t j fs k s t r k s k s j fs k s t t where the superscript t denotes the transpose r h 0 h 0 and r k s k s are n n auto covariance matrices for h 0 and k s respectively r h b h b is an m m auto covariance matrix for h b r h 0 h 0 and r k s k s are modeled using an exponential function e g cai et al 2016 with the spatial correlation scale λ s λ h 0 λ k s in the z direction spatial correlation scale represents the distance within which the parameters i e h 0 z i or k s z i are correlated in space r h b h b is modeled using the exponential function with a temporal correlation scale λ t λ h b this temporal correlation scale represents the time interval within which the h b at different times are correlated in time the diagonal components of r fsfs are the f s i variances i 1 n at the time t which are denoted as σ fs 2 z i t i 1 n the σ fs 2 z i t represents the uncertainty in f s i at ith potential slip surface at the time t due to variabilities in h 0 at z j j 1 n h b at t l l 1 m and k s at z j j 1 n 3 2 reliability of slope stability evaluation in the probabilistic slope stability analysis we use the reliability index e g christian et al 1994 li et al 2014 to represent the reliability of slope stability evaluation the reliability index is defined as 11 β i t μ f s i t 1 σ f s i t where μ f s i and σ f s i are the mean and standard deviation of f s i at the ith potential slip surface at the time t respectively the reliability index describes the reliability of stability evaluations at certain parts at the time t in the slope it is defined as the ratio of the deviation of the mean fs from the limit equilibrium state value of 1 0 at a location i to the fs standard deviation at the location according to eq 11 if the β i at the ith surface is greater than 1 the standard deviation of the f s i is small compared with the deviation between the mean f s i and the critical equilibrium value 1 therefore the reliability of the slope is large in other words the uncertainty in slope stability due to variabilities in h 0 h b and k s is negligible and the μ f s i value thus is adequate to represent the slope stability on the contrary if the β i is smaller than 1 at the time t the distance between μ f s i and 1 is smaller than σ f s i hence the uncertainty in slope stability at the time t is significant this uncertainty is very likely to threaten the reliability of slope stability evaluations and deserves special attention the μ f s i i 1 n at each time step is evaluated using mean values of parameters and the σ f s i i 1 n at each time step is estimated using the first order moment approach abovementioned afterward β i i 1 n at each time step during rainfall is calculated by eq 11 3 3 probabilistic analysis for the base set here a case with μ h 0 2 m μ h b 0 1 m μ k s 0 2592 m d cov h 0 cov h b cov k s 1 0 λ h 0 0 3 m λ h b 0 3 day and λ k s 0 3 m is considered as the base case other parameters are listed in table 1 and the rainfall duration is 1 day the spatial distributions of σ f s i and β i at every potential slip surface of the slope under the variability of all parameters h 0 h b and k s at four different times 0 01 0 25 0 5 1 day are depicted in fig 3 a and b the contribution to σ f s i from the variability of each parameter is presented in a normalized form in fig 3c e as illustrated in fig 3a c e it is evident that the propagations of slope stability uncertainty due to impacts of variabilities in h 0 h b and k s are driven by the mean flow field see fig 2a and b since the mean value of rainfall intensity is larger than the value of initial pore water pressure and gravity rainfall infiltrates into the slope and the uncertainties propagate downwards at an early stage of infiltration e g t 0 25 day the values of σ f s i s at shallow depths are larger than those at deep parts further the variations of h 0 and k s contribute to σ f s i more than the variation of h b does moreover the variations of h 0 is the major uncertainty sources to σ f s i s at deep parts of the slope the variations of h b and k s only contribute to σ f s i at shallow depths at the late stage of infiltration e g t 1 day the values of σ f s i at shallow depths decline and become smaller than those at deep parts meanwhile the contribution of the variation of h 0 to σ f s i s diminishes while the contributions from the variations of h b and k s increase and become larger than that of h 0 these results manifest the influence of the variability in initial hydraulic condition at early times but its influence gradually attenuates as time progresses on the other hand the impact of the variability of rainfall continues to grow as the rainfall continues notice that although the contribution to σ f s i from variation of k s is generally largest among these three uncertainty sources the impacts on σ f s i from variations of h 0 and h b are comparable with those from the variation of k s and cannot be ignored this finding illuminates the importance of characterization of the variability in initial hydraulic conditions and rainfalls in slope stability evaluation notice that a localized large uncertainty zone i e the one along the solid purple line with gradient symbols at elevation 1 2 m in fig 3a moves from shallow parts to deep parts of the slope and accumulates above the impermeable bedrock this large uncertainty zone greatly impacts the reliability of slope stability evaluations and deserves special attention fig 3b indicates the rainfall infiltration decreases the β i of each potential slip surface for example the minimum value of β i s is smaller than 1 at 0 25 day around elevation 1 2 m at shallow parts of the slope and it decreases as infiltration continues overall localized low reliability zones form and move downwards during the rainfall infiltration process 4 influences of mean values of h 0 and h b 4 1 effects of initial pore water pressure to investigate the effects of mean initial pore water pressure on slope reliability three cases with μ h 0 equals 1 2 and 3 m respectively are considered the cov h 0 s of the three cases are set to the same 1 0 and the cov h b cov k s λ h 0 λ h b and λ k s of these cases are 1 0 1 0 0 3 m 0 3 day and 0 3 m respectively μ h b is set as 0 1 m μ k s is 0 2592 m d and the rainfall duration is 1 day as shown in fig 4 a where the μ f s i profiles at t 0 25 day for the three cases are plotted when the negative value of mean initial pore water pressure μ h 0 approaches zero the mean values of f s i s of every potential slip surface decrease significantly and become closer to the limit equilibrium state i e 1 the σ f s i profiles at t 0 25 day for the three cases due to variations of all parameters h 0 h b and k s are displayed in fig 4b the relative contribution from each parameter to σ f s i is shown in fig a1 figs 4b and a1 indicate that μ h 0 significantly influences the distributions of slope stability uncertainty induced by variabilities in initial hydraulic conditions rainfalls and soil hydraulic properties that is as μ h 0 increases less negative the localized large uncertainty zone propagates rapidly to the deep parts of the slope under the same rainfall intensity owing to the high hydraulic conductivity resulting from high μ h 0 in addition the maximum value of the uncertainty in the zone becomes smaller as μ h 0 increases this result is consistent with the finding that the variance in pressure head generally decreases as soils become close to saturation as explained by the moisture dependent variability theory reported by yeh et al 1985a b c the reliability index β i profiles at t 0 25 day for the three cases are shown in fig 4c apparently under the fixed rainfall intensity and time the less saturation the slope is the greater uncertainties of stabilities are near the shallow parts of slopes and the minimum value of the localized reliability zone becomes smaller all these factors lead to the high probability of failure at shallow parts of the less saturated slopes on the other hand albeit the influence of variations in initial hydraulic conditions rainfalls and soil hydraulic properties becomes smaller as the slope is close to saturation the mean values of f s i s become small and the propagation of the impact of variations is speeded up for these reasons the likelihood of failure of the potential slip surfaces at any elevation increases one typical realization of this situation is illustrated in fig 4d this realization is generated with abovementioned statistics except μ h 0 is set as 1 m 4 2 effects of rainfall intensity here the effects of the rainfall intensity on slope reliability are studied through three cases with μ h b equals 0 1 0 1 and 1 m respectively cov h 0 cov h b cov k s λ h 0 λ h b and λ k s of these cases are 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 3 m 0 3 days and 0 3 m respectively the mean initial pore water pressure μ h 0 is set to be 2 m μ k s is 0 2592 m d and the rainfall duration is 1 day the μ f s i profiles at t 0 25 day for the three cases are illustrated in fig 5 a as expected the increase of the mean rainfall intensity μ h b leads to decreases in μ f s i s toward 1 fig 5b shows the σ f s i profiles at t 0 25 day for the three cases due to variations of all parameters h 0 h b and k s while the relative contribution from each parameter to σ f s i is shown in fig a2 as illustrated in these figures μ h b has significant impacts on the distributions of slope stability uncertainty the increase in μ h b leads to increasing trends in the propagation depth of σ f s i s within the same time in addition given the same mean initial pore water pressure μ h 0 larger μ h b leads to a larger maximum value of the localized large uncertainty zone moreover when the mean rainfall intensity μ h b becomes smaller and closer to μ h 0 the localized large uncertainty zone gradually vanishes these findings indicate that a small rainfall intensity given limited times may fail to bring uncertainties into the slope under such circumstance the σ f s i s in the slope are mainly due to the variation of h 0 fig 5c depicts the reliability index β i profiles at t 0 25 day for the three cases as illustrated in fig 5c given the same μ h 0 the localized low reliability zone gradually forms and the minimum value of the localized low reliability zone becomes smaller as μ h b increases this indicates that small rainfall intensities with short duration pose no threat to slope stability on the other hand under heavy rainfall conditions the localized large uncertainty zone first takes place at shallow parts of slopes it impacts the reliability of slope stability evaluation and should be carefully treated one typical realization of this situation is depicted in fig 5d this realization is generated with abovementioned statistics except μ h b is set as 0 1 m 4 3 effects of rainfall duration in this section we investigate the effects of rainfall duration on slope reliability four cases are examined which include two types of rainfall namely short duration intense rainfall sdir and long duration mild rainfall ldmr on the slope under two initial hydraulic conditions the sdir is defined as the rainfall with a rainfall duration t rainfall 0 2 day and μ h b 0 1 m while the ldmr is rainfall with t rainfall 2 days and μ h b 1 m two mean initial pore water pressure μ h 0 values i e 2 m and 3 m respectively are considered cov h 0 cov h b cov k s λ h 0 λ h b and λ k s of these cases are 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 3 m 0 3 days and 0 3 m respectively μ k s is 0 2592 m d and the rainfall duration is 1 day the resultant reliability index β i profiles for the four cases at t 0 2 day t 1 day and t 2 days are displayed in fig 6 a c respectively the time periods t 0 2 day and t 2 days represent the time when the rain stops for sdir and ldmr respectively at 0 2 day the rain stops in the case of sdir while the rain continues in the case of ldmr the resultant reliability profiles are plotted in fig 6a the solid green lines with delta triangles and solid black lines with circles are for the ldmr cases with initial mean pressure heads of 2m and 3m respectively the reliabilities of the slope under ldmr are large in spite of the initial mean pressure heads sdir leads to localized low reliability zone at shallow depths of the slope as illustrated by the solid red lines with rectangles and solid blue lines with gradient triangles in the figure formation of this zone is expected since an intense rainfall leads to a decrease of the mean values of f s i s and large variations in slope stability σ f s i within short times see fig 5 at t 1 day in fig 6b and t 2 days in fig 6c the reliabilities still maintain relatively high at shallow depths under ldmr and the reliabilities at shallow parts of the slope under sdir rises due to the cease of rainfall and it becomes larger than those under ldmr in addition both sdir and ldmr lead to a localized low reliability zone at deep parts of the slope due to greater saturation as a result attention should be given to the uncertainties accumulated above the impermeable bedrock where become critical to the slope stability evaluation even if it is long after the heavy rainfall stops or under a mild rainfall we show one typical realization of this situation in fig 6d which is generated with abovementioned statistics under ldmr 4 4 effects of rainfall pattern as reported by previous studies e g ng et al 2001 zhang et al 2014 the rainfall pattern can significantly influence the slope stability even when the rainfall amount is the same for this reason we examine the effects of rainfall pattern on slope reliability specifically the stability uncertainty and reliability along the slope profile are calculated for three rainfall patterns namely ascending rainfall with μ h b increasing from 0 2 to 0 m uniform rainfall with μ h b equals 0 1 m and descending rainfall with μ h b decreasing from 0 to 0 2 m the cov h b s of these three cases are set to the same 1 0 note that in the case of ascending rainfall and the case of descending rainfall μ h b varies with times hence the cov h b s of these two cases are defined as the ratio of σ h b to the value of μ h b in the mid time of the rainfall duration i e 1 day in addition cov h 0 cov k s λ h 0 λ h b and λ k s of these cases are 1 0 1 0 0 3 m 0 3 days and 0 3 m respectively μ h 0 is 2 m and μ k s is 0 2592 m d the μ f s i profiles at t 0 25 day under the three rainfall patterns are plotted in fig 7 a they indicate that the μ f s i profile corresponding to the descending rainfall is the closest to 1 at the upper part of the slope the σ f s i profiles at t 0 25 day under the three rainfall patterns are presented in fig 7b the relative contribution from each parameter to σ f s i is shown in fig a3 as indicated by these figures the rainfall pattern can significantly affect the distribution of the slope stability uncertainty both the propagation depth of σ f s i s and the maximum value of the localized large uncertainty zone corresponding to the descending rainfall are the largest among the three rainfall patterns at a given time the reliability index β i profiles in fig 7c demonstrate that the descending rainfall pattern destabilizes slopes the most with the minimum value of the localized low reliability zone one typical realization generated with abovementioned statistics under the descending rainfall pattern is illustrated in fig 7d these results are likely owing to the fact that the descending rainfall with large rainfall intensities at early time enhances infiltration and leads great uncertainties 5 conclusions this study demonstrates that the uncertainties due to variabilities in initial soil pore water pressure distributions and rainfalls are as significant as that due to the variabilities in soil hydraulic properties which have been emphasized by many previous studies as a consequence our study stresses the fact that to better evaluate the slope stability the temporal and spatial propagation of slope stability uncertainty due to variabilities in initial soil pore water pressure distributions and rainfalls should also be considered in addition this study demonstrates that the propagation of slope stability uncertainty is driven by the propagation of the mean flow field during the rainfall infiltration process a localized large uncertainty zone along the slope stability profile could form and lead to the existence of a localized low reliability zone further it demonstrates that the build up of the localized large uncertainty zone or the localized low reliability zone is greatly influenced by the prior knowledge of the mean of initial pore water pressure the rainfall intensity the rainfall duration and the rainfall pattern the situations in which the uncertainties of slope stability are likely to impact the reliability of slope stability evaluations along with the critical time and location are presented in table 2 this indicates the location where the low reliability zone forms and the time when this zone starts to impact the slope under different situations under such situations the uncertainty plays a critical role in slope stability evaluation and requires special attention that is further investigation or monitoring measures should be implemented to the location of the low reliability zone to reduce the uncertainty e g cai et al 2017c as a result any unfavorable condition can be detected immediately before it is too late for prevention note that the above analysis is based on one dimensional infinite slope model such that the flow is restricted to vertical flow for this reason infiltrated water cannot detour from low k s zones and the pressure behind the zones must build up significantly to push water flow through in other words this one dimensional flow may have amplified effects of hydraulic heterogeneity multi dimensional flow models may reduce this magnification at last the climate of a region dictates typical ranges of the soil moistures and rainfall intensity and rainfall duration during a specific season compiling historical records of spatial distribution of soil moistures and temporal variation of rainfalls at the region can yield the general statistical description of initial hydraulic conditions and rainfalls this information could facilitate better evaluation of slope stability during any possible rainfall events declaration of

6647,proper soil hydraulic functions of the water retention curve the wrc and relative hydraulic conductivity the rhc are essential for studies of unsaturated groundwater flow in soils various mathematical expressions of these functions have been proposed including the widely used van genuchten mualem model combining the van genuchten formula for the wrc and the mualem formula for the rhc here we validate a model based on the van genuchten function for the both wrc and rhc termed the mvg model against published experimental data covering a wide range of soil textures from sand to silt clay loam the results show that the mvg model is more accurate and flexible than existing soil hydraulic functions especially for predicting the rhc the fitting of the model to the data also reveals a relationship of model parameters between the mvg wrc and mvg rhc functions both functions can be integrated and differentiated to attain simple analytical expressions for characteristic parameters of soil water flow for example the wetting front pressure ψ f used in the green and ampt model for ponded infiltration analysis and the characteristic length l c as a key factor in determining various flow processes e g drainage or evaporation in unsaturated soils keywords water retention curve relative hydraulic conductivity vg model wetting front pressure characteristic length 1 introduction unsaturated flow in soils influences significantly a variety of hydrological systems and processes in particular groundwater recharge surface runoff evaporation and solute transport brutsaert 1982 nielsen et al 1986 li et al 1997 xin et al 2010 beven 2011 kong et al 2013 2015 luo et al 2018 quantification of this flow is facilitated by mathematical expressions of the soil hydraulic functions for the soil water retention curve the wrc which describes the relationship between the soil volumetric water content θ and its corresponding capillary head ψ and the hydraulic conductivity k as a function of ψ or θ under equilibrium conditions generally k is scaled by the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of the porous medium i e k kskr θ or k kskr ψ where kr is the relative hydraulic conductivity the rhc over the past decades various mathematical expressions have been proposed to describe the wrc and rhc gardner 1958 brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 assouline 2005 assouline and selker 2017 these expressions are often required to be continuous and or simple enough to facilitate the derivation of analytical and numerical solutions for the unsaturated flow equation the methods for developing the wrc can be mainly divided into four classes i finding empirical functions that match the measured data well brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 ii developing expressions based on the similarity in shape between the wrc and the particle size distribution assouline et al 1998 kosugi 1994 1996 iii fractal representation and conceptualization of the soil random structure chan and govindaraju 2003 tyler and wheatcraft 1989 and iv pore scale imaging and pore scale modeling raoof et al 2013 among the various wrcs the models of brooks and corey 1964 and van genuchten 1980 have been most widely implemented in variably saturated flow models such as hydrus simunek et al 2005 sutra voss and provost 2008 and fellow diersch 2014 brooks and corey 1964 related the pore size distribution to soil water retention and proposed a power law relationship between ψ and effective saturation s e ψ referred to as the bc wrc model hereinafter the bc wrc model is in a simple functional form which however is discontinuous in its first order derivative at the point where the capillary head equals to the air entry pressure to overcome this problem van genuchten 1980 suggested another attractive empirical wrc model with two fitting parameters referred to as the vg wrc model hereinafter despite no direct consideration of the air entry pressure the vg wrc model can mimic the effect through an inflection point and performs overall better than the bc wrc model van genuchten and nielsen 1985 however the integral of the vg wrc function is difficult to obtain which may inhibit the derivation of analytical solutions for the unsaturated flow equation troch 1993 hilberts et al 2005 both the bc wrc and vg wrc models are empirical assouline et al 1998 proposed a physically based expression of the wrc referred to as the as wrc model hereinafter by linking the soil particle or aggregate size distribution to a fragmentation process tested on various soils from sand to clay the as wrc model was found to be flexible enough to represent a wide range of wrc shapes note that the as wrc function is also continuously differentiable over the entire capillary head range for more details regarding the development of wrc the readers may refer to the comprehensive reviews of assouline and or 2013 and heinen and bakker 2016 in parallel to the work on the wrc great efforts have been paid to developing appropriate mathematical expressions for the rhc another important soil hydraulic property assouline and tartakovsky 2001 burdine 1953 mualem 1976a methods for deriving the rhc expression can also be categorized into four types assouline 2001 assouline and selker 2017 including empirical statistical macroscopic approaches and pore scale imaging and pore scale modeling the first two approaches dominate with the first one aiming to best fit simple mathematical formulas to available hydraulic conductivity data and the second one linking the rhc expression to the wrc model gardner 1958 suggested an exponential function with one fitting parameter to describe the rhc referred to as the g rhc model hereinafter brooks and corey 1964 proposed a power function with two fitting parameters as the rhc expression referred as the bc rhc model hereinafter although both the g rhc and bc rhc models are widely used for deriving analytical solutions of unsaturated flow equation due to their simplicity these models lack an inflection point required to accurately fit measured data mualem 1976a proposed a pore size distribution model for the rhc in the form of a simple integral referred to as the m rhc model hereinafter since experimental determination of the rhc is time consuming the greatest advantage of the m rhc model is that the rhc can be reduced to a closed form in cases where the wrc is given by an analytical expression following the above method van genuchten 1980 obtained a closed form expression for the rhc referred to as the vg rhc model hereinafter by substituting the vg wrc model into the m rhc model more recently assouline and selker 2017 introduced a weibull hydraulic conductivity pressure head relationship for unsaturated soils referred to as the as rhc model hereinafter unlike the g rhc and bc rhc model the m rhc vg rhc and as rhc models possess inflection points which help to fit the experimental data better to derive accurate analytical solutions of the unsaturated flow equation the expressions of wrc and rhc models are required to not only have an inflection point to fit the experimental data better but also facilitate easy integration and differentiation for analytical derivations all of the above wrc and rhc models cannot satisfy these two requirements at the same time except for the as rhc model however the integral of the as rhc model retains the gamma function which would be inconvenient for developing an analytical solution of the flow equation in view of the above problems by changing the exponent of the vg wrc expression troch 1993 proposed a modified model referred to as the mvg wrc model hereinafter capable of describing the wrc for a variety of soils hilberts et al 2005 used the mvg wrc model to derive a hillslope storage boussinesq hsb equation for studying groundwater flow in hillslope aquifers recently kong et al 2016 suggested a mathematical expression of the rhc similar to the mvg wrc function referred to as the mvg rhc model hereinafter both the mvg wrc and mvg rhc functions can be easily integrated and differentiated to facilitate the derivation of analytical solutions for the unsaturated flow equation however no rigorous evaluation of the mvg wrc and mvg rhc functions has been carried out it remains unclear whether both functions can fit the experimental data well for a wide range of soils in this study we aim to validate a model referred to as the mvg model hereinafter composing of the mvg wrc and mvg rhc functions against a published dataset in comparison with other existing soil hydraulic functions i e as wrc and as rhc and vg wrc and vg rhc in addition since there are four free parameters in the mvg model two each in mvg wrc and mvg rhc we examine possible relationship between the free fitting parameters of the mvg wrc function and those of the mvg rhc function furthermore we derive simple analytical expressions for characteristic parameters of soil water flow based on the mvg model this paper is arranged as follows in section 2 we give a concise introduction to the as model the vg model and the mvg model note that each model involves two functions for wrc and rhc as discussed above in section 3 we validate the mvg model using a published dataset covering 27 soils and establish the relationship between the parameters of mvg wrc and mvg rhc functions section 4 provides the derivation of the new analytical solutions for the wetting front pressure and characteristic length based on the mvg model finally the conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 soil hydraulic properties 2 1 as model assuming a uniform and random fragmentation process assouline et al 1998 derived a physically based wrc function as wrc 1 s e ψ 1 exp ξ ψ 1 ψ l 1 μ 0 ψ ψ l where s e θ θ r θ s θ r is the effective saturation ranging from 0 to 1 with θ s and θ r being the saturated and residual volumetric water contents respectively ξ l and μ are free parameters obtained via fitting to experimental data and ψ l l is the capillary head corresponding to a very low volumetric water content and is taken to be 15 bar according to assouline 2005 and assouline et al 1998 assouline and selker 2017 proposed a weibull function for describing the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and capillary head i e as rhc 2 k r ψ e γ ψ ω where γ l 1 and ω are the fitting parameters it can be seen that when the fitting parameter ω equals to 1 eq 2 is reduced to gardner s rhc function according to the work of assouline and selker 2017 the integral of eq 2 leads to 3 k r ψ d ψ γ 1 ω γ 1 ω γ ψ ω ω where γ s x is the incomplete gamma function philip 1969 defined the integral in eq 3 as the relative matric flux potential rmfp the gradient of which determines the matric component of the flux according to darcy s law raats 1970 2 2 vg model the vg wrc function proposed by van genuchten 1980 can be written as 4 s e ψ 1 1 α vg ψ n m where α vg l 1 and n are the van genuchten parameters related to the soils and m is a constant defined by m 1 1 n using a statistical pore size distribution model mualem 1976a showed that the rhc can be formulated in the form 5 k r ψ s e 1 2 0 s e 1 ψ d s e 0 1 1 ψ d s e 2 substituting eq 4 into eq 5 leads to a closed form of the rhc namely the vg rhc function 6 k r ψ s e 1 2 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 note that since it is difficult to obtain the integrals of eqs 5 and 6 as required often in deriving analytical solutions for the unsaturated flow equation the vg model has been widely used in numerical solutions for unsaturated flow models simunek et al 2005 voss and provost 2008 diersch 2014 shen et al 2015 in addition the exponent of se is set to 1 2 in present paper although making an adjustable value of this exponent could be give better results as indicated by van genuchten and nielsen 1985 and schaap and leij 2000 however an investigation of this effect would be outside the scope of this study 2 3 mvg model troch 1993 modified the vg wrc function by setting m 1 1 n 1 n 1 n 7 s e ψ 1 1 α 1 ψ n 1 1 1 n 1 where α 1 l 1 and n 1 are the new modified vg parameters obtained via fitting to the experimental data the integral of the mvg wrc is given by 8 s e ψ d ψ ψ 1 α 1 ψ n 1 1 n 1 motivated by the simplicity of the mvg wrc function kong et al 2016 suggested a similar form for describing the rhc i e mvg rhc 9 k r ψ 1 1 α 2 ψ n 2 1 1 n 2 where α 2 l 1 and n 2 are the fitting parameters compared with the vg model including two parameters the as and mvg models require two additional parameters two parameters each in the wrc and rhc functions the integral of the mvg rhc function is simply 10 k r ψ d ψ ψ 1 α 2 ψ n 2 1 n 2 from a mathematical point of view eq 10 is more direct and concise than the eq 3 which would simplify the derivation of analytical solutions for the unsaturated flow equation 3 results and discussions 3 1 validating the mvg model against the experimental data the mvg model was validated using a published dataset covering 27 soils with known hydraulic functions the dataset covering a wide range of soil textures from sand to silt clay loam was compiled from studies by hanks and bowers 1962 brooks and corey 1964 jackson et al 1965 rawitz 1965 jensen and hanks 1967 mualem 1976b haverkamp et al 1977 and sakai and toride 2007 the mvg as and vg models were fitted to regular values of the wrc drying path and rhc data using a nonlinear regression algorithm namely matlab function lsqcurvefit the optimization functions for the wrc and rhc are defined respectively as 11 φ x i 1 j θ i θ i x 2 and 12 φ y i 1 p k i k i y 2 where j and p are the number of data pairs for the retention function and conductivity function θ i θ i k i and k i are the measured and predicted values respectively and x and y are the parameter vectors compared with the rhc data the wrc data are usually easier to measure thus the optimal parameter values of the vg model were directly determined by wrc data and x α vg n for the as model x ξ μ and y γ ω and for the mvg model x α 1 n 1 and y α 2 n 2 all three models used the same θ s and θ r values for each soil listed in the supporting information additionally we fixed the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and hence assumed kr 1 at saturation as noted by van genuchten and nielsen 1985 ks is a notoriously variable parameter and as such probably should be treated as just other data point the optimal fitting parameter values in terms of ξ μ α vg n α 1 and n 1 corresponding to the wrc functions and γ ω α 2 and n 2 corresponding to the rhc functions are listed in table 1 fig 1 shows the agreement between the experimental data and predictions given by the three different models for five soils presented in table 1 it can be seen that the wrc and rhc functions of these models are flexible enough to depict different curves for different soils for the wrc the predicted results of the as vg and mvg model are almost identical all three wrc functions allow an inflection point and reproduce the experimental data of wrc accurately for the rhc the predictions of all three models again show an inflection point similar to that shown by the wrc functions fig 1 overall the predictions of the mvg model are found to match more closely the experimental data for all five soils the predicted results of the as model differ slightly from those of the mvg model however the predictions of the vg model deviate considerably from the experimental data especially for the pachappa fine sandy clay mualem 1976b and yolo light clay haverkamp et al 1977 the remaining fitting results of the as vg and mvg models for the other 22 soils are shown in the fig s1 in the supporting information in addition we introduced the root mean square error rmse to quantify the goodness of fitting of the three models to the experimental data the smaller value of rmse indicates closer match of model predictions with the measurements fig 2 a and b presents the results of rmse for the wrc and rhc data respectively supporting information listed in table s1 for the wrc functions fig 2a the values of rmse for the three models are small within 0 085 for all 27 soils and the average values of rmse for the three models are nearly identical 0 032 0 033 and 0 035 for the as vg and mvg model respectively fig 2b shows the values of rmse for the three rhc functions it is clear that the values of rmse of the mvg model are the smallest among all the three models for each soil with the maximum and average value of rmse being 0 105 and 0 036 respectively the predicted results of the as model also matched the measured values well with the average value of rmse equal to 0 058 however the predicted values of the vg model deviated considerably from the experimental data especially for the silt mont cenis mualem 1976b and bet netofa clay rawitz 1965 for which the values of rmse are 0 654 and 0 587 respectively 3 2 relationships between parameters of the mvg model compared with the original vg model the mvg model has two additional free fitting parameters for the rhc function it would be interesting to explore the possible relationship between the wrc α 1 and n 1 and rhc α 2 and n 2 parameters based on the 27 soils with a broad range of α 1 values from 0 019 to 4 48 and n 1 values from 0 585 to 14 214 as listed in table 1 for this purpose we fitted two polynomial functions for α 2 and n 2 as dependent variables of both α 1 and n 1 with the fitting tool of matlab respectively based on parameter values listed in table 1 the obtained expressions are as follows 13 α 2 f α 1 n 1 4 948 50 78 α 1 9 875 n 1 85 22 α 1 2 13 62 α 1 n 1 3 783 n 1 2 63 94 α 1 3 21 91 α 1 2 n 1 0 1912 α 1 n 1 2 0 419 n 1 3 18

n 2 g α 1 n 1 12 55 0 1948 α 1 29 66 n 1 30 16 α 1 2 14 79 α 1 n 1 25 37 n 1 2 3 718 α 1 3 32 27 α 1 2 n 1 14 22 α 1 n 1 2 8 289 n 1 3 3 α 1 4 2 068 α 1 3 n 1 7 099 α 1 2 n 1 2 2 978 α 1 n 1 3 1 091 n

1 is very close as shown in fig 3 with r2 0 99 for α 2 and 0 97 for n 2 these strong relationships between model parameters suggest that the number of free parameters in the mvg model has not increased if we use the variables α 1 and n 1 to infer the value of α 2 and n 2 to further test the relationships as expressed by eqs 13 and 14 we calculated the rmse between the predicted values of the mvg rhc model with parameter values α 2 and n 2 calculated by eqs 13 and 14 and the experimental data for all 27 soils presented in table 1 the results are shown in fig 2b generally the values of rmse of the mvg rhc model with α 2 and n 2 predicted with eqs 13 and 14 are relatively low in all cases except for weld silty clay loam jensen and hanks 1967 hygiene sandstone brooks and corey 1964 and pachappa loam jackson et al 1965 compared with the as rhc and mvg rhc models with optimal fitting parameter values the rmse for the mvg rhc model with α 2 and n 2 predicted with eqs 13 and 14 is relatively higher however in 17 cases out of 27 considered the mvg rhc model with α 2 and n 2 predicted with eqs 13 and 14 performed better with the lower value of rmse than the traditional vg rhc model moreover the mean value of rmse for the mvg rhc model with α 2 and n 2 predicted with eqs 13 and 14 is 0 092 still significantly lower than that value for the vg rhc model 0 159 with optimal fitting parameters 4 applications 4 1 calculation of the critical pressure hc to characterize flow in the unsaturated zone bouwer 1966 defined a critical pressure h c l 15 h c 0 k r ψ d ψ eq 15 was found to be equivalent to the wetting front potential ψ f l in the infiltration model of green and ampt 1911 which is a useful physically based model for ponded infiltration and has been widely

that from a mathematical point of view the form of eq 18 is more direct and concise than eq 17 for the vg rhc function an approximation of h c or ψ f can be obtained morel seytoux et al 1996 19 h c ψ f 0 046 m 2 07 m 2 19 5 m 3 1 4 7 m 16 m 2 α vg we calculated the values of h c based on eqs 17 and 18 for 27 soils as presented in table 1 respectively as shown in fig 4 there is almost no difference between the values of h c calculated by both equations for coarse textured materials α 2 1 while for the fine textured soils α 2 1 the values of h c calculated by eq 17 are slightly small than those by eq 18 to further compare eq 17 19 we examined how the predictions of the green and ampt model eq 16 match experimental data given values of ψ f calculated by eqs 17 19 respectively reported data from a one dimensional ponded infiltration experiment were considered in which the cumulative infiltration q into the grenoble sand was measured parlange et al 1985 details on experimental setting and soil hydraulic properties are listed in table 2 when the eqs 17 19 are used to calculate ψ f for the grenoble sand the corresponding values are 0 129 m 0 1 m and 0 105 m respectively fig 5 compares the results predicted with eq 16 using these ψ f values with experimental data it can be seen that the green and ampt model with all three ψ f values matched well with the experimental data in general though the results based on the ψ f value given by eq 18 appear to be slightly better 4 2 calculation of the characteristic length lc a range of characteristic length scales have been developed for governing flow processes in the unsaturated zone associated with for example soil evaporation and drainage assouline and or 2014 lehmann et al 2008 a characteristic length l c given by the head difference between the air entry head ψ ae and critical capillary head ψ ch assouline et al 2017 or et al 2015 ψ ch ψ ae has been used to illustrate several unsaturated flow phenomena including the transition from capillary supplied stage i evaporation to vapor diffusion controlled stage ii evaporation lehmann et al 2008 the attainment of field capacity assouline and or 2014 and the zone of phase entrapment behind drainage fronts hoogland et al 2015 l c i e ψ ae and ψ ch can be obtained either from the wrc or rhc curve following the linearization procedure proposed by lehmann et al 2008 we derived analytical expressions of l c based on the mvg wrc and mvg rhc functions respectively with d 2 s e d ψ 2 0 the location of inflection point for the mvg wrc curve given by the linearized analysis is 20 ψ 1 α 1 n 1 1 n 1 2 1 n 1 n 1 1 substituting eq 18 into eq 7 the corresponding s e value can be obtained 21 s e 1 1 α 1 ψ n 1 1 1 n 1 an equation of the tangential line passing through the points ψ s e is s e s e b ψ ψ with the slope b given by 22 b d s e d ψ ψ ψ α n 1 n 1 1 ψ n 1 1 1 α ψ n 1 2 1 n 1 according to the definitions of ψ ae and ψ ch supporting information fig s2 analytical expressions for the air entry head critical capillary head and characteristic length are given as follows 23a ψ ae ψ 1 s e b ψ ch ψ s e b 23b l c ψ ch ψ ae 1 b since the functions of mvg wrc and mvg rhc are similar the analytical expression of l c based on the mvg rhc curve can be obtained by replacing α 1 and n 1 with α 2 and n 2 respectively for brevity the analytical expressions of characteristic length l c based on the vg wrc as wrc and as rhc functions are not presented here and readers can find those analytical expressions in assouline et al 2017 fig 6 compares the characteristic length l c i e ψ ae and ψ ch based on the as vg and mvg models for 22 soils fitting parameters n 1 n 2 and ω are larger than unity out of 27 presented in table 1 note that the 22 soils were renumbered for the following analysis supporting information table s2 in general the values of ψ ae ψ ch and l c estimated by different models are reasonable as they match well with each other the values of ψ ae are not significantly affected by the model chosen to describe the wrc fig 6a the values of ψ ch calculated from the as wrc and vg wrc functions are slightly lower than those based on the mvg wrc function which further leads to the lower values of characteristic length l c in particular for the fine textured soils bigger values of ψ ch fig 6b and c for results based on the rhc only as rhc and mvg rhc are compared since a simple analytical expression of characteristic length l c is not available for the vg model again the values of ψ ae calculated from the two models are almost identical fig 6d however fig 6e shows that the values of ψ ch estimated from as wrc are slightly higher than those based on mvg wrc therefore the values of l c estimated from the as rhc model are slightly higher than those of the mvg rhc model fig 6f moreover whether choosing the wrc or rhc function the values of ψ ae are not significantly affected the function selection becomes more relevant for estimating the values of ψ ch and l c both of which are smaller when estimated from the rhc function than those from the wrc function these results are the same as those of assouline et al 2017 and indicate that the value of l c for the design of evaporation column experiments should be better determined based on the wrc function for the values of ψ ch estimated from the wrc or rhc function we further calculated the corresponding value of the critical saturation degree s ch and the relative hydraulic conductivity k ch since determination of s ch has significant implications for designing the irrigation system and k ch is directly linked to the time required to attain the field capacity assouline and or 2014 fig 7 a and b shows the values of s ch and k ch estimated from the five alternative approaches respectively it can be clearly seen that both the values of s ch and k ch estimated from the rhc functions are higher than those estimated from the wrc functions which are consistent with the results of ψ ch fig 6b and e note that the values of s ch and k ch estimated from the mvg rhc function are the highest for most of soils moreover the results shown in fig 7b demonstrates that the time required to attain the field capacity is faster if the value of k ch is estimated from the rhc functions instead of the wrc functions assouline et al 2017 5 conclusions analytical expressions of the soil hydraulic properties are essential for accurate modeling hydrological processes in unsaturated porous media in this study the modified vg model the mvg model consisting of the water retention curve proposed by troch 1993 the mvg wrc function and the relative hydraulic conductivity rhc function proposed by kong et al 2016 the mvg rhc function were validated using a published dataset with 27 soils covering a wide range of soil textures from sand to silt clay loam results show that the mvg model is more accurate and flexible than the original vg model especially for predicting the relative hydraulic conductivity in addition the expressions of the mvg model can be easily integrated and differentiated to facilitate derivation of analytical solutions relationships between free fitting parameters of the water retention curve and relative hydraulic conductivity function of the mvg model were established based on the measured data the mvg model was further applied to derive analytical expressions for the wetting front pressure ψ f which is crucial in the green and ampt model for ponded infiltration and the characteristic length l c i e the air entry head ψ ae and critical capillary head ψ ch which characterize flow processes e g drainage or evaporation in unsaturated porous media the value of ψ f was found to be inversely proportional to the fitting parameter α 2 of the mvg rhc function moreover we calculated the values of ψ ae ψ ch and l c for 22 soils fitting parameters n 1 n 2 and ω is larger than unity results show that the values of ψ ae are not significantly affected by the model chosen to describe the wrc or rhc while the values of ψ ch estimated from wrc are higher than those calculated based on rhc consequently the values of l c estimated from the wrc are higher than those calculated from the rhc this indicates that the value of l c for the design of evaporation column experiments should be better determined from the wrc function furthermore the corresponding values of the critical saturation degree s ch and the relative hydraulic conductivity k ch for each of ψ ch were calculated the values of s ch and k ch estimated from the rhc functions are higher than those estimated from the wrc functions consistent with the results of ψ ch although the mvg model provides good predictions high quality data that cover a variety of soil textures are required to further test this model and the empirical relationships between parameters of the wrc and rhc competing interests the authors declare that there is no

6647,proper soil hydraulic functions of the water retention curve the wrc and relative hydraulic conductivity the rhc are essential for studies of unsaturated groundwater flow in soils various mathematical expressions of these functions have been proposed including the widely used van genuchten mualem model combining the van genuchten formula for the wrc and the mualem formula for the rhc here we validate a model based on the van genuchten function for the both wrc and rhc termed the mvg model against published experimental data covering a wide range of soil textures from sand to silt clay loam the results show that the mvg model is more accurate and flexible than existing soil hydraulic functions especially for predicting the rhc the fitting of the model to the data also reveals a relationship of model parameters between the mvg wrc and mvg rhc functions both functions can be integrated and differentiated to attain simple analytical expressions for characteristic parameters of soil water flow for example the wetting front pressure ψ f used in the green and ampt model for ponded infiltration analysis and the characteristic length l c as a key factor in determining various flow processes e g drainage or evaporation in unsaturated soils keywords water retention curve relative hydraulic conductivity vg model wetting front pressure characteristic length 1 introduction unsaturated flow in soils influences significantly a variety of hydrological systems and processes in particular groundwater recharge surface runoff evaporation and solute transport brutsaert 1982 nielsen et al 1986 li et al 1997 xin et al 2010 beven 2011 kong et al 2013 2015 luo et al 2018 quantification of this flow is facilitated by mathematical expressions of the soil hydraulic functions for the soil water retention curve the wrc which describes the relationship between the soil volumetric water content θ and its corresponding capillary head ψ and the hydraulic conductivity k as a function of ψ or θ under equilibrium conditions generally k is scaled by the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of the porous medium i e k kskr θ or k kskr ψ where kr is the relative hydraulic conductivity the rhc over the past decades various mathematical expressions have been proposed to describe the wrc and rhc gardner 1958 brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 assouline 2005 assouline and selker 2017 these expressions are often required to be continuous and or simple enough to facilitate the derivation of analytical and numerical solutions for the unsaturated flow equation the methods for developing the wrc can be mainly divided into four classes i finding empirical functions that match the measured data well brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 ii developing expressions based on the similarity in shape between the wrc and the particle size distribution assouline et al 1998 kosugi 1994 1996 iii fractal representation and conceptualization of the soil random structure chan and govindaraju 2003 tyler and wheatcraft 1989 and iv pore scale imaging and pore scale modeling raoof et al 2013 among the various wrcs the models of brooks and corey 1964 and van genuchten 1980 have been most widely implemented in variably saturated flow models such as hydrus simunek et al 2005 sutra voss and provost 2008 and fellow diersch 2014 brooks and corey 1964 related the pore size distribution to soil water retention and proposed a power law relationship between ψ and effective saturation s e ψ referred to as the bc wrc model hereinafter the bc wrc model is in a simple functional form which however is discontinuous in its first order derivative at the point where the capillary head equals to the air entry pressure to overcome this problem van genuchten 1980 suggested another attractive empirical wrc model with two fitting parameters referred to as the vg wrc model hereinafter despite no direct consideration of the air entry pressure the vg wrc model can mimic the effect through an inflection point and performs overall better than the bc wrc model van genuchten and nielsen 1985 however the integral of the vg wrc function is difficult to obtain which may inhibit the derivation of analytical solutions for the unsaturated flow equation troch 1993 hilberts et al 2005 both the bc wrc and vg wrc models are empirical assouline et al 1998 proposed a physically based expression of the wrc referred to as the as wrc model hereinafter by linking the soil particle or aggregate size distribution to a fragmentation process tested on various soils from sand to clay the as wrc model was found to be flexible enough to represent a wide range of wrc shapes note that the as wrc function is also continuously differentiable over the entire capillary head range for more details regarding the development of wrc the readers may refer to the comprehensive reviews of assouline and or 2013 and heinen and bakker 2016 in parallel to the work on the wrc great efforts have been paid to developing appropriate mathematical expressions for the rhc another important soil hydraulic property assouline and tartakovsky 2001 burdine 1953 mualem 1976a methods for deriving the rhc expression can also be categorized into four types assouline 2001 assouline and selker 2017 including empirical statistical macroscopic approaches and pore scale imaging and pore scale modeling the first two approaches dominate with the first one aiming to best fit simple mathematical formulas to available hydraulic conductivity data and the second one linking the rhc expression to the wrc model gardner 1958 suggested an exponential function with one fitting parameter to describe the rhc referred to as the g rhc model hereinafter brooks and corey 1964 proposed a power function with two fitting parameters as the rhc expression referred as the bc rhc model hereinafter although both the g rhc and bc rhc models are widely used for deriving analytical solutions of unsaturated flow equation due to their simplicity these models lack an inflection point required to accurately fit measured data mualem 1976a proposed a pore size distribution model for the rhc in the form of a simple integral referred to as the m rhc model hereinafter since experimental determination of the rhc is time consuming the greatest advantage of the m rhc model is that the rhc can be reduced to a closed form in cases where the wrc is given by an analytical expression following the above method van genuchten 1980 obtained a closed form expression for the rhc referred to as the vg rhc model hereinafter by substituting the vg wrc model into the m rhc model more recently assouline and selker 2017 introduced a weibull hydraulic conductivity pressure head relationship for unsaturated soils referred to as the as rhc model hereinafter unlike the g rhc and bc rhc model the m rhc vg rhc and as rhc models possess inflection points which help to fit the experimental data better to derive accurate analytical solutions of the unsaturated flow equation the expressions of wrc and rhc models are required to not only have an inflection point to fit the experimental data better but also facilitate easy integration and differentiation for analytical derivations all of the above wrc and rhc models cannot satisfy these two requirements at the same time except for the as rhc model however the integral of the as rhc model retains the gamma function which would be inconvenient for developing an analytical solution of the flow equation in view of the above problems by changing the exponent of the vg wrc expression troch 1993 proposed a modified model referred to as the mvg wrc model hereinafter capable of describing the wrc for a variety of soils hilberts et al 2005 used the mvg wrc model to derive a hillslope storage boussinesq hsb equation for studying groundwater flow in hillslope aquifers recently kong et al 2016 suggested a mathematical expression of the rhc similar to the mvg wrc function referred to as the mvg rhc model hereinafter both the mvg wrc and mvg rhc functions can be easily integrated and differentiated to facilitate the derivation of analytical solutions for the unsaturated flow equation however no rigorous evaluation of the mvg wrc and mvg rhc functions has been carried out it remains unclear whether both functions can fit the experimental data well for a wide range of soils in this study we aim to validate a model referred to as the mvg model hereinafter composing of the mvg wrc and mvg rhc functions against a published dataset in comparison with other existing soil hydraulic functions i e as wrc and as rhc and vg wrc and vg rhc in addition since there are four free parameters in the mvg model two each in mvg wrc and mvg rhc we examine possible relationship between the free fitting parameters of the mvg wrc function and those of the mvg rhc function furthermore we derive simple analytical expressions for characteristic parameters of soil water flow based on the mvg model this paper is arranged as follows in section 2 we give a concise introduction to the as model the vg model and the mvg model note that each model involves two functions for wrc and rhc as discussed above in section 3 we validate the mvg model using a published dataset covering 27 soils and establish the relationship between the parameters of mvg wrc and mvg rhc functions section 4 provides the derivation of the new analytical solutions for the wetting front pressure and characteristic length based on the mvg model finally the conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 soil hydraulic properties 2 1 as model assuming a uniform and random fragmentation process assouline et al 1998 derived a physically based wrc function as wrc 1 s e ψ 1 exp ξ ψ 1 ψ l 1 μ 0 ψ ψ l where s e θ θ r θ s θ r is the effective saturation ranging from 0 to 1 with θ s and θ r being the saturated and residual volumetric water contents respectively ξ l and μ are free parameters obtained via fitting to experimental data and ψ l l is the capillary head corresponding to a very low volumetric water content and is taken to be 15 bar according to assouline 2005 and assouline et al 1998 assouline and selker 2017 proposed a weibull function for describing the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and capillary head i e as rhc 2 k r ψ e γ ψ ω where γ l 1 and ω are the fitting parameters it can be seen that when the fitting parameter ω equals to 1 eq 2 is reduced to gardner s rhc function according to the work of assouline and selker 2017 the integral of eq 2 leads to 3 k r ψ d ψ γ 1 ω γ 1 ω γ ψ ω ω where γ s x is the incomplete gamma function philip 1969 defined the integral in eq 3 as the relative matric flux potential rmfp the gradient of which determines the matric component of the flux according to darcy s law raats 1970 2 2 vg model the vg wrc function proposed by van genuchten 1980 can be written as 4 s e ψ 1 1 α vg ψ n m where α vg l 1 and n are the van genuchten parameters related to the soils and m is a constant defined by m 1 1 n using a statistical pore size distribution model mualem 1976a showed that the rhc can be formulated in the form 5 k r ψ s e 1 2 0 s e 1 ψ d s e 0 1 1 ψ d s e 2 substituting eq 4 into eq 5 leads to a closed form of the rhc namely the vg rhc function 6 k r ψ s e 1 2 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 note that since it is difficult to obtain the integrals of eqs 5 and 6 as required often in deriving analytical solutions for the unsaturated flow equation the vg model has been widely used in numerical solutions for unsaturated flow models simunek et al 2005 voss and provost 2008 diersch 2014 shen et al 2015 in addition the exponent of se is set to 1 2 in present paper although making an adjustable value of this exponent could be give better results as indicated by van genuchten and nielsen 1985 and schaap and leij 2000 however an investigation of this effect would be outside the scope of this study 2 3 mvg model troch 1993 modified the vg wrc function by setting m 1 1 n 1 n 1 n 7 s e ψ 1 1 α 1 ψ n 1 1 1 n 1 where α 1 l 1 and n 1 are the new modified vg parameters obtained via fitting to the experimental data the integral of the mvg wrc is given by 8 s e ψ d ψ ψ 1 α 1 ψ n 1 1 n 1 motivated by the simplicity of the mvg wrc function kong et al 2016 suggested a similar form for describing the rhc i e mvg rhc 9 k r ψ 1 1 α 2 ψ n 2 1 1 n 2 where α 2 l 1 and n 2 are the fitting parameters compared with the vg model including two parameters the as and mvg models require two additional parameters two parameters each in the wrc and rhc functions the integral of the mvg rhc function is simply 10 k r ψ d ψ ψ 1 α 2 ψ n 2 1 n 2 from a mathematical point of view eq 10 is more direct and concise than the eq 3 which would simplify the derivation of analytical solutions for the unsaturated flow equation 3 results and discussions 3 1 validating the mvg model against the experimental data the mvg model was validated using a published dataset covering 27 soils with known hydraulic functions the dataset covering a wide range of soil textures from sand to silt clay loam was compiled from studies by hanks and bowers 1962 brooks and corey 1964 jackson et al 1965 rawitz 1965 jensen and hanks 1967 mualem 1976b haverkamp et al 1977 and sakai and toride 2007 the mvg as and vg models were fitted to regular values of the wrc drying path and rhc data using a nonlinear regression algorithm namely matlab function lsqcurvefit the optimization functions for the wrc and rhc are defined respectively as 11 φ x i 1 j θ i θ i x 2 and 12 φ y i 1 p k i k i y 2 where j and p are the number of data pairs for the retention function and conductivity function θ i θ i k i and k i are the measured and predicted values respectively and x and y are the parameter vectors compared with the rhc data the wrc data are usually easier to measure thus the optimal parameter values of the vg model were directly determined by wrc data and x α vg n for the as model x ξ μ and y γ ω and for the mvg model x α 1 n 1 and y α 2 n 2 all three models used the same θ s and θ r values for each soil listed in the supporting information additionally we fixed the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and hence assumed kr 1 at saturation as noted by van genuchten and nielsen 1985 ks is a notoriously variable parameter and as such probably should be treated as just other data point the optimal fitting parameter values in terms of ξ μ α vg n α 1 and n 1 corresponding to the wrc functions and γ ω α 2 and n 2 corresponding to the rhc functions are listed in table 1 fig 1 shows the agreement between the experimental data and predictions given by the three different models for five soils presented in table 1 it can be seen that the wrc and rhc functions of these models are flexible enough to depict different curves for different soils for the wrc the predicted results of the as vg and mvg model are almost identical all three wrc functions allow an inflection point and reproduce the experimental data of wrc accurately for the rhc the predictions of all three models again show an inflection point similar to that shown by the wrc functions fig 1 overall the predictions of the mvg model are found to match more closely the experimental data for all five soils the predicted results of the as model differ slightly from those of the mvg model however the predictions of the vg model deviate considerably from the experimental data especially for the pachappa fine sandy clay mualem 1976b and yolo light clay haverkamp et al 1977 the remaining fitting results of the as vg and mvg models for the other 22 soils are shown in the fig s1 in the supporting information in addition we introduced the root mean square error rmse to quantify the goodness of fitting of the three models to the experimental data the smaller value of rmse indicates closer match of model predictions with the measurements fig 2 a and b presents the results of rmse for the wrc and rhc data respectively supporting information listed in table s1 for the wrc functions fig 2a the values of rmse for the three models are small within 0 085 for all 27 soils and the average values of rmse for the three models are nearly identical 0 032 0 033 and 0 035 for the as vg and mvg model respectively fig 2b shows the values of rmse for the three rhc functions it is clear that the values of rmse of the mvg model are the smallest among all the three models for each soil with the maximum and average value of rmse being 0 105 and 0 036 respectively the predicted results of the as model also matched the measured values well with the average value of rmse equal to 0 058 however the predicted values of the vg model deviated considerably from the experimental data especially for the silt mont cenis mualem 1976b and bet netofa clay rawitz 1965 for which the values of rmse are 0 654 and 0 587 respectively 3 2 relationships between parameters of the mvg model compared with the original vg model the mvg model has two additional free fitting parameters for the rhc function it would be interesting to explore the possible relationship between the wrc α 1 and n 1 and rhc α 2 and n 2 parameters based on the 27 soils with a broad range of α 1 values from 0 019 to 4 48 and n 1 values from 0 585 to 14 214 as listed in table 1 for this purpose we fitted two polynomial functions for α 2 and n 2 as dependent variables of both α 1 and n 1 with the fitting tool of matlab respectively based on parameter values listed in table 1 the obtained expressions are as follows 13 α 2 f α 1 n 1 4 948 50 78 α 1 9 875 n 1 85 22 α 1 2 13 62 α 1 n 1 3 783 n 1 2 63 94 α 1 3 21 91 α 1 2 n 1 0 1912 α 1 n 1 2 0 419 n 1 3 18

n 2 g α 1 n 1 12 55 0 1948 α 1 29 66 n 1 30 16 α 1 2 14 79 α 1 n 1 25 37 n 1 2 3 718 α 1 3 32 27 α 1 2 n 1 14 22 α 1 n 1 2 8 289 n 1 3 3 α 1 4 2 068 α 1 3 n 1 7 099 α 1 2 n 1 2 2 978 α 1 n 1 3 1 091 n 1 4 1 753 α 1 5 2 455 α 1 4 n 1 1 391 α 1 3 n 1 2 0 1134 α 1 2 n 1 3 0 1671 α 1 1 n 1 4 0 0495 n 1 5 the fitting of both functions to the values of α 2 and n 2 determined based on the mvg model table 1 is very close as shown in fig 3 with r2 0 99 for α 2 and 0 97 for n 2 these strong relationships between model parameters suggest that the number of free parameters in the mvg model has not increased if we use the variables α 1 and n 1 to infer the value of α 2 and n 2 to further test the relationships as expressed by eqs 13 and 14 we calculated the rmse between the predicted values of the mvg rhc model with parameter values α 2 and n 2 calculated by eqs 13 and 14 and the experimental data for all 27 soils presented in table 1 the results are shown in fig 2b generally the values of rmse of the mvg rhc model with α 2 and n 2 predicted with eqs 13 and 14 are relatively low in all cases except for weld silty clay loam jensen and hanks 1967 hygiene sandstone brooks and corey 1964 and pachappa loam jackson et al 1965 compared with the as rhc and mvg rhc models with optimal fitting parameter values the rmse for the mvg rhc model with α 2 and n 2 predicted with eqs 13 and 14 is relatively higher however in 17 cases out of 27 considered the mvg rhc model with α 2 and n 2 predicted with eqs 13 and 14 performed better with the lower value of rmse than the traditional vg rhc model moreover the mean value of rmse for the mvg rhc model with α 2 and n 2 predicted with eqs 13 and 14 is 0 092 still significantly lower than that value for the vg rhc model 0 159 with optimal fitting parameters 4 applications 4 1 calculation of the critical pressure hc to characterize flow in the unsaturated zone bouwer 1966 defined a critical pressure h c l 15 h c 0 k r ψ d ψ eq 15 was found to be equivalent to the wetting front potential ψ f l in the infiltration model of green and ampt 1911 which is a useful physically based model for ponded infiltration and has been widely adopted due to its parsimony and accuracy assouline and selker 2017 selker and assouline 2017 the green and ampt model can be written as follows 16 t θ s θ i k s l ψ f d ln ψ f d l ψ f d where l l is the depth of the wetting front below the soil surface at time t t d l is the depth of ponding and θ i is the initial water content in the soil profile the cumulative infiltration q l into the soil profile can be calculated as q θ s θ i l based on eq 3 rmfp of the as rhc function the corresponding definition of h c or ψ f is written as follows assouline and selker 2017 17 h c ψ f 0 k r ψ d ψ γ 1 ω ω γ 1 ω where γ s is the complete gamma function the corresponding expression following eq 10 rmfp of the mvg rhc function is given simply as 18 h c ψ f 0 k r ψ d ψ ψ 1 α 2 ψ n 2 1 n 2 0 1 α 2 note that from a mathematical point of view the form of eq 18 is more direct and concise than eq 17 for the vg rhc function an approximation of h c or ψ f can be obtained morel seytoux et al 1996 19 h c ψ f 0 046 m 2 07 m 2 19 5 m 3 1 4 7 m 16 m 2 α vg we calculated the values of h c based on eqs 17 and 18 for 27 soils as presented in table 1 respectively as shown in fig 4 there is almost no difference between the values of h c calculated by both equations for coarse textured materials α 2 1 while for the fine textured soils α 2 1 the values of h c calculated by eq 17 are slightly small than those by eq 18 to further compare eq 17 19 we examined how the predictions of the green and ampt model eq 16 match experimental data given values of ψ f calculated by eqs 17 19 respectively reported data from a one dimensional ponded infiltration experiment were considered in which the cumulative infiltration q into the grenoble sand was measured parlange et al 1985 details on experimental setting and soil hydraulic properties are listed in table 2 when the eqs 17 19 are used to calculate ψ f for the grenoble sand the corresponding values are 0 129 m 0 1 m and 0 105 m respectively fig 5 compares the results predicted with eq 16 using these ψ f values with experimental data it can be seen that the green and ampt model with all three ψ f values matched well with the experimental data in general though the results based on the ψ f value given by eq 18 appear to be slightly better 4 2 calculation of the characteristic length lc a range of characteristic length scales have been developed for governing flow processes in the unsaturated zone associated with for example soil evaporation and drainage assouline and or 2014 lehmann et al 2008 a characteristic length l c given by the head difference between the air entry head ψ ae and critical capillary head ψ ch assouline et al 2017 or et al 2015 ψ ch ψ ae has been used to illustrate several unsaturated flow phenomena including the transition from capillary supplied stage i evaporation to vapor diffusion controlled stage ii evaporation lehmann et al 2008 the attainment of field capacity assouline and or 2014 and the zone of phase entrapment behind drainage fronts hoogland et al 2015 l c i e ψ ae and ψ ch can be obtained either from the wrc or rhc curve following the linearization procedure proposed by lehmann et al 2008 we derived analytical expressions of l c based on the mvg wrc and mvg rhc functions respectively with d 2 s e d ψ 2 0 the location of inflection point for the mvg wrc curve given by the linearized analysis is 20 ψ 1 α 1 n 1 1 n 1 2 1 n 1 n 1 1 substituting eq 18 into eq 7 the corresponding s e value can be obtained 21 s e 1 1 α 1 ψ n 1 1 1 n 1 an equation of the tangential line passing through the points ψ s e is s e s e b ψ ψ with the slope b given by 22 b d s e d ψ ψ ψ α n 1 n 1 1 ψ n 1 1 1 α ψ n 1 2 1 n 1 according to the definitions of ψ ae and ψ ch supporting information fig s2 analytical expressions for the air entry head critical capillary head and characteristic length are given as follows 23a ψ ae ψ 1 s e b ψ ch ψ s e b 23b l c ψ ch ψ ae 1 b since the functions of mvg wrc and mvg rhc are similar the analytical expression of l c based on the mvg rhc curve can be obtained by replacing α 1 and n 1 with α 2 and n 2 respectively for brevity the analytical expressions of characteristic length l c based on the vg wrc as wrc and as rhc functions are not presented here and readers can find those analytical expressions in assouline et al 2017 fig 6 compares the characteristic length l c i e ψ ae and ψ ch based on the as vg and mvg models for 22 soils fitting parameters n 1 n 2 and ω are larger than unity out of 27 presented in table 1 note that the 22 soils were renumbered for the following analysis supporting information table s2 in general the values of ψ ae ψ ch and l c estimated by different models are reasonable as they match well with each other the values of ψ ae are not significantly affected by the model chosen to describe the wrc fig 6a the values of ψ ch calculated from the as wrc and vg wrc functions are slightly lower than those based on the mvg wrc function which further leads to the lower values of characteristic length l c in particular for the fine textured soils bigger values of ψ ch fig 6b and c for results based on the rhc only as rhc and mvg rhc are compared since a simple analytical expression of characteristic length l c is not available for the vg model again the values of ψ ae calculated from the two models are almost identical fig 6d however fig 6e shows that the values of ψ ch estimated from as wrc are slightly higher than those based on mvg wrc therefore the values of l c estimated from the as rhc model are slightly higher than those of the mvg rhc model fig 6f moreover whether choosing the wrc or rhc function the values of ψ ae are not significantly affected the function selection becomes more relevant for estimating the values of ψ ch and l c both of which are smaller when estimated from the rhc function than those from the wrc function these results are the same as those of assouline et al 2017 and indicate that the value of l c for the design of evaporation column experiments should be better determined based on the wrc function for the values of ψ ch estimated from the wrc or rhc function we further calculated the corresponding value of the critical saturation degree s ch and the relative hydraulic conductivity k ch since determination of s ch has significant implications for designing the irrigation system and k ch is directly linked to the time required to attain the field capacity assouline and or 2014 fig 7 a and b shows the values of s ch and k ch estimated from the five alternative approaches respectively it can be clearly seen that both the values of s ch and k ch estimated from the rhc functions are higher than those estimated from the wrc functions which are consistent with the results of ψ ch fig 6b and e note that the values of s ch and k ch estimated from the mvg rhc function are the highest for most of soils moreover the results shown in fig 7b demonstrates that the time required to attain the field capacity is faster if the value of k ch is estimated from the rhc functions instead of the wrc functions assouline et al 2017 5 conclusions analytical expressions of the soil hydraulic properties are essential for accurate modeling hydrological processes in unsaturated porous media in this study the modified vg model the mvg model consisting of the water retention curve proposed by troch 1993 the mvg wrc function and the relative hydraulic conductivity rhc function proposed by kong et al 2016 the mvg rhc function were validated using a published dataset with 27 soils covering a wide range of soil textures from sand to silt clay loam results show that the mvg model is more accurate and flexible than the original vg model especially for predicting the relative hydraulic conductivity in addition the expressions of the mvg model can be easily integrated and differentiated to facilitate derivation of analytical solutions relationships between free fitting parameters of the water retention curve and relative hydraulic conductivity function of the mvg model were established based on the measured data the mvg model was further applied to derive analytical expressions for the wetting front pressure ψ f which is crucial in the green and ampt model for ponded infiltration and the characteristic length l c i e the air entry head ψ ae and critical capillary head ψ ch which characterize flow processes e g drainage or evaporation in unsaturated porous media the value of ψ f was found to be inversely proportional to the fitting parameter α 2 of the mvg rhc function moreover we calculated the values of ψ ae ψ ch and l c for 22 soils fitting parameters n 1 n 2 and ω is larger than unity results show that the values of ψ ae are not significantly affected by the model chosen to describe the wrc or rhc while the values of ψ ch estimated from wrc are higher than those calculated based on rhc consequently the values of l c estimated from the wrc are higher than those calculated from the rhc this indicates that the value of l c for the design of evaporation column experiments should be better determined from the wrc function furthermore the corresponding values of the critical saturation degree s ch and the relative hydraulic conductivity k ch for each of ψ ch were calculated the values of s ch and k ch estimated from the rhc functions are higher than those estimated from the wrc functions consistent with the results of ψ ch although the mvg model provides good predictions high quality data that cover a variety of soil textures are required to further test this model and the empirical relationships between parameters of the wrc and rhc competing interests the authors declare that there is no

6648,there are different trend identification methodologies in the literature but almost all are for monotonic trend searches within a given hydro meteorological time series partially at equal epochs or holistically over the whole record duration the most important question is how to identify within the same time series successive trends of different durations and slopes for this purpose successive arithmetic average methodology sam is proposed in this paper first for a set of trends visual inspection and then their quantitative duration and slope calculations this method provides to identify peak and valley change points years trends durations and slopes the most significant benefit from sam is that there is no need for preliminary assumptions and trends identifications are straight forward the only limitation of the method is short length time series absolute relative percentage error control is suggested as 10 for separation of successive partial trend differences the application of sam methodology is presented for more than seventy year duration total annual rainfall records from seven geographic and climate regions in turkey it has been calculated that both increasing and decreasing trend durations have at the maximum 4 5 year duration according to the calculations except at one meteorology station almost all the trend slopes are negative which may be an initial signal for climate change impact indicating the rainfall decreases in recent years over turkey keywords change point partial sam slope trend ita turkey 1 introduction the literature is full of papers that mention about the significance of trend component analysis in hydro meteorological time series and such researches gained unprecedented frequency due to the significance of climate change impact on water resources environment health and ecosystems ipcc 2001 2007 chen et al 2006 kundzewicz et al 2007 apart from the classical probabilistic statistical and stochastic modeling alternatives trend identification methodologies provide a room for climate change effect identification and interpretation in the literature trend identification methodologies advanced along two groups namely parametric and non parametric methods it is known that the parametric methods have more powerful results than non parametric alternatives but they have restrictive assumptions as serial independence and normal probability distribution function pdf requirements these methods cannot take into consideration outliers whereas the non parametric approaches help on this point even with non normal pdfs the first trend detection test in time series analysis is due to mann 1945 and kendall 1975 in short as mann kendall mk test this method is supported by sen 1968 slope calculation procedure various researchers have applied this methodology for trend identification with its pros and cons hirsch et al 1982 hamed and rao 1998 van belle and hughes 1984 zetterqvist 1991 zhang et al 2001 2004 burn and elnur 2002 yue et al 2002 adamowski and bougadis 2003 yue and wang 2004 yue and pilon 2004 arora et al 2005 aziz and burn 2006 gemmer et al 2004 kundzewicz and robson 2004 önöz and bayazit 2011 farshad et al 2015 on the other hand recently şen 2012 2014 2017a b proposed a simple and effective method for trend detection by means of the innovative trend analysis ita approach which has attracted many researchers and they applied it to various hydro meteorological records sonali and kumar 2013 elousssi et al 2016 wu and qian 2017 dabanlı et al 2016 almazroui et al 2017 2018 şen et al 2017 tabari et al 2017 mohorji et al 2017 güçlü 2018a b güçlü et al 2018 alashan 2018 cui et al 2017 zarei and eslamian 2017 ahmad et al 2018 yan et al 2018 güçlü et al 2018a used the ita for rainfall trend qualifications based on the frequency intensity duration curves and he compared different interrelated data sets on the same graph the first appearance of change point problem is due to page 1954 1955 1957 in a detailed statistical mathematical form with consideration of cumulative sums cusums methodology later a series of researches has appeared about the change point by various authors in the statistics domain for instance sen and srivastava 1975a suggested various tests for the change point identification in a mean level assuming a normal pdf model by the maximum likelihood estimation method but the problem became intractable analytically and therefore monte carlo simulation approach is used as a tedious approach interferences about possible change point identification through the bayesian approach is presented by smith 1975 and adams and mackay 2007 in the same year mcgilchrist and woodyer 1975 considered a distribution free cusums and similarly sen and srivastave 1975b also suggested distribution free techniques in these works the priory assumption was a known pdf but pettitt 1979 provided a methodology by releasing this assumption he assumed a change point existence within a given time series and then two sub sets of the time series prior and posterior to the change point are considered with their probability distribution functions pdfs he concluded that if two pdfs are different from each other than a change point exists in his approach the null hypothesis was no change against the change alternative hypothesis in the procedure he used a version of mann whithey statistics for the problem and derived approximately significant probabilities for testing no change against change in all the aforementioned works there is no indication about change point usage for monotonic or partial trend identifications the main concern in all the above literature works can be summarized in three points as 1 the cumulative sums 2 mean level change and 3 consideration of the main time series in two or more complementary sub series that may not have equal lengths the significant highligths of the sam methodology include that it is a new partial trend methodology without any assumption with the change point concept it identifies peak and trought change points hence partial trend components and provides initial and ending points of partial trend durations and slopes the main purpose of this paper is to suggest and demonstrate a new change point methodology by taking into consideration three subsequent point indication for a peak or through without any assumption this new methodology depends on the successive arithmetic average method sam which is straight forward in applications without any difficulty the application of the methodology is presented for seven long term 70 year annual total rainfall data from seven different geographic and climatologic regions of turkey 2 change point methodology the idea behind the change point is a set of three successive points scan from the beginning of a given hydro meteorological record until the end if the middle point is either above or below the neighbouring points then it is a change point which is known also as the turning point or break point in the literature a set of measurement data where every observation is greater than the next would have no turning point whatsoever although there are turning point tests in the statistical literature kendall and staurt 1988 those who work with the hydro meteorological time series analysis did not care for them because of the availability of some common classical and practically well known techniques for use the problem is to search for the change points in a hydro meteorological record series for trend identification not within pre selected time intervals but among natural change point occurrences in previous literature studies most often predetermined trend periods are considered either over the whole record length or equal halves or equal periods even more than two pieces mann 1945 kendall 1975 sen 1968 şen 2012 2014 2017b for the natural change point trend identification let the record series be x1 x2 xn where n is the record length the methodology presented in this paper can be summarized through the following steps 1 generate from the original hydro meteorological time series the arithmetic averages x i through the successive averages method sam according to the following formulation 1 x i i 1 n 1 i j 1 i x j 2 search for the change points in the sam time series sequence for local peaks and throughs the following statements are for local peak change point 2 if x i 1 x i x i 1 t h e n f i x i p x i o t h e r w i s e x i this statement provides local peak change point location in the original time series at ip x i position 3 repeat the similar procedure this time for the local through points inside the sam series throughout the original time series as 3 if x i 1 x i x i 1 t h e n f i x i t x i o t h e r w i s e x i which locates in the original time series a local trough change point at it x i position 4 after the execution of the two last steps change point locations are clearly identified along time axis it is worth to notice that peak and through change points follow each other alternatively 5 show the change points on the original time series graph so that visually one can appreciate the positions of the change points within the original record and one can make visual linguistic interpretations if necessary for instance the time durations between two peak through change points are not equal and each duration implies a partial trend within itself 6 the connection of successive two change points by straight line yields to succession of partial duration trends if the initial and final points of a trend have two successive averages x i a n d x j corresponding to two different years y i a n d y j then the slope sij of this trend is calculated by the following expression 4 s i j x j x i y j y i 7 again visually one can compare successive pair of the local trends and the ones that are very close to each other on slope values can be considered together as a single trend all these steps are applied quantitatively in the following sections to actual annual rainfall records 3 study area and data fig 1 indicates seven geographical and climate regions of turkey each with different air movements during summer and winter seasons the most precipitation receiving region is along the black sea coast the black sea region is one of the dynamic environments subject to seasonal variations because of regional atmospheric features it lies along the whole northern part of turkey which is under the effect of north atlantic oscillation nao and siberian air masses and they are frequently effective as frontal rainfall occurrences especially in the northeastern part of the region parallel to the sea coast are the high mountains which cause to local orographic rainfall occurrences in addition to frontal ones according to the black sea climate index constructed using more than 100 year long time series of the north atlantic oscillation the sea surface temperature air temperature and sea level anomaly provide a composite representation of the dominant regional climate variability mode and explains 46 of the total variance oğuz et al 2006 the representative meteorology station is at samsun city along the coastal area the marmara region has the european and asian sides separated by the bosporus straight in istanbul than connects the black sea to the marmara sea and then onwards towards the south to the aegean sea and mediterranean sea it has a temperate climate as a mergence area of the black sea and mediterranean sea climatic features the moderate wind climate of the marmara region is strongly influenced by land topography the region is composed of low lying topography surrounding the turkish straits system bosporus and dardanelles as a passage way for cold wind systems from the north and for cyclones moving from the aegean into the black sea brody and nestor 1980 this region has transitional climate types as humid sub climatic temperate and warm continental and mediterranean climate effects the oldest meteorology station in turkey namely istanbul florya is located on the european side for the application in this paper in the aegean sea region the topography has mountains perpendicular to the sea shores and this provides easy penetration of westerly moist air movement long distances into the land warm mediterranean climate prevails in this region with modifications towards the north close to the marmara region izmir city along the aegean sea coastal area is selected as the representative meteorology station for this study the mediterranean region has taurus mountains parallel to the coastal areas and they leave the moisture laden southerly air movements along the coastal area and hinder penetrations to the central turkey summer seasons are hot and winters have moderate cool weather occurrences the central region is in the form of a closed basin where most of the time the rainfall occurrences are of convective type during summer seasons but in winters frontal air movements provide rainfall and snow under the continental climate regime this region is represented by konya meteorology station monthly rainfall amounts the southeastern province of turkey is represented by the annual rainfall records at şanlıurfa city along the syrian border this region has very hot summer months whereas during the winter season temperate continental climatic effects prevail finally in the eastern region winter seasons are very cold with few monthly summer seasons of temperate and warm continental climate features this region has the highest mountains in turkey with heavy snow falls in late fall winter and early spring months in this area the most populated city meteorology station monthly rainfall amounts are considered for application and this is the van city meteorology station in fig 1 the location of each meteorology station is shown with and annual rainfall records availability from 1939 to 2010 inclusively for the quantitative applications the location and statistical characteristics of the seven meteorology stations are given in table 1 it is obvious from this table that the most annual mean rainfall events take place along the coastal areas starting from the black sea samsun aegean sea izmir mediterranean sea adana and marmara sea istanbul the least rainfall amounts are in the southeastern provinces şanlıurfa and van whereas in the central anatolian region the annual mean rainfall amounts are in the moderate range according to the standard deviation values the most rainfall variability regions are also along the coastal areas 4 application and discussion prior to the application of the sam the probabilistic behavior of each station rainfall records is given in fig 2 through the cumulative distribution function cdf form with exceedance probability levels at a set of return periods 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year 100 year 250 year and 500 year and corresponding to risk levels 0 50 0 20 0 10 0 04 0 02 0 01 0 004 and 0 002 it is obvious that they have rather different cdfs with different parameters for each climate region of turkey the reflections of the return periods and risk levels are presented in table 2 collectively in 2 year return period the black sea representative city samsun generates the maximum rainfall with the least amounts at the central anatolia and the southwestern provinces of turkey which are the driest regions in the country see table 3 as for the sam application consequent graphs to available time series together with the original meteorology record series are presented in fig 3 on which the change points and trend are shown on the left hand side the graphs are obtained after the application of the seven steps in the change point methodology section for sam series with change points and the right hand side graphs are for corresponding change points and the trends of irregular durations as they appear naturally in the original records in these figures two successive peak and through change points correspond to the initial and final locations of partial trends on the right hand side graphs partial trends are given on the original records based on the natural peak and through point s appearance in the left hand side sam graphs it is obvious that in both cases peak and trough change point successions the trends are very close to each other sole dependence on one type of change point sequence say peak or trough does not make very significant difference in the positions of the partial trends the most difference between the two types of the change points appears at the very beginnings of the records especially because of the initial warm up portion of about 10 year duration this is due to the small sample sizes which causes bias effects more detailed numerical values about each meteorology station is given in tables 4 10 in sequence of the meteorology stations as istanbul florya i̇zmir şanlıurfa konya van adana and samsun the number of peak and trough change points in i̇stanbul florya meteorology station is 19 change points each in the table the occurrence years of the change points duration of each trend data values of each change point trend slopes and relative error of each trend compared with the previous one is presented numerically the average durations of peak and trough trends are 3 7 and 3 8 years respectively this implies that on the average one can consider by rounding the average persistence of trend duration as about 4 years in the same table successive trend slopes are given as positive and negative numerical values with their relative slope errors in the last columns in cases of slope error less than 0 10 then the two or more successive partial trends can be thought as a single trend in the peak slope error column there are three cases indicated with bold italics with less than 10 error at 1964 1969 and 1980 hence the 4 year and 2 year partial trend durations can be combined leading to 6 year partial trend duration from 1964 to 1970 likewise partial trends between 1976 and 1982 can be thought as a single decreasing 7 year partial trend the reader can interpret the following tables in the same way in fig 3 i̇zmir meteorology station numerical partial trends are presented with all values in table 5 similar to the previous table at this station there are 19 peak and 18 trough change points the same rules are valid also in the interpretation of this and the following tables for different meteorology stations in this station the mean partial trend durations between two successive peak trough change points is about 4 5 years which can be considered as a round value of 5 years to be on the safe side table 6 is for şanlıurfa meteorology station in the southeastern province of turkey along the syrian border with 19 change points peak and trough cases similar peak and trough change points are valid for şanlıurfa meteorology station as for the i̇zmir station and relevant partial trend numerical values are shown in table 6 where on the average the round trend duration is about 4 years table 7 is for konya meteorology station partial trend description values where there appear 15 peak or valley change point occurrences in konya meteorology station on the average the partial trend durations also appear as 4 years table 8 is for eastern turkey meteorology station van which shows 17 peak and 16 valley change points the partial trend durations are almost equal to each other and for practical studies it can be recommended as 4 years in table 9 adana meteorology station trend features are given numerically finally table 10 is for samsun meteorology station along the black sea coastal area with 17 peak and 16 valley change point possession herein the partial trend duration can be adapted from peak and valley trends as 4 years table 11 indicates collectively peak and valley change points with partial increasing and decreasing trend durations total rainfall during each trend and trend slope for each meteorology station this table shows that the maximum trend duration is 4 5 year for each case according to the values in this table except at adana meteorology station almost all the trend slopes are negative which may be initial signal for climate change impact indicating the rainfall decreases in recent years in turkey after all what have been explained above the value the suggested methodology its research value and superiority over the existing trend methodologies can be summarized briefly along the following points 1 in many time series whether hydro meteorological or industrial or any type there are surplus and deficit periods which may have local trend components which can be identified by the sam methodology easily 2 the sam methodology provides increasing and decreasing successive trend components partially within a given time series which provide better management works say in water resources systems 3 other trend methodologies provide a single holistic trend component for a given time series and in this manner one cannot appreciate possible internal changes that may provide risks or reliabilities concerning different time durations 4 the sam methodology provides on the average peak and valley change points and hence partial trend durations that are the most significant quantitative values for future planning and management studies 5 the sam methodology does require neither the normal distribution of the time series records nor serially independence as with other methodologies for trend identification in the literature 6 the only restrictive point is the number of records which is recommended for practical applications not less than 15 values 5 conclusions an innovative methodology is presented for detection of embedded partial trend components of various durations slopes and intercepts in a hydro meteorological record the basis of the approach is successive arithmetic average method sam which identifies a sequence of change points in the successive mean series of a given record then these change point locations are carried onto the original series with peak and through points finally connection of each successive change point types generates the partial trend components within the given series the methodology provides the calculation of each partial trend component initial and ending points in time and average values leading to the slope calculation the relative error between each partial trend provides useful information whether to consider the two or more as a single trend which is recommended in cases of less than 10 the application is presented for seven annual rainfall records from seven different geographical and climatological regions of turkey in the meantime the best probability distribution functions pdfs are identified for each meteorology station with quantitative values for a set of return periods and risk levels finally the change point based sam application results are presented in graphical and table forms with meaningful interpretations it has been calculated that both increasing and decreasing trend durations are at the maximum about 4 5 years the sole restriction of the sam methodology is the time series length as in any probabilistic statistical and stochastic modeling the sam approach does not depend on any pre conditional assumptions or restrictions and hence can be applied for time series in any sector 6 decleration of interest statement i disclose that i do not have any financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that could inappropriately influence bias my work

in the statistics domain for instance sen and srivastava 1975a suggested various tests for the change point identification in a mean level assuming a normal pdf model by the maximum likelihood estimation method but the problem became intractable analytically and therefore monte carlo simulation approach is used as a tedious approach interferences about possible change point identification through the bayesian approach is presented by smith 1975 and adams and mackay 2007 in the same year mcgilchrist and woodyer 1975 considered a distribution free cusums and similarly sen and srivastave 1975b also suggested distribution free techniques in these works the priory assumption was a known pdf but pettitt 1979 provided a methodology by releasing this assumption he assumed a change point existence within a given time series and then two sub sets of the time series prior and posterior to the change point are considered with their probability distribution functions pdfs he concluded that if two pdfs are different from each other than a change point exists in his approach the null hypothesis was no change against the change alternative hypothesis in the procedure he used a version of mann whithey statistics for the problem and derived approximately significant probabilities for testing no change against change in all the aforementioned works there is no indication about change point usage for monotonic or partial trend identifications the main concern in all the above literature works can be summarized in three points as 1 the cumulative sums 2 mean level change and 3 consideration of the main time series in two or more complementary sub series that may not have equal lengths the significant highligths of the sam methodology include that it is a new partial trend methodology without any assumption with the change point concept it identifies peak and trought change points hence partial trend components and provides initial and ending points of partial trend durations and slopes the main purpose of this paper is to suggest and demonstrate a new change point methodology by taking into consideration three subsequent point indication for a peak or through without any assumption this new methodology depends on the successive arithmetic average method sam which is straight forward in applications without any difficulty the application of the methodology is presented for seven long term 70 year annual total rainfall data from seven different geographic and climatologic regions of turkey 2 change point methodology the idea behind the change point is a set of three successive points scan from the beginning of a given hydro meteorological record until the end if the middle point is either above or below the neighbouring points then it is a change point which is known also as the turning point or break point in the literature a set of measurement data where every observation is greater than the next would have no turning point whatsoever although there are turning point tests in the statistical literature kendall and staurt 1988 those who work with the hydro meteorological time series analysis did not care for them because of the availability of some common classical and practically well known techniques for use the problem is to search for the change points in a hydro meteorological record series for trend identification not within pre selected time intervals but among natural change point occurrences in previous literature studies most often predetermined trend periods are considered either over the whole record length or equal halves or equal periods even more than two pieces mann 1945 kendall 1975 sen 1968 şen 2012 2014 2017b for the natural change point trend identification let the record series be x1 x2 xn where n is the record length the methodology presented in this paper can be summarized through the following steps 1 generate from the original hydro meteorological time series the arithmetic averages x i through the successive averages method sam according to the following formulation 1 x i i 1 n 1 i j 1 i x j 2 search for the change points in the sam time series sequence for local peaks and throughs the following statements are for local peak change point 2 if x i 1 x i x i 1 t h e n f i x i p x i o t h e r w i s e x i this statement provides local peak change point location in the original time series at ip x i position 3 repeat the similar procedure this time for the local through points inside the sam series throughout the original time series as 3 if x i 1 x i x i 1 t h e n f i x i t x i o t h e r w i s e x i which locates in the original time series a local trough change point at it x i position 4 after the execution of the two last steps change point locations are clearly identified along time axis it is worth to notice that peak and through change points follow each other alternatively 5 show the change points on the original time series graph so that visually one can appreciate the positions of the change points within the original record and one can make visual linguistic interpretations if necessary for instance the time durations between two peak through change points are not equal and each duration implies a partial trend within itself 6 the connection of successive two change points by straight line yields to succession of partial duration trends if the initial and final points of a trend have two successive averages x i a n d x j corresponding to two different years y i a n d y j then the slope sij of this trend is calculated by the following expression 4 s i j x j x i y j y i 7 again visually one can compare successive pair of the local trends and the ones that are very close to each other on slope values can be considered together as a single trend all these steps are applied quantitatively in the following sections to actual annual rainfall records 3 study area and data fig 1 indicates seven geographical and climate regions of turkey each with different air movements during summer and winter seasons the most precipitation receiving region is along the black sea coast the black sea region is one of the dynamic environments subject to seasonal variations because of regional atmospheric features it lies along the whole northern part of turkey which is under the effect of north atlantic oscillation nao and siberian air masses and they are frequently effective as frontal rainfall occurrences especially in the northeastern part of the region parallel to the sea coast are the high mountains which cause to local orographic rainfall occurrences in addition to frontal ones according to the black sea climate index constructed using more than 100 year long time series of the north atlantic oscillation the sea surface temperature air temperature and sea level anomaly provide a composite representation of the dominant regional climate variability mode and explains 46 of the total variance oğuz et al 2006 the representative meteorology station is at samsun city along the coastal area the marmara region has the european and asian sides separated by the bosporus straight in istanbul than connects the black sea to the marmara sea and then onwards towards the south to the aegean sea and mediterranean sea it has a temperate climate as a mergence area of the black sea and mediterranean sea climatic features the moderate wind climate of the marmara region is strongly influenced by land topography the region is composed of low lying topography surrounding the turkish straits system bosporus and dardanelles as a passage way for cold wind systems from the north and for cyclones moving from the aegean into the black sea brody and nestor 1980 this region has transitional climate types as humid sub climatic temperate and warm continental and mediterranean climate effects the oldest meteorology station in turkey namely istanbul florya is located on the european side for the application in this paper in the aegean sea region the topography has mountains perpendicular to the sea shores and this provides easy penetration of westerly moist air movement long distances into the land warm mediterranean climate prevails in this region with modifications towards the north close to the marmara region izmir city along the aegean sea coastal area is selected as the representative meteorology station for this study the mediterranean region has taurus mountains parallel to the coastal areas and they leave the moisture laden southerly air movements along the coastal area and hinder penetrations to the central turkey summer seasons are hot and winters have moderate cool weather occurrences the central region is in the form of a closed basin where most of the time the rainfall occurrences are of convective type during summer seasons but in winters frontal air movements provide rainfall and snow under the continental climate regime this region is represented by konya meteorology station monthly rainfall amounts the southeastern province of turkey is represented by the annual rainfall records at şanlıurfa city along the syrian border this region has very hot summer months whereas during the winter season temperate continental climatic effects prevail finally in the eastern region winter seasons are very cold with few monthly summer seasons of temperate and warm continental climate features this region has the highest mountains in turkey with heavy snow falls in late fall winter and early spring months in this area the most populated city meteorology station monthly rainfall amounts are considered for application and this is the van city meteorology station in fig 1 the location of each meteorology station is shown with and annual rainfall records availability from 1939 to 2010 inclusively for the quantitative applications the location and statistical characteristics of the seven meteorology stations are given in table 1 it is obvious from this table that the most annual mean rainfall events take place along the coastal areas starting from the black sea samsun aegean sea izmir mediterranean sea adana and marmara sea istanbul the least rainfall amounts are in the southeastern provinces şanlıurfa and van whereas in the central anatolian region the annual mean rainfall amounts are in the moderate range according to the standard deviation values the most rainfall variability regions are also along the coastal areas 4 application and discussion prior to the application of the sam the probabilistic behavior of each station rainfall records is given in fig 2 through the cumulative distribution function cdf form with exceedance probability levels at a set of return periods 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year 100 year 250 year and 500 year and corresponding to risk levels 0 50 0 20 0 10 0 04 0 02 0 01 0 004 and 0 002 it is obvious that they have rather different cdfs with different parameters for each climate region of turkey the reflections of the return periods and risk levels are presented in table 2 collectively in 2 year return period the black sea representative city samsun generates the maximum rainfall with the least amounts at the central anatolia and the southwestern provinces of turkey which are the driest regions in the country see table 3 as for the sam application consequent graphs to available time series together with the original meteorology record series are presented in fig 3 on which the change points and trend are shown on the left hand side the graphs are obtained after the application of the seven steps in the change point methodology section for sam series with change points and the right hand side graphs are for corresponding change points and the trends of irregular durations as they appear naturally in the original records in these figures two successive peak and through change points correspond to the initial and final locations of partial trends on the right hand side graphs partial trends are given on the original records based on the natural peak and through point s appearance in the left hand side sam graphs it is obvious that in both cases peak and trough change point successions the trends are very close to each other sole dependence on one type of change point sequence say peak or trough does not make very significant difference in the positions of the partial trends the most difference between the two types of the change points appears at the very beginnings of the records especially because of the initial warm up portion of about 10 year duration this is due to the small sample sizes which causes bias effects more detailed numerical values about each meteorology station is given in tables 4 10 in sequence of the meteorology stations as istanbul florya i̇zmir şanlıurfa konya van adana and samsun the number of peak and trough change points in i̇stanbul florya meteorology station is 19 change points each in the table the occurrence years of the change points duration of each trend data values of each change point trend slopes and relative error of each trend compared with the previous one is presented numerically the average durations of peak and trough trends are 3 7 and 3 8 years respectively this implies that on the average one can consider by rounding the average persistence of trend duration as about 4 years in the same table successive trend slopes are given as positive and negative numerical values with their relative slope errors in the last columns in cases of slope error less than 0 10 then the two or more successive partial trends can be thought as a single trend in the peak slope error column there are three cases indicated with bold italics with less than 10 error at 1964 1969 and 1980 hence the 4 year and 2 year partial trend durations can be combined leading to 6 year partial trend duration from 1964 to 1970 likewise partial trends between 1976 and 1982 can be thought as a single decreasing 7 year partial trend the reader can interpret the following tables in the same way in fig 3 i̇zmir meteorology station numerical partial trends are presented with all values in table 5 similar to the previous table at this station there are 19 peak and 18 trough change points the same rules are valid also in the interpretation of this and the following tables for different meteorology stations in this station the mean partial trend durations between two successive peak trough change points is about 4 5 years which can be considered as a round value of 5 years to be on the safe side table 6 is for şanlıurfa meteorology station in the southeastern province of turkey along the syrian border with 19 change points peak and trough cases similar peak and trough change points are valid for şanlıurfa meteorology station as for the i̇zmir station and relevant partial trend numerical values are shown in table 6 where on the average the round trend duration is about 4 years table 7 is for konya meteorology station partial trend description values where there appear 15 peak or valley change point occurrences in konya meteorology station on the average the partial trend durations also appear as 4 years table 8 is for eastern turkey meteorology station van which shows 17 peak and 16 valley change points the partial trend durations are almost equal to each other and for practical studies it can be recommended as 4 years in table 9 adana meteorology station trend features are given numerically finally table 10 is for samsun meteorology station along the black sea coastal area with 17 peak and 16 valley change point possession herein the partial trend duration can be adapted from peak and valley trends as 4 years table 11 indicates collectively peak and valley change points with partial increasing and decreasing trend durations total rainfall during each trend and trend slope for each meteorology station this table shows that the maximum trend duration is 4 5 year for each case according to the values in this table except at adana meteorology station almost all the trend slopes are negative which may be initial signal for climate change impact indicating the rainfall decreases in recent years in turkey after all what have been explained above the value the suggested methodology its research value and superiority over the existing trend methodologies can be summarized briefly along the following points 1 in many time series whether hydro meteorological or industrial or any type there are surplus and deficit periods which may have local trend components which can be identified by the sam methodology easily 2 the sam methodology provides increasing and decreasing successive trend components partially within a given time series which provide better management works say in water resources systems 3 other trend methodologies provide a single holistic trend component for a given time series and in this manner one cannot appreciate possible internal changes that may provide risks or reliabilities concerning different time durations 4 the sam methodology provides on the average peak and valley change points and hence partial trend durations that are the most significant quantitative values for future planning and management studies 5 the sam methodology does require neither the normal distribution of the time series records nor serially independence as with other methodologies for trend identification in the literature 6 the only restrictive point is the number of records which is recommended for practical applications not less than 15 values 5 conclusions an innovative methodology is presented for detection of embedded partial trend components of various durations slopes and intercepts in a hydro meteorological record the basis of the approach is successive arithmetic average method sam which identifies a sequence of change points in the successive mean series of a given record then these change point locations are carried onto the original series with peak and through points finally connection of each successive change point types generates the partial trend components within the given series the methodology provides the calculation of each partial trend component initial and ending points in time and average values leading to the slope calculation the relative error between each partial trend provides useful information whether to consider the two or more as a single trend which is recommended in cases of less than 10 the application is presented for seven annual rainfall records from seven different geographical and climatological regions of turkey in the meantime the best probability distribution functions pdfs are identified for each meteorology station with quantitative values for a set of return periods and risk levels finally the change point based sam application results are presented in graphical and table forms with meaningful interpretations it has been calculated that both increasing and decreasing trend durations are at the maximum about 4 5 years the sole restriction of the sam methodology is the time series length as in any probabilistic statistical and stochastic modeling the sam approach does not depend on any pre conditional assumptions or restrictions and hence can be applied for time series in any sector 6 decleration of interest statement i disclose that

6649,soil moisture is a core ecohydrological element in the middle high latitude frozen area which occupies approximately 30 of the global land area the sanjiang plain an important commercial grain production area is the largest swampy low plain in a middle high latitude frozen area in china however no published studies on this region have clarified the accuracy of soil moisture data from in situ measurements the performance of ecohydrological models are also unknown in this study we compared the ability of the smap product a rs dtvgm model and two self erected soil moisture monitoring stations to capture soil moisture information in the sanjiang plain by using the triple collocation method soil moisture data were collected for 642 continuous days and the data period was divided into three frozen periods ft and two non frozen nft periods valid data supply rates of the three methods were also calculated and compared from the triple collocation method the root mean square error rmse of the smap model and in situ monitoring data sets were 0 03 0 08 and 0 05 the valid data supply rates of the smap product in the ft and nft periods were 27 1 and 57 5 respectively the pearson correlation coefficient between the smap product and the in situ monitoring dataset was 0 301 for the ft period and 0 557 for the nft period the rs dtvgm model had a data supply rate of 100 the pearson correlation coefficient for this model was 0 101 for the ft period but reached 0 726 for the nft period for the three soil moisture data sets the accuracy ranking in this middle high latitude area was smap in situ monitoring model simulation although neither smap nor the rs dtvgm model could capture the real soil moisture information for the ft period both could accurately simulate the soil moisture in the nft period the results from the rs dtvgm model demonstrated a closer relationship with in situ soil moisture measurement data relative to the smap method the in situ method provided accurate soil moisture data but its application is limited by high cost in the future the data from the three methods should be assimilated together to measure soil moisture data with high accuracy and high spatial and temporal resolution in this important area keywords smap rsdtvgm in situ monitoring soil moisture sanjiang plain triple collocation 1 introduction soil moisture refers to the water stored in the pores of soil which plays a key role in the water and energy cycles wagner et al 2003 liu et al 2017 in the following three ways first soil moisture affects energy allocation precipitation evapotranspiration koster et al 2004 taylor et al 2012 eco hydrology the carbon cycle schneider et al 2008 fan et al 2017 and subsequently the climate system wang et al 2017a b second spatial variation in soil moisture controls the processes of rainfall infiltration and surface runoff bronstert and bárdossy 1999 joshi et al 2011 third spatial patterns of soil moisture are closely related to soil respiration soil erosion solute transport wagai et al 1998 ran et al 2017 kolassa et al 2017 crop yields and the distribution of natural vegetation green and erskine 2004 wang et al 2017a b soil moisture research has tended to focus on arid regions koster et al 2004 wang et al 2017a b ran et al 2017 permafrost regions hinzman et al 1998 yoshikawa and hinzman 2003 kou et al 2017 and freeze thaw regions entekhabi et al 2004 bartsch et al 2007 chen et al 2013 cui et al 2017 this regional focus is a result of the importance of water supply human survival carbon release the global carbon cycle and eco hydrological process which are significantly influenced by soil moisture soil moisture is also very important in humid regions for its impact on flooding troch et al 1993 frozen areas an important domain for soil moisture research occupy approximately 30 of the global land area williams and smith 1989 affected by seasonal freeze thaw cycles soil moisture is a fundamental factor for identifying and predicting freeze thaw processes luo et al 2003 chen et al 2013 seasonal freeze thaw cycles control the phase of water resulting in significant changes in the amount of liquid soil moisture present and influencing soil evaporation and canopy transpiration steelman and endres 2012 additionally when freezing begins the hydraulic conductivity of soil decreases dramatically and the thermal conductivity increases sinha and cherkauer 2008 ghazavi and roustaei 2013 the freeze thaw process makes soil moisture research in these regions difficult because the transport and phase transitions of soil moisture are more complex luo et al 2003 entekhabi et al 2004 methods for studying the content transfer and temporal spatial distribution of soil moisture in frozen areas include remote sensing surveys hydrological models and in situ monitoring among the remote sensing technologies microwave remote sensing is the most suitable technology for detecting soil moisture because microwave radiation is very sensitive to the water content in the surface layer this is because of the pronounced increase in the soil dielectric constant that occurs with an increasing water content ulaby et al 1982 wagner et al 2007 one advantage of microwave remote sensing is that it provides average area estimates with a spatial resolution that ranges from dozens to thousands of square kilometers njoku et al 2003 kerr et al 2012 and with a daily temporal resolution depending on the method rautiainen et al 2012 available soil moisture information can be extracted from microwave data products such as the advanced scatterometer ascat soil moisture retrievals wagner et al 1999 the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system sensor amsr e njoku et al 2003 the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos soil moisture level 2 user data product smudp2 file kerr et al 2010 and the newly launched soil moisture active passive smap mission entekhabi et al 2010 liu et al 2017 smap uses the l band which is the most sensitive band able to detect soil moisture smap can supply more accurate soil moisture data compared with other microwave remote sensing methods cui et al 2017 the hydrological model is another important method used to predict soil moisture variation in frozen areas these models can simulate the soil freeze depth the effects of water and solution on winter freezing and the effect of solutes on soil freezing li et al 2012 hydrological models can be classified into two types one type is the vertical model which focuses on soil water content and transport in a deep soil layer that may exceed one meter flerchinger and hanson 1989 li et al 2000 the calculation and development of these models depend intensively on laboratory soil column experiments hansson et al 2004 as is the case with the shaw model rerchinger 1991 li et al 2012 and the sib2 model fox 1992 li and koike 2003 sadeghi et al 2017 the other type is the remote sensing driven model which focuses on the content and transport of soil moisture within the range of the plow layer 0 40 cm houser et al 1998 wagner et al 2003 these models emphasize the spatial distribution of soil moisture multi source remote sensing data are used commonly in models such as the lpj model sitch et al 2003 and the ecohat model which was used throughout the world and especially in china xia et al 2003 liu et al 2009 cai et al 2017 in situ monitoring is the most direct way to measure soil moisture in frozen areas the scale of databases gathered from soil moisture in situ monitoring stations ranges from regions to continents examples include the automated weather data network awdn and the soil climate analysis network scan in the us wang et al 2017a b the international soil moisture network with a global reach the soil moisture in mountainous terrain somomount network in switzerland pellet and hauck 2017 the nested ecohydrological wireless sensor network newsn in the heihe watershed of china ran et al 2017 the naqu and pali networks in the tibetan plateau of china and the bnu net in the genhe watershed of china cui et al 2017 these monitoring networks vary in size and focus measurements of hydrological processes may occur at the hillslope scale martini et al 2015 or catchment scale bogena et al 2010 research may focus on land atmosphere interactions and validation of remote sensing products rautiainen et al 2012 these three methods provide soil moisture information from different perspectives and at different temporal spatial scales remote sensing can provide soil moisture information with continuous spatial distribution and at different temporal scales however it can only obtain soil moisture data for the surface soil 0 5 cm ulaby et al 1982 the ecohydrological model is an advanced method for calculating and predicting soil moisture at different soil depths 0 100 cm kurylyk and watanabe 2013 this method requires mass input parameters and a complex structure making use of the model is difficult especially at large spatial scales in situ monitoring has the advantage of obtaining correct soil moisture data but it also has the disadvantage of not providing spatially continuous soil moisture information recent research has typically focused on one of these methods sanjiang plain is located in the mid high latitude frozen region of china it is the primary crop production area in northeast asia and plays the role of crop stabilizer in this region soil moisture is not only an important ecohydrological element but also a key factor for agricultural production in the sanjiang plain soil moisture research in this area has mainly focused on two aspects the first is the mechanism responsible for freeze thaw affecting soil moisture content and the vertical distribution of moisture zhang et al 2007a b li et al 2011 the second is the influence of the soil moisture on soil carbon zhang et al 2007a b zhang 2010 and nutrients wang et al 2007 ouyang et al 2013 in the frozen soil methods for researching soil moisture content include lab experiments e g undistributed soil columns zhang et al 2007a b and ecohydrological modeling ouyang et al 2013 however research is lacking in this area to clarify the data accuracy from in situ measurement the model s performance to obtain soil moisture was also unknown this study attempted to answer the first two questions by quantitatively comparing the smap soil moisture product an ecohydrological model rs dtvgm and in situ monitoring data during two complete freeze thaw cycles 642 days in the sanjiang plain the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a description of the methodology including information about the study area the smap soil moisture product the model composition the in situ monitoring data and the triple collocation method the performance of the three methods is described in section 3 and the results of the comparison and an analysis are provided in sections 4 and 5 2 methodology 2 1 study area the sanjiang plain 43 49 55 48 27 40 n 129 11 20 135 05 26 e is a vast area with low relief and is located in northeast china fig 1 it is one of largest commodity crops areas in northeast china and has a total area of 108 900 km2 annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 600 mm the annual average temperature is 1 9 c and the climate is humid and mid humid continental approximately six months out of the year have a temperature lower than 0 c chen et al 2013 bawujiu farm fig 1 47 18 47 50 n 133 50 134 33 e is located in the northeastern part of the sanjiang plain and was selected as the study area this farm is located in a typical seasonal frozen region and has been developed as a national farm by intensive agricultural activities for more than 60 years frozen events in the region influence soil moisture and thus crop growth in the subsequent year the major land use types are cultivated land forest land grassland and wetland two automatic meteorological stations s1 and s2 fig 1 located in the center and in the south of this farm respectively were established to collect soil moisture data 2 2 methods a comparative analysis method was designed fig 2 to answer two questions 1 can each of the three methods microwave remote sensing ecohydrological model and in situ monitoring capture top soil moisture information in the sanjiang plain 2 which method is the most accurate method for obtaining the information the smap soil moisture product was selected to represent the microwave remote sensing method as it is the most recent microwave soil moisture product and has been used worldwide liu et al 2017 cui et al 2017 the rs dtvgm model liu et al 2009 cai et al 2017 was chosen to represent the ecohydrological model because it is a physical model based on the water cycle and is driven by remote sensing data having better spatial resolution than the smap product in situ monitoring data from two automatic meteorological stations were established to collect direct soil moisture data in this study two complete freeze thaw cycles 642 days were divided into three frozen ft periods and two non frozen nft periods based on the 0 c air temperature each ft period began when the air temperature fell below 0 c and each nft period began when the temperature rose above 0 c soil moisture variation in the frozen area was compared and analyzed at different spatial scales 9 km 1 km and point by the three methods fig 2 2 2 1 smap soil moisture product the smap mission is the latest l band constellation dedicated to providing global scale soil moisture and frozen state data entekhabi et al 2014 the smap was launched on january 31 2015 and placed into a polar sun

reflector and an l band radar 1 26 and 1 29 ghz cui et al 2017 the smap can provide soil moisture estimates for the top 5 cm of soil with a 0 04 cm3 cm3 volumetric soil moisture retrieval accuracy at a temporal resolution of 1 3 days entekhabi et al 2014 despite the failure of the smap radar on july 7 2015 the l band radiometer continued to operate as planned and has provided routine data since

calculated independently by the nasa goddard earth observing system model version 5 geos 5 the derived emissivity was corrected by incorporating vegetation and surface roughness data and the dielectric constant was determined using the fresnel equation finally the soil moisture was calculated using a dielectric mixing model o neill et al 2016 the smap enhanced l3 radiometer global daily soil moisture products version 2 0 spl3smp e were resampled to a global cylindrical 9 km equal area scalable earth grid in this study the soil moisture retrieval am and pm data from the smap were used and averaged due to a strong diurnal variability in soil moisture for freeze thaw conditions in the fall and spring in the processing of the smap data matlab version 2016a was used to read the

site was dry land the soil moisture data sampling frequency for s1 and s2 was 15 min per sample and there were 96 samples collected each day high data sampling frequency helped to overcome the difficulty of strongly diurnal variability of soil moisture in the frozen area the in situ monitoring data 61 632 samples were processed at a daily timescale using the interactive data language idl with the mean algorithm to match the temporal scale of the smap product and model calculation results in this study the average s1 and s2 soil moisture values were used to reduce system errors from the sensor sampling 2 2 4 data analysis and evaluation by using the triple collocation method in this study three data sets that included in situ monitoring data smap data and model simulation were compared using the triple collocation method the three data sets were independent of each other the additive random errors for each data can be calculated and analyzed as well the tc method has been used widely in oceanography to estimate measurements errors for sea surface temperature it has also been used in hydrology to estimate errors in precipitation measurements and particular soil moisture measurements the specific steps and functions are represented in table 2 at the same time the pearson correlation and determination coefficients were used to analyze variation in soil moisture from these three methods 3 results 3 1 performance of the three data sets in the frozen area 3 1 1 smap soil moisture product the smap soil moisture simulation captured variations in soil moisture during a complete freeze thaw cycle but more soil moisture information was presented during the nft period 428 days than in the ft period 214 days fig 3 soil moisture was as high as 0 49 m3 m3 from mid april to mid july progressively increased from the beginning of march to mid april and then decreased to 0 05 m3 m3 from the mid july to the end of october the soil moisture content was lower during the ft period because the air temperature was lower than 0 c after the ft period when air temperature was higher the soil moisture content increased because of snowmelt on the land surface the amount of valid soil moisture data for the smap product influences its ability to measure variations in soil water content in a frozen area over a long time period smap captured valid soil information for only 304 of 642 days which amounted to only 47 4 of the total time period fig 3a the reason for this limitation was the smap satellite had a three day revisiting period which created a data gap when using this data set in this area during the ft period there were 58 soil moisture data in the three ft periods 214 days accounting for 27 1 of the entire period during the nft period there were 246 soil moisture data during the two nft periods 428 days which represented 57 5 of this period 3 1 2 rs dtvgm model the remote sensing driven model captured more variation in soil moisture in the frozen area and provided more data during both the nft and ft periods fig 4 the model simulated results which displayed higher soil water content during the nft period than in the ft period showed that the high soil water period extended from the end of april to the end of october for each year the results of the model showed variations in soil moisture variation for one freeze thaw cycle there were 642 data points during the research period meaning that soil moisture data were simulated for each day the data distribution from the simulated output was dispersed especially during the nft period 3 1 3 in situ monitoring the in situ monitoring data performed better in displaying soil moisture variations than the smap product or the remote sensing model fig 5 generally in situ monitoring data are continuous stable and accurately respond to the external environmental conditions whether during the ft or the nft period the in situ monitoring method obtained soil moisture information in the freeze thaw area each day throughout the research period there were 642 data points from the in situ monitoring stations and in situ monitoring was able to capture continuous variations in the soil water content at the same time the monitoring data reflected variations in precipitation which had a direct impact on soil moisture fig 5 this indicated that the in situ monitoring method is sensitive to meteorological conditions especially precipitation 3 2 tc results for the three methods by using the tc method the rmse for the three data sets during the ft and nft periods were calculated table 3 for each data set smap had the smallest rmse the rmse of the in situ measurements smap data and model simulation were 0 05 0 03 and 0 08 respectively during the ft period the smap data had the highest accuracy the rmse of the in situ measurements smap data and model simulation were 0 06 0 04 and 0 09 respectively during the nft period in situ measure data has the highest accuracy and the rmse was 0 01 the rmse was 0 02 and 0 02 for the smap data and model simulation respectively from the table we found that all the three soil moisture sets had a higher data accuracy during the nft period relative to the ft period 3 3 smap vs in situ monitoring soil moisture data from the smap product were compared with the in situ monitoring data using the pearson correlation method fig 6 the correlation between the two methods was weak there were 210 smap data points available for comparison with the in situ monitoring data the pearson correlation coefficient was 0 301 and the standard error was 0 036 m3 m3 the smap soil moisture average value was 0 364 m3 m3 which was larger than the value of 0 278 m3 m3 from the in situ monitoring method the data range from the smap product was 0 030 m3 m3 0 490 m3 m which was smaller than the range of 0 047 m3 m3 0 694 m3 m3 for the in situ monitoring method detailed statistical and comparative analyses for the two methods were also developed table 4 during the ft period there were only 58 data points from the smap product but 234 data points from the in situ monitoring method the smap data mean value during the ft period was 0 160 m3 m3 which was lower than the mean value of 0 175 m3 m3 from the in situ monitoring data the standard deviation for smap dataset was 0 054 m3 m3 and the standard deviation for the in situ monitoring dataset was 0 077 m3 m3 the pearson correlation coefficient for the two soil moisture datasets was 0 301 during the nft period there were more data in both datasets the mean value of the smap data was 0 373 m3 m3 and the standard deviation was 0 129 m3 m3 the mean value for the in situ monitoring data set was 0 338 m3 m3 and was smaller than the mean value for the smap dataset the standard deviation was 0 094 m3 m3 the pearson correlation coefficient was 0 557 during the nft period which was larger than during the ft period 3 4 ecohydrological model simulation vs in situ monitoring the simulation results from the rs dtvgm model were also compared with the in situ monitoring data fig 7 each of the two datasets included 642 data points the pearson correlation coefficient for the datasets was 0 530 this result indicated that these two soil moisture datasets have a stronger correlation relative to the smap data and in situ monitoring data the in situ monitoring data ranged from 0 047 m3 m3 to 0 694 m3 m3 and this range was greater than the model range of 0 014 m3 m3 to 0 314 m3 m3 the mean value for the rs dtvgm model results was 0 126 m3 m3 which was smaller than the mean value of 0 278 m3 m3 from the in situ monitoring data the two datasets from the rs dtvgm and the in situ monitoring were also compared and analyzed table 5 during the ft period there were 234 data points in each dataset the mean value of the rs dtvgm simulation result was 0 085 m3 m3 and the mean value for the in situ monitoring was 0 175 m3 m3 the standard deviations of the model and in situ monitoring results were 0 070 and 0 077 respectively the pearson correlation coefficient for the two datasets was 0 010 indicating a weak correlation between the two datasets during the nft period the two datasets showed a stronger correlation than during the ft period with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 726 the mean value for the model simulation result was 0 149 m3 m3 and the mean value from the in situ monitoring was 0 338 m3 m3 the standard deviation for the model simulation was 0 046 and the standard deviation from the in situ monitoring was 0 094 3 5 smap vs rs dtvgm model in the spatial the cumulative spatial distribution of soil moisture data from smap and model simulation during the two periods are shown in fig 8 heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of the two data sets could be detected however the spatial resolution of the smap and model simulation results were significantly different here soil moisture data during 642 continuous days were added because the smap satellite had a three day revisiting period this created a data gap when comparing the spatial distribution of soil moisture from the two methods during the ft period smap production had a high soil moisture content in the east and south of the sanjiang plain model simulations indicated a high soil moisture level in the east and north middle of the plain the two data sets displayed similar spatial distributions during the ft period during the nft period the high soil moisture areas were located in the west and middle according to the smap production similar to the smap the model simulation results also showed high soil moisture areas in the middle of the plain there were significant edge effect from the model results in the north and east because the two boundaries are two rivers in summary the two data sets had a heterogeneous spatial distribution during the ft and nft period but model results displayed more spatial details of soil moisture due to their fine spatial resolution 4 discussion 4 1 limitations of smap soil moisture information in the frozen area the ability of smap to provide soil moisture information was hindered by the limited number of valid data points and data accuracy especially during the ft period in this study there were 58 data points during the three ft periods and 201 data points during the two nft periods accounting for 27 1 and 57 5 during each period respectively the pearson correlation coefficient for the smap product and the in situ monitoring dataset was 0 113 during the ft period and 0 546 during the nft period at the same time total mean soil moisture during the nft period 5 cm depth from the smap production was higher than the in situ monitoring data 10 cm depth table 4 this may have been the result of the vegetation correction used in the smap production in this area and its influence on the final data accuracy in this study area rice was the vegetation type of the underlying surface and it was difficult for the smap production to identify such detailed land cover information in fact vegetation correction and roughness were the important factors affecting the passive microwave remote sensing abilities for soil moisture jackson 1993 the low number of valid data points and the weak correlation between smap and the in situ monitoring data indicated that smap was not able to accurately measure soil moisture in this middle high latitude frozen area plant growth and snow cover are the two factors influencing the data accuracy of smap during the nft period microwave remote sensing e g smap was rarely influenced by the meteorological condition e g precipitation mist cloud due to the strong penetrability of the long band length of microwaves ulaby et al 1982 entekhabi et al 2004 however plant growth and litter from crop harvests can directly influence data accuracy moran et al 2002 bushy plants hinder microwaves at the soil surface thus making it more difficult to capture the detailed soil information received by the sensor hallikainen et al 1985 in our research area the land surface was covered by crops during the nft period resulting in fewer valid data points for smap during the ft period snow cover in the freeze thaw area was the main reason for loss of soil information from smap the smap soil product was retrieved using l band passive microwave radiometer but thick snow cover sheltered the soil moisture signal njoku et al 2003 kim et al 2011 in this area the average snow thickness in a year can reach 30 50 cm chen et al 2013 leading to significant decline in soil moisture accuracy 4 2 advantages and difficulties of using the rs dtvgm to obtain soil moisture measurements in the frozen area for the number of data and the correlation with in situ measurements performance of the rs dtvgm model was greater than the performance of the smap soil moisture product there were 642 data points collected during the entire research period and the pearson correlation coefficient during the nft period reached 0 726 however the rs dtvgm performance was not satisfactory during the ft period a significant advantage of the model is that it can present continuous soil moisture data and predict soil moisture variations for different scenarios arya and paris 1981 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 by using the remote sensing driven model researchers can obtain raster soil moisture data at various spatial scales easton et al 2008 cai et al 2017 although the model showed fair performance in obtaining soil moisture data during the nft period it had two problems in the simulation process in the frozen areas first during the ft period the results simulated by the model were not sufficiently accurate as supported by the pearson correlation coefficient this occurred because the phase transition during the frozen period was too complex for the mathematical functions to accurately describe variations in soil moisture edwards and cresser 1992 viterbo et al 1999 kværnø and øygarden 2006 second in seasonal frozen areas the freeze thaw process occurred very frequently there may be 3 5 freeze thaw cycles in one day frauenfeld et al 2004 chen et al 2013 consequently the soil moisture content changed frequently with each freeze thaw cycle li et al 2000 hansson et al 2004 unfortunately the model s temporal scale was one day so the model was not able to capture the real soil moisture variation during the freeze thaw cycles 4 3 role of in situ monitoring in capturing real soil information in the frozen area in the future in this study the in situ monitoring data represented real soil moisture variations in the frozen area and validated the smap product and the model simulation results although the in situ monitoring data performed well at presenting soil moisture data for this area this method cannot play a leading role in obtaining and supplying soil moisture data at large spatial scales e g regional scale watershed scale in the future three reasons for the limited application of in situ monitoring data include the high cost of monitoring the discontinuous stations across a research area and the sensor limitation in frozen conditions in this study the average cost for each small auto meteorological station exceeded 5 000 and the harsh natural conditions increased the costs of operation and maintenance the application of these data is also limited by the inherent discontinuous spatial distribution of the data especially for single in situ monitoring stations like those used in this study lastly volumetric soil moisture was obtained using the sensor however it is easier to capture the liquid soil water than all the water in the soil especially in the frozen condition this is because the in situ measurement rarely considers the soil bulk density in different areas and this will influence the data accuracy and reliability 4 4 scale entanglement of multi source soil moisture data in the frozen area scale entanglement samaniego et al 2010 kumar et al 2013 is an unavoidable issue when comparing multi sources data in the frozen area in this research the smap soil moisture product model calculation results and in situ monitoring data had spatial scales of 9 km 1 km and point respectively when the three datasets were compared the spatial scale differences of these three datasets produced some uncertainties in this study area the land surface is very homogenous but the coarse spatial resolution of the smap data resulted in mixed end member issues fisher et al 2006 tang et al 2010 nijland et al 2016 and influenced the data accuracy as well the analysis results despite the existing scale entanglements this research still revealed and compared the performance of the three methods for capturing soil moisture in the frozen area successfully 5 conclusion in this study the performance of three methods microwave remote sensing smap product remote sensing driven model rs dtvgm and in situ monitoring were compared and analyzed for capturing soil moisture information in the sanjiang plain the entire research period was divided into three ft periods and two nft periods and the supply rates of valid data and the accuracy of the data of the three methods were calculated and compared using the triple collocation method the results showed that the rmses of the three data sets were 0 03 0 08 and 0 05 the valid data supply rates of the smap product in the ft and nft periods were 27 1 and 57 5 respectively the pearson correlation coefficient between the smap product and the in situ monitoring dataset was 0 301 during the ft period and 0 557 during the nft period the rs dtvgm model had a data supply rate of 100 the pearson correlation coefficient for this model was 0 101 during the ft period but the value reached 0 726 during the nft period for the three soil moisture data sets the accuracy ranking in this middle high latitude area was smap in situ monitoring model simulation however neither the smap nor the rs dtvgm model could capture the real soil moisture information during the ft period and the results from rs dtvgm were closer to in situ measurements during the nft period than the smap method the in situ method can supply accurate soil moisture data but its role is limited by the high cost and discontinuous distribution of stations single in situ soil moisture stations used in this research should be combined with the international soil moisture network in future research in the future the data from the three methods should be assimilated together to achieve soil moisture data with a higher accuracy spatial and temporal resolution in this important area acknowledgements the authors thank the administrators in the bawujiu farm and national natural

6649,soil moisture is a core ecohydrological element in the middle high latitude frozen area which occupies approximately 30 of the global land area the sanjiang plain an important commercial grain production area is the largest swampy low plain in a middle high latitude frozen area in china however no published studies on this region have clarified the accuracy of soil moisture data from in situ measurements the performance of ecohydrological models are also unknown in this study we compared the ability of the smap product a rs dtvgm model and two self erected soil moisture monitoring stations to capture soil moisture information in the sanjiang plain by using the triple collocation method soil moisture data were collected for 642 continuous days and the data period was divided into three frozen periods ft and two non frozen nft periods valid data supply rates of the three methods were also calculated and compared from the triple collocation method the root mean square error rmse of the smap model and in situ monitoring data sets were 0 03 0 08 and 0 05 the valid data supply rates of the smap product in the ft and nft periods were 27 1 and 57 5 respectively the pearson correlation coefficient between the smap product and the in situ monitoring dataset was 0 301 for the ft period and 0 557 for the nft period the rs dtvgm model had a data supply rate of 100 the pearson correlation coefficient for this model was 0 101 for the ft period but reached 0 726 for the nft period for the three soil moisture data sets the accuracy ranking in this middle high latitude area was smap in situ monitoring model simulation although neither smap nor the rs dtvgm model could capture the real soil moisture information for the ft period both could accurately simulate the soil moisture in the nft period the results from the rs dtvgm model demonstrated a closer relationship with in situ soil moisture measurement data relative to the smap method the in situ method provided accurate soil moisture data but its application is limited by high cost in the future the data from the three methods should be assimilated together to measure soil moisture data with high accuracy and high spatial and temporal resolution in this important area keywords smap rsdtvgm in situ monitoring soil moisture sanjiang plain triple collocation 1 introduction soil moisture refers to the water stored in the pores of soil which plays a key role in the water and energy cycles wagner et al 2003 liu et al 2017 in the following three ways first soil moisture affects energy allocation precipitation evapotranspiration koster et al 2004 taylor et al 2012 eco hydrology the carbon cycle schneider et al 2008 fan et al 2017 and subsequently the climate system wang et al 2017a b second

related to soil respiration soil erosion solute transport wagai et al 1998 ran et al 2017 kolassa et al 2017 crop yields and the distribution of natural vegetation green and erskine 2004 wang et al 2017a b soil moisture research has tended to focus on arid regions koster et al 2004 wang et al 2017a b ran et al 2017 permafrost regions hinzman et al 1998 yoshikawa and hinzman 2003 kou et al 2017 and freeze thaw regions entekhabi et al 2004 bartsch et al 2007 chen et al 2013 cui et al 2017 this regional focus is a result of the importance of water supply human survival carbon release the global carbon cycle and eco hydrological process which are significantly influenced by soil moisture soil moisture is also very important in humid regions for its impact on flooding troch et al 1993 frozen areas an important domain for soil moisture research occupy approximately 30 of the global land area williams and smith 1989 affected by seasonal freeze thaw cycles soil moisture is a fundamental factor for identifying and predicting freeze thaw processes luo et al 2003 chen et al 2013 seasonal freeze thaw cycles control the phase of water resulting in significant changes in the amount of liquid soil moisture present and influencing soil evaporation and canopy transpiration steelman and endres 2012 additionally when freezing begins the hydraulic conductivity of soil decreases dramatically and the thermal conductivity increases sinha and cherkauer 2008 ghazavi and roustaei 2013 the freeze thaw process makes soil moisture research in these regions difficult because the transport and phase transitions of soil moisture are more complex luo et al 2003 entekhabi et al 2004 methods for studying the content transfer and temporal spatial distribution of soil moisture in frozen areas include remote sensing surveys hydrological models and in situ monitoring among the remote sensing technologies microwave remote sensing is the most suitable technology for detecting soil moisture because microwave radiation is very sensitive to the water content in the surface layer this is because of the pronounced increase in the soil dielectric constant that occurs with an increasing water content ulaby et al 1982 wagner et al 2007 one advantage of microwave remote sensing is that it provides average area estimates with a spatial resolution that ranges from dozens to thousands of square kilometers njoku et al 2003 kerr et al 2012 and with a daily temporal resolution depending on the method rautiainen et al 2012 available soil moisture information can be extracted from microwave data products such as the advanced scatterometer ascat soil moisture retrievals wagner et al 1999 the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system sensor amsr e njoku et al 2003 the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos soil moisture level 2 user data product smudp2 file kerr et al 2010 and the newly launched soil moisture active passive smap mission entekhabi et al 2010 liu et al 2017 smap uses the l band which is the most sensitive band able to detect soil moisture smap can supply more accurate soil moisture data compared with other microwave remote sensing methods cui et al 2017 the hydrological model is another important method used to predict soil moisture variation in frozen areas these models can simulate the soil freeze depth the effects of water and solution on winter freezing and the effect of solutes on soil freezing li et al 2012 hydrological models can be classified into two types one type is the vertical model which focuses on soil water content and transport in a deep soil layer that may exceed one meter flerchinger and hanson 1989 li et al 2000 the calculation and development of these models depend intensively on laboratory soil column experiments hansson et al 2004 as is the case with the shaw model rerchinger 1991 li et al 2012 and the sib2 model fox 1992 li and koike 2003 sadeghi et al 2017 the other type is the remote sensing driven model which focuses on the content and transport of soil moisture within the range of the plow layer 0 40 cm houser et al 1998 wagner et al 2003 these models emphasize the spatial distribution of soil moisture multi source remote sensing data are used commonly in models such as the lpj model sitch et al 2003 and the ecohat model which was used throughout the world and especially in china xia et al 2003 liu et al 2009 cai et al 2017 in situ monitoring is the most direct way to measure soil moisture in frozen areas the scale of databases gathered from soil moisture in situ monitoring stations ranges from regions to continents examples include the automated weather data network awdn and the soil climate analysis network scan in the us wang et al 2017a b the international soil moisture network with a global reach the soil moisture in mountainous terrain somomount network in switzerland pellet and hauck 2017 the nested ecohydrological wireless sensor network newsn in the heihe watershed of china ran et al 2017 the naqu and pali networks in the tibetan plateau of china and the bnu net in the genhe watershed of china cui et al 2017 these monitoring networks vary in size and focus measurements of hydrological processes may occur at the hillslope scale martini et al 2015 or catchment scale bogena et al 2010 research may focus on land atmosphere interactions and validation of remote sensing products rautiainen et al 2012 these three methods provide soil moisture information from different perspectives and at different temporal spatial scales remote sensing can provide soil moisture information with continuous spatial distribution and at different temporal scales however it can only obtain soil moisture data for the surface soil 0 5 cm ulaby et al 1982 the ecohydrological model is an advanced method for calculating and predicting soil moisture at different soil depths 0 100 cm kurylyk and watanabe 2013 this method requires mass input parameters and a complex structure making use of the model is difficult especially at large spatial scales in situ monitoring has the advantage of obtaining correct soil moisture data but it also has the disadvantage of not providing spatially continuous soil moisture information recent research has typically focused on one of these methods sanjiang plain is located in the mid high latitude frozen region of china it is the primary crop production area in northeast asia and plays the role of crop stabilizer in this region soil moisture is not only an important ecohydrological element but also a key factor for agricultural production in the sanjiang plain soil moisture research in this area has mainly focused on two aspects the first is the mechanism responsible for freeze thaw affecting soil moisture content and the vertical distribution of moisture zhang et al 2007a b li et al 2011 the second is the influence of the soil moisture on soil carbon zhang et al 2007a b zhang 2010 and nutrients wang et al 2007 ouyang et al 2013 in the frozen soil methods for researching soil moisture content include lab experiments e g undistributed soil columns zhang et al 2007a b and ecohydrological modeling ouyang et al 2013 however research is lacking in this area to clarify the data accuracy from in situ measurement the model s performance to obtain soil moisture was also unknown this study attempted to answer the first two questions by quantitatively comparing the smap soil moisture product an ecohydrological model rs dtvgm and in situ monitoring data during two complete freeze thaw cycles 642 days in the sanjiang plain the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a description of the methodology including information about the study area the smap soil moisture product the model composition the in situ monitoring data and the triple collocation method the performance of the three methods is described in section 3 and the results of the comparison and an analysis are provided in sections 4 and 5 2 methodology 2 1 study area the sanjiang plain 43 49 55 48 27 40 n 129 11 20 135 05 26 e is a vast area with low relief and is located in northeast china fig 1 it is one of largest commodity crops areas in northeast china and has a total area of 108 900 km2 annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 600 mm the annual average temperature is 1 9 c and the climate is humid and mid humid continental approximately six months out of the year have a temperature lower than 0 c chen et al 2013 bawujiu farm fig 1 47 18 47 50 n 133 50 134 33 e is located in the northeastern part of the sanjiang plain and was selected as the study area this farm is located in a typical seasonal frozen region and has been developed as a national farm by intensive agricultural activities for more than 60 years frozen events in the region influence soil moisture and thus crop growth in the subsequent year the major land use types are cultivated land forest land grassland and wetland two automatic meteorological stations s1 and s2 fig 1 located in the center and in the south of this farm respectively were established to collect soil moisture data 2 2 methods a comparative analysis method was designed fig 2 to answer two questions 1 can each of the three methods microwave remote sensing ecohydrological model and in situ monitoring capture top soil moisture information in the sanjiang plain 2 which method is the most accurate method for obtaining the information the smap soil moisture product was selected to represent the microwave remote sensing method as it is the most recent microwave soil moisture product and has been used worldwide liu et al 2017 cui et al 2017 the rs dtvgm model liu et al 2009 cai et al 2017 was chosen to represent the ecohydrological model because it is a physical model based on the water cycle and is driven by remote sensing data having better spatial resolution than the smap product in situ monitoring data from two automatic meteorological stations were established to collect direct soil moisture data in this study two complete freeze thaw cycles 642 days were divided into three frozen ft periods and two non frozen nft periods based on the 0 c air temperature each ft period began when the air temperature fell below 0 c and each nft period began when the temperature rose above 0 c soil moisture variation in the frozen area was compared and analyzed at different spatial scales 9 km 1 km and point by the three methods fig 2 2 2 1 smap soil moisture product the smap mission is the latest l band constellation dedicated to providing global scale soil moisture and frozen state data entekhabi et al 2014 the smap was launched on january 31 2015 and placed into a polar sun synchronous orbit with local overpass times of 6 00 am descending and 6 00 pm ascending the smap instrument incorporates an l band radiometer 1 41 ghz that includes a single feed horn parabolic mesh reflector and an l band radar 1 26 and 1 29 ghz cui et al 2017 the smap can provide soil moisture estimates for the top 5 cm of soil with a 0 04 cm3 cm3 volumetric soil moisture retrieval accuracy at a temporal resolution of 1 3 days entekhabi et al 2014 despite the failure of the smap radar on july 7 2015 the l band radiometer continued to operate as planned and has provided routine data since march 31 2015 smap soil moisture data from november 2015 are available at the nasa national snow and ice data center distributed active archive center nsidc daac http nsidc org data smap smap data

calculated independently by the nasa goddard earth observing system model version 5 geos 5 the derived emissivity was corrected by incorporating vegetation and surface roughness data and the dielectric constant was determined using the fresnel equation finally the soil moisture was calculated using a dielectric mixing model o neill et al 2016 the smap enhanced l3 radiometer global daily soil moisture products version 2 0 spl3smp e were resampled to a global cylindrical 9 km equal area scalable earth grid in this study the soil moisture retrieval am and pm data from the smap were used and averaged due to a strong diurnal variability in soil moisture for freeze thaw conditions in the fall and spring in the processing of the smap data matlab version 2016a was used to read the original files and select pixels within which the two auto meteorological stations were located then the soil moisture values of the pixels were extracted 2 2 2 rs dtvgm model 2 2 2 1 model

bawujiu farm to collect soil moisture data at different locations and depths in this research we used the in situ monitoring soil moisture data at a soil depth of 10 cm s1 a hobo usa automated meteorological station was set up in 2014 at the center of the farm the s1 sensors s smc m005 usa operating temperature range of 40 to 60 c 3 vol for 0 50 vol were inserted into three soil layers at depths of 10 cm 60 cm and 90 cm the land use type for this location was paddy land s2 a zeno usa automated meteorological station was erected in 2010 at the southern part of the farm the s2 sensors tdr type usa operating temperature range of 20 to 50 c 1 vol for 0 40 vol 2 vol for 40 70 vol were inserted into four soil layers at depths of 10 cm 30 cm 50 cm and 90 cm the land use type at this site was dry land the soil moisture data sampling frequency for s1 and s2 was 15 min per sample and there were 96 samples collected each day high data sampling frequency helped to overcome the difficulty of strongly diurnal variability of soil moisture in the frozen area the in situ monitoring data 61 632 samples were processed at a daily timescale using the interactive data language idl with the mean algorithm to match the temporal scale of the smap product and model calculation results in this study the average s1 and s2 soil moisture values were used to reduce system errors from the sensor sampling 2 2 4 data analysis and evaluation by using the triple collocation method in this study three data sets that included in situ monitoring data smap data and model simulation were compared using the triple collocation method the three data sets were independent of each other the additive random errors for each data can be calculated and analyzed as well the tc method has been used widely in oceanography to estimate measurements errors for sea surface temperature it has also been used in hydrology to estimate errors in precipitation measurements and particular soil moisture measurements the specific steps and functions are represented in table 2 at the same time the pearson correlation and determination coefficients were used to analyze variation in soil moisture from these three methods 3 results 3 1 performance of the three data sets in the frozen area 3 1 1 smap soil moisture product the smap soil moisture simulation captured variations in soil moisture during a complete freeze thaw cycle but more soil moisture information was presented during the nft period 428 days than in the ft period 214 days fig 3 soil moisture was as high as 0 49 m3 m3 from mid april to mid july progressively increased from the beginning of march to mid april and then decreased to 0 05 m3 m3 from the mid july to the end of october the soil moisture content was lower during the ft period because the air temperature was lower than 0 c after the ft period when air temperature was higher the soil moisture content increased because of snowmelt on the land surface the amount of valid soil moisture data for the smap product influences its ability to measure variations in soil water content in a frozen area over a long time period smap captured valid soil information for only 304 of 642 days which amounted to only 47 4 of the total time period fig 3a the reason for this limitation was the smap satellite had a three day revisiting period which created a data gap when using this data set in this area during the ft period there were 58 soil moisture data in the three ft periods 214 days accounting for 27 1 of the entire period during the nft period there were 246 soil moisture data during the two nft periods 428 days which represented 57 5 of this period 3 1 2 rs dtvgm model the remote sensing driven model captured more variation in soil moisture in the frozen area and provided more data during both the nft and ft periods fig 4 the model simulated results which displayed higher soil water content during the nft period than in the ft period showed that the high soil water period extended from the end of april to the end of october for each year the results of the model showed variations in soil moisture variation for one freeze thaw cycle there were 642 data points during the research period meaning that soil moisture data were simulated for each day the data distribution from the simulated output was dispersed especially during the nft period 3 1 3 in situ monitoring the in situ monitoring data performed better in displaying soil moisture variations than the smap product or the remote sensing model fig 5 generally in situ monitoring data are continuous stable and accurately respond to the external environmental conditions whether during the ft or the nft period the in situ monitoring method obtained soil moisture information in the freeze thaw area each day throughout the research period there were 642 data points from the in situ monitoring stations and in situ monitoring was able to capture continuous variations in the soil water content at the same time the monitoring data reflected variations in precipitation which had a direct impact on soil moisture fig 5 this indicated that the in situ monitoring method is sensitive to meteorological conditions especially precipitation 3 2 tc results for the three methods by using the tc method the rmse for the three data sets during the ft and nft periods were calculated table 3 for each data set smap had the smallest rmse the rmse of the in situ measurements smap data and model simulation were 0 05 0 03 and 0 08 respectively during the ft period the smap data had the highest accuracy the rmse of the in situ measurements smap data and model simulation were 0 06 0 04 and 0 09 respectively during the nft period in situ measure data has the highest accuracy and the rmse was 0 01 the rmse was 0 02 and 0 02 for the smap data and model simulation respectively from the table we found that all the three soil moisture sets had a higher data accuracy during the nft period relative to the ft period 3 3 smap vs in situ monitoring soil moisture data from the smap product were compared with the in situ monitoring data using the pearson correlation method fig 6 the correlation between the two methods was weak there were 210 smap data points available for comparison with the in situ monitoring data the pearson correlation coefficient was 0 301 and the standard error was 0 036 m3 m3 the smap soil moisture average value was 0 364 m3 m3 which was larger than the value of 0 278 m3 m3 from the in situ monitoring method the data range from the smap product was 0 030 m3 m3 0 490 m3 m which was smaller than the range of 0 047 m3 m3 0 694 m3 m3 for the in situ monitoring method detailed statistical and comparative analyses for the two methods were also developed table 4 during the ft period there were only 58 data points from the smap product but 234 data points from the in situ monitoring method the smap data mean value during the ft period was 0 160 m3 m3 which was lower than the mean value of 0 175 m3 m3 from the in situ monitoring data the standard deviation for smap dataset was 0 054 m3 m3 and the standard deviation for the in situ monitoring dataset was 0 077 m3 m3 the pearson correlation coefficient for the two soil moisture datasets was 0 301 during the nft period there were more data in both datasets the mean value of the smap data was 0 373 m3 m3 and the standard deviation was 0 129 m3 m3 the mean value for the in situ monitoring data set was 0 338 m3 m3 and was smaller than the mean value for the smap dataset the standard deviation was 0 094 m3 m3 the pearson correlation coefficient was 0 557 during the nft period which was larger than during the ft period 3 4 ecohydrological model simulation vs in situ monitoring the simulation results from the rs dtvgm model were also compared with the in situ monitoring data fig 7 each of the two datasets included 642 data points the pearson correlation coefficient for the datasets was 0 530 this result indicated that these two soil moisture datasets have a stronger correlation relative to the smap data and in situ monitoring data the in situ monitoring data ranged from 0 047 m3 m3 to 0 694 m3 m3 and this range was greater than the model range of 0 014 m3 m3 to 0 314 m3 m3 the mean value for the rs dtvgm model results was 0 126 m3 m3 which was smaller than the mean value of 0 278 m3 m3 from the in situ monitoring data the two datasets from the rs dtvgm and the in situ monitoring were also compared and analyzed table 5 during the ft period there were 234 data points in each dataset the mean value of the rs dtvgm simulation result was 0 085 m3 m3 and the mean value for the in situ monitoring was 0 175 m3 m3 the standard deviations of the model and in situ monitoring results were 0 070 and 0 077 respectively the pearson correlation coefficient for the two datasets was 0 010 indicating a weak correlation between the two datasets during the nft period the two datasets showed a stronger correlation than during the ft period with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 726 the mean value for the model simulation result was 0 149 m3 m3 and the mean value from the in situ monitoring was 0 338 m3 m3 the standard deviation for the model simulation was 0 046 and the standard deviation from the in situ monitoring was 0 094 3 5 smap vs rs dtvgm model in the spatial the cumulative spatial distribution of soil moisture data from smap and model simulation during the two periods are shown in fig 8 heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of the two data sets could be detected however the spatial resolution of the smap and model simulation results were significantly different here soil moisture data during 642 continuous days were added because the smap satellite had a three day revisiting period this created a data gap when comparing the spatial distribution of soil moisture from the two methods during the ft period smap production had a high soil moisture content in the east and south of the sanjiang plain model simulations indicated a high soil moisture level in the east and north middle of the plain the two data sets displayed similar spatial distributions during the ft period during the nft period the high soil moisture areas were located in the west and middle according to the smap production similar to the smap the model simulation results also showed high soil moisture areas in the middle of the plain there were significant edge effect from the model results in the north and east because the two boundaries are two rivers in summary the two data sets had a heterogeneous spatial distribution during the ft and nft period but model results displayed more spatial details of soil moisture due to their fine spatial resolution 4 discussion 4 1 limitations of smap soil moisture information in the frozen area the ability of smap to provide soil moisture information was hindered by the limited number of valid data points and data accuracy especially during the ft period in this study there were 58 data points during the three ft periods and 201 data points during the two nft periods accounting for 27 1 and 57 5 during each period respectively the pearson correlation coefficient for the smap product and the in situ monitoring dataset was 0 113 during the ft period and 0 546 during the nft period at the same time total mean soil moisture during the nft period 5 cm depth from the smap production was higher than the in situ monitoring data 10 cm depth table 4 this may have been the result of the vegetation correction used in the smap production in this area and its influence on the final data accuracy in this study area rice was the vegetation type of the underlying surface and it was difficult for the smap production to identify such detailed land cover information in fact vegetation correction and roughness were the important factors affecting the passive microwave remote sensing abilities for soil moisture jackson 1993 the low number of valid data points and the weak correlation between smap and the in situ monitoring data indicated that smap was not able to accurately measure soil moisture in this middle high latitude frozen area plant growth and snow cover are the two factors influencing the data accuracy of smap during the nft period microwave remote sensing e g smap was rarely influenced by the meteorological condition e g precipitation mist cloud due to the strong penetrability of the long band length of microwaves ulaby et al 1982 entekhabi et al 2004 however plant growth and litter from crop harvests can directly influence data accuracy moran et al 2002 bushy plants hinder microwaves at the soil surface thus making it more difficult to capture the detailed soil information received by the sensor hallikainen et al 1985 in our research area the land surface was covered by crops during the nft period resulting in fewer valid data points for smap during the ft period snow cover in the freeze thaw area was the main reason for loss of soil information from smap the smap soil product was retrieved using l band passive microwave radiometer but thick snow cover sheltered the soil moisture signal njoku et al 2003 kim et al 2011 in this area the average snow thickness in a year can reach 30 50 cm chen et al 2013 leading to significant decline in soil moisture accuracy 4 2 advantages and difficulties of using the rs dtvgm to obtain soil moisture measurements in the frozen area for the number of data and the correlation with in situ measurements performance of the rs dtvgm model was greater than the performance of the smap soil moisture product there were 642 data points collected during the entire research period and the pearson correlation coefficient during the nft period reached 0 726 however the rs dtvgm performance was not satisfactory during the ft period a significant advantage of the model is that it can present continuous soil moisture data and predict soil moisture variations for different scenarios arya and paris 1981 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 by using the remote sensing driven model researchers can obtain raster soil moisture data at various spatial scales easton et al 2008 cai et al 2017 although the model showed fair performance in obtaining soil moisture data during the nft period it had two problems in the simulation process in the frozen areas first during the ft period the results simulated by the model were not sufficiently accurate as supported by the pearson correlation coefficient this occurred because the phase transition during the frozen period was too complex for the mathematical functions to accurately describe variations in soil moisture edwards and cresser 1992 viterbo et al 1999 kværnø and øygarden 2006 second in seasonal frozen areas the freeze thaw process occurred very frequently there may be 3 5 freeze thaw cycles in one day frauenfeld et al 2004 chen et al 2013 consequently the soil moisture content changed frequently with each freeze thaw cycle li et al 2000 hansson et al 2004 unfortunately the model s temporal scale was one day so the model was not able to capture the real soil moisture variation during the freeze thaw cycles 4 3 role of in situ monitoring in capturing real soil information in the frozen area in the future in this study the in situ monitoring data represented real soil moisture variations in the frozen area and validated the smap product and the model simulation results although the in situ monitoring data performed well at presenting soil moisture data for this area this method cannot play a leading role in obtaining and supplying soil moisture data at large spatial scales e g regional scale watershed scale in the future three reasons for the limited application of in situ monitoring data include the high cost of monitoring the discontinuous stations across a research area and the sensor limitation in frozen conditions in this study the average cost for each small auto meteorological station exceeded 5 000 and the harsh natural conditions increased the costs of operation and maintenance the application of these data is also limited by the inherent discontinuous spatial distribution of the data especially for single in situ monitoring stations like those used in this study lastly volumetric soil moisture was obtained using the sensor however it is easier to capture the liquid soil water than all the water in the soil especially in the frozen condition this is because the in situ measurement rarely considers the soil bulk density in different areas and this will influence the data accuracy and reliability 4 4 scale entanglement of multi source soil moisture data in the frozen area scale entanglement samaniego et al 2010 kumar et al 2013 is an unavoidable issue when comparing multi sources data in the frozen area in this research the smap soil moisture product model calculation results and in situ monitoring data had spatial scales of 9 km 1 km and point respectively when the three datasets were compared the spatial scale differences of these three datasets produced some uncertainties in this study area the land surface is very homogenous but the coarse spatial resolution of the smap data resulted in mixed end member issues fisher et al 2006 tang et al 2010 nijland et al 2016 and influenced the data accuracy as well the analysis results despite the existing scale entanglements this research still revealed and compared the performance of the three methods for capturing soil moisture in the frozen area successfully 5 conclusion in this study the performance of three methods microwave remote sensing smap product remote sensing driven model rs dtvgm and in situ monitoring were compared and analyzed for capturing soil moisture information in the sanjiang plain the entire research period was divided into three ft periods and two nft periods and the supply rates of valid data and the accuracy of the data of the three methods were calculated and compared using the triple collocation method the results showed that the rmses of the three data sets were 0 03 0 08 and 0 05 the valid data supply rates of the smap product in the ft and nft periods were 27 1 and 57 5 respectively the pearson correlation coefficient between the smap product and the in situ monitoring dataset was 0 301 during the ft period and 0 557 during the nft period the rs dtvgm model had a data supply rate of 100 the pearson correlation coefficient for this model was 0 101 during the ft period but the value reached 0 726 during the nft period for the three soil moisture data sets the accuracy ranking in this middle high latitude area was smap in situ monitoring model simulation however neither the smap nor the rs dtvgm model could capture the real soil moisture information during the ft period and the results from rs dtvgm were closer to in situ measurements during the nft period than the smap method the in situ method can supply accurate soil moisture data but its role is limited by the high cost and discontinuous distribution of stations single in situ soil moisture stations used in this research should be combined with the international soil moisture network in future research in the future the data from the three methods should be assimilated together to achieve soil moisture data with a higher accuracy spatial and temporal resolution in this important area acknowledgements the authors thank the administrators in the bawujiu farm and national natural
