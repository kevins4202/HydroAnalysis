8710,to date various simulation and optimization models have been proposed for optimum design of the reservoirs and the downstream irrigation network systems in most of these models the minimum reservoir capacity is defined as the objective function that can supply the defined agricultural demands based on a predetermined assumed reliability level however the objective functions of minimizing the reservoir capacity may not find the optimum solution economically in this study an optimization model for design of a reservoir and the irrigation network is developed with the objective function of maximizing the net benefit gained from the system the results are presented for two operation policies of s type and sq type which are common linear decision rules ldr for the reservoirs chance constrained cc stochastic optimization with linear decision rules ldrs are presented in this study the discussed model which is a deterministic explicit optimization model for a single reservoir and the downstream irrigation network is applied for the marboreh dam in iran with the aim of extraction of the optimum reliability level for supplying the agricultural demands results indicate that the optimum reliability level is about 50 for the s type and sq type rules in the case studied keywords optimum reliability reservoir capacity explicit method operation policy economic approach 1 introduction in the design of reservoirs and downstream irrigation networks economic objectives are very important because of the high construction costs the optimization models for design of the dams and networks become complicated because of uncertain nature of the effective factors on the optimum reservoir capacity and the irrigation network area generally three factors affect the reservoir capacity the network area and the operation of the system these factors include uncertain inputs amount of supply for the demands or the reliability level and the reservoir operation policy inflow to the reservoir is one of the most important uncertain inputs which is influenced by hydro climatic condition the uncertainty could be analyzed in two general methods in the first method that is known as the implicit analysis method time series of the uncertain data are used 1 11 in the second method known as the explicit analysis method the statistical characteristics of the data such as the distribution function mean and standard deviation are used in the equations instead of the data 10 12 15 in the explicit method the analytical equations are more complex than the implicit method however the number of equations that are solved simultaneously is decreased in special cases nonlinear equations convert to simpler linear equations in the explicit method the explicit method is the primary focus of this study the approach for optimizing the dam and network is important in both implicit and explicit methods this approach is related to the reliability of satisfying meeting demands in general there are two main approaches for optimizing the reservoir capacity and agricultural network area one approach is based on minimizing the reservoir capacity which may be a non economic approach in this approach the objective function is minimizing the reservoir capacity based on the assumed reliability levels the ease with which this problem may be solved is the advantage of this method compared to models that consider economic parameters on the other hand the lack of consideration of economic indicators is the weakness of this solution method 10 in the second approach economic indicators are considered and the objective function is to maximize the net benefit 4 7 and 16 the net benefit is obtained from total sales revenue of network products minus total costs including the cost of construction operation and maintenance of the dam and irrigation network there are many forms of solving the model in this approach which can be categorized into a range of incomplete and complete forms in this part of the paper two types of these forms are discussed in the first form the objective function is the net benefit where the benefit includes the income of the network and the costs include the cost of the dam and the network but in the constraints of the optimization model the reliability is assumed for supplying the demands for the assumption of reliability in this form of solution method different numbers have been considered in different studies these values are not necessarily optimal numbers and the exact basis for assuming these values have not been provided however these assumed numbers strongly affect the final answer 16 in this form the assumed reliability impacts reservoir capacity which selected for each network area in the other form of this approach reliability is not represented by a fixed value and the benefit from the network varies according to the percentage of supplying the water for the demands in this form the crop yield function is used which represents the production of crop based on the supplied water demand 4 16 this function adds to the complexity of the problem in this form the optimum reliability and allowed deficit threshold in supplying the demands can be extracted these values can be extracted for different climates and can be used in simple methods first approach and the first form of the second approach and more accurate results can be derived this form second form of the second approach is the issue of present study the operation policy will also affect the results which will be addressed in the current study the present research is conducted for two linear policies s type and sq type s type and sq type are the linear decision rules ldrs chance constrained cc optimization model with linear decision rules is the subject of this study the developed cc optimization model with linear decision rules is provided the explicit method which is used in the present study was introduced in the 70 s and initially was started with the provision of the s type linear decision rule further studies developed a more optimal linear operation policy which was the sq type decision rule or other similar forms such as multi sq type decision rules 17 22 initial and recent studies for the explicit method were based on minimizing the reservoir capacity with assumed reliability and in recent years this method of solving for optimizing the dam and its network systems has not been fully completed but for the implicit method that is based on the use of time series significant progress has been made and complete models have been proposed in the present study the explicit method with an objective function of the net benefit is presented also recent explicit method studies focused on seasonal reliability however average reliability were not considered both the seasonal and average reliability are discussed in this study based on the above mentioned points three important subjects will affect the design of an optimum reservoir the first issue is the uncertainty of probabilistic parameters 1 23 this issue is seen by two explicit and implicit methods the second issue is the reliability and accepted deficit threshold of supplying the demands 11 24 the third issue is the operation policy 3 in the current research three mentioned issues affecting the optimum capacity of a reservoir are considered and discussed and a stochastic optimization economic model for design of a reservoir and the downstream irrigation network is presented through an explicit method in this research a new explicit approach for design of a dam and network is presented which considers the crop yield function this solution is presented for s type and sq type linear operation policies which can be developed in nonlinear policies for future research the focus of this study is on the extraction of results regarding the optimum reliability and optimum accepted deficit threshold of supplying water for the demands because these values have significant effects on the results of the simple models the effect of the assumed reliability parameter on the results has been studied in previous research 11 however there is a gap in science regarding optimum reliability and how to extract it through the explicit method 2 case study the case study is the marboreh dam located in the lorestan province iran on the marboreh river and is about 9 km south east of the doroud city the dam river basin area is 2536 km2 the layout and hydrographic map of the study area are presented in fig 1 the hydro climatologic agronomic and economic data of the case study are extracted from the hydrology meteorological agricultural and economic reports of the marboreh dam and the irrigation network plan that has been studied by pars ray ab consulting engineers 25 28 the inflow into the reservoir is the only uncertain parameter of the optimization model s input data while other inputs of the model are considered as the certain parameters the decision variables are the reservoir capacity the irrigation network area and the reliability level of supplying water for the agricultural demands statistical characteristics including the mean inflow in various months are used for the explicit model table 1 shows the statistical characteristics of the inflow at the site of the marboreh dam the agricultural demands of the network and evaporation from free water surface of marboreh dam are presented in table 2 the cropping pattern of the irrigation network along with the economic and agronomic parameters of the crops are presented in table 3 the surface sprinkler and micro irrigation efficiency are considered 55 75 and 95 in the mathematical model respectively the water demand per hectare is calculated according to the percentage of the cropping pattern and water demand of each crop in each month the potential crop yield and the net benefit of crop sales are in fact two non deterministic parameters but in the present study they are considered deterministic parameters therefore for the whole period of operation 50 years the average values estimated for them are used 3 methodology and governing equations in this section the equations and constraints for the optimum design of a reservoir capacity and the downstream irrigation network area are presented with respect to the uncertainty of the inflow and for linear operation policies with the explicit method the objective function is maximizing the net benefit gained from the system at first the equations of the chance constraint stochastic programming are presented and then a deterministic equivalent model is defined 3 1 mathematical programming for the stochastic optimum design of a reservoir capacity and the downstream irrigation network area based on economic indicators with explicit method the equations and constraints governing the optimum design of a reservoir capacity and the downstream irrigation network area are presented as follows the net benefit is defined in the year zero which is the beginning year of the system operation in the following equations pv means the

cost of the dam and network these values are 625 000 15000 000 and 7500 dollars in this study respectively a linear regression method was used to calculate the construction cost of the dam in this equation b is the y intercept and a is the slope of the line by using this linear equation it is possible to estimate the construction cost of the dam for any capacity this regression was extracted from the economic studies report of marboreh dam 28 the y intercept of this equation is associated with the dead volume of the reservoir that is filled by sediment and the active volume of the reservoir is in the upper level of the dead volume the estimated construction cost of the irrigation network is represented by the multiplying a coefficient c into the network area economic studies of the irrigation network were used to determine the coefficient c 28 the percentages of cost of various stages for dam and the irrigation network are presented in the supplementary data no 1 m is the

k ycn is extracted from local studies 34 and fao guideline no 33 and 56 31 35 as shown in equation 11 similar deficit irrigation is applied for crops and if the reservoir is not able to fully supply the water demand the deficit irrigation will be equal for all crops this approach represents the water allocation policy and irrigation strategy of this study deficit irrigation occurs when crop yield is reduced due to receiving less water the main objective of the deficit irrigation is to increase the economic efficiency of water use equations 17 23 are related to the average and seasonal

following the deterministic equivalent of the stochastic optimization model is presented in two s type and sq type linear operation policies for the explicit method 3 2 the deterministic equivalent of the stochastic optimization model in s type operation policy the deterministic equivalent of the stochastic optimum design of the reservoir and network is different for s type and sq type operation policies in both linear policies of s type and sq type the reservoir balance equation is omitted from the constraints as follows the governing equation to release water according to the s type operation policy is given in equation 23 23 r m s m b m s type ldr b m is an unknown constant for month m which should be optimized in the model in this policy by combining the balance equation equation 7 and the s type policy equation relations 24 and 25 are obtained for the release volume r m and the storage volume s m of the reservoir in each month the y index which is related to the year has been eliminated from parameters r q and s and relations 24 and 25 are valid over all years 24 r m q m 1 b m 1 b m 25 s m q m 1 b m 1 equation 15 can be presented as equation 26 in this equation if

equation 11 r cm dt cm r m dt m is considered and the relation r cm r m dt m dt cm is provided thus by calculation of e min 1 r m dt m and multiplying into dt cm e min dt cm r cm is also computed in the following the method to calculate e min 1 r m dt m is explained finally by using equations 24 and 25 the deterministic equivalent of equation 15 is calculated for the parameter e y ac as well as the deterministic equivalent of the reliability constraints equation 17 to 22 in the stochastic programming model it is assumed that the probability distribution function of the monthly inflow follows

irrigation network area and reservoir capacity changes in the net benefit other economic parameters and the optimum supply of network water demands are presented for various network areas and reservoir capacities the network area parameter and reservoir capacity are entered as a known and discrete parameter into the model the discrete values of the reservoir capacity are selected to cover a wide range of values moreover for any irrigation network area the range of the optimum reservoir capacities are specified for both operation policies by trial and error the results are presented for several reservoir capacities below and above the optimum range in order to determine how the net benefit changes the same reservoir capacities are considered for both operation policies in order to make a better comparison the results of the model show that in the s type policy a reservoir capacity of 150 million cubic meters is feasible and optimum therefore for the s type operation policy which essentially needs large capacities two capacities that are greater than 150 million cubic meters were included for the discrete amount of reservoir capacities in the sq type policy with increasing reservoir capacity of more than 60 million cubic meters the net benefit decreases sharply therefore the reservoir capacity of 60 and one capacity less than it are included for discrete amounts of reservoir capacity since the results should be compared for two operation policies under the same condition of reservoir capacity the values of 30 60 120 150 200 and 250 million cubic meters are considered for the reservoir capacity also if the capacity interval was considered equal the tables would be too lengthy the optimization model is defined in the lingo 16 software and the results are extracted in tables 4 and 5 the results are presented in two s type and sq type operating policies respectively the optimum reservoir capacity and other economic parameters for each network area are highlighted in these tables supplying the irrigation networks demands in each case is presented with two average and seasonal reliability parameters it should be noted that by considering equations 17 29 and 36 for s type policy and equations 17 51 and 58 for sq type policy the average reliability in tables 4 and 5 is the average of the parameter m the m is equal to the probability of fully supplying the demands in each month and is seasonal reliability accepted seasonal reliability is presented and is the minimum of m in all months accepted seasonal reliability is the minimum percentage of supplying the demand that is obtained in all months as shown in table 4 the reservoir s optimum capacity is constant in different areas of the network in this operation policy a low reservoir capacity is not even capable to provide the low demands and for a wide range of demands a high capacity is required the low reservoir capacities are not profitable in this policy and the output of the model is unfeasible in s type operation policy for low reservoir capacities this means that the model is not able to provide a linear relationship for the water release from the reservoir in the form of s type rule because the water release is dependent only on the reservoir storage sm and reservoir storage is zero in some months but this occurs rarely in high reservoir capacities in the sq type operation policy water release is dependent on the reservoir storage sm and the inflow into the reservoir qm causing the model to escape from the unfeasible status in the previous studies the answers of the s type operation policy are also unfeasible in some of the assumed reliabilities and cases 11 18 21 the objective function of the mentioned studies is minimizing the reservoir capacity while the reliabilities of supplying the demands are assumed in the model constraints the high reservoir capacity for the s type operation policy in comparison with other operation policies in the previous studies 11 17 21 indicates the non economic nature of this policy which is evident in this study the absence of economic indicators in the objective function and model constraints as well as the lack of discussion on the optimum reliability of supplying the demand in the explicit method are the limitations of previous studies the optimum reservoir capacity in the s type operation policy for low areas of the network is so high and by increasing the network area the same reservoir capacity is optimum as the network area increases the reliability of supply is reduced generally the net benefit in the network area of 20 000 hectares and the reservoir capacity of 150 million cubic meters is optimum the optimum average reliability is 52 4 in this operation policy increasing the reservoir capacity does not significantly increase the reliability of supply therefore for various areas of the network the first capacity that can be operated is optimum due to its low cost the accepted seasonal reliability is the minimum reliability of supplying the demands in various months of the year 12 months for the large networks this value is zero it means in some months no water was supplied for the smaller network this value can be greater than zero accepted seasonal reliability may be the same for a network area at various reservoir capacities this means that increasing the reservoir capacity increases the average reliability or average of m but the minimum of m is constant there is no clear trend for accepted seasonal reliability in a specific network area at various reservoir capacities for large areas of the network accepted seasonal reliability is set to zero generally the results of the sq type operation policy are presented in table 5 the net benefit for the same area of the network and the reservoir capacity is higher than the s type case in this operation policy the network area of 25 000 hectares is optimum and the reservoir capacity of 60 mcm results the highest net benefit the optimum reliability for sq type operation policy is 50 1 in both policies optimum accepted seasonal reliability is zero this shows that during the optimum supply of the demand the percentage of supply becomes zero and there are no supply in some months in fig 2 changes in net benefit and in fig 3 changes in the reliability versus the reservoir capacity with the network area of 25 000 hectares are presented as shown in figs 2 and 3 the net benefit and reliability for the sq type policy are higher than the s type policy in fig 4 changes in the optimum net benefit and in fig 5 changes in optimum reliability versus the network area are presented also in fig 6 changes in the benefit cost ratio versus the network are shown in both operation policies the results indicate that the sq type operation policy is more economical than the s type policy where with the s type operation policy a higher capacity for the reservoir is needed which leads to a lower net benefit with the same network area for two operation policies the net benefit for the sq type operation policy is higher than the s type policy the optimum reliability level is about 50 for both s type and sq type rules this optimum reliability can be used for simpler models that are not based on an economic objective function and for models with an assumed reliability parameter 5 conclusion in this research a stochastic optimization model for design of reservoir and the downstream irrigation network with economic objective function is presented using the explicit method the results are presented for two s type and sq type linear decision rules although the current study is presented for two common operation policies this method can be used for solving similar optimization problems with other operation policies like multiple sq type also this method can be used as a guide for inflow data with a different statistical distribution such as normal distribution which is more complex in addition the developed model in this study can be used in various climates with various hydro climatological conditions from the results of these supplementary studies the optimum reliability and optimum accepted deficit threshold can be provided for various climates these values can be used in simpler models that are based on assumed reliability as well as for accepted deficit thresholds where their objective functions are not economic the emphasis on extracting the optimum reliability level is due to this fact that in simple models the crop yield equation and its relationship with other constraints are generally ignored and the reliability for supply is pre assumed and the optimum network area and reservoir capacity are determined with these assumptions these assumptions can affect significantly on moving away the obtained answer from the real optimum solution appendix a supplementary data the following is the

8710,to date various simulation and optimization models have been proposed for optimum design of the reservoirs and the downstream irrigation network systems in most of these models the minimum reservoir capacity is defined as the objective function that can supply the defined agricultural demands based on a predetermined assumed reliability level however the objective functions of minimizing the reservoir capacity may not find the optimum solution economically in this study an optimization model for design of a reservoir and the irrigation network is developed with the objective function of maximizing the net benefit gained from the system the results are presented for two operation policies of s type and sq type which are common linear decision rules ldr for the reservoirs chance constrained cc stochastic optimization with linear decision rules ldrs are presented in this study the discussed model which is a deterministic explicit optimization model for a single reservoir and the downstream irrigation network is applied for the marboreh dam in iran with the aim of extraction of the optimum reliability level for supplying the agricultural demands results indicate that the optimum reliability level is about 50 for the s type and sq type rules in the case studied keywords optimum reliability reservoir capacity explicit method operation policy economic approach 1 introduction in the design of reservoirs and downstream irrigation networks economic objectives are very important because of the high construction costs the optimization models for design of the dams and networks become complicated because of uncertain nature of the effective factors on the optimum reservoir capacity and the irrigation network area generally three factors affect the reservoir capacity the network area and the operation of the system these factors include uncertain inputs amount of supply for the demands or the reliability level and the reservoir operation policy inflow to the reservoir is one of the most important uncertain inputs which is influenced by hydro climatic condition the uncertainty could be analyzed in two general methods in the first method that is known as the implicit analysis method time series of the uncertain data are used 1 11 in the second method known as the explicit analysis method the statistical characteristics of the data such as the distribution function mean and standard deviation are used in the equations instead of the data 10 12 15 in the explicit method the analytical equations are more complex than the implicit method however the number of equations that are solved simultaneously is decreased in special cases nonlinear equations convert to simpler linear equations in the explicit method the explicit method is the primary focus of this study the approach for optimizing the dam and network is important in both implicit and explicit methods this approach is related to the reliability of satisfying meeting demands in general there are two main approaches for optimizing the reservoir capacity and agricultural network area one approach is based on minimizing the reservoir capacity which may be a non economic approach in this approach the objective function is minimizing the reservoir capacity based on the assumed reliability levels the ease with which this problem may be solved is the advantage of this method compared to models that consider economic parameters on the other hand the lack of consideration of economic indicators is the weakness of this solution method 10 in the second approach economic indicators are considered and the objective function is to maximize the net benefit 4 7 and 16 the net benefit is obtained from total sales revenue of network products minus total costs including the cost of construction operation and maintenance of the dam and irrigation network there are many forms of solving the model in this approach which can be categorized into a range of incomplete and complete forms in this part of the paper two types of these forms are discussed in the first form the objective function is the net benefit where the benefit includes the income of the network and the costs include the cost of the dam and the network but in the constraints of the optimization model the reliability is assumed for supplying the demands for the assumption of reliability in this form of solution method different numbers have been considered in different studies these values are not necessarily optimal numbers and the exact basis for assuming these values have not been provided however these assumed numbers strongly affect the final answer 16 in this form the assumed reliability impacts reservoir capacity which selected for each network area in the other form of this approach reliability is not represented by a fixed value and the benefit from the network varies according to the percentage of supplying the water for the demands in this form the crop yield function is used which represents the production of crop based on the supplied water demand 4 16 this function adds to the complexity of the problem in this form the optimum reliability and allowed deficit threshold in supplying the demands can be extracted these values can be extracted for different climates and can be used in simple methods first approach and the first form of the second approach and more accurate results can be derived this form second form of the second approach is the issue of present study the operation policy will also affect the results which will be addressed in the current study the present research is conducted for two linear policies s type and sq type s type and sq type are the linear decision rules ldrs chance constrained cc optimization model with linear decision rules is the subject of this study the developed cc optimization model with linear decision rules is provided the explicit method which is used in the present study was introduced in the 70 s and initially was started with the provision of the s type linear decision rule further studies developed a more optimal linear operation policy which was the sq type decision rule or other similar forms such as multi sq type decision rules 17 22 initial and recent studies for the explicit method were based on minimizing the reservoir capacity with assumed reliability and in recent years this method of solving for optimizing the dam and its network systems has not been fully completed but for the implicit method that is based on the use of time series significant progress has been made and complete models have been proposed in the present study the explicit method with an objective function of the net benefit is presented also recent explicit method studies focused on seasonal reliability however average reliability were not considered both the seasonal and average reliability are discussed in this study based on the above mentioned points three important subjects will affect the design of an optimum reservoir the first issue is the uncertainty of probabilistic parameters 1 23 this issue is seen by two explicit and implicit methods the second issue is the reliability and accepted deficit threshold of supplying the demands 11 24 the third issue is the operation policy 3 in the current research three mentioned issues affecting the optimum capacity of a reservoir are considered and discussed and a stochastic optimization economic model for design of a reservoir and the downstream irrigation network is presented through an explicit method in this research a new explicit approach for design of a dam and network is presented which considers the crop yield function this solution is presented for s type and sq type linear operation policies which can be developed in nonlinear policies for future research the focus of this study is on the extraction of results regarding the optimum reliability and optimum accepted deficit threshold of supplying water for the demands because these values have significant effects on the results of the simple models the effect of the assumed reliability parameter on the results has been studied in previous research 11 however there is a gap in science regarding optimum reliability and how to extract it through the explicit method 2 case study the case study is the marboreh dam located in the lorestan province iran on the marboreh river and is about 9 km south east of the doroud city the dam river basin area is 2536 km2 the layout and hydrographic map of the study area are presented in fig 1 the hydro climatologic agronomic and economic data of the case study are extracted from the hydrology meteorological agricultural and economic reports of the marboreh dam and the irrigation network plan that has been studied by pars ray ab consulting engineers 25 28 the inflow into the reservoir is the only uncertain parameter of the optimization model s input data while other inputs of the model are considered as the certain parameters the decision variables are the reservoir capacity the irrigation network area and the reliability level of supplying water for the agricultural demands statistical characteristics including the mean inflow in various months are used for the explicit model table 1 shows the statistical characteristics of the inflow at the site of the marboreh dam the agricultural demands of the network and evaporation from free water surface of marboreh dam are presented in table 2 the cropping pattern of the irrigation network along with the economic and agronomic parameters of the crops are presented in table 3 the surface sprinkler and micro irrigation efficiency are considered 55 75 and 95 in the mathematical model respectively the water demand per hectare is calculated according to the percentage of the cropping pattern and water demand of each crop in each month the potential crop yield and the net benefit of crop sales are in fact two non deterministic parameters but in the present study they are considered deterministic parameters therefore for the whole period of operation 50 years the average values estimated for them are used 3 methodology and governing equations in this section the equations and constraints for the optimum design of a reservoir capacity and the downstream irrigation network area are presented with respect to the uncertainty of the inflow and for linear operation policies with the explicit method the objective function is maximizing the net benefit gained from the system at first the equations of the chance constraint stochastic programming are presented and then a deterministic equivalent model is defined 3 1 mathematical programming for the stochastic optimum design of a reservoir capacity and the downstream irrigation network area based on economic indicators with explicit method the equations and constraints governing the optimum design of a reservoir capacity and the downstream irrigation network area are presented as follows the net benefit is defined in the year zero which is the beginning year of the system operation in the following equations pv means the

cost of the dam and network these values are 625 000 15000 000 and 7500 dollars in this study respectively a linear regression method was used to calculate the construction cost of the dam in this equation b is the y intercept and a is the slope of the line by using this linear equation it is possible to estimate the construction cost of the dam for any capacity this regression was extracted from the economic studies report of marboreh dam 28 the y intercept of this equation is associated with the dead volume of the reservoir that is filled by sediment and the active volume of the reservoir is in the upper level of the dead volume the estimated construction cost of the irrigation network is represented by the multiplying a coefficient c into the network area economic studies of the irrigation network were used to determine the coefficient c 28 the percentages of cost of various stages for dam and the irrigation network are presented in the supplementary data no 1 m is the

k ycn is extracted from local studies 34 and fao guideline no 33 and 56 31 35 as shown in equation 11 similar deficit irrigation is applied for crops and if the reservoir is not able to fully supply the water demand the deficit irrigation will be equal for all crops this approach represents the water allocation policy and irrigation strategy of this study deficit irrigation occurs when crop yield is reduced due to receiving less water the main objective of the deficit irrigation is to increase the economic efficiency of water use equations 17 23 are related to the average and seasonal

following the deterministic equivalent of the stochastic optimization model is presented in two s type and sq type linear operation policies for the explicit method 3 2 the deterministic equivalent of the stochastic optimization model in s type operation policy the deterministic equivalent of the stochastic optimum design of the reservoir and network is different for s type and sq type operation policies in both linear policies of s type and sq type the reservoir balance equation is omitted from the constraints as follows the governing equation to release water according to the s type operation policy is given in equation 23 23 r m s m b m s type ldr b m is an unknown constant for month m which should be optimized in the model in this policy by combining the balance equation equation 7 and the s type policy equation relations 24 and 25 are obtained for the release volume r m and the storage volume s m of the reservoir in each month the y index which is related to the year has been eliminated from parameters r q and s and relations 24 and 25 are valid over all years 24 r m q m 1 b m 1 b m 25 s m q m 1 b m 1 equation 15 can be presented as equation 26 in this equation if

equation 11 r cm dt cm r m dt m is considered and the relation r cm r m dt m dt cm is provided thus by calculation of e min 1 r m dt m and multiplying into dt cm e min dt cm r cm is also computed in

irrigation network area and reservoir capacity changes in the net benefit other economic parameters and the optimum supply of network water demands are presented for various network areas and reservoir capacities the network area parameter and reservoir capacity are entered as a known and discrete parameter into the model the discrete values of the reservoir capacity are selected to cover a wide range of values moreover for any irrigation network area the range of the optimum reservoir capacities are specified for both operation policies by trial and error the results are presented for several reservoir capacities below and above the optimum range in order to determine how the net benefit changes the same reservoir capacities are considered for both operation policies in order to make a better comparison the results of the model show that in the s type policy a reservoir capacity of 150 million cubic meters is feasible and optimum therefore for the s type operation policy which essentially needs large capacities two capacities that are greater than 150 million cubic meters were included for the discrete amount of reservoir capacities in the sq type policy with increasing reservoir capacity of more than 60 million cubic meters the net benefit decreases sharply therefore the reservoir capacity of 60 and one capacity less than it are included for discrete amounts of reservoir capacity since the results should be compared for two operation policies under the same condition of reservoir capacity the values of 30 60 120 150 200 and 250 million cubic meters are considered for the reservoir capacity also if the capacity interval was considered equal the tables would be too lengthy the optimization model is defined in the lingo 16 software and the results are extracted in tables 4 and 5 the results are presented in two s type and sq type operating policies respectively the optimum reservoir capacity and other economic parameters for each network area are highlighted in these tables supplying the irrigation networks demands in each case is presented with two average and seasonal reliability parameters it should be noted that by considering equations 17 29 and 36 for s type policy and equations 17 51 and 58 for sq type policy the average reliability in tables 4 and 5 is the average of the parameter m the m is equal to the probability of fully supplying the demands in each month and is seasonal reliability accepted seasonal reliability is presented and is the minimum of m in all months accepted seasonal reliability is the minimum percentage of supplying the demand that is obtained in all months as shown in table 4 the reservoir s optimum capacity is constant in different areas of the network in this operation policy a low reservoir capacity is not even capable to provide the low demands and for a wide range of demands a high capacity is required the low reservoir capacities are not profitable in this policy and the output of the model is unfeasible in s type operation policy for low reservoir capacities this means that the model is not able to provide a linear relationship for the water release from the reservoir in the form of s type rule because the water release is dependent only on the reservoir storage sm and reservoir storage is zero in some months but this occurs rarely in high reservoir capacities in the sq type operation policy water release is dependent on the reservoir storage sm and the inflow into the reservoir qm causing the model to escape from the unfeasible status in the previous studies the answers of the s type operation policy are also unfeasible in some of the assumed reliabilities and cases 11 18 21 the objective function of the mentioned studies is minimizing the reservoir capacity while the reliabilities of supplying the demands are assumed in the model constraints the high reservoir capacity for the s type operation policy in comparison with other operation policies in the previous studies 11 17 21 indicates the non economic nature of this policy which is evident in this study the absence of economic indicators in the objective function and model constraints as well as the lack of discussion on the optimum reliability of supplying the demand in the explicit method are the limitations of previous studies the optimum reservoir capacity in the s type operation policy for low areas of the network is so high and by increasing the network area the same reservoir capacity is optimum as the network area increases the reliability of supply is reduced generally the net benefit in the network area of 20 000 hectares and the reservoir capacity of 150 million cubic meters is optimum the optimum average reliability is 52 4 in this operation policy increasing the reservoir capacity does not significantly increase the reliability of supply therefore for various areas of the network the first capacity that can be operated is optimum due to its low cost the accepted seasonal reliability is the minimum reliability of supplying the demands in various months of the year 12 months for the large networks this value is zero it means in some months no water was supplied for the smaller network this value can be greater than zero accepted seasonal reliability may be the same for a network area at various reservoir capacities this means that increasing the reservoir capacity increases the average reliability or average of m but the minimum of m is constant there is no clear trend for accepted seasonal reliability in a specific network area at various reservoir capacities for large areas of the network accepted seasonal reliability is set to zero generally the results of the sq type operation policy are presented in table 5 the net benefit for the same area of the network and the reservoir capacity is higher than the s type case in this operation policy the network area of 25 000 hectares is optimum and the reservoir capacity of 60 mcm results the highest net benefit the optimum reliability for sq type operation policy is 50 1 in both policies optimum accepted seasonal reliability is zero this shows that during the optimum supply of the demand the percentage of supply becomes zero and there are no supply in some months in fig 2 changes in net benefit and in fig 3 changes in the reliability versus the reservoir capacity with the network area of 25 000 hectares are presented as shown in figs 2 and 3 the net benefit and reliability for the sq type policy are higher than the s type policy in fig 4 changes in the optimum net benefit and in fig 5 changes in optimum reliability versus the network area are presented also in fig 6 changes in the benefit cost ratio versus the network are shown in both operation policies the results indicate that the sq type operation policy is more economical than the s type policy where with the s type operation policy a higher capacity for the reservoir is needed which leads to a lower net benefit with the same network area for two operation policies the net benefit for the sq type operation policy is higher than the s type policy the optimum reliability level is about 50 for both s type and sq type rules this optimum reliability can be used for simpler models that are not based on an economic objective function and for models with an assumed reliability parameter 5 conclusion in this research a stochastic optimization model for design of reservoir and the downstream irrigation network with economic objective function is presented using the explicit method the results are presented for two s type and sq type linear decision rules although the current study is presented for two common operation policies this method can be used for solving similar optimization problems with other operation policies like multiple sq type also this method can be used as a guide for inflow data with a different statistical distribution such as normal distribution which is more complex in addition the developed model in this study can be used in various climates with various hydro climatological conditions from the results of these supplementary studies the optimum reliability and optimum accepted deficit threshold can be provided for various climates these values can be used in simpler models that are based on assumed reliability as well as for accepted deficit thresholds where their objective functions are not economic the emphasis on extracting the optimum reliability level is due to this fact that in simple models the crop yield equation and its relationship with other constraints are generally ignored and the reliability for supply is pre assumed and the optimum network area and reservoir capacity are determined with these assumptions these assumptions can affect significantly on moving away the obtained answer from the real optimum solution appendix a supplementary data the following is the

8711,finland is a highly coastal country with a large archipelago area and numerous lakes consequently these provide an essential environment for water based outdoor recreation activities to improve the information base for evaluating the welfare effects of policy instruments addressing water quality such as the eu water framework directive this study examined the effects of changes in water quality on the recreation benefits focusing on swimming trips in finland national recreation inventory data were used to provide information on welfare changes at the national level the combined travel cost and contingent behavior approach revealed that the recreation value of a swimming trip in the current state was approximately 16 euros the approach allowed assessment of the welfare effects of water quality changes beyond the observed levels showing that a hypothetical decrease in water quality to a level at which the water visibility would be less than 1 m and abundant slime would exist decreased the value to 9 euros water quality improvement to a level at which the perceived water visibility would be over 2 m and no slime would exist increased the value per trip to 22 euros in total the overall annual value of all visits made for swimming in the case of water quality improvement increased the recreation benefits by 53 80 while a deterioration in quality decreased the benefits by approximately 80 keywords water quality travel cost contingent behavior national outdoor recreation survey 1 introduction the eu water framework directive s 1 goal of achieving a good ecological status for all waters in the eu by 2015 created a demand for studies on the costs and benefits associated with achieving this goal this demand still exists because planning of the management required to achieve a good ecological status is still ongoing in many european countries the increased quality and quantity of water recreation are significant elements of the potential benefits of the directive 2 3 beyond the pure existence of a good ecological status or market benefits such as a reduced need for water purification the relative importance of recreation benefits was shown to be significant in a study by ref 4 who found recreation to be the most substantial motivation for the willingness to pay for water conservation in sweden in finland where nearly ten percent of the country is covered by water and the coast and archipelago of the baltic sea together form a 46 000 km long coastline 5 water recreation particularly swimming is an important outdoor activity about two thirds of the finnish population annually swims in natural water systems 6 partly due to the strong leisure home culture 7 as the population of 5 million owns 500 000 leisure homes 85 of which are situated by a lake river or the sea since swimming is such a significant free time activity in finland it doubtless has effects on individual welfare and it is important to know how the benefits from swimming would be affected by potential changes in water quality currently 85 of the surface area of the lakes and 65 of rivers in finland are in excellent or good condition but over half of the baltic sea coastal waters are classified as having a less than good ecological status the poor quality of the coastal waters is mainly due to eutrophication 8 nutrient loading and other harmful releases to water systems have declined from those of the worst years but there is still much to improve new threats to water quality are also presumed due to climate change which might complicate achieving the goal of the directive for example nutrient loading is expected to increase due to increased precipitation and flooding 9 11 which will increase the risk of eutrophication 12 and higher temperatures are expected to promote harmful cyanobacteria algal blooming 13 furthermore new pressure towards intensification of the bioeconomy i e increasing the production from agriculture and forestry presents a challenge for controlling nutrient loads 14 to respond to these challenges information on the recreation benefits from water quality improvements is essential in the process of outlining greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies or climate change adaptation measures as well as policies for the bioeconomy benefit estimates are needed in identifying which nutrient reduction measures provide the highest benefit cost ratio furthermore estimates of the welfare effects of potential reductions in the water quality are needed if the total costs and benefits for different uses of land or other projects and actions influencing water quality are to be estimated and compared this study focused on the effects of changes in water quality on swimming behavior and recreation benefits the focus was set on swimming because it is the most popular water recreation activity among finns 6 and an activity directly affected by water quality a significant part of swimming visits take place in the citizen s home municipality 6 indicating that the activity is scattered throughout the country this emphasizes the importance of analyzing the effect of water quality on recreation benefits at the national level for this purpose we developed an approach that took into account the wide spatial range of swimming sites also providing a large range of water qualities we further improved the existing variation in water quality by combining the travel cost and contingent behavior approaches the estimated demand models based on this novel approach revealed the effect of water quality on water recreation and based on the models we calculated the welfare effects of water quality changes at the national scale 2 data and methods 2 1 valuing changes in recreation site quality traditionally the benefits of water related and other outdoor recreation have been estimated with the travel cost tc method 15 16 in this method the variation in travel costs among individuals is used to derive a demand curve for recreation which is then used to estimate the benefits of the recreation by calculating the consumer surplus the method is usually applied using data from a single site 16 however collecting data on only a single site provides no information on the effect of site quality on recreational value an alternative approach is to focus on site choice based on quality attributes utilizing the random utility framework 17 this approach is applicable when the set of alternative sites can be defined as the supply of recreation resources is wide in finland the set of alternative sites is very demanding to define an alternative approach is to combine data from several sites with varying characteristics to predict how the demand is affected by changes in site attributes 16 18 relatively few multisite recreation models have been constructed but some examples can be found for example shrestha et al 56 and englin and moeltner 19 pooled visits to several distinct outdoor recreation areas with variable natural characteristics or recreation facility levels in one travel cost model if the aim is to assess the recreation benefits from a variety of types of recreation assets at the national level an alternative is to use population based national data national recreation survey data have been applied in studies by refs 20 22 rockel and keally and zawacki et al 20 21 aggregated the number of trips at the us state level to assess the demand for non consumptive wildlife associated recreation vesterinen et al 22 investigated the demand for and welfare changes associated with water quality changes at aggregated swimming sites allowing for site specific attributes we used a similar approach to ref 22 employing national outdoor recreation survey data to construct a travel cost model according to the most recently visited sites in our case the typically visited sites based on respondent reported past behavior ward and beal 16 pointed out that multisite recreation demand models can be used to estimate the effects of proposed policies as long as the site attributes produced by policies lie within the range of observed attributes to broaden the range of site quality we extended the approach presented by ref 22 by supplementing travel cost data with the contingent behavior approach e g refs 23 25 in the contingent behavior cb method which is one of the stated preference methods for the valuation of non market goods respondents are asked about their future behavior under different environmental quality scenarios 26 with this approach changes in water quality outside the range of currently observed conditions can be examined 27 28 furthermore this approach provides statistical efficiency as each individual in the sample provides more than one observation 25 as well as a solution to the hypothetical bias problem a common problem in stated preferences studies as stated behavior is grounded in real behavior 25 29 our approach adds to the existing literature on the applications of combined tc cb analysis since the combined tc cb method has not previously been applied based on national data and aggregated sites 2 2 data and variables the data analyzed in this study comprised one section of the finnish national outdoor demand inventory 2009 2011 which was conducted by statistics finland as an assignment for the finnish forest research institute 6 the national outdoor demand inventory data were collected in six survey rounds in 2009 2010 from a random sample of 15 to 74 year olds from the finnish population register in each survey round 4000 people 24 000 in total were contacted in each of the rounds the survey included a general part that elicited information on general outdoor recreation behavior such as which outdoor activities the respondents participated in and how often in addition each survey round included a variable section collecting data on a particular theme such as that of water quality changes and swimming behavior investigated in this paper the data on swimming behavior and perceptions of water quality i e the data analyzed in this paper were collected in fall 2009 the data were collected using a combined internet and mail survey after sending the first request to respond to the internet survey a reminder was sent and finally a paper survey still including a possibility to complete the survey via the internet was mailed to those who had not responded to the internet survey a total of 1644 completed surveys were returned for the fall 2009 survey giving a response rate of 41 4 1 1 for the data analysis we eliminated 27 respondents whose identification code was missing from the inquiry or who had not completed the section of the survey eliciting information on water quality and swimming activity the descriptive statistics for this dataset are presented in table 1 the dependent variable in our modeling was the number of swimming trips made to a typical swimming site in the previous 12 months the contingent behavior model included both the actual and hypothetical trips while in the conventional travel cost model only the actual trips made were included the travel cost variable 2 2 for those respondents who reported that they typically go swimming from a leisure home the travel cost variable also consists of the costs associated with the distance between the place of origin in their case the leisure home and the typical swimming site any costs associated with travel from the home to the leisure home were not included in the travel cost variable since the survey data did not provide information on these costs this may have underestimated the travel cost since it is likely that swimming was one of the reasons why the respondents traveled to the leisure home in the first place was constructed from the respondent reported distance to the swimming site driving costs and the opportunity cost of time spent in traveling to the site the mean one way distance traveled to swim was approximately 11 km varying from zero to 500 km for half of the sample however the distance was only 1 5 km or less and 95 traveled at maximum 52 km to swim we decided to exclude the extreme 5 of the observations this reduced the estimation sample of the tc cb model by 7 respondents to exclude possible multiple purpose and overnight travelers from the sample to specify the driving costs information on the means of travel and travel distance is required since the data did not provide information on how the respondents traveled to the swimming site we instead used information on the relationship between distance and the means of travel concerning the last visited site for any recreation activity appendix i since 96 of respondents had traveled to their last visited site for any recreation activity by car or by foot bicycle an assumption was made that respondents also travel to their typical swimming site by car or by foot bicycle for those who were selected as car drivers the travel cost included driving costs and time costs vehicle costs were specified as the round trip distance from the starting place to the swimming place multiplied by the estimated driving costs i e 0 25 euros per km which is the tax deductible kilometer cost for a privately owned car in finland 30 respondents reported the one way distance which was then multiplied by two to obtain the round trip distance there is abundant discussion in the literature on the opportunity cost of time in travel cost models such as whether it should be included and if it is included how it should be specified e g refs 15 31 32 we decided to enter the time cost within the travel cost variable because the travel cost would otherwise have been zero for walkers and cyclists who constituted the largest proportion 71 of the sample we defined the opportunity cost of time as one third of the hourly income e g refs 15 33 35 the hourly income was calculated from the reported household monthly gross income which was divided by the number of adults in the household to obtain the monthly gross income per adult the gross income was then transformed to the net income by deducting the corresponding income tax rate finally the monthly net income per adult was divided by 158 h per month the standard working time in order to obtain the hourly income 3 3 although 44 of the respondents were not working retired students unemployed at home we assumed the same opportunity cost for all the members of the household as we did not have information on the individual income for non working household members we may have thus overestimated the opportunity cost of time consequently the time cost was defined as one third of the hourly income multiplied by the reported amount of time spent in traveling from the home to the swimming site accordingly the travel cost variable for car drivers was created as follows tc round trip distance from home to swimming site 0 25 number of adults in household 1 3 net hourly income per adult time spent on round trip from home to the swimming site for walkers and cyclists the travel cost variable consisted of the opportunity cost of time only to observe possible heterogeneity among respondents due to the travel mode we constructed a dummy variable for walkers and cyclists and included interaction of the travel mode dummy and travel cost in the models to obtain information on the water quality of their typically visited swimming site the respondents were asked to state their perceptions of water clarity and the amount of slime on piers and rocks of their typically visited water system water clarity and the amount of slime are easily observed and are also affected by eutrophication although the quality conditions were not described to the respondents with pictures or other illustrations such as in the studies of 24 36 we can assume that the finnish population was quite well aware of the quality conditions in the most frequently used water systems 37 the perceptions were also easy to acquire via a survey together with other collected data furthermore these indicators are objectively measurable and therefore applicable in policy design water clarity in particular has been found to be an important determinant of water recreation 34 and it has been shown to correlate with nutrient levels 38 39 respondents were asked about their perception of water quality attributes on a scale from one to four for water clarity a score of one indicated that the bottom of the typically visited water body could be seen from the surface at a water depth of over 2 m and a score four that the bottom was visible from the surface at a depth of about 10 cm for sliming a score of one indicated that there was no slime on piers or rocks and a score four that the slime could be felt on the skin during or after swimming the respondents appeared to consider their typically visited water systems to be in a relatively good condition with respect to these quality attributes of the sample 57 reported that the bottom of the water system could be seen from a depth of over 1 m over half of the respondents reported no slime and about 40 reported only some slime on piers and rocks the respondents water quality perceptions corresponded at least roughly with the objectively measured water quality measures in the sense that water quality in lakes was considered to be better than in rivers and on the seashore which is in accordance with the findings from the ecological classification of finnish water systems 40 furthermore water quality was perceived to be worse in western and southern finland than in other parts of the country which is also consistent with the ecological classification the first contingent behavior question asked how many times the respondents would go swimming at their typical swimming site in the next twelve months if the water quality of the water system improved to the level where the bottom of the water body could be seen from the surface at a depth of over 2 m and no slime was present this question was only posed to those respondents who did not perceive the quality of their typical site to be currently this high 69 respondents perceived water quality to already be this high second the respondents were asked how many swimming trips they would take in the next twelve months if the water quality decreased so that the bottom could be seen from a depth of less than 1 m and there was abundant slime on rocks and piers this question was not posed to those respondents whose typical site currently corresponded to this quality level 27 respondents perceived water quality to be currently this low water quality was included in the models using two dummy variables one indicating good and another poor water quality good quality means that the water clarity is over 2 m and no sliming exists poor water quality means that the bottom of the water can be seen from a depth of less than 1 m and abundant sliming exists or slime can be felt on the skin during or after swimming the reference quality was intermediate water i e water quality between these two descriptions for actual behavior water quality dummies were based on the respondents perceptions of the current water quality at the typical swimming site for contingent behavior under improved water quality the good water quality dummy was set to one and the poor water quality dummy to zero and vice versa under the decreased water quality scenario in order to measure the welfare effects of water quality changes interaction variables were specified between the travel cost variable and water quality dummies the interaction variables allowed the slope of the travel cost variable to vary due to changes in water quality and consequently allowed us to estimate changes in the consumer surplus due to water quality changes in addition to travel costs other variables found to be associated with recreation demand include demographic variables site quality and substitutes 16 in previous studies on swimming and beach visits demand has been found to be positively associated at least with age 41 42 a college education 43 and being retired 44 and negatively associated with full time employment the party size 45 and the number of children 46 in recreation demand studies the impact of income has often been found weak and the sign has varied across studies 41 42 47 49 the cost per trip to substitute sites is recommended to be included in the model although it is also often omitted due to the non availability of data e g ref 47 we did not have information from respondents on the substitute sites and the supply of water recreation resources in finland is so wide that the set of substitute sites would have been very demanding to define however we can assume that part of the effect of substitutes was captured by the dummy variable indicating that the place of residence was in a region with a high lake density known as lake finland 4 4 regions pirkanmaa central finland pohjois savo etelä savo and north karelia these regions are shown in a map of finland in appendix ii where the availability of swimming sites is even more extensive than in other parts of the country beyond the travel costs income and water quality variables only variables with a significance level of p 0 1 were included in the models presented here the respondent characteristics used in these models were household size household gross income and living in lake finland the influence of other characteristics such as age gender and whether the respondent was currently working as well as education and occupation was also tested but no significant effect on the number of swimming trips was found furthermore many of these factors were also highly correlated with the household gross monthly income the type of water system of the typical swimming site i e lake river or sea and interaction variables between the water system type and travel cost were also included in the model but no statistically significant effect on the number of swimming trips was found and the variables were omitted from the final models an important issue in combined tc cb models is the consistency of the preferences across the data since a lack of consistency will affect the welfare estimates in studies that have data on future trips under the current conditions a dummy variable identifying contingent behavior responses and interaction variables between the cb dummy and travel costs and the cb dummy and income have often been used to test for this consistency e g refs 26 50 51 with varying results our dataset did not include data on future trips under current conditions but as we had actual data on trips to swimming sites with varying quality and cb data on improved and decreased water quality levels we were able to include a cb dummy in the model to shed some light on the consistency in addition to the tc cb model we also estimated a basic travel cost model based on the actual behavior alone so that the results of the estimated models based on both data types could be compared 2 3 statistical models the demand function for swimming trips can be specified as y i q e β 0 β t c t c i β q d q β t c d q t c i d q β k x k i where yiq denotes the number of trips an individual i i 1 2 n makes under water quality q q 0 1 2 in the basic travel cost model q refers to the current water quality in the combined travel cost and contingent behavior models q refers to the water quality either current or hypothetical tc is the travel cost variable dq are dummy variables indicating poor or good water quality q 1 denoting good quality and q 2 denoting poor quality tc dq is the interaction variable between travel costs and the water quality dummies variables x ki denote the other k k 1 k independent variables coefficients β are estimated on the basis of the data collected the benefits of a swimming visit can be measured as a consumer surplus based on the estimated demand function and the welfare effects of water quality changes as a change in the consumer surplus due to the change in water quality since the number of swimming visits takes only non negative integer values a count data model should be used instead of a linear model 52 a common approach to modeling count data is to assume that the number of trips follows a poisson distribution if the conditional mean is equal to the variance 15 however in data on recreation visits the variance is frequently larger than the mean a negative binomial model nb is therefore often preferred in applications of the travel cost method and was also applied in this study for the model of actual trips the nb model is a poisson model that is extended with an additional gamma distributed parameter α which allows the variance to be larger than the mean the negative binomial probability function is given by pr y y iq γ y i q 1 α γ y i q 1 γ 1 α 1 α μ 1 α 1 α μ μ 1 α y i q where μ is the mean number of trips at quality q γ is a gamma probability density function for y iq and α is a gamma distributed parameter if α is zero no overdispersion exists and the model returns to the poisson model while if α is larger than zero overdispersion exists the conditional mean number of trips of the negative binomial regression is same as in the poisson model e y i x i μ exp x i β i but the variance is var y i μ 1 αμ pooling real and hypothetical behavior data together generated panel data with one observation based on actual behavior and two observations based on hypothetical behavior under decreased and improved water quality 5 5 as the contingent behavior questions were only posed to those respondents who did not already perceive their typical site s quality as high or low and due to some missing values each respondent had one to three observations depending on their perceptions of the current water quality multiple observations across individuals cause correlation in the error terms between the responses if unobservable individual characteristics affect both the current swimming frequency and the intended visit frequency under the hypothetical water quality scenarios 53 to take this into account we use random effects specification of the poisson model in the combined tc cb model 25 a practice adopted in several previous studies for example 24 25 46 54 in the random effects poisson model a gamma distributed random individual specific term α with mean e εi 1 and variance var εi 1 δ is added to the exponential mean function to take into account the unobservable individual characteristics and overdispersion 46 55 the density function of random effects poisson model is the following p r y i q q μ i q y i q y i q δ q μ i q δ δ q μ i q δ y i q γ q y i q δ γ δ the expected value of the distribution is e y i q μ i q and variance v a r y i q μ i q μ 1 q 2 δ 55 both the negative binomial model and the random effects poisson model provided us a semi log specification of the demand curve which allowed us to calculate the consumer surplus per trip with the formula cs y 1 β tc 15 β tc is the estimated coefficient of the travel cost variable and y is the expected number of swimming trips the consumer surplus of a swimming trip under improved water quality was calculated with the formula cs y 1 β tc β tc improvedwaterquality and that under decreased water quality was respectively calculated on the basis of the interaction variable between poor water quality and the travel cost the travel mode i e walking or cycling was taken into account with a similar approach 3 results table 2 presents the estimated recreation demand models first the basic travel cost model for actual trips taken model 1 6 6 data consisting of visits to typical swimming sites may lead to site selection bias in coefficients and welfare estimates because typical sites are likely to be more frequently visited than the average sites to measure the magnitude of the possible bias we estimated an endogenously stratified negative binomial model for actual trip data in order to examine whether the coefficients differ from the basic negative binomial model the models produced estimates of the same magnitude and significance and then the combined travel cost contingent behavior model model 2 7 8 7 we also estimated a random effects negative binomial model but the random effects poisson model proved to be superior based on the lr test the ability to predict visit frequency and the significance of the most relevant variables 8 we excluded 146 illogical observations from the pooled data i e responses that stated more trips under a decreased water quality scenario than under the current conditions as well as responses that stated more trips under the current conditions than under the hypothetical improved water quality negative binomial model was selected over the poisson model in model 1 due to the statistically significant coefficient for the over dispersion parameter alpha both models had some common characteristics that also followed the expectations the travel cost variable had a negative and statistically significant effect on the trip frequency and thus supported an ordinary downwards sloping demand curve for swimming trips the time cost for those who cycled or walked to the site also had a negative and significant effect on swimming trips the household gross income had a positive effect on trip frequency but was not statistically significant which is a common finding in the recreation demand literature a greater household size in turn statistically significantly decreased the swimming activity the place of residence being in the lake rich part of the country increased the activity but the effect was not statistically significant the variable was however left in the model to reflect the availability of substitute sites water quality affected swimming behavior as hypothesized good water quality increased the number of swimming visits and poor water quality reduced it incidence rate ratios calculated by exponentiating the regression coefficients of model 2 indicates that under good water quality the respondents would make 1 7 times more visits than under intermediate quality under poor water quality respondents would make only 0 67 times the number of visits they would do under intermediate quality in the tc cb model both water quality variables were statistically significant the interaction variables of water quality and travel costs were statistically significant and behaved as expected in the tc cb model in the tc model however the interaction variables were statistically nonsignificant and they were omitted from the model this probably resulted from the relatively low variation in the observed water quality levels as pointed out in the introduction a lack of variation in quality levels is a common problem when using a pooled travel cost model in the monetary valuation of changes in environmental quality in the tc cb model the estimates of the coefficients for the interaction variables suggest that beyond the effect of water quality on the number of swimming visits it also had an impact on the price elasticity of swimming demand even if water quality is currently on a relatively satisfactory level additional quality improvements would make people less responsive to changes in the travel costs water quality deterioration would in turn increase the price elasticity meaning that people would be more sensitive to changes in travel costs if water quality decreased the cb dummy had no significant effect on the visit frequency suggesting that behavior in actual and hypothetical settings was consistent the recreation values per person and per trip in terms of consumer surpluses are presented in table 3 first using model 1 we estimated the recreation value per visit at the current water quality level a separate estimate was calculated for cyclists and walkers based on the interaction variable of travel cost and the dummy for being a cyclist or walker on the basis of model 1 under the current water quality the consumer surplus estimates were 16 euros for car travellers for those who cycled or walked and had only time costs the estimated consumer surplus per trip was 7 euros second the recreation values were derived for a swimming trip under decreased and improved water quality on the basis of the corresponding interaction variables based on the tc cb model model 2 the consumer surplus of a swimming visit to a site where water clarity is over 2 m and no sliming exists was 22 euros for car travelers and 7 euros for walkers and cyclists in the case of poor water quality with clarity being less than 1 m and abundant slime present the consumer surplus was 9 euros for car travelers and 5 euros for others to calculate the aggregate welfare effects of water quality changes in addition to changes in per trip values we need to know how visit frequency changes in relation to changes in water quality the mean predicted number of trips from the tc cb model was 19 improved water quality increased it to 28 while decreased water quality in turn reduced it to 11 when holding other variables constant the model predictions correspond well with the reported number of visits the mean number of reported actual swimming visits made was 20 while the average response to a hypothetical question on visits under improved quality was 25 and under decreased quality 11 the aggregate welfare effects are calculated on the basis that according to the data 82 of the finnish 15 to 74 year old population 4 036 025 in 2009 had swum at least once during the previous 12 months the calculations do not however take into account that in addition to the visit frequency the number of people who go swimming may change due to water quality changes therefore the estimates of welfare changes may underestimate the true welfare effects in the calculation it was assumed that 71 of the recreational swimmers travel to their typical swimming site by foot or bicycle and the rest travel by a car as table 4 shows under the current water quality the aggregate consumer surplus of recreational swimming is estimated to be 600 630 million euros depending on whether it is calculated based on the mean reported trip frequency or the mean of the trip frequency predicted by model 2 if all water systems in finland were in such a condition that water clarity was over 2 m and no sliming existed the aggregate annual consumer surplus would be 960 1070 million euros respectively if all water systems were in such a poor condition that water clarity was less than 1 m and slime was abundant the aggregate consumer surplus would be 220 million euros hence attaining this improved water quality level in all the water systems in finland would increase the recreation benefits from swimming by 330 480 million euros 53 80 annually a deterioration in water quality to a poor level would in turn decrease the recreation benefits of swimming by 380 410 million euros 63 65 annually 4 discussion and conclusions this study demonstrated the effect of changes in water quality on the recreation benefits obtained from swimming thus the results respond to the demand for benefit studies on water quality changes furthermore the approach presented here provided an example of using national inventory data in combination with contingent behavior data and water quality perceptions to assess the welfare effects of water quality changes at the national level with a wide supply of recreational sites instead of focusing on one specific recreation site supplementing the data on actual visits with contingent behavior data allowed us to consider changes in water quality that are outside the currently observed quality levels the national recreation inventory data which included a representative sample of the finnish 15 to 74 year old population allowed us to focus on the most typical water recreation sites and to apply the travel cost method by pooling sites to estimate the welfare effects 22 56 as national recreation inventory data exist from several european countries 57 our approach could be more widely applied to evaluate the benefits related to policy instruments addressing water quality such as the eu water framework directive even though the results were promising future studies should consider how the use of multisite data and the focus on visits to the typical sites affect the valuation results typical sites are presumably visited more often than atypical ones which may lead to site selection bias furthermore the recreation benefits of atypical sites are presumably lower than those of typical ones therefore the estimate of the aggregate recreation benefits obtained from swimming may overestimate the true benefits because it is calculated by assuming that all swimming sites produce equal benefits furthermore the typical swimming sites may be selected so that their quality is already at a relatively satisfactory level welfare gains from water quality improvements may be higher at swimming sites where the water quality is currently at a lower level finally data on substitute sites would be needed to investigate how swimming trips might be allocated to different sites after water quality changes in our case typical inventory data were complemented with contingent behavior data the approach worked well in the sense that the two data types did not show considerable differences in their underlying preferences suggesting that the welfare measures obtained from the two types of data coincided however data on future trips under the current level of water quality would have been needed to obtain a more accurate comparison of the consistency between actual and contingent behavior the estimated econometric models for swimming trip demand appeared to perform well as almost all of the coefficients in the models were statistically significant the consumer surplus of a swimming trip with the current mean water quality was estimated to be either 7 or 16 euros depending on the means of traveling which is in line with previous estimates for comparison based on 1998 2000 recreation inventory data 22 estimated the value of a swimming trip to be from 6 to 19 euros our analysis relied on perceived water quality we demonstrated that the perceived current state can be successfully used as a reference level for a contingent behavior study in previous studies it has also been suggested that in the case of environmental goods that are familiar and readily observable such as eutrophication related water quality respondents perceptions provide an adequate reference level 58 in order to further improve the accuracy of estimates of the welfare effects of environmental quality changes national recreation inventory data could be supplemented with gis data gis information on outdoor recreation sites and the distribution of recreation visits would enable the benefits of outdoor recreation and the welfare effects of environmental quality changes to be estimated based on objectively measured environmental quality data from a policy perspective the effects of changes in water quality on recreation benefits are more relevant than the current benefits the estimated potential welfare loss due to a deterioration in water quality emphasizes the importance of water resources as a recreation service for finns according to the results the aggregate recreation benefits from swimming would increase by 53 80 from the current level if the water quality attained a good perceived level throughout the country the benefit measure for quality improvement is policy relevant particularly on the coast of the baltic sea where the potential exists to increase welfare by improving water quality the high welfare estimates for improving water quality even encourage policy that goes beyond the demand for a good environmental status in the eu water framework directive although the obtained benefit estimates for an improvement in quality were high they theoretically represent a lower bound of benefits since non use values were not included in the analysis and due to the scope of the study other use benefits than those obtained from swimming were not included acknowledgements we thank heini ahtiainen janne artell and tuija sievänen for their contribution to the survey design and riina nyberg and vesa virtanen for

8711,finland is a highly coastal country with a large archipelago area and numerous lakes consequently these provide an essential environment for water based outdoor recreation activities to improve the information base for evaluating the welfare effects of policy instruments addressing water quality such as the eu water framework directive this study examined the effects of changes in water quality on the recreation benefits focusing on swimming trips in finland national recreation inventory data were used to provide information on welfare changes at the national level the combined travel cost and contingent behavior approach revealed that the recreation value of a swimming trip in the current state was approximately 16 euros the approach allowed assessment of the welfare effects of water quality changes beyond the observed levels showing that a hypothetical decrease in water quality to a level at which the water visibility would be less than 1 m and abundant slime would exist decreased the value to 9 euros water quality improvement to a level at which the perceived water visibility would be over 2 m and no slime would exist increased the value per trip to 22 euros in total the overall annual value of all visits made for swimming in the case of water quality improvement increased the recreation benefits by 53 80 while a deterioration in quality decreased the benefits by approximately 80 keywords water quality travel cost contingent behavior national outdoor recreation survey 1 introduction the eu water framework directive s 1 goal of achieving a good ecological status for all waters in the eu by 2015 created a demand for studies on the costs and benefits associated with achieving this goal this demand still exists because planning of the management required to achieve a good ecological status is still ongoing in many european countries the increased quality and quantity of water recreation are significant elements of the potential benefits of the directive 2 3 beyond the pure existence of a good ecological status or market benefits such as a reduced need for water purification the relative importance of recreation benefits was shown to be significant in a study by ref 4 who found recreation to be the most substantial motivation for the willingness to pay for water conservation in sweden in finland where nearly ten percent of the country is covered by water and the coast and archipelago of the baltic sea together form a 46 000 km long coastline 5 water recreation particularly swimming is an important outdoor activity about two thirds of the finnish population annually swims in natural water systems 6 partly due to the strong leisure home culture 7 as the population of 5 million owns 500 000 leisure homes 85 of which are situated by a lake river or the sea since swimming is such a significant free time activity in finland it doubtless has effects on individual welfare and it is important to know how the benefits from swimming would be affected by potential changes in water quality currently 85 of the surface area of the lakes and 65 of rivers in finland are in excellent or good condition but over half of the baltic sea coastal waters are classified as having a less than good ecological status the poor quality of the coastal waters is mainly due to eutrophication 8 nutrient loading and other harmful releases to water systems have declined from those of the worst years but there is still much to improve new threats to water quality are also presumed due to climate change which might complicate achieving the goal of the directive for example nutrient loading is expected to increase due to increased precipitation and flooding 9 11 which will increase the risk of eutrophication 12 and higher temperatures are expected to promote harmful cyanobacteria algal blooming 13 furthermore new pressure towards intensification of the bioeconomy i e increasing the production from agriculture and forestry presents a challenge for controlling nutrient loads 14 to respond to these challenges information on the recreation benefits from water quality improvements is essential in the process of outlining greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies or climate change adaptation measures as well as policies for the bioeconomy benefit estimates are needed in identifying which nutrient reduction measures provide the highest benefit cost ratio furthermore estimates of the welfare effects of potential reductions in the water quality are needed if the total costs and benefits for different uses of land or other projects and actions influencing water quality are to be estimated and compared this study focused on the effects of changes in water quality on swimming behavior and recreation benefits the focus was set on swimming because it is the most popular water recreation activity among finns 6 and an activity directly affected by water quality a significant part of swimming visits take place in the citizen s home municipality 6 indicating that the activity is scattered throughout the country this emphasizes the importance of analyzing the effect of water quality on recreation benefits at the national level for this purpose we developed an approach that took into account the wide spatial range of swimming sites also providing a large range of water qualities we further improved the existing variation in water quality by combining the travel cost and contingent behavior approaches the estimated demand models based on this novel approach revealed the effect of water quality on water recreation and based on the models we calculated the welfare effects of water quality changes at the national scale 2 data and methods 2 1 valuing changes in recreation site quality traditionally the benefits of water related and other outdoor recreation have been estimated with the travel cost tc method 15 16 in this method the variation in travel costs among individuals is used to derive a demand curve for recreation which is then used to estimate the benefits of the recreation by calculating the consumer surplus the method is usually applied using data from a single site 16 however collecting data on only a single site provides no information on the effect of site quality on recreational value an alternative approach is to focus on site choice based on quality attributes utilizing the random utility framework 17 this approach is applicable when the set of alternative sites can be defined as the supply of recreation resources is wide in finland the set of alternative sites is very demanding to define an alternative approach is to combine data from several sites with varying characteristics to predict how the demand is affected by changes in site attributes 16 18 relatively few multisite recreation models have been constructed but some examples can be found for example shrestha et al 56 and englin and moeltner 19 pooled visits to several distinct outdoor recreation areas with variable natural characteristics or recreation facility levels in one travel cost model if the aim is to assess the recreation benefits from a variety of types of recreation assets at the national level an alternative is to use population based national data national recreation survey data have been applied in studies by refs 20 22 rockel and keally and zawacki et al 20 21 aggregated the number of trips at the us state level to assess the demand for non consumptive wildlife associated recreation vesterinen et al 22 investigated the demand for and welfare changes associated with water quality changes at aggregated swimming sites allowing for site specific attributes we used a similar approach to ref 22 employing national outdoor recreation survey data to construct a travel cost model according to the most recently visited sites in our case the typically visited sites based on respondent reported past behavior ward and beal 16 pointed out that multisite recreation demand models can be used to estimate the effects of proposed policies as long as the site attributes produced by policies lie within the range of observed attributes to broaden the range of site quality we extended the approach presented by ref 22 by supplementing travel cost data with the contingent behavior approach e g refs 23 25 in the contingent behavior cb method which is one of the stated preference methods for the valuation of non market goods respondents are asked about their future behavior under different environmental quality scenarios 26 with this approach changes in water quality outside the range of currently observed conditions can be examined 27 28 furthermore this approach provides statistical efficiency as each individual in the sample provides more than one observation 25 as well as a solution to the hypothetical bias problem a common problem in stated preferences studies as stated behavior is grounded in real behavior 25 29 our approach adds to the existing literature on the applications of combined tc cb analysis since the combined tc cb method has not previously been applied based on national data and aggregated sites 2 2 data and variables the data analyzed in this study comprised one section of the finnish national outdoor demand inventory 2009 2011 which was conducted by statistics finland as an assignment for the finnish forest research institute 6 the national outdoor demand inventory data were collected in six survey rounds in 2009 2010 from a random sample of 15 to 74 year olds from the finnish population register in each survey round 4000 people 24 000 in total were contacted in each of the rounds the survey included a general part that elicited information on general outdoor recreation behavior such as which outdoor activities the respondents participated in and how often in addition each survey round included a variable section collecting data on a particular theme such as that of water quality changes and swimming behavior investigated in this paper the data on swimming behavior and perceptions of water quality i e the data analyzed in this paper were collected in fall 2009 the data were collected using a combined internet and mail survey after sending the first request to respond to the internet survey a reminder was sent and finally a paper survey still including a possibility to complete the survey via the internet was mailed to those who had not responded to the internet survey a total of 1644 completed surveys were returned for the fall 2009 survey giving a response rate of 41 4 1 1 for the data analysis we eliminated 27 respondents whose identification code was missing from the inquiry or who had not completed the section of the survey eliciting information on water quality and swimming activity the descriptive statistics for this dataset are presented in table 1 the dependent variable in our modeling was the number of swimming trips made to a typical swimming site in the previous 12 months the contingent behavior model included both the actual and hypothetical trips while in the conventional travel cost model only the actual trips made were included the travel cost variable 2 2 for those respondents who reported that they typically go swimming from a leisure home the travel cost variable also consists of the costs associated with the distance between the place of origin in their case the leisure home and the typical swimming site any costs associated with travel from the home to the leisure home were not included in the travel cost variable since the survey data did not provide information on these costs this may have underestimated the travel cost since it is likely that swimming was one of the reasons why the respondents traveled to the leisure home in the first place was constructed from the respondent reported distance to the swimming site driving costs and the opportunity cost of time spent in traveling to the site the mean one way distance traveled to swim was approximately 11 km varying from zero to 500 km for half of the sample however the distance was only 1 5 km or less and 95 traveled at maximum 52 km to swim we decided to exclude the extreme 5 of the observations this reduced the estimation sample of the tc cb model by 7 respondents to exclude possible multiple purpose and overnight travelers from the sample to specify the driving costs information on the means of travel and travel distance is required since the data did not provide information on how the respondents traveled to the swimming site we instead used information on the relationship between distance and the means of travel concerning the last visited site for any recreation activity appendix i since 96 of respondents had traveled to their last visited site for any recreation activity by car or by foot bicycle an assumption was made that respondents also travel to their typical swimming site by car or by foot bicycle for those who were selected as car drivers the travel cost included driving costs and time costs vehicle costs were specified as the round trip distance from the starting place to the swimming place multiplied by the estimated driving costs i e 0 25 euros per km which is the tax deductible kilometer cost for a privately owned car in finland 30 respondents reported the one way distance which was then multiplied by two to obtain the round trip distance there is abundant discussion in the literature on the opportunity cost of time in travel cost models such as whether it should be included and if it is included how it should be specified e g refs 15 31 32 we decided to enter the time cost within the travel cost variable because the travel cost would otherwise have been zero for walkers and cyclists who constituted the largest proportion 71 of the sample we defined the opportunity cost of time as one third of the hourly income e g refs 15 33 35 the hourly income was calculated from the reported household monthly gross income which was divided by the number of adults in the household to obtain the monthly gross income per adult the gross income was then transformed to the net income by deducting the corresponding income tax rate finally the monthly net income per adult was divided by 158 h per month the standard working time in order to obtain the hourly income 3 3 although 44 of the respondents were not working retired students unemployed at home we assumed the same opportunity cost for all the members of the household as we did not have information on the individual income for non working household members we may have thus overestimated the opportunity cost of time consequently the time cost was defined as one third of the hourly income multiplied by the reported amount of time spent in traveling from the home to the swimming site accordingly the travel cost variable for car drivers was created as follows tc round trip distance from home to swimming site 0 25 number of adults in household 1 3 net hourly income per adult time spent on round trip from home to the swimming site for walkers and cyclists the travel cost variable consisted of the opportunity cost of time only to observe possible heterogeneity among respondents due to the travel mode we constructed a dummy variable for walkers and cyclists and included interaction of the travel mode dummy and travel cost in the models to obtain information on the water quality of their typically visited swimming site the respondents were asked to state their perceptions of water clarity and the amount of slime on piers and rocks of their typically visited water system water clarity and the amount of slime are easily observed and are also affected by eutrophication although the quality conditions were not described to the respondents with pictures or other illustrations such as in the studies of 24 36 we can assume that the finnish population was quite well aware of the quality conditions in the most frequently used water systems 37 the perceptions were also easy to acquire via a survey together with other collected data furthermore these indicators are objectively measurable and therefore applicable in policy design water clarity in particular has been found to be an important determinant of water recreation 34 and it has been shown to correlate with nutrient levels 38 39 respondents were asked about their perception of water quality attributes on a scale from one to four for water clarity a score of one indicated that the bottom of the typically visited water body could be seen from the surface at a water depth of over 2 m and a score four that the bottom was visible from the surface at a depth of about 10 cm for sliming a score of one indicated that there was no slime on piers or rocks and a score four that the slime could be felt on the skin during or after swimming the respondents appeared to consider their typically visited water systems to be in a relatively good condition with respect to these quality attributes of the sample 57 reported that the bottom of the water system could be seen from a depth of over 1 m over half of the respondents reported no slime and about 40 reported only some slime on piers and rocks the respondents water quality perceptions corresponded at least roughly with the objectively measured water quality measures in the sense that water quality in lakes was considered to be better than in rivers and on the seashore which is in accordance with the findings from the ecological classification of finnish water systems 40 furthermore water quality was perceived to be worse in western and southern finland than in other parts of the country which is also consistent with the ecological classification the first contingent behavior question asked how many times the respondents would go swimming at their typical swimming site in the next twelve months if the water quality of the water system improved to the level where the bottom of the water body could be seen from the surface at a depth of over 2 m and no slime was present this question was only posed to those respondents who did not perceive the quality of their typical site to be currently this high 69 respondents perceived water quality to already be this high second the respondents were asked how many swimming trips they would take in the next twelve months if the water quality decreased so that the bottom could be seen from a depth of less than 1 m and there was abundant slime on rocks and piers this question was not posed to those respondents whose typical site currently corresponded to this quality level 27 respondents perceived water quality to be currently this low water quality was included in the models using two dummy variables one indicating good and another poor water quality good quality means that the water clarity is over 2 m and no sliming exists poor water quality means that the bottom of the water can be seen from a depth of less than 1 m and abundant sliming exists or slime can be felt on the skin during or after swimming the reference quality was intermediate water i e water quality between these two descriptions for actual behavior water quality dummies were based on the respondents perceptions of the current water quality at the typical swimming site for contingent behavior under improved water quality the good water quality dummy was set to one and the poor water quality dummy to zero and vice versa under the decreased water quality scenario in order to measure the welfare effects of water quality changes interaction variables were specified between the travel cost variable and water quality dummies the interaction variables allowed the slope of the travel cost variable to vary due to changes in water quality and consequently allowed us to estimate changes in the consumer surplus due to water quality changes in addition to travel costs other variables found to be associated with recreation demand include demographic variables site quality and substitutes 16 in previous studies on swimming and beach visits demand has been found to be positively associated at least with age 41 42 a college education 43 and being retired 44 and negatively associated with full time employment the party size 45 and the number of children 46 in recreation demand studies the impact of income has often been found weak and the sign has varied across studies 41 42 47 49 the cost per trip to substitute sites is recommended to be included in the model although it is also often omitted due to the non availability of data e g ref 47 we did not have information from respondents on the substitute sites and the supply of water recreation resources in finland is so wide that the set of substitute sites would have been very demanding to define however we can assume that part of the effect of substitutes was captured by the dummy variable indicating that the place of residence was in a region with a high lake density known as lake finland 4 4 regions pirkanmaa central finland pohjois savo etelä savo and north karelia these regions are shown in a map of finland in appendix ii where the availability of swimming sites is even more extensive than in other parts of the country beyond the travel costs income and water quality variables only variables with a significance level of p 0 1 were included in the models presented here the respondent characteristics used in these models were household size household gross income and living in lake finland the influence of other characteristics such as age gender and whether the respondent was currently working as well as education and occupation was also tested but no significant effect on the number of swimming trips was found furthermore many of these factors were also highly correlated with the household gross monthly income the type of water system of the typical swimming site i e lake river or sea and interaction variables between the water system type and travel cost were also included in the model but no statistically significant effect on the number of swimming trips was found and the variables were omitted from the final models an important issue in combined tc cb models is the consistency of the preferences across the data since a lack of consistency will affect the welfare estimates in studies that have data on future trips under the current conditions a dummy variable identifying contingent behavior responses and interaction variables between the cb dummy and travel costs and the cb dummy and income have often been used to test for this consistency e g refs 26 50 51 with varying results our dataset did not include data on future trips under current conditions but as we had actual data on trips to swimming sites with varying quality and cb data on improved and decreased water quality levels we were able to include a cb dummy in the model to shed some light on the consistency in addition to the tc cb model we also estimated a basic travel cost model based on the actual behavior alone so that the results of the estimated models based on both data types could be compared 2 3 statistical models the demand function for swimming trips can be specified as y i q e β 0 β t c t c i β q d q β t c d q t c i d q β k x k i where yiq denotes the number of trips an individual i i 1 2 n makes under water quality q q 0 1 2 in the basic travel cost model q refers to the current water quality in the combined travel cost and contingent behavior models q refers to the water quality either current or hypothetical tc is the travel cost variable dq are dummy variables indicating poor or good water quality q 1 denoting good quality and q 2 denoting poor quality tc dq is the interaction variable between travel costs and the water quality dummies variables x ki denote the other k k 1 k independent variables coefficients β are estimated on the basis of the data collected the benefits of a swimming visit can be measured as a consumer surplus based on the estimated demand function and the welfare effects of water quality changes as a change in the consumer surplus due to the change in water quality since the number of swimming visits takes only non negative integer values a count data model should be used instead of a linear model 52 a common approach to modeling count data is to assume that the number of trips follows a poisson distribution if the conditional mean is equal to the variance 15 however in data on recreation visits the variance is frequently larger than the mean a negative binomial model nb is therefore often preferred in applications of the travel cost method and was also applied in this study for the model of actual trips the nb model is a poisson model that is extended with an additional gamma distributed parameter α which allows the variance to be larger than the mean the negative binomial probability function is given by pr y y iq γ y i q 1 α γ y i q 1 γ 1 α 1 α μ 1 α 1 α μ μ 1 α y i q where μ is the mean number of trips at quality q γ is a gamma probability density function for y iq and α is a gamma distributed parameter if α is zero no overdispersion exists and the model returns to the poisson model while if α is larger than zero overdispersion exists the conditional mean number of trips of the negative binomial regression is same as in the poisson model e y i x i μ exp x i β i but the variance is var y i μ 1 αμ pooling real and hypothetical behavior data together generated panel data with one observation based on actual behavior and two observations based on hypothetical behavior under decreased and improved water quality 5 5 as the contingent behavior questions were only posed to those respondents who did not already perceive their typical site s quality as high or low and due to some missing values each respondent had one to three observations depending on their perceptions of the current water quality multiple observations across individuals cause correlation in the error terms between the responses if unobservable individual characteristics affect both the current swimming frequency and the intended visit frequency under the hypothetical water quality scenarios 53 to take this into account we use random effects specification of the poisson model in the combined tc cb model 25 a practice adopted in several previous studies for example 24 25 46 54 in the random effects poisson model a gamma distributed random individual specific term α with mean e εi 1 and variance var εi 1 δ is added to the exponential mean function to take into account the unobservable individual characteristics and overdispersion 46 55 the density function of random effects poisson model is the following p r y i q q μ i q y i q y i q δ q μ i q δ δ q μ i q δ y i q γ q y i q δ γ δ the expected value of the distribution is e y i q μ i q and variance v a r y i q μ i q μ 1 q 2 δ 55 both the negative binomial model and the random effects poisson model provided us a semi log specification of the demand curve which allowed us to calculate the consumer surplus per trip with the formula cs y 1 β tc 15 β tc is the estimated coefficient of the travel cost variable and y is the expected number of swimming trips the consumer surplus of a swimming trip under improved water quality was calculated with the formula cs y 1 β tc β tc improvedwaterquality and that under decreased water quality was respectively calculated on the basis of the interaction variable between poor water quality and the travel cost the travel mode i e walking or cycling was taken into account with a similar approach 3 results table 2 presents the estimated recreation demand models first the basic travel cost model for actual trips taken model 1 6 6 data consisting of visits to typical swimming sites may lead to site selection bias in coefficients and welfare estimates because typical sites are likely to be more frequently visited than the average sites to measure the magnitude of the possible bias we estimated an endogenously stratified negative binomial model for actual trip data in order to examine whether the coefficients differ from the basic negative binomial model the models produced estimates of the same magnitude and significance and then the combined travel cost contingent behavior model model 2 7 8 7 we also estimated a random effects negative binomial model but the random effects poisson model proved to be superior based on the lr test the ability to predict visit frequency and the significance of the most relevant variables 8 we excluded 146 illogical observations from the pooled data i e responses that stated more trips under a decreased water quality scenario than under the current conditions as well as responses that stated more trips under the current conditions than under the hypothetical improved water quality negative binomial model was selected over the poisson model in model 1 due to the statistically significant coefficient for the over dispersion parameter alpha both models had some common characteristics that also followed the expectations the travel cost variable had a negative and statistically significant effect on the trip frequency and thus supported an ordinary downwards sloping demand curve for swimming trips the time cost for those who cycled or walked to the site also had a negative and significant effect on swimming trips the household gross income had a positive effect on trip frequency but was not statistically significant which is a common finding in the recreation demand literature a greater household size in turn statistically significantly decreased the swimming activity the place of residence being in the lake rich part of the country increased the activity but the effect was not statistically significant the variable was however left in the model to reflect the availability of substitute sites water quality affected swimming behavior as hypothesized good water quality increased the number of swimming visits and poor water quality reduced it incidence rate ratios calculated by exponentiating the regression coefficients of model 2 indicates that under good water quality the respondents would make 1 7 times more visits than under intermediate quality under poor water quality respondents would make only 0 67 times the number of visits they would do under intermediate quality in the tc cb model both water quality variables were statistically significant the interaction variables of water quality and travel costs were statistically significant and behaved as expected in the tc cb model in the tc model however the interaction variables were statistically nonsignificant and they were omitted from the model this probably resulted from the relatively low variation in the observed water quality levels as pointed out in the introduction a lack of variation in quality levels is a common problem when using a pooled travel cost model in the monetary valuation of changes in environmental quality in the tc cb model the estimates of the coefficients for the interaction variables suggest that beyond the effect of water quality on the number of swimming visits it also had an impact on the price elasticity of swimming demand even if water quality is currently on a relatively satisfactory level additional quality improvements would make people less responsive to changes in the travel costs water quality deterioration would in turn increase the price elasticity meaning that people would be more sensitive to changes in travel costs if water quality decreased the cb dummy had no significant effect on the visit frequency suggesting that behavior in actual and hypothetical settings was consistent the recreation values per person and per trip in terms of consumer surpluses are presented in table 3 first using model 1 we estimated the recreation value per visit at the current water quality level a separate estimate was calculated for cyclists and walkers based on the interaction variable of travel cost and the dummy for being a cyclist or walker on the basis of model 1 under the current water quality the consumer surplus estimates were 16 euros for car travellers for those who cycled or walked and had only time costs the estimated consumer surplus per trip was 7 euros second the recreation values were derived for a swimming trip under decreased and improved water quality on the basis of the corresponding interaction variables based on the tc cb model model 2 the consumer surplus of a swimming visit to a site where water clarity is over 2 m and no sliming exists was 22 euros for car travelers and 7 euros for walkers and cyclists in the case of poor water quality with clarity being less than 1 m and abundant slime present the consumer surplus was 9 euros for car travelers and 5 euros for others to calculate the aggregate welfare effects of water quality changes in addition to changes in per trip values we need to know how visit frequency changes in relation to changes in water quality the mean predicted number of trips from the tc cb model was 19 improved water quality increased it to 28 while decreased water quality in turn reduced it to 11 when holding other variables constant the model predictions correspond well with the reported number of visits the mean number of reported actual swimming visits made was 20 while the average response to a hypothetical question on visits under improved quality was 25 and under decreased quality 11 the aggregate welfare effects are calculated on the basis that according to the data 82 of the finnish 15 to 74 year old population 4 036 025 in 2009 had swum at least once during the previous 12 months the calculations do not however take into account that in addition to the visit frequency the number of people who go swimming may change due to water quality changes therefore the estimates of welfare changes may underestimate the true welfare effects in the calculation it was assumed that 71 of the recreational swimmers travel to their typical swimming site by foot or bicycle and the rest travel by a car as table 4 shows under the current water quality the aggregate consumer surplus of recreational swimming is estimated to be 600 630 million euros depending on whether it is calculated based on the mean reported trip frequency or the mean of the trip frequency predicted by model 2 if all water systems in finland were in such a condition that water clarity was over 2 m and no sliming existed the aggregate annual consumer surplus would be 960 1070 million euros respectively if all water systems were in such a poor condition that water clarity was less than 1 m and slime was abundant the aggregate consumer surplus would be 220 million euros hence attaining this improved water quality level in all the water systems in finland would increase the recreation benefits from swimming by 330 480 million euros 53 80 annually a deterioration in water quality to a poor level would in turn decrease the recreation benefits of swimming by 380 410 million euros 63 65 annually 4 discussion and conclusions this study demonstrated the effect of changes in water quality on the recreation benefits obtained from swimming thus the results respond to the demand for benefit studies on water quality changes furthermore the approach presented here provided an example of using national inventory data in combination with contingent behavior data and water quality perceptions to assess the welfare effects of water quality changes at the national level with a wide supply of recreational sites instead of focusing on one specific recreation site supplementing the data on actual visits with contingent behavior data allowed us to consider changes in water quality that are outside the currently observed quality levels the national recreation inventory data which included a representative sample of the finnish 15 to 74 year old population allowed us to focus on the most typical water recreation sites and to apply the travel cost method by pooling sites to estimate the welfare effects 22 56 as national recreation inventory data exist from several european countries 57 our approach could be more widely applied to evaluate the benefits related to policy instruments addressing water quality such as the eu water framework directive even though the results were promising future studies should consider how the use of multisite data and the focus on visits to the typical sites affect the valuation results typical sites are presumably visited more often than atypical ones which may lead to site selection bias furthermore the recreation benefits of atypical sites are presumably lower than those of typical ones therefore the estimate of the aggregate recreation benefits obtained from swimming may overestimate the true benefits because it is calculated by assuming that all swimming sites produce equal benefits furthermore the typical swimming sites may be selected so that their quality is already at a relatively satisfactory level welfare gains from water quality improvements may be higher at swimming sites where the water quality is currently at a lower level finally data on substitute sites would be needed to investigate how swimming trips might be allocated to different sites after water quality changes in our case typical inventory data were complemented with contingent behavior data the approach worked well in the sense that the two data types did not show considerable differences in their underlying preferences suggesting that the welfare measures obtained from the two types of data coincided however data on future trips under the current level of water quality would have been needed to obtain a more accurate comparison of the consistency between actual and contingent behavior the estimated econometric models for swimming trip demand appeared to perform well as almost all of the coefficients in the models were statistically significant the consumer surplus of a swimming trip with the current mean water quality was estimated to be either 7 or 16 euros depending on the means of traveling which is in line with previous estimates for comparison based on 1998 2000 recreation inventory data 22 estimated the value of a swimming trip to be from 6 to 19 euros our analysis relied on perceived water quality we demonstrated that the perceived current state can be successfully used as a reference level for a contingent behavior study in previous studies it has also been suggested that in the case of environmental goods that are familiar and readily observable such as eutrophication related water quality respondents perceptions provide an adequate reference level 58 in order to further improve the accuracy of estimates of the welfare effects of environmental quality changes national recreation inventory data could be supplemented with gis data gis information on outdoor recreation sites and the distribution of recreation visits would enable the benefits of outdoor recreation and the welfare effects of environmental quality changes to be estimated based on objectively measured environmental quality data from a policy perspective the effects of changes in water quality on recreation benefits are more relevant than the current benefits the estimated potential welfare loss due to a deterioration in water quality emphasizes the importance of water resources as a recreation service for finns according to the results the aggregate recreation benefits from swimming would increase by 53 80 from the current level if the water quality attained a good perceived level throughout the country the benefit measure for quality improvement is policy relevant particularly on the coast of the baltic sea where the potential exists to increase welfare by improving water quality the high welfare estimates for improving water quality even encourage policy that goes beyond the demand for a good environmental status in the eu water framework directive although the obtained benefit estimates for an improvement in quality were high they theoretically represent a lower bound of benefits since non use values were not included in the analysis and due to the scope of the study other use benefits than those obtained from swimming were not included acknowledgements we thank heini ahtiainen janne artell and tuija sievänen for their contribution to the survey design and riina nyberg and vesa virtanen for

8712,within south east asia certification and local market development may play an important role in incentivizing farmers to continue with nature based solutions delivered by organic or traditional farming practices and avoid using environmentally detrimental production techniques the purpose of this study is to use economic valuation in order to achieve an empirical understanding of local consumer preferences for different attributes of rice products application of the agrarian system approach reveals that rice cultivation systems observed in the tonle sape lake of the mekong river basin in cambodia our study case may target three ecosystem services that present the characteristics of public goods and may benefit consumer support a choice experiment survey was administered among local consumers in the city of phnom penh in 2013 econometric analysis indicates high rate of non attendance for the price attribute it also suggests that 17 of the respondents made their choices neglecting attributes describing ecosystem services however there are evidence of consumers willingness to pay wtp for certified organic rice higher than the price premium observed on the local market furthermore there is additional wtp value for the preservation of ecosystem services we discuss the implications of our findings on potential payment for ecosystem services in the specific case of rice 1 introduction for many countries in southeast asia implementation of new varieties high application of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to boost agricultural productivity 1 remain a major feature of agricultural practices aimed at ensuring future food security for local populations and helping farmers work their way out of poverty 2 3 however for many regions intensive farming practices have implications for the structure and functions of ecosystems which may alter the resilience of agro ecosystems and the well being of poor farmers who rely more directly on ecosystem functions and services 4 this is notably the case for rice production in cambodia the country was not part of the green revolution initiated in the 1960 s by other countries and maintained its own traditional practices of agriculture until joining the asean free trade area in 1999 to satisfy national export targets the agricultural sector is oriented towards an intensive model involving chemical inputs irrigation and only 10 selected high yield varieties of rice given that the majority of cambodia s rice is grown within the floodplain of tonle sap lake 5 6 these practices pose a risk to water quality agro chemical residues threaten food security and public health as a large part of the urban and rural population rely on rice field species rats and snails insects frogs snakes as well as a lot of other inland aquatic species as important sources of proteins 7 8 a large body of the literature argues that developing organic farming labelling could be a solution to resolving environmental problems in agro ecosystems thus improving the livelihood of rural people and helping to meet the demand for safe food for consumers 9 10 traditional agricultural practices are also organic by default or near organic as they do not use chemical inputs or do so in very low quantities they are still in rural areas and contribute to the preservation of human and environmental health thus export orientated organic farming has been advocated to suit traditional practices as the additional cost for compliance with the international standard was assumed to be low however poor farmers were still excluded from the global food supply chain for a range of reasons 11 in recent years standards development for locally oriented organic production systems has become one of the main policy objectives for governments ngos and farmers organizations due to the potential they represent for smallholder farmers through access to a higher value agricultural market 12 building on this point another strand of literature focuses on the implementation of the popular payment for ecosystem services pes scheme as a pragmatic approach to remunerating low income farmers for maintaining the ecological benefits of traditional cropping practices 13 the specific characteristics of ecosystem services i e pure public goods or pooled common resources would appear to call for some kind of government driven initiative however given the small proportion of public funds allocated to conservation programs in the developing world pes schemes based on market arrangements between farmers and consumers also need to be considered 14 15 this will aid in integrating public goods such as aquatic biodiversity in consumers purchasing decisions targeting the local urban market as the first market for ecosystem services ess remains a major policy challenge in developing countries a large proportion of local consumers are too poor to pay the price premium for certified products 16 furthermore the motivation of consumers to purchase organic foods in asian countries such as in thailand malaysia and vietnam derives from quality nutrition and health 17 18 the potential for local consumers to pay for ecosystem services has not yet been examined by either the empirical literature or current certification policies so far empirical research that addresses the extent to which specific ecosystem services delivered by rice cropping systems may influence preferences and shopping behavior of local urban consumers is absent from the literature this study addresses this research gap by investigating urban consumers preferences for rice attributes in cambodia with choice experiment method identifying ecosystem services to present to the consumer is therefore an essential step in achieving better market prices for those who produce their rice through traditional means the ecosystem services provided by rice cropping systems have only recently begun to attract the attention of researchers 19 these authors developed an expert based screening of ecosystem services for irrigated rice cropping systems in vietnam and the philippines our study adopts another pragmatic approach based on the french agrarian system approach 20 we developed a detailed analysis of rice cropping systems observed for tonle sape lake flood pulse which is the most productive ecosystem for rice cultivation in cambodia 21 22 to select ecosystem services associated to rice production systems that benefit the local consumer before building choice experiment scenarios the choice experiment survey was conducted in different places of sale in the city of phnom penh in early 2013 our application of the choice experiment differs from its application to value food product attributes which tended to rely on a survey protocol presenting different alternatives and the buy nothing scenario as an opt out format 23 25 for a basic foodstuff such as rice it is unrealistic to propose a scenario where if none of the situations proposed to the respondent is inappropriate to him her he she can opt to buy nothing therefore respondents are asked to choose between two alternative scenarios or continue to buy their current rice the choose my current brand size 26 moreover the application of the choice experiment method to investigate consumers preference for food products has been an object of strong criticism consumers wtp may be biased when their choices are elicited using pictures instead of real products and the survey protocol does not introduce any economic incentive to control for their commitment 27 recent applications of the ce to study food consumption behavior developing real payment devices using protocol drawn from experimental economics studies have initiated a lot of new researches in the lab and in the field 28 however real payment treatments have not been established we thus choose to develop the hypothetical version of the choice experiment then the values of wtp estimated with an econometric model that controls for attribute non attendance 29 30 are discussed for better understanding economic behavior underpinning consumer preferences for organic or near organic rice attributes the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the case study and explains the agrarian system approach used to quantify the water ecosystem services delivered by different rice cropping practices section 3 summarizes the data collection and the choice experiment design section 4 details the econometric modelling section 5 shows the results the last section contains discussion and concluding remarks 2 water ecosystem services and rice cropping in the tonle sape lake the tonle sap lake tsl is the largest fresh water lake of the mekong river basin and also the largest in southeast asia this part of the world is thus ideal for more traditional methods of rice growing the region is one of the most suitable agroecosystems for non irrigated rice cultivation thanks to increased soil fertility through sedimentation and an abundance of water however this kind of agro ecosystem also increases the risk of reduced yields caused by flooding improving water management through the construction of dykes and canals for rice terraces serves as an effective flood control solution in the region 31 the tsl and its floodplain act as a natural water flow regulator for the mekong river thus ensure water availability for dry season and receding rice cultivation in cambodia and vietnam 32 as the first biosphere reserve in cambodia this lake is also classed as one of the world s most productive wetland ecosystems 33 the flood pulse creates vast areas of seasonal floodplain that serve as habitats for birds and fish consequently intentional production of ecosystem services from rice cultivation in the agro ecosystems of this region requires an understanding of the trade offs between food provisioning with other multiple es supply 34 this study adopts the agrarian system analysis and diagnosis approach 20 this field methodology by exploring how agricultural practices interact with natural ecosystem components contributes to a better understanding of synergies between agricultural practices and ecosystem function as well as shedding light on the effects of specific land use and management on ecosystem services the approach is based on an all encompassing systemic approach capable of making sense of agricultural activities at different scale from the plot level to the regional level and in a way that accounts for both ecological and socio economic dimensions the method consists of gathering data on farmers decision for their specific plots land level of mechanization labor force and the ecological impacts of these decisions on the provision of ess as provided by the natural ecosystem at a larger spatial scale thus a typology approach is developed to group farms with the same cropping practices and to characterize their ability to deliver multiple ecosystem services for the case of tsl socio economic and ecological data were obtained from interviews with 208 farmers living in 2 districts steung sen srayove commune srayov tbong roka and rolous villages and santuk tbphanhagy ompus and porkhav villages in 2012 2013 from these data the tsl rice cropping techniques can be classified into main four types of rice cultivation systems which combine the cropping calendar rice varieties and technical production chosen by farmers for plots located on different areas of the flood pulse the first main cropping technique is called short term rice these systems were adopted sometime around the year 2000 with the aim of better protection against flash flooding during the rainy season short term rice cropping systems are called dry season rice by farmers these non seasonal and non photosensitive varieties enable farmers to produce outside of the flood period there are two different cropping calendars early seasoning rice and receding rice for which farmers wait until the water recedes to start re seeding some farmers combine two calendars on the same rice field enabling them to double their productivity water management is important for all of these calendars early seasoning rice calls for controlled irrigation while receding rice requires excellent drainage short term rice cultivation is obtained through the use of agro chemical inputs such as fertilizer and pesticides in addition herbicide use is becoming common practice in reduce plowing the second main technique is rainy season rice cropping these are traditional practices with seeds selected naturally and locally from one generation to another the scientific term for this seasonal rice is photoperiod sensitive rice varieties it is often fragrant rice with which farmers produce ambok rice grilled and flattened by crushing to sell to phnom penh at a national event water festival in november this main variety is called medium duration of maturity however long term maturity variety grows where there is less water during the early rainy season so that they can sow on muddy land direct seedlings are used more than transplanting for rainy season rice farmers may use pesticides to protect against crabs and rats and may add chemical fertilizer the third main cropping technique is organic rice organic rice or is also a rainy season rice organic rice is cultivated particularly on high land to avoid floods even from the natural flood pulse it has the same life cycle as other medium term rice systems because of the risk of flooding some farmers use only the suitable part of their land for organic rice cultivation and still continue to produce floating rice associated with long term or medium term rice on the rest of their land ecological constraints make it possible to produce only outside the floodplain area for the reason that the excessive flooding may cause chemical contamination and as an immediate consequence the loss of the organic label certification the last cropping technique is floating rice floating rice is normally a cropping system of rainy season rice but this study keeps it separate because it is particularly suited to deeper water many groups of floating rice fields have been converted to short term rice in the region the concept of ecosystem services refers to the biophysical components of ecosystems used by humans either actively or passively to improve their wellbeing to characterize the benefits associated with es the millennium ecosystem assessment framework 35 pinpoints different facets of human wellbeing a need for safety health living conditions social relationships and economic needs however transposing the ecosystem services framework to agro systems requires the identification of those ess flowing into agriculture and those flowing out 36 the valuation of ecosystem services by local markets can thus succeed for ecosystem services that may benefit urban consumers of rice foodstuffs and other fresh products table 1 summarizes the extent to which rice cropping system provides specific ecosystem service table a1 in the appendix details how farming practice and land use are interlinked with ecosystem functions and services as defined by the mea framework as obtained from our field survey and farmers interviews the results of table 1 show that none of the rice cultivation systems comply completely with the preservation of all ecosystem services except floating rice cultivation systems the immediate consequence of this is that differences in the ecosystem services provided by the different rice cultivation system imply a clear trade off the encouragement of traditional rice cropping or organic cropping as opposed to short term rice cropping for water quality and habitat for agro biodiversity preservation the encouragement of traditional rainy rice cropping as opposed to organic methods with regard to the cultivation of local variety for the conservation of rice varietal diversity and vice versa the encouragement of organic rice cropping in comparison with traditional rice cropping for flood protection market based incentives could be a helpful tool in ensuring the preservation of ecosystem services and increasing farmers income to this end it is important to identify the preference of local consumers for ecosystem services flows from these rice cropping systems to make payment mechanisms both credible and financially sustainable we therefore decided to value three ecosystem services that serve the nutrition security safety and health of consumers provision of water quality in the river provision of habitats for agro biodiversity and the protection of the agricultural landscape from flooding we consider the conservation of traditional rice variety as an ecosystem service provided by traditional rice cropping system rice based agricultural ecosystems are indeed an important support for cultural services in asian country 3 survey design and data collection 3 1 sampling method data were collected from a 2013 survey conducted in phnom penh which is the largest city and capital of cambodia with a population of 1 5 million in 2013 phnom penh was chosen for two reasons first phnom penh represents about 50 of the total urban population in the country second phnom penh city was host for most of new stores where labelled organic products are sold in cambodia however exploratory research generally uses purposeful conceptual sampling instead of random sampling so our sampling strategy was driven by the need to find different consumers from differing backgrounds and consumer purchasing habit rather than representativeness of the general population in statistical terms our survey design therefore focused initially on the inner center of the city of phnom penh the municipality of boeung keng kang where the upper and middle classes live we then moved south west toward stung mean chey municipalities where lower class people live we included all the three types of food distribution system such as traditional markets supermarkets and organic shops to cover the widest possible range of buying habits for different socio professional categories the surveys were conducted early and late in the day both during the working day and at the weekend the main survey consisted of face to face interviews conducted at traditional markets 41 of the sample supermarkets 10 of the sample and organic shops 39 of the sample the questionnaire made up of four sections the first part included questions about the respondent s socio economic and demographic status the second part contained questions about respondents perception on the environmental impact of agriculture practices and ecosystem services the third part consisted of questions about the respondents buying habits and those of their household including organic food the fourth section was the choice experiment itself 3 2 choice questionnaire respondents in our survey were asked to make choices between various specifications of rice product each product was described by an intrinsic quality attribute rice fragrance two extrinsic attributes the presence of a label or not that indicates the agricultural production method and targeted ecosystem service and the price variable two levels were used to depict the type of rice fragrant versus normal rice the label attribute distinguishes certified organic rice certified chemical free rice non certified chemical free rice and chemically grown rice as a reference the attribute for targeted ecosystem services is defined by four considerations the preservation of water quality and biodiversity of the river the conservation of flooded forests the preservation of local rice varieties or no specific ecosystem service the payment vehicle was expressed in price per kg this cost attribute obtained four different levels ranging from 3000 riels to 7000 riels the attributes and their levels are reported in table a2 in the appendix in order to decide exactly which combinations of attributes respondents should be asked to choose a fractional generation procedure using ngene software was used to form an orthogonal main effect design of scenarios the procedure has identified thirty six choice sets that were later split into three blocks each respondent was then faced with six choice tasks in each task respondents were told to examine two alternatives to choose between these alternatives or their current consumption table 2 depicts one of the choice sets situation presented to survey respondents 3 3 socio economic characteristics of survey participants the questionnaire was administered to 300 respondents after data clearing 295 individuals were included in the analysis the average age of respondents was 31 years old and 90 of them were under forty forty eight percent of respondents were the spouse of the head of household and 36 were the head of household forty six percent were women related to their education level 44 of people held a high school leaver s diploma this shows that our respondents were reasonably well educated people the result shows that the majority of head of household and respondent 90 are khmer and around 10 are foreigners coming from a western country chinese or other country the survey reveals that 67 of respondents declare consuming regularly or occasionally certified organic products including rice that they buy from the different branches of cedac center for study and development in agriculture shops only 33 stated that they never consumed any certified organic products among people who recognised organic labels 51 stated that they knew cedac labels fair trade and organic certified agricultural products in contrast only 2 stated that they knew the cambodian organic agriculture association coraa label which is the national certification body also responsible for certifying organic products sold in cedac shops the preservation of health was quoted by 95 of the sample as the main motivation for consuming organic products followed by food quality sixty six percent of those surveyed stated that they consumed organic products because they are locally produced food 53 stated that they consumed organic products because they found it tastier than non organic food approximately half of respondents stated that they consumed organic food to support farmers income finally 48 of those surveyed stated that they consumed organic products to preserve the natural environment among respondents who had never tried organic foods 54 stated that they did not consume organic products because they did not know where to buy them 3 4 choice data quality each respondent completed 6 choice tasks with each task including three choice scenarios resulting in 1770 observations for the 295 people retained for the analysis in the ce 40 respondents 14 always chose to stay with their existing rice in order to better understand possible reasons for opting for status quo scenarios the participants complete an open follow up question after each choice task we did not observe any signs of protest answers for such choices only two respondents mentioned the price the rest of the respondents gave arguments related to the taste and quality of their current rice out of all the respondents who selected alternative rice scenarios 131 44 never chose their current rice 4 econometric modelling framework choice experiment has its theoretical foundation in lancaster s multi attribute utility theory and mcfadden s random utility model it is now usual to formulate that the benefit provided to an individual i for the choice of scenario j j 1 2 3 between multiple alternatives of a choice set n n 1 2 6 is a function of the level of the scenarios attributes and a random term thus the utility function of the respondent can be expressed as follows 1 u i j n α j β x j n ε i j n where the parameter α j represents the specific constant for alternative j the vector x j corresponds to the levels of scenarios attributes the values of x j are set to zero for the status quo alternative choose my own rice the vector β represents parameters to be estimated and ε is the stochastic element when faced with different alternatives the respondent is assumed to select the alternative that gives him or her highest level of utility the probability π that an individual i chooses alternative j from the choice set n is then given by the following decision 2 π i j n pr α j β x jn ε i j n α k β x kn ε i k n j k j 1 2 3 the conditional logit model is the first candidate to estimate the choice probabilities in equation 2 assuming that the error terms ε are independently and identically distributed iid and follow the gumbel distribution the probability that alternative j would be chosen from choice set n n 1 2 6 is calculated with the following equation 3 π i j n exp β x j n j 1 2 3 exp β x j n each scenario alternative may have four major effects on an individual utility a quality effect with respect to rice fragrance the guarantee of health effect through the elimination of pesticide residues on food from agricultural methods and their certification and an environmental effect from ecosystem service provided by rice cultivation system however local consumers in developing countries have a very limited budget which may complicate their purchasing decision and ability to make trade offs between the several characteristics of organically grown rice and its price through the choice processes several studies give proof for lower price sensitivity of organic products demand 37 furthermore some studies get out the idea that households in developing countries are more reluctant to pay for environmental protection because they are not willing to reduce their private spending to finance a public good 38 from these we can derive the suggestion that some respondents may ignore the price to make their choice applying stated preference techniques in order to capture the value that individuals place on biodiversity and ecosystem preservation has raised intensive debate 39 respondents are supposed to make their choice based on their prior knowledge however if the individuals taking part in the study are not sufficiently well informed about the benefits of protecting the environment they will underestimate the importance of preservation programmes consequently when the abstract nature of ecosystem services could be an obstacle to widespread understanding and recognition of the benefit of specific ecosystem service preservation particularly if there are low levels of literacy 40 we cannot exclude the fact that some respondents may also ignore the environmental attributes during the choice experiment survey choosing the appropriate econometric method estimation to deal with attribute non attendance in choice experiment requires clarification of the sources of the phenomenon 41 in our case such behavior may reflect well theoretically founded phenomenon maximization of utility subject to budget constraint as well as the heterogeneity of decision process making of respondents regarding the choice task and its cognitive complexity thus in a similar fashion to hole 30 we developed an endogenous attribute attendance eaa model to process choice probabilities the decision making process thus followed a two step process whereby the respondent first decides which attributes to take into account when comparing the available alternatives including his her own rice then he she chooses the preferred alternative conditional of the set of attributes chosen in stage one the eaa is equivalent to the equality constrained latent class analysis developed by scarpa et al 29 for an inferred approach to ana the main advantage of eaa over this approach is that all possible attributes subset can be examined by the model to be more precise when faced with a total of l l 4 attributes for each alternative the respondent will choose a subset of attributes c s l to take into account when valuing an alternative c s l λ s z i ζ i s where z i is the vector of observed individual socioeconomic characteristics λs is a vector of parameters to be estimated and ζis is the error terms the total number of subset of attributes s is 16 for our case the probability that individual i opted for c s l is given by the following equation 5 c i s l exp λ s z i s 1 16 exp λ s z i then if we assume the existence of ana behavior within our population the utility function presented by equation 1 and probability choice formulated in equation 3 have to be rewritten to account for the fact that an individual i derives its utility from the choice of alternative j based on the choice of subset of attributes he she makes at the first stage the expressions of these two equations are now u i j n s c s l α j β s x j n s ε i j n s and π i j n s c s l exp β s x j n s j 1 2 3 exp β s x j n s the unconditional probability of the observed sequence of choices for the n n 1 2 6 choice sets is now 6 p i n s 1 16 n 1 6 π i j n s c i s l the module eaalogit implemented also by hole 30 to perform an estimation of parameters of equation 6 by maximum likelihood procedure then we compare the results of the eaalogit model to the estimation latent class logit model to find out how attribute non attendance in this choice experiment study may manifest within such classical approach 5 econometric estimations and results 5 1 the eaa logit model the empirical analysis is thus based on the estimation of equation 6 by maximum likelihood we elected to use effect coded dummy variable to define the value of all non monetary attributes this allows us for nonlinear effects of attribute levels on utility the price per kilo is proposed as a continuous variable the individual utility function thus includes eight variables for attribute levels and an alternative specific constant for opt out attribute attendance probability was supposed to be affected by two main individual characteristics household income and education attainment of respondent a first estimation of a conditional logit choice with endogenous attribute attendance eealogit indicates that the probability of attribute attendance is not influenced by respondent characteristics it was found that neither the educational attainments of respondents nor their household income or instead households size had any effects on the probability of considering a given attribute these results direct us toward a different interpretation of the factors behind the ana in this study since respondents who show ana behavior cannot be represented by their observable characteristics it cannot be ruled out that non attender respondents choose to focus on one attribute over another for many other unknown reasons 42 we thus estimated another version of our eealogit model for which no explanatory variable appears in the attribute attendance probability equation except a constant term and an error term the results of this estimation are shown in table 3 column 2 and 3 we also estimated a version of the eaa logit model which accounted for the fact that individual characteristics may affect preferences for opt out option initially a set of socio economic variables were included one by one age of the respondent household size educational attainments income level actual organic consumer in the utility function through interaction terms with the dummy code for opt out scenario these interactions terms were not significant in the model except for the indicator variable for actual organic consumer based on the aic and the bic we consider that the eealogit specification was this last model table 3 column 4 and 5 reports the predicted attribute probability non attendance based on the last estimation of the eealogit model it can be seen from these results that a substantial share of respondents about 61 of the sample ignored the price attribute the proportion of respondents taking price into account must be borne in mind when quantifying and interpreting the willingness to pay wtp estimates and interpretation all respondents were assumed to have attended to fragrant attribute to make their choice it is not a surprise that only 4 of respondents ignore the label attribute as a large proportion 67 of those surveyed stated that they had experience of organic food the attribute for targeted ecosystem services was also considered more frequently but still ignored by 17 of respondents table 3 column 4 presents the utility function the opt out option is associated to a positive and significant coefficient meaning that the majority of respondents prefer their actual rice however organic consumers are willing to pay for alternative rice qualities as expected the parameter estimate on the variable price is negative and significant indicating that an increase in the price of a rice product entailed a reduced utility level the quality of the rice was positive and statistically significant only at p value set at 10 meaning that the majority of the respondents are quite indifferent between fragrant and normal rice all three variables indicating that the agricultural production method was chemical free were positive and significant indicating that safer products do indeed increase utility rice grown with organic production methods provides the highest utility followed by rice grown without chemical use either the production method was certified chemical free or not environmental attributes also have significant and positive impact on the consumer s utility 5 2 the latent class model the latent class model allows individuals to be grouped into relatively homogeneous classes of preference i e individuals who belong to the same class exhibit identical choice behavior the model estimates the membership probability in each class and the utility functions specific to each class thus we can assume the existence of classes of preferences within our population according to individual perception of the attributes and the possibility of similar attribute non attendance strategies we thus expect one or more classes for which the coefficient of price attribute and attribute variables describing ecosystem services to be equal to zero the first step of the econometric procedure for the latent class approach of choice probability corresponds to the estimation of class membership function in order to determine the optimal number of classes with three attributes we tested 2 to 5 class solutions where the probability model for class selection did not include any socio economic variables as factor of class membership they are not significant and were removed from the model we used the most used criteria to determine the number of classes the minimum bayesian information criterion bic these statistics support three classes as the optimal solution test results for different number of classes are provided in the appendix a3 the choice equation has thus to be constructed according to three classes of preferences the econometric estimation of the choice equation with the same set of explanatory factors as for the eaalogit model provides differentiated parameters for each class the results of estimation are displayed in table 4 class 1 represents 24 of respondents class 2 represents 59 of the sample and class 3 accounts for 17 of the sample we observed that for all three classes of preferences the coefficients associated with the price attribute are negative and significant and we found important contrast between the estimated value for class 2 and coefficient estimates for class 1 and 3 the value of the coefficient is ten times lower indicating individuals whose choices are grouped in class 2 have a totally different preference for this attribute class two merge individuals who may perceive the price attribute much larger we cannot exclude the fact that class 2 will merge respondents who could be considered as non attenders or more precisely low attenders for price with eaalogit model contrary to hensher et al 2012 42 we believe that the situation of limited budget in developing country may lead respondents to perceive price attribute levels too high in such a way that only price levels below a certain amount are taken into consideration we also find out that only in class 3 that coefficient estimates for labelling attribute levels are statistically non significant however these results could not be interpreted as attribute non attendance such behavior was not detected by our eaalogit estimation they may indicate that class 3 merge individuals who are not sensitive to labelling attribute furthermore preservation of flooded forest was not valued at all in this group of respondents suggesting that these respondents were not sensitive to this attribute when faced with rice quality scenarios having this attribute level for ecosystem services the coefficient of the interaction term between opt out option and indicator variable for actual organic consumer is positive and statistically significant meaning that organic consumers perceive higher benefit when choosing to stay with their actual rice compared to proposed alternative rice qualities this is in contrast to the reported result in class 1 choice equation 5 3 marginal wtp estimates our objective for this study was not to identify the participants ideal rice product but to assess their willingness to pay wtp for different attributes that can define traditionally grown rice compared with standard rice grown with chemical fertilizer pesticides first of all we find that 40 of the respondent has a positive wtp in this study since they attend the price attribute this does not mean that the remaining 60 who have neglected the price does not value the attributes considered but as part of this investigation they have not considered the price to make their choice the distribution of wtp shown in table 5 only concerns those who considered the price level to make their choice the results presented in column 2 and 3 correspond to estimated wtp values inferred from the parameters of the eaalogit model while the wtp estimates inferred from the two estimations are not comparable table 5 column 4 to 7 also provides distribution of wtp values inferred from parameters of class 1 and class 3 choice equations of the latent logit model it is worth noting that the wtp estimates for the two classes differ since each model is subject to different individual preferences and attribute attendance behavior based on the eaalogit model which provides a better fit for the overall choice model the mean value of the willingness to pay for organic certified grown rice compared with standard rice grown with chemical fertilizer and use of pesticide is 3587riels kg with a standard deviation of 1343riels kg this value seems reasonable currently the price differential between normal white rice phakchney and organic certified grown rice is about 1000riels kg labels play the role of signal for the consumer and help them assess product quality that can positively affect their utility 43 as such certification procedures are important because they affect confidence of consumer on the label that have to differentiate production methods in this study it appears that individuals do not make difference between organic label and free chemical label which is valued about 3261riels kg finally they less value a rice product without chemistry but not necessarily one which is certified with a price premium of 1988riels per kilo the results also show that the preservation of the quality of rivers and their biodiversity wins the support of consumers over 83 of respondents gave importance to ecosystem service attributes the mean values of the wtp to maintain the se by rice cultivation of those who take into consideration price are 2138riels kg for water and biodiversity the 2488riels kg for the preservation of flooded forests for protection against flooding and 1950 riels kg for the conservation of local variety 6 discussion and conclusion the choice experiment we used provided respondents with an environment that is more comparable to a real shopping experience where a consumer can decide between different options or not to buy their normal product our results suggest that consumers are willing to pay more for rice produced using chemical free methods in addition our respondents value the certified organic certified grown rice over certified rice grown using chemical free methods furthermore the price premium currently charged for organic rice is higher than the price premium as observed in the local market organic rice sells for a premium price mainly because the production processing procurement and distribution costs are higher than for rice produced using conventional methods the niche market situation supply lower than demand of organic food products may also lead to higher prices higher wtp value than the price premium in the market indicates that the consumer is willing to pay an additional premium price since they perceive it as healthier and of better quality 44 another major aspect of this study is that consumers express additional values for the preservation of biodiversity and river water quality ecosystem services related to rice cultivation systems environmental protection activities that also benefit other citizens get the same support from consumers as their healthiness counterpart conveyed by the presence of an organic label this is in contrast to other major studies findings which conclude that the purchase of organic products is mainly motivated by self interested concerns relating to health quality and taste rather than ecological concerns relating to the environment durham et al 45 is one exception to this however their results concern people living in developed countries this last result is particularly important when considering that those who reported eating organic products in cambodia are motivated more by preserving their health than by protecting the natural environment this shows that there is a demand for water quality in rivers to be protected along with aquatic species in addition residents of large cities are willing to pay higher price premiums to support production methods that promote these specific public goods as ecosystem services the wtp values obtained by this exploratory study thus represent new figures for an organic rice product targeting the local market the organic certification has been promoted by national governments ngos or international institutions these different actors see in this tool a means to reduce rural poverty by using the price premium promised by the niche market of organic food 46 however the development of certified organic farming which targets the local market faces both organizational and ecological constraints organic practices are often the best solution for poor farmers because no additional funding is required to buy additional inputs however low yield associated with this organic technique compared to conventional ones 47 dissuade farmers from adopting such practices this economic argument is reinforced by ecological constraints for the case of rice cultivation in the tsl on which the agrarian analysis of this study is based natural flooding is the main ingredient for organic rice production however chemical contamination of a rice field in the event of flash floods can result in the immediate loss of the organic label faced with this risk farmers opt to sell their rice on the local market without using the marketing network of certified products the results of this study open new perspectives on two fronts firstly rice cultivation systems that preserve the quality of rivers and habitats for agro biodiversity need to benefit from a price premium a proportion of urban consumers are willing to contribute to the preservation of this ecosystem service whether they are already organic consumers or not organic certification is still very selective the challenge for market based environmental policy instruments in this specific case of rice cultivation is thus to find innovative certification strategy that generates win win win solutions 48 optimize anticipated price premiums for farmers foster consumer confidence in the health and nutritional benefits of rice products and preserve ecosystem functions and services the attribute attendance issue is one of the hottest theoretical and empirical topics being currently opened by economic valuation in the case of payment for ecosystem services in the developing world the results of the exploratory analysis in this study confirm that choice experiment application to this subject area should take into consideration non attendance behavior however questions related to protocol surveys and the best econometric methods to capture such behavior are still relatively unanswered 49 appendixes table a 1

8712,within south east asia certification and local market development may play an important role in incentivizing farmers to continue with nature based solutions delivered by organic or traditional farming practices and avoid using environmentally detrimental production techniques the purpose of this study is to use economic valuation in order to achieve an empirical understanding of local consumer preferences for different attributes of rice products application of the agrarian system approach reveals that rice cultivation systems observed in the tonle sape lake of the mekong river basin in cambodia our study case may target three ecosystem services that present the characteristics of public goods and may benefit consumer support a choice experiment survey was administered among local consumers in the city of phnom penh in 2013 econometric analysis indicates high rate of non attendance for the price attribute it also suggests that 17 of the respondents made their choices neglecting attributes describing ecosystem services however there are evidence of consumers willingness to pay wtp for certified organic rice higher than the price premium observed on the local market furthermore there is additional wtp value for the preservation of ecosystem services we discuss the implications of our findings on potential payment for ecosystem services in the specific case of rice 1 introduction for many countries in southeast asia implementation of new varieties high application of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to boost agricultural productivity 1 remain a major feature of agricultural practices aimed at ensuring future food security for local populations and helping farmers work their way out of poverty 2 3 however for many regions intensive farming practices have implications for the structure and functions of ecosystems which may alter the resilience of agro ecosystems and the well being of poor farmers who rely more directly on ecosystem functions and services 4 this is notably the case for rice production in cambodia the country was not part of the green revolution initiated in the 1960 s by other countries and maintained its own traditional practices of agriculture until joining the asean free trade area in 1999 to satisfy national export targets the agricultural sector is oriented towards an intensive model involving chemical inputs irrigation and only 10 selected high yield varieties of rice given that the majority of cambodia s rice is grown within the floodplain of tonle sap lake 5 6 these practices pose a risk to water quality agro chemical residues threaten food security and public health as a large part of the urban and rural population rely on rice field species rats and snails insects frogs snakes as well as a lot of other inland aquatic species as important sources of proteins 7 8 a large body of the literature argues that developing organic farming labelling could be a solution to resolving environmental problems in agro ecosystems thus improving the livelihood of rural people and helping to meet the demand for safe food for consumers 9 10 traditional agricultural practices are also organic by default or near organic as they do not use chemical inputs or do so in very low quantities they are still in rural areas and contribute to the preservation of human and environmental health thus export orientated organic farming has been advocated to suit traditional practices as the additional cost for compliance with the international standard was assumed to be low however poor farmers were still excluded from the global food supply chain for a range of reasons 11 in recent years standards development for locally oriented organic production systems has become one of the main policy objectives for governments ngos and farmers organizations due to the potential they represent for smallholder farmers through access to a higher value agricultural market 12 building on this point another strand of literature focuses on the implementation of the popular payment for ecosystem services pes scheme as a pragmatic approach to remunerating low income farmers for maintaining the ecological benefits of traditional cropping practices 13 the specific characteristics of ecosystem services i e pure public goods or pooled common resources would appear to call for some kind of government driven initiative however given the small proportion of public funds allocated to conservation programs in the developing world pes schemes based on market arrangements between farmers and consumers also need to be considered 14 15 this will aid in integrating public goods such as aquatic biodiversity in consumers purchasing decisions targeting the local urban market as the first market for ecosystem services ess remains a major policy challenge in developing countries a large proportion of local consumers are too poor to pay the price premium for certified products 16 furthermore the motivation of consumers to purchase organic foods in asian countries such as in thailand malaysia and vietnam derives from quality nutrition and health 17 18 the potential for local consumers to pay for ecosystem services has not yet been examined by either the empirical literature or current certification policies so far empirical research that addresses the extent to which specific ecosystem services delivered by rice cropping systems may influence preferences and shopping behavior of local urban consumers is absent from the literature this study addresses this research gap by investigating urban consumers preferences for rice attributes in cambodia with choice experiment method identifying ecosystem services to present to the consumer is therefore an essential step in achieving better market prices for those who produce their rice through traditional means the ecosystem services provided by rice cropping systems have only recently begun to attract the attention of researchers 19 these authors developed an expert based screening of ecosystem services for irrigated rice cropping systems in vietnam and the philippines our study adopts another pragmatic approach based on the french agrarian system approach 20 we developed a detailed analysis of rice cropping systems observed for tonle sape lake flood pulse which is the most productive ecosystem for rice cultivation in cambodia 21 22 to select ecosystem services associated to rice production systems that benefit the local consumer before building choice experiment scenarios the choice experiment survey was conducted in different places of sale in the city of phnom penh in early 2013 our application of the choice experiment differs from its application to value food product attributes which tended to rely on a survey protocol presenting different alternatives and the buy nothing scenario as an opt out format 23 25 for a basic foodstuff such as rice it is unrealistic to propose a scenario where if none of the situations proposed to the respondent is inappropriate to him her he she can opt to buy nothing therefore respondents are asked to choose between two alternative scenarios or continue to buy their current rice the choose my current brand size 26 moreover the application of the choice experiment method to investigate consumers preference for food products has been an object of strong criticism consumers wtp may be biased when their choices are elicited using pictures instead of real products and the survey protocol does not introduce any economic incentive to control for their commitment 27 recent applications of the ce to study food consumption behavior developing real payment devices using protocol drawn from experimental economics studies have initiated a lot of new researches in the lab and in the field 28 however real payment treatments have not been established we thus choose to develop the hypothetical version of the choice experiment then the values of wtp estimated with an econometric model that controls for attribute non attendance 29 30 are discussed for better understanding economic behavior underpinning consumer preferences for organic or near organic rice attributes the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the case study and explains the agrarian system approach used to quantify the water ecosystem services delivered by different rice cropping practices section 3 summarizes the data collection and the choice experiment design section 4 details the econometric modelling section 5 shows the results the last section contains discussion and concluding remarks 2 water ecosystem services and rice cropping in the tonle sape lake the tonle sap lake tsl is the largest fresh water lake of the mekong river basin and also the largest in southeast asia this part of the world is thus ideal for more traditional methods of rice growing the region is one of the most suitable agroecosystems for non irrigated rice cultivation thanks to increased soil fertility through sedimentation and an abundance of water however this kind of agro ecosystem also increases the risk of reduced yields caused by flooding improving water management through the construction of dykes and canals for rice terraces serves as an effective flood control solution in the region 31 the tsl and its floodplain act as a natural water flow regulator for the mekong river thus ensure water availability for dry season and receding rice cultivation in cambodia and vietnam 32 as the first biosphere reserve in cambodia this lake is also classed as one of the world s most productive wetland ecosystems 33 the flood pulse creates vast areas of seasonal floodplain that serve as habitats for birds and fish consequently intentional production of ecosystem services from rice cultivation in the agro ecosystems of this region requires an understanding of the trade offs between food provisioning with other multiple es supply 34 this study adopts the agrarian system analysis and diagnosis approach 20 this field methodology by exploring how agricultural practices interact with natural ecosystem components contributes to a better understanding of synergies between agricultural practices and ecosystem function as well as shedding light on the effects of specific land use and management on ecosystem services the approach is based on an all encompassing systemic approach capable of making sense of agricultural activities at different scale from the plot level to the regional level and in a way that accounts for both ecological and socio economic dimensions the method consists of gathering data on farmers decision for their specific plots land level of mechanization labor force and the ecological impacts of these decisions on the provision of ess as provided by the natural ecosystem at a larger spatial scale thus a typology approach is developed to group farms with the same cropping practices and to characterize their ability to deliver multiple ecosystem services for the case of tsl socio economic and ecological data were obtained from interviews with 208 farmers living in 2 districts steung sen srayove commune srayov tbong roka and rolous villages and santuk tbphanhagy ompus and porkhav villages in 2012 2013 from these data the tsl rice cropping techniques can be classified into main four types of rice cultivation systems which combine the cropping calendar rice varieties and technical production chosen by farmers for plots located on different areas of the flood pulse the first main cropping technique is called short term rice these systems were adopted sometime around the year 2000 with the aim of better protection against flash flooding during the rainy season short term rice cropping systems are called dry season rice by farmers these non seasonal and non photosensitive varieties enable farmers to produce outside of the flood period there are two different cropping calendars early seasoning rice and receding rice for which farmers wait until the water recedes to start re seeding some farmers combine two calendars on the same rice field enabling them to double their productivity water management is important for all of these calendars early seasoning rice calls for controlled irrigation while receding rice requires excellent drainage short term rice cultivation is obtained through the use of agro chemical inputs such as fertilizer and pesticides in addition herbicide use is becoming common practice in reduce plowing the second main technique is rainy season rice cropping these are traditional practices with seeds selected naturally and locally from one generation to another the scientific term for this seasonal rice is photoperiod sensitive rice varieties it is often fragrant rice with which farmers produce ambok rice grilled and flattened by crushing to sell to phnom penh at a national event water festival in november this main variety is called medium duration of maturity however long term maturity variety grows where there is less water during the early rainy season so that they can sow on muddy land direct seedlings are used more than transplanting for rainy season rice farmers may use pesticides to protect against crabs and rats and may add chemical fertilizer the third main cropping technique is organic rice organic rice or is also a rainy season rice organic rice is cultivated particularly on high land to avoid floods even from the natural flood pulse it has the same life cycle as other medium term rice systems because of the risk of flooding some farmers use only the suitable part of their land for organic rice cultivation and still continue to produce floating rice associated with long term or medium term rice on the rest of their land ecological constraints make it possible to produce only outside the floodplain area for the reason that the excessive flooding may cause chemical contamination and as an immediate consequence the loss of the organic label certification the last cropping technique is floating rice floating rice is normally a cropping system of rainy season rice but this study keeps it separate because it is particularly suited to deeper water many groups of floating rice fields have been converted to short term rice in the region the concept of ecosystem services refers to the biophysical components of ecosystems used by humans either actively or passively to improve their wellbeing to characterize the benefits associated with es the millennium ecosystem assessment framework 35 pinpoints different facets of human wellbeing a need for safety health living conditions social relationships and economic needs however transposing the ecosystem services framework to agro systems requires the identification of those ess flowing into agriculture and those flowing out 36 the valuation of ecosystem services by local markets can thus succeed for ecosystem services that may benefit urban consumers of rice foodstuffs and other fresh products table 1 summarizes the extent to which rice cropping system provides specific ecosystem service table a1 in the appendix details how farming practice and land use are interlinked with ecosystem functions and services as defined by the mea framework as obtained from our field survey and farmers interviews the results of table 1 show that none of the rice cultivation systems comply completely with the preservation of all ecosystem services except floating rice cultivation systems the immediate consequence of this is that differences in the ecosystem services provided by the different rice cultivation system imply a clear trade off the encouragement of traditional rice cropping or organic cropping as opposed to short term rice cropping for water quality and habitat for agro biodiversity preservation the encouragement of traditional rainy rice cropping as opposed to organic methods with regard to the cultivation of local variety for the conservation of rice varietal diversity and vice versa the encouragement of organic rice cropping in comparison with traditional rice cropping for flood protection market based incentives could be a helpful tool in ensuring the preservation of ecosystem services and increasing farmers income to this end it is important to identify the preference of local consumers for ecosystem services flows from these rice cropping systems to make payment mechanisms both credible and financially sustainable we therefore decided to value three ecosystem services that serve the nutrition security safety and health of consumers provision of water quality in the river provision of habitats for agro biodiversity and the protection of the agricultural landscape from flooding we consider the conservation of traditional rice variety as an ecosystem service provided by traditional rice cropping system rice based agricultural ecosystems are indeed an important support for cultural services in asian country 3 survey design and data collection 3 1 sampling method data were collected from a 2013 survey conducted in phnom penh which is the largest city and capital of cambodia with a population of 1 5 million in 2013 phnom penh was chosen for two reasons first phnom penh represents about 50 of the total urban population in the country second phnom penh city was host for most of new stores where labelled organic products are sold in cambodia however exploratory research generally uses purposeful conceptual sampling instead of random sampling so our sampling strategy was driven by the need to find different consumers from differing backgrounds and consumer purchasing habit rather than representativeness of the general population in statistical terms our survey design therefore focused initially on the inner center of the city of phnom penh the municipality of boeung keng kang where the upper and middle classes live we then moved south west toward stung mean chey municipalities where lower class people live we included all the three types of food distribution system such as traditional markets supermarkets and organic shops to cover the widest possible range of buying habits for different socio professional categories the surveys were conducted early and late in the day both during the working day and at the weekend the main survey consisted of face to face interviews conducted at traditional markets 41 of the sample supermarkets 10 of the sample and organic shops 39 of the sample the questionnaire made up of four sections the first part included questions about the respondent s socio economic and demographic status the second part contained questions about respondents perception on the environmental impact of agriculture practices and ecosystem services the third part consisted of questions about the respondents buying habits and those of their household including organic food the fourth section was the choice experiment itself 3 2 choice questionnaire respondents in our survey were asked to make choices between various specifications of rice product each product was described by an intrinsic quality attribute rice fragrance two extrinsic attributes the presence of a label or not that indicates the agricultural production method and targeted ecosystem service and the price variable two levels were used to depict the type of rice fragrant versus normal rice the label attribute distinguishes certified organic rice certified chemical free rice non certified chemical free rice and chemically grown rice as a reference the attribute for targeted ecosystem services is defined by four considerations the preservation of water quality and biodiversity of the river the conservation of flooded forests the preservation of local rice varieties or no specific ecosystem service the payment vehicle was expressed in price per kg this cost attribute obtained four different levels ranging from 3000 riels to 7000 riels the attributes and their levels are reported in table a2 in the appendix in order to decide exactly which combinations of attributes respondents should be asked to choose a fractional generation procedure using ngene software was used to form an orthogonal main effect design of scenarios the procedure has identified thirty six choice sets that were later split into three blocks each respondent was then faced with six choice tasks in each task respondents were told to examine two alternatives to choose between these alternatives or their current consumption table 2 depicts one of the choice sets situation presented to survey respondents 3 3 socio economic characteristics of survey participants the questionnaire was administered to 300 respondents after data clearing 295 individuals were included in the analysis the average age of respondents was 31 years old and 90 of them were under forty forty eight percent of respondents were the spouse of the head of household and 36 were the head of household forty six percent were women related to their education level 44 of people held a high school leaver s diploma this shows that our respondents were reasonably well educated people the result shows that the majority of head of household and respondent 90 are khmer and around 10 are foreigners coming from a western country chinese or other country the survey reveals that 67 of respondents declare consuming regularly or occasionally certified organic products including rice that they buy from the different branches of cedac center for study and development in agriculture shops only 33 stated that they never consumed any certified organic products among people who recognised organic labels 51 stated that they knew cedac labels fair trade and organic certified agricultural products in contrast only 2 stated that they knew the cambodian organic agriculture association coraa label which is the national certification body also responsible for certifying organic products sold in cedac shops the preservation of health was quoted by 95 of the sample as the main motivation for consuming organic products followed by food quality sixty six percent of those surveyed stated that they consumed organic products because they are locally produced food 53 stated that they consumed organic products because they found it tastier than non organic food approximately half of respondents stated that they consumed organic food to support farmers income finally 48 of those surveyed stated that they consumed organic products to preserve the natural environment among respondents who had never tried organic foods 54 stated that they did not consume organic products because they did not know where to buy them 3 4 choice data quality each respondent completed 6 choice tasks with each task including three choice scenarios resulting in 1770 observations for the 295 people retained for the analysis in the ce 40 respondents 14 always chose to stay with their existing rice in order to better understand possible reasons for opting for status quo scenarios the participants complete an open follow up question after each choice task we did not observe any signs of protest answers for such choices only two respondents mentioned the price the rest of the respondents gave arguments related to the taste and quality of their current rice out of all the respondents who selected alternative rice scenarios 131 44 never chose their current rice 4 econometric modelling framework choice experiment has its theoretical foundation in lancaster s multi attribute utility theory and mcfadden s random utility model it is now usual to formulate that the benefit provided to an individual i for the choice of scenario j j 1 2 3 between multiple alternatives of a choice set n n 1 2 6 is a function of the level of the scenarios attributes and a random term thus the utility function of the respondent can be expressed as follows 1 u i j n α j β x j n ε i j n where the parameter α j represents the specific constant for alternative j the vector x j corresponds to the levels of scenarios attributes the values of x j are set to zero for the status quo alternative choose my own rice the vector β represents parameters to be estimated and ε is the stochastic element when faced with different alternatives the respondent is assumed to select the alternative that gives him or her highest level of utility the probability π that an individual i chooses alternative j from the choice set n is then given by the following decision 2 π i j n pr α j β x jn ε i j n α k β x kn ε i k n j k j 1 2 3 the conditional logit model is the first candidate to estimate the choice probabilities in equation 2 assuming that the error terms ε are independently and identically distributed iid and follow the gumbel distribution the probability that alternative j would be chosen from choice set n n 1 2 6 is calculated with the following equation 3 π i j n exp β x j n j 1 2 3 exp β x j n each scenario alternative may have four major effects on an individual utility a quality effect with respect to rice fragrance the guarantee of health effect through the elimination of pesticide residues on food from agricultural methods and their certification and an environmental effect from ecosystem service provided by rice cultivation system however local consumers in developing countries have a very limited budget which may complicate their purchasing decision and ability to make trade offs between the several characteristics of organically grown rice and its price through the choice processes several studies give proof for lower price sensitivity of organic products demand 37 furthermore some studies get out the idea that households in developing countries are more reluctant to pay for environmental protection because they are not willing to reduce their private spending to finance a public good 38 from these we can derive the suggestion that some respondents may ignore the price to make their choice applying stated preference techniques in order to capture the value that individuals place on biodiversity and ecosystem preservation has raised intensive debate 39 respondents are supposed to make their choice based on their prior knowledge however if the individuals taking part in the study are not sufficiently well informed about the benefits of protecting the environment they will underestimate the importance of preservation programmes consequently when the abstract nature of ecosystem services could be an obstacle to widespread understanding and recognition of the benefit of specific ecosystem service preservation particularly if there are low levels of literacy 40 we cannot exclude the fact that some respondents may also ignore the environmental attributes during the choice experiment survey choosing the appropriate econometric method estimation to deal with attribute non attendance in choice experiment requires clarification of the sources of the phenomenon 41 in our case such behavior may reflect well theoretically founded phenomenon maximization of utility subject to budget constraint as well as the heterogeneity of decision process making of respondents regarding the choice task and its cognitive complexity thus in a similar fashion to hole 30 we developed an endogenous attribute attendance eaa model to process choice probabilities the decision making process thus followed a two step process whereby the respondent first decides which attributes to take into account when comparing the available alternatives including his her own rice then he she chooses the preferred alternative conditional of the set of attributes chosen in stage one the eaa is equivalent to the equality constrained latent class analysis developed by scarpa et al 29 for an inferred approach to ana the main advantage of eaa over this approach is that all possible attributes subset can be examined by the model to be more precise when faced with a total of l l 4 attributes for each alternative the respondent will choose a subset of attributes c s l to take into account when valuing an alternative c s l λ s z i ζ i s where z i is the vector of observed individual socioeconomic characteristics λs is a vector of parameters to be estimated and ζis is the error terms the total number of subset of attributes s is 16 for our case the probability that individual i opted for c s l is given by the following equation 5 c i s l exp λ s z i s 1 16 exp λ s z i then if we assume the existence of ana behavior within our population the utility function presented by equation 1 and probability choice formulated in equation 3 have to be rewritten to account for the fact that an individual i derives its utility from the choice of alternative j based on the choice of subset of attributes he she makes at the first stage the expressions of these two equations are now u i j n s c s l α j β s x j n s ε i j n s and π i j n s c s l exp β s x j n s j 1 2 3 exp β s x j n s the unconditional probability of the observed sequence of choices for the n n 1 2 6 choice sets is now 6 p i n s 1 16 n 1 6 π i j n s c i s l the module eaalogit implemented also by hole 30 to perform an estimation of parameters of equation 6 by maximum likelihood procedure then we compare the results of the eaalogit model to the estimation latent class logit model to find out how attribute non attendance in this choice experiment study may manifest within such classical approach 5 econometric estimations and results 5 1 the eaa logit model the empirical analysis is thus based on the estimation of equation 6 by maximum likelihood we elected to use effect coded dummy variable to define the value of all non monetary attributes this allows us for nonlinear effects of attribute levels on utility the price per kilo is proposed as a continuous variable the individual utility function thus includes eight variables for attribute levels and an alternative specific constant for opt out attribute attendance probability was supposed to be affected by two main individual characteristics household income and education attainment of respondent a first estimation of a conditional logit choice with endogenous attribute attendance eealogit indicates that the probability of attribute attendance is not influenced by respondent characteristics it was found that neither the educational attainments of respondents nor their household income or instead households size had any effects on the probability of considering a given attribute these results direct us toward a different interpretation of the factors behind the ana in this study since respondents who show ana behavior cannot be represented by their observable characteristics it cannot be ruled out that non attender respondents choose to focus on one attribute over another for many other unknown reasons 42 we thus estimated another version of our eealogit model for which no explanatory variable appears in the attribute attendance probability equation except a constant term and an error term the results of this estimation are shown in table 3 column 2 and 3 we also estimated a version of the eaa logit model which accounted for the fact that individual characteristics may affect preferences for opt out option initially a set of socio economic variables were included one by one age of the respondent household size educational attainments income level actual organic consumer in the utility function through interaction terms with the dummy code for opt out scenario these interactions terms were not significant in the model except for the indicator variable for actual organic consumer based on the aic and the bic we consider that the eealogit specification was this last model table 3 column 4 and 5 reports the predicted attribute probability non attendance based on the last estimation of the eealogit model it can be seen from these results that a substantial share of respondents about 61 of the sample ignored the price attribute the proportion of respondents taking price into account must be borne in mind when quantifying and interpreting the willingness to pay wtp estimates and interpretation all respondents were assumed to have attended to fragrant attribute to make their choice it is not a surprise that only 4 of respondents ignore the label attribute as a large proportion 67 of those surveyed stated that they had experience of organic food the attribute for targeted ecosystem services was also considered more frequently but still ignored by 17 of respondents table 3 column 4 presents the utility function the opt out option is associated to a positive and significant coefficient meaning that the majority of respondents prefer their actual rice however organic consumers are willing to pay for alternative rice qualities as expected the parameter estimate on the variable price is negative and significant indicating that an increase in the price of a rice product entailed a reduced utility level the quality of the rice was positive and statistically significant only at p value set at 10 meaning that the majority of the respondents are quite indifferent between fragrant and normal rice all three variables indicating that the agricultural production method was chemical free were positive and significant indicating that safer products do indeed increase utility rice grown with organic production methods provides the highest utility followed by rice grown without chemical use either the production method was certified chemical free or not environmental attributes also have significant and positive impact on the consumer s utility 5 2 the latent class model the latent class model allows individuals to be grouped into relatively homogeneous classes of preference i e individuals who belong to the same class exhibit identical choice behavior the model estimates the membership probability in each class and the utility functions specific to each class thus we can assume the existence of classes of preferences within our population according to individual perception of the attributes and the possibility of similar attribute non attendance strategies we thus expect one or more classes for which the coefficient of price attribute and attribute variables describing ecosystem services to be equal to zero the first step of the econometric procedure for the latent class approach of choice probability corresponds to the estimation of class membership function in order to determine the optimal number of classes with three attributes we tested 2 to 5 class solutions where the probability model for class selection did not include any socio economic variables as factor of class membership they are not significant and were removed from the model we used the most used criteria to determine the number of classes the minimum bayesian information criterion bic these statistics support three classes as the optimal solution test results for different number of classes are provided in the appendix a3 the choice equation has thus to be constructed according to three classes of preferences the econometric estimation of the choice equation with the same set of explanatory factors as for the eaalogit model provides differentiated parameters for each class the results of estimation are displayed in table 4 class 1 represents 24 of respondents class 2 represents 59 of the sample and class 3 accounts for 17 of the sample we observed that for all three classes of preferences the coefficients associated with the price attribute are negative and significant and we found important contrast between the estimated value for class 2 and coefficient estimates for class 1 and 3 the value of the coefficient is ten times lower indicating individuals whose choices are grouped in class 2 have a totally different preference for this attribute class two merge individuals who may perceive the price attribute much larger we cannot exclude the fact that class 2 will merge respondents who could be considered as non attenders or more precisely low attenders for price with eaalogit model contrary to hensher et al 2012 42 we believe that the situation of limited budget in developing country may lead respondents to perceive price attribute levels too high in such a way that only price levels below a certain amount are taken into consideration we also find out that only in class 3 that coefficient estimates for labelling attribute levels are statistically non significant however these results could not be interpreted as attribute non attendance such behavior was not detected by our eaalogit estimation they may indicate that class 3 merge individuals who are not sensitive to labelling attribute furthermore preservation of flooded forest was not valued at all in this group of respondents suggesting that these respondents were not sensitive to this attribute when faced with rice quality scenarios having this attribute level for ecosystem services the coefficient of the interaction term between opt out option and indicator variable for actual organic consumer is positive and statistically significant meaning that organic consumers perceive higher benefit when choosing to stay with their actual rice compared to proposed alternative rice qualities this is in contrast to the reported result in class 1 choice equation 5 3 marginal wtp estimates our objective for this study was not to identify the participants ideal rice product but to assess their willingness to pay wtp for different attributes that can define traditionally grown rice compared with standard rice grown with chemical fertilizer pesticides first of all we find that 40 of the respondent has a positive wtp in this study since they attend the price attribute this does not mean that the remaining 60 who have neglected the price does not value the attributes considered but as part of this investigation they have not considered the price to make their choice the distribution of wtp shown in table 5 only concerns those who considered the price level to make their choice the results presented in column 2 and 3 correspond to estimated wtp values inferred from the parameters of the eaalogit model while the wtp estimates inferred from the two estimations are not comparable table 5 column 4 to 7 also provides distribution of wtp values inferred from parameters of class 1 and class 3 choice equations of the latent logit model it is worth noting that the wtp estimates for the two classes differ since each model is subject to different individual preferences and attribute attendance behavior based on the eaalogit model which provides a better fit for the overall choice model the mean value of the willingness to pay for organic certified grown rice compared with standard rice grown with chemical fertilizer and use of pesticide is 3587riels kg with a standard deviation of 1343riels kg this value seems reasonable currently the price differential between normal white rice phakchney and organic certified grown rice is about 1000riels kg labels play the role of signal for the consumer and help them assess product quality that can positively affect their utility 43 as such certification procedures are important because they affect confidence of consumer on the label that have to differentiate production methods in this study it appears that individuals do not make difference between organic label and free chemical label which is valued about 3261riels kg finally they less value a rice product without chemistry but not necessarily one which is certified with a price premium of 1988riels per kilo the results also show that the preservation of the quality of rivers and their biodiversity wins the support of consumers over 83 of respondents gave importance to ecosystem service attributes the mean values of the wtp to maintain the se by rice cultivation of those who take into consideration price are 2138riels kg for water and biodiversity the 2488riels kg for the preservation of flooded forests for protection against flooding and 1950 riels kg for the conservation of local variety 6 discussion and conclusion the choice experiment we used provided respondents with an environment that is more comparable to a real shopping experience where a consumer can decide between different options or not to buy their normal product our results suggest that consumers are willing to pay more for rice produced using chemical free methods in addition our respondents value the certified organic certified grown rice over certified rice grown using chemical free methods furthermore the price premium currently charged for organic rice is higher than the price premium as observed in the local market organic rice sells for a premium price mainly because the production processing procurement and distribution costs are higher than for rice produced using conventional methods the niche market situation supply lower than demand of organic food products may also lead to higher prices higher wtp value than the price premium in the market indicates that the consumer is willing to pay an additional premium price since they perceive it as healthier and of better quality 44 another major aspect of this study is that consumers express additional values for the preservation of biodiversity and river water quality ecosystem services related to rice cultivation systems environmental protection activities that also benefit other citizens get the same support from consumers as their healthiness counterpart conveyed by the presence of an organic label this is in contrast to other major studies findings which conclude that the purchase of organic products is mainly motivated by self interested concerns relating to health quality and taste rather than ecological concerns relating to the environment durham et al 45 is one exception to this however their results concern people living in developed countries this last result is particularly important when considering that those who reported eating organic products in cambodia are motivated more by preserving their health than by protecting the natural environment this shows that there is a demand for water quality in rivers to be protected along with aquatic species in addition residents of large cities are willing to pay higher price premiums to support production methods that promote these specific public goods as ecosystem services the wtp values obtained by this exploratory study thus represent new figures for an organic rice product targeting the local market the organic certification has been promoted by national governments ngos or international institutions these different actors see in this tool a means to reduce rural poverty by using the price premium promised by the niche market of organic food 46 however the development of certified organic farming which targets the local market faces both organizational and ecological constraints organic practices are often the best solution for poor farmers because no additional funding is required to buy additional inputs however low yield associated with this organic technique compared to conventional ones 47 dissuade farmers from adopting such practices this economic argument is reinforced by ecological constraints for the case of rice cultivation in the tsl on which the agrarian analysis of this study is based natural flooding is the main ingredient for organic rice production however chemical contamination of a rice field in the event of flash floods can result in the immediate loss of the organic label faced with this risk farmers opt to sell their rice on the local market without using the marketing network of certified products the results of this study open new perspectives on two fronts firstly rice cultivation systems that preserve the quality of rivers and habitats for agro biodiversity need to benefit from a price premium a proportion of urban consumers are willing to contribute to the preservation of this ecosystem service whether they are already organic consumers or not organic certification is still very selective the challenge for market based environmental policy instruments in this specific case of rice cultivation is thus to find innovative certification strategy that generates win win win solutions 48 optimize anticipated price premiums for farmers foster consumer confidence in the health and nutritional benefits of rice products and preserve ecosystem functions and services the attribute attendance issue is one of the hottest theoretical and empirical topics being currently opened by economic valuation in the case of payment for ecosystem services in the developing world the results of the exploratory analysis in this study confirm that choice experiment application to this subject area should take into consideration non attendance behavior however questions related to protocol surveys and the best econometric methods to capture such behavior are still relatively unanswered 49 appendixes table a 1

8713,abiotic stresses such as droughts and floods significantly constrain rice production in india new stress tolerant technologies have the potential to reduce yield variability and help insulate farmers from the risks posed by these hazards using discrete choice experiments conducted in rural odisha we estimate farmers valuation for drought tolerant dt and submergence tolerant subt traits embodied in rice cultivars our results demonstrate that farmers in both drought prone as well as submergence prone regions value reduction in yield variability offered by new stress tolerant cultivars and would generally be willing to pay a significant premium for these traits while virtually all farmers perceive the threat of drought and are willing to pay for protection against drought risk only farmers in flood prone areas would be willing to pay for rice that can withstand being submerged for prolonged periods suggesting the potential for market segmentation along geographical or ecological lines keywords drought tolerance submergence tolerance rice seeds choice experiment india 1 introduction water stress is an important factor constraining agricultural sector in developing countries as a significant share of farmland is dependent on rainfall for its water needs about 50 of the total rice farmland in south asia is rainfed in nature 1 variability in rainfall makes these areas susceptible to droughts and floods the frequent occurrences of submergence and drought are the major causes of crop failure income volatility and the persistent poverty among the small and marginal rice farmers in south asia 2 demonstrates that both drought and submergence significantly affect rice production in bangladesh rice is a major food crop in india whose production is significantly constrained by droughts and submergence about 68 of the total cropping area in india is rainfed 3 of the roughly 40 million hectares of harvested rice area in india only about 60 is irrigated 4 leaving the rest precariously dependent upon rainfall and hence susceptible to drought droughts have obvious consequences in terms of yield reductions especially if droughts occur during key stages in the rice growth cycle in which plant development is particularly sensitive to water requirements but droughts may also limit the area under cultivation such as in the case of delayed monsoon onset both of these consequences have potentially severe implications for overall rice production and farm incomes the value of rice production lost in drought years has been estimated to be as high as 36 of the total value of rice production in eastern india and the economic costs of droughts to rainfed rice farmers in eastern india are of the order of several hundred million dollars per year 5 in addition about 49 8 million hectares of land area about 15 2 of total geographic area are prone to floods in india causing a range of losses to human life property forests and crops 6 rice seeds that are tolerant to droughts and submergence have a potential to protect farmers from crop losses the present study aims to evaluate farmers valuation for drought and submergence tolerance characteristics in rice seeds using discrete choice experiment methodology in rural odisha odisha located in the eastern part of india is one of the poorest states of india droughts and floods occur frequently in odisha 7 the state has been severely affected by five major floods in the last 15 years including one following the devastating cyclone paradip in 1999 8 rice is cultivated on an area of 4 45 million hectares between 2001 and 2008 around 0 9 million hectares of rice cropped area was exposed to damage by flood and submergence and around 0 8 0 10 million hectares of cultivated rainfed rice was prone to drought stress in 2011 9 rainfed rice production in odisha is dependent upon the seasonal monsoon and droughts and floods often arise as a direct consequence of variations in monsoon season rainfall but the current understanding of climate change in monsoon dependent regions such as india is plagued with uncertainty given the complexities of atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns the ipcc s special report on managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation srex finds evidence of a general consensus among climate models for an increasing trend in the length of dry spells in much of southern and eastern india including odisha during the 21st century 10 the current state of scientific knowledge therefore suggests a possible future for odisha in which rice production is increasingly prone to drought and flood stress given that average yields in odisha are well below the national average these changes may have significant implications for farm livelihoods substantial scientific effort has gone into breeding water stress tolerant traits into staple crops like rice in recent years drought tolerance dt globally has received a huge amount of attention from governments and foreign donors expenditure on dt research has increased exponentially since 2000 11 under the stress tolerant rice for africa and south asia strasa project rice breeders from the international rice research institute irri and partner organizations have successfully developed improved stress tolerant rice varieties suitable for cultivation throughout south asia of particular note are varieties released for cultivation in eastern india that are tolerant to drought sahbhagi dhan and submergence swarna sub1 several recent studies have documented potential benefits from the adoption of stress tolerant rice seeds 12 estimated that successful development and delivery of dt varieties would produce significant benefits across south asia well in excess of the investment necessary to develop the technology through a randomized field experiment in odisha 13 studied the effects of the submergence tolerant subt rice variety swarna sub1 on rice yields finding that swarna sub1 had a significant and positive effect on rice yields relative to non tolerant varieties when fields were submerged for as long as 7 14 days the development and delivery of stress tolerant traits has been seen as a potential avenue through which human livelihoods can be at least partially insulated from the negative impacts of these stresses but the successful development of these technologies does not imply that the benefits will necessarily be realized realization of these benefits is contingent upon farmers actually cultivating the seeds in which these technologies are embodied unlike some biotic stress tolerant seeds such as insect resistant crops containing the soil bacterium b thuringiensis or bt in their dna the relative benefits of water stress tolerant cultivars are largely non monotonic while the benefits of stress tolerant cultivars are increasing for a certain range of stress severity they are decreasing for another range of stress severity and likely zero once the stress level becomes too severe 14 additionally under normal conditions the stress tolerant cultivar may underperform popular non tolerant varieties the non monotonic nature of these relative benefits makes it difficult for farmers to learn about the benefits of the technology which may hinder its widespread adoption even where we might objectively expect positive impacts from adoption for the successful diffusion of new agricultural technologies like dt and subt seeds it is important for researchers breeders policymakers and development practitioners to have a deeper understanding of farmers preferences for crop attributes this study aims to fill this gap by studying farmers preferences for dt and subt traits to date there has been relatively little effort to study the potential pathway by which these breeding developments may be translated into actual adoption 15 is the only other study making such an attempt among indian rice farmers for dt traits finding that farmers in drought prone areas of bihar india largely preferred dt cultivars to status quo their study also analyzed the role of behavioral parameters such as risk and loss aversion in contrast to their study the present study includes analysis of farmers preferences for both subt traits as well as dt traits in the context of odisha it is important to consider preferences for both types of stress tolerance since as noted above farmers in odisha are frequently exposed to both drought and flood risks we design a discrete choice experiment and complement the experiment with a separate survey to collect data on socioeconomic characteristics it is worth mentioning that although a few rice seed varieties tolerant to drought and submergence have been released in india the seeds are not widely available further many more are under various stages of development seed multiplication takes time and commercial availability on a large scale may take many years since there does not exist any market data for such seeds we employ a stated preference approach namely choice experiment widely used for economic valuation of non market goods to elicit farmers wtp for various attributes in rice seeds the next section presents empirical methodology section 3 describes data sources and section 4 presents results section 5 discusses the results and finally section 6 concludes 2 empirical methodology the study relies upon the use of discrete choice experiments to estimate farmers valuation for different seed traits in a choice experiment individuals are presented a series of hypothetical choice scenarios in which they must choose between bundles of different traits each taking one of a number of pre specified levels through statistical analysis of participants choices given the alternatives available in each choice scenario the researcher is able to estimate marginal values in either utility or monetary terms for the various attributes embodied in the alternatives researchers control the experimental choice environment by providing necessary variation in attribute levels which may not be present in the historical data the methodology is particularly useful for getting valuation of products that are yet not on the market for instance new technologies that are at a development stage there exists a very large literature employing choice experiments in the field of agricultural and resource economics some of the studies are provided below the methodology has been employed to analyze consumer preferences for environmental amenities 16 19 ecosystem services 20 22 food quality attributes 23 and new and improved production technologies 15 the use of choice experiments in india is relatively rare to date most stated choice studies in india have used the traditional contingent valuation approach for the valuation of new agricultural technologies 24 25 an important condition for the success of choice experiments is that respondents be able to relate to the options that are presented in this regard the choice scenarios with which participants are presented should closely resemble real world seed purchasing decisions they face on a regular basis in an attempt to satisfy this condition the seed attributes and their respective levels specified in our experiment were carefully chosen so that farmers could relate to them prior to designing the choice experiment we conducted a number of focus group discussions fgds with farmers in cuttack district of odisha to identify the attributes that are important to the farmers we also consulted the existing literature and met with rice scientists at crri central rice research institute cuttack odisha to decide attribute levels we also tried to ensure that respondents could understand and meaningfully relate to the options the choice sets and accompanying survey were translated into the local language oriya and the enumerators used the local language in interviewing participants visual illustrations were also used for better comprehension of the alternatives 2 1 attributes and levels through the course of the fgds farmers identified yield to be the most important trait for selecting a rice variety yields however are the result of stochastic processes so characterizing yields especially in light of these water stresses requires some finesse dalton et al 2011 used a novel approach to quantify the dt attribute in their study of kenyan farmers preferences for dt maize they described the attribute in terms of not only mean expected yield but also the variance of yield distribution under different moisture stress conditions the approach incorporates non monotonic nature of the relative benefits of dt variety 15 modified this approach in studying demand for dt rice among farmers in bihar india we have followed the basic approach of 15 to quantify dt in our study the dt attribute takes three levels related to different degrees of stochastic dominance over a popular local variety 2 2 swarna a popular rice variety in odisha that gives a yield of 53 quintals per hectare qtl ha under normal conditions 22 qtl ha under moderate drought stress and 6qtl ha under severe drought stress 26 has been considered as the reference variety in the first of these three levels the dt first order stochastically dominates the reference variety it yields higher under normal conditions under moderate drought stress conditions and under severe drought stress conditions in the second level the dt second order stochastically dominates the reference variety while it does not yield more nor less than the reference under normal conditions it has higher yields under both moderate and severe drought stress conditions in the third and final level the dt third order stochastically dominates the reference variety the dt yields no more nor less than the reference variety under normal and moderate drought stress conditions but it yields more under severe drought stress the yield distribution of sahbhagi dhan a recently released dt cultivar has informed our specification of yield distributions for different levels of stochastic dominance presented in our choice experiment 26 in order to explain the dt yield attribute to the respondents visual illustrations were used in the choice experiment each alternative depicted three levels of water stress and associated yield with them under the dt attribute the water stress was depicted by using pictures of water level in a water tank a tank that is full up to the rim indicates normal rainfall or no water stress a half filled tank indicates mild water stress and a tank with very little water indicates severe water stress the interviewer explained this to the respondents associated with each of the water stress levels there was a picture depicting the yield ranging from a green cover to a barren land along with a numerical value given in quintals hectare thus the dt attribute was communicated to the respondents in terms of the yield they could obtain under various water stress conditions 3 3 table 5 shows that less than 10 of the respondents ignored yield attribute suggesting that the respondents were able to comprehend the attribute we include subt as an attribute with three varying levels namely tolerance of 0 5 days 5 10 days and 10 15 days of full submergence our reference variety swarna can tolerate submergence for 0 5 days and a recently released subt rice variety swarna sub1 can tolerate submergence up to 15 days 4 4 in a series of field trials 44 found swarna sub1 to withstand submergence for up to 17 days given likely differences in conditions between agronomic field trial plots and farmer fields we have assumed a slightly reduced degree of tolerance during fgds farmers also indicated short duration to be an important attribute this represents another avenue through which breeding research can increase farmers resilience to droughts we have included three levels of crop duration short less than 120 days medium 120 135 days and long more than 135 days we have also included an attribute that distinguishes between seeds that can be stored and reused in the next season and those that cannot 5 5 most of the benefits that arise as a result of the hybridization process such as increased productivity and uniformity are fully expressed in first generation seeds but decline dramatically in subsequent generations therefore farmers must purchase new hybrid seeds every year in order to continually realize these benefits the seeds that can be stored and reused in the next season have a different impact on intertemporal income and random utility than the seeds that have to be purchased every year since purchasing seeds that cannot be stored entails incurring seed cost this year as well as farmers ability to have ready access to seeds in the future periods as a result of which seed costs have to be incurred every year in future 6 6 we thank the anonymous referee for pointing this out to us following the literature e g ward et al however in our choice experiment we have assumed seed reusability as an attribute whose value gets reflected in the wtp of seeds embodying such attribute thus in a way our choice experiment captures trade off between yield enhancing and yield variability reducing attributes in seeds in the current year and seed reusability in future years finally since we are ultimately interested in estimating money metric measures for willingness to pay wtp we incorporate an additional parameter capturing different prices to capture the price of inbreds as well as hybrids and to provide enough variation in seed price levels we have included six price levels ranging from rs 15 per kg to rs 300 per kg in the choice sets 7 7 the market price of hybrid rice is varying between rs 200 and rs 250 per kg in india 45 the attributes and various levels are summarized in table 1 there is a vast literature exploring the many issues pertinent to choice experiment design and many criteria by which such designs can be evaluated e g 27 28 using experimental design methods the rice seed attributes and their levels were combined into choice sets we used a blocked fractional factorial design which reduces the number of choice sets given to decision makers and efficiently estimates the utility parameters we constructed a d optimal experimental design based on a main effects only linear utility specification with null priors 16 29 30 this design generated 36 unique choice sets which were subsequently randomly allocated into four blocks of 9 choice sets each 8 8 d optimal designs minimize the d error of the design which is computed as the weighted determinant of the variance covariance matrix of the design where the weight is an exponential weight equal to the reciprocal of the number of parameters to be estimated the d efficiency and d error reported for our design are 5 1181 and 0 1954 respectively farmers in the sample were randomly allocated to each of these four blocks with a balanced number of farmers assigned to each of the four blocks each choice set contained three alternative hypothetical rice seeds plus a status quo option the status quo option is the rice seed the farmer used in the past rice season the information on the rice seed used in the past season and the data on its attributes was collected by the researchers through a primary survey the status quo for each farmer was then coded in terms of attribute s levels for the econometric analysis an example of a choice card presented to survey participants is shown in fig 1 our utility model flows from non separable agricultural household model where production decisions are guided by consumption and sale 31 9 9 in our sample approximately 34 of the total rice harvested during kharif and rabi season 2012 is sold for commercial purposes 36 is used for self consumption and the remaining 30 is kept as seed or used for other purposes such as gift wages etc the decision making framework relies on a trait based model of cultivar choice 32 note that when technology traits exhibit non pecuniary effects or give rise to nonseparability it becomes appropriate to use farmers technology adoption decisions within the framework of utility maximizing behavior wherein utility is maximized by choosing a combination of technology traits among a set of feasible alternatives 2 2 model econometric analysis of choice experiment data rests on the framework of random utility theory which describes discrete choices in a utility maximizing framework 33 10 10 utility maximization is one of a number of possible paradigms by which we can classify farmer behavior other paradigms include regret minimization lexicographic preferences and so on in what follows we will follow the assumption of 46 and 33 and assume that the process of utility maximization necessarily incorporates errors due to imperfect perception and optimization as well as the inability of the econometrician to exactly measure all of the relevant variables 47 the utility function will therefore be a random function with both a deterministic component and a stochastic component suppose that individual i faces j alternatives contained in choice set s during choice occasion t we can define an underlying latent variable v i j t that denotes the indirect utility associated with individual i s choosing option j s in choice occasion t for a fixed budget constraint random utility maximization implies that individual i will choose alternative j so long as v i j t v i q t q j the researcher does not directly observe v i j t but instead observes the choice made by the respondent denoted as v i j t where v i j t 1 if v i j t max v i 1 t v i 2 t v i j t and 0 otherwise following the standard assumption that utility for an alternative is a linear function of its characteristics 11 11 this implies that marginal utility is strictly monotonic in traits and gives rise to a corner solution in which only one product is purchased 32 we can write individual i s indirect utility function as 1 v i j t x i j t β ε i j t where x i j t is a vector of attributes for the j th alternative β is a vector of taste parameters that is a vector of weights mapping attribute levels into utility and ε i j t is a stochastic component of utility that is independent and identically distributed across individuals and alternative choices and takes a known distribution this stochastic component of utility captures unobserved variations in tastes as well as errors in the consumer s perceptions and optimization we assume that the random component of utility ε i j t follows a gumbel distribution then under the assumption that these terms are identically and independently distributed we can write our expression for the probability of observing alternative j chosen over all other alternatives conditional upon the observed levels of the attribute vector for all alternatives in the choice set s which gives us the basic conditional logit model and can be estimated using maximum likelihood the conditional logit framework assumes homogeneous preferences across respondents and independence of irrelevant alternatives 34 a common method of evaluating preference heterogeneity is estimation of random parameters logit rpl models the rpl is regarded as a highly flexible model that can approximate any random utility model and relaxes the limitations of the traditional conditional logit by allowing random taste variation within a sample according to a specified distribution and relaxes the assumption of independence from irrelevant alternatives 35 following 36 the probability that individual i chooses alternative j from the choice set s in situation t is given by 2 p r o b v i j t 1 x i 1 t x i 2 t x i j t ω e x p x i j t β i q 1 q e x p x i q t β i f β ω d β where β i is a vector of unknown taste parameters specific to individual i and the matrix ω defines the parameters characterizing the distribution of the random parameters the researcher is able to specify the families of these distributions and where necessary or advantageous impose restrictions on the distributions for our purposes we allow the coefficients corresponding to all attributes except price to vary normally while the price coefficient is fixed 12 12 since the wtp for an attribute is given by the ratio of the attribute coefficient to the price coefficient the wtp from a mixed logit model is given by the ratio of two randomly distributed terms depending on the choice of distributions for the coefficients this can lead to wtp distributions which are heavily skewed and that may not even have defined moments a common approach to dealing with this potential problem is to specify the price coefficient to be fixed this is a convenient assumption as in this case the distribution of the willingness to pay for an attribute is simply the distribution of the attribute coefficient scaled by the fixed price coefficient 48 given the utilitarian interpretation of our econometric specification the vector of parameters β i β i 1 β i 2 β i k defining tastes and preferences over the k attributes can be interpreted as marginal utilities and the ratio of two such marginal utilities is simply the marginal rate of substitution of one for the other if one of the included attributes say the k th attribute is the price of the alternative then β i k β k can be interpreted as the marginal utility of price or cost the negative of which is the marginal utility of income or money the marginal rate of substitution of money for each of the corresponding attributes that is wtp can be computed as 3 w t p i k β i k β k k 1 k 1 the marginal utility disutility for favorable unfavorable attributes will be positive negative indicating that the farmer is willing unwilling to substitute an increase in an attribute s expression for money 3 data sources the experiments and accompanying survey were conducted with farmers in three different districts of odisha in june july 2013 odisha is one of the largest rice producing and consuming states in india the state lies in eastern india and shares its coastline with the bay of bengal the topography of odisha is such that it contains both low lying coastal areas which frequently get flooded for prolonged periods and rainfed uplands that suffer from moisture stress due to variability in rainfall the districts included in the study were carefully chosen to include areas that suffer from droughts as well as those prone to prolonged floods we used a multi stage sampling approach to select our survey sample in the first stage we identified three adjacent districts in odisha that are susceptible to drought and or floods specifically we identified the districts dhenkanal cuttack and jagatsinghpur fig 2 the district of dhenkanal has been repeatedly affected by droughts including in recent years 2002 2005 2006 2008 and 2010 during 2008 it was estimated that more than 70 of total rice area in dhenkanal was adversely affected due to drought 37 dhenkanal is also one of the eight districts in odisha identified by the government of india for treatment under the drought prone area programme jagatsinghpur district situated along the bay of bengal on the eastern coast of odisha is prone to various natural hazards such as floods and cyclones the district has been severely affected by five major floods in the last 15 years the third district cuttack demonstrates a great deal of heterogeneity in terms of agro climatic conditions with some areas susceptible to droughts and others susceptible to floods in the second stage we stratified blocks sub district administrative units within cuttack and dhenkanal that were being affected by droughts the drought affected blocks drawn for the study are directly proportional to the population of each block as a proportion of total population of all the drought affected blocks within cuttack and dhenkanal similarly we stratified blocks among flood affected regions of cuttack and jagatsinghpur in this way we identified four blocks affected by droughts and four blocks affected by floods hereafter we will refer to these regions as drought prone and flood prone respectively we then selected two villages from each of these eight blocks using probability proportional to size sampling finally we randomly selected 25 rice growing households in each village from household lists provided by village leaders the resulting sample consisted of 400 rice growing households descriptive statistics of the sampled farmers are reported in table 2 while the second column presents the characteristics of the households in the pooled sample the third and fourth columns present and compare the characteristics of farmers in the drought prone and flood prone regions separately in our sample as compared with the households in the drought prone region the households in flood prone areas have higher mean annual income are more educated on average and have a higher proportion belonging to the general caste to get a sense of representativeness of our sample we also report summary statistics of available variables at the level of rural odisha and rural india in columns 5 and 6 the households in our sample as compared to households in rural odisha are more educated on average have a higher proportion of muslims a higher proportion of general caste and a larger proportion employed in agriculture and allied activities table 3 provides information on the distribution of the attributes of rice seeds used in the past rice season there were no farmers that were cultivating the drought tolerant variety many were cultivating the reference variety but there were also many farmers cultivating idiosyncratic landraces in any event the yields in alternatives still stochastically dominated farmers varieties 4 estimation and interpretation of results 4 1 econometric results if all respondents paid due attention to each and every attribute when evaluating the choice tasks then estimation of the taste parameters could proceed by simply estimating equation 2 by rpl these estimation results are reported in table 4 it however has been argued in the literature that some respondents may simplify the choice sets by ignoring one or more attributes characterizing the alternatives attribute nonattendance which if not controlled for results in significantly overestimated measures of wtp 38 attempted to infer attribute nonattendance from choice experiment data by making use of post estimation conditioning approaches if an attribute is serially ignored i e the respondent ignores the attribute in question across all choice tasks then its contribution to individual utility is zero both within and across choice scenarios which should be reflected by imposing restrictions on the parameter space for that particular individual we follow their approach for identifying nonattendance taking advantage of individual taste coefficients and variation estimated by conditioning the posterior mean marginal utility estimates on observed choices and choice experiment data the rpl model allows random taste heterogeneity by allowing marginal utility coefficients to be distributed randomly across respondents in the sample population the estimated parameters describe the distribution of β in the entire sample but do not provide any information on the likely location of a given individual on this distribution one could obtain more information on individual coefficients by conditioning on the observed choices for specific individuals this involves making a distinction between the distribution of β in the population unconditional distribution and the distribution of β in the subpopulation of people who faced the same alternatives and made the same choices yielding the conditional distribution g β j d a t a i ω this conditional distribution provides a straightforward method for estimating the expected marginal utility for each subpopulation that responds in a similar fashion when presented the same choice scenario e β i j d a t a i β j g β j d a t a i ω d β for notational simplicity in what follows we will use the notation β i j to indicate the posterior expectation of marginal utility for individual i and attribute j to identify attributes ignored by farmers we compute the coefficient of variation cv of the conditional distribution for each attribute level for all the 400 households 38 a high cv implies that the variation in stated preferences is excessive relative to the mean which makes the distribution noisy which may imply that the individual is in fact not attending to that particular attribute in his or her decision making process while the specification of this threshold is admittedly arbitrary we follow 38 and use a threshold cv of 2 to determine nonattendance table 5 summarizes the number of households with a cv greater than or equal to 2 for each attribute the attributes most often ignored in the pooled sample are medium duration and subt for 5 10 days followed by subt for 10 15 days for the drought prone region the highest number of households ignored the medium duration and subt for 10 15 days attributes again we can relate these results to statistically insignificant marginal valuations for these two attributes in the rpl estimates for the drought prone region finally somewhat ironically the attributes ignored by a large number of households in the flood prone region are subt for 5 10 days grains that cannot be stored and reused medium duration and subt for 10 15 days given that a considerable number of households ignored certain attributes we re estimate the rpl model by specifying the coefficient of marginal utility to be zero for ignored attributes in households utility functions the results of this constrained rpl model are presented in table 6 while the sample average wtp for the various attributes is reported in table 6 rpl results across the two regions are reported in the two right hand columns of table 6 separate estimation was done for each of the regions using 1800 observations for the sample of 200 farmers in each segment qualitatively the results are similar to those of the pooled sample marginal utility of attributes associated with dt technology is positive and significant in both the subsamples while the marginal utility for subt 5 10 days continues to be positive and highly significant in the drought prone region it becomes positive and highly significant for the flood prone region the marginal utility associated with subt 10 15 days continues to be insignificant for the drought prone area but becomes positive and significant for the flood prone region there is considerably high marginal utility for the short duration attribute in both regions although marginal utilities cannot be directly compared across the two groups due to potential differences in scale effect wtp can be since scale effects are eliminated it is worth noting that the valuations are consistently higher for all the attributes in the flood prone region as compared with the drought prone region with the ironic sole exception of subt for 5 10 days the difference in valuations is remarkably large for the short duration attribute and for having to purchase new seed every year as we will later show this result will have a bearing on the wtp estimates in the two regions 4 2 willingness to pay table 7 reports willingness to pay estimates on average farmers have a positive and statistically significant wtp for the productivity increasing as well as risk reducing attributes associated with dt technology in the drought prone sample the wtp for the first order stochastic dominant fsd yield distribution is larger than the wtp for the second order stochastic dominant ssd yield distribution which is in turn higher than the wtp for the third order stochastic dominant tsd yield distribution 13 13 it should be noted however that the sample average wtp estimates are not statistically distinct from one another in the flood prone sample however the wtp for the third order stochastically dominant tsd yield distribution is actually higher than the wtp for the other two distributions farmers in the flood prone areas therefore are willing to pay a higher premium for seeds that reduce their exposure to severe droughts while not necessarily demanding an increase in expected yields yields under normal conditions or less variability farmers in the flood prone sample have on average a positive wtp for long term submergence tolerance though the average wtp is only statistically significant at the 10 level in drought prone areas the coefficient for 5 10 days submergence tolerance is positive and significant however the coefficient of submergence tolerance 10 15 days is negative but insignificant the latter may appear as an unexpected finding as one would expect a positive and a larger coefficient for the 10 15 days submergence tolerance one possible explanation could be because that those residing in drought prone areas may not perceive susceptibility to floods of such a prolonged duration as to not justify a large valuation in other words they may not derive any utility from a trait from which they do not expect to ever reap a benefit not surprisingly we find positive significant and considerably high marginal utility for the short duration attribute there are various possible reasons for this first short duration provides a means of escaping the abiotic stress drought or flood if droughts arise due to rainfall deficiencies at the two ends of the growing season that is due to late monsoon onset or early monsoon cessation short duration allows farmers to either delay transplanting in the case of delayed monsoon onset or harvest a fully mature crop without creeping into rabi season land preparation second short duration may allow farmers to grow another short duration crop between the kharif and rabi crops these crops are typically higher value horticultural crops which provide increased farm incomes as well as income diversification third short duration rice may provide farmers with a window of time in which to pursue nonagricultural income short duration varieties can also help in alleviating the hunger period the pre harvesting period when typically food availability is low and prices are high if some crops mature earlier they can provide food in this period our results suggest that if seeds that produce grains that cannot be stored and reused as seed in the next season have no yield advantage then farmers would demand a high discount to cultivate them however the hybrids available in markets are often more expensive than the open pollinated varieties this may be because hybrids usually have high yield potential embodied in them and thus the price of hybrids that we see in actual markets reflects valuation for yield improvement and other benefits conferred in them discounted by the lack of seed reusability trait 14 14 while hybrids largely confer higher and more uniform yields at lower seeding rates than varieties i e a lower quantity of seed is required to cultivate a given area hybrid seeds must be purchased anew every year for the benefits to be observed 15 under each partition the parameters are estimated separately so it is possible to reach different determinations about ana based on the particular sub sample estimates and therefore the numbers from the two sub samples may not add to the number from the pooled sample 4 3 demand curves we can use the estimated coefficients from the rpl model to calculate aggregate demand for new seeds with specified attributes using the sample enumeration technique the probability of choosing different alternatives is predicted for each individual by using the estimated coefficients in conjunction with equation 2 the predicted share of the sample choosing different alternatives is then obtained by summing over these probabilities the demand for alternative j denoted by d j is given by 4 d j i 1 n p r o b v i j t 1 x j β ˆ where β ˆ denotes coefficients estimated from the rpl model and n denotes the number of individuals in the sample to get a share the demand is divided by the number of individuals in the sample different demand functions are generated by varying the vector of observable attributes x j keeping the parameter estimates β ˆ unchanged suppose for example we are considering introduction of two alternative new seeds called a 1 and a 2 seed a 1 has properties similar to sahbhagi dhan it is a short duration inbred variety with yields along the lines of the fsd distribution introduced earlier seed a 2 has properties similar to swarna sub1 it is a medium duration inbred rice variety that can tolerate being submerged for up to 15 days fig 3 illustrates the predicted demand vis à vis status quo if one of these seeds was introduced in the pooled sample as the price of the new seed varies from rs 50 per kg to rs 1000 per kg the continuous curve and the dashed curve depict demand for a 1 and a 2 respectively and each curve depicts the percentage of farmers who would choose the new seed at various prices as expected the demand curves slope downward indicating that as the price increases a smaller proportion of farmers would be likely to purchase the seed clearly the demand for seed type a 1 is higher than that of seed type a 2 fig 4 illustrates the demand curves for a 1 and a 2 in drought prone and flood prone regions respectively the continuous curve represents percentage of farmers that would adopt a 1 vis à vis the status quo in the drought prone region while the dashed curve depicts the percentage of farmers that would adopt a 2 vis à vis the status quo in flood prone regions again the figure illustrates that the demand for the seed having subt attribute is low even in the flood prone region 4 4 socio economic characteristics using various versions of rpl model we tried to explore the reasons for heterogeneous preferences of farmers by interacting rice seed attributes with farmers socio economic characteristics such as income caste etc we find that different groups of farmers have different valuation for these new and improved technologies more specifically while the high income farmers have a higher valuation for yield enhancing fsd submergence tolerance short duration attributes the lower income farmers highly value ssd tsd and seed reusability attributes further the non scheduled groups have a higher valuation for almost all rice seed attributes as compared to scheduled caste groups one of the limitations while running separate rpl regressions interacting with income and caste is that in each regression we have potentially confounded effects i e we cannot isolate the effects of income from that of caste in each regression because scheduled caste households are likely to belong to the lower income group 5 discussion the results suggest that on average farmers in the pooled sample are willing to pay a significant premium for dt technologies the different valuations for the three yield distributions illustrated here suggest that while farmers value reductions in yield variability and protection against downside risk they may not be willing to sacrifice higher expected yields to attain these this result is close to 15 and 39 in their analysis of farmers preferences for different yield distributions in rice seeds in bihar india and maize seeds in kenya respectively farmers also highly value short duration rice as well as being able to store grain and use it as seed in subsequent seasons qualitatively the results are similar for the subsamples of drought prone and flood prone regions however the wtp for most attributes is considerably higher in the flood prone region than in the drought prone region which reflects the socioeconomic differences in households from the two regions households in flood prone areas on average have higher mean incomes are more educated and are more likely to belong to the general caste it should be duly noted that while we made efforts to ensure the respondents treated the choice scenarios as they would real world purchasing decisions these wtp estimates are likely biased upward due to the hypothetical nature of the choice exercise while many observers are generally of the opinion that farmers appreciate improvements in seed technologies and would be willing to pay a premium for these improvements the marginal wtp estimates in the odisha samples seem perhaps unreasonably high since we have no alternative but to assume that the observed choices are reflective of farmers true preferences given the options they are confronted with and that the valuations are at least consistent with preference orderings if not of the exact monetary scale that farmers would actually pay a robust result from our study is that the valuation for the dt technology is significantly higher than the valuation for the subt technology our characterization of dt and subt traits may have a bearing on this while we have characterized dt in terms of yield distributions under different moisture stress conditions subt is described in terms of number of days of submergence that crops can tolerate the cognitive burden associated with the dt attribute is probably greater than the one associated with the subt attribute these differences in characterization might have influenced the choice process another robust result from the study is high valuation for the short duration rice by cultivating a short duration variety farmers can escape droughts and floods however our results suggest that farmers value the short duration variety even beyond its ability to escape abiotic stresses in addition farmers cultivating short duration rice are able to supplement their income by either cultivating a short duration vegetable crop after harvesting their kharif rice or by taking advantage of non agricultural opportunities after the kharif harvest some studies conducted in africa and asia have investigated adoption and farmers valuation for improved seeds that have dt attribute 40 survey farm households in six african countries to measure dt maize adoption rates and their determinants they find considerable inter country variation in farmer adoption of dt maize ranging from 9 in zimbabwe to 61 in malawi the major barriers to adoption include unavailability of improved seed lack of awareness and understanding about its benefits lack of resources and high seed price 39 use a choice experiment to elicit wtp for dt attribute in maize seeds in eastern kenya using a latent class model they find the wtp to be highly heterogeneous and the wtp of the segment having the highest wtp was consistent with observed market price for hybrid seeds 41 investigate low adoption of improved sorghum varieties in ethiopia their results suggest that risk factors coupled with access to markets and social capital drive farmers decision to adopt improved varieties of sorghum in a discrete choice experiment study conducted in bangladesh 42 find that farmers are not willing to adopt a dt rice variety without substantial financial incentives such as subsidies however the marginal utility of dt rice increases if the seed is bundled with insurance 6 conclusion abiotic stresses such as droughts and floods lead to significant income and consumption losses for rice growing farmers in india rice seed varieties that have better tolerance to moisture stress conditions and submergence have the potential to protect farmers livelihoods the objective of this study was to estimate farmers valuations for drought and submergence tolerance characteristics in rice seeds using a discrete choice experiment methodology for 400 rice growing farmers in three districts of odisha we find considerable heterogeneity in the farmers valuations for various attributes in rice seeds and thus we report results from an rpl model in the reported results we have accounted for attribute nonattendance we find that farmers in both drought prone and submergence prone regions are generally willing to pay a significant premium for a reduction in yield variability offered by the new rice varieties however only farmers in flood prone areas are willing to pay for rice that can withstand being submerged for prolonged periods the valuation for the dt technology is significantly higher than the valuation for the subt technology farmers also highly value short duration rice as well as seed reusability the valuation for most traits is considerably higher in the flood prone region the results from our study are useful for researchers developing these new technologies in determining the traits they should focus on they are also useful in guiding public and private sector investment in the development and delivery of such technologies our results suggest the existence of naturally occurring market segments in particular the result that farmers in both drought prone and flood prone areas are willing to pay for seed technologies that provide protection against droughts suggests that all farmers even those not residing in designated drought prone areas perceive susceptibility to droughts this may be a result specific to odisha in which many areas have historically endured prolonged dry spells furthermore much of odisha has precariously little irrigation infrastructure with which to buffer production during these dry spells a different story emerges altogether when we consider potential markets for subt varieties such as swarna sub1 farmers in drought prone areas are very clearly not willing to pay for protection from prolonged floods and so would not be a viable market place for such products there does appear to be potential demand for subt products in flood prone areas but the marginal wtp for protection against prolonged submergence is small in comparison with the marginal wtp for other traits such as shorter duration this perhaps suggests that while farmers in flood prone areas might be aware that floods are a threat to their production floods of such a prolonged duration are sufficiently rare as to not justify a large valuation while there is a positive valuation this is perhaps a cautionary note about the potential success of marketing a product like swarna sub1 our estimation results also depict considerable heterogeneity in the preferences of farmers for attributes like short duration medium duration seed reusability and yield variability future research can explore the role of socioeconomic and behavioral factors causing this heterogeneity and of policy interventions that ensure that new technologies are accessible to all sections of society funding source this work was funded by the united states agency for international development usaid and the bill and melinda gates

8713,abiotic stresses such as droughts and floods significantly constrain rice production in india new stress tolerant technologies have the potential to reduce yield variability and help insulate farmers from the risks posed by these hazards using discrete choice experiments conducted in rural odisha we estimate farmers valuation for drought tolerant dt and submergence tolerant subt traits embodied in rice cultivars our results demonstrate that farmers in both drought prone as well as submergence prone regions value reduction in yield variability offered by new stress tolerant cultivars and would generally be willing to pay a significant premium for these traits while virtually all farmers perceive the threat of drought and are willing to pay for protection against drought risk only farmers in flood prone areas would be willing to pay for rice that can withstand being submerged for prolonged periods suggesting the potential for market segmentation along geographical or ecological lines keywords drought tolerance submergence tolerance rice seeds choice experiment india 1 introduction water stress is an important factor constraining agricultural sector in developing countries as a significant share of farmland is dependent on rainfall for its water needs about 50 of the total rice farmland in south asia is rainfed in nature 1 variability in rainfall makes these areas susceptible to droughts and floods the frequent occurrences of submergence and drought are the major causes of crop failure income volatility and the persistent poverty among the small and marginal rice farmers in south asia 2 demonstrates that both drought and submergence significantly affect rice production in bangladesh rice is a major food crop in india whose production is significantly constrained by droughts and submergence about 68 of the total cropping area in india is rainfed 3 of the roughly 40 million hectares of harvested rice area in india only about 60 is irrigated 4 leaving the rest precariously dependent upon rainfall and hence susceptible to drought droughts have obvious consequences in terms of yield reductions especially if droughts occur during key stages in the rice growth cycle in which plant development is particularly sensitive to water requirements but droughts may also limit the area under cultivation such as in the case of delayed monsoon onset both of these consequences have potentially severe implications for overall rice production and farm incomes the value of rice production lost in drought years has been estimated to be as high as 36 of the total value of rice production in eastern india and the economic costs of droughts to rainfed rice farmers in eastern india are of the order of several hundred million dollars per year 5 in addition about 49 8 million hectares of land area about 15 2 of total geographic area are prone to floods in india causing a range of losses to human life property forests and crops 6 rice seeds that are tolerant to droughts and submergence have a potential to protect farmers from crop losses the present study aims to evaluate farmers valuation for drought and submergence tolerance characteristics in rice seeds using discrete choice experiment methodology in rural odisha odisha located in the eastern part of india is one of the poorest states of india droughts and floods occur frequently in odisha 7 the state has been severely affected by five major floods in the last 15 years including one following the devastating cyclone paradip in 1999 8 rice is cultivated on an area of 4 45 million hectares between 2001 and 2008 around 0 9 million hectares of rice cropped area was exposed to damage by flood and submergence and around 0 8 0 10 million hectares of cultivated rainfed rice was prone to drought stress in 2011 9 rainfed rice production in odisha is dependent upon the seasonal monsoon and droughts and floods often arise as a direct consequence of variations in monsoon season rainfall but the current understanding of climate change in monsoon dependent regions such as india is plagued with uncertainty given the complexities of atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns the ipcc s special report on managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation srex finds evidence of a general consensus among climate models for an increasing trend in the length of dry spells in much of southern and eastern india including odisha during the 21st century 10 the current state of scientific knowledge therefore suggests a possible future for odisha in which rice production is increasingly prone to drought and flood stress given that average yields in odisha are well below the national average these changes may have significant implications for farm livelihoods substantial scientific effort has gone into breeding water stress tolerant traits into staple crops like rice in recent years drought tolerance dt globally has received a huge amount of attention from governments and foreign donors expenditure on dt research has increased exponentially since 2000 11 under the stress tolerant rice for africa and south asia strasa project rice breeders from the international rice research institute irri and partner organizations have successfully developed improved stress tolerant rice varieties suitable for cultivation throughout south asia of particular note are varieties released for cultivation in eastern india that are tolerant to drought sahbhagi dhan and submergence swarna sub1 several recent studies have documented potential benefits from the adoption of stress tolerant rice seeds 12 estimated that successful development and delivery of dt varieties would produce significant benefits across south asia well in excess of the investment necessary to develop the technology through a randomized field experiment in odisha 13 studied the effects of the submergence tolerant subt rice variety swarna sub1 on rice yields finding that swarna sub1 had a significant and positive effect on rice yields relative to non tolerant varieties when fields were submerged for as long as 7 14 days the development and delivery of stress tolerant traits has been seen as a potential avenue through which human livelihoods can be at least partially insulated from the negative impacts of these stresses but the successful development of these technologies does not imply that the benefits will necessarily be realized realization of these benefits is contingent upon farmers actually cultivating the seeds in which these technologies are embodied unlike some biotic stress tolerant seeds such as insect resistant crops containing the soil bacterium b thuringiensis or bt in their dna the relative benefits of water stress tolerant cultivars are largely non monotonic while the benefits of stress tolerant cultivars are increasing for a certain range of stress severity they are decreasing for another range of stress severity and likely zero once the stress level becomes too severe 14 additionally under normal conditions the stress tolerant cultivar may underperform popular non tolerant varieties the non monotonic nature of these relative benefits makes it difficult for farmers to learn about the benefits of the technology which may hinder its widespread adoption even where we might objectively expect positive impacts from adoption for the successful diffusion of new agricultural technologies like dt and subt seeds it is important for researchers breeders policymakers and development practitioners to have a deeper understanding of farmers preferences for crop attributes this study aims to fill this gap by studying farmers preferences for dt and subt traits to date there has been relatively little effort to study the potential pathway by which these breeding developments may be translated into actual adoption 15 is the only other study making such an attempt among indian rice farmers for dt traits finding that farmers in drought prone areas of bihar india largely preferred dt cultivars to status quo their study also analyzed the role of behavioral parameters such as risk and loss aversion in contrast to their study the present study includes analysis of farmers preferences for both subt traits as well as dt traits in the context of odisha it is important to consider preferences for both types of stress tolerance since as noted above farmers in odisha are frequently exposed to both drought and flood risks we design a discrete choice experiment and complement the experiment with a separate survey to collect data on socioeconomic characteristics it is worth mentioning that although a few rice seed varieties tolerant to drought and submergence have been released in india the seeds are not widely available further many more are under various stages of development seed multiplication takes time and commercial availability on a large scale may take many years since there does not exist any market data for such seeds we employ a stated preference approach namely choice experiment widely used for economic valuation of non market goods to elicit farmers wtp for various attributes in rice seeds the next section presents empirical methodology section 3 describes data sources and section 4 presents results section 5 discusses the results and finally section 6 concludes 2 empirical methodology the study relies upon the use of discrete choice experiments to estimate farmers valuation for different seed traits in a choice experiment individuals are presented a series of hypothetical choice scenarios in which they must choose between bundles of different traits each taking one of a number of pre specified levels through statistical analysis of participants choices given the alternatives available in each choice scenario the researcher is able to estimate marginal values in either utility or monetary terms for the various attributes embodied in the alternatives researchers control the experimental choice environment by providing necessary variation in attribute levels which may not be present in the historical data the methodology is particularly useful for getting valuation of products that are yet not on the market for instance new technologies that are at a development stage there exists a very large literature employing choice experiments in the field of agricultural and resource economics some of the studies are provided below the methodology has been employed to analyze consumer preferences for environmental amenities 16 19 ecosystem services 20 22 food quality attributes 23 and new and improved production technologies 15 the use of choice experiments in india is relatively rare to date most stated choice studies in india have used the traditional contingent valuation approach for the valuation of new agricultural technologies 24 25 an important condition for the success of choice experiments is that respondents be able to relate to the options that are presented in this regard the choice scenarios with which participants are presented should closely resemble real world seed purchasing decisions they face on a regular basis in an attempt to satisfy this condition the seed attributes and their respective levels specified in our experiment were carefully chosen so that farmers could relate to them prior to designing the choice experiment we conducted a number of focus group discussions fgds with farmers in cuttack district of odisha to identify the attributes that are important to the farmers we also consulted the existing literature and met with rice scientists at crri central rice research institute cuttack odisha to decide attribute levels we also tried to ensure that respondents could understand and meaningfully relate to the options the choice sets and accompanying survey were translated into the local language oriya and the enumerators used the local language in interviewing participants visual illustrations were also used for better comprehension of the alternatives 2 1 attributes and levels through the course of the fgds farmers identified yield to be the most important trait for selecting a rice variety yields however are the result of stochastic processes so characterizing yields especially in light of these water stresses requires some finesse dalton et al 2011 used a novel approach to quantify the dt attribute in their study of kenyan farmers preferences for dt maize they described the attribute in terms of not only mean expected yield but also the variance of yield distribution under different moisture stress conditions the approach incorporates non monotonic nature of the relative benefits of dt variety 15 modified this approach in studying demand for dt rice among farmers in bihar india we have followed the basic approach of 15 to quantify dt in our study the dt attribute takes three levels related to different degrees of stochastic dominance over a popular local variety 2 2 swarna a popular rice variety in odisha that gives a yield of 53 quintals per hectare qtl ha under normal conditions 22 qtl ha under moderate drought stress and 6qtl ha under severe drought stress 26 has been considered as the reference variety in the first of these three levels the dt first order stochastically dominates the reference variety it yields higher under normal conditions under moderate drought stress conditions and under severe drought stress conditions in the second level the dt second order stochastically dominates the reference variety while it does not yield more nor less than the reference under normal conditions it has higher yields under both moderate and severe drought stress conditions in the third and final level the dt third order stochastically dominates the reference variety the dt yields no more nor less than the reference variety under normal and moderate drought stress conditions but it yields more under severe drought stress the yield distribution of sahbhagi dhan a recently released dt cultivar has informed our specification of yield distributions for different levels of stochastic dominance presented in our choice experiment 26 in order to explain the dt yield attribute to the respondents visual illustrations were used in the choice experiment each alternative depicted three levels of water stress and associated yield with them under the dt attribute the water stress was depicted by using pictures of water level in a water tank a tank that is full up to the rim indicates normal rainfall or no water stress a half filled tank indicates mild water stress and a tank with very little water indicates severe water stress the interviewer explained this to the respondents associated with each of the water stress levels there was a picture depicting the yield ranging from a green cover to a barren land along with a numerical value given in quintals hectare thus the dt attribute was communicated to the respondents in terms of the yield they could obtain under various water stress conditions 3 3 table 5 shows that less than 10 of the respondents ignored yield attribute suggesting that the respondents were able to comprehend the attribute we include subt as an attribute with three varying levels namely tolerance of 0 5 days 5 10 days and 10 15 days of full submergence our reference variety swarna can tolerate submergence for 0 5 days and a recently released subt rice variety swarna sub1 can tolerate submergence up to 15 days 4 4 in a series of field trials 44 found swarna sub1 to withstand submergence for up to 17 days given likely differences in conditions between agronomic field trial plots and farmer fields we have assumed a slightly reduced degree of tolerance during fgds farmers also indicated short duration to be an important attribute this represents another avenue through which breeding research can increase farmers resilience to droughts we have included three levels of crop duration short less than 120 days medium 120 135 days and long more than 135 days we have also included an attribute that distinguishes between seeds that can be stored and reused in the next season and those that cannot 5 5 most of the benefits that arise as a result of the hybridization process such as increased productivity and uniformity are fully expressed in first generation seeds but decline dramatically in subsequent generations therefore farmers must purchase new hybrid seeds every year in order to continually realize these benefits the seeds that can be stored and reused in the next season have a different impact on intertemporal income and random utility than the seeds that have to be purchased every year since purchasing seeds that cannot be stored entails incurring seed cost this year as well as farmers ability to have ready access to seeds in the future periods as a result of which seed costs have to be incurred every year in future 6 6 we thank the anonymous referee for pointing this out to us following the literature e g ward et al however in our choice experiment we have assumed seed reusability as an attribute whose value gets reflected in the wtp of seeds embodying such attribute thus in a way our choice experiment captures trade off between yield enhancing and yield variability reducing attributes in seeds in the current year and seed reusability in future years finally since we are ultimately interested in estimating money metric measures for willingness to pay wtp we incorporate an additional parameter capturing different prices to capture the price of inbreds as well as hybrids and to provide enough variation in seed price levels we have included six price levels ranging from rs 15 per kg to rs 300 per kg in the choice sets 7 7 the market price of hybrid rice is varying between rs 200 and rs 250 per kg in india 45 the attributes and various levels are summarized in table 1 there is a vast literature exploring the many issues pertinent to choice experiment design and many criteria by which such designs can be evaluated e g 27 28 using experimental design methods the rice seed attributes and their levels were combined into choice sets we used a blocked fractional factorial design which reduces the number of choice sets given to decision makers and efficiently estimates the utility parameters we constructed a d optimal experimental design based on a main effects only linear utility specification with null priors 16 29 30 this design generated 36 unique choice sets which were subsequently randomly allocated into four blocks of 9 choice sets each 8 8 d optimal designs minimize the d error of the design which is computed as the weighted determinant of the variance covariance matrix of the design where the weight is an exponential weight equal to the reciprocal of the number of parameters to be estimated the d efficiency and d error reported for our design are 5 1181 and 0 1954 respectively farmers in the sample were randomly allocated to each of these four blocks with a balanced number of farmers assigned to each of the four blocks each choice set contained three alternative hypothetical rice seeds plus a status quo option the status quo option is the rice seed the farmer used in the past rice season the information on the rice seed used in the past season and the data on its attributes was collected by the researchers through a primary survey the status quo for each farmer was then coded in terms of attribute s levels for the econometric analysis an example of a choice card presented to survey participants is shown in fig 1 our utility model flows from non separable agricultural household model where production decisions are guided by consumption and sale 31 9 9 in our sample approximately 34 of the total rice harvested during kharif and rabi season 2012 is sold for commercial purposes 36 is used for self consumption and the remaining 30 is kept as seed or used for other purposes such as gift wages etc the decision making framework relies on a trait based model of cultivar choice 32 note that when technology traits exhibit non pecuniary effects or give rise to nonseparability it becomes appropriate to use farmers technology adoption decisions within the framework of utility maximizing behavior wherein utility is maximized by choosing a combination of technology traits among a set of feasible alternatives 2 2 model econometric analysis of choice experiment data rests on the framework of random utility theory which describes discrete choices in a utility maximizing framework 33 10 10 utility maximization is one of a number of possible paradigms by which we can classify farmer behavior other paradigms include regret minimization lexicographic preferences and so on in what follows we will follow the assumption of 46 and 33 and assume that the process of utility maximization necessarily incorporates errors due to imperfect perception and optimization as well as the inability of the econometrician to exactly measure all of the relevant variables 47 the utility function will therefore be a random function with both a deterministic component and a stochastic component suppose that individual i faces j alternatives contained in choice set s during choice occasion t we can define an underlying latent variable v i j t that denotes the indirect utility associated with individual i s choosing option j s in choice occasion t for a fixed budget constraint random utility maximization implies that individual i will choose alternative j so long as v i j t v i q t q j the researcher does not directly observe v i j t but instead observes the choice made by the respondent denoted as v i j t where v i j t 1 if v i j t max v i 1 t v i 2 t v i j t and 0 otherwise following the standard assumption that utility for an alternative is a linear function of its characteristics 11 11 this implies that marginal utility is strictly monotonic in traits and gives rise to a corner solution in which only one product is purchased 32 we can write individual i s indirect utility function as 1 v i j t x i j t β ε i j t where x i j t is a vector of attributes for the j th alternative β is a vector of taste parameters that is a vector of weights mapping attribute levels into utility and ε i j t is a stochastic component of utility that is independent and identically distributed across individuals and alternative choices and takes a known distribution this stochastic component of utility captures unobserved variations in tastes as well as errors in the consumer s perceptions and optimization we assume that the random component of utility ε i j t follows a gumbel distribution then under the assumption that these terms are identically and independently distributed we can write our expression for the probability of observing alternative j chosen over all other alternatives conditional upon the observed levels of the attribute vector for all alternatives in the choice set s which gives us the basic conditional logit model and can be estimated using maximum likelihood the conditional logit framework assumes homogeneous preferences across respondents and independence of irrelevant alternatives 34 a common method of evaluating preference heterogeneity is estimation of random parameters logit rpl models the rpl is regarded as a highly flexible model that can approximate any random utility model and relaxes the limitations of the traditional conditional logit by allowing random taste variation within a sample according to a specified distribution and relaxes the assumption of independence from irrelevant alternatives 35 following 36 the probability that individual i chooses alternative j from the choice set s in situation t is given by 2 p r o b v i j t 1 x i 1 t x i 2 t x i j t ω e x p x i j t β i q 1 q e x p x i q t β i f β ω d β where β i is a vector of unknown taste parameters specific to individual i and the matrix ω defines the parameters characterizing the distribution of the random parameters the researcher is able to specify the families of these distributions and where necessary or advantageous impose restrictions on the distributions for our purposes we allow the coefficients corresponding to all attributes except price to vary normally while the price coefficient is fixed 12 12 since the wtp for an attribute is given by the ratio of the attribute coefficient to the price coefficient the wtp from a mixed logit model is given by the ratio of two randomly distributed terms depending on the choice of distributions for the coefficients this can lead to wtp distributions which are heavily skewed and that may not even have defined moments a common approach to dealing with this potential problem is to specify the price coefficient to be fixed this is a convenient assumption as in this case the distribution of the willingness to pay for an attribute is simply the distribution of the attribute coefficient scaled by the fixed price coefficient 48 given the utilitarian interpretation of our econometric specification the vector of parameters β i β i 1 β i 2 β i k defining tastes and preferences over the k attributes can be interpreted as marginal utilities and the ratio of two such marginal utilities is simply the marginal rate of substitution of one for the other if one of the included attributes say the k th attribute is the price of the alternative then β i k β k can be interpreted as the marginal utility of price or cost the negative of which is the marginal utility of income or money the marginal rate of substitution of money for each of the corresponding attributes that is wtp can be computed as 3 w t p i k β i k β k k 1 k 1 the marginal utility disutility for favorable unfavorable attributes will be positive negative indicating that the farmer is willing unwilling to substitute an increase in an attribute s expression for money 3 data sources the experiments and accompanying survey were conducted with farmers in three different districts of odisha in june july 2013 odisha is one of the largest rice producing and consuming states in india the state lies in eastern india and shares its coastline with the bay of bengal the topography of odisha is such that it contains both low lying coastal areas which frequently get flooded for prolonged periods and rainfed uplands that suffer from moisture stress due to variability in rainfall the districts included in the study were carefully chosen to include areas that suffer from droughts as well as those prone to prolonged floods we used a multi stage sampling approach to select our survey sample in the first stage we identified three adjacent districts in odisha that are susceptible to drought and or floods specifically we identified the districts dhenkanal cuttack and jagatsinghpur fig 2 the district of dhenkanal has been repeatedly affected by droughts including in recent years 2002 2005 2006 2008 and 2010 during 2008 it was estimated that more than 70 of total rice area in dhenkanal was adversely affected due to drought 37 dhenkanal is also one of the eight districts in odisha identified by the government of india for treatment under the drought prone area programme jagatsinghpur district situated along the bay of bengal on the eastern coast of odisha is prone to various natural hazards such as floods and cyclones the district has been severely affected by five major floods in the last 15 years the third district cuttack demonstrates a great deal of heterogeneity in terms of agro climatic conditions with some areas susceptible to droughts and others susceptible to floods in the second stage we stratified blocks sub district administrative units within cuttack and dhenkanal that were being affected by droughts the drought affected blocks drawn for the study are directly proportional to the population of each block as a proportion of total population of all the drought affected blocks within cuttack and dhenkanal similarly we stratified blocks among flood affected regions of cuttack and jagatsinghpur in this way we identified four blocks affected by droughts and four blocks affected by floods hereafter we will refer to these regions as drought prone and flood prone respectively we then selected two villages from each of these eight blocks using probability proportional to size sampling finally we randomly selected 25 rice growing households in each village from household lists provided by village leaders the resulting sample consisted of 400 rice growing households descriptive statistics of the sampled farmers are reported in table 2 while the second column presents the characteristics of the households in the pooled sample the third and fourth columns present and compare the characteristics of farmers in the drought prone and flood prone regions separately in our sample as compared with the households in the drought prone region the households in flood prone areas have higher mean annual income are more educated on average and have a higher proportion belonging to the general caste to get a sense of representativeness of our sample we also report summary statistics of available variables at the level of rural odisha and rural india in columns 5 and 6 the households in our sample as compared to households in rural odisha are more educated on average have a higher proportion of muslims a higher proportion of general caste and a larger proportion employed in agriculture and allied activities table 3 provides information on the distribution of the attributes of rice seeds used in the past rice season there were no farmers that were cultivating the drought tolerant variety many were cultivating the reference variety but there were also many farmers cultivating idiosyncratic landraces in any event the yields in alternatives still stochastically dominated farmers varieties 4 estimation and interpretation of results 4 1 econometric results if all respondents paid due attention to each and every attribute when evaluating the choice tasks then estimation of the taste parameters could proceed by simply estimating equation 2 by rpl these estimation results are reported in table 4 it however has been argued in the literature that some respondents may simplify the choice sets by ignoring one or more attributes characterizing the alternatives attribute nonattendance which if not controlled for results in significantly overestimated measures of wtp 38 attempted to infer attribute nonattendance from choice experiment data by making use of post estimation conditioning approaches if an attribute is serially ignored i e the respondent ignores the attribute in question across all choice tasks then its contribution to individual utility is zero both within and across choice scenarios which should be reflected by imposing restrictions on the parameter space for that particular individual we follow their approach for identifying nonattendance taking advantage of individual taste coefficients and variation estimated by conditioning the posterior mean marginal utility estimates on observed choices and choice experiment data the rpl model allows random taste heterogeneity by allowing marginal utility coefficients to be distributed randomly across respondents in the sample population the estimated parameters describe the distribution of β in the entire sample but do not provide any information on the likely location of a given individual on this distribution one could obtain more information on individual coefficients by conditioning on the observed choices for specific individuals this involves making a distinction between the distribution of β in the population unconditional distribution and the distribution of β in the subpopulation of people who faced the same alternatives and made the same choices yielding the conditional distribution g β j d a t a i ω this conditional distribution provides a straightforward method for estimating the expected marginal utility for each subpopulation that responds in a similar fashion when presented the same choice scenario e β i j d a t a i β j g β j d a t a i ω d β for notational simplicity in what follows we will use the notation β i j to indicate the posterior expectation of marginal utility for individual i and attribute j to identify attributes ignored by farmers we compute the coefficient of variation cv of the conditional distribution for each attribute level for all the 400 households 38 a high cv implies that the variation in stated preferences is excessive relative to the mean which makes the distribution noisy which may imply that the individual is in fact not attending to that particular attribute in his or her decision making process while the specification of this threshold is admittedly arbitrary we follow 38 and use a threshold cv of 2 to determine nonattendance table 5 summarizes the number of households with a cv greater than or equal to 2 for each attribute the attributes most often ignored in the pooled sample are medium duration and subt for 5 10 days followed by subt for 10 15 days for the drought prone region the highest number of households ignored the medium duration and subt for 10 15 days attributes again we can relate these results to statistically insignificant marginal valuations for these two attributes in the rpl estimates for the drought prone region finally somewhat ironically the attributes ignored by a large number of households in the flood prone region are subt for 5 10 days grains that cannot be stored and reused medium duration and subt for 10 15 days given that a considerable number of households ignored certain attributes we re estimate the rpl model by specifying the coefficient of marginal utility to be zero for ignored attributes in households utility functions the results of this constrained rpl model are presented in table 6 while the sample average wtp for the various attributes is reported in table 6 rpl results across the two regions are reported in the two right hand columns of table 6 separate estimation was done for each of the regions using 1800 observations for the sample of 200 farmers in each segment qualitatively the results are similar to those of the pooled sample marginal utility of attributes associated with dt technology is positive and significant in both the subsamples while the marginal utility for subt 5 10 days continues to be positive and highly significant in the drought prone region it becomes positive and highly significant for the flood prone region the marginal utility associated with subt 10 15 days continues to be insignificant for the drought prone area but becomes positive and significant for the flood prone region there is considerably high marginal utility for the short duration attribute in both regions although marginal utilities cannot be directly compared across the two groups due to potential differences in scale effect wtp can be since scale effects are eliminated it is worth noting that the valuations are consistently higher for all the attributes in the flood prone region as compared with the drought prone region with the ironic sole exception of subt for 5 10 days the difference in valuations is remarkably large for the short duration attribute and for having to purchase new seed every year as we will later show this result will have a bearing on the wtp estimates in the two regions 4 2 willingness to pay table 7 reports willingness to pay estimates on average farmers have a positive and statistically significant wtp for the productivity increasing as well as risk reducing attributes associated with dt technology in the drought prone sample the wtp for the first order stochastic dominant fsd yield distribution is larger than the wtp for the second order stochastic dominant ssd yield distribution which is in turn higher than the wtp for the third order stochastic dominant tsd yield distribution 13 13 it should be noted however that the sample average wtp estimates are not statistically distinct from one another in the flood prone sample however the wtp for the third order stochastically dominant tsd yield distribution is actually higher than the wtp for the other two distributions farmers in the flood prone areas therefore are willing to pay a higher premium for seeds that reduce their exposure to severe droughts while not necessarily demanding an increase in expected yields yields under normal conditions or less variability farmers in the flood prone sample have on average a positive wtp for long term submergence tolerance though the average wtp is only statistically significant at the 10 level in drought prone areas the coefficient for 5 10 days submergence tolerance is positive and significant however the coefficient of submergence tolerance 10 15 days is negative but insignificant the latter may appear as an unexpected finding as one would expect a positive and a larger coefficient for the 10 15 days submergence tolerance one possible explanation could be because that those residing in drought prone areas may not perceive susceptibility to floods of such a prolonged duration as to not justify a large valuation in other words they may not derive any utility from a trait from which they do not expect to ever reap a benefit not surprisingly we find positive significant and considerably high marginal utility for the short duration attribute there are various possible reasons for this first short duration provides a means of escaping the abiotic stress drought or flood if droughts arise due to rainfall deficiencies at the two ends of the growing season that is due to late monsoon onset or early monsoon cessation short duration allows farmers to either delay transplanting in the case of delayed monsoon onset or harvest a fully mature crop without creeping into rabi season land preparation second short duration may allow farmers to grow another short duration crop between the kharif and rabi crops these crops are typically higher value horticultural crops which provide increased farm incomes as well as income diversification third short duration rice may provide farmers with a window of time in which to pursue nonagricultural income short duration varieties can also help in alleviating the hunger period the pre harvesting period when typically food availability is low and prices are high if some crops mature earlier they can provide food in this period our results suggest that if seeds that produce grains that cannot be stored and reused as seed in the next season have no yield advantage then farmers would demand a high discount to cultivate them however the hybrids available in markets are often more expensive than the open pollinated varieties this may be because hybrids usually have high yield potential embodied in them and thus the price of hybrids that we see in actual markets reflects valuation for yield improvement and other benefits conferred in them discounted by the lack of seed reusability trait 14 14 while hybrids largely confer higher and more uniform yields at lower seeding rates than varieties i e a lower quantity of seed is required to cultivate a given area hybrid seeds must be purchased anew every year for the benefits to be observed 15 under each partition the parameters are estimated separately so it is possible to reach different determinations about ana based on the particular sub sample estimates and therefore the numbers from the two sub samples may not add to the number from the pooled sample 4 3 demand curves we can use the estimated coefficients from the rpl model to calculate aggregate demand for new seeds with specified attributes using the sample enumeration technique the probability of choosing different alternatives is predicted for each individual by using the estimated coefficients in conjunction with equation 2 the predicted share of the sample choosing different alternatives is then obtained by summing over these probabilities the demand for alternative j denoted by d j is given by 4 d j i 1 n p r o b v i j t 1 x j β ˆ where β ˆ denotes coefficients estimated from the rpl model and n denotes the number of individuals in the sample to get a share the demand is divided by the number of individuals in the sample different demand functions are generated by varying the vector of observable attributes x j keeping the parameter estimates β ˆ unchanged suppose for example we are considering introduction of two alternative new seeds called a 1 and a 2 seed a 1 has properties similar to sahbhagi dhan it is a short duration inbred variety with yields along the lines of the fsd distribution introduced earlier seed a 2 has properties similar to swarna sub1 it is a medium duration inbred rice variety that can tolerate being submerged for up to 15 days fig 3 illustrates the predicted demand vis à vis status quo if one of these seeds was introduced in the pooled sample as the price of the new seed varies from rs 50 per kg to rs 1000 per kg the continuous curve and the dashed curve depict demand for a 1 and a 2 respectively and each curve depicts the percentage of farmers who would choose the new seed at various prices as expected the demand curves slope downward indicating that as the price increases a smaller proportion of farmers would be likely to purchase the seed clearly the demand for seed type a 1 is higher than that of seed type a 2 fig 4 illustrates the demand curves for a 1 and a 2 in drought prone and flood prone regions respectively the continuous curve represents percentage of farmers that would adopt a 1 vis à vis the status quo in the drought prone region while the dashed curve depicts the percentage of farmers that would adopt a 2 vis à vis the status quo in flood prone regions again the figure illustrates that the demand for the seed having subt attribute is low even in the flood prone region 4 4 socio economic characteristics using various versions of rpl model we tried to explore the reasons for heterogeneous preferences of farmers by interacting rice seed attributes with farmers socio economic characteristics such as income caste etc we find that different groups of farmers have different valuation for these new and improved technologies more specifically while the high income farmers have a higher valuation for yield enhancing fsd submergence tolerance short duration attributes the lower income farmers highly value ssd tsd and seed reusability attributes further the non scheduled groups have a higher valuation for almost all rice seed attributes as compared to scheduled caste groups one of the limitations while running separate rpl regressions interacting with income and caste is that in each regression we have potentially confounded effects i e we cannot isolate the effects of income from that of caste in each regression because scheduled caste households are likely to belong to the lower income group 5 discussion the results suggest that on average farmers in the pooled sample are willing to pay a significant premium for dt technologies the different valuations for the three yield distributions illustrated here suggest that while farmers value reductions in yield variability and protection against downside risk they may not be willing to sacrifice higher expected yields to attain these this result is close to 15 and 39 in their analysis of farmers preferences for different yield distributions in rice seeds in bihar india and maize seeds in kenya respectively farmers also highly value short duration rice as well as being able to store grain and use it as seed in subsequent seasons qualitatively the results are similar for the subsamples of drought prone and flood prone regions however the wtp for most attributes is considerably higher in the flood prone region than in the drought prone region which reflects the socioeconomic differences in households from the two regions households in flood prone areas on average have higher mean incomes are more educated and are more likely to belong to the general caste it should be duly noted that while we made efforts to ensure the respondents treated the choice scenarios as they would real world purchasing decisions these wtp estimates are likely biased upward due to the hypothetical nature of the choice exercise while many observers are generally of the opinion that farmers appreciate improvements in seed technologies and would be willing to pay a premium for these improvements the marginal wtp estimates in the odisha samples seem perhaps unreasonably high since we have no alternative but to assume that the observed choices are reflective of farmers true preferences given the options they are confronted with and that the valuations are at least consistent with preference orderings if not of the exact monetary scale that farmers would actually pay a robust result from our study is that the valuation for the dt technology is significantly higher than the valuation for the subt technology our characterization of dt and subt traits may have a bearing on this while we have characterized dt in terms of yield distributions under different moisture stress conditions subt is described in terms of number of days of submergence that crops can tolerate the cognitive burden associated with the dt attribute is probably greater than the one associated with the subt attribute these differences in characterization might have influenced the choice process another robust result from the study is high valuation for the short duration rice by cultivating a short duration variety farmers can escape droughts and floods however our results suggest that farmers value the short duration variety even beyond its ability to escape abiotic stresses in addition farmers cultivating short duration rice are able to supplement their income by either cultivating a short duration vegetable crop after harvesting their kharif rice or by taking advantage of non agricultural opportunities after the kharif harvest some studies conducted in africa and asia have investigated adoption and farmers valuation for improved seeds that have dt attribute 40 survey farm households in six african countries to measure dt maize adoption rates and their determinants they find considerable inter country variation in farmer adoption of dt maize ranging from 9 in zimbabwe to 61 in malawi the major barriers to adoption include unavailability of improved seed lack of awareness and understanding about its benefits lack of resources and high seed price 39 use a choice experiment to elicit wtp for dt attribute in maize seeds in eastern kenya using a latent class model they find the wtp to be highly heterogeneous and the wtp of the segment having the highest wtp was consistent with observed market price for hybrid seeds 41 investigate low adoption of improved sorghum varieties in ethiopia their results suggest that risk factors coupled with access to markets and social capital drive farmers decision to adopt improved varieties of sorghum in a discrete choice experiment study conducted in bangladesh 42 find that farmers are not willing to adopt a dt rice variety without substantial financial incentives such as subsidies however the marginal utility of dt rice increases if the seed is bundled with insurance 6 conclusion abiotic stresses such as droughts and floods lead to significant income and consumption losses for rice growing farmers in india rice seed varieties that have better tolerance to moisture stress conditions and submergence have the potential to protect farmers livelihoods the objective of this study was to estimate farmers valuations for drought and submergence tolerance characteristics in rice seeds using a discrete choice experiment methodology for 400 rice growing farmers in three districts of odisha we find considerable heterogeneity in the farmers valuations for various attributes in rice seeds and thus we report results from an rpl model in the reported results we have accounted for attribute nonattendance we find that farmers in both drought prone and submergence prone regions are generally willing to pay a significant premium for a reduction in yield variability offered by the new rice varieties however only farmers in flood prone areas are willing to pay for rice that can withstand being submerged for prolonged periods the valuation for the dt technology is significantly higher than the valuation for the subt technology farmers also highly value short duration rice as well as seed reusability the valuation for most traits is considerably higher in the flood prone region the results from our study are useful for researchers developing these new technologies in determining the traits they should focus on they are also useful in guiding public and private sector investment in the development and delivery of such technologies our results suggest the existence of naturally occurring market segments in particular the result that farmers in both drought prone and flood prone areas are willing to pay for seed technologies that provide protection against droughts suggests that all farmers even those not residing in designated drought prone areas perceive susceptibility to droughts this may be a result specific to odisha in which many areas have historically endured prolonged dry spells furthermore much of odisha has precariously little irrigation infrastructure with which to buffer production during these dry spells a different story emerges altogether when we consider potential markets for subt varieties such as swarna sub1 farmers in drought prone areas are very clearly not willing to pay for protection from prolonged floods and so would not be a viable market place for such products there does appear to be potential demand for subt products in flood prone areas but the marginal wtp for protection against prolonged submergence is small in comparison with the marginal wtp for other traits such as shorter duration this perhaps suggests that while farmers in flood prone areas might be aware that floods are a threat to their production floods of such a prolonged duration are sufficiently rare as to not justify a large valuation while there is a positive valuation this is perhaps a cautionary note about the potential success of marketing a product like swarna sub1 our estimation results also depict considerable heterogeneity in the preferences of farmers for attributes like short duration medium duration seed reusability and yield variability future research can explore the role of socioeconomic and behavioral factors causing this heterogeneity and of policy interventions that ensure that new technologies are accessible to all sections of society funding source this work was funded by the united states agency for international development usaid and the bill and melinda gates

8714,aquifer overdraft is a key public concern in arid and semiarid regions where agriculture is responsible of most of the water extraction to tackle this problem policy interventions in those regions most frequently focus on investment in irrigation technologies however these investments are usually carried out without consideration of the effects on water extraction estimation of such effects tend to be expensive and time consuming because they vary depending on technology and location specific conditions and their interactions thus there is the demand for methodologies that can provide cheaper estimates even if rough this paper explores whether an expert elicitation can provide insights on the impacts that are reasonable to expect from specific efficient irrigation technologies our case study is the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes mexico where extraction is more than 80 above of the natural recharge we have learned that our experts in agronomy and hydrology do not expect that sprinkler or drip technologies will substantially reduce overdraft these results are policy relevant because both types of technologies are at center of the strategies proposed by the policy makers aiming to solve aquifer overdraft in aguascalientes keywords aquifer overdraft efficient irrigation technologies expert elicitation aguascalientes 1 introduction aquifer overdraft is a concern in arid and semiarid countries particularly in those countries where urban areas keep growing and economic activities such as agriculture exert most of the pressure on groundwater 32 36 for instance gleeson et al 22 document aquifer depletion in the northern regions of america china africa central and southern asia with effects in the availability and quality of water ecosystems and land damages and rising costs for all uses of water standard policy advice from economists is based on water pricing or electricity pricing aware of the lack of political feasibility of price mechanisms economists have proposed other incentive based instruments aside from pricing one alternative is an innovative intervention known as decoupled subsidies which consists in substituting subsidized electricity or water for a direct payment 3 4 19 in spite of their theoretical appeal they tackle economic sustainability and political feasibility concerns decoupled subsidies have also been difficult to implement due to political equilibria 45 46 48 1 1 in mexico a decoupled subsidy was created farmers were offered the choice choice between a conventional electricity subsidy and a cash payment due to complexity and uncertainty regarding the future effects of the decoupled subsidy they were afraid they could lose rights to their water allocation the program failed personal communication with decision makers that negotiated the program farmers lobbies decision makers from agriculture departments and politicians when challenged with sustainability issues tend to favor supply side policies such as irrigation technology investment which at least in theory aims to reduce water extraction per unit of product irrigation investment is presented frequently as a course of action to tackle two goals i reduction of groundwater extraction and ii support to the agricultural sector 31 however there is evidence of a much more complex relation between water extraction irrigation technology and aquifer depletion 39 43 52 efficient irrigation may result in intensive use of water or expansion of cultivated area which conflict with the objective of using less water 41 44 52 in spite of the complex relationship between irrigation efficiency and aquifer depletion there is evidence that at least transitions from very inefficient systems flood to higher efficiency systems center pivot sprinkler or subsurface drip reduce water use 43 many regions in developing countries including central mexico are currently transitioning from very inefficient systems to potentially very efficient ones in this context having an estimate of the effects of projected irrigation investments on groundwater extraction is a key piece of information for planners the problem is that the effects are context dependent and therefore difficult to obtain giordano et al 21 for instance simulates a complex socioeconomic model to obtain an estimation on the other hand field measurement is costly and time consuming as a first step to develop a methodology that aims to help in the design and evaluation of water policy interventions we explore whether data gathered through an expert elicitation are useful to gain insights on the expected impacts of efficient irrigation interventions expert elicitation encompasses an array of strategies to systematically gather process and summarize scientific and technical judgments from a relatively small group of experts who express their opinions in a quantitative manner 8 15 18 38 by obtaining quantitative data as opposed to obtaining only qualitative data expert elicitation is a piece of empirical research that enhances decision making processes thus expert elicitation is regarded as particularly useful when other empirical data is limited unreliable or expensive either in monetary terms or time wise or both 30 in addition the implementation of a rigorous expert elicitation is considered an important dimension of assessment exercises in contexts where uncertainty is large 34 while the precision of the estimates obtained via an expert elicitation might be lower compared to more expensive and time consuming approaches we argue the figures are a sensible guide to policy makers in charge of chosing the interventions to address groundwater withdrawal concerns we do not wish to argue that expert elicitation is a stand alone methodology ideally the rough estimates obtained via expert elicitation can be used in a complementary manner with other methodologies e g modelling strategies that require calibration of parameters we take as case study the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes located in central mexico because it illustrates the problems usually found in arid and semiarid regions of developing countries as other arid cities in mexico and other parts of the world aguascalientes extracts from its aquifer almost double the volume of the natural recharge mainly to fulfill agriculture demand due to political lobbying most of the efforts and money to tackle water issues are channeled through water infrastructure investments mainly irrigation modernization water pipelines sprinkler and drop irrigation decisions are made without a clear estimation of the effects of the policies in section 2 we present challenges specific to the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes and how it illustrates more general concerns in sections 3 and 4 we explain the expert elicitation methodology and the protocol used in this study in section 5 we present the aggregated opinions from our experts regarding the effects of efficient irrigation technologies on aquifer extraction in section 6 we discuss the policy implications of our findings section 7 concludes 2 case study area in this section we make the point that the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes is illustrative for our purposes because i it is under overdraft conditions ii the policy makers in charge of conserving the groundwater in aguascalientes are seriously considering the possibility of implementing policy interventions encouraging the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies and iii despite the popularity of such interventions their effects on groundwater extraction are not clear yet 2 1 irrigation and water extraction in the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes according to the mexican constitution both surface water and groundwater belong to the nation and as such the bulk water used by each municipality is granted by the national water commission conagua each type of user e g agriculture industrial pays a price for its consumption in accordance with the federal law of rights agriculture users pay zero pesos unless they exceed their allowance the state of aguascalientes fulfills its water demand using 29 of surface water and 71 of groundwater as shown in table 1 in aguascalientes a volume of 618 4 cubic hectometers hm3 per year is granted by conagua to all different users from both surface and ground waters the agriculture sector is the highest consumptive user with a water allocation of 481 8 hm3 78 of the total consumptive use the urban and domestic sectors are granted together 122 hm3 20 and the industrial sector is granted 14 6 hm3 2 12 groundwater is withdrawn mostly from the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes 2 2 based on its geography and hydro geological function the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes is part of an inter state aquifer the ojocaliente aguascalientes encarnación aquifer which crosses the states of zacatecas aguascalientes and zacatecas because many substantive decisions are made at the state level official figures are produced based on the intersection of the inter state and the political boundaries being the valle de aguascalientes one of the three resulting aquifers one of the five aquifers that cross the state boundaries fig 1 according to conagua 10 the volume of extraction from the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes is 430 hm3 according to the same official source the average natural recharge is of 235 hm3 making the withdrawal from the aquifer more than 80 above the sustainable level of extraction as of december 20th 2013 when official figures were released the five aquifers of aguascalientes were classified as under deficit or with negative availability the calculations and discussion presented in this paper refer to the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes where more than 95 of the population and economic activity of the state is located aguascalientes shares a challenge with other mexican states in the central and northern areas of the country how to manage an over exploited aquifer to fulfill the water demand from its growing population which grows at a rate of around 2 annually and booming industrial sectors in 2014 official figures estimated a state gdp growth rate of 11 17 by far the highest rate of all the 32 mexican states while keeping the supply to its irrigated agriculture sector as most mexican states where political factors deter decision makers from managing water resources using demand side mechanisms 6 23 29 3 3 even though the city of aguascalientes is one of the cities with higher participation of the private sector participation in domestic water provision the water pricing structure is not very dynamic and the price ranges are similar to other cities agriculture use of water is regulated by the federation currently there is no fee for agriculture use of water and the energy to pump irrigation water is highly subsidized water management delves around water supply investments ranging from irrigation technologies to artificial aquifer injection and plans for inter basin water transfers most of the irrigated agriculture in aguascalientes is developed in the irrigation district 01 located in the municipality pabellón de arteaga north of the municipality of aguascalientes and a few kilometers from the main metropolitan area 4 4 with a population slightly above 1 million 300 thousand inhabitants 27 the central state aguascalientes is one of the less populated states in mexico the twenty seventh out of thirty two entities but the metropolitan area which includes the capital city of aguascalientes 310 miles north from mexico city concentrates around 90 of the state s population ranking as the fourteenth most populated city in the country within an urban system of 384 urban areas classified as cities by the national council of population 14 the irrigation district 01 comprises a total surface of 10 396 hectares has of which 3 992 are irrigated with 33 6 hm3 according to conagua 12 outside of the irrigation district 01 there are around 3 500 has dedicated to agriculture for a total of 7 591 has of cultivated land of which 7 179 has are irrigated the main crops cultivated by about 2 744 users are maize and alfalfa about half of the cultivated area is irrigated with irrigation wells and another half using water from dams mostly from the plutarco elías calles dam technological investment at irrigation district 01 is a salient infrastructure project considered in the current state administration in his inaugural address speech on december 1st 2016 governor martín orozco made five pledges related to specific major infrastructure projects to be implemented during his six year administration three were related to urban mobility one to urban ecosystem restoration and one was to invest in modern irrigation technologies for 100 of the cultivated area in the irrigation district 01 5 5 according to the state government s development plan 2016 2022 a document that sets the guidelines of an administration every six years as mandated by the state constitution at the beginning of the administration the modernization of the irrigation district 01 had a progress of 75 this illustrates the salience of the investment compared to any other policy issue and it highlights the relevance of estimating the effect on aquifer depletion 2 2 political dynamics explaining the salience of irrigation investments in the mexican water policy under no political constraints price mechanisms are advised to deal with scarcity problems a realistic advice however considers that political actors use their resources to get benefits while avoiding most of the costs while supply side alternatives are less politically contentious compared to demand side alternatives with the exception of the highly contentious water transfer projects each alternative has supporters and opponents which tilts the balance to specific alternatives beyond their objective contribution to the scarcity problem still this does not necessarily explain the salience of irrigation infrastructure as a way to tackle water policy issues theoretically in a policy situation where the alternatives are forced to be on the water supply side politicians could calculate the optimal portfolio of water investments assuming it is possible to determine the effect of each measure on water consumption however in aguascalientes case decisions seemingly recur quickly to big infrastructure projects without considering the estimated impact on desirable outcomes either aquifer conservation or agriculture production we argue below that the salience of these kind of investments hinges on the features of the mexican political system firstly planning horizons are determined by the executive branch term six years in the case of state governors without reelection the one term limit induce governors for whom water is a salient issue to devote their resources both financial and political to major infrastructure projects that increase substantially water supply in a single six year term secondly the available alternatives are set by the state government but with high influence from the federal government where the president faces also one term only periods and seeks important projects in a single term in most of the major investments the cost is shared by both levels of government the federation leads the states toward a given direction using matching funds investment conditions this is an important financial incentive to build big infrastructure projects thirdly an evidence based model of policy making requires quality data and intensive analysis capabilities to compete with politics driven decision making in the case of states depending mostly on groundwater the data and the analysts are very scarce specific to our case of study information on the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes is expensive and scattered since 1971 there have been four major studies to measure water availability in the aquifer and some require expensive and sophisticated analyses 10 6 6 the report is official information by conagua the mexican federal government s water agency the second to last study from 1996 included a detailed analysis of the state of all wells in the region the case in other cities is likely to be even more difficult our experts consider that the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes is one the most studied in the country these conditions explain that the water policy efforts are usually focused on a few investment projects both at the state and federal level in mexico often large programs are carried out without evidence of their outcomes the largest hydrological project of the state administration 2010 2016 was the artificial recharge of the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes according to the state government s inagua the cost of the project was 145 million pesos from the federal budget equivalent to roughly 8 million dollars in 2017 plus 60 million pesos more than 3 million dollars from the state government s budget and a yearly operation cost of 20 million pesos more than 1 million dollars according to conagua 53 aquifer injection in aguascalientes could provide 0 43 hm3 from 2012 in 2018 in contrast sprinkler irrigation could save 7 81 hm3 through decreasing aquifer extraction 53 however no evidence about the actual effect from the artificial recharge has been provided during our workshop the participants unanimously concluded that the artificial recharge had not accomplished the goal of providing water in a sustainable manner and they pointed out that academics from the state university universidad autónoma de aguascalientes uaa were concerned about the usefulness and technical viability of the investment a crucial input to water decision making focused on reducing aquifer depletion is to identify the contribution of major projects to the reduction of water consumption and extraction if a major water project is about to absorb most financial resources a necessary step is to estimate the effects from each alternative under consideration in the political agenda the distribution of effort and money to fulfill water demand under the conditions described above has been a perennial concern in aguascalientes and other mexican states we contribute with a method to estimate the contribution of a policy alternative to a specific goal i e the reduction of aquifer depletion under time budget and information constraints 3 methodology in this section we motivate the implementation of an expert elicitation protocol to inform policy makers in aguascalientes then we briefly describe the steps to design an expert elicitation protocol in doing so we provide instances referring to our application but it is in section 4 that we present a detailed description of the expert elicitation protocol developed for this study 3 1 why do we use expert elicitation in section 2 we have described a context in which policy makers in charge of groundwater are considering the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies however they have not been informed with estimates of the potential effects of such technologies on groundwater extraction in this context the calculation preferably in no time and at a low cost of such estimates is essential to inform the decision making process here is where expert elicitation ee comes into play ee encompasses an array of strategies to systematically gather process and summarize scientific and technical judgments from a relatively small group of experts 8 15 18 38 economists regularly use expert judgment as complementary information in issues such as gdp growth inflation and unemployment ee collects data that can be analyzed quantitatively e g data for which a mean and standard deviation can be calculated in order to extract as quantitative information as possible a precise question must be in place e g what rate of unemployment can we expect next year is preferred over will the unemployment rate be worse next year 7 7 experts can also be requested to respond in qualitative terms to questions that are quantitative in nature for instance do you think that unemployment will increase next year to this question an expert can answer yes or no although the percentage of experts thinking that there will be more unemployment can be calculated the information obtained in this way is not enough to learn how bad unemployment will be next year ee aims to extract quantitative data that answers in this context the specific question of what rate of unemployment can we expect for next year the key difference of ee with respect to other methods of consulting with experts e g semi structured interviews is that ee requests experts to answer in numerical terms by obtaining quantitative data as opposed to obtaining only qualitative data ee is a piece of empirical research that enhances decision making processes this is why ee is particularly useful when other empirical data is limited unreliable or expensive either in monetary terms or time wise or both 30 the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes is a good example of the need of timely analysis to inform policy makers this aquifer has been studied by several long term studies and pilot studies of all sorts due to the presence of national research centers such as the headquarters of inegi the internationally renowned mexican institute for geography and statistics and a chapter of inifap the national institute for forestry agriculture and livestock research which produces relevant valuable scientific research and data as well as high quality education institutions such as the state university uaa notwithstanding the number of studies on the aquifer a diagnostic by a research group from the uaa has documented that given the lack or the deficiency of the piezometric data and other relevant information it is not possible to characterize the functioning and the status of the aquifer and more technical studies have been recommended 50 in a more recent research effort inegi aimed to model behavior of the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes using system dynamics techniques which allow analysts to feed the model with real data and test different policy interventions 28 a team from inegi s department of geography and environment has been working on the model for more than four years the advantage of the ee approach is that an approximation can be produced in a short time and it is able to provide inputs for other approaches such as inegi s model where some parameters are fed into the model from strong assumptions that might be more meaningful if substituted with estimates obtained via an ee 3 2 expert elicitation design a brief description bosetti et al 8 break the design of an ee protocol down into eight steps these steps are carried out in an iterative manner and thus practitioners may return to a specific step several times in the first step the research team defines the elicitation s goal and the mode of elicitation the goal of an elicitation must be unambiguous in terms of the metric that experts are requested to use when reporting the parameter of interest for instance one goal of our elicitation is to learn expert s best conjecture about the current level of annual groundwater extraction and experts have been requested to express their expectations in h m 3 the elicitation mode refers to the mechanism chosen to administer the ee protocol elicitation modes range from face to face interviews to protocols that can be self administered via a web based platform the selection of the specific mode is not without trade offs see refs 5 51 for details on this in this application we have chosen to gather all our experts together in a single session and present them to the elicitation protocol simultaneously via a seminar format we elaborate on this decision in section 4 1 in the second step of an ee design the research team identifies an initial set of individuals with experience in the area s of knowledge under which the research question falls details on the expertise required for this application are provided in section 4 2 these experts are contacted to explore their availability and willingness to participate in the ee at this stage it is important that the elicitation s goal is clear and precise enough to be explained to the experts who may decline their participation if the goal is not clear or relevant this initial set of experts may latter be trimmed due to i a more precise definition of the required knowledge and or ii the unavailability or unwillingness of a number of experts to participate in the ee in the third step the research team decides the format of the elicitation question the format determines the measure that experts report during the elicitation for instance experts may report the mean or median of the parameter of interest e g ref 49 or percentiles characterizing the distribution of the parameter under analysis e g refs 33 47 also experts may be presented to questions that can only receive answers that are dichotomous in nature e g when presented to alternatives designed according to a discrete choice experiment 2 or when presented to questions that can only receive yes no answers 35 in this study we implement the double dichotomous format suggested by ref 35 we elaborate on this decision in section 4 5 in the fourth step experts receive background material and are trained in the rationale behind the elicitation question this step may be carried out in advance to the implementation of the protocol or as a preliminary step during the elicitation session we chose the second option and elaborate on this decision in section 4 1 in the fifth step the ee protocol is tuned by piloting parts or the entire protocol in this step it is important to make sure that the metric of interest is clear to the experts and that hypothetical scenarios are understood by experts we piloted parts of our protocol mainly focusing on the different versions of the expert elicitation questions the sixth step consist in the gathering of opinions from the experts via the elicitation protocol as detailed in section 4 3 the statistical analysis of the gathered data is the seventh step details are provided in section 4 6 the final step consists in reporting the summary of the experts opinions which we do in section 5 next section provides the specifics of the ee protocol developed in the context of this study 4 expert elicitation protocol 4 1 goal number of experts elicitation mode and implementation the goal of our ee protocol is twofold we first aim to gather and summarize the opinion of experts about the volume of underground water that will be extracted in 2020 for agricultural use from the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes the second goal is to collect the opinion of experts on whether the extraction of underground water can be reduced through specific policy scenarios aiming to increase the irrigation efficiency in the agricultural sector we set 2020 as year of reference because 2020 has frequently been used in prospective studies in mexico also we are interested in delivering results that can be used as soon as possible to inform public policies given that the planing horizons in mexico are determined by the executive branch then we set our year of interest to the year where the state administration which began in 2016 is expected to make their case on the delivery of their policies six experts responded to our protocol this number of respondents may appear small to readers who are not familiar with the ee literature actually six is a reasonable number of experts clemen and winkler 9 argue that the marginal value of an additional expert decreases substantially after three to four experts to put our number of experts in context consider the 28 ee studies reviewed by bosetti et al 8 among these studies the minimum number of experts is three and the maximum is 55 and 50 of these studies consulted 8 experts or less indeed a reader acquainted with empirical quantitative methodologies may wonder whether there are enough degrees of freedom in these data to carry out conditional analysis as pointed out by bosetti et al 8 the concept of statistical significance supported by efficient standard errors is not the most appropriate in this context the first reason is that the opinions from experts are correlated to some extent because they share a common set of background information the second reason is that we aim to collect and summarize the opinions of the experts goal that can be accomplished by calculating mean and standard deviation of the experts opinions we do not aim for instance to infer the determinants of underground water extraction all six experts attended a 6 h workshop held on march 19th 2016 at the centro de investigacion y docencia economicas cide campus region centro located in aguascalientes city during the first hour of the workshop experts were informed of the structure of the questions the elicitation s goal and received information about the conditions of the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes we were careful not to provide cues on what were the expected effects of particular policies on the outcome of interest to avoid biased responses the information on the aquifer levels of extraction were presented to test whether all agreed on the deficit between natural recharge and extraction and to highlight that the variable of interest was water extraction at this stage experts were encouraged to discuss about the background information provided by the facilitators thus experts pointed out information and sources not mentioned by the facilitator and expressed agreement or disagreement with specific pieces of the information some questioned the accuracy of the exact levels of extraction from official sources due to measurement concerns but agreed that a precise figure was not known still the experts agreed that the extraction was higher than natural recharge and that reducing the deficit was a valuable policy goal in addition experts were encouraged to discuss about the policy interventions that in their opinion would decrease the extraction of underground water in the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes during the second and third hour of the workshop the experts responded the elicitation questions these questions were presented on a screen visible to all six experts answered via a web based platform in an independent way i e experts were not allowed to exchange points of view at this stage experts were introduced to the structure of the elicitation questions through questions that elicited opinions about an unrelated topic e g migration policies during the last two hours of the workshop the experts were encouraged to i provide comments on the ee protocol ii identify policies that may be worth discussing in a future workshop and iii identify the political and other type of obstacles to the successful implementation of the interventions under discussion 4 2 the expertise of our experts for purposes of this study an expert is an individual whose professional career is closely related to water management and the agricultural sector in aguascalientes with a particular interest on irrigation district 01 see section 2 more specifically experts in this study have accumulated knowledge about the factors impacting extraction of underground water for agricultural use in aguascalientes and how specific technologies and cropping practices perform in aguascalientes the way experts are selected determines the opinions that are collected for instance if experts are all academic researchers the type of gathered knowledge may miss the specific knowledge acquired by field technicians in fact meyer and booker 37 recommends the selection of a diverse pool of experts to avoid as much as possible the cognitive heuristic known as anchoring i e the documented tendency of people to not adjust sufficiently from an initial reference value 38 thus keeping in mind our expertise requirements and aiming to cover a wide enough range of opinions we first put together a list of 15 individuals in doing so we were assisted by the legal director of the state water institute the 15 experts were contacted via e mail and invited to participate in a workshop in which they would be requested to respond to an elicitation protocol the goal of the protocol was explained to them and initial background information was provided twelve experts attended the workshop six of these experts have knowledge on water extraction for residential and industrial purposes this paper reports opinions of the six experts with knowledge on water extraction for agricultural use two of our experts work at the state water institute inagua two experts are private consultants one is academic researcher and on is a farmer the two consultants are agronomists the academic researcher who provided valuable qualitative insights holds a phd on earth science and specializes in geo hydrology the two experts working at the governmental agency are civil engineers 4 3 expert elicitation procedure experts judgments are elicited via a four step procedure which is schematically summarized in fig 2 in the first step experts receive background information this information includes the explanation of the elicitation s goal and the description of the 2020 scenario in the second step experts report the volume of underground water that in their opinion will be extracted for agricultural use in 2020 8 8 we have chosen 2020 as year of reference because i it is the year commonly used for short term prospective studies in mexico and ii the administration should be able to make a case on the delivery of their policies about four years after the state government inauguration in this case 2016 experts are told to assume 2020 conditions as described in step 1 in the third step the facilitator describes one of the four policy scenarios under study in step 4 experts report their expectations about the reduction in water extraction attainable under the policy scenario presented in step 3 the next two sections describe in detail the 2020 scenario the four policy scenarios and our elicitation question 4 4 efficient irrigation scenarios experts cannot provide unconditional judgments they need to be informed about the conditions under which they are requested to forecast groundwater extraction thus we first provide a 2020 scenario described in terms of population in aguascalientes and average annual temperature population is set at 1 4 million people which is the expected population in 2020 according to the national council of population the population in 2016 was 1 31 million people 13 the average annual temperature was described as increasing by 1 6 c which is the upper bound of the temperature expected in aguascalientes according to the national institute of ecology and climate change 26 the efficient irrigation scenarios aim to capture the most salient alternatives discussed in the political arena in aguascalientes thus we design four scenarios closely resembling those proposed by the national water agency in a report that identified the gaps between water supply and water demand 11 the first scenario describes 100 of the cultivated area in the irrigation district 01 as irrigated using sprinklers the second scenario describes 50 of the cultivated area in the irrigation district 01 as irrigated using sprinklers and the other 50 as irrigated with any other less efficient technology the third scenario describes 100 of the cultivated area as using improved tillage drip nozzle irrigation and canal optimization 9 9 this scenario requires the experts to estimate the effects of three projects instead of a single one in contrast the first and second scenarios includes sprinkler irrigation only this was considered necessary by the authors as it resembles the real description of the state and federal governments plant to modernize the irrigation district 01 the fourth scenario describes scenario 3 but applied only to 50 of the cultivated area and the other 50 as irrigated with any other less efficient technology hereafter we label these scenarios as sprinkler 100 sprinkler 50 tillage 100 and tillage 50 respectively notice that by presenting our experts to these efficient irrigation scenarios in practice we are asking the question what would happen if policy makers were able to implement scenario x now that is given that the elicitation was carried our in 2016 and the year of reference is 2020 most factors affecting the effect from the irrigation technology on water extraction can be thought as fixed including precipitation which is not expected to change significantly in aguascalientes by 2020 26 10 10 we provided inecc s scenarios 26 even though updated ipcc climate change scenarios exist for all the world and are publicly available rather than the accuracy of the scenario the objective was to provide experts with a public number from a reliable source in order to keep climate variables constant across the policy alternatives the choice of the climate scenarios was based on their public availability of the numbers at the date of the workshop and the credibility of the source inecc is the federal government agency in charge of evaluating the federal government s climate change strategy the use of an updated scenario would have entailed an explanation of the downscaling technique we should have used to create a scenario at a state scale from the regional data provided by the ipcc 4 5 elicitation questions the format of the elicitation question is key to successfully implement an ee the most favored format request that experts express their opinions in probabilistic terms e g refs 1 16 20 33 47 however experts may not be familiar with the concept of probability even experts that are familiar with the concept of probability may find difficult to communicate their opinions in probability terms 30 this difficulty has been documented in applications collecting information about parameters whose distribution is relatively narrow i e with tails that are not too long for instance martínez cruz et al 35 elicits expert judgments from agronomists who are familiar with the concept of probability they were asked to report distributions of potato yields in the bolivian altiplano under several scenarios resembling climate change conditions however experts found that assigning probabilities to events with small variance was not an easy task in particular the yields of the variety of potato in the region are relatively low and with small variance because the potato variety is very resistant to variations in weather the research team was interested in learning whether yields would collapse under plausible climate change scenarios and therefore still considered worth eliciting distributions of yields thus the research team borrowed an elicitation strategy that is popular in the contingent valuation literature the double bounded dichotomous question in our application all six experts were familiar with the concept of probability but most of them have never been asked to report their opinions in probability terms thus we use the double bounded dichotomous elicitation question suggested by martínez cruz et al 35 this elicitation strategy requests yes no answers it is double bounded because it consists of two sequential questions the first question requests the experts to report whether water extraction will be in 2020 more than an initial threshold w i the follow up question presents the experts to one of two possible thresholds w n or w y the expert is presented to w n when the expert s answer is no to the first question and therefore w n w i the expert is presented to w y when the expert s answer is yes to the first question and therefore w y w i indeed the values w i w n and w y are chosen by the research team in our case we defined these values with the assistance of the legal director of the state water institute who is herself an agronomist following martínez cruz et al 35 we have defined the thresholds w i w n and w y in an implicit manner by setting percentage changes with respect to the expert s opinion about water extraction in 2020 which is reported by the expert in step 2 of the elicitation protocol thus as described in fig 2 experts answer either yes or no to the initial question 1 under this efficient irrigation scenario would you expect at least initial reduction in the annual volume of underground water extracted for agricultural use in 2020 if the answer to question 1 is no then the follow up question decreases the percentage presented to the expert 2a would you expect at least a reduction of if no follow up if the answer to question 1 is yes then the follow up question increases the percentage presented to the expert 2b would you expect a reduction surpassing if yes follow up percentages presented to the experts are fixed across efficient irrigation scenarios and experts the initial percentage is 10 the if no follow up percentage is 5 and the if yes follow up percentage is 20 notice that the expert is requested to use the value reported in step 2 of the expert elicitation procedure as a pivot when answering to questions 1 and 2a or 2b that is the expert judges whether the water extraction will be lower or higher than his her expectations when no efficient irrigation policy is implemented 11 11 the reader familiar with non market valuation may have noticed that this elicitation question combines the double bounded dichotomous choice question of the contingent valuation literature 24 and the pivot design of the stated choice literature 25 the double bounded strategy implicitly gathers the range of water extraction level that an expert considers plausible under a given efficient irrigation scenario for instance if an expert answers the sequence yes no then he she believes that water extraction will be reduced by 10 20 under the specific irrigation scenario in contrast to other elicitation strategies the double bounded strategy does not gather probability distributions instead the researcher infers the distribution by putting together the different intervals reported by the experts martínez cruz et al 35 argue that this elicitation strategy eases the burden on the experts providing a yes no answer is easier than reporting a probability distribution answering yes or no to percentage changes is intuitive to experts that in their professional careers communicate their judgments as percentage changes economists are not foreign to this way of communicating opinions e g an economist may feel more comfortable providing opinions about price elasticities than about unitary changes in prices by taking the burden away from the experts the double bounded strategy transfers some decisions to the team that develops the expert elicitation protocol for instance by defining the percentages presented to the expert in the follow up questions the research team is implicitly setting the length of the tails of the elicited distribution that is the experts opinions do not completely determine the elicited distribution this can be seen as a drawback because it constraints the range of values covered by the elicited distribution which is particularly relevant when the presence of long tails is suspected martínez cruz et al 35 argue that the double bounded strategy is appropriate as long as the interest is on the central values of the distribution and not in the tails 4 6 strategy to summarize experts opinions the opinions from experts are summarized so that we can inform policy makers aggregation can be attained either through mathematical strategies or through a behavioral approach in which experts are requested to reach an agreement regarding the final values 7 in this application experts opinions are summarized via a mathematical approach we are interested in learning the average water extraction that experts expect under each irrigation scenario we cannot directly calculate an arithmetic mean because we do not gather point expectations of the water extraction instead we need to infer the distribution underlying the yes no answers provided by the experts following martínez cruz et al 35 we implement a maximum likelihood ml approach to infer the probability distribution that puts together the different intervals reported by the experts a ml approach assumes a parametric shape for the underlying probability distribution and estimates the parameters of a specific distribution that fits the responses provided by the experts we assume that the probabilities follow an extreme value distribution which allows for relatively longer tails than for instance a normal distribution once the underlying distribution has been inferred via ml we report average water extraction under each irrigation scenario and its corresponding standard errors let w e be the water extraction expected by expert e in 2020 under no policy scenario reported in step 2 of fig 2 let z b be the percentage change presented in the elicitation questions the superscript b i n y denotes percentages presented to the expert in the elicitation questions i refers to the initial percentage presented in question 1 n refers to the percentage presented in question 2a the if no follow up question and y refers to the percentage in question 2b the if yes follow up question then w e b w e z b 100 is the volume of underground water implicit in the percentage changes presented in the elicitation questions while the percentage changes z b are constant across experts the implicit yields w e b vary across experts because each expert has a different baseline w e finally let w e j be the yields that expert e judges feasible under water policy scenario j then the likelihood function of interest is defined as follows 1 l n ℒ e j d j n n l n p r w e j w e n d j y n l n p r w e i w e j w e y d j n y l n p r w e n w e j w e i d j y y l n p r w e j w e y where ℒ denotes the log of the likelihood function d j n n takes value one if the expert has answered no to the initial elicitation question 1 and no to the follow up question 2a and zero otherwise d j y n d j n y and d j y y similarly defined for the sequences yes no no yes and yes yes p r refers to the probability that the event defined in parentheses is consider a feasible event by the expert for instance p r w e i w e j w e y refers to the probability that the extraction yields feasible by the expert e under scenario j falls in the range of values defined by the extraction implicit in the initial question 1 and the if yes follow up question 2b the probabilities p r are modeled as arising from an extreme value distribution which is the underlying distribution of a logit model 5 summary of experts opinions we want to clarify that the opinions from the experts cannot be interpreted as characterizing or modelling the water extraction for agricultural use we summarize via mean and standard errors the opinions of experts about groundwater extraction under specific irrigation scenarios we have designed scenarios aiming to be realistic at the same time that remain simple and manageable thus the opinions of the experts apply within the limits and assumptions of the scenarios that we have presented to them we are interested in learning what is in the opinion of the experts the water extraction that can be expected under each efficient irrigation scenario presented to them i e sprinkler 100 sprinkler 50 tillage 100 and tillage 50 thus the parameter of interest is the average water extraction expressed in annual hm3 under each scenario table 2 presents four estimates of the average groundwater extraction under each irrigation scenario the first two columns of table 2 report estimates obtained via ordinal least squares ols1 and ols2 and are used as reference values to check the robustness of the maximum likelihood estimates ml1 and ml2 presented in the last two columns of table 2 for the purpose of estimating averages via ols the water extraction variable is defined based on the experts answers to the double bounded elicitation question if an expert answered the sequence no no then water extraction equals the expert s expected extraction in 2020 under no irrigation scenario if an expert answered the sequence yes no then water extraction takes the value implicit in question 1 if an expert answered the sequence no yes then water extraction takes the value implicit in question 2a finally if an expert answered the sequence yes yes then water extraction takes the value implicit in question 2b the estimates reported in the last two columns of table 2 ml1 and ml2 are calculated based on the distribution underlying the yes no answers of our experts this distribution is inferred via the ml approach described in section 4 6 estimates ols1 and ml1 are unconditional means of water extraction under each irrigation scenario estimates ols2 and ml2 are strictly speaking conditional means because estimations control for what we have labeled heuristic difference the parameter associated to the heuristic difference captures the difference in water extraction that a subset of experts consistently report across scenarios documentation of the heterogeneity in opinions is advocated by some ee practitioners as necessary to better inform policy makers morgan 38 in general all four set of estimates in table 2 imply a similar ordering of the irrigation scenarios in terms of water extraction according to the ols1 estimates the sprinkler 100 scenario is the one under which the lowest level of extraction is expected by the experts 261 h m 3 followed by tillage 100 with an extraction of 388 h m 3 sprinkler 50 with 431 h m 3 and tillage 50 with 449 h m 3 this ordering remains under the ols2 estimates once the heuristic difference is controlled for under estimates ml1 and ml2 sprinkler 100 remains as the scenario under which the lowest extraction is expected and tillage 50 remains as the scenario under which the highest extraction is expected under the ml1 and ml2 scenarios in contrast to the ols1 and ols2 scenarios sprinkler 50 represents the second best option in terms of water extraction we interpret the result that all four sets of estimates rank sprinkler 100 as the best and tillage 50 as the worst as evidence of robustness of our aggregation strategy thus hereafter we only discuss the ml2 estimates obtained via the ml approach and controling for the heuristic difference the parameter associated with this difference takes value 2 94 this value implies that a subset of experts in our case two consistently report water extraction levels 294 h m 3 higher than the numbers reported by other experts across irrigation scenarios the average water extraction in the ml2 column is smaller than the average water extraction in the ml1 column because the ml2 column report values that have already subtracted the heuristic difference according to the ml2 estimates the sprinkler 100 scenario is the best in terms of water extraction with 361 h m 3 the worst is the tillage 50 scenario with 456 h m 3 the second best option is sprinkler 50 with 418 h m 3 and tillage 100 is ranked third with 440 h m 3 if the confidence intervals are taken into consideration however the point estimates do not differ from each other more importantly they do not differ from the expected water extraction under no irrigation policy these points are illustrated in fig 3 this figure presents the mean water extraction under each scenario and the corresponding 95 corresponding confidence interval the dotted horizontal line in fig 3 depicts the expected water extraction in 2020 under no policy scenario 630 h m 3 the general message from fig 3 is that experts expect that extraction levels under all but sprinkler 100 scenarios do not substantially differ from the extraction expected under the no policy case while the average extraction under the four irrigation scenarios is below the no irrigation scenario the 95 confidence intervals of three scenarios include the no policy value sprinkler 100 is the exception the upper limit of the confidence interval is 589 h m 3 and the expected water extraction under no irrigation policy is 630 h m 3 thus we draw the conclusion that experts expect small or no impacts on water extraction from the specific efficient irrigation interventions proposed in our scenarios 6 discussion at first our main conclusion seems perplexing our experts expect that irrigation technology improvements will not fulfill the expectation of reducing the depletion of the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes also our experts expect that sprinkler irrigation have a relatively stronger effect on water extraction in comparison to a package of actions that include a more technologically efficient irrigation system drip nozzle tillage and canal optimization these results are relevant in terms of real life policy because these scenarios have been designed to resemble the actions proposed by the state governors of the administration 2010 2016 and the administration that began in 2016 while surprising in isolation our conclusions are coherent with the findings in previous studies that have not relied on expert elicitation techniques and have economic and technical explanations with respect to the economic reasons behind the ineffectiveness of irrigation technology improvements to produce water extraction savings a well known result in economics is that users may increase irrigated area after technology adoption 17 another economic explanation is that farmers switch to crops that use water more intensively for instance pfeiffer and lin 44 find new crop patterns and associate them with the ineffectiveness of irrigation improvements to produce water extraction savings on the technical side of the story better technologies may reduce return flows to the aquifer 52 for instance drip nozzle may use water so efficiently that no water is wasted which impedes the return of water to the aquifer this reasoning is consistent with our experts expecting that sprinkler technology have a slightly better impact on water extraction than a set of improvements that include drip nozzle perry and hellegers 42 point out that the final impact of such efficient technologies depends on users characteristics and hydro geological conditions of the specific site the average opinion of our experts suggest that in the valle de aguascalientes case the policy favored by decision makers would not contribute to solve the problem of aquifer depletion as described in section 4 1 our experts were encouraged to discuss the political and other type of obstacles to the successful implementation of the interventions proposed during the elicitation workshop from this discussion we highlight the following factors 1 unwillingness to use new technologies or water management practices our experts agreed that farmers in aguascalientes have aged and younger people is moving away from agricultural activities thus most of the active farmers prefer technologies crops and practices that they have implemented for many years with no major regards to efficiency criteria 2 farmers may combine efficient and inefficient irrigation practices due to lack of incentives to save water one of our experts mentioned that farmers at el llano municipality received drip irrigation technology which they used combined with flood irrigation one month each with close to zero effects on water savings these two factors are illustrative of the convergence of economic and behavioral factors behind the lack of success in promoting efficient irrigation technologies while the second reason is explained by lack of economic incentives electricity prices for the agricultural sector are subsidizes in mexico the first one is a behavioral one elder people tend to reject new technologies and farmers are relatively old in the mexican agricultural sector indeed if policy makers in aguascalientes keep their intentions to promote investments in efficient irrigation then they must be informed about both behavioral and economic hurdles deterring the adoption and correct use of efficient technologies they also will benefit from a warning with respect how far efficient irrigation can go in terms of reducing the water extraction even if adoption hurdles are overcome our experts seem to think that very efficient technologies may not reduce water extraction thus a follow up question is whether other supply side measures might have a substantial impact on water extraction saving as explained in section 4 1 by the end of our expert elicitation workshop experts were asked to discuss alternative interventions that may reduce the pressure on the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes from this discussion we highlight the following interventions 1 rain harvest not as a resource to fulfill the entire demand from the sector but as a complementary water source 2 reduction of leakage in water transportation from dam calles to the irrigation district 01 3 government guidance to select crops which may reduce water extraction while increasing profits for farmers while the effectiveness of these alternatives is a topic of interest it falls outside the scope of this study here we discuss the features that seem to make these alternatives politically feasible to begin with these interventions focus on a better use of available water this feature makes them less politically contentious compared to a redistribution or a reduction of available water also these interventions target both the objective of using less water and the goal of supporting rural areas finally these interventions are easy to communicate both to decision makers and the public in general while these alternative interventions rank high in their political appeal they all seem to have small chances of reducing groundwater extraction although rain harvest was suggested by most experts no expert could substantiate that the contribution would be important in terms of water supply investment in leakage repair was also favored by most experts but the costs of such intervention are not clear even to people working at the state agency in charge of detecting and repairing leakages regarding governmental guidance to crop selection it is not clear how this mechanism would accomplish a more efficient use of water or a substantial reduction in aquifer depletion in general we have obtained evidence that the irrigation interventions that policy makers are seriously considering may not be expected to have substantial impacts on water extraction this evidence indicates the need to seek for alternatives however the alternatives suggested by our experts seem to also have serious drawbacks in terms of reaching the goal of reducing water depletion 7 conclusions currently aquifer depletion ranks high in the policy agenda in countries located in arid and semi arid regions policy makers in these regions tend to favor investment in efficient irrigation infrastructure according to the experts consulted for this study the long time proposed irrigation interventions should not be expected to dramatically reduce the water extraction from the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes even if the entire irrigation district 01 was under sprinkler irrigation experts do not expect a substantial reduction in water extraction qualitative discussion among experts suggest the reasons of the limited impact could be attributed to deficiencies in the adoption of new technologies and inertia the literature also points out to economic decisions such as more intensive use of water or land expansion after the implementation of efficient technologies also our results are consistent with previous studies documenting that efficient irrigation methods such as drop irrigation may not reduce the pressure on the aquifers the very efficient use of water reduces the return to the aquifer a possible route towards aquifer sustainability is to create the conditions under which irrigation infrastructure may have a substantive impact in reducing water extraction this implies that policy makers need to tackle simultaneously behavioral economic and technological challenges arguably more contentious mechanisms as pricing mechanisms or innovative measures e g decoupling subsidies should be included in the policy agenda during the 1990s a trend in the literature pointed out that pricing is an effective mechanism to tackle water scarcity nevertheless the political difficulty to implement a demand side approach has geared policy makers towards supply side alternatives and soft control mechanisms such as awareness campaigns the results in this paper suggest that effective measures should consider a portfolio of alternatives which should not exclude price mechanisms despite its contentious nature 
8714,aquifer overdraft is a key public concern in arid and semiarid regions where agriculture is responsible of most of the water extraction to tackle this problem policy interventions in those regions most frequently focus on investment in irrigation technologies however these investments are usually carried out without consideration of the effects on water extraction estimation of such effects tend to be expensive and time consuming because they vary depending on technology and location specific conditions and their interactions thus there is the demand for methodologies that can provide cheaper estimates even if rough this paper explores whether an expert elicitation can provide insights on the impacts that are reasonable to expect from specific efficient irrigation technologies our case study is the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes mexico where extraction is more than 80 above of the natural recharge we have learned that our experts in agronomy and hydrology do not expect that sprinkler or drip technologies will substantially reduce overdraft these results are policy relevant because both types of technologies are at center of the strategies proposed by the policy makers aiming to solve aquifer overdraft in aguascalientes keywords aquifer overdraft efficient irrigation technologies expert elicitation aguascalientes 1 introduction aquifer overdraft is a concern in arid and semiarid countries particularly in those countries where urban areas keep growing and economic activities such as agriculture exert most of the pressure on groundwater 32 36 for instance gleeson et al 22 document aquifer depletion in the northern regions of america china africa central and southern asia with effects in the availability and quality of water ecosystems and land damages and rising costs for all uses of water standard policy advice from economists is based on water pricing or electricity pricing aware of the lack of political feasibility of price mechanisms economists have proposed other incentive based instruments aside from pricing one alternative is an innovative intervention known as decoupled subsidies which consists in substituting subsidized electricity or water for a direct payment 3 4 19 in spite of their theoretical appeal they tackle economic sustainability and political feasibility concerns decoupled subsidies have also been difficult to implement due to political equilibria 45 46 48 1 1 in mexico a decoupled subsidy was created farmers were offered the choice choice between a conventional electricity subsidy and a cash payment due to complexity and uncertainty regarding the future effects of the decoupled subsidy they were afraid they could lose rights to their water allocation the program failed personal communication with decision makers that negotiated the program farmers lobbies decision makers from agriculture departments and politicians when challenged with sustainability issues tend to favor supply side policies such as irrigation technology investment which at least in theory aims to reduce water extraction per unit of product irrigation investment is presented frequently as a course of action to tackle two goals i reduction of groundwater extraction and ii support to the agricultural sector 31 however there is evidence of a much more complex relation between water extraction irrigation technology and aquifer depletion 39 43 52 efficient irrigation may result in intensive use of water or expansion of cultivated area which conflict with the objective of using less water 41 44 52 in spite of the complex relationship between irrigation efficiency and aquifer depletion there is evidence that at least transitions from very inefficient systems flood to higher efficiency systems center pivot sprinkler or subsurface drip reduce water use 43 many regions in developing countries including central mexico are currently transitioning from very inefficient systems to potentially very efficient ones in this context having an estimate of the effects of projected irrigation investments on groundwater extraction is a key piece of information for planners the problem is that the effects are context dependent and therefore difficult to obtain giordano et al 21 for instance simulates a complex socioeconomic model to obtain an estimation on the other hand field measurement is costly and time consuming as a first step to develop a methodology that aims to help in the design and evaluation of water policy interventions we explore whether data gathered through an expert elicitation are useful to gain insights on the expected impacts of efficient irrigation interventions expert elicitation encompasses an array of strategies to systematically gather process and summarize scientific and technical judgments from a relatively small group of experts who express their opinions in a quantitative manner 8 15 18 38 by obtaining quantitative data as opposed to obtaining only qualitative data expert elicitation is a piece of empirical research that enhances decision making processes thus expert elicitation is regarded as particularly useful when other empirical data is limited unreliable or expensive either in monetary terms or time wise or both 30 in addition the implementation of a rigorous expert elicitation is considered an important dimension of assessment exercises in contexts where uncertainty is large 34 while the precision of the estimates obtained via an expert elicitation might be lower compared to more expensive and time consuming approaches we argue the figures are a sensible guide to policy makers in charge of chosing the interventions to address groundwater withdrawal concerns we do not wish to argue that expert elicitation is a stand alone methodology ideally the rough estimates obtained via expert elicitation can be used in a complementary manner with other methodologies e g modelling strategies that require calibration of parameters we take as case study the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes located in central mexico because it illustrates the problems usually found in arid and semiarid regions of developing countries as other arid cities in mexico and other parts of the world aguascalientes extracts from its aquifer almost double the volume of the natural recharge mainly to fulfill agriculture demand due to political lobbying most of the efforts and money to tackle water issues are channeled through water infrastructure investments mainly irrigation modernization water pipelines sprinkler and drop irrigation decisions are made without a clear estimation of the effects of the policies in section 2 we present challenges specific to the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes and how it illustrates more general concerns in sections 3 and 4 we explain the expert elicitation methodology and the protocol used in this study in section 5 we present the aggregated opinions from our experts regarding the effects of efficient irrigation technologies on aquifer extraction in section 6 we discuss the policy implications of our findings section 7 concludes 2 case study area in this section we make the point that the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes is illustrative for our purposes because i it is under overdraft conditions ii the policy makers in charge of conserving the groundwater in aguascalientes are seriously considering the possibility of implementing policy interventions encouraging the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies and iii despite the popularity of such interventions their effects on groundwater extraction are not clear yet 2 1 irrigation and water extraction in the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes according to the mexican constitution both surface water and groundwater belong to the nation and as such the bulk water used by each municipality is granted by the national water commission conagua each type of user e g agriculture industrial pays a price for its consumption in accordance with the federal law of rights agriculture users pay zero pesos unless they exceed their allowance the state of aguascalientes fulfills its water demand using 29 of surface water and 71 of groundwater as shown in table 1 in aguascalientes a volume of 618 4 cubic hectometers hm3 per year is granted by conagua to all different users from both surface and ground waters the agriculture sector is the highest consumptive user with a water allocation of 481 8 hm3 78 of the total consumptive use the urban and domestic sectors are granted together 122 hm3 20 and the industrial sector is granted 14 6 hm3 2 12 groundwater is withdrawn mostly from the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes 2 2 based on its geography and hydro geological function the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes is part of an inter state aquifer the ojocaliente aguascalientes encarnación aquifer which crosses the states of zacatecas aguascalientes and zacatecas because many substantive decisions are made at the state level official figures are produced based on the intersection of the inter state and the political boundaries being the valle de aguascalientes one of the three resulting aquifers one of the five aquifers that cross the state boundaries fig 1 according to conagua 10 the volume of extraction from the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes is 430 hm3 according to the same official source the average natural recharge is of 235 hm3 making the withdrawal from the aquifer more than 80 above the sustainable level of extraction as of december 20th 2013 when official figures were released the five aquifers of aguascalientes were classified as under deficit or with negative availability the calculations and discussion presented in this paper refer to the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes where more than 95 of the population and economic activity of the state is located aguascalientes shares a challenge with other mexican states in the central and northern areas of the country how to manage an over exploited aquifer to fulfill the water demand from its growing population which grows at a rate of around 2 annually and booming industrial sectors in 2014 official figures estimated a state gdp growth rate of 11 17 by far the highest rate of all the 32 mexican states while keeping the supply to its irrigated agriculture sector as most mexican states where political factors deter decision makers from managing water resources using demand side mechanisms 6 23 29 3 3 even though the city of aguascalientes is one of the cities with higher participation of the private sector participation in domestic water provision the water pricing structure is not very dynamic and the price ranges are similar to other cities agriculture use of water is regulated by the federation currently there is no fee for agriculture use of water and the energy to pump irrigation water is highly subsidized water management delves around water supply investments ranging from irrigation technologies to artificial aquifer injection and plans for inter basin water transfers most of the irrigated agriculture in aguascalientes is developed in the irrigation district 01 located in the municipality pabellón de arteaga north of the municipality of aguascalientes and a few kilometers from the main metropolitan area 4 4 with a population slightly above 1 million 300 thousand inhabitants 27 the central state aguascalientes is one of the less populated states in mexico the twenty seventh out of thirty two entities but the metropolitan area which includes the capital city of aguascalientes 310 miles north from mexico city concentrates around 90 of the state s population ranking as the fourteenth most populated city in the country within an urban system of 384 urban areas classified as cities by the national council of population 14 the irrigation district 01 comprises a total surface of 10 396 hectares has of which 3 992 are irrigated with 33 6 hm3 according to conagua 12 outside of the irrigation district 01 there are around 3 500 has dedicated to agriculture for a total of 7 591 has of cultivated land of which 7 179 has are irrigated the main crops cultivated by about 2 744 users are maize and alfalfa about half of the cultivated area is irrigated with irrigation wells and another half using water from dams mostly from the plutarco elías calles dam technological investment at irrigation district 01 is a salient infrastructure project considered in the current state administration in his inaugural address speech on december 1st 2016 governor martín orozco made five pledges related to specific major infrastructure projects to be implemented during his six year administration three were related to urban mobility one to urban ecosystem restoration and one was to invest in modern irrigation technologies for 100 of the cultivated area in the irrigation district 01 5 5 according to the state government s development plan 2016 2022 a document that sets the guidelines of an administration every six years as mandated by the state constitution at the beginning of the administration the modernization of the irrigation district 01 had a progress of 75 this illustrates the salience of the investment compared to any other policy issue and it highlights the relevance of estimating the effect on aquifer depletion 2 2 political dynamics explaining the salience of irrigation investments in the mexican water policy under no political constraints price mechanisms are advised to deal with scarcity problems a realistic advice however considers that political actors use their resources to get benefits while avoiding most of the costs while supply side alternatives are less politically contentious compared to demand side alternatives with the exception of the highly contentious water transfer projects each alternative has supporters and opponents which tilts the balance to specific alternatives beyond their objective contribution to the scarcity problem still this does not necessarily explain the salience of irrigation infrastructure as a way to tackle water policy issues theoretically in a policy situation where the alternatives are forced to be on the water supply side politicians could calculate the optimal portfolio of water investments assuming it is possible to determine the effect of each measure on water consumption however in aguascalientes case decisions seemingly recur quickly to big infrastructure projects without considering the estimated impact on desirable outcomes either aquifer conservation or agriculture production we argue below that the salience of these kind of investments hinges on the features of the mexican political system firstly planning horizons are determined by the executive branch term six years in the case of state governors without reelection the one term limit induce governors for whom water is a salient issue to devote their resources both financial and political to major infrastructure projects that increase substantially water supply in a single six year term secondly the available alternatives are set by the state government but with high influence from the federal government where the president faces also one term only periods and seeks important projects in a single term in most of the major investments the cost is shared by both levels of government the federation leads the states toward a given direction using matching funds investment conditions this is an important financial incentive to build big infrastructure projects thirdly an evidence based model of policy making requires quality data and intensive analysis capabilities to compete with politics driven decision making in the case of states depending mostly on groundwater the data and the analysts are very scarce specific to our case of study information on the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes is expensive and scattered since 1971 there have been four major studies to measure water availability in the aquifer and some require expensive and sophisticated analyses 10 6 6 the report is official information by conagua the mexican federal government s water agency the second to last study from 1996 included a detailed analysis of the state of all wells in the region the case in other cities is likely to be even more difficult our experts consider that the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes is one the most studied in the country these conditions explain that the water policy efforts are usually focused on a few investment projects both at the state and federal level in mexico often large programs are carried out without evidence of their outcomes the largest hydrological project of the state administration 2010 2016 was the artificial recharge of the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes according to the state government s inagua the cost of the project was 145 million pesos from the federal budget equivalent to roughly 8 million dollars in 2017 plus 60 million pesos more than 3 million dollars from the state government s budget and a yearly operation cost of 20 million pesos more than 1 million dollars according to conagua 53 aquifer injection in aguascalientes could provide 0 43 hm3 from 2012 in 2018 in contrast sprinkler irrigation could save 7 81 hm3 through decreasing aquifer extraction 53 however no evidence about the actual effect from the artificial recharge has been provided during our workshop the participants unanimously concluded that the artificial recharge had not accomplished the goal of providing water in a sustainable manner and they pointed out that academics from the state university universidad autónoma de aguascalientes uaa were concerned about the usefulness and technical viability of the investment a crucial input to water decision making focused on reducing aquifer depletion is to identify the contribution of major projects to the reduction of water consumption and extraction if a major water project is about to absorb most financial resources a necessary step is to estimate the effects from each alternative under consideration in the political agenda the distribution of effort and money to fulfill water demand under the conditions described above has been a perennial concern in aguascalientes and other mexican states we contribute with a method to estimate the contribution of a policy alternative to a specific goal i e the reduction of aquifer depletion under time budget and information constraints 3 methodology in this section we motivate the implementation of an expert elicitation protocol to inform policy makers in aguascalientes then we briefly describe the steps to design an expert elicitation protocol in doing so we provide instances referring to our application but it is in section 4 that we present a detailed description of the expert elicitation protocol developed for this study 3 1 why do we use expert elicitation in section 2 we have described a context in which policy makers in charge of groundwater are considering the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies however they have not been informed with estimates of the potential effects of such technologies on groundwater extraction in this context the calculation preferably in no time and at a low cost of such estimates is essential to inform the decision making process here is where expert elicitation ee comes into play ee encompasses an array of strategies to systematically gather process and summarize scientific and technical judgments from a relatively small group of experts 8 15 18 38 economists regularly use expert judgment as complementary information in issues such as gdp growth inflation and unemployment ee collects data that can be analyzed quantitatively e g data for which a mean and standard deviation can be calculated in order to extract as quantitative information as possible a precise question must be in place e g what rate of unemployment can we expect next year is preferred over will the unemployment rate be worse next year 7 7 experts can also be requested to respond in qualitative terms to questions that are quantitative in nature for instance do you think that unemployment will increase next year to this question an expert can answer yes or no although the percentage of experts thinking that there will be more unemployment can be calculated the information obtained in this way is not enough to learn how bad unemployment will be next year ee aims to extract quantitative data that answers in this context the specific question of what rate of unemployment can we expect for next year the key difference of ee with respect to other methods of consulting with experts e g semi structured interviews is that ee requests experts to answer in numerical terms by obtaining quantitative data as opposed to obtaining only qualitative data ee is a piece of empirical research that enhances decision making processes this is why ee is particularly useful when other empirical data is limited unreliable or expensive either in monetary terms or time wise or both 30 the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes is a good example of the need of timely analysis to inform policy makers this aquifer has been studied by several long term studies and pilot studies of all sorts due to the presence of national research centers such as the headquarters of inegi the internationally renowned mexican institute for geography and statistics and a chapter of inifap the national institute for forestry agriculture and livestock research which produces relevant valuable scientific research and data as well as high quality education institutions such as the state university uaa notwithstanding the number of studies on the aquifer a diagnostic by a research group from the uaa has documented that given the lack or the deficiency of the piezometric data and other relevant information it is not possible to characterize the functioning and the status of the aquifer and more technical studies have been recommended 50 in a more recent research effort inegi aimed to model behavior of the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes using system dynamics techniques which allow analysts to feed the model with real data and test different policy interventions 28 a team from inegi s department of geography and environment has been working on the model for more than four years the advantage of the ee approach is that an approximation can be produced in a short time and it is able to provide inputs for other approaches such as inegi s model where some parameters are fed into the model from strong assumptions that might be more meaningful if substituted with estimates obtained via an ee 3 2 expert elicitation design a brief description bosetti et al 8 break the design of an ee protocol down into eight steps these steps are carried out in an iterative manner and thus practitioners may return to a specific step several times in the first step the research team defines the elicitation s goal and the mode of elicitation the goal of an elicitation must be unambiguous in terms of the metric that experts are requested to use when reporting the parameter of interest for instance one goal of our elicitation is to learn expert s best conjecture about the current level of annual groundwater extraction and experts have been requested to express their expectations in h m 3 the elicitation mode refers to the mechanism chosen to administer the ee protocol elicitation modes range from face to face interviews to protocols that can be self administered via a web based platform the selection of the specific mode is not without trade offs see refs 5 51 for details on this in this application we have chosen to gather all our experts together in a single session and present them to the elicitation protocol simultaneously via a seminar format we elaborate on this decision in section 4 1 in the second step of an ee design the research team identifies an initial set of individuals with experience in the area s of knowledge under which the research question falls details on the expertise required for this application are provided in section 4 2 these experts are contacted to explore their availability and willingness to participate in the ee at this stage it is important that the elicitation s goal is clear and precise enough to be explained to the experts who may decline their participation if the goal is not clear or relevant this initial set of experts may latter be trimmed due to i a more precise definition of the required knowledge and or ii the unavailability or unwillingness of a number of experts to participate in the ee in the third step the research team decides the format of the elicitation question the format determines the measure that experts report during the elicitation for instance experts may report the mean or median of the parameter of interest e g ref 49 or percentiles characterizing the distribution of the parameter under analysis e g refs 33 47 also experts may be presented to questions that can only receive answers that are dichotomous in nature e g when presented to alternatives designed according to a discrete choice experiment 2 or when presented to questions that can only receive yes no answers 35 in this study we implement the double dichotomous format suggested by ref 35 we elaborate on this decision in section 4 5 in the fourth step experts receive background material and are trained in the rationale behind the elicitation question this step may be carried out in advance to the implementation of the protocol or as a preliminary step during the elicitation session we chose the second option and elaborate on this decision in section 4 1 in the fifth step the ee protocol is tuned by piloting parts or the entire protocol in this step it is important to make sure that the metric of interest is clear to the experts and that hypothetical scenarios are understood by experts we piloted parts of our protocol mainly focusing on the different versions of the expert elicitation questions the sixth step consist in the gathering of opinions from the experts via the elicitation protocol as detailed in section 4 3 the statistical analysis of the gathered data is the seventh step details are provided in section 4 6 the final step consists in reporting the summary of the experts opinions which we do in section 5 next section provides the specifics of the ee protocol developed in the context of this study 4 expert elicitation protocol 4 1 goal number of experts elicitation mode and implementation the goal of our ee protocol is twofold we first aim to gather and summarize the opinion of experts about the volume of underground water that will be extracted in 2020 for agricultural use from the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes the second goal is to collect the opinion of experts on whether the extraction of underground water can be reduced through specific policy scenarios aiming to increase the irrigation efficiency in the agricultural sector we set 2020 as year of reference because 2020 has frequently been used in prospective studies in mexico also we are interested in delivering results that can be used as soon as possible to inform public policies given that the planing horizons in mexico are determined by the executive branch then we set our year of interest to the year where the state administration which began in 2016 is expected to make their case on the delivery of their policies six experts responded to our protocol this number of respondents may appear small to readers who are not familiar with the ee literature actually six is a reasonable number of experts clemen and winkler 9 argue that the marginal value of an additional expert decreases substantially after three to four experts to put our number of experts in context consider the 28 ee studies reviewed by bosetti et al 8 among these studies the minimum number of experts is three and the maximum is 55 and 50 of these studies consulted 8 experts or less indeed a reader acquainted with empirical quantitative methodologies may wonder whether there are enough degrees of freedom in these data to carry out conditional analysis as pointed out by bosetti et al 8 the concept of statistical significance supported by efficient standard errors is not the most appropriate in this context the first reason is that the opinions from experts are correlated to some extent because they share a common set of background information the second reason is that we aim to collect and summarize the opinions of the experts goal that can be accomplished by calculating mean and standard deviation of the experts opinions we do not aim for instance to infer the determinants of underground water extraction all six experts attended a 6 h workshop held on march 19th 2016 at the centro de investigacion y docencia economicas cide campus region centro located in aguascalientes city during the first hour of the workshop experts were informed of the structure of the questions the elicitation s goal and received information about the conditions of the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes we were careful not to provide cues on what were the expected effects of particular policies on the outcome of interest to avoid biased responses the information on the aquifer levels of extraction were presented to test whether all agreed on the deficit between natural recharge and extraction and to highlight that the variable of interest was water extraction at this stage experts were encouraged to discuss about the background information provided by the facilitators thus experts pointed out information and sources not mentioned by the facilitator and expressed agreement or disagreement with specific pieces of the information some questioned the accuracy of the exact levels of extraction from official sources due to measurement concerns but agreed that a precise figure was not known still the experts agreed that the extraction was higher than natural recharge and that reducing the deficit was a valuable policy goal in addition experts were encouraged to discuss about the policy interventions that in their opinion would decrease the extraction of underground water in the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes during the second and third hour of the workshop the experts responded the elicitation questions these questions were presented on a screen visible to all six experts answered via a web based platform in an independent way i e experts were not allowed to exchange points of view at this stage experts were introduced to the structure of the elicitation questions through questions that elicited opinions about an unrelated topic e g migration policies during the last two hours of the workshop the experts were encouraged to i provide comments on the ee protocol ii identify policies that may be worth discussing in a future workshop and iii identify the political and other type of obstacles to the successful implementation of the interventions under discussion 4 2 the expertise of our experts for purposes of this study an expert is an individual whose professional career is closely related to water management and the agricultural sector in aguascalientes with a particular interest on irrigation district 01 see section 2 more specifically experts in this study have accumulated knowledge about the factors impacting extraction of underground water for agricultural use in aguascalientes and how specific technologies and cropping practices perform in aguascalientes the way experts are selected determines the opinions that are collected for instance if experts are all academic researchers the type of gathered knowledge may miss the specific knowledge acquired by field technicians in fact meyer and booker 37 recommends the selection of a diverse pool of experts to avoid as much as possible the cognitive heuristic known as anchoring i e the documented tendency of people to not adjust sufficiently from an initial reference value 38 thus keeping in mind our expertise requirements and aiming to cover a wide enough range of opinions we first put together a list of 15 individuals in doing so we were assisted by the legal director of the state water institute the 15 experts were contacted via e mail and invited to participate in a workshop in which they would be requested to respond to an elicitation protocol the goal of the protocol was explained to them and initial background information was provided twelve experts attended the workshop six of these experts have knowledge on water extraction for residential and industrial purposes this paper reports opinions of the six experts with knowledge on water extraction for agricultural use two of our experts work at the state water institute inagua two experts are private consultants one is academic researcher and on is a farmer the two consultants are agronomists the academic researcher who provided valuable qualitative insights holds a phd on earth science and specializes in geo hydrology the two experts working at the governmental agency are civil engineers 4 3 expert elicitation procedure experts judgments are elicited via a four step procedure which is schematically summarized in fig 2 in the first step experts receive background information this information includes the explanation of the elicitation s goal and the description of the 2020 scenario in the second step experts report the volume of underground water that in their opinion will be extracted for agricultural use in 2020 8 8 we have chosen 2020 as year of reference because i it is the year commonly used for short term prospective studies in mexico and ii the administration should be able to make a case on the delivery of their policies about four years after the state government inauguration in this case 2016 experts are told to assume 2020 conditions as described in step 1 in the third step the facilitator describes one of the four policy scenarios under study in step 4 experts report their expectations about the reduction in water extraction attainable under the policy scenario presented in step 3 the next two sections describe in detail the 2020 scenario the four policy scenarios and our elicitation question 4 4 efficient irrigation scenarios experts cannot provide unconditional judgments they need to be informed about the conditions under which they are requested to forecast groundwater extraction thus we first provide a 2020 scenario described in terms of population in aguascalientes and average annual temperature population is set at 1 4 million people which is the expected population in 2020 according to the national council of population the population in 2016 was 1 31 million people 13 the average annual temperature was described as increasing by 1 6 c which is the upper bound of the temperature expected in aguascalientes according to the national institute of ecology and climate change 26 the efficient irrigation scenarios aim to capture the most salient alternatives discussed in the political arena in aguascalientes thus we design four scenarios closely resembling those proposed by the national water agency in a report that identified the gaps between water supply and water demand 11 the first scenario describes 100 of the cultivated area in the irrigation district 01 as irrigated using sprinklers the second scenario describes 50 of the cultivated area in the irrigation district 01 as irrigated using sprinklers and the other 50 as irrigated with any other less efficient technology the third scenario describes 100 of the cultivated area as using improved tillage drip nozzle irrigation and canal optimization 9 9 this scenario requires the experts to estimate the effects of three projects instead of a single one in contrast the first and second scenarios includes sprinkler irrigation only this was considered necessary by the authors as it resembles the real description of the state and federal governments plant to modernize the irrigation district 01 the fourth scenario describes scenario 3 but applied only to 50 of the cultivated area and the other 50 as irrigated with any other less efficient technology hereafter we label these scenarios as sprinkler 100 sprinkler 50 tillage 100 and tillage 50 respectively notice that by presenting our experts to these efficient irrigation scenarios in practice we are asking the question what would happen if policy makers were able to implement scenario x now that is given that the elicitation was carried our in 2016 and the year of reference is 2020 most factors affecting the effect from the irrigation technology on water extraction can be thought as fixed including precipitation which is not expected to change significantly in aguascalientes by 2020 26 10 10 we provided inecc s scenarios 26 even though updated ipcc climate change scenarios exist for all the world and are publicly available rather than the accuracy of the scenario the objective was to provide experts with a public number from a reliable source in order to keep climate variables constant across the policy alternatives the choice of the climate scenarios was based on their public availability of the numbers at the date of the workshop and the credibility of the source inecc is the federal government agency in charge of evaluating the federal government s climate change strategy the use of an updated scenario would have entailed an explanation of the downscaling technique we should have used to create a scenario at a state scale from the regional data provided by the ipcc 4 5 elicitation questions the format of the elicitation question is key to successfully implement an ee the most favored format request that experts express their opinions in probabilistic terms e g refs 1 16 20 33 47 however experts may not be familiar with the concept of probability even experts that are familiar with the concept of probability may find difficult to communicate their opinions in probability terms 30 this difficulty has been documented in applications collecting information about parameters whose distribution is relatively narrow i e with tails that are not too long for instance martínez cruz et al 35 elicits expert judgments from agronomists who are familiar with the concept of probability they were asked to report distributions of potato yields in the bolivian altiplano under several scenarios resembling climate change conditions however experts found that assigning probabilities to events with small variance was not an easy task in particular the yields of the variety of potato in the region are relatively low and with small variance because the potato variety is very resistant to variations in weather the research team was interested in learning whether yields would collapse under plausible climate change scenarios and therefore still considered worth eliciting distributions of yields thus the research team borrowed an elicitation strategy that is popular in the contingent valuation literature the double bounded dichotomous question in our application all six experts were familiar with the concept of probability but most of them have never been asked to report their opinions in probability terms thus we use the double bounded dichotomous elicitation question suggested by martínez cruz et al 35 this elicitation strategy requests yes no answers it is double bounded because it consists of two sequential questions the first question requests the experts to report whether water extraction will be in 2020 more than an initial threshold w i the follow up question presents the experts to one of two possible thresholds w n or w y the expert is presented to w n when the expert s answer is no to the first question and therefore w n w i the expert is presented to w y when the expert s answer is yes to the first question and therefore w y w i indeed the values w i w n and w y are chosen by the research team in our case we defined these values with the assistance of the legal director of the state water institute who is herself an agronomist following martínez cruz et al 35 we have defined the thresholds w i w n and w y in an implicit manner by setting percentage changes with respect to the expert s opinion about water extraction in 2020 which is reported by the expert in step 2 of the elicitation protocol thus as described in fig 2 experts answer either yes or no to the initial question 1 under this efficient irrigation scenario would you expect at least initial reduction in the annual volume of underground water extracted for agricultural use in 2020 if the answer to question 1 is no then the follow up question decreases the percentage presented to the expert 2a would you expect at least a reduction of if no follow up if the answer to question 1 is yes then the follow up question increases the percentage presented to the expert 2b would you expect a reduction surpassing if yes follow up percentages presented to the experts are fixed across efficient irrigation scenarios and experts the initial percentage is 10 the if no follow up percentage is 5 and the if yes follow up percentage is 20 notice that the expert is requested to use the value reported in step 2 of the expert elicitation procedure as a pivot when answering to questions 1 and 2a or 2b that is the expert judges whether the water extraction will be lower or higher than his her expectations when no efficient irrigation policy is implemented 11 11 the reader familiar with non market valuation may have noticed that this elicitation question combines the double bounded dichotomous choice question of the contingent valuation literature 24 and the pivot design of the stated choice literature 25 the double bounded strategy implicitly gathers the range of water extraction level that an expert considers plausible under a given efficient irrigation scenario for instance if an expert answers the sequence yes no then he she believes that water extraction will be reduced by 10 20 under the specific irrigation scenario in contrast to other elicitation strategies the double bounded strategy does not gather probability distributions instead the researcher infers the distribution by putting together the different intervals reported by the experts martínez cruz et al 35 argue that this elicitation strategy eases the burden on the experts providing a yes no answer is easier than reporting a probability distribution answering yes or no to percentage changes is intuitive to experts that in their professional careers communicate their judgments as percentage changes economists are not foreign to this way of communicating opinions e g an economist may feel more comfortable providing opinions about price elasticities than about unitary changes in prices by taking the burden away from the experts the double bounded strategy transfers some decisions to the team that develops the expert elicitation protocol for instance by defining the percentages presented to the expert in the follow up questions the research team is implicitly setting the length of the tails of the elicited distribution that is the experts opinions do not completely determine the elicited distribution this can be seen as a drawback because it constraints the range of values covered by the elicited distribution which is particularly relevant when the presence of long tails is suspected martínez cruz et al 35 argue that the double bounded strategy is appropriate as long as the interest is on the central values of the distribution and not in the tails 4 6 strategy to summarize experts opinions the opinions from experts are summarized so that we can inform policy makers aggregation can be attained either through mathematical strategies or through a behavioral approach in which experts are requested to reach an agreement regarding the final values 7 in this application experts opinions are summarized via a mathematical approach we are interested in learning the average water extraction that experts expect under each irrigation scenario we cannot directly calculate an arithmetic mean because we do not gather point expectations of the water extraction instead we need to infer the distribution underlying the yes no answers provided by the experts following martínez cruz et al 35 we implement a maximum likelihood ml approach to infer the probability distribution that puts together the different intervals reported by the experts a ml approach assumes a parametric shape for the underlying probability distribution and estimates the parameters of a specific distribution that fits the responses provided by the experts we assume that the probabilities follow an extreme value distribution which allows for relatively longer tails than for instance a normal distribution once the underlying distribution has been inferred via ml we report average water extraction under each irrigation scenario and its corresponding standard errors let w e be the water extraction expected by expert e in 2020 under no policy scenario reported in step 2 of fig 2 let z b be the percentage change presented in the elicitation questions the superscript b i n y denotes percentages presented to the expert in the elicitation questions i refers to the initial percentage presented in question 1 n refers to the percentage presented in question 2a the if no follow up question and y refers to the percentage in question 2b the if yes follow up question then w e b w e z b 100 is the volume of underground water implicit in the percentage changes presented in the elicitation questions while the percentage changes z b are constant across experts the implicit yields w e b vary across experts because each expert has a different baseline w e finally let w e j be the yields that expert e judges feasible under water policy scenario j then the likelihood function of interest is defined as follows 1 l n ℒ e j d j n n l n p r w e j w e n d j y n l n p r w e i w e j w e y d j n y l n p r w e n w e j w e i d j y y l n p r w e j w e y where ℒ denotes the log of the likelihood function d j n n takes value one if the expert has answered no to the initial elicitation question 1 and no to the follow up question 2a and zero otherwise d j y n d j n y and d j y y similarly defined for the sequences yes no no yes and yes yes p r refers to the probability that the event defined in parentheses is consider a feasible event by the expert for instance p r w e i w e j w e y refers to the probability that the extraction yields feasible by the expert e under scenario j falls in the range of values defined by the extraction implicit in the initial question 1 and the if yes follow up question 2b the probabilities p r are modeled as arising from an extreme value distribution which is the underlying distribution of a logit model 5 summary of experts opinions we want to clarify that the opinions from the experts cannot be interpreted as characterizing or modelling the water extraction for agricultural use we summarize via mean and standard errors the opinions of experts about groundwater extraction under specific irrigation scenarios we have designed scenarios aiming to be realistic at the same time that remain simple and manageable thus the opinions of the experts apply within the limits and assumptions of the scenarios that we have presented to them we are interested in learning what is in the opinion of the experts the water extraction that can be expected under each efficient irrigation scenario presented to them i e sprinkler 100 sprinkler 50 tillage 100 and tillage 50 thus the parameter of interest is the average water extraction expressed in annual hm3 under each scenario table 2 presents four estimates of the average groundwater extraction under each irrigation scenario the first two columns of table 2 report estimates obtained via ordinal least squares ols1 and ols2 and are used as reference values to check the robustness of the maximum likelihood estimates ml1 and ml2 presented in the last two columns of table 2 for the purpose of estimating averages via ols the water extraction variable is defined based on the experts answers to the double bounded elicitation question if an expert answered the sequence no no then water extraction equals the expert s expected extraction in 2020 under no irrigation scenario if an expert answered the sequence yes no then water extraction takes the value implicit in question 1 if an expert answered the sequence no yes then water extraction takes the value implicit in question 2a finally if an expert answered the sequence yes yes then water extraction takes the value implicit in question 2b the estimates reported in the last two columns of table 2 ml1 and ml2 are calculated based on the distribution underlying the yes no answers of our experts this distribution is inferred via the ml approach described in section 4 6 estimates ols1 and ml1 are unconditional means of water extraction under each irrigation scenario estimates ols2 and ml2 are strictly speaking conditional means because estimations control for what we have labeled heuristic difference the parameter associated to the heuristic difference captures the difference in water extraction that a subset of experts consistently report across scenarios documentation of the heterogeneity in opinions is advocated by some ee practitioners as necessary to better inform policy makers morgan 38 in general all four set of estimates in table 2 imply a similar ordering of the irrigation scenarios in terms of water extraction according to the ols1 estimates the sprinkler 100 scenario is the one under which the lowest level of extraction is expected by the experts 261 h m 3 followed by tillage 100 with an extraction of 388 h m 3 sprinkler 50 with 431 h m 3 and tillage 50 with 449 h m 3 this ordering remains under the ols2 estimates once the heuristic difference is controlled for under estimates ml1 and ml2 sprinkler 100 remains as the scenario under which the lowest extraction is expected and tillage 50 remains as the scenario under which the highest extraction is expected under the ml1 and ml2 scenarios in contrast to the ols1 and ols2 scenarios sprinkler 50 represents the second best option in terms of water extraction we interpret the result that all four sets of estimates rank sprinkler 100 as the best and tillage 50 as the worst as evidence of robustness of our aggregation strategy thus hereafter we only discuss the ml2 estimates obtained via the ml approach and controling for the heuristic difference the parameter associated with this difference takes value 2 94 this value implies that a subset of experts in our case two consistently report water extraction levels 294 h m 3 higher than the numbers reported by other experts across irrigation scenarios the average water extraction in the ml2 column is smaller than the average water extraction in the ml1 column because the ml2 column report values that have already subtracted the heuristic difference according to the ml2 estimates the sprinkler 100 scenario is the best in terms of water extraction with 361 h m 3 the worst is the tillage 50 scenario with 456 h m 3 the second best option is sprinkler 50 with 418 h m 3 and tillage 100 is ranked third with 440 h m 3 if the confidence intervals are taken into consideration however the point estimates do not differ from each other more importantly they do not differ from the expected water extraction under no irrigation policy these points are illustrated in fig 3 this figure presents the mean water extraction under each scenario and the corresponding 95 corresponding confidence interval the dotted horizontal line in fig 3 depicts the expected water extraction in 2020 under no policy scenario 630 h m 3 the general message from fig 3 is that experts expect that extraction levels under all but sprinkler 100 scenarios do not substantially differ from the extraction expected under the no policy case while the average extraction under the four irrigation scenarios is below the no irrigation scenario the 95 confidence intervals of three scenarios include the no policy value sprinkler 100 is the exception the upper limit of the confidence interval is 589 h m 3 and the expected water extraction under no irrigation policy is 630 h m 3 thus we draw the conclusion that experts expect small or no impacts on water extraction from the specific efficient irrigation interventions proposed in our scenarios 6 discussion at first our main conclusion seems perplexing our experts expect that irrigation technology improvements will not fulfill the expectation of reducing the depletion of the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes also our experts expect that sprinkler irrigation have a relatively stronger effect on water extraction in comparison to a package of actions that include a more technologically efficient irrigation system drip nozzle tillage and canal optimization these results are relevant in terms of real life policy because these scenarios have been designed to resemble the actions proposed by the state governors of the administration 2010 2016 and the administration that began in 2016 while surprising in isolation our conclusions are coherent with the findings in previous studies that have not relied on expert elicitation techniques and have economic and technical explanations with respect to the economic reasons behind the ineffectiveness of irrigation technology improvements to produce water extraction savings a well known result in economics is that users may increase irrigated area after technology adoption 17 another economic explanation is that farmers switch to crops that use water more intensively for instance pfeiffer and lin 44 find new crop patterns and associate them with the ineffectiveness of irrigation improvements to produce water extraction savings on the technical side of the story better technologies may reduce return flows to the aquifer 52 for instance drip nozzle may use water so efficiently that no water is wasted which impedes the return of water to the aquifer this reasoning is consistent with our experts expecting that sprinkler technology have a slightly better impact on water extraction than a set of improvements that include drip nozzle perry and hellegers 42 point out that the final impact of such efficient technologies depends on users characteristics and hydro geological conditions of the specific site the average opinion of our experts suggest that in the valle de aguascalientes case the policy favored by decision makers would not contribute to solve the problem of aquifer depletion as described in section 4 1 our experts were encouraged to discuss the political and other type of obstacles to the successful implementation of the interventions proposed during the elicitation workshop from this discussion we highlight the following factors 1 unwillingness to use new technologies or water management practices our experts agreed that farmers in aguascalientes have aged and younger people is moving away from agricultural activities thus most of the active farmers prefer technologies crops and practices that they have implemented for many years with no major regards to efficiency criteria 2 farmers may combine efficient and inefficient irrigation practices due to lack of incentives to save water one of our experts mentioned that farmers at el llano municipality received drip irrigation technology which they used combined with flood irrigation one month each with close to zero effects on water savings these two factors are illustrative of the convergence of economic and behavioral factors behind the lack of success in promoting efficient irrigation technologies while the second reason is explained by lack of economic incentives electricity prices for the agricultural sector are subsidizes in mexico the first one is a behavioral one elder people tend to reject new technologies and farmers are relatively old in the mexican agricultural sector indeed if policy makers in aguascalientes keep their intentions to promote investments in efficient irrigation then they must be informed about both behavioral and economic hurdles deterring the adoption and correct use of efficient technologies they also will benefit from a warning with respect how far efficient irrigation can go in terms of reducing the water extraction even if adoption hurdles are overcome our experts seem to think that very efficient technologies may not reduce water extraction thus a follow up question is whether other supply side measures might have a substantial impact on water extraction saving as explained in section 4 1 by the end of our expert elicitation workshop experts were asked to discuss alternative interventions that may reduce the pressure on the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes from this discussion we highlight the following interventions 1 rain harvest not as a resource to fulfill the entire demand from the sector but as a complementary water source 2 reduction of leakage in water transportation from dam calles to the irrigation district 01 3 government guidance to select crops which may reduce water extraction while increasing profits for farmers while the effectiveness of these alternatives is a topic of interest it falls outside the scope of this study here we discuss the features that seem to make these alternatives politically feasible to begin with these interventions focus on a better use of available water this feature makes them less politically contentious compared to a redistribution or a reduction of available water also these interventions target both the objective of using less water and the goal of supporting rural areas finally these interventions are easy to communicate both to decision makers and the public in general while these alternative interventions rank high in their political appeal they all seem to have small chances of reducing groundwater extraction although rain harvest was suggested by most experts no expert could substantiate that the contribution would be important in terms of water supply investment in leakage repair was also favored by most experts but the costs of such intervention are not clear even to people working at the state agency in charge of detecting and repairing leakages regarding governmental guidance to crop selection it is not clear how this mechanism would accomplish a more efficient use of water or a substantial reduction in aquifer depletion in general we have obtained evidence that the irrigation interventions that policy makers are seriously considering may not be expected to have substantial impacts on water extraction this evidence indicates the need to seek for alternatives however the alternatives suggested by our experts seem to also have serious drawbacks in terms of reaching the goal of reducing water depletion 7 conclusions currently aquifer depletion ranks high in the policy agenda in countries located in arid and semi arid regions policy makers in these regions tend to favor investment in efficient irrigation infrastructure according to the experts consulted for this study the long time proposed irrigation interventions should not be expected to dramatically reduce the water extraction from the aquifer of valle de aguascalientes even if the entire irrigation district 01 was under sprinkler irrigation experts do not expect a substantial reduction in water extraction qualitative discussion among experts suggest the reasons of the limited impact could be attributed to deficiencies in the adoption of new technologies and inertia the literature also points out to economic decisions such as more intensive use of water or land expansion after the implementation of efficient technologies also our results are consistent with previous studies documenting that efficient irrigation methods such as drop irrigation may not reduce the pressure on the aquifers the very efficient use of water reduces the return to the aquifer a possible route towards aquifer sustainability is to create the conditions under which irrigation infrastructure may have a substantive impact in reducing water extraction this implies that policy makers need to tackle simultaneously behavioral economic and technological challenges arguably more contentious mechanisms as pricing mechanisms or innovative measures e g decoupling subsidies should be included in the policy agenda during the 1990s a trend in the literature pointed out that pricing is an effective mechanism to tackle water scarcity nevertheless the political difficulty to implement a demand side approach has geared policy makers towards supply side alternatives and soft control mechanisms such as awareness campaigns the results in this paper suggest that effective measures should consider a portfolio of alternatives which should not exclude price mechanisms despite its contentious nature
