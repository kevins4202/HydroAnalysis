structural design stage stiffened plates have become a common structural form owing to their advantages of light weight and high stiffness ozdemir et al 2018 ao et al 2020 for the manufacturing of stiffened plates the double sided fiber laser beam welding technology reduces the weight and improving the production efficiency han et al 2017a laser welded al alloys stiffened plates are integrated products of the above three concepts however the ultimate strength of stiffened plate is weakened due to welding process although laser welding has the advantages of narrow weld beads deep penetration and high precision casalino and mortello 2016 moraitis and labeas 2009 as a fusion welding process it inevitably produces welding deformation and residual stresses in welded structures due to the high concentration of heat and the rapid heating and cooling at present thermal elastic plastic tep analysis based on finite element method is commonly used to predict welding deformation and residual stresses in welded structures by considering the influence of welding conditions welding methods constraints and welding sequence on both the temperature and mechanical fields of welded structures li et al 2017 studied the effect of welding conditions on weld shapes and welding deformation using the tep method the results show that the focus current significantly changes the weld shape resulting in various transverse shrinkage distributions and consequently determining transverse bending deformation colegrove et al 2009 compared the effects of various welding methods on welding deformation and residual stresses based on tep analysis a lot of research has been carried out on the influence of welding sequences on welding deformation and residual stresses and a better welding sequence has been given gannon et al 2010 chen et al 2015 fu et al 2016 bai et al 2018a 2018b schenk et al 2010 and zhang and wang 2019 studied the influence of constraint conditions on the welding deformation and residual stresses of stiffened plates the research results demonstrate that the constraint conditions have a significant influence on welding deformation but little influence on residual stresses welding deformation and residual stresses have adverse consequences on the stiffness and ultimate strength of welded structures honaryar et al 2020 soares 1988 ozguc et al 2007 proposed new simple design equations to predict the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened plates taking into account the initial imperfections of geometric deflections and residual stresses tatsumi and fujikubo 2020 used the nonlinear finite element method to analyze the collapse behavior and ultimate strength of a container ship under the combined action of hogging moment and bottom local loads xu and soares 2012a and 2012b simulated the ultimate strength of stiffened plates under uniaxial compression the influence of initial geometric imperfections was considered in the model and the results were compared with the experimental results they found that the initial geometric imperfections have a significant effect on the failure behavior of stiffened plates gannon et al 2012 employed the finite element method to simulate the residual stress field and deformation field caused by the welding process of stiffened plates and then considered these defects in the ultimate strength analysis the results showed that the residual stresses reduce the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate by 11 with a consequent reduction in the hull girder ultimate moment of 3 3 paulo et al 2014 measured the longitudinal residual stresses of friction stir welded specimens using the contour method and then introduced it as initial conditions into the numerical model to investigate the influence of longitudinal residual stresses on the overall compressive performance of welded plates the research showed that the existence of a residual stress field reduces the collapse load compared with a stress free model tekgoz et al 2015 analyzed the influence of residual stresses on the ultimate strength of rectangular stiffened plates by changing the heat input plate thickness and welding sequence it was found that the welding sequence has the most significant influence on the ultimate strength and that a reasonable welding sequence is beneficial for improving the ultimate strength of stiffened plates estefen et al 2016 studied the influence of the initial geometric imperfection mode on the buckling behavior and ultimate strength of stiffened plates by establishing a numerical model of a stiffened plate that can consider geometry nonlinearity and material nonlinearity the results showed that the collapse of the bottom plates is accelerated by geometry imperfections and the ultimate strength of the ship is reduced although stiffened plates are often used to resist longitudinal loads the ultimate strength of stiffened plates under transverse tensile loading sometimes also needs to be considered for example the small waterplane area twin hull swath are exposed to horizontal extreme wave loads the transverse ultimate strength is critical due to large stress concentrations in the narrow struts and haunches as shown in fig 1 moreover welded stiffened plates are more prone to failure under tension load owing to the superimposition of tensile stresses and the high residual tensile stresses near the welded joints in addition the ultimate strength of stiffened plates decreases gradually in the collapse stage under compression load while the fracture failure under tension load is sudden without any precursor and thus the load capacity is completely lost this phenomenon makes the tension load more likely to cause disastrous consequences than the compression load unfortunately research on the ultimate strength of welded structures under tension load is insufficient liu et al 2018 fujikubo et al 2005a 2005b heggelund et al 2000 in this study the ultimate tensile strength of a laser welded al li alloy stiffened plate was studied based on the experiment and numerical analysis first the ultimate strength failure mode and strain evolution were measured by tension experiment combined with digital image correlation dic and electrical measurement and the failure mechanism was also analyzed then the temperature field welding deformation and residual stresses of the stiffened plate were predicted based on the tep model and the model was validated by the measured weld morphology finally the effects of welding deformation and residual stresses on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate were studied by introducing welding deformation and residual stresses into the ultimate strength model considering material nonlinearity geometry nonlinearity and ductile damage 2 tension experiment 2 1 specimen description the specimen was composed of a skin and three l shaped stringers as shown in fig 2 a the materials of the skin and stringers are 2060 t8 and 2099 t83 al li alloy respectively the chemical compositions and mechanical properties of the two al li alloys are shown in table 1 han et al 2017b the stress strain relationships of these two materials are described in zhang et al 2020 the skin and stringers were assembled by double sided laser beam welding with a welding power of 2400 w and a welding speed of 4 m min the dimensions of the specimen and effective test area were 776 mm 288 mm and 366 mm 200 mm respectively the distance between the stringers was 150 mm and the skin thickness was 2 mm to ensure load uniformity in the test area a circular arc transition was adopted between the clamping end and the test area l shaped stringers with a height of 28 mm and a width of 20 mm were adopted and the detailed dimensions are shown in fig 2 b 2 2 experiment procedure the ultimate tension strength of the laser welded stiffened plate was tested using a css 2205 electronic universal testing machine as shown in fig 3 the maximum loading capacity of the testing machine was 500 kn with a load error of 0 4 the test configuration was designed according to the guidance of astm e8 e8m 16 and the experiment purpose and then numerical simulation was used to ensure that the designed test configuration meets the test requirements each clamping end of the specimen was closely connected to the tensile fixture through three rows of bolts the bottom end of the specimen was fixed and the upper end was connected to the loading end of the testing machine the displacement loading mode with a loading rate of 0 5 mm min was selected before the formal test preloading was conducted to check the working status of the fixtures loading and measuring equipment the formal test was then carried out the bx120 5ca type resistance strain rosettes from ningbo yaonan electromechanical equipment co ltd were pasted on the surface near the welds to monitor the strain during the loading process three strain rosettes were evenly distributed on both sides of each stringer as shown in fig 4 there are three strain gauges on each strain rosette where 0 and 90 are parallel and perpendicular to the tensile direction respectively taking the first strain rosette as an example of numbering 0 45 and 90 strains are expressed as 1 0 1 45 and 1 90 respectively in addition dic a noncontact and nondestructive full field optical measurement technology which is widely used in various fields of experimental mechanics xie and kang 2015 jiang et al 2015 2020 fan et al 2020 is employed to monitor the evolution of the strain field on the back skin of the stiffened plate during the tension process before the specimen was assembled on the testing machine the back skin was sprayed with random white and black speckles the speckle images with a resolution of 1024 768 pixels were acquired using a ccd camera f080b the frame acquisition rate was 1 fps the strain field at different times can be obtained by a correlation calculation of speckle images 2 3 experiment results fig 5 a shows the load displacement curve of the stiffened plate when the load exceeded 156 1 kn the specimen was suddenly fractured at the lower weld and lost the load capacity as shown in fig 5 b due to the small weld area and the lower elongation of the weld compared to the base metal the plastic deformation that only occurs near the welds is much smaller than the overall deformation of the stiffened plate therefore the load displacement of the stiffened plate changes almost linearly and it suddenly fails after reaching the ultimate strength previous studies estefen et al 2012 li et al 2020 showed that high residual stresses coarse grains and material performance weakening near the weld often lead to premature failure of welded structures the current experimental results demonstrate the need for special attention to the weld area after careful observation it can be found that the slope of the curve for a displacement range of 0 2 mm is smaller compared to larger displacements in other words the stiffness of the specimen in the early loading stage is less than that in the later stage which is because a part of the load applied in the early stage is dissipated to eliminate welding deformation the strain load curves at typical locations are shown in fig 6 which are used to analyze the deformation at these key positions during the loading process the strains parallel to the tension direction are positive indicating that they are in the tensile stress state the strains perpendicular to the tensile direction are negative because the poisson effect causes the skin to shrink parallel to the weld thus they are in the compressive stress state in addition the strain increases linearly with the increase in load whereas the slopes of the curves increase near the ultimate strength the area of interest aoi of the optical measurement is shown in fig 7 the field strains of ε x and ε y in the aoi under different loads are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively as shown in fig 8 the strain concentration occurs near the weld and the strain in the weld area is significantly greater than that in other regions thus failure occurs at the weld location as shown in fig 9 when the load reaches 50 kn a shrinkage band with the weld as the symmetry axis appears indicating that the stringers play a role in restraining the transverse shrinkage of the skin the reason for this phenomenon is that the two sides of the weld are skin with a small stiffness thus the transverse shrinkage of the skin is large and that of the weld is small owing to the existence of the stringers in addition the number of shrinkage bands increases with the increase in load which indicates that the effect of stringers on restraining skin from shrinkage is more obvious 3 finite element model the establishment of a high precision finite element model fem can obtain more comprehensive structural stress and deformation calculations to deeply explore the deformation mechanism effectively analyze the influence factors of structural failure and guide structure design and welding process optimization in the numerical study welding deformation and residual stresses of the stiffened plate caused by double sided laser beam welding were simulated by sequentially coupled thermal mechanical analysis peri et al 2019a 2019b then the calculated welding deformation and residual stresses were introduced into the ultimate strength model as geometry defects and initial stresses in which material nonlinearity geometry nonlinearity and ductile damage were considered based on the ultimate strength model the effects of welding deformation and residual stresses on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate were studied and the failure mechanism was analyzed 3 1 welding simulation based on the abaqus commercial finite element software the fem was established according to the geometry dimensions of the stiffened plate tested in the tension experiment as shown in fig 10 the mesh density was determined by a study of mesh convergence by comparing the maximum temperature with different element sizes the fem contained 895 710 elements and 986 632 nodes with a minimum element size of 0 1 mm 0 1 mm 0 5 mm the element size away from the welded joints increases gradually in thermal and mechanical analyses the same finite element mesh was adopted but the element types were eight node linear hexahedral heat conduction element dc3d8 and eight node linear reduced integral stress element c3d8r that is also often used to decrease cpu time and storage requirements ahn et al 2018 zain ul abdein et al 2010 respectively 3 1 1 thermal analysis transient thermal analysis was used to determine the temperature field of the stiffened plate the temperature field φ x y z t satisfies the energy balance equation murakawa et al 2011 1 ρ c φ t x k x φ x y k y φ y z k z φ z ρ q 0 where ρ is the density of the material c is the specific heat capacity t is the transient time k x k y and k z are the thermal conductivities along three main directions x y z and q q x y z t is the heat source density goldak et al 1986 compared the temperature field predicted by adopting the temperature dependent or temperature independent thermal conductivity and specific heat with that measured experimentally and concluded that the temperature independent material properties cause a large error therefore the thermal physical properties varying with temperature are considered in the fem to improve the simulation accuracy the temperature dependent material properties of the 2060 t8 al li alloy come from the commercial aircraft corporation of china ltd and the reference yang et al 2020 those of 2099 t83 al li alloy were obtained by adjusting those of the 2060 t8 al li alloy according to the difference in material properties of these two alloys at room temperature xu and soares 2012b temperature dependent material properties of 2060 t8 and 2099 t83 al li alloy were illustrated in fig 11 during the welding process the heat exchange between the welded structures and the surrounding environment is conducted in the form of convection and radiation which are considered as boundary conditions in the thermal analysis the heat loss q h caused by convection and radiation can be calculated simultaneously as 2 q h α c t t 0 where α c is the temperature dependent composite heat release coefficient brown and song 1992 t 0 is the ambient temperature 20 c the heat source model describes the distribution and magnitude of the heat input on welded structures which has a crucial impact on the predicted temperature field and thus affects the mechanical field of the welded structures fu et al 2015 to accurately describe the heat input distribution of laser welding a combined heat source model composed of a double elliptic cone heat source q e and gaussian surface heat source q g was used to describe the heat input q com which can be expressed by eq 3 where β represents the relative contribution of the two heat sources to the heat input 3 q c o m x y z t β q g x y z t 1 β q c x y z t during the laser welding process the high temperature plasma cloud generated above the molten pool continuously radiates energy to the molten pool surface yang et al 2017 this energy is described by a gaussian surface heat source chen et al 2018 to control the weld width 4 q g x y z t 3 q π r 0 2 exp 3 x x 0 2 y y 0 v t 2 r 0 2 where q is the power input 2400 w v is the welding speed 4 m min x 0 y 0 z 0 is the initial position of the torch in the x y z coordinate system and r 0 is the effective radius of the gaussian heat source the double elliptic cone heat source model lundback and runnemalm 2005 is mainly employed to control the weld depth this model is divided into two parts where the front part is defined as 5 q c x y z 6 f f q a b c f π 1 d c exp 3 x x 0 2 a 2 3 y y 0 v t 2 c f 2 1 1 d c z b and the rear part is described as follows 6 q c x y z 6 f f q a b c r π 1 d c exp 3 x x 0 2 a 2 3 y y 0 v t 2 c r 2 1 1 d c z b where a b c f and c r are the shape parameters of the double elliptic cone heat source model q c is the heat flux generated by the model and f f and f r represent the front and rear heat apportionment of heat flux respectively the parameters of the combined heat source model are summarized in table 2 to ensure the continuity of the magnitude and distribution of the heat source the following equation should be satisfied nguyen et al 1999 7 f f 2 c f c f c r f f f r 2 3 1 2 mechanical analysis in the mechanical analysis the temperature fields in the entire welding process determined in the thermal analysis were introduced into the mechanical model as thermal loads thus the final welding deformation and residual stresses of the stiffened plate could be calculated to prevent rigid body displacements the displacement boundary conditions shown in fig 9 were constrained in the mechanical analysis in addition given the small thickness of the skin geometry nonlinearity is considered to improve the simulation accuracy as in the thermal analysis the temperature dependent mechanical properties were considered in the fem moreover it was assumed that the al li alloy is isotropic and obeys hooke s law when it is in an elastic state whereas the ideal elastic plastic model of von mises criterion was adopted for the plastic stage when the temperature is higher than the melting point of the material 650 c jin et al 2019 the elastic modulus and yield strength tend to be 0 however they were replaced by small values to improve the convergence and calculation efficiency having little effect on the final welding deformation and residual stresses zhu and chao 2002 3 2 ultimate strength simulation to study the influence of welding deformation residual stresses and ductile damage on the failure mode and ultimate strength of the stiffened plate five fems considering material nonlinearity geometry nonlinearity and ductile damage were established in abaqus explicit as shown in table 3 the ultimate strength and behavior of the laser welded stiffened plate under tension load were determined by applying the x direction displacement at one end of the fem and encastre boundary conditions at the other end for the fems without considering welding deformation fem ⅰ fem ⅲ the finite element mesh was the same as that in the mechanical analysis whereas for the fems considering welding deformation fem ⅱ fem ⅳ and fem ⅴ the deformed finite element mesh obtained in mechanical analysis was employed in addition the residual stresses calculated in section 3 1 2 could be introduced into the fem as the initial stress to consider the effect of residual stresses the adopted material model can be divided into three stages namely elastic stage plastic stage and softening stage elastic stage the material constitutive conforms to the generalized hooke s law 8 σ d ε where σ is the cauchy stress tensor ε is the strain tensor and d is hooke s elasticity tensor which is determined by the young s modulus e and poisson s ratio v plastic stage in the numerical model the skin and stringers adopt the isotropic hardening model which is expressed by defining the yield strengths under different plastic strains in the weld area due to the short hardening stage the ideal plastic model is used softening stage this stage is described by the ductile damage model during this stage the material exhibited a softening phenomenon until ductile fracture occurred due to the nucleation growth and coalescence of voids the damage initiation criterion of ductile materials is defined as 9 ω d d ε p l ε d p l η ε p l 1 where ω d is the state variable that increases monotonically with plastic strain ε p l is the equivalent plastic strain and ε d p l the equivalent plastic strain at the onset of damage is a function of the stress triaxiality η 1 3 bai and wierzbicki 2008 and equivalent plastic strain rate ε p l it was set to 0 0124 according to the stress strain relationships of the material zhang et al 2020 detailed descriptions can be referred to hooputra et al 2004 subsequently the evolution of the damage variable with the relative plastic displacement is specified in a linear form 10 d l ε p l u f p l u p l u f p l where d is the damage rate l is the characteristic length of the element u p l is the effective plastic displacement rate and u f p l is the effective plastic displacement at failure the weld material fails before the damage initiation of materials of the skin and stringers zhang et al 2020 so these two materials are not set for ductile damage in the numerical model for the weld material the weld almost has no softening stage zhang et al 2020 so u f p l is set to 0 4 results and discussion 4 1 temperature field the thermal analysis model was validated by comparing the weld morphologies obtained by metallographic experiment and thermal analysis as shown in fig 12 it can be seen that the numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental results moreover there was a steep temperature gradient in the weld area the predicted and measured results of the geometry dimensions of the t joint are shown in table 4 the errors between the numerical results and experiment results for height and width were 2 16 and 0 258 respectively the above results showed that the thermal analysis model can predict the temperature field of the laser welded stiffened plate which validated the thermal analysis model 4 2 welding deformation and residual stresses the predicted welding deformation and residual stresses mainly depend on the thermal and mechanical properties of materials boundary conditions and temperature fields the first two are set according to the actual situation and the thermal analysis used to predict temperature fields was validated by the weld morphology so the simulated welding deformation and residual stresses are effective and the measured deformation results also prove it fig 13 shows the out of plane displacement of the laser welded stiffened plate as can be seen from fig 13 a the maximum out of plane displacement of 6 948 mm occurred near the middle stringer which was approximately 3 5 times the skin thickness this demonstrated the necessity of considering geometry nonlinearity in the mechanical analysis fig 13 b depicts the measured and numerical results of out of plane displacement along line 1 where line 1 is perpendicular to the weld and located in the middle of the upper surface of the skin it can be seen that the measured results are basically consistent with the numerical results which validates the mechanical analysis of tep model the out of plane displacement of both sides of the middle stringer was almost the same on either side it could be divided into two linear segments and the gradient between the two stringers was gentler this was because the displacement in this area was simultaneously determined by the transverse bending of the welds near the two stringers and the effect of these transverse bending being opposite fig 14 shows the von mises stresses along line 1 due to the high heat concentration and rapid heating and cooling there are high von mises stresses in a very narrow area about 6 mm wide near every stringer up to 350 mpa whereas the von mises stresses were are in the areas far away from the welds local enlarged drawings of von mises stresses near the welds showed that the interaction among the welding processes of the three stringers was almost negligible due to the large distance between the stringers the magnitude and distribution of von mises stresses near each weld were almost the same in addition the highest von mises stresses occurred at the weld toes whereas the von mises stresses were reduced by 50 mpa in the areas between the welds the transverse residual stresses along line 1 are shown in fig 15 in the region within 10 mm around the stringers the stresses changed sharply whereas in other areas the stress level was close to 0 the reason is that the two welds of each stringer are not through as shown in fig 12 there is a sharp transition of base zone bz to heat affected zone haz to fusion zone fz to haz to fz to haz to bz from the local enlarged drawings it can be found that the transverse residual stresses at the weld toes were tensile stresses of approximately 37 mpa and the residual stresses were compressive stresses with a maximum value of 47 mpa in the base metal region near the weld toes moreover there were tensile stresses of approximately 35 mpa in the middle of the 2 welds however in the region far away from the welded joints the transverse residual stresses were close to 0 in addition it could be observed from the stress contour that there were high compressive stresses at both ends of the welds due to the thermal effects of arc starting and arc ending the longitudinal residual stresses along line 1 are shown in fig 16 there were residual tensile stresses of 320 mpa at the weld toes of the 6 welds the longitudinal residual stresses were approximately 60 mpa in the regions between the 2 welds of each stringer this may be because the simultaneous welding of both sides of the welds made the expansion and shrinkage neutralize and thus abated the residual stress level moreover due to the self balance of the stiffened plate there were small residual compressive stresses far away from the welds 4 3 ultimate strength when explicit dynamics analysis is employed to simulate a quasi static process the mass scaling technique can improve the solution efficiency hibbit et al 2014 however the kinetic energy should be far less than the internal energy to ensure the simulation accuracy in this study a mass scaling factor of 300 was adopted the kinetic energy and internal energy of the stiffened plate during loading are compared in fig 17 it can be seen that with the increase in load the internal energy increased rapidly whereas the increase in kinetic energy was almost negligible before failure the ratio of kinetic energy to internal energy was close to 0 which indicates that the mass scaling factor is reasonable and meets the requirements of quasi static simulation at failure the internal energy was released and the loading end velocity increased which caused the internal energy to decrease and the kinetic energy to suddenly increase this phenomenon is consistent with the tension experiment the failure modes of the laser welded stiffened plate predicted by the four fems are shown in fig 18 it can be seen that for the fem without considering welding deformation and residual stresses fem i the failure occurred at the middle stringer because the stiffened plate was symmetrical for the fems considering welding deformation or residual stresses fem ii fem iii the failure mode was that the main fracture occurred at the middle stringer and slight fractures occurred at the other two stringers for the fem considering both welding deformation and residual stress fem iv the fracture occurred at the lower stringer which was consistent with the phenomenon observed in the experiment fig 5 b it can be concluded that welding deformation and residual stress had an influence on the failure mode of laser welded stiffened plates and that the fem considering welding deformation and residual stress can predict the failure mode of stiffened plates the experimental and numerical results of the load displacement of the laser welded stiffened plate are compared in fig 19 the ultimate strength predicted by the fem considering welding deformation and residual stresses fem ⅳ was 158 8 kn which was 1 73 higher than the experiment result of 156 1 kn the two values were in good agreement however the predicted results when without considering welding deformation fem ⅲ without considering residual stress fem ⅱ without considering neither of them fem i and without considering ductile damage fem ⅴ were 11 15 11 08 12 24 and 12 62 larger than the experiment result respectively moreover it could be found that the stiffness predicted by the fems considering welding deformation fem ⅱ fem ⅳ was smaller than that predicted without considering welding deformation fem i fem ⅲ and that the residual stress had little effect on the stiffness of the stiffened plate in addition from the load displacement curves predicted by the fems considering welding deformation fem ⅱ fem ⅳ it could be found that the structural stiffness in the early loading stage the loading displacement was less than 2 mm was less than that in the subsequent loading stage which was consistent with the load displacement curve measured in the experiment this was because the welding deformation was mainly vertical deflection and a part of the loading displacement was dissipated in the elimination of the welding deformation in the early loading stage the numerical model without considering ductile damage fem ⅴ is unable to predict the sudden failure and failure mode instead the moment when the stiffened plate cannot continue to withstand higher loads due to yielding is regarded as the critical point of failure based on the above analysis the influence of welding deformation residual stresses and ductile damage should be carefully considered in the fem to accurately predict the ultimate strength of laser welded stiffened plates fig 20 shows the damage state in the cross section of weld at the fracture position under different loads it can be seen that the damage gradually increases as the load increases and the damage is mainly concentrated near the weld toe and the junction of the skin and stringer the accumulation of damage causes the stiffened plate to fracture at the weld toe which is consistent with the fact that welded structures often fractures at weld toes fig 21 shows the strain field ε x of the back skin near the middle stringer it can be seen that the strain concentration phenomenon at the stringer position was consistent with the experiment results fig 8 moreover for the fems without considering welding deformation fem ⅰ fem ⅲ the strain concentration was more obvious this was because in the finite element model considering welding deformation fem ⅱ fem ⅳ a part of loading displacement flattened the stiffened plate however whether the residual stress was considered or not had little effect on the strain field of ε x this might be due to the high level residual stresses mainly being concentrated in the very narrow areas near the welds fig 22 shows the strain field ε y of the back skin near the middle stringer the strain fields predicted by the four fems all appear the shrinkage band observed in fig 9 but at the same time it can be found that the strain fields between the shrinkage bands were relatively uniform in the fems that did not consider the residual stresses fem ⅰ fem ⅱ in the fems considering residual stresses fem ⅲ fem ⅳ the inhomogeneity of the strain fields between shrinkage bands were more significant which was similar to the fish scale like strain fields between the shrinkage bands measured by dic in fig 9 5 conclusion through the tension experiment of a laser welded stiffened plate its ultimate strength and failure mode were investigated and the failure mechanism was discussed based on the experimental results of dic and electrical measurement afterwards based on the fem considering geometry nonlinearity material nonlinearity and ductile damage the influence of welding deformation and residual stress on the ultimate strength and failure mode was discussed the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the load of the laser welded stiffened plate linearly changed with the increase of displacement during the loading process when the load reached 156 1 kn the specimen suddenly fractured at the weld of the lower stringer 2 the electrical measurement results showed that the strain increases roughly linearly with the increase in load during the loading process moreover it was in a state of tensile stress in the direction perpendicular to the weld and in a state of compressive stress in the direction parallel to the weld owing to the poisson effect 3 the dic measurement results and numerical results showed that the strain field ε y has strain concentration in the weld zones and the weld strength determined the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate in addition inclined shrinkage bands appeared on both sides of the stringer which indicated that the stringers inhibited the transverse shrinkage of the skin during the tension process 4 using the finite element method the variation of temperature and mechanical fields during the welding process were extensively studied a combined heat source model composed of a double elliptic cone heat source and a gaussian surface heat source was used to describe the heat input of double sided laser welding the error between the numerical and experimental results of the weld height and width were 2 16 and 0 258 respectively which validated the thermal analysis model the welding deformation of the stiffened plate was a mainly vertical deflection with a maximum value of 6 948 mm and there were high residual tensile stresses at the weld toes 5 the fem considering material nonlinearity geometry nonlinearity ductile damage welding deformation and residual stresses could predict the failure mode and ultimate strength of the stiffened plate the error of the ultimate strength between the numerical results and experimental results was 1 73 credit authorship contribution statement zhenfei guo conceptualization methodology investigation software data

et al 2017 studied the effect of welding conditions on weld shapes and welding deformation using the tep method the results show that the focus current significantly changes the weld shape resulting in various transverse shrinkage distributions and consequently determining transverse bending deformation colegrove et al 2009 compared the effects of various welding methods on welding deformation and residual stresses based on tep analysis a lot of research has been carried out on the influence of welding sequences on welding deformation and residual stresses and a better welding sequence has been given gannon et al 2010 chen et al 2015 fu et al 2016 bai et al 2018a 2018b schenk et al 2010 and zhang and wang 2019 studied the influence of constraint conditions on the welding deformation and residual stresses of stiffened plates the research results demonstrate that the constraint conditions have a significant influence on welding deformation but little influence on residual stresses welding deformation and residual stresses have adverse consequences on the stiffness and ultimate strength of welded structures honaryar et al 2020 soares 1988 ozguc et al 2007 proposed new simple design equations to predict the ultimate compressive strength of stiffened plates taking into account the initial imperfections of geometric deflections and residual stresses tatsumi and fujikubo 2020 used the nonlinear finite element method to analyze the collapse behavior and ultimate strength of a container ship under the combined action of hogging moment and bottom local loads xu and soares 2012a and 2012b simulated the ultimate strength of stiffened plates under uniaxial compression the influence of initial geometric imperfections was considered in the model and the results were compared with the experimental results they found that the initial geometric imperfections have a significant effect on the failure behavior of stiffened plates gannon et al 2012 employed the finite element method to simulate the residual stress field and deformation field caused by the welding process of stiffened plates and then considered these defects in the ultimate strength analysis the results showed that the residual stresses reduce the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate by 11 with a consequent reduction in the hull girder ultimate moment of 3 3 paulo et al 2014 measured the longitudinal residual stresses of friction stir welded specimens using the contour method and then introduced it as initial conditions into the numerical model to investigate the influence of longitudinal residual stresses on the overall compressive performance of welded plates the research showed that the existence of a residual stress field reduces the collapse load compared with a stress free model tekgoz et al 2015 analyzed the influence of residual stresses on the ultimate strength of rectangular stiffened plates by changing the heat input plate thickness and welding sequence it was found that the welding sequence has the most significant influence on the ultimate strength and that a reasonable welding sequence is beneficial for improving the ultimate strength of stiffened plates estefen et al 2016 studied the influence of the initial geometric imperfection mode on the buckling behavior and ultimate strength of stiffened plates by establishing a numerical model of a stiffened plate that can consider geometry nonlinearity and material nonlinearity the results showed that the collapse of the bottom plates is accelerated by geometry imperfections and the ultimate strength of the ship is reduced although stiffened plates are often used to resist longitudinal loads the ultimate strength of stiffened plates under transverse tensile loading sometimes also needs to be considered for example the small waterplane area twin hull swath are exposed to horizontal extreme wave loads the transverse ultimate strength is critical due to large stress concentrations in the narrow struts and haunches as shown in fig 1 moreover welded stiffened plates are more prone to failure under tension load owing to the superimposition of tensile stresses and the high residual tensile stresses near the welded joints in addition the ultimate strength of stiffened plates decreases gradually in the collapse stage under compression load while the fracture failure under tension load is sudden without any precursor and thus the load capacity is completely lost this phenomenon makes the tension load more likely to cause disastrous consequences than the compression load unfortunately research on the ultimate strength of welded structures under tension load is insufficient liu et al 2018 fujikubo et al 2005a 2005b heggelund et al 2000 in this study the ultimate tensile strength of a laser welded al li alloy stiffened plate was studied based on the experiment and numerical analysis first the ultimate strength failure mode and strain evolution were measured by tension experiment combined with digital image correlation dic and electrical measurement and the failure mechanism was also analyzed then the temperature field welding deformation and residual stresses of the stiffened plate were predicted based on the tep model and the model was validated by the measured weld morphology finally the effects of welding deformation and residual stresses on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate were studied by introducing welding deformation and residual stresses into the ultimate strength model considering material nonlinearity geometry nonlinearity and ductile damage 2 tension experiment 2 1 specimen description the specimen was composed of a skin and three l shaped stringers as shown in fig 2 a the materials of the skin and stringers are 2060 t8 and 2099 t83 al li alloy respectively the chemical compositions and mechanical properties of the two al li alloys are shown in table 1 han et al 2017b the stress strain relationships of these two materials are described in zhang et al 2020 the skin and stringers were assembled by double sided laser beam welding with a welding power of 2400 w and a welding speed of 4 m min the dimensions of the specimen and effective test area were 776 mm 288 mm and 366 mm 200 mm respectively the distance between the stringers was 150 mm and the skin thickness was 2 mm to ensure load uniformity in the test area a circular arc transition was adopted between the clamping end and the test area l shaped stringers with a height of 28 mm and a width of 20 mm were adopted and the detailed dimensions are shown in fig 2 b 2 2 experiment procedure the ultimate tension strength of the laser welded stiffened plate was tested using a css 2205 electronic universal testing machine as shown in fig 3 the maximum loading capacity of the testing machine was 500 kn with a load error of 0 4 the test configuration was designed according to the guidance of astm e8 e8m 16 and the experiment purpose and then numerical simulation was used to ensure that the designed test configuration meets the test requirements each clamping end of the specimen was closely connected to the tensile fixture through three rows of bolts the bottom end of the specimen was fixed and the upper end was connected to the loading end of the testing machine the displacement loading mode with a loading rate of 0 5 mm min was selected before the formal test preloading was conducted to check the working status of the fixtures loading and measuring equipment the formal test was then carried out the bx120 5ca type resistance strain rosettes from ningbo yaonan electromechanical equipment co ltd were pasted on the surface near the welds to monitor the strain during the loading process three strain rosettes were evenly distributed on both sides of each stringer as shown in fig 4 there are three strain gauges on each strain rosette where 0 and 90 are parallel and perpendicular to the tensile direction respectively taking the first strain rosette as an example of numbering 0 45 and 90 strains are expressed as 1 0 1 45 and 1 90 respectively in addition dic a noncontact and nondestructive full field optical measurement technology which is widely used in various fields of experimental mechanics xie and kang 2015 jiang et al 2015 2020 fan et al 2020 is employed to monitor the evolution of the strain field on the back skin of the stiffened plate during the tension process before the specimen was assembled on the testing machine the back skin was sprayed with random white and black speckles the speckle images with a resolution of 1024 768 pixels were acquired using a ccd camera f080b the frame acquisition rate was 1 fps the strain field at different times can be obtained by a correlation calculation of speckle images 2 3 experiment results fig 5 a shows the load displacement curve of the stiffened plate when the load exceeded 156 1 kn the specimen was suddenly fractured at the lower weld and lost the load capacity as shown in fig 5 b due to the small weld area and the lower elongation of the weld compared to the base metal the plastic deformation that only occurs near the welds is much smaller than the overall deformation of the stiffened plate therefore the load displacement of the stiffened plate changes almost linearly and it suddenly fails after reaching the ultimate strength previous studies estefen et al 2012 li et al 2020 showed that high residual stresses coarse grains and material performance weakening near the weld often lead to premature failure of welded structures the current experimental results demonstrate the need for special attention to the weld area after careful observation it can be found that the slope of the curve for a displacement range of 0 2 mm is smaller compared to larger displacements in other words the stiffness of the specimen in the early loading stage is less than that in the later stage which is because a part of the load applied in the early stage is dissipated to eliminate welding deformation the strain load curves at typical locations are shown in fig 6 which are used to analyze the deformation at these key positions during the loading process the strains parallel to the tension direction are positive indicating that they are in the tensile stress state the strains perpendicular to the tensile direction are negative because the poisson effect causes the skin to shrink parallel to the weld thus they are in the compressive stress state in addition the strain increases linearly with the increase in load whereas the slopes of the curves increase near the ultimate strength the area of interest aoi of the optical measurement is shown in fig 7 the field strains of ε x and ε y in the aoi under different loads are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively as shown in fig 8 the strain concentration occurs near the weld and the strain in the weld area is significantly greater than that in other regions thus failure occurs at the weld location as shown in fig 9 when the load reaches 50 kn a shrinkage band with the weld as the symmetry axis appears indicating that the stringers play a role in restraining the transverse shrinkage of the skin the reason for this phenomenon is that the two sides of the weld are skin with a small stiffness thus the transverse shrinkage of the skin is large and that of the weld is small owing to the existence of the stringers in addition the number of shrinkage bands increases with the increase in load which indicates that the effect of stringers on restraining skin from shrinkage is more obvious 3 finite element model the establishment of a high precision finite element model fem can obtain more comprehensive structural stress and deformation calculations to deeply explore the deformation mechanism effectively analyze the influence factors of structural failure and guide structure design and welding process optimization in the numerical study welding deformation and residual stresses of the stiffened plate caused by double sided laser beam welding were simulated by sequentially coupled thermal mechanical analysis peri et al 2019a 2019b then the calculated welding deformation and residual stresses were introduced into the ultimate strength model as geometry defects and initial stresses in which material nonlinearity geometry nonlinearity and ductile damage were considered based on the ultimate strength model the effects of welding deformation and residual stresses on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate were studied and the failure mechanism was analyzed 3 1 welding simulation based on the abaqus commercial finite element software the fem was established according to the geometry dimensions of the stiffened plate tested in the tension experiment as shown in fig 10 the mesh density was determined by a study of mesh convergence by comparing the maximum temperature with different element sizes the fem contained 895 710 elements and 986 632 nodes with a minimum element size of 0 1 mm 0 1 mm 0 5 mm the element size away from the welded joints increases gradually in thermal and mechanical analyses the same finite element mesh was adopted but the element types were eight node linear hexahedral heat conduction element dc3d8 and eight node linear reduced integral stress element c3d8r that is also often used to decrease cpu time and storage requirements ahn et al 2018 zain ul abdein et al 2010 respectively 3 1 1 thermal analysis transient thermal analysis was used to determine the temperature field of the stiffened plate the temperature field φ x y z t satisfies the energy balance equation murakawa et al 2011 1 ρ c φ t x k x φ x y k y φ y z k z φ z ρ q 0 where ρ is the density of the material c is the specific heat capacity t is the transient time k x k y and k z are the thermal conductivities along three main directions x y z and q q x y z t is the heat source density goldak et al 1986 compared the temperature field predicted by adopting the temperature dependent or temperature independent thermal conductivity and specific heat with that measured experimentally and concluded that the temperature independent material properties cause a large error therefore the thermal physical properties varying with temperature are considered in the fem to improve the simulation accuracy the temperature dependent material properties of the 2060 t8 al li alloy come from the commercial aircraft corporation of china ltd and the reference yang et al 2020 those of 2099 t83 al li alloy were obtained by adjusting those of the 2060 t8 al li alloy according to the difference in material properties of these two alloys at room temperature xu and soares 2012b temperature dependent material properties of 2060 t8 and 2099 t83 al li alloy were illustrated in fig 11 during the welding process the heat exchange between the welded structures and the surrounding environment is conducted in the form of convection and radiation which are considered as boundary conditions in the thermal analysis the heat loss q h caused by convection and radiation can be calculated simultaneously as 2 q h α c t t 0 where α c is the temperature dependent composite heat release coefficient brown and song 1992 t 0 is the ambient temperature 20 c the heat source model describes the distribution and magnitude of the heat input on welded structures which has a crucial impact on the predicted temperature field and thus affects the mechanical field of the welded structures fu et al 2015 to accurately describe the heat input distribution of laser welding a combined heat source model composed of a double elliptic cone heat source q e and gaussian surface heat source q g was used to describe the heat input q com which can be expressed by eq 3 where β represents the relative contribution of the two heat sources to the heat input 3 q c o m x y z t β q g x y z t 1 β q c x y z t during the laser welding process the high temperature plasma cloud generated above the molten pool continuously radiates energy to the molten pool surface yang et al 2017 this energy is described by a gaussian surface heat source chen et al 2018 to control the weld width 4 q g x y z t 3 q π r 0 2 exp 3 x x 0 2 y y 0 v t 2 r 0 2 where q is the power input 2400 w v is the welding speed 4 m min x 0 y 0 z 0 is the initial position of the torch in the x y z coordinate system and r 0 is the effective radius of the gaussian heat source the double elliptic cone heat source model lundback and runnemalm 2005 is mainly employed to control the weld depth this model is divided into two parts where the front part is defined as 5 q c x y z 6 f f q a b c f π 1 d c exp 3 x x 0 2 a 2 3 y y 0 v t 2 c f 2 1 1 d c z b and the rear part is described as follows 6 q c x y z 6 f f q a b c r π 1 d c exp 3 x x 0 2 a 2 3 y y 0 v t 2 c r 2 1 1 d c z b where a b c f and c r are the shape parameters of the double elliptic cone heat source model q c is the heat flux generated by the model and f f and f r represent the front and rear heat apportionment of heat flux respectively the parameters of the combined heat source model are summarized in table 2 to ensure the continuity of the magnitude and distribution of the heat source the following equation should be satisfied nguyen et al 1999 7 f f 2 c f c f c r f f f r 2 3 1 2 mechanical analysis in the mechanical analysis the temperature fields in the entire welding process determined in the thermal analysis were introduced into the mechanical model as thermal loads thus the final welding deformation and residual stresses of the stiffened plate could be calculated to prevent rigid body displacements the displacement boundary conditions shown in fig 9 were constrained in the mechanical analysis in addition given the small thickness of the skin geometry nonlinearity is considered to improve the simulation accuracy as in the thermal analysis the temperature dependent mechanical properties were considered in the fem moreover it was assumed that the al li alloy is isotropic and obeys hooke s law when it is in an elastic state whereas the ideal elastic plastic model of von mises criterion was adopted for the plastic stage when the temperature is higher than the melting point of the material 650 c jin et al 2019 the elastic modulus and yield strength tend to be 0 however they were replaced by small values to improve the convergence and calculation efficiency having little effect on the final welding deformation and residual stresses zhu and chao 2002 3 2 ultimate strength simulation to study the influence of welding deformation residual stresses and ductile damage on the failure mode and ultimate strength of the stiffened plate five fems considering material nonlinearity geometry nonlinearity and ductile damage were established in abaqus explicit as shown in table 3 the ultimate strength and behavior of the laser welded stiffened plate under tension load were determined by applying the x direction displacement at one end of the fem and encastre boundary conditions at the other end for the fems without considering welding deformation fem ⅰ fem ⅲ the finite element mesh was the same as that in the mechanical analysis whereas for the fems considering welding deformation fem ⅱ fem ⅳ and fem ⅴ the deformed finite element mesh obtained in mechanical analysis was employed in addition the residual stresses calculated in section 3 1 2 could be introduced into the fem as the initial stress to consider the effect of residual stresses the adopted material model can be divided into three stages namely elastic stage plastic stage and softening stage elastic stage the material constitutive conforms to the generalized hooke s law 8 σ d ε where σ is the cauchy stress tensor ε is the strain tensor and d is hooke s elasticity tensor which is determined by the young s modulus e and poisson s ratio v plastic stage in the numerical model the skin and stringers adopt the isotropic hardening model which is expressed by defining the yield strengths under different plastic strains in the weld area due to the short hardening stage the ideal plastic model is used softening stage this stage is described by the ductile damage model during this stage the material exhibited a softening phenomenon until ductile fracture occurred due to the nucleation growth and coalescence of voids the damage initiation criterion of ductile materials is defined as 9 ω d d ε p l ε d p l η ε p l 1 where ω d is the state variable that increases monotonically with plastic strain ε p l is the equivalent plastic strain and ε d p l the equivalent plastic strain at the onset of damage is a function of the stress triaxiality η 1 3 bai and wierzbicki 2008 and equivalent plastic strain rate ε p l it was set to 0 0124 according to the stress strain relationships of the material zhang et al 2020 detailed descriptions can be referred to hooputra et al 2004 subsequently the evolution of the damage variable with the relative plastic displacement is specified in a linear form 10 d l ε p l u f p l u p l u f p l where d is the damage rate l is the characteristic length of the element u p l is the effective plastic displacement rate and u f p l is the effective plastic displacement at failure the weld material fails before the damage initiation of materials of the skin and stringers zhang et al 2020 so these two materials are not set for ductile damage in the numerical model for the weld material the weld almost has no softening stage zhang et al 2020 so u f p l is set to 0 4 results and discussion 4 1 temperature field the thermal analysis model was validated by comparing the weld morphologies obtained by metallographic experiment and thermal analysis as shown in fig 12 it can be seen that the numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental results moreover there was a steep temperature gradient in the weld area the predicted and measured results of the geometry dimensions of the t joint are shown in table 4 the errors between the numerical results and experiment results for height and width were 2 16 and 0 258 respectively the above results showed that the thermal analysis model can predict the temperature field of the laser welded stiffened plate which validated the thermal analysis model 4 2 welding deformation and residual stresses the predicted welding deformation and residual stresses mainly depend on the thermal and mechanical properties of materials boundary conditions and temperature fields the first two are set according to the actual situation and the thermal analysis used to predict temperature fields was validated by the weld morphology so the simulated welding deformation and residual stresses are effective and the measured deformation results also prove it fig 13 shows the out of plane displacement of the laser welded stiffened plate as can be seen from fig 13 a the maximum out of plane displacement of 6 948 mm occurred near the middle stringer which was approximately 3 5 times the skin thickness this demonstrated the necessity of considering geometry nonlinearity in the mechanical analysis fig 13 b depicts the measured and numerical results of out of plane displacement along line 1 where line 1 is perpendicular to the weld and located in the middle of the upper surface of the skin it can be seen that the measured results are basically consistent with the numerical results which validates the mechanical analysis of tep model the out of plane displacement of both sides of the middle stringer was almost the same on either side it could be divided into two linear segments and the gradient between the two stringers was gentler this was because the displacement in this area was simultaneously determined by the transverse bending of the welds near the two stringers and the effect of these transverse bending being opposite fig 14 shows the von mises stresses along line 1 due to the high heat concentration and rapid heating and cooling there are high von mises stresses in a very narrow area about 6 mm wide near every stringer up to 350 mpa whereas the von mises stresses were are in the areas far away from the welds local enlarged drawings of von mises stresses near the welds showed that the interaction among the welding processes of the three stringers was almost negligible due to the large distance between the stringers the magnitude and distribution of von mises stresses near each weld were almost the same in addition the highest von mises stresses occurred at the weld toes whereas the von mises stresses were reduced by 50 mpa in the areas between the welds the transverse residual stresses along line 1 are shown in fig 15 in the region within 10 mm around the stringers the stresses changed sharply whereas in other areas the stress level was close to 0 the reason is that the two welds of each stringer are not through as shown in fig 12 there is a sharp transition of base zone bz to heat affected zone haz to fusion zone fz to haz to fz to haz to bz from the local enlarged drawings it can be found that the transverse residual stresses at the weld toes were tensile stresses of approximately 37 mpa and the residual stresses were compressive stresses with a maximum value of 47 mpa in the base metal region near the weld toes moreover there were tensile stresses of approximately 35 mpa in the middle of the 2 welds however in the region far away from the welded joints the transverse residual stresses were close to 0 in addition it could be observed from the stress contour that there were high compressive stresses at both ends of the welds due to the thermal effects of arc starting and arc ending the longitudinal residual stresses along line 1 are shown in fig 16 there were residual tensile stresses of 320 mpa at the weld toes of the 6 welds the longitudinal residual stresses were approximately 60 mpa in the regions between the 2 welds of each stringer this may be because the simultaneous welding of both sides of the welds made the expansion and shrinkage neutralize and thus abated the residual stress level moreover due to the self balance of the stiffened plate there were small residual compressive stresses far away from the welds 4 3 ultimate strength when explicit dynamics analysis is employed to simulate a quasi static process the mass scaling technique can improve the solution efficiency hibbit et al 2014 however the kinetic energy should be far less than the internal energy to ensure the simulation accuracy in this study a mass scaling factor of 300 was adopted the kinetic energy and internal energy of the stiffened plate during loading are compared in fig 17 it can be seen that with the increase in load the internal energy increased rapidly whereas the increase in kinetic energy was almost negligible before failure the ratio of kinetic energy to internal energy was close to 0 which indicates that the mass scaling factor is reasonable and meets the requirements of quasi static simulation at failure the internal energy was released and the loading end velocity increased which caused the internal energy to decrease and the kinetic energy to suddenly increase this phenomenon is consistent with the tension experiment the failure modes of the laser welded stiffened plate predicted by the four fems are shown in fig 18 it can be seen that for the fem without considering welding deformation and residual stresses fem i the failure occurred at the middle stringer because the stiffened plate was symmetrical for the fems considering welding deformation or residual stresses fem ii fem iii the failure mode was that the main fracture occurred at the middle stringer and slight fractures occurred at the other two stringers for the fem considering both welding deformation and residual stress fem iv the fracture occurred at the lower stringer which was consistent with the phenomenon observed in the experiment fig 5 b it can be concluded that welding deformation and residual stress had an influence on the failure mode of laser welded stiffened plates and that the fem considering welding deformation and residual stress can predict the failure mode of stiffened plates the experimental and numerical results of the load displacement of the laser welded stiffened plate are compared in fig 19 the ultimate strength predicted by the fem considering welding deformation and residual stresses fem ⅳ was 158 8 kn which was 1 73 higher than the experiment result of 156 1 kn the two values were in good agreement however the predicted results when without considering welding deformation fem ⅲ without considering residual stress fem ⅱ without considering neither of them fem i and without considering ductile damage fem ⅴ were 11 15 11 08 12 24 and 12 62 larger than the experiment result respectively moreover it could be found that the stiffness predicted by the fems considering welding deformation fem ⅱ fem ⅳ was smaller than that predicted without considering welding deformation fem i fem ⅲ and that the residual stress had little effect on the stiffness of the stiffened plate in addition from the load displacement curves predicted by the fems considering welding deformation fem ⅱ fem ⅳ it could be found that the structural stiffness in the early loading stage the loading displacement was less than 2 mm was less than that in the subsequent loading stage which was consistent with the load displacement curve measured in the experiment this was because the welding deformation was mainly vertical deflection and a part of the loading displacement was dissipated in the elimination of the welding deformation in the early loading stage the numerical model without considering ductile damage fem ⅴ is unable to predict the sudden failure and failure mode instead the moment when the stiffened plate cannot continue to withstand higher loads due to yielding is regarded as the critical point of failure based on the above analysis the influence of welding deformation residual stresses and ductile damage should be carefully considered in the fem to accurately predict the ultimate strength of laser welded stiffened plates fig 20 shows the damage state in the cross section of weld at the fracture position under different loads it can be seen that the damage gradually increases as the load increases and the damage is mainly concentrated near the weld toe and the junction of the skin and stringer the accumulation of damage causes the stiffened plate to fracture at the weld toe which is consistent with the fact that welded structures often fractures at weld toes fig 21 shows the strain field ε x of the back skin near the middle stringer it can be seen that the strain concentration phenomenon at the stringer position was consistent with the experiment results fig 8 moreover for the fems without considering welding deformation fem ⅰ fem ⅲ the strain concentration was more obvious this was because in the finite element model considering welding deformation fem ⅱ fem ⅳ a part of loading displacement flattened the stiffened plate however whether the residual stress was considered or not had little effect on the strain field of ε x this might be due to the high level residual stresses mainly being concentrated in the very narrow areas near the welds fig 22 shows the strain field ε y of the back skin near the middle stringer the strain fields predicted by the four fems all appear the shrinkage band observed in fig 9 but at the same time it can be found that the strain fields between the shrinkage bands were relatively uniform in the fems that did not consider the residual stresses fem ⅰ fem ⅱ in the fems considering residual stresses fem ⅲ fem ⅳ the inhomogeneity of the strain fields between shrinkage bands were more significant which was similar to the fish scale like strain fields between the shrinkage bands measured by dic in fig 9 5 conclusion through the tension experiment of a laser welded stiffened plate its ultimate strength and failure mode were investigated and the failure mechanism was discussed based on the experimental results of dic and electrical measurement afterwards based on the fem considering geometry nonlinearity material nonlinearity and ductile damage the influence of welding deformation and residual stress on the ultimate strength and failure mode was discussed the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the load of the laser welded stiffened plate linearly changed with the increase of displacement during the loading process when the load reached 156 1 kn the specimen suddenly fractured at the weld of the lower stringer 2 the electrical measurement results showed that the strain increases roughly linearly with the increase in load during the loading process moreover it was in a state of tensile stress in the direction perpendicular to the weld and in a state of compressive stress in the direction parallel to the weld owing to the poisson effect 3 the dic measurement results and numerical results showed that the strain field ε y has strain concentration in the weld zones and the weld strength determined the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate in addition inclined shrinkage bands appeared on both sides of the stringer which indicated that the stringers inhibited the transverse shrinkage of the skin during the tension process 4 using the finite element method the variation of temperature and mechanical fields during the welding process were extensively studied a combined heat source model composed of a double elliptic cone heat source and a gaussian surface heat source was used to describe the heat input of double sided laser welding the error between the numerical and experimental results of the weld height and width were 2 16 and 0 258 respectively which validated the thermal analysis model the welding deformation of the stiffened plate was a mainly vertical deflection with a maximum value of 6 948 mm and there were high residual tensile stresses at the weld toes 5 the fem considering material nonlinearity geometry nonlinearity ductile damage welding deformation and residual stresses could predict the failure mode and ultimate strength of the stiffened plate the error of the ultimate strength between the numerical results and experimental results was 1 73 credit authorship contribution statement zhenfei guo conceptualization methodology investigation software data

multihull catamaran advancing in forward motion in still water broglia et al 2019 a numerical method has also been presented to solve aerodynamics of partial air cushion supported catamaran pacscat by combining 2 5d hydrodynamics of demihulls with simplified wave equation guo et al 2015 interference effects between demi hulls for a fast catamaran were investigated through cfd simulation and experimental data zaghi et al 2011 reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are the most widely used for turbulence modelling and have thus been shown to be a valid approach for seakeeping and resistance prediction the capability of an unsteady rans code was assessed to predict the seakeeping characteristics of a high speed multi hull ship in high sea states allowing for the inclusion of nonlinear effects castiglione et al 2011 najafi et al 2015 investigated the effect of an active transom interceptor in controlling unpleasant motion accelerations and resulting loads of high speed planing catamarans through numerical cfd rans simulation in addition the cfd method is widely used as an optimization tool to enhance hull design and estimate a ship s drag and resistance tezdogan et al 2015 haase et al 2016 bouscasse et al 2013 and he et al 2013 in relation to wave piercing catamarans the global and slamming loads have been investigated by lavroff et al 2017 and mcvicar et al 2016 who investigated wave impact loads on incat hull 64 a 112 m high speed wave piercing catamaran through full scale experimental work numerical simulation using both cfd and fea and model scale experiments the magnitude of the wave slamming loads and bending moments acting on a 112 m wave piercing catamaran were also investigated by shabani et al 2018 wave slam in random headseas on wave piercing catamarans was studied through model test on a 2 5 m of hydro elastic model davis et al 2017 and swidan et al 2017 alavimehr et al 2019 studied the influence of the control algorithms on the slamming kinematics water entry impulse and energy transfer forward speed and wave encounter frequency effects on slamming and whipping have been studied by mcvicar et al 2016 by using rans cfd to identify transient slam loads on a 112 m catamaran hydroelastic slam induced bending of wave piercing catamarans in head seas is then investigated through fluid structure interaction fsi cfd simulations at model scale mcvicar et al 2018 the estimation of slam loads acting on high speed wave piercing catamarans was conducted using one way fsi two way fsi and rigid cfd models comparison with experimental model scale results showed a high agreement of load estimation using fsi and internal forces calculated using a rigid body model in the research work previously undertaken it is noted that cfd work simulated motions and loads of model tests which were conducted in regular waves the current paper extends this to investigate full scale sea trials of a high speed wave piercing incat catamaran which were conducted in real irregular seas numerical cfd runs are undertaken to realistically simulate sea trials run of full scale high speed catamaran high speed catamaran global loads consist of longitudinal bending moment lbm transverse bending moment tbm pitch connecting moment pcm shear and splitting forces these loads are a function of many variables including the ship forward speed and heading relative to incident waves longitudinal bending moment is one of the main global loads occurring at all heading angles and is used as a central basis for determining the hull structural design records of wave elevation motion responses and strain gauges were collected from sea trial runs of hsv2 swift fig 1 as undertaken by the naval surface warfare centre carderock division nswccd these sea trials were undertaken in various sea conditions speeds and heading angles cfd simulation of the head sea runs in irregular seas at 20 knots are compared to study global loads prediction longitudinal bending moment lbm transverse bending moment tbm splitting forces and prying moments are evaluated for this cfd simulation using rigid body dynamics and compared to the sea trials results for the head seas case 2 hsv 2 swift incat catamaran hull 061 incat catamaran hsv 2 swift was built and commissioned in hobart australia in 2004 the main particulars of hsv 2 are presented in table 1 a large number of sea trials runs were performed by the nswccd near norway to extensively assess motion and structural responses of the vessel under a wide range of sea conditions the sea trials consisted of 157 runs each of duration 20 25 min grouped into 22 octagons each occurring at a specific sea state speed wave height and period each octagon consisted of 5 8 runs at different heading angles for octagons with five runs the three remaining sides of the octagon were assumed to be equivalent by symmetry accelerometers were fitted to record ship motions including roll pitch and yaw rates and vertical accelerations at the lcg of the vessel and bridge locations brady et al 2004 wind and wave environment were also monitored and recorded a tsurumi seiki co ltd tsk wave radar and accelerometer were installed on the centreline of the vessel at the bow of the ship to measure the height of the encountered wave and corresponding motion hsv 2 was fitted with a large number of strain gauges designed to pick up different responses these gauges were divided into 4 groups the first group was dedicated to primary global loads the second group of strain gauges was dedicated to stress concentration at specific locations around the ship the third group was dedicated to secondary loads such as wave impact in the forward region of the ship the fourth group was dedicated to strain responses at specific locations such as the aft ramp crane and helicopter deck 3 method the raw data from both the experimental and cfd approaches require processing to enable global loads to be determined for the experimental data strains are recorded which require conversion using a structural model to estimate the load magnitude required to induce them whereas in cfd the pressure distribution and hull motion acceleration are converted using a longitudinal mass distribution and rigid body dynamics catamaran global loads can be estimated by applying the load transfer matrix to strain gauge records from sea trials runs almallah et al 2019a and almallah et al 2020 essentially loads as defined by the classification society rules dnv gl are applied to the finite element model of the ship and the strains are determined at the locations of the relevant strain gauges on the actual ship with some redundancy a least squares fit is then applied to determine the static load case multipliers in terms of the measured strains this is then applied to the sea trials data to determine the global loads that are equivalent to the dynamic loads experienced in service catamaran global loads are also estimated through computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation wave characteristics in cfd are determined from sea trial reports and then applied in the cfd run using standard jonswap sea spectrum the resulting pressure distributions in the cfd are then applied to a rigid body dynamic model of the ship to determine the internal forces and moments at key cross sections taking into account the vessel mass distribution 3 1 rigid body dynamics the internal global loads are estimated through hydrodynamic pressure motion and inertia responses holloway et al 2003 the vertical longitudinal bending moment lbm is estimated by equation 1 as follows derived by summing moments of pressure motion and inertia forces about the selected section 1 m y m x x g g h x g p m h y i y p where h and p are heave and pitch acceleration at the centre of gravity cg respectively m x x g x g and i y are mass sectional properties of the forward segment g is the gravitational acceleration and m h y is the longitudinal hydrodynamic moment on the segment evaluated at the aft end of segment about the y axis positive directions of these terms are shown in fig 2 with the internal forces applying to the shaded section positive longitudinal bending moments lbm correspond to sagging moments and negative to hogging fig 2 shows the main forces and moments essential for calculation of internal bending moment at a specified section at distance x measured from the forward end of the catamaran the vertical transverse bending moment tbm is determined using a similar approach taking a longitudinal cut to form a port side segment at any distance y measured from the ship side as shown in fig 3 equation 2 as follows shows the summation of moments about the segment 2 m x m y y g g h y g r m h x i x r where m y y g y g and i x are mass sectional properties of the segment g is the gravitational acceleration r is roll angular acceleration and m h x is the transverse hydrodynamic moment on the segment evaluated at the centreline end of the segment about the x axis in addition split force and prying moment are estimated to investigate the lateral loading on the catamaran in headseas the total force in the y direction is measured at several segments on the demihull prying moment is estimated by summing moments of all split forces about the z axis at the catamaran midship fig 4 shows split forces on the inner demihulls in the y direction and prying moments estimated at the midship position 3 2 cfd modelling computational fluid dynamics cfd analyses are performed in this study using star ccm code v12 04 simulations are performed at full scale with conditions matching the conditions reported for the sea trial runs undertaken at 20 knots in order to investigate the prediction method of the internal global loads the volume of fluid vof method is used to divide the full fluid domain into two fluid phases air and water in each mesh cell a volume fraction α i of each phase is defined such that i 1 n α i 1 always for most cells α i will be 1 for one of the phases and 0 for the other but takes fractional values when the free surface passes through a cell the location of the free surface is defined by solving for α i in such cells the fluid model used in this cfd analysis is based on implicit unsteady flow equations with a multiphase segregated flow solver to capture the interface with the air domain since the main target of this study is to estimate global loads on the catamaran hull which arise mainly from the water pressures normal to the hull surfaces an inviscid fluid model is applied to reduce computational time this is justified as discussed in section 3 3 to follow for incompressible flows the averaged continuity equation and euler inviscid flow equation are written in tensor form and cartesian coordinates as follows 3 ρ t ρ v 0 4 ρ d v d t p ρ g where d v d t is time rate of change within the control volume moving with the fluid p is the pressure and ρ is the fluid density which is invariant within each phase but can vary in cells through which the free surface passes being ρ i 1 n α i ρ i where α i is the volume fraction of each phase cd adapco 2017 states that the solution solves transport equations of each phase for mass momentum and energy while all the phases have the same pressure field the eulerian averaging of the transport equations leads to additional interaction between the phases cd adapco 2017 describes the vof method as being well suited to simulating flows of several immiscible fluids on numerical grids capable of resolving the interface between the phases of the mixture it is an efficient model for flows in which each phase is a large continuous region the domain block size is set to allow the irregular waves to develop between inlet and outlet and the catamaran hull following guidelines of ittc ittc 2011 irregular waves are generated using jonswap sea spectrum fig 5 shows the cfd model adopted in this study with domain size the length of the domain block is set to 400 m width is 125 m and depth is 325 m the domain has a moving reference frame yz moving with the mean forward speed of the ship the domain width assures that the developed motions of the catamaran in waves are free from any significant reflections that might occur at the sides a wave monitor is placed 60 m from the inlet plane forward of the hull to record wave elevation before it is encountered by the hull wave damping is applied near the outlet boundary to minimise any wave reflection from the outlet surface back to the model in order to reduce cpu running time and computational requirements only half of the catamaran hull the port side is used a symmetry boundary condition is applied at the centreline of the catamaran along the domain side face in order to accurately simulate the other half of the model fig 5 shows that the velocity inlet boundary condition is set in the y z plane at the positive x domain extremity where irregular waves are generated the opposite y z plane was modelled as a pressure outlet the top and bottom boundaries are both specified as velocity inlets the side of the domain the positive y direction also has a velocity inlet boundary condition an overset mesh is used to facilitate motions of the full scale catamaran model this option allows the mesh around the ship model to translate and rotate with the catamaran within the bounds of the fixed mesh of the domain and the solution is interpolated between the two meshes the overset block is 145 m in length 30 m in width and 55 m in depth in order to simulate realistic full scale catamaran performance a dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi model is applied with two degrees of freedom heave and pitch the dfbi model enabled the solver to calculate the excitation force and moments acting on the catamaran due to hydrodynamic pressure in head waves an irregular wave model is chosen to simulate the sea trial runs that were undertaken in open sea water since the trials were conducted in the north sea a jonswap joint north sea wave project wave spectrum is selected to model headseas waves equation 5 shows the basic formulation of the jonswap sea wave spectrum cd adapco 2017 5 s ω 1 0 287 ln γ 5 16 h s 2 ω p 4 ω 5 e 5 4 ω p ω 4 γ e ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 2 where ω is the wave frequency ω p is the peak wave frequency σ is the spectral width parameter h s is the significant wave height γ is the non dimensional peak shape parameter the mesh is refined near the hull and with the exception of the free surface region element size is gradually increased towards the domain boundaries the free surface mesh is refined through the entire domain and only coarsened towards the outlet fig 6 shows the mesh for the fluid domain surrounding the catamaran hull the smallest vertical size of fluid mesh elements close to the hull was set to 0 3125 m and the largest elements in the mesh were 5 m the total number of cells in the mesh grid in the proposed cfd model is 1 54 106 cells the time step used was 0 01 s with 10 maximum inner iterations those values have been adopted in previous studies on similar ships and were found to give reasonable accuracy for estimation of global loads and motions in full scale and model scale simulations almallah et al 2019b mcvicar et al 2018 3 3 verification and validation of the cfd model several cfd simulation runs were undertaken in order to verify and validate the proposed full scale cfd model in this study since the global loads are motion induced it is important to ensure that the cfd analysis provides similar motion responses to the sea trial runs cfd simulations at model scale were previously investigated at a wide range of wave conditions during towing tank tests mcvicar et al 2018 a high degree of confidence in validation between cfd simulations and the towing tank tests was thus accomplished between motion and load responses a regular wave cfd model is set up to simulate the catamaran motion in headseas waves almallah et al 2019b a time record is selected from run 163 that has a wave profile close to a regular wave wave characteristics are identified from the 30 sec record the wave height is set to be 1 7 m and the encounter wave period is taken to be 3 75 s peak to peak in this cfd simulation to closely match the data since the sea trials were in random waves no attempt was made to match the phase of the incoming wave with that in the sea trials results in addition motion and load responses computed in regular cfd model was compared to experimental model scale towing tank tests to further validate the proposed cfd model in headseas motions and load cfd results are compared against geometrically dynamically and flexurally similar 1 40 scale model towing tank tests lavroff 2009 performed a wide range of regular wave towing tank tests on a 2 5 m incat catamaran model to investigate longitudinal bending moments in several wave conditions a tests was selected for validation which was performed at a dimensionless wave encounter frequency of 4 15 1 53 m s forward speed and 60 mm wave height fig 7 shows heave and pitch motion responses and predicted lbm of the full scale cfd run and towing tank run it can be seen that motion and load results have a high degree of agreement the largest deviation of about 8 was observed in the motion responses which could be due to uncertainties such as the difference in hull shape of the tested catamarans cfd simulations at model scale were investigated over the wide range of conditions of the towing tank tests a high degree of confidence in validation between cfd simulations and the towing tank tests was accomplished between motion and load responses viscous k omega turbulent rans viscous laminar and inviscid fluid flow cfd models were considered in regular and irregular waves to determine the best choice of modelling technique the inviscid flow assumption apply a simplified form of the navier stokes equations in which the viscosity can be neglected such flows might occur where the reynolds number r e u l v is high which is suitable in simulating motion of the high speed catamaran at full scale fig 8 shows a 20 sec sample of motion responses in irregular wave cfd simulations performed using inviscid and viscous turbulent models heave and pitch motion responses of those fluid flow full scale cfd simulation types are examined it is found that those motion responses have good degree of agreement with the towing tank runs the viscous turbulent cfd model provides a very close magnitude of motion responses to the inviscid flow cfd model as shown in fig 8 however the viscous laminar flow cfd model provides reduced magnitudes of motion responses compared with the other two inviscid flow is considered to be most efficient for simulating the full scale wave piercing catamaran wpc as it gave broadly comparable results to viscous turbulent model which is the more rational of the three methods but for 28 less cpu time the significantly higher cpu time for the viscous model is attributed to a combination of the increased number of variables and equations to solve and the mesh refinement required in the viscous model to capture the boundary layer around the hull this similarity is not surprising because of the very large characteristic lengths and the oscillatory nature of motion in waves the former means that the reynolds numbers is very large hence inertia effects of the water phase dominate over viscosity effects as well as over any effects in the air phase while the oscillatory motion means that wakes due to vertical motions do not fully develop and are continually suppressed by motion reversal as inviscid flow is selected and viscosity is neglected the fluid flow might neglect some motion damping components which would result in slightly higher rotational motion in addition the inviscid flow cfd model cannot be used in determination of resistance forces acting on the catamaran hull the vof and mesh settings of the current cfd model are next considered the default value of vof angle factor recommended by star ccm is 0 05 it was observed that it produces short wavelength wrinkles on the free surface in full scale cfd simulations however cfd runs show that the effect of these wrinkles is around 3 3 and 5 on the computed heave pitch motion and lbm load respectively nevertheless by using an angle factor of 0 2 it was found that the wrinkles are eliminated the mesh settings were also investigated the transverse aspect ratio of the domain mesh between y axis and z axis in the presented simulations is 8 it was found that on reducing this to 4 the change in the computed heave pitch motion and lbm load is around 2 1 and 1 respectively but with a significant solution time penalty refining the mesh vertically from the current 0 3125 m down to 0 2 m the solution time is more than doubled however it is found that the effect is around 3 1 and 4 on the computed heave pitch and lbm load respectively an inviscid irregular wave cfd model was set up to simulate a run with nominally the same wave condition and sailing time as sea trial run 163 the cfd simulation was undertaken at 20 knots in headseas running for 21 min of full scale ship travel fig 9 shows a 2d profile of the catamaran in irregular headseas the wall clock running time to complete this cfd simulation was 18 days using 28 cores at 2 1 ghz and 6 8 gb ram the significant wave height and peak wave period were reported by nswccd for the sea trials sea condition for run 163 as 2 59 m and 8 5 s respectively bachman 2004 these were measured from the stationary ship prior to commencing the octagon containing this run however as wave conditions vary both temporally and spatially these may be regarded as nominal values only and the waves measured during the actual run were used to derive a more applicable encounter spectrum which was then converted to a stationary wave spectrum the encounter wave spectrum is converted to stationary wave spectrum using equations 6 and 7 these equations account for the ship velocity v s and relative wave heading angle β from this the significant wave height and peak period corresponding to sea trials run 163 were obtained as 2 375 m and 11 63 s respectively then this stationary irregular wave characteristics are used in the cfd simulation wave inlet setup the default values of γ 3 3 and σ 0 09 for ω ω p or 0 07 for ω ω p are commonly used for jonswap spectra but actually apply only for fully developed seas and did not produce a spectrum that matched what was measured in response to this γ was reduced to match the maximum spectral density i e at ω ω p and σ was reduced and assumed constant for all ω to match the local width of the spectral peak apart from at very low frequency this gave a much better match to the measured spectrum and the moving wave spectrum during the run was matched using the tsk wave radar sea trials data table 2 lists the resulting parameters which were input into the cfd simulation and the comparison to the measured spectrum is discussed below 6 ω e ω 1 v s ω g cos β 7 s ω s e ω e 1 2 v s ω g cos β where ω is the wave frequency ω e is the encounter wave frequency β is the relative wave

for the cfd simulation left hand side of diagram with those from sea trial run 163 right hand side of diagram of course the time domain wave records are not expected to match in general since the generated waves are random following the general spectrum however here we have identified short samples of wave profile that look similar in both the cfd and sea trials results with the aim of then comparing the motions that result from this as seen in this figure there is good broad agreement of the magnitude of heave and pitch motion responses more generally the main aim of this simulation is to obtain a statistically comparable motion response compared to the sea trial over the whole run root mean square rms values for wave height pitch motion and heave acceleration are compared in fig 11 for cfd simulations and the sea trial run values for wave height and pitch angle are indicated on the left axis and heave acceleration on the right axis generally the range of the simulated pitch and heave motion is close to the sea trial records there is a deviation of 10 16 in the rms value for each signal fig 12 shows the spectral density of the cfd simulated wave elevation as a function of wave encounter frequency this is compared to the theoretical jonswap spectrum and also to the spectrum observed in the sea trials it is observed that the cfd simulation peak frequency and power magnitude line up well with the sea trial spectrum peak table 3 shows the significant wave height and peak wave period that were measured from wave records of the sea trial run and the achieved values in cfd simulation the deviation between those values is around 2 and 3 respectively which is due to the randomness of the simulated waves 4 global slam loads global loads are estimated from cfd hydrodynamic forces and body motions based on the rigid body dynamics formulation that was discussed in section 3 1 longitudinal bending moment lbm transverse bending moment tbm splitting force and prying moment are estimated for the entire time record of cfd simulation fig 13 shows a 2 min sample of the computed wave height motion responses and normalised global loads with rule design limit these results show two slam events identified by short duration peaks with very rapid rise and fall in the response signals most obvious in the pitch acceleration normalised lbm and prying moment signals at approximate times of 55 s and 60 s during slam events the global loads can increase to be substantially higher than the ordinary wave global loads it is important to estimate the slam load reliably to ensure that the catamaran structure can withstand it safely the longitudinal bending moment has been investigated previously during slam events through towing tank tests and cfd numerical simulations lavroff et al 2013 lavroff et al 2017 it is important to note that transverse bending moment split forces and prying moment are quantified in slam events using cfd simulations in addition to longitudinal bending moment the slam event peak is most clearly evident in the pitch acceleration since the hull rotation positive bow down quickly comes to a halt relative to the wave as the bow encounters the water surface it is observed that slam events occur when pitch acceleration decreases suddenly below 0 08 rad s2 based on the detection threshold of negative pitch acceleration exceeding 0 1 rad s2 slam events are counted in the full 21 min records of both the cfd simulation and the corresponding sea trial run in the sea trial runs the catamaran was intentionally operated in conditions designed to induce a large number of slamming events in order to assess its performance and operational limits the cfd simulation was shown to be capable of simulating similar slamming events as the sea trial run fig 14 shows the cumulative number of major slamming events counted in the sea trial and cfd simulation run as time progresses 14 major slams have been recorded from the sea trial and computed from the cfd simulation in the 21 min run the timing and rate of the slams within these runs differed because of the random nature of the wave form of the time domain wave elevation records longitudinal bending moment transverse bending moment split force and prying moment are computed during the cfd run and slamming events were identified by observing pitch acceleration records longitudinal bending moment lbm which is the most significant response over all of the recorded slam loads is estimated near midship by calculating the moment of pressure and inertial forces fig 15 a shows the box plot of normalised lbm over the 21 min of run time in the cfd simulation both sag positive and hog negative values have been included for the normalised lbm loads presented in fig 15 it is noted that the positive sag values are greater than the negative hog values it can be seen directly that the influence of the positive sag slam load on the lbm is similar to our observations in the catamaran model tests especially when comparing sag and hog normalised lbm slam load ranges from 0 13 to 0 37 during the majority of slamming events and reaches up to 0 66 in one severe slam event transverse bending moment tbm is also computed from the cfd simulation run tbm is estimated on the vessel centreline by taking the moment of pressure and inertia forces acting on the port half segment about the vertical centre of gravity as discussed in section 3 1 since roll motion is nil in pure headseas the values of the transverse bending moment depend solely on heave inertia forces and pressure forces acting on the hull fig 15 b shows the boxplot of the normalised transverse bending moment over the cfd simulation a positive tbm indicates hogging moment about the centre line of the catamaran the values of the normalised tbm slam load range from 0 17 to 0 19 and reach up to 0 28 in one severe slam event which are much lower than lbm as the transverse arm for moment calculation is smaller fig 15 c similarly shows the slam box plot of prying moment estimated from the cfd simulation prying moment is estimated by taking the moment of split forces about midship position further details below a positive prying moment indicates outward relative movement of the demihull bows the values of prying moment load range from 39 to 24 mn m in headseas and reach up to 65 mn m in one severe slam event split forces were computed at different longitudinal segments of one demihull of the catamaran it is evident that there is a longitudinal distribution of the split forces along the catamaran hull since the values obviously differ for each segment consequently this causes a longitudinal prying moment acting on the catamaran hull fig 16 shows a 30 s record of the computed split forces on aft and forward segments and the corresponding prying moment the aft segment is 31 m and the forward segment is 37 m as the catamaran moves through the headseas waves the sign of the split forces inverts from positive outward to negative inward along the hull the forward part of the demihull tends to curve inwards which affects also the split force direction on the demihull during bow entry 5 discussion the main aim of developing a cfd model is to provide realistic simulation of sea trials runs of a high speed catamaran hence to obtain a more reliable estimate of global loads acting on the hull at full scale than those provided by design rules or codes sea wave condition heading and ship speed recorded in sea trials are the main inputs to the cfd model which provides motion responses and rigid body global loads the estimated global loads involve slamming loads which are usually the critical load the determined loads are now compared with load limits defined by dnv gl 2015 high speed light craft hslc code rules fig 17 illustrates the distribution of longitudinal bending moment determined at sections near midship forward and aft locations the peak values of slam longitudinal bending moments are plotted against the dnv gl rule value which indicates that under the simulated conditions the load reached about 65 of the rule value in addition transverse bending moment tbm reaches 28 of the corresponding dnv gl rule limit total split forces are estimated from cfd simulation over the catamaran hull and it is noted that the peak load reaches 15 of the dnv gl rule limit for total split force prying moments estimated from cfd simulations have not been compared with code design limit since while the dnv gl rules provide design limits of shear force and bending and torsional moment they do not provide rules for the prying moment generally it is expected that there would be correlation between the wave specifications and the magnitude of the slam bending load to investigate this fig 18 shows the correlation between longitudinal bending moment slam load and instantaneous wave height prior to the slam event the upper envelope of the scatter plot is shown as it is important in defining a suitable design load the instantaneous wave height at the time of slam was estimated as peak to trough for each major slamming event it is seen that the instantaneous wave height has a proportional effect on the recorded slam induced lbm of course other factors would also affect the slam load such as encounter wave period ship speed and pitch orientation of the ship prior to slamming the highest pitch acceleration was recorded at each major slamming event and fig 19 presents the correlation between pitch acceleration and lbm due to slam loads for both the cfd and the sea trials in the case of the sea trial run records pitch acceleration is estimated for each slamming event of the sea trial run as before the strain load transformation matrix was applied to convert the strain signal into a longitudinal bending moment almallah et al 2019a it is evident that there is close to a linear relation between these variables this makes physical sense because as the catamaran hull hits the water surface harder the required deceleration of the motion will be higher hence slam forces are greater causing a higher longitudinal bending moment slam location is approximately constant at the bow and slam forces are large compared with the underlying wave force consequently a large force and long lever arm provides the largest term in the sum of moments about the y axis giving a strong correlation with pitch acceleration it is noted in fig 19 that the correlation between pitch acceleration and lbm due to slam loads from the sea trials is close to the cfd simulation therefore the application of cfd to simulate sea trials has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of slam induced global load magnitudes 6 conclusions computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation has been applied to study high speed catamaran motions and loads in full scale irregular headseas waves data from sea trial runs on 98 m incat catamaran hsv2 swift hull 061 were used to validate the cfd motion responses from the cfd simulations rigid body dynamics were used to determine the internal loads acting on the catamaran hull inviscid cfd combined with a rigid body dynamics formulation is found to be a reliable method to study motions and loads associated with high speed catamarans different flow types were investigated to confirm motion and load responses and the additional computational cost of a turbulent simulation was not efficient for this type of analysis the mesh and vof settings of the cfd model were investigated and verified to provide best load and motion results for the proposed full scale irregular sea waves cfd model the cfd simulation was validated on a broad basis against motion responses undertaken in full scale sea trials tests irregular wave cfd modelling was undertaken to realistically simulate a complete sea trial run for 21 min at a forward speed of 20 knots and 2 375 m significant wave height motion responses were compared with the sea trial run and show good agreement slamming events occurred and were recorded in the sea trial runs and were computed from the full scale cfd simulation slamming rates computed by the cfd simulation were shown to match very well the experimental values recorded during the sea trial run longitudinal bending moments lbm transverse bending moments tbm split forces and prying moments were estimated from pressure and inertia forces using rigid body dynamics lbm and tbm loads were compared with dnv gl rule limits and it was found that lbm reached only 65 of the design limit it was observed that tbm values reached 28 of design while split forces reached 15 of the rule design limit split forces were found to have a longitudinal distribution along the catamaran hull which causes the prying moment dnv gl provide no rule load requirement for prying moments which were also found to be of moderate magnitude correlation between longitudinal bending moment and wave and pitch acceleration were investigated to visualise their effect on slam loads it was found that wave height has a proportional relation with lbm slam loads pitch acceleration is found to have a linear relation with lbm due to slam loads the results from this study thus demonstrate the effective use of full scale cfd for the estimation of global loads in the head seas case for high speed wave piercing catamarans when compared directly to sea trials this establishes the basis for future cfd studies to be undertaken in particular for investigating the

20546,global loads acting on high speed wave piercing catamarans are investigated using computational fluid dynamics cfd catamaran vessels are subjected to load cases that are not present on mono hull vessels such as transverse bending moment pitch connecting moment and splitting force as the speed and size of a catamaran increases the severity of loads rises with slam induced effects full scale cfd simulation is undertaken to investigate the pressure distributions and resultant global loads acting on the 98 m incat wave piercer catamaran hsv2 swift validated against sea trial tests rigid body dynamics are then applied to estimate the internal loads at different sections of the vessel based on the relative hydrodynamic and inertial force distributions the estimated global loads are then checked according to dnv gl rules by comparing design load limits global loads are estimated for the 98 m incat hsv2 swift catamaran in headseas at a forward speed of 20 knots splitting forces are found to have a longitudinal distribution along the catamaran hull which causes prying moments peak values for lbm are examined relative to corresponding instantaneous wave height prior to the

of gravity 1 introduction during the design stage it is important that the designer has access to tools to predict the vessel s structural performance similar to monohull ships high speed wave piercing catamarans encounter several types of motions and loads from sea waves but pitch connecting moments splitting forces and prying moments induce additional structural effects on multihull vessels the magnitudes of these loads depend on wave heading angle wave height wave period and sailing speed cook et al 1999 motions and load responses were comprehensively investigated for monohull vessels in short crested irregular waves through both model and full scale tests jiao et al 2019 and camilleri et al 2018 motion and load values rise drastically as the sea state vessel speed and size increase classification rules need a basis to fully quantify the safety margin for new designs of large high speed vessels wang et al 2006 computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation is a powerful numerical tool that may be applied to determine vessel motion and sea loads in different sea conditions and heading angles mancini et al 2018 one of the important advantages of using cfd over model tests is that it is suitable for high speed applications because run lengths need not be limited by physical facilities high frequency waves involved with slamming loads can also be simulated through cfd cfd methods have been applied to a wide variety of marine vessel related topics for example the capabilities of different cfd tools were investigated in the prediction of the flow field around a multihull catamaran advancing in forward motion in still water broglia et al 2019 a numerical method has also been presented to solve aerodynamics of partial air cushion supported catamaran pacscat by combining 2 5d hydrodynamics of demihulls with simplified wave equation guo et al 2015 interference effects between demi hulls for a fast catamaran were investigated through cfd simulation and experimental data zaghi et al 2011 reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are the most widely used for turbulence modelling and have thus been shown to be a valid approach for seakeeping and resistance prediction the capability of an unsteady rans code was assessed to predict the seakeeping characteristics of a high speed multi hull ship in high sea states allowing for the inclusion of nonlinear effects castiglione et al 2011 najafi et al 2015 investigated the effect of an active transom interceptor in controlling unpleasant motion accelerations and resulting loads of high speed planing catamarans through numerical cfd rans simulation in addition the cfd method is widely used as an optimization tool to enhance hull design and estimate a ship s drag and resistance tezdogan et al 2015 haase et al 2016 bouscasse et al 2013 and he et al 2013 in relation to wave piercing catamarans the global and slamming loads have been investigated by lavroff et al 2017 and mcvicar et al 2016 who investigated wave impact loads on incat hull 64 a 112 m high speed wave piercing catamaran through full scale experimental work numerical simulation using both cfd and fea and model scale experiments the magnitude of the wave slamming loads and bending moments acting on a 112 m wave piercing catamaran were also investigated by shabani et al 2018 wave slam in random headseas on wave piercing catamarans was studied through model test on a 2 5 m of hydro elastic model davis et al 2017 and swidan et al 2017 alavimehr et al 2019 studied the influence of the control algorithms on the slamming kinematics water entry impulse and energy transfer forward speed and wave encounter frequency effects on slamming and whipping have been studied by mcvicar et al 2016 by using rans cfd to identify transient slam loads on a 112 m catamaran hydroelastic slam induced bending of wave piercing catamarans in head seas is then investigated through fluid structure interaction fsi cfd simulations at model scale mcvicar et al 2018 the estimation of slam loads acting on high speed wave piercing catamarans was conducted using one way fsi two way fsi and rigid cfd models comparison with experimental model scale results showed a high agreement of load estimation using fsi and internal forces calculated using a rigid body model in the research work previously undertaken it is noted that cfd work simulated motions and loads of model tests which were conducted in regular waves the current paper extends this to investigate full scale sea trials of a high speed wave piercing incat catamaran which were conducted in real irregular seas numerical cfd runs are undertaken to realistically simulate sea trials run of full scale high speed catamaran high speed catamaran global loads consist of longitudinal bending moment lbm transverse bending moment tbm pitch connecting moment pcm shear and splitting forces these loads are a function of many variables including the ship forward speed and heading relative to incident waves longitudinal bending moment is one of the main global loads occurring at all heading angles and is used as a central basis for determining the hull structural design records of wave elevation motion responses and strain gauges were collected from sea trial runs of hsv2 swift fig 1 as undertaken by the naval surface warfare centre carderock division nswccd these sea trials were undertaken in various sea conditions speeds and heading angles cfd simulation of the head sea runs in irregular seas at 20 knots are compared to study global loads prediction longitudinal bending moment lbm transverse bending moment tbm splitting forces and prying moments are evaluated for this cfd simulation using rigid body dynamics and compared to the sea trials results for the head seas case 2 hsv 2 swift incat catamaran hull 061 incat catamaran hsv 2 swift was built and commissioned in hobart australia in 2004 the main particulars of hsv 2 are presented in table 1 a large number of sea trials runs were performed by the nswccd near norway to extensively assess motion and structural responses of the vessel under a wide range of sea conditions the sea trials consisted of 157 runs each of duration 20 25 min grouped into 22 octagons each occurring at a specific sea state speed wave height and period each octagon consisted of 5 8 runs at different heading angles for octagons with five runs the three remaining sides of the octagon were assumed to be equivalent by symmetry accelerometers were fitted to record ship motions including roll pitch and yaw rates and vertical accelerations at the lcg of the vessel and bridge locations brady et al 2004 wind and wave environment were also monitored and recorded a tsurumi seiki co ltd tsk wave radar and accelerometer were installed on the centreline of the vessel at the bow of the ship to measure the height of the encountered wave and corresponding motion hsv 2 was fitted with a large number of strain gauges designed to pick up different responses these gauges were divided into 4 groups the first group was dedicated to primary global loads the second group of strain gauges was dedicated to stress concentration at specific locations around the ship the third group was dedicated to secondary loads such as wave impact in the forward region of the ship the fourth group was dedicated to strain responses at specific locations such as the aft ramp crane and helicopter deck 3 method the raw data from both the experimental and cfd approaches require processing to enable global loads to be determined for the experimental data strains are recorded which require conversion using a structural model to estimate the load magnitude required to induce them whereas in cfd the pressure distribution and hull motion acceleration are converted using a longitudinal mass distribution and rigid body dynamics catamaran global loads can be estimated by applying the load transfer matrix to strain gauge records from sea trials runs almallah et al 2019a and almallah et al 2020 essentially loads as defined by the classification society rules dnv gl are applied to the finite element model of the ship and the strains are determined at the locations of the relevant strain gauges on the actual ship with some redundancy a least squares fit is then applied to determine the static load case multipliers in terms of the measured strains this is then applied to the sea trials data to determine the global loads that are equivalent to the dynamic loads experienced in service catamaran global loads are also estimated through computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation wave characteristics in cfd are determined from sea trial reports and then applied in the cfd run using standard jonswap sea spectrum the resulting pressure distributions in the cfd are then applied to a rigid body dynamic model of the ship to determine the internal forces and moments at key cross sections taking into account the vessel mass distribution 3 1 rigid body dynamics the internal global loads are estimated through hydrodynamic pressure motion and inertia responses holloway et al 2003 the vertical longitudinal bending moment lbm is estimated by equation 1 as follows derived by summing moments of pressure motion and inertia forces about the selected section 1 m y m x x g g h x g p m h y i y p where h and p are heave and pitch acceleration at the centre of gravity cg respectively m x x g x g and i y are mass sectional properties of the forward segment g is the gravitational acceleration and m h y is the longitudinal hydrodynamic moment on the segment evaluated at the aft end of segment about the y axis positive directions of these terms are shown in fig 2 with the internal forces applying to the shaded section positive longitudinal bending moments lbm correspond to sagging moments and negative to hogging fig 2 shows the main forces and moments essential for calculation of internal bending moment at a specified section at distance x measured from the forward end of the catamaran the vertical transverse bending moment tbm is determined using a similar approach taking a longitudinal cut to form a port side segment at any distance y measured from the ship side as shown in fig 3 equation 2 as follows shows the summation of moments about the segment 2 m x m y y g g h y g r m h x i x r where m y y g y g and i x are mass sectional properties of the segment g is the gravitational acceleration r is roll angular acceleration and m h x is the transverse hydrodynamic moment on the segment evaluated at the centreline end of the segment about the x axis in addition split force and prying moment are estimated to investigate the lateral loading on the catamaran in headseas the total force in the y direction is measured at several segments on the demihull prying moment is estimated by summing moments of all split forces about the z axis at the catamaran midship fig 4 shows split forces on the inner demihulls in the y direction and prying moments estimated at the midship position 3 2 cfd modelling computational fluid dynamics cfd analyses are performed in this study using star ccm code v12 04 simulations are performed at full scale with conditions matching the conditions reported for the sea trial runs undertaken at 20 knots in order to investigate the prediction method of the internal global loads the volume of fluid vof method is used to divide the full fluid domain into two fluid phases air and water in each mesh cell a volume fraction α i of each phase is defined such that i 1 n α i 1 always for most cells α i will be 1 for one of the phases and 0 for the other but takes fractional values when the free surface passes through a cell the location of the free surface is defined by solving for α i in such cells the fluid model used in this cfd analysis is based on implicit unsteady flow equations with a multiphase segregated flow solver to capture the interface with the air domain since the main target of this study is to estimate global loads on the catamaran hull which arise mainly from the water pressures normal to the hull surfaces an inviscid fluid model is applied to reduce computational time this is justified as discussed in section 3 3 to follow for incompressible flows the averaged continuity equation and euler inviscid flow equation are written in tensor form and cartesian coordinates as follows 3 ρ t ρ v 0 4 ρ d v d t p ρ g where d v d t is time rate of change within the control volume moving with the fluid p is the pressure and ρ is the fluid density which is invariant within each phase but can vary in cells through which the free surface passes being ρ i 1 n α i ρ i where α i is the volume fraction of each phase cd adapco 2017 states that the solution solves transport equations of each phase for mass momentum and energy while all the phases have the same pressure field the eulerian averaging of the transport equations leads to additional interaction between the phases cd adapco 2017 describes the vof method as being well suited to simulating flows of several immiscible fluids on numerical grids capable of resolving the interface between the phases of the mixture it is an efficient model for flows in which each phase is a large continuous region the domain block size is set to allow the irregular waves to develop between inlet and outlet and the catamaran hull following guidelines of ittc ittc 2011 irregular waves are generated using jonswap sea spectrum fig 5 shows the cfd model adopted in this study with domain size the length of the domain block is set to 400 m width is 125 m and depth is 325 m the domain has a moving reference frame yz moving with the mean forward speed of the ship the domain width assures that the developed motions of the catamaran in waves are free from any significant reflections that might occur at the sides a wave monitor is placed 60 m from the inlet plane forward of the hull to record wave elevation before it is encountered by the hull wave damping is applied near the outlet boundary to minimise any wave reflection from the outlet surface back to the model in order to reduce cpu running time and computational requirements only half of the catamaran hull the port side is used a symmetry boundary condition is applied at the centreline of the catamaran along the domain side face in order to accurately simulate the other half of the model fig 5 shows that the velocity inlet boundary condition is set in the y z plane at the positive x domain extremity where irregular waves are generated the opposite y z plane was modelled as a pressure outlet the top and bottom boundaries are both specified as velocity inlets the side of the domain the positive y direction also has a velocity inlet boundary condition an overset mesh is used to facilitate motions of the full scale catamaran model this option allows the mesh around the ship model to translate and rotate with the catamaran within the bounds of the fixed mesh of the domain and the solution is interpolated between the two meshes the overset block is 145 m in length 30 m in width and 55 m in depth in order to simulate realistic full scale catamaran performance a dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi model is applied with two degrees of freedom heave and pitch the dfbi model enabled the solver to calculate the excitation force and moments acting on the catamaran due to hydrodynamic pressure in head waves an irregular wave model is chosen to simulate the sea trial runs that were undertaken in open sea water since the trials were conducted in the north sea a jonswap joint north sea wave project wave spectrum is selected to model headseas waves equation 5 shows the basic formulation of the jonswap sea wave spectrum cd adapco 2017 5 s ω 1 0 287 ln γ 5 16 h s 2 ω p 4 ω 5 e 5 4 ω p ω 4 γ e ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 2 where ω is the wave frequency ω p is the peak wave frequency σ is the spectral width parameter h s is the significant wave height γ is the non dimensional peak shape parameter the mesh is refined near the hull and with the exception of the free surface region element size is gradually increased towards the domain boundaries the free surface mesh is refined through the entire domain and only coarsened towards the outlet fig 6 shows the mesh for the fluid domain surrounding the catamaran hull the smallest vertical size of fluid mesh elements close to the hull was set to 0 3125 m and the largest elements in the mesh were 5 m the total number of cells in the mesh grid in the proposed cfd model is 1 54 106 cells the time step used was 0 01 s with 10 maximum inner iterations those values have been adopted in previous studies on similar ships and were found to give reasonable accuracy for estimation of global loads and motions in full scale and model scale simulations almallah et al 2019b mcvicar et al 2018 3 3 verification and validation of the cfd model several cfd simulation runs were undertaken in order to verify and validate the proposed full scale cfd model in this study since the global loads are motion induced it is important to ensure that the cfd analysis provides similar motion responses to the sea trial runs cfd simulations at model scale were previously investigated at a wide range of wave conditions during towing tank tests mcvicar et al 2018 a high degree of confidence in validation between cfd simulations and the towing tank tests was thus accomplished between motion and load responses a regular wave cfd model is set up to simulate the catamaran motion in headseas waves almallah et al 2019b a time record is selected from run 163 that has a wave profile close to a regular wave wave characteristics are identified from the 30 sec record the wave height is set to be 1 7 m and the encounter wave period is taken to be 3 75 s peak to peak in this cfd simulation to closely match the data since the sea trials were in random waves no attempt was made to match the phase of the incoming wave with that in the sea trials results in addition motion and load responses computed in regular cfd model was compared to experimental model scale towing tank tests to further validate the proposed cfd model in headseas motions and load cfd results are compared against geometrically dynamically and flexurally similar 1 40 scale model towing tank tests lavroff 2009 performed a wide range of regular wave towing tank tests on a 2 5 m incat catamaran model to investigate longitudinal bending moments in several wave conditions a tests was selected for validation which was performed at a dimensionless wave encounter frequency of 4 15 1 53 m s forward speed and 60 mm wave height fig 7 shows heave and pitch motion responses and predicted lbm of the full scale cfd run and towing tank run it can be seen that motion and load results have a high degree of agreement the largest deviation of about 8 was observed in the motion responses which could be due to uncertainties such as the difference in hull shape of the tested catamarans cfd simulations at model scale were investigated over the wide range of conditions of the towing tank tests a high degree of confidence in validation between cfd simulations and the towing tank tests was accomplished between motion and load responses viscous k omega turbulent rans viscous laminar and inviscid fluid flow cfd models were considered in regular and irregular waves to determine the best choice of modelling technique the inviscid flow assumption apply a simplified form of the navier stokes equations in which the viscosity can be neglected such flows might occur where the reynolds number r e u l v is high which is suitable in simulating motion of the high speed catamaran at full scale fig 8 shows a 20 sec sample of motion responses in irregular wave cfd simulations performed using inviscid and viscous turbulent models heave and pitch motion responses of those fluid flow full scale cfd simulation types are examined it is found that those motion responses have good degree of agreement with the towing tank runs the viscous turbulent cfd model provides a very close magnitude of motion responses to the inviscid flow cfd model as shown in fig 8 however the viscous laminar flow cfd model provides reduced magnitudes of motion responses compared with the other two inviscid flow is considered to be most efficient for simulating the full scale wave piercing catamaran wpc as it gave broadly comparable results to viscous turbulent model which is the more rational of the three methods but for 28 less cpu time the significantly higher cpu time for the viscous model is attributed to a combination of the increased number of variables and equations to solve and the mesh refinement required in the viscous model to capture the boundary layer around the hull this similarity is not surprising because of the very large characteristic lengths and the oscillatory nature of motion in waves the former means that the reynolds numbers is very large hence inertia effects of the water phase dominate over viscosity effects as well as over any effects in the air phase while the oscillatory motion means that wakes due to vertical motions do not fully develop and are continually suppressed by motion reversal as inviscid flow is selected and viscosity is neglected the fluid flow might neglect some motion damping components which would result in slightly higher rotational motion in addition the inviscid flow cfd model cannot be used in determination of resistance forces acting on the catamaran hull the vof and mesh settings of the current cfd model are next considered the default value of vof angle factor recommended by star ccm is 0 05 it was observed that it produces short wavelength wrinkles on the free surface in full scale cfd simulations however cfd runs show that the effect of these wrinkles is around 3 3 and 5 on the computed heave pitch motion and lbm load respectively nevertheless by using an angle factor of 0 2 it was found that the wrinkles are eliminated the mesh settings were also investigated the transverse aspect ratio of the domain mesh between y axis and z axis in the presented simulations is 8 it was found that on reducing this to 4 the change in the computed heave pitch motion and lbm load is around 2 1 and 1 respectively but with a significant solution time penalty refining the mesh vertically from the current 0 3125 m down to 0 2 m the solution time is more than doubled however it is found that the effect is around 3 1 and 4 on the computed heave pitch and lbm load respectively an inviscid irregular wave cfd model was set up to simulate a run with nominally the same wave condition and sailing time as sea trial run 163 the cfd simulation was undertaken at 20 knots in headseas running for 21 min of full scale ship travel fig 9 shows a 2d profile of the catamaran in irregular headseas the wall clock running time to complete this cfd simulation was 18 days using 28 cores at 2 1 ghz and 6 8 gb ram the significant wave height and peak wave period were reported by nswccd for the sea trials sea condition for run 163 as 2 59 m and 8 5 s respectively bachman 2004 these were measured from the stationary ship prior to commencing the octagon containing this run however as wave conditions vary both temporally and spatially these may be regarded as nominal values only and the waves measured during the actual run were used to derive a more applicable encounter spectrum which was then converted to a stationary wave spectrum the encounter wave spectrum is converted to stationary wave spectrum using equations 6 and 7 these equations account for the ship velocity v s and relative wave heading angle β from this the significant wave height and peak period corresponding to sea trials run 163 were obtained as 2 375 m and 11 63 s respectively then this stationary irregular wave characteristics are used in the cfd simulation wave inlet setup the default values of γ 3 3 and σ 0 09 for ω ω p or 0 07 for ω ω p are commonly used for jonswap spectra but actually apply only for fully developed seas and did not produce a spectrum that matched what was measured in response to this γ was reduced to match the maximum spectral density i e at ω ω p and σ was reduced and assumed constant for all ω to match the local width of the spectral peak apart from at very low frequency this gave a much better match to the measured spectrum and the moving wave spectrum during the run was matched using the tsk wave radar sea trials data table 2 lists the resulting parameters which were input into the cfd simulation and the comparison to the measured spectrum is discussed below 6 ω e ω 1 v s ω g cos β 7 s ω s e ω e 1 2 v s ω g cos β where ω is the wave frequency ω e is the encounter wave frequency β is the relative wave

for the cfd simulation left hand side of diagram with those from sea trial run 163 right hand side of diagram of course the time domain wave records are not expected to match in general since the generated waves are random following the general spectrum however here we have identified short samples of wave profile that look similar in both the cfd and sea trials results with the aim of then comparing the motions that result from this as seen in this figure there is good broad agreement of the magnitude of heave and pitch motion responses more generally the main aim of this simulation is to obtain a statistically comparable motion response compared to the sea trial over the whole run root mean square rms values for wave height pitch motion and heave acceleration are compared in fig 11 for cfd simulations and the sea trial run values for wave height and pitch angle are indicated on the left axis and heave acceleration on the right axis generally the range of the simulated pitch and heave motion is close to the sea trial records there is a deviation of 10 16 in the rms value for each signal fig 12 shows the spectral density of the cfd simulated wave elevation as a function of wave encounter frequency this is compared to the theoretical jonswap spectrum and also to the spectrum observed in the sea trials it is observed that the cfd simulation peak frequency and power magnitude line up well with the sea trial spectrum peak table 3 shows the significant wave height and peak wave period that were measured from wave records of the sea trial run and the achieved values in cfd simulation the deviation between those values is around 2 and 3 respectively which is due to the randomness of the simulated waves 4 global slam loads global loads are estimated from cfd hydrodynamic forces and body motions based on the rigid body dynamics formulation that was discussed in section 3 1 longitudinal bending moment lbm transverse bending moment tbm splitting force and prying moment are estimated for the entire time record of cfd simulation fig 13 shows a 2 min sample of the computed wave height motion responses and normalised global loads with rule design limit these results show two slam events identified by short duration peaks with very rapid rise and fall in the response signals most obvious in the pitch acceleration normalised lbm and prying moment signals at approximate times of 55 s and 60 s during slam events the global loads can increase to be substantially higher than the ordinary wave global loads it is important to estimate the slam load reliably to ensure that the catamaran structure can withstand it safely the longitudinal bending moment has been investigated previously during slam events through towing tank tests and cfd numerical simulations lavroff et al 2013 lavroff et al 2017 it is important to note that transverse bending moment split forces and prying moment are quantified in slam events using cfd simulations in addition to longitudinal bending moment the slam event peak is most clearly evident in the pitch acceleration since the hull rotation positive bow down quickly comes to a halt relative to the wave as the bow encounters the water surface it is observed that slam events occur when pitch acceleration decreases suddenly below 0 08 rad s2 based on the detection threshold of negative pitch acceleration exceeding 0 1 rad s2 slam events are counted in the full 21 min records of both the cfd simulation and the corresponding sea trial run in the sea trial runs the catamaran was intentionally operated in conditions designed to induce a large number of slamming events in order to assess its performance and operational limits the cfd simulation was shown to be capable of simulating similar slamming events as the sea trial run fig 14 shows the cumulative number of major slamming events counted in the sea trial and cfd simulation run as time progresses 14 major slams have been recorded from the sea trial and computed from the cfd simulation in the 21 min run the timing and rate of the slams within these runs differed because of the random nature of the wave form of the time domain wave elevation records longitudinal bending moment transverse bending moment split force and prying moment are computed during the cfd run and slamming events were identified by observing pitch acceleration records longitudinal bending moment lbm which is the most significant response over all of the recorded slam loads is estimated near midship by calculating the moment of pressure and inertial forces fig 15 a shows the box plot of normalised lbm over the 21 min of run time in the cfd simulation both sag positive and hog negative values have been included for the normalised lbm loads presented in fig 15 it is noted that the positive sag values are greater than the negative hog values it can be seen directly that the influence of the positive sag slam load on the lbm is similar to our observations in the catamaran model tests especially when comparing sag and hog normalised lbm slam load ranges from 0 13 to 0 37 during the majority of slamming events and reaches up to 0 66 in one severe slam event transverse bending moment tbm is also computed from the cfd simulation run tbm is estimated on the vessel centreline by taking the moment of pressure and inertia forces acting on the port half segment about the vertical centre of gravity as discussed in section 3 1 since roll motion is nil in pure headseas the values of the transverse bending moment depend solely on heave inertia forces and pressure forces acting on the hull fig 15 b shows the boxplot of the normalised transverse bending moment over the cfd simulation a positive tbm indicates hogging moment about the centre line of the catamaran the values of the normalised tbm slam load range from 0 17 to 0 19 and reach up to 0 28 in one severe slam event which are much lower than lbm as the transverse arm for moment calculation is smaller fig 15 c similarly shows the slam box plot of prying moment estimated from the cfd simulation prying moment is estimated by taking the moment of split forces about midship position further details below a positive prying moment indicates outward relative movement of the demihull bows the values of prying moment load range from 39 to 24 mn m in headseas and reach up to 65 mn m in one severe slam event split forces were computed at different longitudinal segments of one demihull of the catamaran it is evident that there is a longitudinal distribution of the split forces along the catamaran hull since the values obviously differ for each segment consequently this causes a longitudinal prying moment acting on the catamaran hull fig 16 shows a 30 s record of the computed split forces on aft and forward segments and the corresponding prying moment the aft segment is 31 m and the forward segment is 37 m as the catamaran moves through the headseas waves the sign of the split forces inverts from positive outward to negative inward along the hull the forward part of the demihull tends to curve inwards which affects also the split force direction on the demihull during bow entry 5 discussion the main aim of developing a cfd model is to provide realistic simulation of sea trials runs of a high speed catamaran hence to obtain a more reliable estimate of global loads acting on the hull at full scale than those provided by design rules or codes sea wave condition heading and ship speed recorded in sea trials are the main inputs to the cfd model which provides motion responses and rigid body global loads the estimated global loads involve slamming loads which are usually the critical load the determined loads are now compared with load limits defined by dnv gl 2015 high speed light craft hslc code rules fig 17 illustrates the distribution of longitudinal bending moment determined at sections near midship forward and aft locations the peak values of slam longitudinal bending moments are plotted against the dnv gl rule value which indicates that under the simulated conditions the load reached about 65 of the rule value in addition transverse bending moment tbm reaches 28 of the corresponding dnv gl rule limit total split forces are estimated from cfd simulation over the catamaran hull and it is noted that the peak load reaches 15 of the dnv gl rule limit for total split force prying moments estimated from cfd simulations have not been compared with code design limit since while the dnv gl rules provide design limits of shear force and bending and torsional moment they do not provide rules for the prying moment generally it is expected that there would be correlation between the wave specifications and the magnitude of the slam bending load to investigate this fig 18 shows the correlation between longitudinal bending moment slam load and instantaneous wave height prior to the slam event the upper envelope of the scatter plot is shown as it is important in defining a suitable design load the instantaneous wave height at the time of slam was estimated as peak to trough for each major slamming event it is seen that the instantaneous wave height has a proportional effect on the recorded slam induced lbm of course other factors would also affect the slam load such as encounter wave period ship speed and pitch orientation of the ship prior to slamming the highest pitch acceleration was recorded at each major slamming event and fig 19 presents the correlation between pitch acceleration and lbm due to slam loads for both the cfd and the sea trials in the case of the sea trial run records pitch acceleration is estimated for each slamming event of the sea trial run as before the strain load transformation matrix was applied to convert the strain signal into a longitudinal bending moment almallah et al 2019a it is evident that there is close to a linear relation between these variables this makes physical sense because as the catamaran hull hits the water surface harder the required deceleration of the motion will be higher hence slam forces are greater causing a higher longitudinal bending moment slam location is approximately constant at the bow and slam forces are large compared with the underlying wave force consequently a large force and long lever arm provides the largest term in the sum of moments about the y axis giving a strong correlation with pitch acceleration it is noted in fig 19 that the correlation between pitch acceleration and lbm due to slam loads from the sea trials is close to the cfd simulation therefore the application of cfd to simulate sea trials has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of slam induced global load magnitudes 6 conclusions computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation has been applied to study high speed catamaran motions and loads in full scale irregular headseas waves data from sea trial runs on 98 m incat catamaran hsv2 swift hull 061 were used to validate the cfd motion responses from the cfd simulations rigid body dynamics were used to determine the internal loads acting on the catamaran hull inviscid cfd combined with a rigid body dynamics formulation is found to be a reliable method to study motions and loads associated with high speed catamarans different flow types were investigated to confirm motion and load responses and the additional computational cost of a turbulent simulation was not efficient for this type of analysis the mesh and vof settings of the cfd model were investigated and verified to provide best load and motion results for the proposed full scale irregular sea waves cfd model the cfd simulation was validated on a broad basis against motion responses undertaken in full scale sea trials tests irregular wave cfd modelling was undertaken to realistically simulate a complete sea trial run for 21 min at a forward speed of 20 knots and 2 375 m significant wave height motion responses were compared with the sea trial run and show good agreement slamming events occurred and were recorded in the sea trial runs and were computed from the full scale cfd simulation slamming rates computed by the cfd simulation were shown to match very well the experimental values recorded during the sea trial run longitudinal bending moments lbm transverse bending moments tbm split forces and prying moments were estimated from pressure and inertia forces using rigid body dynamics lbm and tbm loads were compared with dnv gl rule limits and it was found that lbm reached only 65 of the design limit it was observed that tbm values reached 28 of design while split forces reached 15 of the rule design limit split forces were found to have a longitudinal distribution along the catamaran hull which causes the prying moment dnv gl provide no rule load requirement for prying moments which were also found to be of moderate magnitude correlation between longitudinal bending moment and wave and pitch acceleration were investigated to visualise their effect on slam loads it was found that wave height has a proportional relation with lbm slam loads pitch acceleration is found to have a linear relation with lbm due to slam loads the results from this study thus demonstrate the effective use of full scale cfd for the estimation of global loads in the head seas case for high speed wave piercing catamarans when compared directly to sea trials this establishes the basis for future cfd studies to be undertaken in particular for investigating the

20547,tank sloshing is a hotspot issue in the design of a vessel the liquid in a partially filled tank sloshes along with the ship except the negative effects to the stability of the ship the sloshing phenomena may damage the wall of the tank due to the attacking pressure therefore the control of the tank sloshing is one of the researches emphasizes while the baffles in tanks have positive effect on the control of the tank sloshing so we compare influence of different baffle factors such as the number of baffles the liquid rate excitation frequency then compare the effect by investigating the wave height spectrum hydrodynamic force and the velocity vector the simulation processes are executed in star ccm in the numerical simulation of the tank sloshing we obtained a deformation at the peak of the wave height by adjusting the factors in the k ε model which is more approximate to the experimental results moreover in order to obtain the wave height through the direct measurement of the liquid height we derive the relationship between the liquid height and the wave height finally we proposed an unequal baffle height ubh allocation scheme then compared the performance of ubh scheme with the equal baffle height ebh scheme which has the same baffle number under the condition that the total height of all baffles is the same the performance of different baffle height allocation schemes are compared by setting different baffle height gradient numerical simulation results showed that the allocation of the baffle height has effect on the control of tank sloshing the ubh scheme with the proper baffle height gradient performs better than the ebh scheme when we take no account of the baffle strength keywords liquid sloshing vertical baffle numerical simulation hydrodynamic force 1 introduction as the scale of the lng become larger and larger the size of lng tanks increases with it the partially filled tank sloshes when the hull shakes under the excitation of the wave it is known well that the hydrodynamic load exerted by liquid sloshing can cause severe structural damage marco 2006 moreover if the excitation frequency is close to the natural frequency of the liquid in tanks a violent oscillation may occur due to the resonance which brings large impulse load to the tank wall changwen et al 2019 meanwhile the generating set of the lng is under working condition the liquid height in the tank changes dynamically this dynamic change of the liquid will change the natural frequency of the liquid in tank the probability of the occurrence of the resonance will increase then the dynamic hydrodynamic force on the tank wall will increase instantaneously therefore the analysis of the impulse load in tank and the control of tank sloshing is needing to be settled the tank sloshing phenomena mainly influenced by the size of the tank the liquid height the excitation frequency and the anti sloshing set lamb 1932 the intensity measurement of the tank sloshing usually realized by the investigation of the hydrodynamic force on the wall the free surface status wave height velocity resonance and so on xiang 2008 generally there are four types waves in tank including standing waves traveling waves hydraulic jump and vortex when we investigate the sloshing status in tanks meng 2008 and there are two types pressure causes by the sloshing we can find on the wall it can be divided in pulsating pressure and non pulse pressure the pulsating pressure is the local high pressure which continues a short time the non pulse pressure is the familiar dynamic pressure which changes relatively the analyze method includes theoretically analysis numerical simulation and experiment research the experiment result is the most accurate but it cost a lot of manpower and material resource at present the experiment researchers mainly aim at rectangular tank and the filling liquid is usually the water fujino et al used shaking table experiments to study the vibration of a single degree of freedom structure with an attached tuned liquid damper tld fujino et al 1992 min luo et al experimentally investigated the three dimensional sloshing in a membrane type lng liquefied natural gas tank under combined roll and pitch excitations in 2020 min et al 2020 saravanan et al carried out a series of experiments with different base aspect ratios length to width of tank different water depths wide range of excitation amplitudes and frequencies in order to investigate the nonlinear shallow water sloshing in detail saravanan and deepak 2020 to realize the numerical simulation of the tank sloshing phenomena many models and methods have been proposed with different emphasizes choun and yun used the linear water wave theory to study the sloshing characteristics of the fluid in a rectangular tank choun and yun 1996 generally the numerical simulation of the turbulence includes direct numerical simulation dns and indirect numerical simulation les method statistical average method and rans dongming liu adopted the large eddy simulation les approach to model the turbulence effect in sloshing tanks by using the smagorinsky sub grid scale sgs closure model dongming and pengzhi 2008 s brizzolara et al studied sloshing loads in partially filled tanks with rans method brizzolara et al 2011 dongxi liu et al proposed a new hybrid rans les approach to improve the predictive accuracy of rans and the computational efficiency of les the performances of present hybrid method are similar with that of the classical les model which can provide very accurate solutions dongxi et al 2017 jianjian xin et al investigated large amplitude sloshing in a prismatic tank with or without a baffle by a cartesian grid based three dimensional 3d multiphase flow model in this model an improved ghost cell method with a unified reconstruction scheme is developed to enforce boundary conditions on the slope walls of the tank jianjian et al 2020 bageerathan carried out the numerical investigation of sloshing in tank with hoariert baffles under resonant excitation using cfd code and compare the result with an experiment in 2021 bageerathan and thundil 2021 in this paper we analyze the sloshing by numerical simulation and compare the result with the experiment to demonstrate the feasibility of the numerical model then we simulate the sloshing in tanks with the baffles on the basis of the numerical model which has been demonstrated the investigation of the free surface is of great importance in tank sloshing the existed method to track the moving surface can be divided into two types front capturing and front tracking the front capturing includes wave transport volume of fluid level set and so on the front tracking includes dynamic mash mac wave height function and so on saravanan and deepak 2020 mac and vof methods are widely used while tracking the free surface in sloshing tanks vof method was proposed by hirt in 1981 the core is the introducing of the volume fraction f the key technology to track the free surface is the calculation of the changing volume fraction and the reconstruction of the free surface hirt and nichols 1981 due to the dangerous caused by the tank sloshing many methods against the sloshing have been proposed for example adding baffles flotage hasheminejad and mohammadi 2016 flexible absorbers gradinscak et al 2011 controlling the liquid carrier rate and subdividing the tank mitra et al 2010 panigrahy et al 2009 showed experimentally that baffles in a tank decrease the sloshing effect considerably because sharp edged baffles create turbulence in the flow field thereby dissipating the excess kinetic energy to the walls panigrahy et al 2009 adding the baffles in the tank can restrain the sloshing phenomena significantly therefore the baffles interest many researchers they payed attentions on the type number height poriness and the position of the baffles akyildiz 2012 and jung et al 2012 observed that increasing the submergence depths of vertical baffles may enhance liquid sloshing suppression akyildiz 2012 goudarzi and sabbagh yazdi 2012 carried out the experimental measurements to evaluate the efficiency of three types of baffles upper and lower mounted vertical baffles as well as horizontal baffles on hydrodynamic damping of the liquid motion goudarzi and sabbagh yazdi 2012 ebrahimian et al presented a developed successive method to determine sloshing natural frequencies for multi baffled axisymmetric containers with arbitrary geometries confirming that the baffle position on sloshing natural frequencies was more important than the baffle size in their study multi baffles were only represented by ring baffles ebrahimian et al 2013 chu et al studied the sloshing phenomenon in a rectangular water tank with multiple bottom mounted baffles indicating that the natural frequency of the tank can be altered by the multiple baffles and be related to the effective water depth above the baffles and yet only vertical baffles were considered chu et al 2018 there are also many other researches which focus on the anti sloshing device such as the baffles the vertical baffles equipped on the top or the bottom of the tank can alleviate the sloshing in tanks effectively many researches about the vertical baffles have been raised by numerical or experimental methods j h jung et al simulated the liquid sloshing in tank with vertical baffles by numerical methods he set the baffle height the liquid height as the variable and investigated the hydrodynamic force surface elevation velocity vector profile in the tank to compare the effect of the baffles jung et al 2012 hao q et al study the effect of horizontal and vertical baffle position then investigate the hydrodynamic force wave height to demonstrate the baffle position act differently on the sloshing phenomena in 2019 hao et al 2019 liting yu focused on the relative position of the baffles to compare the effect on the sloshing phenomena in 2020 liting et al 2020 furthermore porous baffle is also a research hotspot i h cho et al study the porous vertical elastic baffles with experiment in 2016 this paper compared different baffle position porosity submerged depth cho 2020 arun george also demonstrated the effect of the porous baffles with experiments in 2020 arun and cho 2020 moreover there are many scholars have study other baffle form such as horizontal baffle t shaped baffle wang w et al learned the effect of the t shaped and y shaped baffles in 2016 wenyuan et al 2016 and ugur oral et al learned the effect of the t shaped baffle in 2019 uğur et al 2019 they demonstrated the inhibiting effect of the baffles on the sloshing mohammad reza shekari studied the ring baffle in a steel cylindrical tank and summarized the installation of baffle rings inside the liquid tank can diminish the dynamic response during severe earthquake significantly in 2020 mohammad 2020 from the related works above we can find that the unequal allocation of the baffle height haven t been tried yet and part of scholars investigated the surface elevation while parts of them investigated the wave height to estimate the sloshing of the tanks but none of them pay attention to the relationship between the factors such as surface elevation displacement and wave height therefore this paper simulated the tank sloshing with baffles on the basis of the experiment in chiaren et al 2018 the simulation result shows that the wave height in the different position the same height is different so we proposed an unequal allocation of baffle height in this paper the main contribution of the paper can be listed as follows 1 a lesser amount of computation compared to the les method the high reynolds number in core region and the low reynolds number in near wall region k ε model will reduce 40 computing time under the similar error rate 2 more accurate simulation at the turning of the wave which means the phase at 90 and 270 from the experiment result we could find that the surface elevation is not completely conform to the sinusoidal function it has a little deformation at the peak of the wave because the actual wall is not completely smooth the viscosity of the wall and the liquid will result in a little resistance in the process of the sloshing so the rise and the fall at the wall will be alleviate in this paper a low reynolds number k ε model is used for the near wall region and the liquid viscosity and wall roughness can be set to simulate the deformation trend at the peak 3 the derivation of the relationship between the liquid height and the wave height the surface elevation is consisted of the vertical tank displacement and the wave height however the investigation just obtained the surface elevation rather than the wave height in this paper we derived the relationship between the surface elevation and the wave height through the geometric calculation of the sloshing tank 4 the unequal allocation scheme of the baffle height and the analysis of its effects on the tank sloshing in the process of the tank sloshing the wave height is different in the different position so in this paper we propose an unequal baffle height allocation scheme and the five baffle of same height model is simulated as a contrast scheme we compared two types of allocation the baffle height increases or decreases from the sides to the center meanwhile the different rates of changing have been set to investigate the effect on the tank sloshing the simulation results showed that the performance of the ubh scheme with proper baffle height gradient is better than the ebh scheme while taking the baffle strength into concern the ubh scheme which baffle height increases from the sides to the center has more practical significance 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equation the flow of fluid is governed by the conservation laws the basic laws of conservation include the conservation of mass the conservation of momentum and the conservation of energy if the flow is in a turbulent state the system must comply with turbulent transport equations in addition the governing equations are the mathematical descriptions of these conservation laws the flow must satisfy the conservation of mass that is the mass increase in a fluid cell per unit time is equal to the net mass flowing into the cell in the same time interval according to this law the mass conservation equation can be described as follows 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 where t represents the time u is the velocity ρ is the density of the liquid i represent the direction x i is the coordinate on the i direction the flow must satisfy the conservation of momentum that is the changing rate of the momentum in a fluid cell is equal to the sum of various external forces acting on this cell according to this law the momentum conservation equation which is also known as n s equation can be described as follows 2 t ρ u i x i ρ u i u j p x i τ i j x i ρ g i f i where p is the pressure g is the gravitational acceleration τ i j is the stress vector f i is the other energy item the equations will be solved by star ccm using the finite volume method the widely used standard k ε model was adopted in this paper which is proposed by lauder and spalding in 1972 the model is consisted with the equations of turbulence energy k and turbulence dissipation rate ε 3 ρ k t ρ k u i x i x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k ρ ε 4 ρ ε t ρ ε u i x i x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j c 1 ε k g k c 2 ε ρ ε 2 k where μ is the laminar viscosity coefficient μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε is the turbulent viscosity coefficient g k is the generation term of turbulence energy k due to the average velocity gradient the calculation formular is subscribed below 5 g k μ t u i x j u j x i u i x j according to the recommended values of launder et al and subsequent experimental verification the model constant values are as follows c 1 ε 1 44 c 2 ε 1 92 c μ 0 09 σ k 1 0 σ ε 1 3 however the standard k ε model is not applicable in whole fluid region experimental studies have shown that for a fully developed turbulent flow with solid walls the fluid region can be divided into wall region viscous bottom layer transition layer logarithmic layer and core region according to the normal direction from the wall the standard k ε model which is the high reynolds number model is only suitable for the core region where turbulence is fully developed for the flow near the wall the reynolds number is low and the turbulence is not fully developed therefore it is necessary to use the low reynolds number k ε model to solve the calculation problem at the region where viscosity has a great effect in order to apply the low reynolds number k ε model in the near wall region properly we refined the mesh near the wall a mesh is thinner when it is closer to the wall the mesh zone of the model is shown in fig 1 in addition all y wall treatment in star ccm is adopted this treatment uses a blended wall function that can describe the velocity and turbulence in the three boundary layers viscous sublayer buffer layer and log layer arun and cho 2020 it can automatically calculate the y value according to the incoming flow velocity and the boundary grid and automatically switch the wall algorithm then the low reynolds number k ε model can be described as follows 6 ρ k t ρ k u i x i x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k ρ ε 2 μ k 1 2 n 2 7 ρ ε t ρ k u i x i x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j c 1 ε k g k f 1 c 2 ε ρ ε k f 2 2 μ μ t ρ 2 u n 2 2 where n represents the normal coordinates of the wall u is the velocity parallel with the wall μ t is the turbulent viscosity coefficient which can be calculated as follows 8 μ t c μ f μ ρ k 2 ε the coefficients different from the standard k ε model are calculated as follows 9 f 1 1 0 10 f 2 1 0 0 3 e r e t 2 11 f μ e 2 5 1 r e t 50 12 r e t ρ k 2 η ε obviously while the turbulence reynolds number r e t is high enough the values of f 1 f 2 and f μ are close to 1 0 and formula 6 7 is turn to the standard k ε model equation 3 4 2 2 free surface the surface tracking in this paper is realized by volume of fluid vof method zhenbing 2011 the basic idea of the vof method is introducing a fluid volume fraction f which is a step function the different values represent the composition of each phase in the unit meng 2008 here the fluid volume fraction f that is the volume fraction of liquid in the unit can be defined as 13 f ρ ρ a ρ w ρ a where ρ represents the average density of the fluid domain ρ a is the density of the air ρ w is the density of the water when f 1 the unit is filled with liquid when f 0 the unit is filled with air the f of the unit near the liquid air interface is between 0 and 1 the gradient of f can be used to determine the normal direction of the interface after the value of each unit and the gradient are obtained the approximate position of the free surface can be determined in each unit combining equations 1 and 13 the governing equation of f can be obtained as 14 f t u i f x i 0 2 3 excitation in order to simulate the tank sloshing it is necessary to bring an external rolling sinusoidal excitation to the tank artificially if the external excitation frequency is near the natural frequency of the liquid in the tank it is easy to cause resonance and make the sloshing process very violent therefore it is necessary to estimate the natural frequency of the liquid in the tank as a reference the estimation formula of the natural frequency f n of the liquid in the rectangular tank is calculated as follows ibrahim 2005 15 ω n 2 g k m t a n h k m h w 16 f n ω n 2 π 1 2 π g k m t a n h k m h w 17 k m 2 m 1 π l where h w is the height of the liquid l is the characteristic length on the sloshing direction m 1 2 3 is the mode of the natural frequency in this paper the excitation to the tank can be expressed as follows 18 f a e ω 2 s i n ω t π 2 where a e is the amplitude of the external excitation the angular frequency ω 2 π f e f e is the excitation frequency the external rolling excitation ω 2 π f e is given by the experiments in literature arun and cho 2020 in the literature the amplitude of excitation is given as 15 mm according to formula 18 the excitation is given in form of force which is in direct proportion to the accelerated speed the speed of rotation is the integration of the accelerated speed and the roll amplitude is the integration of the speed of rotation which unit is radian 2 4 the ubh unequal baffle height scheme and the different gradient k through the preliminary simulation of the tank sloshing with five baffles the observation and analysis of the wave height are carried out at different positions on the surface and the results are shown in fig 2 it can be seen that the sloshing amplitude of the liquid at the different positions in the tank is different it is caused by the combined effect of the wall and the external excitation therefore we will propose an ubh scheme to suppress the sloshing more effective a tank with 5 baffles is established as an example and the distribution of baffles is shown in fig 3 5 baffles are distributed symmetrically about the middle baffle y1 y2 y3 are the height of the baffles respectively ①②③④⑤ is the serial number of the baffles baffle ① is set as the y axis and the bilge is set as the x axis to establish a coordinate system the angle between the horizontal plane and the connecting line from the top of baffle ① to baffle ③ is θ therefore the value of the gradient k is t a n θ the interval between two adjacent baffles is 83 3 mm and the relationship among the baffle height is 19 y 2 y 1 83 3 k y 3 y 1 166 7 k taking 5 baffles with a height of 40 mm as a comparison the total height of the 5 baffles should be 200 mm 20 y 1 y 1 83 3 k 2 y 1 166 7 k 200 the value range of gradient k can be obtained by setting the extreme heights of baffle ① and baffle ③ when the baffle height increases from the sides to the center the range of k is 0 k 0 6 when the baffle height decreases from the sides to the center the value range of k value is 0 4 k 0 the case of k 0 means the baffle height is equal therefore when the gradient k is positive the values are set as 0 1 0 3 0 45 and 0 6 respectively for comparison when the gradient k is negative the values are set as 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 as comparison for example when k 0 3 the heights of baffles are 20 mm 45 mm 70 mm 45 mm and 20 mm respectively 2 5 the relationship between the liquid height and the wave height in the process of tank sloshing the liquid height and the wave height in the tank are not the same concept fig 4 shows a schematic diagram of the tank rolling to a certain angle with the center of the bilge as the center of rotation it can be seen from the figure that the liquid height in the tank at x is h and h w is the actual wave height here meanwhile the angle between the bilge and the equilibrium position is θ and the wave height in the tank can be calculated from the measured liquid height which can also use to judge whether the liquid in the tank touches the roof the relationship is derived as follows 21 h w c o s θ h x t a n θ in addition when the liquid mass in the tank is m the tank sloshing angle θ at t 0 can be obtained by integrating the external excitation function 22 θ 0 t 0 a e ω 2 s i n ω t π 2 m d t d t the initial value of θ is 0 and the sign of the value represents the rolling direction of the tank the positive sign represents the tank rolling to the left and the negative sign represents the tank rolling to the right 3 model validation this paper uses the k ε model to simulate the sloshing process in a rectangular tank the low reynolds number k ε model is used in the region near the wall where turbulence is not fully developed and the standard k ε model is used in the core region the free surface is captured by the vof method the fluid motion is solved by the continuity equation and the n s equation in this paper the middle section of the tank established based on the experimental model is shown in fig 5 the size of the tank is 500 300 200 mm the baffle height is 40 mm and its thickness is 5 mm therefore when the filling height is 80 mm the natural frequency f n of the liquid in the tank is 0 85 hz according to formula 16 in order to prove the validity of the model the numerical simulation results in this paper will be compared with the experimental results in the literature arun and cho 2020 and the simulation results of the les method we compared the measured height of the wave in the tank with and without baffles the simulated wave height of the les method and the partition k ε model used in this paper under different grid conditions respectively the excitation frequency of the sloshing model without baffle is set to 1 1 hz the liquid in sloshing model with 5 baffles has a slightly higher natural frequency due to the presence of baffles so the excitation frequency is set to 1 3 hz in addition the observation of wave height should be executed when the fluctuation process becomes stable so we take the results after 25 it can be seen from fig 6 and fig 7 that the simulation results are basically consistent with the measurement results and the errors are tiny under different grid conditions it can be clearly seen that the wave height in the tank with five baffles is significantly lower than the tank without baffle which also proves the effect of the baffle on the sloshing of the tank in addition it can be seen from the experimental measurement results that the wave height does not conform to the sinusoidal fluctuation completely and there is a certain deformation at the peak this is because the wall surface is not completely smooth in actual the viscosity of the liquid and the wall surface generate a delay in the processes of sloshing and falling in this paper the simulation uses the low reynolds number k ε model in the near wall region and the liquid viscosity is set to simulate the deformation trend at the peak properly if a more accurate deformation at the peak is in need the viscosity of the liquid and the roughness of the wall should be adjusted through abundant simulations meanwhile we also compared the wave height results under different grid conditions the smaller the grid size the greater the number of grids and the amount of calculation but the results are more accurate we selected grids of different isotropic and anisotropic sizes for comparison and also compared with the simulation results of the les method in the reference the error rate time step and calculation time of different grids are shown in table 1 and table 2 among them grid 3 10 5 2 mm has the lowest error rate so this grid is selected to simulate the tank sloshing process at the same time we can see that under the condition of similar error rates the time required to calculate with k ε model is lower than that of the les model 4 results and discussion this chapter simulates the sloshing process of a tank with baffles the ubh and ebh schemes were simulated respectively the effect of various baffle parameters external excitation baffle number baffle height distribution in controlling tank sloshing is proved by comparing the frequency spectrum flow status velocity vector wave height and hydrodynamic force in the tank 4 1 spectrum this section analyzes and compares the frequency spectrum of liquid sloshing in the tank in chapter 3 it is calculated by formula 16 that when the liquid height is 80 mm the natural frequency f n of the liquid is 0 85 hz to simulate its natural frequency the liquid in the tank is exerted an initial distribution which means the tank is tilt to a certain angel then let the tank return to the balance position and hold still the liquid will fall back freely the spectrum density function obtained by fourier transform through matlab is shown in fig 8 a then we give an external excitation with a frequency of 1 3 hz to the tank and the spectrum density function is shown in fig 8 b it can be seen from fig 8 a that the natural frequency of the liquid is around 0 79 hz which is close to the 0 85 hz calculated in formula 16 furthermore in the free vibration process 3rd and 5th modes of natural frequencies natural frequency can be found in fig 8 which can be calculated from formula 16 when the value of m is 2 and 3 while the frequency of high mode is higher than 2 hz which is far from the highest excitation frequency so it has less impact on the resonance phenomena after giving the tank excitation of 1 3 hz a clear peak can be seen at 1 3 hz in fig 8 b which proves that the liquid sloshing frequency in the tank will be close to the external frequency under the constant excitation moreover comparing the two graphs in fig 8 it can be clearly seen that the spectrum density function under constant external excitation is smoother and clearer while the liquid has some fluctuations and obvious burrs when there is only gravity excitation 4 2 flow status and the velocity vector this section observed the flow status and the velocity vector of the liquid to compare the suppression effects of different baffle numbers and different baffle height allocations on tank sloshing the water depth h w 80 m m average baffle height h b 40 m m external excitation amplitude a e 15 m m excitation frequency f e 1 3 h z that is sloshing period t 0 77 s since the lateral width of the tank l 500 m m the interval d between two adjacent baffle is adjusted according to the number baffles n that is d 500 n 1 in order to obtain more stable simulation results we compare the data from t 0 25 41 s the sampling time interval is a quarter of the period fig 10 and fig 11 are diagrams of the flow status in tank without baffles and the profiles of the velocity vector respectively the velocity vector is the resultant of the velocity horizontal and vertical with the side wall which can be shown in fig 9 when the velocity component paralleled with the wall is large the hydrodynamic force on the wall caused by the sloshing is small however when the horizontal velocity component is large the hydrodynamic force on the wall caused by the sloshing is large therefore we should analyze the hydrodynamic force on the wall and the profiles of the velocity vector synthetically it can be seen from fig 10 that the liquid in the tank sloshes stable relatively due to the excitation frequency of 1 3 hz is not near the natural frequency and we can see an obvious traveling wave at the free surface at the moment of t t 0 the tank is in the equilibrium position and the liquid in the tank is going to flow from the right to the left at the moment of t t 0 t 2 the liquid is going to flow from the left to the right compared with the profile of the velocity vector at the same time in fig 11 it can be seen that the liquid flow on the free surface at the middle of the tank is violent according to the law of conservation of energy and the principle of spring vibration the speed is the largest when the displacement is the smallest so we can find from fig 10 a c that when the liquid is near the equilibrium position the velocity of the liquid is relatively high at the same time the flow at the bottom and sides of the tank is mild relatively at the moments t 0 t 4 and t t 0 3 t 4 the tank swayed to the maximum roll angle on both sides and the wave height at the wall is large it can be seen from the velocity vector profile in fig 11 that the velocity is small at this time meanwhile the phase of the velocity vector reverses at the wall amd flows to the opposite side fig 11 e f is the velocity vector profile at the moments t t 0 3 t 8 and t t 0 7 t 8 respectively the obvious vortices can be seen in the figure this is due to the large characteristic length of the tank in the rolling direction and without the intervention of the baffle after the fluid on the rolling direction contacts the wall the velocity direction of the liquid close to the wall reverses while the fluid on the far side is still moving forward due to inertia at the same time the fluid velocity near the free surface is higher than that near the bilge the combined effect produced an obvious vortex and the velocity vector around the vortex is large relatively the five baffles ebh scheme was simulated the liquid status and the velocity vector profiles are shown in fig 12 and fig 13 from fig 12 we can find that the flow in the tank with 5 baffles is similar to the tank without baffle and there are also obvious traveling waves however by comparing the velocity vector profile at the same moment it can be seen that the velocity near the free surface with five baffles is lower than the tank without baffle the equipment of the baffle suppresses the sloshing phenomena by consuming the energy of the liquid when the liquid sloshes to the baffle because the speed of the liquid decreases when it near the baffle which can be seen from fig 13 at the moments t t 0 and t t 0 t 2 the velocity vector is shown in fig 13 a c the vortexes are formed between the baffle and the wall but there is few vortexes and the flow velocity are very small between two adjacent baffles at the moments t t 0 t 4 and t t 0 3 t 4 the tank rolled to the maximum angle and the flow velocity was significantly lower than the tank without baffles at the same time due to the separation effect of the baffle on the fluid some vortices are generated at the top of the baffle but as the number of baffles increases the vortex on the top of the baffle gradually weakens by comparing the flow velocity vectors in figs 11 and 13 we can conclude that the baffles have the effect on suppressing tank sloshing phenomena in the preliminary simulation of tank sloshing in section 2 we found that the wave heights are different at different positions therefore an ubh scheme is proposed we set different baffle height gradient k for comparison and observe the effect of different factors on tank sloshing when the gradient k is positive that is the baffle height increases from both sides to the center the flow status and velocity vector profile in the tank are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 respectively taking k 0 45 as an example the height of the baffle is 10 mm 47 5 mm 85 mm 47 5 mm and 10 mm and the height of the middle baffle is slightly higher than the liquid height h w it can be seen from fig 13 that because the middle baffle is slightly higher than the height of the liquid carrier h w so the middle baffle almost divides the tank into two independent tanks during the sloshing process and only a small amount of liquid will cross the baffle when the tank sloshing is violent in this almost independent half tank there are two baffles to suppress sloshing this phenomenon of tank segmentation is particularly obvious in fig 14 a c compared with the model of 5 baffles ebh scheme it can be seen from fig 15 that the liquid velocity is lower in the ubh scheme when the gradient k 0 45 at the moments t t 0 and t t 0 t 2 as shown in fig 15 a c the velocity is the maximum and a vortex is formed between the baffle and the wall the flow in the tank is similar to the ebh scheme while the difference is that there is also a small amount of vortex between the baffles at the moments t t 0 t 4 and t t 0 3 t 4 the tank rolled to the maximum angle the velocity has a sudden increase at the top of the baffles which is similar to the ebh scheme but the increase in the ubh scheme was more moderate because the middle baffle is higher than the liquid height so the liquid in the tank is separated to two parts which is corresponding to the method of subdivision and in each part there are two baffles to restrain the sloshing phenomena furthermore when the liquid is separated into two parts the natural frequency will increase according to literature ibrahim 2005 but it is not near the exciting frequency of 1 3 hz the resonance will not occur while the exciting frequency changed the result will be different which will be discussed in section 4 3 in summary compared with the ebh scheme the ubh scheme with gradient k 0 45 control the tank sloshing phenomena more effective when the gradient k is negative that is the baffle height decreases from both sides to the middle the flow status and velocity vector profile are shown in fig 16 and fig 17 respectively take k 0 2 as an example the height of the baffle is 53 3 mm 36 7 mm 20 mm 36 7 mm 53 3 mm the velocity vector profile is shown fig 16 similar to the condition of k 0 45 five baffles of unequal height almost divide the tank into three parts the left side of the first baffle the right side of the fifth baffle and the rest middle part at the moments t t 0 and t t 0 t 2 the velocity vector is similar to the model without baffles the velocity near the free surface is larger while compared to ebh scheme the sloshing is violent in ubh scheme with a negative k due to the cross section area of the separated part near the side wall under the condition that k 0 2 is smaller than the case of k 0 45 at the moments t t 0 t 4 and t t 0 3 t 4 the velocity vector in the tank is smaller than k 0 45 however in this case the impact force of the fluid on the two baffles close to the wall is greater and the requirements of the baffles are higher therefore the ubh scheme with negative k is usually not considered this section analyzes the suppression effect of different baffle height allocation schemes on the tank sloshing process qualitatively generally speaking the suppression effect is better with more baffles however as the number of baffles is increased to a certain number the suppression effect cannot be optimized by increasing the number of baffles at the same time when the baffle height is unevenly distributed that is when the baffle height has a certain gradient it will also affect the suppression when the gradient k 0 45 the suppression effect on tank sloshing is better when the gradient is negative the suppression effect on tank sloshing is not as obvious as the ebh scheme and the requirements for the baffle are higher therefore the ubh scheme proposed in this paper has a better suppression effect on tank sloshing under certain conditions 4 3 wave height this chapter quantitatively analyzes the suppression effect of the number and height distribution of baffles by comparing the wave height in the tank the effects of different external excitation frequencies different baffle numbers and different baffle height distribution schemes on the wave height are compared first we compared the baffle height distribution schemes with gradient of 0 2 0 0 45 each scheme excites the tank with external frequencies of 0 5 hz 0 7 hz 0 9 hz 1 1 hz and 1 3 hz in addition the water depth h w 80 m m the average baffle height h b 40 m m and the external excitation amplitude a e 15 m m the wave height contrast is shown in fig 18 it can be seen from fig 18 that when the gradient k 0 and k 0 45 the tank sloshes more violent when the external excitation near 0 7 hz the amplitude of wave height decreases with the increase of external excitation frequency when the gradient k 0 2 the liquid in the tank sloshes more violent when the external excitation near 0 9 hz it shows that although the total height of the baffle in the tank is the same different height allocations will also affect the natural frequency of the liquid in the tank at the same time under the condition of the same external excitation frequency the baffle height allocation scheme of k 0 45 has the smallest wave height which has a better suppression effect on tank sloshing the comparisons of the influence of different baffle height gradient on the wave height is shown in fig 19 in addition the suppression effect of different baffle number ebh scheme on tank sloshing is also compared by comparing the different numbers of equal height baffles on the ordinate axis it can be seen that the suppression effect on tank sloshing is the better when there are more baffles although increasing the number of baffles can suppress tank sloshing better as the number of baffles increases the optimization effect becomes weaker and weaker when there are five baffles and their total height is the same different baffle height allocations also have a certain impact on the wave height as the gradient of the baffle height increases the wave height of the liquid in the tank decreases gradually to reduce the wave height the condition of k 0 6 has the best suppression effect but considering the stress and structure of the middle baffle this extreme condition is not considered when the gradient of the baffle height is negative although the wave height is slightly higher than 5 baffles ebh scheme it is still lower than the case of 3 baffles ebh scheme it can be seen that the number of baffles or the total height of the baffles effect the sloshing phenomena more 4 4 hydrodynamic force in addition to the adverse effects of tank sloshing on the stability of the ship the violent impact pressure may also damage the bulkhead if the bulkhead is damaged the liquid in the tank will flow out and the pressure in the tank will decrease at the same time the overflow of the lng vaporization will be dangerous therefore this section compares the impulse pressure and non pulse pressure on the bulkhead during the sloshing process we compare and analysis the average hydrodynamic force on the right side wall of the tank 5 baffles and without baffle it can be seen from fig 20 that after the external excitation is applied the bulkhead will be subjected to a large impulse pressure in a short duration as time increases this impulsive pressure disappears and the bulkhead is subjected to periodic non pulse pressure with small amplitude by comparing the two figures in fig 20 a b it is obvious that the baffles can restrain hydrodynamic force on the bulkhead the hydrodynamic force on bulkhead of the tank without baffle starts to stabilize after 20s while the tank with 5 baffles stabilizes in about 5s and the pulse pressure duration is shorter moreover the amplitude of the non pulse pressure on the side wall of the tank with the baffles is significantly lower than the tank without baffle it also proves the baffle s effect on controlling the tank sloshing we compare the average hydrodynamic force on the bulkhead under different baffle height gradient schemes fig 21 a compares the cases that the height of the baffle increases decreases and fixed from both sides to the center it can be seen that the hydrodynamic force on the bulkhead in ubh scheme is lower than the ebh scheme when the baffle height decreases from both sides to the center the height of the baffle which is close to the bulkhead is too high and a small part of the fluid is separated between this baffle and the bulkhead the hydrodynamic force on the bulkhead is very small because this separated fluid is the only thing that affects the hydrodynamic force on the bulkhead however the other side of the baffle is impacted by most of the liquid from the middle and the hydrodynamic force is relatively high so this distribution scheme does not meet the actual needs in general the distribution scheme of increasing baffle height from both sides to the center is more effective therefore in fig 21 b we compare the influence of different baffle height gradient k on bulkhead hydrodynamic force it can be seen that the average hydrodynamic force on the bulkhead is the smallest under the condition of the baffle height gradient k 0 45 finally we set the liquid height of 50 mm 25 80 mm 40 100 mm 50 120 mm 60 160 mm 80 respectively and the height of the five baffles is 40 mm then we compare the average hydrodynamic force of the bulkhead under different filling conditions the observed variables are the peak value of the impulse pressure and non pulse pressure it can be seen from fig 22 that with the increase of the liquid height in the tank the impulse pressure and non pulse pressure on the bulkhead gradually increase at this time there is a dangerous loading condition in the interval of 60 80 of the liquid loading rate the average hydrodynamic force on the bulkhead is relatively high and it is in a relatively dangerous state the specific dangerous load condition needs a dynamic load rate simulation for analysis which can be researched in the future work through the comparison of various parameters in this section it can be seen that increasing the number and height of baffles can inhibit tank sloshing better under the same number of baffles and the total height of the baffles the ubh scheme of a certain gradient has better performance than the ebh scheme 5 conclusion this paper studies the effect of baffles with different parameters on the controlling of the tank sloshing we compare the wave height spectral density bulkhead hydrodynamic force and flow velocity vector of the liquid in the tank under the different number of baffles the liquid loading rate external excitation frequency conditions in the numerical simulation of tank sloshing by adjusting the parameters of the k ε model the deformation at peak of the wave height in the tank was simulated to make it more in line with the actual situation at the same time this paper also derives the numerical relationship between the liquid height and the wave height so as to obtain the data of the wave height in the tank by measuring the surface elevation directly finally we propose an ubh scheme and compare it with the ebh scheme with the same total baffle height and number by setting different baffle height gradient the suppression effects of different height allocation schemes on tank sloshing are compared numerical simulation results show that under certain load conditions the ubh scheme with proper baffle height gradient has a better suppression effect on the tank sloshing process in addition the scheme that height of the baffle decreases from sides to the center and the scheme with a large positive gradient is usually not adopted due to stress and structural reasons this article only gives a certain reference range for the dangerous load condition of the liquid in the tank the specific value of the dangerous load and the dangerous load under different conditions need to be studied later at the same time the optimal baffle height gradient under different load conditions is also a question worth exploring we will give a research in the future work credit authorship contribution statement yu ying tang conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft

20547,tank sloshing is a hotspot issue in the design of a vessel the liquid in a partially filled tank sloshes along with the ship except the negative effects to the stability of the ship the sloshing phenomena may damage the wall of the tank due to the attacking pressure therefore the control of the tank sloshing is one of the researches emphasizes while the baffles in tanks have positive effect on the control of the tank sloshing so we compare influence of different baffle factors such as the number of baffles the liquid rate excitation frequency then compare the effect by investigating the wave height spectrum hydrodynamic force and the velocity vector the simulation processes are executed in star ccm in the numerical simulation of the tank sloshing we obtained a deformation at the peak of the wave height by adjusting the factors in the k ε model which is more approximate to the experimental results moreover in order to obtain the wave height through the direct measurement of the liquid height we derive the relationship between the liquid height and the wave height finally we proposed an unequal baffle height ubh allocation scheme then compared the performance of ubh scheme with the equal baffle height ebh scheme which has the same baffle number under the condition that the total height of all baffles is the same the performance of different baffle height allocation schemes are compared by setting different baffle height gradient numerical simulation results showed that the allocation of the baffle height has effect on the control of tank sloshing the ubh scheme with the proper baffle height gradient performs better than the ebh scheme when we take no account of the baffle strength keywords liquid sloshing vertical baffle numerical simulation hydrodynamic force 1 introduction as the scale of the lng become larger and larger the size of lng tanks increases with it the partially filled tank sloshes when the hull shakes under the excitation of the wave it is known well that the hydrodynamic load exerted by liquid sloshing can cause severe structural damage marco 2006 moreover if the excitation frequency is close to the natural frequency of the liquid in tanks a violent oscillation may occur due to the resonance which brings large impulse load to the tank wall changwen et al 2019 meanwhile the generating set of the lng is under working condition the liquid height in the tank changes dynamically this dynamic change of the liquid will change the natural frequency of the liquid in tank the probability of the occurrence of the resonance will increase then the dynamic hydrodynamic force on the tank wall will increase instantaneously therefore the analysis of the impulse load in tank and the control of tank sloshing is needing to be settled the tank sloshing phenomena mainly influenced by the size of the tank the liquid height the excitation frequency and the anti sloshing set lamb 1932 the intensity measurement of the tank sloshing usually realized by the investigation of the hydrodynamic force on the wall the free surface status wave height velocity resonance and so on xiang 2008 generally there are four types waves in tank including standing waves traveling waves hydraulic jump and vortex when we investigate the sloshing status in tanks meng 2008 and there are two types pressure causes by the sloshing we can find on the wall it can be divided in pulsating pressure and non pulse pressure the pulsating pressure is the local high pressure which continues a short time the non pulse pressure is the familiar dynamic pressure which changes relatively the analyze method includes theoretically analysis numerical simulation and experiment research the experiment result is the most accurate but it cost a lot of manpower and material resource at present the experiment researchers mainly aim at rectangular tank and the filling liquid is usually the water fujino et al used shaking table experiments to study the vibration of a single degree of freedom structure with an attached tuned liquid damper tld fujino et al 1992 min luo et al experimentally investigated the three dimensional sloshing in a membrane type lng liquefied natural gas tank under combined roll and pitch excitations in 2020 min et al 2020 saravanan et al carried out a series of experiments with different base aspect ratios length to width of tank different water depths wide range of excitation amplitudes and frequencies in order to investigate the nonlinear shallow water sloshing in detail saravanan and deepak 2020 to realize the numerical simulation of the tank sloshing phenomena many models and methods have been proposed with different emphasizes choun and yun used the linear water wave theory to study the sloshing characteristics of the fluid in a rectangular tank choun and yun 1996 generally the numerical simulation of the turbulence includes direct numerical simulation dns and indirect numerical simulation les method statistical average method and rans dongming liu adopted the large eddy simulation les approach to model the turbulence effect in sloshing tanks by using the smagorinsky sub grid scale sgs closure model dongming and pengzhi 2008 s brizzolara et al studied sloshing loads in partially filled tanks with rans method brizzolara et al 2011 dongxi liu et al proposed a new hybrid rans les approach to improve the predictive accuracy of rans and the computational efficiency of les the performances of present hybrid method are similar with that of the classical les model which can provide very accurate solutions dongxi et al 2017 jianjian xin et al investigated large amplitude sloshing in a prismatic tank with or without a baffle by a cartesian grid based three dimensional 3d multiphase flow model in this model an improved ghost cell method with a unified reconstruction scheme is developed to enforce boundary conditions on the slope walls of the tank jianjian et al 2020 bageerathan carried out the numerical investigation of sloshing in tank with hoariert baffles under resonant excitation using cfd code and compare the result with an experiment in 2021 bageerathan and thundil 2021 in this paper we analyze the sloshing by numerical simulation and compare the result with the experiment to demonstrate the feasibility of the numerical model then we simulate the sloshing in tanks with the baffles on the basis of the numerical model which has been demonstrated the investigation of the free surface is of great importance in tank sloshing the existed method to track the moving surface can be divided into two types front capturing and front tracking the front capturing includes wave transport volume of fluid level set and so on the front tracking includes dynamic mash mac wave height function and so on saravanan and deepak 2020 mac and vof methods are widely used while tracking the free surface in sloshing tanks vof method was proposed by hirt in 1981 the core is the introducing of the volume fraction f the key technology to track the free surface is the calculation of the changing volume fraction and the reconstruction of the free surface hirt and nichols 1981 due to the dangerous caused by the tank sloshing many methods against the sloshing have been proposed for example adding baffles flotage hasheminejad and mohammadi 2016 flexible absorbers gradinscak et al 2011 controlling the liquid carrier rate and subdividing the tank mitra et al 2010 panigrahy et al 2009 showed experimentally that baffles in a tank decrease the sloshing effect considerably because sharp edged baffles create turbulence in the flow field thereby dissipating the excess kinetic energy to the walls panigrahy et al 2009 adding the baffles in the tank can restrain the sloshing phenomena significantly therefore the baffles interest many researchers they payed attentions on the type number height poriness and the position of the baffles akyildiz 2012 and jung et al 2012 observed that increasing the submergence depths of vertical baffles may enhance liquid sloshing suppression akyildiz 2012 goudarzi and sabbagh yazdi 2012 carried out the experimental measurements to evaluate the efficiency of three types of baffles upper and lower mounted vertical baffles as well as horizontal baffles on hydrodynamic damping of the liquid motion goudarzi and sabbagh yazdi 2012 ebrahimian et al presented a developed successive method to determine sloshing natural frequencies for multi baffled axisymmetric containers with arbitrary geometries confirming that the baffle position on sloshing natural frequencies was more important than the baffle size in their study multi baffles were only represented by ring baffles ebrahimian et al 2013 chu et al studied the sloshing phenomenon in a rectangular water tank with multiple bottom mounted baffles indicating that the natural frequency of the tank can be altered by the multiple baffles and be related to the effective water depth above the baffles and yet only vertical baffles were considered chu et al 2018 there are also many other researches which focus on the anti sloshing device such as the baffles the vertical baffles equipped on the top or the bottom of the tank can alleviate the sloshing in tanks effectively many researches about the vertical baffles have been raised by numerical or experimental methods j h jung et al simulated the liquid sloshing in tank with vertical baffles by numerical methods he set the baffle height the liquid height as the variable and investigated the hydrodynamic force surface elevation velocity vector profile in the tank to compare the effect of the baffles jung et al 2012 hao q et al study the effect of horizontal and vertical baffle position then investigate the hydrodynamic force wave height to demonstrate the baffle position act differently on the sloshing phenomena in 2019 hao et al 2019 liting yu focused on the relative position of the baffles to compare the effect on the sloshing phenomena in 2020 liting et al 2020 furthermore porous baffle is also a research hotspot i h cho et al study the porous vertical elastic baffles with experiment in 2016 this paper compared different baffle position porosity submerged depth cho 2020 arun george also demonstrated the effect of the porous baffles with experiments in 2020 arun and cho 2020 moreover there are many scholars have study other baffle form such as horizontal baffle t shaped baffle wang w et al learned the effect of the t shaped and y shaped baffles in 2016 wenyuan et al 2016 and ugur oral et al learned the effect of the t shaped baffle in 2019 uğur et al 2019 they demonstrated the inhibiting effect of the baffles on the sloshing mohammad reza shekari studied the ring baffle in a steel cylindrical tank and summarized the installation of baffle rings inside the liquid tank can diminish the dynamic response during severe earthquake significantly in 2020 mohammad 2020 from the related works above we can find that the unequal allocation of the baffle height haven t been tried yet and part of scholars investigated the surface elevation while parts of them investigated the wave height to estimate the sloshing of the tanks but none of them pay attention to the relationship between the factors such as surface elevation displacement and wave height therefore this paper simulated the tank sloshing with baffles on the basis of the experiment in chiaren et al 2018 the simulation result shows that the wave height in the different position the same height is different so we proposed an unequal allocation of baffle height in this paper the main contribution of the paper can be listed as follows 1 a lesser amount of computation compared to the les method the high reynolds number in core region and the low reynolds number in near wall region k ε model will reduce 40 computing time under the similar error rate 2 more accurate simulation at the turning of the wave which means the phase at 90 and 270 from the experiment result we could find that the surface elevation is not completely conform to the sinusoidal function it has a little deformation at the peak of the wave because the actual wall is not completely smooth the viscosity of the wall and the liquid will result in a little resistance in the process of the sloshing so the rise and the fall at the wall will be alleviate in this paper a low reynolds number k ε model is used for the near wall region and the liquid viscosity and wall roughness can be set to simulate the deformation trend at the peak 3 the derivation of the relationship between the liquid height and the wave height the surface elevation is consisted of the vertical tank displacement and the wave height however the investigation just obtained the surface elevation rather than the wave height in this paper we derived the relationship between the surface elevation and the wave height through the geometric calculation of the sloshing tank 4 the unequal allocation scheme of the baffle height and the analysis of its effects on the tank sloshing in the process of the tank sloshing the wave height is different in the different position so in this paper we propose an unequal baffle height allocation scheme and the five baffle of same height model is simulated as a contrast scheme we compared two types of allocation the baffle height increases or decreases from the sides to the center meanwhile the different rates of changing have been set to investigate the effect on the tank sloshing the simulation results showed that the performance of the ubh scheme with proper baffle height gradient is better than the ebh scheme while taking the baffle strength into concern the ubh scheme which baffle height increases from the sides to the center has more practical significance 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equation the flow of fluid is governed by the conservation laws the basic laws of conservation include the conservation of mass the conservation of momentum and the conservation of energy if the flow is in a turbulent state the system must comply with turbulent transport equations in addition the governing equations are the mathematical descriptions of these conservation laws the flow must satisfy the conservation of mass that is the mass increase in a fluid cell per unit time is equal to the net mass flowing into the cell in the same time interval according to this law the mass conservation equation can be described as follows 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 where t represents the time u is the velocity ρ is the density of the liquid i represent the direction x i is the coordinate on the i direction the flow must satisfy the conservation of momentum that is the changing rate of the momentum in a fluid cell is equal to the sum of various external forces acting on this cell according to this law the momentum conservation equation which is also known as n s equation can be described as follows 2 t ρ u i x i ρ u i u j p x i τ i j x i ρ g i f i where p is the pressure g is the gravitational acceleration τ i j is the stress vector f i is the other energy item the equations will be solved by star ccm using the finite volume method the widely used standard k ε model was adopted in this paper which is proposed by lauder and spalding in 1972 the model is consisted with the equations of turbulence energy k and turbulence dissipation rate ε 3 ρ k t ρ k u i x i x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k ρ ε 4 ρ ε t ρ ε u i x i x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j c 1 ε k g k c 2 ε ρ ε 2 k where μ is the laminar viscosity coefficient μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε is the turbulent viscosity coefficient g k is the generation term of turbulence energy k due to the average velocity gradient the calculation formular is subscribed below 5 g k μ t u i x j u j x i u i x j according to the recommended values of launder et al and subsequent experimental verification the model constant values are as follows c 1 ε 1 44 c 2 ε 1 92 c μ 0 09 σ k 1 0 σ ε 1 3 however the standard k ε model is not applicable in whole fluid region experimental studies have shown that for a fully developed turbulent flow with solid walls the fluid region can be divided into wall region viscous bottom layer transition layer logarithmic layer and core region according to the normal direction from the wall the standard k ε model which is the high reynolds number model is only suitable for the core region where turbulence is fully developed for the flow near the wall the reynolds number is low and the turbulence is not fully developed therefore it is necessary to use the low reynolds number k ε model to solve the calculation problem at the region where viscosity has a great effect in order to apply the low reynolds number k ε model in the near wall region properly we refined the mesh near the wall a mesh is thinner when it is closer to the wall the mesh zone of the model is shown in fig 1 in addition all y wall treatment in star ccm is adopted this treatment uses a blended wall function that can describe the velocity and turbulence in the three boundary layers viscous sublayer buffer layer and log layer arun and cho 2020 it can automatically calculate the y value according to the incoming flow velocity and the boundary grid and automatically switch the wall algorithm then the low reynolds number k ε model can be described as follows 6 ρ k t ρ k u i x i x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k ρ ε 2 μ k 1 2 n 2 7 ρ ε t ρ k u i x i x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j c 1 ε k g k f 1 c 2 ε ρ ε k f 2 2 μ μ t ρ 2 u n 2 2 where n represents the normal coordinates of the wall u is the velocity parallel with the wall μ t is the turbulent viscosity coefficient which can be calculated as follows 8 μ t c μ f μ ρ k 2 ε the coefficients different from the standard k ε model are calculated as follows 9 f 1 1 0 10 f 2 1 0 0 3 e r e t 2 11 f μ e 2 5 1 r e t 50 12 r e t ρ k 2 η ε obviously while the turbulence reynolds number r e t is high enough the values of f 1 f 2 and f μ are close to 1 0 and formula 6 7 is turn to the standard k ε model equation 3 4 2 2 free surface the surface tracking in this paper is realized by volume of fluid vof method zhenbing 2011 the basic idea of the vof method is introducing a fluid volume fraction f which is a step function the different values represent the composition of each phase in the unit meng 2008 here the fluid volume fraction f that is the volume fraction of liquid in the unit can be defined as 13 f ρ ρ a ρ w ρ a where ρ represents the average density of the fluid domain ρ a is the density of the air ρ w is the density of the water when f 1 the unit is filled with liquid when f 0 the unit is filled with air the f of the unit near the liquid air interface is between 0 and 1 the gradient of f can be used to determine the normal direction of the interface after the value of each unit and the gradient are obtained the approximate position of the free surface can be determined in each unit combining equations 1 and 13 the governing equation of f can be obtained as 14 f t u i f x i 0 2 3 excitation in order to simulate the tank sloshing it is necessary to bring an external rolling sinusoidal excitation to the tank artificially if the external excitation frequency is near the natural frequency of the liquid in the tank it is easy to cause resonance and make the sloshing process very violent therefore it is necessary to estimate the natural frequency of the liquid in the tank as a reference the estimation formula of the natural frequency f n of the liquid in the rectangular tank is calculated as follows ibrahim 2005 15 ω n 2 g k m t a n h k m h w 16 f n ω n 2 π 1 2 π g k m t a n h k m h w 17 k m 2 m 1 π l where h w is the height of the liquid l is the characteristic length on the sloshing direction m 1 2 3 is the mode of the natural frequency in this paper the excitation to the tank can be expressed as follows 18 f a e ω 2 s i n ω t π 2 where a e is the amplitude of the external excitation the angular frequency ω 2 π f e f e is the excitation frequency the external rolling excitation ω 2 π f e is given by the experiments in literature arun and cho 2020 in the literature the amplitude of excitation is given as 15 mm according to formula 18 the excitation is given in form of force which is in direct proportion to the accelerated speed the speed of rotation is the integration of the accelerated speed and the roll amplitude is the integration of the speed of rotation which unit is radian 2 4 the ubh unequal baffle height scheme and the different gradient k through the preliminary simulation of the tank sloshing with five baffles the observation and analysis of the wave height are carried out at different positions on the surface and the results are shown in fig 2 it can be seen that the sloshing amplitude of the liquid at the different positions in the tank is different it is caused by the combined effect of the wall and the external excitation therefore we will propose an ubh scheme to suppress the sloshing more effective a tank with 5 baffles is established as an example and the distribution of baffles is shown in fig 3 5 baffles are distributed symmetrically about the middle baffle y1 y2 y3 are the height of the baffles respectively ①②③④⑤ is the serial number of the baffles baffle ① is set as the y axis and the bilge is set as the x axis to establish a coordinate system the angle between the horizontal plane and the connecting line from the top of baffle ① to baffle ③ is θ therefore the value of the gradient k is t a n θ the interval between two adjacent baffles is 83 3 mm and the relationship among the baffle height is 19 y 2 y 1 83 3 k y 3 y 1 166 7 k taking 5 baffles with a height of 40 mm as a comparison the total height of the 5 baffles should be 200 mm 20 y 1 y 1 83 3 k 2 y 1 166 7 k 200 the value range of gradient k can be obtained by setting the extreme heights of baffle ① and baffle ③ when the baffle height increases from the sides to the center the range of k is 0 k 0 6 when the baffle height decreases from the sides to the center the value range of k value is 0 4 k 0 the case of k 0 means the baffle height is equal therefore when the gradient k is positive the values are set as 0 1 0 3 0 45 and 0 6 respectively for comparison when the gradient k is negative the values are set as 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 as comparison for example when k 0 3 the heights of baffles are 20 mm 45 mm 70 mm 45 mm and 20 mm respectively 2 5 the relationship between the liquid height and the wave height in the process of tank sloshing the liquid height and the wave height in the tank are not the same concept fig 4 shows a schematic diagram of the tank rolling to a certain angle with the center of the bilge as the center of rotation it can be seen from the figure that the liquid height in the tank at x is h and h w is the actual wave height here meanwhile the angle between the bilge and the equilibrium position is θ and the wave height in the tank can be calculated from the measured liquid height which can also use to judge whether the liquid in the tank touches the roof the relationship is derived as follows 21 h w c o s θ h x t a n θ in addition when the liquid mass in the tank is m the tank sloshing angle θ at t 0 can be obtained by integrating the external excitation function 22 θ 0 t 0 a e ω 2 s i n ω t π 2 m d t d t the initial value of θ is 0 and the sign of the value represents the rolling direction of the tank the positive sign represents the tank rolling to the left and the negative sign represents the tank rolling to the right 3 model validation this paper uses the k ε model to simulate the sloshing process in a rectangular tank the low reynolds number k ε model is used in the region near the wall where turbulence is not fully developed and the standard k ε model is used in the core region the free surface is captured by the vof method the fluid motion is solved by the continuity equation and the n s equation in this paper the middle section of the tank established based on the experimental model is shown in fig 5 the size of the tank is 500 300 200 mm the baffle height is 40 mm and its thickness is 5 mm therefore when the filling height is 80 mm the natural frequency f n of the liquid in the tank is 0 85 hz according to formula 16 in order to prove the validity of the model the numerical simulation results in this paper will be compared with the experimental results in the literature arun and cho 2020 and the simulation results of the les method we compared the measured height of the wave in the tank with and without baffles the simulated wave height of the les method and the partition k ε model used in this paper under different grid conditions respectively the excitation frequency of the sloshing model without baffle is set to 1 1 hz the liquid in sloshing model with 5 baffles has a slightly higher natural frequency due to the presence of baffles so the excitation frequency is set to 1 3 hz in addition the observation of wave height should be executed when the fluctuation process becomes stable so we take the results after 25 it can be seen from fig 6 and fig 7 that the simulation results are basically consistent with the measurement results and the errors are tiny under different grid conditions it can be clearly seen that the wave height in the tank with five baffles is significantly lower than the tank without baffle which also proves the effect of the baffle on the sloshing of the tank in addition it can be seen from the experimental measurement results that the wave height does not conform to the sinusoidal fluctuation completely and there is a certain deformation at the peak this is because the wall surface is not completely smooth in actual the viscosity of the liquid and the wall surface generate a delay in the processes of sloshing and falling in this paper the simulation uses the low reynolds number k ε model in the near wall region and the liquid viscosity is set to simulate the deformation trend at the peak properly if a more accurate deformation at the peak is in need the viscosity of the liquid and the roughness of the wall should be adjusted through abundant simulations meanwhile we also compared the wave height results under different grid conditions the smaller the grid size the greater the number of grids and the amount of calculation but the results are more accurate we selected grids of different isotropic and anisotropic sizes for comparison and also compared with the simulation results of the les method in the reference the error rate time step and calculation time of different grids are shown in table 1 and table 2 among them grid 3 10 5 2 mm has the lowest error rate so this grid is selected to simulate the tank sloshing process at the same time we can see that under the condition of similar error rates the time required to calculate with k ε model is lower than that of the les model 4 results and discussion this chapter simulates the sloshing process of a tank with baffles the ubh and ebh schemes were simulated respectively the effect of various baffle parameters external excitation baffle number baffle height distribution in controlling tank sloshing is proved by comparing the frequency spectrum flow status velocity vector wave height and hydrodynamic force in the tank 4 1 spectrum this section analyzes and compares the frequency spectrum of liquid sloshing in the tank in chapter 3 it is calculated by formula 16 that when the liquid height is 80 mm the natural frequency f n of the liquid is 0 85 hz to simulate its natural frequency the liquid in the tank is exerted an initial distribution which means the tank is tilt to a certain angel then let the tank return to the balance position and hold still the liquid will fall back freely the spectrum density function obtained by fourier transform through matlab is shown in fig 8 a then we give an external excitation with a frequency of 1 3 hz to the tank and the spectrum density function is shown in fig 8 b it can be seen from fig 8 a that the natural frequency of the liquid is around 0 79 hz which is close to the 0 85 hz calculated in formula 16 furthermore in the free vibration process 3rd and 5th modes of natural frequencies natural frequency can be found in fig 8 which can be calculated from formula 16 when the value of m is 2 and 3 while the frequency of high mode is higher than 2 hz which is far from the highest excitation frequency so it has less impact on the resonance phenomena after giving the tank excitation of 1 3 hz a clear peak can be seen at 1 3 hz in fig 8 b which proves that the liquid sloshing frequency in the tank will be close to the external frequency under the constant excitation moreover comparing the two graphs in fig 8 it can be clearly seen that the spectrum density function under constant external excitation is smoother and clearer while the liquid has some fluctuations and obvious burrs when there is only gravity excitation 4 2 flow status and the velocity vector this section observed the flow status and the velocity vector of the liquid to compare the suppression effects of different baffle numbers and different baffle height allocations on tank sloshing the water depth h w 80 m m average baffle height h b 40 m m external excitation amplitude a e 15 m m excitation frequency f e 1 3 h z that is sloshing period t 0 77 s since the lateral width of the tank l 500 m m the interval d between two adjacent baffle is adjusted according to the number baffles n that is d 500 n 1 in order to obtain more stable simulation results we compare the data from t 0 25 41 s the sampling time interval is a quarter of the period fig 10 and fig 11 are diagrams of the flow status in tank without baffles and the profiles of the velocity vector respectively the velocity vector is the resultant of the velocity horizontal and vertical with the side wall which can be shown in fig 9 when the velocity component paralleled with the wall is large the hydrodynamic force on the wall caused by the sloshing is small however when the horizontal velocity component is large the hydrodynamic force on the wall caused by the sloshing is large therefore we should analyze the hydrodynamic force on the wall and the profiles of the velocity vector synthetically it can be seen from fig 10 that the liquid in the tank sloshes stable relatively due to the excitation frequency of 1 3 hz is not near the natural frequency and we can see an obvious traveling wave at the free surface at the moment of t t 0 the tank is in the equilibrium position and the liquid in the tank is going to flow from the right to the left at the moment of t t 0 t 2 the liquid is going to flow from the left to the right compared with the profile of the velocity vector at the same time in fig 11 it can be seen that the liquid flow on the free surface at the middle of the tank is violent according to the law of conservation of energy and the principle of spring vibration the speed is the largest when the displacement is the smallest so we can find from fig 10 a c that when the liquid is near the equilibrium position the velocity of the liquid is relatively high at the same time the flow at the bottom and sides of the tank is mild relatively at the moments t 0 t 4 and t t 0 3 t 4 the tank swayed to the maximum roll angle on both sides and the wave height at the wall is large it can be seen from the velocity vector profile in fig 11 that the velocity is small at this time meanwhile the phase of the velocity vector reverses at the wall amd flows to the opposite side fig 11 e f is the velocity vector profile at the moments t t 0 3 t 8 and t t 0 7 t 8 respectively the obvious vortices can be seen in the figure this is due to the large characteristic length of the tank in the rolling direction and without the intervention of the baffle after the fluid on the rolling direction contacts the wall the velocity direction of the liquid close to the wall reverses while the fluid on the far side is still moving forward due to inertia at the same time the fluid velocity near the free surface is higher than that near the bilge the combined effect produced an obvious vortex and the velocity vector around the vortex is large relatively the five baffles ebh scheme was simulated the liquid status and the velocity vector profiles are shown in fig 12 and fig 13 from fig 12 we can find that the flow in the tank with 5 baffles is similar to the tank without baffle and there are also obvious traveling waves however by comparing the velocity vector profile at the same moment it can be seen that the velocity near the free surface with five baffles is lower than the tank without baffle the equipment of the baffle suppresses the sloshing phenomena by consuming the energy of the liquid when the liquid sloshes to the baffle because the speed of the liquid decreases when it near the baffle which can be seen from fig 13 at the moments t t 0 and t t 0 t 2 the velocity vector is shown in fig 13 a c the vortexes are formed between the baffle and the wall but there is few vortexes and the flow velocity are very small between two adjacent baffles at the moments t t 0 t 4 and t t 0 3 t 4 the tank rolled to the maximum angle and the flow velocity was significantly lower than the tank without baffles at the same time due to the separation effect of the baffle on the fluid some vortices are generated at the top of the baffle but as the number of baffles increases the vortex on the top of the baffle gradually weakens by comparing the flow velocity vectors in figs 11 and 13 we can conclude that the baffles have the effect on suppressing tank sloshing phenomena in the preliminary simulation of tank sloshing in section 2 we found that the wave heights are different at different positions therefore an ubh scheme is proposed we set different baffle height gradient k for comparison and observe the effect of different factors on tank sloshing when the gradient k is positive that is the baffle height increases from both sides to the center the flow status and velocity vector profile in the tank are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 respectively taking k 0 45 as an example the height of the baffle is 10 mm 47 5 mm 85 mm 47 5 mm and 10 mm and the height of the middle baffle is slightly higher than the liquid height h w it can be seen from fig 13 that because the middle baffle is slightly higher than the height of the liquid carrier h w so the middle baffle almost divides the tank into two independent tanks during the sloshing process and only a small amount of liquid will cross the baffle when the tank sloshing is violent in this almost independent half tank there are two baffles to suppress sloshing this phenomenon of tank segmentation is particularly obvious in fig 14 a c compared with the model of 5 baffles ebh scheme it can be seen from fig 15 that the liquid velocity is lower in the ubh scheme when the gradient k 0 45 at the moments t t 0 and t t 0 t 2 as shown in fig 15 a c the velocity is the maximum and a vortex is formed between the baffle and the wall the flow in the tank is similar to the ebh scheme while the difference is that there is also a small amount of vortex between the baffles at the moments t t 0 t 4 and t t 0 3 t 4 the tank rolled to the maximum angle the velocity has a sudden increase at the top of the baffles which is similar to the ebh scheme but the increase in the ubh scheme was more moderate because the middle baffle is higher than the liquid height so the liquid in the tank is separated to two parts which is corresponding to the method of subdivision and in each part there are two baffles to restrain the sloshing phenomena furthermore when the liquid is separated into two parts the natural frequency will increase according to literature ibrahim 2005 but it is not near the exciting frequency of 1 3 hz the resonance will not occur while the exciting frequency changed the result will be different which will be discussed in section 4 3 in summary compared with the ebh scheme the ubh scheme with gradient k 0 45 control the tank sloshing phenomena more effective when the gradient k is negative that is the baffle height decreases from both sides to the middle the flow status and velocity vector profile are shown in fig 16 and fig 17 respectively take k 0 2 as an example the height of the baffle is 53 3 mm 36 7 mm 20 mm 36 7 mm 53 3 mm the velocity vector profile is shown fig 16 similar to the condition of k 0 45 five baffles of unequal height almost divide the tank into three parts the left side of the first baffle the right side of the fifth baffle and the rest middle part at the moments t t 0 and t t 0 t 2 the velocity vector is similar to the model without baffles the velocity near the free surface is larger while compared to ebh scheme the sloshing is violent in ubh scheme with a negative k due to the cross section area of the separated part near the side wall under the condition that k 0 2 is smaller than the case of k 0 45 at the moments t t 0 t 4 and t t 0 3 t 4 the velocity vector in the tank is smaller than k 0 45 however in this case the impact force of the fluid on the two baffles close to the wall is greater and the requirements of the baffles are higher therefore the ubh scheme with negative k is usually not considered this section analyzes the suppression effect of different baffle height allocation schemes on the tank sloshing process qualitatively generally speaking the suppression effect is better with more baffles however as the number of baffles is increased to a certain number the suppression effect cannot be optimized by increasing the number of baffles at the same time when the baffle height is unevenly distributed that is when the baffle height has a certain gradient it will also affect the suppression when the gradient k 0 45 the suppression effect on tank sloshing is better when the gradient is negative the suppression effect on tank sloshing is not as obvious as the ebh scheme and the requirements for the baffle are higher therefore the ubh scheme proposed in this paper has a better suppression effect on tank sloshing under certain conditions 4 3 wave height this chapter quantitatively analyzes the suppression effect of the number and height distribution of baffles by comparing the wave height in the tank the effects of different external excitation frequencies different baffle numbers and different baffle height distribution schemes on the wave height are compared first we compared the baffle height distribution schemes with gradient of 0 2 0 0 45 each scheme excites the tank with external frequencies of 0 5 hz 0 7 hz 0 9 hz 1 1 hz and 1 3 hz in addition the water depth h w 80 m m the average baffle height h b 40 m m and the external excitation amplitude a e 15 m m the wave height contrast is shown in fig 18 it can be seen from fig 18 that when the gradient k 0 and k 0 45 the tank sloshes more violent when the external excitation near 0 7 hz the amplitude of wave height decreases with the increase of external excitation frequency when the gradient k 0 2 the liquid in the tank sloshes more violent when the external excitation near 0 9 hz it shows that although the total height of the baffle in the tank is the same different height allocations will also affect the natural frequency of the liquid in the tank at the same time under the condition of the same external excitation frequency the baffle height allocation scheme of k 0 45 has the smallest wave height which has a better suppression effect on tank sloshing the comparisons of the influence of different baffle height gradient on the wave height is shown in fig 19 in addition the suppression effect of different baffle number ebh scheme on tank sloshing is also compared by comparing the different numbers of equal height baffles on the ordinate axis it can be seen that the suppression effect on tank sloshing is the better when there are more baffles although increasing the number of baffles can suppress tank sloshing better as the number of baffles increases the optimization effect becomes weaker and weaker when there are five baffles and their total height is the same different baffle height allocations also have a certain impact on the wave height as the gradient of the baffle height increases the wave height of the liquid in the tank decreases gradually to reduce the wave height the condition of k 0 6 has the best suppression effect but considering the stress and structure of the middle baffle this extreme condition is not considered when the gradient of the baffle height is negative although the wave height is slightly higher than 5 baffles ebh scheme it is still lower than the case of 3 baffles ebh scheme it can be seen that the number of baffles or the total height of the baffles effect the sloshing phenomena more 4 4 hydrodynamic force in addition to the adverse effects of tank sloshing on the stability of the ship the violent impact pressure may also damage the bulkhead if the bulkhead is damaged the liquid in the tank will flow out and the pressure in the tank will decrease at the same time the overflow of the lng vaporization will be dangerous therefore this section compares the impulse pressure and non pulse pressure on the bulkhead during the sloshing process we compare and analysis the average hydrodynamic force on the right side wall of the tank 5 baffles and without baffle it can be seen from fig 20 that after the external excitation is applied the bulkhead will be subjected to a large impulse pressure in a short duration as time increases this impulsive pressure disappears and the bulkhead is subjected to periodic non pulse pressure with small amplitude by comparing the two figures in fig 20 a b it is obvious that the baffles can restrain hydrodynamic force on the bulkhead the hydrodynamic force on bulkhead of the tank without baffle starts to stabilize after 20s while the tank with 5 baffles stabilizes in about 5s and the pulse pressure duration is shorter moreover the amplitude of the non pulse pressure on the side wall of the tank with the baffles is significantly lower than the tank without baffle it also proves the baffle s effect on controlling the tank sloshing we compare the average hydrodynamic force on the bulkhead under different baffle height gradient schemes fig 21 a compares the cases that the height of the baffle increases decreases and fixed from both sides to the center it can be seen that the hydrodynamic force on the bulkhead in ubh scheme is lower than the ebh scheme when the baffle height decreases from both sides to the center the height of the baffle which is close to the bulkhead is too high and a small part of the fluid is separated between this baffle and the bulkhead the hydrodynamic force on the bulkhead is very small because this separated fluid is the only thing that affects the hydrodynamic force on the bulkhead however the other side of the baffle is impacted by most of the liquid from the middle and the hydrodynamic force is relatively high so this distribution scheme does not meet the actual needs in general the distribution scheme of increasing baffle height from both sides to the center is more effective therefore in fig 21 b we compare the influence of different baffle height gradient k on bulkhead hydrodynamic force it can be seen that the average hydrodynamic force on the bulkhead is the smallest under the condition of the baffle height gradient k 0 45 finally we set the liquid height of 50 mm 25 80 mm 40 100 mm 50 120 mm 60 160 mm 80 respectively and the height of the five baffles is 40 mm then we compare the average hydrodynamic force of the bulkhead under different filling conditions the observed variables are the peak value of the impulse pressure and non pulse pressure it can be seen from fig 22 that with the increase of the liquid height in the tank the impulse pressure and non pulse pressure on the bulkhead gradually increase at this time there is a dangerous loading condition in the interval of 60 80 of the liquid loading rate the average hydrodynamic force on the bulkhead is relatively high and it is in a relatively dangerous state the specific dangerous load condition needs a dynamic load rate simulation for analysis which can be researched in the future work through the comparison of various parameters in this section it can be seen that increasing the number and height of baffles can inhibit tank sloshing better under the same number of baffles and the total height of the baffles the ubh scheme of a certain gradient has better performance than the ebh scheme 5 conclusion this paper studies the effect of baffles with different parameters on the controlling of the tank sloshing we compare the wave height spectral density bulkhead hydrodynamic force and flow velocity vector of the liquid in the tank under the different number of baffles the liquid loading rate external excitation frequency conditions in the numerical simulation of tank sloshing by adjusting the parameters of the k ε model the deformation at peak of the wave height in the tank was simulated to make it more in line with the actual situation at the same time this paper also derives the numerical relationship between the liquid height and the wave height so as to obtain the data of the wave height in the tank by measuring the surface elevation directly finally we propose an ubh scheme and compare it with the ebh scheme with the same total baffle height and number by setting different baffle height gradient the suppression effects of different height allocation schemes on tank sloshing are compared numerical simulation results show that under certain load conditions the ubh scheme with proper baffle height gradient has a better suppression effect on the tank sloshing process in addition the scheme that height of the baffle decreases from sides to the center and the scheme with a large positive gradient is usually not adopted due to stress and structural reasons this article only gives a certain reference range for the dangerous load condition of the liquid in the tank the specific value of the dangerous load and the dangerous load under different conditions need to be studied later at the same time the optimal baffle height gradient under different load conditions is also a question worth exploring we will give a research in the future work credit authorship contribution statement yu ying tang conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft

underground tank and floating storage this study presents an underwater energy storage accumulator concept and investigates the hydrodynamic characteristics of a full scale 1000 m3 accumulator under different flow conditions numerical simulations are carried out using an les turbulence model time averaged and transient flow structures and force characteristics are analyzed the results show that the vortex structures are complex and scale rich but periodic vortex shedding can still be identified the shedding frequency is consistent with the fluctuation of the lift force in the cross flow direction a dominant strouhal number of 0 18 is found the mean drag and lift coefficients stabilize at 0 45 and 0 60 respectively and are insensitive to reynolds number variation modal analysis shows that the natural frequency of the accumulator falls between 27 and 48 hz and is much higher than the vortex shedding frequency thus for the accumulator model investigated in this study the risk of vortex induced vibration viv fatigue damage is very low keywords les cfd energy storage underwater vortex 1 introduction environmental and climate issues are creating driving forces for cleaner energy infrastructure in 2020 covid 19 has forced many countries into lockdown recent studies have shown that the coronavirus lockdown has contributed to some degree of environmental and ecological recoveries there is little doubt that this disaster will have a significant impact on our long view of energy development arora et al 2020 gillingham et al 2020 although carbon intensive fossil energy is anticipated to be indispensable in the short to medium time horizon cleaner and even zero polluting sustainable clean energy has been booming and is playing an increasingly significant role in the global energy mosaic day et al 2015 u s energy information administration 2020 whether its carbon based fuels crude oil natural gas etc hydrogen based fuels hydrogen ammonia etc or renewable energy wind solar wave current etc energy storage particularly large scale storage remains a critical link connecting production and utilization in terms of large scale carbon based fuels oil and natural gas energy storage there are generally three approaches commonly utilized underground storage aboveground tank storage and floating storage for shallow water hydrocarbon production produced hydrocarbon is usually transported by a seabed pipeline system and subsequently stored in surface tanks and underground reservoirs the seabed pipeline system guarantees continuous production regardless of bad weather and rough sea conditions thereby improving economic performance for deepwater and ultra deepwater hydrocarbon production a seabed pipeline system is no longer preferred due to the extremely high cost choi and chang 2016 here the floating production storage and offloading fpso system is widely used for better economic production shuttle tankers transport the hydrocarbon from fpso to onshore storage operations under rough sea conditions however critical safety issues related to the hydrodynamic performance of large hull fpso start to emerge and production delays can be caused by the unavailability of the shuttle tankers choi and chang 2016 ji et al 2019 in recent years in coastal cities where the land resources are lacking and the population is high density floating storage facilities have been developed to replace onshore storage tanks for example two floating fuel storage facilities have been successfully deployed at shirashima island and kamigoto island in japan and a modular floating hydrocarbon storage facility fhsf concept has been developed in singapore wan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 for these floating storage facilities the hydrodynamic response remains a critical factor for global design especially under rough sea conditions further the impact on marine traffic and aquaculture should also be considered energy storage is also a valuable enabler for furthering renewable energy kittner et al 2017 currently there are various energy storage technologies including and not limited to phs pumped hydro storage caes compressed air energy storage bes battery energy storage fes flywheel energy storage tes thermal energy storage p2g power to gas energy storage electromagnetic energy storage ges gravity energy storage byes buoyancy energy storage and sces super capacitor energy storage wang et al 2019a in terms of large scale energy storage phs is the most mature subsequently it represents more than 90 of storage worldwide phs takes advantage of the potential energy of water with different elevations i e energy to be stored lifts water to a higher elevation and the energy is discharged when the water returns to the lower elevation there are many different methods to achieve phs by creating an altitude difference generally water storage reservoirs can be deployed either on mountains or underground however drawbacks of phs are becoming increasingly evident such as ecologic and environmental issues population displacement and soaring investment costs etc kong et al 2017 some novel concepts have been proposed to overcome these disadvantages such as the floating phs based on very large floating structures vlfs klar et al 2018 in recent years caes has been regarded as an alternative to large scale phs and many projects have been successfully developed and under construction worldwide in caes systems high pressure compressed air is a carrier used to store energy generally compressed air is stored in underground reservoirs and aboveground tanks this is very similar to power to gas energy storage the difference is that hydrogen and synthetic methane are utilized as energy carriers rather than compressed air currently hydrogen energy storage is largely taking place as small scale experiments and controlled demonstrations while large scale storage is still quite conceptual ozarslan 2012 zanuttigh et al 2016 overall many challenges need to be overcome particularly low efficiencies and high costs huo et al 2016 that said hydrogen energy is still one of the most promising clean energies which have the potential to be a significant contributor to future sustainable energy infrastructure in recent years underwater energy storage has received a lot of attention as an alternative to the aforementioned conventional solutions slocum et al 2013 wang et al 2019c compared with other large scale storage approaches underwater storage has many advantages firstly for deepwater offshore oil gas production continuous production can be guaranteed regardless of bad weather and rough sea conditions secondly larger hydrocarbon storage capacity can be achieved with potentially less operation and maintenance costs thirdly fewer emissions will be produced than floating storage facilities fourthly valuable land resources can be conserved while the marine traffic and aquaculture will be less affected therefore underwater energy storage is suitable for offshore islands and coastal cities fifthly the explosion hazard in floating storage facilities and aboveground storage tanks can be avoided sixthly with the rapid development of marine renewable energy underwater energy storage can be easily integrated with marine renewable energy farms and serve the energy hungry coastal regions that possess intensive industrial commercial and human activities finally in some cases the hydrostatic pressure of deep water can be utilized to form isobaric storage of fluid energy carriers despite the advantages there are still many challenges that must be overcome to accelerate the commercial success of underwater energy storage a better understanding of the hydrodynamic characteristics maintainability reliability availability deployment economic potential etc is needed the objective of this study is to investigate the hydrodynamics of a full scale underwater energy storage accumulator at a constant current flow velocity therefore providing a reference for identifying the risk of flow induced vibration this paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a brief literature review on underwater energy storage concepts and related research and the underwater energy storage accumulator model is described afterward the physical parameters used in this study are defined and the fundamentals of les turbulence model are introduced in section 3 in section 4 the cfd model and the detailed setup of the numerical simulation are introduced and the reliability of the numerical model is verified following this the results including time averaged and transient flow characteristics force characteristics and modal analysis are presented and discussed in section 5 finally in section 6 conclusions are made 2 underwater energy storage concept and accumulator 2 1 underwater energy storage concept underwater energy storage is not a new concept the first underwater oil storage concept was designed in the 1960s hanna 1963 while the concept of underwater gas energy storage was first proposed in the 1990s wang et al 2019a the principle of underwater energy storage is quite straightforward fluid energy carriers oil natural gas hydrogen compressed air tend to separate with water and form an interface due to the density difference accumulators containers are needed to constrain the fluid energy carriers with the increasing maturity of ocean engineering technologies the rapid development of the offshore oil gas industry and the increasing demand for marine renewable energy and energy storage underwater energy storage technology has revived in recent years fig 1 summarizes possible application modes of underwater energy storage first shown as underwater energy storage accumulator 1 in fig 1 it can be integrated with an offshore oil gas production system to supply adequate storage capacity regardless of weather conditions there are plenty of underwater oil storage concepts that have been proposed stafford et al 1972 toyama 1974 most recently choi and chang 2016 designed a subsea production system concept with an underwater storage tank to provide an alternative to conventional floating facilities they performed reliability maintainability and availability study for the underwater storage tank the results showed that the system availability under normal operation was about 91 8 the economic feasibility of underwater storage was further proven by kim et al 2017 in 2014 a subsea oil storage tank with a storage capacity of 48 000 m³ was successfully installed and operated in the solan field as shown in fig 2 a velema and bokhorst 2015 wheaton et al 2017 kongsberg oil gas developed a large scale underwater oil storage unit with a capacity of 20 000 m³ and successfully tested a pilot model fig 2 b in 2015 olsson 2016 a flexible bag was introduced inside the protective rigid structure such that the oil and seawater could be separated and emulsion and pollution could be avoided secondly shown as underwater energy storage accumulator 2 in fig 1 it is revealed how it can be integrated with an offshore renewable energy farm where many concepts have been proposed to store compressed air hydrogen and water slocum et al 2013 proposed an underwater phs concept with the hollow sphere structure and water as the energy carrier for storing marine renewable energy this concept was further developed by fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy system technology in 2017 as shown in fig 2 c a small scale pilot prototype was successfully tested in lake constance at a depth of 100 m with a 3 m diameter concrete sphere storage tank puchta et al 2017 hahn et al 2017 conducted a techno economic assessment on the underwater phs for power balancing services and found that it was cost competitive in an underwater compressed air energy storage uwcaes system the compressed air stored in deepwater accumulators is used as the energy carrier isobaric storage can be achieved by taking advantage of hydrostatic pressure thereby contributing to higher round trip energy efficiency than traditional isochoric caes many studies have been conducted to investigate the feasibility and advantages of integrating uwcaes with marine renewable energy a detailed review of uwcaes can be found in wang et al 2019a as shown in fig 2 d pimm et al 2014 designed a balloon shaped flexible energy bag and tested it in seawater at the european marine energy centre in orkney hydrostor inc learning from the lift bags widely utilized in ocean engineering tested two types of flexible air accumulators as shown in fig 2 e and f they successfully built and operated the world s first grid connected uwcaes system in toronto island by the end of 2015 these flexible energy storage accumulators showed acceptable performance in experimental and pilot systems although fluid dynamics of a variety of bluff bodies and offshore structures have been widely investigated there is a dearth of research on large scale underwater energy storage accumulators lim et al 2012 designed a square frustum shaped underwater compressed air storage accumulator made of concrete with an interior volume of 903 m3 to investigate the periodic loading caused by ocean currents and to develop an adequate anchoring system they conducted a preliminary cfd simulation using a rans k ε model the result showed that the accumulator could be stably deployed on the seabed without additional ballast vasel be hagh et al 2013 2015 and wang et al 2018 2019b conducted detailed cfd studies and experiments on flow structures and force characteristics of small scale balloon shaped underwater air accumulators at different reynolds numbers ranging from 3 103 to 2 3 105 the results revealed that the standard k ω and k ω sst turbulence models could appropriately predict the time averaged hydrodynamic characteristics but failed to capture the transient turbulence nature and the force fluctuation these details were more likely to be captured by an les turbulence model that could potentially reveal both the time averaged results and the transient results hu et al 2019 designed a riser structure and investigated the feasibility of utilization in the uwcaes system combining the advantage of underwater phs and underwater caes sant et al 2018 proposed and tested an underwater hydro pneumatic accumulator concept with floating offshore wind turbines for achieving higher energy efficiency and better economic performance buhagiar et al 2019 because of the similar physical gas properties with compressed air hydrogen can also be compressed and stored underwater technipfmc launched a plan named deep purple with partners for storing intermittent floating offshore wind energy with underwater hydrogen storage løver 2019 finally shown as underwater energy storage accumulator 3 in fig 1 nearshore underwater energy storage can also be used to compensate or even replace onshore tank storage and underground storage where land resources are limited it is clear that underwater energy storage can be extensively integrated with offshore and nearshore energy activities for this reason more and more industrial developers are investigating in this field 2 2 accumulator model the accumulator is a critical component in underwater energy storage systems generally it can be divided into two categories rigid and flexible the advantages of each rigid and flexible accumulator can form a complementary relationship thus by combining the advantages of rigid and flexible it is possible to develop a general underwater accumulator concept for storing all kinds of fluid energy carriers with lower density than seawater a schematic diagram of the general accumulator concept is shown in fig 3 the accumulator is composed of a rigid shell outside and a flexible storage bag inside the rigid shell is made of reinforced concrete to protect the inside flexible storage bag and endure the hydrodynamic effects of the ocean current protected by the rigid shell leakage and pollution will be avoided in case the flexible bag is damaged besides together with the foundation support it can serve as the ballast the flexible storage bag is made of high strength fabric and rubber material and is used to store the fluid energy carriers while avoiding direct contact between seawater and stored fluid the top cover unit is strategically designed to be plug and play with the help of an rov remote operated vehicle the flexible storage bag is connected with the top cover unit as a result the flexible bag can be easily removed and replaced in case it is broken seawater can flow in and out of the space between the rigid shell and flexible bag through the seawater vents at the lower position of the rigid shell the pressure of the stored fluid energy carrier is always equal to the hydrostatic pressure of the surrounding seawater thus the whole accumulator is not a pressure vessel that needs to sustain a large pressure difference to facilitate the construction deployment ballast and recycling potential the storage volume of a single accumulator is kept relatively small which may also improve the reliability of the entire underwater storage array flexible storage capacity can be achieved by means of a proper piping network that will connect multiple accumulators in series and or parallel arrangements fig 4 shows the basic working processes of this underwater accumulator during the charging process the fluid energy carrier is pumped into the flexible storage bag the shape of the flexible bag changes along with the volume of the stored fluid energy carrier the seawater in the space between the rigid shell and flexible bag is expelled from the accumulator during the constant pressure charging process the seawater flows back into the accumulator during the discharge as the stored fluid is released although the underwater accumulator is not vulnerable to rough waves it is subjected to flow induced vibration caused by the ocean current thus it is necessary to investigate the hydrostatic performance of underwater accumulators under different flow conditions in this study the hydrodynamic characteristics of an accumulator with a storage capacity of about 1000 m³ are investigated at different reynolds numbers 3 fundamentals and definitions in this section several basic physical parameters used for analyses are defined and fundamentals of les turbulence model are briefly introduced 3 1 definitions of physical parameters the reynolds number is defined by 1 r e ρ u d μ where ρ is the density of seawater u is the free stream velocity d is the characteristic length and μ is the dynamic viscosity of seawater in this study the density of seawater is set as 1 025 103 kg m3 a mean temperature of 4 c in deep water is selected and the corresponding dynamic viscosity is calculated by the following equation 2 μ μ 0 1 0 0337 t 0 000221 t 2 where μ 0 1 79 10 3 pa s is the dynamic viscosity of seawater when the temperature is 0 c thus the dynamic viscosity at 4 c is 1 572 10 3 pa s the non dimensional wall distance y is defined as 3 y u τ y ν where u τ τ w ρ is the friction velocity in which τ w and ρ are wall shear stress and density of the fluid respectively and y is the wall normal distance the lift coefficient c l and the drag coefficient c d are deduced by equation 4 and equation 5 respectively 4 c l f l 0 5 ρ u 2 s l 5 c d f d 0 5 ρ u 2 s d where f l and f d are lift force and drag force respectively s l and s d are projected area of the accumulator in the directions of lift force and drag force respectively the q criterion the second invariant of the velocity gradient is used to identify the vortex cores dubief and delcayre 2000 hunt et al 1988 it is defined by 6 q 0 5 ω 2 s 2 where ω and s represent the anti symmetric and symmetric components of the velocity gradient tensor respectively the non dimensional frequency strouhal number is calculated by 7 s t d f u where f is the frequency u is the free stream velocity and d is the characteristic diameter 3 2 turbulence model and governing equations numerical and experimental studies on flow around cylindrical bluff bodies have been widely investigated these investigations generally reveal that the les turbulence model tends to be stabler and more accurate than the rans turbulence model benhamadouche and laurence 2003 ke 2019 su et al 2013 this situation is easier to observe when the free end effect is considered palau salvador et al 2010 sumner 2013 according to authors previous numerical and experimental studies on flow over underwater energy storage accumulators at sub critical reynolds numbers vasel be hagh et al 2013 vasel be hagh et al 2015 wang 2018 wang et al 2019b wang 2020 it was concluded that the standard k ω and k ω sst turbulence models could appropriately predict the time averaged hydrodynamic characteristics but failed to capture the transient turbulence nature and the force fluctuation while the les turbulence model could potentially reveal both the time averaged results and the transient results in this study reynolds numbers are in the super critical and trans critical regimes and the free end effect is significant thus an les turbulence model is adopted for numerical simulations here the well tested smagorinsky lilly model for les is applied to the navier stokes equations of incompressible flow the filtered governing equations are written as follows 8 u i x i 0 9 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j τ i j x j where u p and ρ are velocity pressure and density respectively and τ i j is the sub grid scale stress which in the smagorinsky lilly model is determined as yagmur et al 2020 10 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 μ t s i j 11 μ t c s δ 2 s 12 s 2 s i j s i j 1 2 13 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i where μ t is the eddy viscosity δ i j is kronecker delta s i j is the filtered rate of strain tensor δ is the filter scale and c s is smagorinsky parameter and set as a constant value of 0 1 in this study 4 numerical simulations the modeling and simulation details are presented in this section the computational domain and boundary conditions are presented first then the mesh generation and independence analysis the model solving methods and solution monitoring setting are presented afterward the model verification is discussed 4 1 simplified model of accumulator to decrease computational expenses and obtain universal results the details of the accumulator are neglected and the accumulator is simplified to a cylindrical tank with a dome the dimensions of the accumulator model used in this study are as shown in fig 5 4 2 computational domain and boundary conditions fig 6 depicts the computational domain and boundary conditions used for cfd simulations in this study the diameter of the cylindrical accumulator d is used as the characteristic length to define the reynolds number and it is also used as the unit length for positioning in the coordinate system x y and z axes represent the flow direction vertical direction and cross flow direction respectively the bottom of the accumulator model is centered at 5d 0 0 uniform velocity profile is prescribed as dirichlet boundary condition at the inlet boundary outflow boundary condition with a flow rate weighting of 1 is used at the outlet of the computational domain slip wall condition is utilized on the top and side boundaries the bottom and accumulator walls are both set as no slip wall conditions in the flow direction the blockage ratio is about 4 6 and thus the effect of top and sidewalls on the flow field can be neglected as shown in table 1 four different current flow conditions are investigated in this study 4 3 mesh generation and independence fig 7 shows different views of the generated mesh due to the relatively regular shape of the accumulator model a structured mesh is employed and the computational domain is divided into 34 blocks in order to accurately capture the hydrodynamic characteristics of the accumulator model the mesh close to the no slip walls is refined and modified according to the non dimensional wall distance y ranging from 1 to 10 in the wall modeled les to ensure the accuracy of calculations and reduce the computational cost mesh independence analyses are carried out the drag coefficient in the flow direction and lift coefficient in the vertical direction are used as criteria to evaluate the mesh independence fig 8 shows the relationship between force coefficients and the number of cells when the inlet flow velocity is 1 m s the force coefficients converge to a constant value once the number of cells exceeds 2 07 million at this point the relative errors of the drag coefficient and lift coefficient are about 1 1 and 0 9 respectively thus the mesh with 2 2 million cells is used to conduct les simulations for the flow conditions u 0 5 and u 1 in this study similarly a coarse mesh independence analysis is conducted for the flow conditions u 5 and the mesh independence is obtained with 5 million cells thus for the flow conditions u 3 and u 5 the mesh with 5 million cells is used 4 4 model solving in this study the simplec algorithm is employed for the pressure velocity coupling scheme in spatial discretization to minimize numerical diffusion the gradient is set as least squares cell based and pressure is set as the second order while bounded central differencing is chosen for momentum interpolation for the transient formulation the bounded second order implicit scheme is adopted convergences at 1 10 5 for the scaled residual are set a time step of δ t 1 10 3 s is chosen for all flow conditions according to the cfl condition u δ t δ x 1 where δ x is the size of the control volume 4 5 solution monitoring for revealing the flow structures different monitoring lines and panels are set as shown in fig 9 including five lines x1 x2 x3 y1 and z1 and five panels xoy xoz yoz1 yoz2 and yoz3 turbulent velocity parameters are monitored on these lines and panels for analyzing the hydrostatic force characteristics of the accumulator model the drag force in the x axis direction and lift forces in y axis and z axis directions are monitored 4 6 model verification in order to verify the reliability of the numerical model and the accuracy of the results the mean drag coefficient and strouhal number of this study are compared with numerical and experimental results from different sources in the open literature figs 10 and 11 show the comparisons of the mean drag coefficient and strouhal number respectively overall the hydrodynamic parameters are almost constant in sub critical and trans critical regimes due to the stable boundary layer and periodic vortex shedding however the drag crisis and complex vortex shedding present in the critical and super critical regimes due to the turbulent transition of laminar boundary layer there is relatively little available data in the trans critical regime with high reynolds numbers nevertheless the results of this study are consistent with the extrapolated trends of the literature from fig 10 it is obvious that the mean drag coefficients of the underwater energy storage accumulator model are between the infinite smooth circular cylinder and the smooth sphere this is due to the in between shape of the accumulator model between a cylinder and a sphere the mean drag coefficients of this study match up well with the results of schewe 1983 while much lower than that of van hinsberg et al 2014 this can be attributed to the fact that the results were based on the rough circular cylinder and the free end effect was not considered in van hinsberg et al 2014 from fig 11 it is clear that the strouhal number of this study is very close to the experimental results of schewe 1983 and van hinsberg et al 2014 subsequently we consider our numerical model and results largely reliable 5 results and discussion in this section the flow structures and force characteristics of the accumulator at various reynolds numbers including the time averaged and transient results are presented and discussed beyond this a modal analysis is conducted to calculate the natural frequency of the designed accumulator 5 1 time averaged flow characteristics the time averaged flow characteristics at various monitoring lines and panels are presented in figs 12 18 similar flow structures are revealed under four different current flow conditions which is consistent with the results observed in previous studies at lower reynolds numbers gonçalves et al 2015 palau salvador et al 2010 rinoshika et al 2021 sumner 2013 in this study u v and w represent the velocity components along x y and z axes respectively the velocity is non dimensional to enable the comparison of the results to various flow conditions fig 12 shows profiles of non dimensional time averaged velocity component u along different monitoring lines x1 x2 and x3 at various inlet velocities u 0 5 u 1 u 3 and u 5 in the flow direction the velocity decreases to zero just ahead of the accumulator and it recovers to the steady state value in the far wake it is worth noting that the negative velocity manifests in the near wake behind the accumulator this signifies flow recirculation behind the accumulator with the increase of height from x1 to x3 the peak value of u u n increases and the length of the recirculation zone decreases this is more expected in figs 13 and 14 in the xoz panel a pair of counter rotating symmetrical vortices are observed in the xoy panel a clockwise rotating vortex becomes visible fig 15 shows profiles of non dimensional time averaged velocity component v along different monitoring lines x1 x2 and x3 at various inlet velocities u 0 5 u 1 u 3 and u 5 due to the boundary layer separation and downwash recirculation the velocity component v fluctuates in the near wake behind the accumulator the downwash recirculation in fig 14 is caused by the end effect of the top dome due to the synergy of flows around the dome and sides of the accumulator a pair of counter rotating symmetrical vortices is observed in the yoz panel as shown in fig 16 these trailing vertical structures are also observed in other studies sumner 2013 fig 17 shows profiles of non dimensional time averaged velocity component v along monitoring line y1 at various inlet velocities it is clear that velocity component v is roughly parabolic correlated to the height of the accumulator and the maximum values of v appear in the range of 0 4h 0 6h i e the middle height of the accumulator fig 18 shows the profiles of the non dimensional time averaged velocity component w along monitoring line z1 at various inlet velocities the profiles are inversely symmetrical due to the counter rotating trailing vortices 5 2 transient flow characteristics in this study the evolution of the velocity field and vortex cores are used to analyze transient flow characteristics herein the q criterion is used to identify the vortex cores fig 19 shows the q criterion iso surfaces of 1 5 around the accumulator at 1505 s when the inlet velocity is 0 5 m s the horseshoe vortex at the foot of the accumulator and complex vortex shedding behind the accumulator are clearly shown the vortices downstream of the accumulator are quite twisted and scale rich fig 20 shows the time evolution of the flow pattern downstream of the accumulator at the monitoring panel yoz1 the developments of the velocity field and vortices are very complex it is not easy to identify the prominently regular flow pattern in panel yoz1 as the turbulent flow decays the relatively regular flow patterns become more identifiable in panel yoz3 as shown in fig 21 from fig 21 the alternate shedding vortices behind both sides of the accumulator can be observed for detecting regular vortex shedding a specific flow pattern is identified as shown in fig 22 a and the appearance time interval of this pattern between 2 000 s and 3 600 s is presented in fig 22 b when the inlet velocity is 0 5 m s the average time interval is about 103 s 5 3 force characteristics fig 23 shows the time history of the drag coefficient in the flow direction and the lift coefficient in the vertical direction of the accumulator under different flow conditions it is clear that the force coefficients fluctuate around stable values due to the vortex shedding the frequency of fluctuation increases with the increasing flow velocity the mean values of force coefficients under different flow conditions are summarized in table 2 interestingly the drag and lift coefficients remain nearly stabilized at 0 45 and 0 60 respectively as flow condition varies all situations investigated in this study are in the self stimulated domain where the dimensionless drag coefficients almost do not change with increasing reynolds number fig 24 shows the time history of the lift coefficient in the cross flow direction of the accumulator under the flow condition of u 0 5 the periodic fluctuation of lift force in cross flow direction caused by the alternant vortex shedding around the sides of the accumulator is a significant potential factor that could result in viv fatigue damage the strouhal number is used to present the frequency characteristic of lift force invoking fourier transform the st amplitude diagram is obtained as shown in fig 25 the strouhal number falls between 0 1 and 0 3 some peaks are observed in this range indicating the dominant frequencies in which the vortices are shed from the accumulator this is consistent with the time interval of the identified specific flow pattern shown in fig 22 in fig 25 a dominant peak at st 0 18 can be observed which corresponds to a period of vortex shedding of 110s when the inlet flow velocity is 0 5 m s this peak represents the periodic shedding of the vortex with maximum energy similarly the peak strouhal numbers of flow conditions u 1 u 3 and u 5 are found to be 0 18 0 19 and 0 17 respectively the corresponding frequencies of four flow conditions are about 0 01 hz 0 018 hz 0 057 hz and 0 085 hz respectively thus even if the flow velocity reaches a high value of 5 m s the dominant frequency of vortex shedding remains lower than 0 1 hz the result can be used to compare with the natural frequency of accumulators for identifying the possibility of viv fatigue damage 5 4 modal analysis modal analysis is conducted using the finite element method with ansys software for calculating the natural frequency of the designed accumulator the first six order modal parameters are obtained table 3 shows the natural frequency of the first six order modes of full scale reinforced concrete accumulator model table 4 shows the material parameters of the reinforced concrete accumulator fig 26 shows the first six order vibration mode shape for a full scale accumulator it is evident that the natural frequency of the first six order modes falls in the range of 27 48 hz which is much higher than the dominant frequency of vortex shedding thus for the designed accumulator model in this study the risk of viv fatigue damage is very low 6 conclusions the energy accumulator is a critical component in underwater energy storage systems in this study the hydrodynamic characteristics of a full scale accumulator are investigated using les with smagorinsky lilly subgrid scale model numerical simulations under four different flow conditions with reynolds number range from 3 106 to 3 107 are conducted the major findings of the study are summarized as follows by analyzing the time averaged flow characteristics similar flow structures that are commonly observed in the flow around finite wall mounted and free ended cylinders are also presented in the near wake of the energy accumulator model the free end effect of the top dome results in the downwash recirculation and a pair of counter rotating symmetrical trailing vortices by comparing the non dimensional velocity components similar flow structures are revealed under four different flow conditions the existence of the recirculation zone and downwash trailing vortex may intensify the local scour around the accumulator therefore the skirted foundation support structure should be strategically designed with the local scour effect considered in the future manes and brocchini 2015 yao et al 2020 the twisted and scale rich transient vortex structures are found downstream of the accumulator periodic vortex shedding is still evident despite this the frequency of vortex shedding is consistent with the fluctuation of the lift force in the cross flow direction of the accumulator when the inlet flow velocity is 0 5 m s the period of dominant vortex shedding is about 103 s which corresponds to a strouhal number of 0 18 approximately equal strouhal numbers are also found under other flow conditions analyzing the force characteristics reveals the mean drag coefficient stabilizes at 0 45 while the frequency of fluctuating transient drag force increases with an increasing reynolds number the lift coefficients in the vertical direction and horizontal direction fluctuate around 0 60 and 0 respectively the dominating frequencies of lift force in four flow conditions are about 0 01 hz 0 018 hz 0 057 hz and 0 085 hz respectively this provides a useful reference for evaluating the hydrodynamic stability of large scale underwater energy accumulators the modal analysis shows that the first 6 natural frequency modes of the reinforced concrete accumulator are between 27 hz and 48 hz which is much lower than the dominant vortex shedding frequency presented via cfd analysis thus for the accumulator model in this study the risk of viv fatigue damage is very low nevertheless the natural frequency will change if the materials scale structure and storage rate of accumulator change thus a comprehensive modal analysis should always follow any design modifications beyond this the reliability and maintainability associated with biofouling could be a critical issue for achieving continuous maintenance free operation in the long run this study presents a fundamental investigation of the hydrodynamics of a large scale underwater energy storage accumulator it could provide an enabling reference for interested researchers and groups in the field of underwater energy storage credit authorship contribution statement zhiwen wang

underground tank and floating storage this study presents an underwater energy storage accumulator concept and investigates the hydrodynamic characteristics of a full scale 1000 m3 accumulator under different flow conditions numerical simulations are carried out using an les turbulence model time averaged and transient flow structures and force characteristics are analyzed the results show that the vortex structures are complex and scale rich but periodic vortex shedding can still be identified the shedding frequency is consistent with the fluctuation of the lift force in the cross flow direction a dominant strouhal number of 0 18 is found the mean drag and lift coefficients stabilize at 0 45 and 0 60 respectively and are insensitive to reynolds number variation modal analysis shows that the natural frequency of the accumulator falls between 27 and 48 hz and is much higher than the vortex shedding frequency thus for the accumulator model investigated in this study the risk of vortex induced vibration viv fatigue damage is very low keywords les cfd energy storage underwater vortex 1 introduction environmental and climate issues are creating driving forces for cleaner energy infrastructure in 2020 covid 19 has forced many countries into lockdown recent studies have shown that the coronavirus lockdown has contributed to some degree of environmental and ecological recoveries there is little doubt that this disaster will have a significant impact on our long view of energy development arora et al 2020 gillingham et al 2020 although carbon intensive fossil energy is anticipated to be indispensable in the short to medium time horizon cleaner and even zero polluting sustainable clean energy has been booming and is playing an increasingly significant role in the global energy mosaic day et al 2015 u s energy information administration 2020 whether its carbon based fuels crude oil natural gas etc hydrogen based fuels hydrogen ammonia etc or renewable energy wind solar wave current etc energy storage particularly large scale storage remains a critical link connecting production and utilization in terms of large scale carbon based fuels oil and natural gas energy storage there are generally three approaches commonly utilized underground storage aboveground tank storage and floating storage for shallow water hydrocarbon production produced hydrocarbon is usually transported by a seabed pipeline system and subsequently stored in surface tanks and underground reservoirs the seabed pipeline system guarantees continuous production regardless of bad weather and rough sea conditions thereby improving economic performance for deepwater and ultra deepwater hydrocarbon production a seabed pipeline system is no longer preferred due to the extremely high cost choi and chang 2016 here the floating production storage and offloading fpso system is widely used for better economic production shuttle tankers transport the hydrocarbon from fpso to onshore storage operations under rough sea conditions however critical safety issues related to the hydrodynamic performance of large hull fpso start to emerge and production delays can be caused by the unavailability of the shuttle tankers choi and chang 2016 ji et al 2019 in recent years in coastal cities where the land resources are lacking and the population is high density floating storage facilities have been developed to replace onshore storage tanks for example two floating fuel storage facilities have been successfully deployed at shirashima island and kamigoto island in japan and a modular floating hydrocarbon storage facility fhsf concept has been developed in singapore wan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 for these floating storage facilities the hydrodynamic response remains a critical factor for global design especially under rough sea conditions further the impact on marine traffic and aquaculture should also be considered energy storage is also a valuable enabler for furthering renewable energy kittner et al 2017 currently there are various energy storage technologies including and not limited to phs pumped hydro storage caes compressed air energy storage bes battery energy storage fes flywheel energy storage tes thermal energy storage p2g power to gas energy storage electromagnetic energy storage ges gravity energy storage byes buoyancy energy storage and sces super capacitor energy storage wang et al 2019a in terms of large scale energy storage phs is the most mature subsequently it represents more than 90 of storage worldwide phs takes advantage of the potential energy of water with different elevations i e energy to be stored lifts water to a higher elevation and the energy is discharged when the water returns to the lower elevation there are many different methods to achieve phs by creating an altitude difference generally water storage reservoirs can be deployed either on mountains or underground however drawbacks of phs are becoming increasingly evident such as ecologic and environmental issues population displacement and soaring investment costs etc kong et al 2017 some novel concepts have been proposed to overcome these disadvantages such as the floating phs based on very large floating structures vlfs klar et al 2018 in recent years caes has been regarded as an alternative to large scale phs and many projects have been successfully developed and under construction worldwide in caes systems high pressure compressed air is a carrier used to store energy generally compressed air is stored in underground reservoirs and aboveground tanks this is very similar to power to gas energy storage the difference is that hydrogen and synthetic methane are utilized as energy carriers rather than compressed air currently hydrogen energy storage is largely taking place as small scale experiments and controlled demonstrations while large scale storage is still quite conceptual ozarslan 2012 zanuttigh et al 2016 overall many challenges need to be overcome particularly low efficiencies and high costs huo et al 2016 that said hydrogen energy is still one of the most promising clean energies which have the potential to be a significant contributor to future sustainable energy infrastructure in recent years underwater energy storage has received a lot of attention as an alternative to the aforementioned conventional solutions slocum et al 2013 wang et al 2019c compared with other large scale storage approaches underwater storage has many advantages firstly for deepwater offshore oil gas production continuous production can be guaranteed regardless of bad weather and rough sea conditions secondly larger hydrocarbon storage capacity can be achieved with potentially less operation and maintenance costs thirdly fewer emissions will be produced than floating storage facilities fourthly valuable land resources can be conserved while the marine traffic and aquaculture will be less affected therefore underwater energy storage is suitable for offshore islands and coastal cities fifthly the explosion hazard in floating storage facilities and aboveground storage tanks can be avoided sixthly with the rapid development of marine renewable energy underwater energy storage can be easily integrated with marine renewable energy farms and serve the energy hungry coastal regions that possess intensive industrial commercial and human activities finally in some cases the hydrostatic pressure of deep water can be utilized to form isobaric storage of fluid energy carriers despite the advantages there are still many challenges that must be overcome to accelerate the commercial success of underwater energy storage a better understanding of the hydrodynamic characteristics maintainability reliability availability deployment economic potential etc is needed the objective of this study is to investigate the hydrodynamics of a full scale underwater energy storage accumulator at a constant current flow velocity therefore providing a reference for identifying the risk of flow induced vibration this paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a brief literature review on underwater energy storage concepts and related research and the underwater energy storage accumulator model is described afterward the physical parameters used in this study are defined and the fundamentals of les turbulence model are introduced in section 3 in section 4 the cfd model and the detailed setup of the numerical simulation are introduced and the reliability of the numerical model is verified following this the results including time averaged and transient flow characteristics force characteristics and modal analysis are presented and discussed in section 5 finally in section 6 conclusions are made 2 underwater energy storage concept and accumulator 2 1 underwater energy storage concept underwater energy storage is not a new concept the first underwater oil storage concept was designed in the 1960s hanna 1963 while the concept of underwater gas energy storage was first proposed in the 1990s wang et al 2019a the principle of underwater energy storage is quite straightforward fluid energy carriers oil natural gas hydrogen compressed air tend to separate with water and form an interface due to the density difference accumulators containers are needed to constrain the fluid energy carriers with the increasing maturity of ocean engineering technologies the rapid development of the offshore oil gas industry and the increasing demand for marine renewable energy and energy storage underwater energy storage technology has revived in recent years fig 1 summarizes possible application modes of underwater energy storage first shown as underwater energy storage accumulator 1 in fig 1 it can be integrated with an offshore oil gas production system to supply adequate storage capacity regardless of weather conditions there are plenty of underwater oil storage concepts that have been proposed stafford et al 1972 toyama 1974 most recently choi and chang 2016 designed a subsea production system concept with an underwater storage tank to provide an alternative to conventional floating facilities they performed reliability maintainability and availability study for the underwater storage tank the results showed that the system availability under normal operation was about 91 8 the economic feasibility of underwater storage was further proven by kim et al 2017 in 2014 a subsea oil storage tank with a storage capacity of 48 000 m³ was successfully installed and operated in the solan field as shown in fig 2 a velema and bokhorst 2015 wheaton et al 2017 kongsberg oil gas developed a large scale underwater oil storage unit with a capacity of 20 000 m³ and successfully tested a pilot model fig 2 b in 2015 olsson 2016 a flexible bag was introduced inside the protective rigid structure such that the oil and seawater could be separated and emulsion and pollution could be avoided secondly shown as underwater energy storage accumulator 2 in fig 1 it is revealed how it can be integrated with an offshore renewable energy farm where many concepts have been proposed to store compressed air hydrogen and water slocum et al 2013 proposed an underwater phs concept with the hollow sphere structure and water as the energy carrier for storing marine renewable energy this concept was further developed by fraunhofer institute for wind energy and energy system technology in 2017 as shown in fig 2 c a small scale pilot prototype was successfully tested in lake constance at a depth of 100 m with a 3 m diameter concrete sphere storage tank puchta et al 2017 hahn et al 2017 conducted a techno economic assessment on the underwater phs for power balancing services and found that it was cost competitive in an underwater compressed air energy storage uwcaes system the compressed air stored in deepwater accumulators is used as the energy carrier isobaric storage can be achieved by taking advantage of hydrostatic pressure thereby contributing to higher round trip energy efficiency than traditional isochoric caes many studies have been conducted to investigate the feasibility and advantages of integrating uwcaes with marine renewable energy a detailed review of uwcaes can be found in wang et al 2019a as shown in fig 2 d pimm et al 2014 designed a balloon shaped flexible energy bag and tested it in seawater at the european marine energy centre in orkney hydrostor inc learning from the lift bags widely utilized in ocean engineering tested two types of flexible air accumulators as shown in fig 2 e and f they successfully built and operated the world s first grid connected uwcaes system in toronto island by the end of 2015 these flexible energy storage accumulators showed acceptable performance in experimental and pilot systems although fluid dynamics of a variety of bluff bodies and offshore structures have been widely investigated there is a dearth of research on large scale underwater energy storage accumulators lim et al 2012 designed a square frustum shaped underwater compressed air storage accumulator made of concrete with an interior volume of 903 m3 to investigate the periodic loading caused by ocean currents and to develop an adequate anchoring system they conducted a preliminary cfd simulation using a rans k ε model the result showed that the accumulator could be stably deployed on the seabed without additional ballast vasel be hagh et al 2013 2015 and wang et al 2018 2019b conducted detailed cfd studies and experiments on flow structures and force characteristics of small scale balloon shaped underwater air accumulators at different reynolds numbers ranging from 3 103 to 2 3 105 the results revealed that the standard k ω and k ω sst turbulence models could appropriately predict the time averaged hydrodynamic characteristics but failed to capture the transient turbulence nature and the force fluctuation these details were more likely to be captured by an les turbulence model that could potentially reveal both the time averaged results and the transient results hu et al 2019 designed a riser structure and investigated the feasibility of utilization in the uwcaes system combining the advantage of underwater phs and underwater caes sant et al 2018 proposed and tested an underwater hydro pneumatic accumulator concept with floating offshore wind turbines for achieving higher energy efficiency and better economic performance buhagiar et al 2019 because of the similar physical gas properties with compressed air hydrogen can also be compressed and stored underwater technipfmc launched a plan named deep purple with partners for storing intermittent floating offshore wind energy with underwater hydrogen storage løver 2019 finally shown as underwater energy storage accumulator 3 in fig 1 nearshore underwater energy storage can also be used to compensate or even replace onshore tank storage and underground storage where land resources are limited it is clear that underwater energy storage can be extensively integrated with offshore and nearshore energy activities for this reason more and more industrial developers are investigating in this field 2 2 accumulator model the accumulator is a critical component in underwater energy storage systems generally it can be divided into two categories rigid and flexible the advantages of each rigid and flexible accumulator can form a complementary relationship thus by combining the advantages of rigid and flexible it is possible to develop a general underwater accumulator concept for storing all kinds of fluid energy carriers with lower density than seawater a schematic diagram of the general accumulator concept is shown in fig 3 the accumulator is composed of a rigid shell outside and a flexible storage bag inside the rigid shell is made of reinforced concrete to protect the inside flexible storage bag and endure the hydrodynamic effects of the ocean current protected by the rigid shell leakage and pollution will be avoided in case the flexible bag is damaged besides together with the foundation support it can serve as the ballast the flexible storage bag is made of high strength fabric and rubber material and is used to store the fluid energy carriers while avoiding direct contact between seawater and stored fluid the top cover unit is strategically designed to be plug and play with the help of an rov remote operated vehicle the flexible storage bag is connected with the top cover unit as a result the flexible bag can be easily removed and replaced in case it is broken seawater can flow in and out of the space between the rigid shell and flexible bag through the seawater vents at the lower position of the rigid shell the pressure of the stored fluid energy carrier is always equal to the hydrostatic pressure of the surrounding seawater thus the whole accumulator is not a pressure vessel that needs to sustain a large pressure difference to facilitate the construction deployment ballast and recycling potential the storage volume of a single accumulator is kept relatively small which may also improve the reliability of the entire underwater storage array flexible storage capacity can be achieved by means of a proper piping network that will connect multiple accumulators in series and or parallel arrangements fig 4 shows the basic working processes of this underwater accumulator during the charging process the fluid energy carrier is pumped into the flexible storage bag the shape of the flexible bag changes along with the volume of the stored fluid energy carrier the seawater in the space between the rigid shell and flexible bag is expelled from the accumulator during the constant pressure charging process the seawater flows back into the accumulator during the discharge as the stored fluid is released although the underwater accumulator is not vulnerable to rough waves it is subjected to flow induced vibration caused by the ocean current thus it is necessary to investigate the hydrostatic performance of underwater accumulators under different flow conditions in this study the hydrodynamic characteristics of an accumulator with a storage capacity of about 1000 m³ are investigated at different reynolds numbers 3 fundamentals and definitions in this section several basic physical parameters used for analyses are defined and fundamentals of les turbulence model are briefly introduced 3 1 definitions of physical parameters the reynolds number is defined by 1 r e ρ u d μ where ρ is the density of seawater u is the free stream velocity d is the characteristic length and μ is the dynamic viscosity of seawater in this study the density of seawater is set as 1 025 103 kg m3 a mean temperature of 4 c in deep water is selected and the corresponding dynamic viscosity is calculated by the following equation 2 μ μ 0 1 0 0337 t 0 000221 t 2 where μ 0 1 79 10 3 pa s is the dynamic viscosity of seawater when the temperature is 0 c thus the dynamic viscosity at 4 c is 1 572 10 3 pa s the non dimensional wall distance y is defined as 3 y u τ y ν where u τ τ w ρ is the friction velocity in which τ w and ρ are wall shear stress and density of the fluid respectively and y is the wall normal distance the lift coefficient c l and the drag coefficient c d are deduced by equation 4 and equation 5 respectively 4 c l f l 0 5 ρ u 2 s l 5 c d f d 0 5 ρ u 2 s d where f l and f d are lift force and drag force respectively s l and s d are projected area of the accumulator in the directions of lift force and drag force respectively the q criterion the second invariant of the velocity gradient is used to identify the vortex cores dubief and delcayre 2000 hunt et al 1988 it is defined by 6 q 0 5 ω 2 s 2 where ω and s represent the anti symmetric and symmetric components of the velocity gradient tensor respectively the non dimensional frequency strouhal number is calculated by 7 s t d f u where f is the frequency u is the free stream velocity and d is the characteristic diameter 3 2 turbulence model and governing equations numerical and experimental studies on flow around cylindrical bluff bodies have been widely investigated these investigations generally reveal that the les turbulence model tends to be stabler and more accurate than the rans turbulence model benhamadouche and laurence 2003 ke 2019 su et al 2013 this situation is easier to observe when the free end effect is considered palau salvador et al 2010 sumner 2013 according to authors previous numerical and experimental studies on flow over underwater energy storage accumulators at sub critical reynolds numbers vasel be hagh et al 2013 vasel be hagh et al 2015 wang 2018 wang et al 2019b wang 2020 it was concluded that the standard k ω and k ω sst turbulence models could appropriately predict the time averaged hydrodynamic characteristics but failed to capture the transient turbulence nature and the force fluctuation while the les turbulence model could potentially reveal both the time averaged results and the transient results in this study reynolds numbers are in the super critical and trans critical regimes and the free end effect is significant thus an les turbulence model is adopted for numerical simulations here the well tested smagorinsky lilly model for les is applied to the navier stokes equations of incompressible flow the filtered governing equations are written as follows 8 u i x i 0 9 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j τ i j x j where u p and ρ are velocity pressure and density respectively and τ i j is the sub grid scale stress which in the smagorinsky lilly model is determined as yagmur et al 2020 10 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 μ t s i j 11 μ t c s δ 2 s 12 s 2 s i j s i j 1 2 13 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i where μ t is the eddy viscosity δ i j is kronecker delta s i j is the filtered rate of strain tensor δ is the filter scale and c s is smagorinsky parameter and set as a constant value of 0 1 in this study 4 numerical simulations the modeling and simulation details are presented in this section the computational domain and boundary conditions are presented first then the mesh generation and independence analysis the model solving methods and solution monitoring setting are presented afterward the model verification is discussed 4 1 simplified model of accumulator to decrease computational expenses and obtain universal results the details of the accumulator are neglected and the accumulator is simplified to a cylindrical tank with a dome the dimensions of the accumulator model used in this study are as shown in fig 5 4 2 computational domain and boundary conditions fig 6 depicts the computational domain and boundary conditions used for cfd simulations in this study the diameter of the cylindrical accumulator d is used as the characteristic length to define the reynolds number and it is also used as the unit length for positioning in the coordinate system x y and z axes represent the flow direction vertical direction and cross flow direction respectively the bottom of the accumulator model is centered at 5d 0 0 uniform velocity profile is prescribed as dirichlet boundary condition at the inlet boundary outflow boundary condition with a flow rate weighting of 1 is used at the outlet of the computational domain slip wall condition is utilized on the top and side boundaries the bottom and accumulator walls are both set as no slip wall conditions in the flow direction the blockage ratio is about 4 6 and thus the effect of top and sidewalls on the flow field can be neglected as shown in table 1 four different current flow conditions are investigated in this study 4 3 mesh generation and independence fig 7 shows different views of the generated mesh due to the relatively regular shape of the accumulator model a structured mesh is employed and the computational domain is divided into 34 blocks in order to accurately capture the hydrodynamic characteristics of the accumulator model the mesh close to the no slip walls is refined and modified according to the non dimensional wall distance y ranging from 1 to 10 in the wall modeled les to ensure the accuracy of calculations and reduce the computational cost mesh independence analyses are carried out the drag coefficient in the flow direction and lift coefficient in the vertical direction are used as criteria to evaluate the mesh independence fig 8 shows the relationship between force coefficients and the number of cells when the inlet flow velocity is 1 m s the force coefficients converge to a constant value once the number of cells exceeds 2 07 million at this point the relative errors of the drag coefficient and lift coefficient are about 1 1 and 0 9 respectively thus the mesh with 2 2 million cells is used to conduct les simulations for the flow conditions u 0 5 and u 1 in this study similarly a coarse mesh independence analysis is conducted for the flow conditions u 5 and the mesh independence is obtained with 5 million cells thus for the flow conditions u 3 and u 5 the mesh with 5 million cells is used 4 4 model solving in this study the simplec algorithm is employed for the pressure velocity coupling scheme in spatial discretization to minimize numerical diffusion the gradient is set as least squares cell based and pressure is set as the second order while bounded central differencing is chosen for momentum interpolation for the transient formulation the bounded second order implicit scheme is adopted convergences at 1 10 5 for the scaled residual are set a time step of δ t 1 10 3 s is chosen for all flow conditions according to the cfl condition u δ t δ x 1 where δ x is the size of the control volume 4 5 solution monitoring for revealing the flow structures different monitoring lines and panels are set as shown in fig 9 including five lines x1 x2 x3 y1 and z1 and five panels xoy xoz yoz1 yoz2 and yoz3 turbulent velocity parameters are monitored on these lines and panels for analyzing the hydrostatic force characteristics of the accumulator model the drag force in the x axis direction and lift forces in y axis and z axis directions are monitored 4 6 model verification in order to verify the reliability of the numerical model and the accuracy of the results the mean drag coefficient and strouhal number of this study are compared with numerical and experimental results from different sources in the open literature figs 10 and 11 show the comparisons of the mean drag coefficient and strouhal number respectively overall the hydrodynamic parameters are almost constant in sub critical and trans critical regimes due to the stable boundary layer and periodic vortex shedding however the drag crisis and complex vortex shedding present in the critical and super critical regimes due to the turbulent transition of laminar boundary layer there is relatively little available data in the trans critical regime with high reynolds numbers nevertheless the results of this study are consistent with the extrapolated trends of the literature from fig 10 it is obvious that the mean drag coefficients of the underwater energy storage accumulator model are between the infinite smooth circular cylinder and the smooth sphere this is due to the in between shape of the accumulator model between a cylinder and a sphere the mean drag coefficients of this study match up well with the results of schewe 1983 while much lower than that of van hinsberg et al 2014 this can be attributed to the fact that the results were based on the rough circular cylinder and the free end effect was not considered in van hinsberg et al 2014 from fig 11 it is clear that the strouhal number of this study is very close to the experimental results of schewe 1983 and van hinsberg et al 2014 subsequently we consider our numerical model and results largely reliable 5 results and discussion in this section the flow structures and force characteristics of the accumulator at various reynolds numbers including the time averaged and transient results are presented and discussed beyond this a modal analysis is conducted to calculate the natural frequency of the designed accumulator 5 1 time averaged flow characteristics the time averaged flow characteristics at various monitoring lines and panels are presented in figs 12 18 similar flow structures are revealed under four different current flow conditions which is consistent with the results observed in previous studies at lower reynolds numbers gonçalves et al 2015 palau salvador et al 2010 rinoshika et al 2021 sumner 2013 in this study u v and w represent the velocity components along x y and z axes respectively the velocity is non dimensional to enable the comparison of the results to various flow conditions fig 12 shows profiles of non dimensional time averaged velocity component u along different monitoring lines x1 x2 and x3 at various inlet velocities u 0 5 u 1 u 3 and u 5 in the flow direction the velocity decreases to zero just ahead of the accumulator and it recovers to the steady state value in the far wake it is worth noting that the negative velocity manifests in the near wake behind the accumulator this signifies flow recirculation behind the accumulator with the increase of height from x1 to x3 the peak value of u u n increases and the length of the recirculation zone decreases this is more expected in figs 13 and 14 in the xoz panel a pair of counter rotating symmetrical vortices are observed in the xoy panel a clockwise rotating vortex becomes visible fig 15 shows profiles of non dimensional time averaged velocity component v along different monitoring lines x1 x2 and x3 at various inlet velocities u 0 5 u 1 u 3 and u 5 due to the boundary layer separation and downwash recirculation the velocity component v fluctuates in the near wake behind the accumulator the downwash recirculation in fig 14 is caused by the end effect of the top dome due to the synergy of flows around the dome and sides of the accumulator a pair of counter rotating symmetrical vortices is observed in the yoz panel as shown in fig 16 these trailing vertical structures are also observed in other studies sumner 2013 fig 17 shows profiles of non dimensional time averaged velocity component v along monitoring line y1 at various inlet velocities it is clear that velocity component v is roughly parabolic correlated to the height of the accumulator and the maximum values of v appear in the range of 0 4h 0 6h i e the middle height of the accumulator fig 18 shows the profiles of the non dimensional time averaged velocity component w along monitoring line z1 at various inlet velocities the profiles are inversely symmetrical due to the counter rotating trailing vortices 5 2 transient flow characteristics in this study the evolution of the velocity field and vortex cores are used to analyze transient flow characteristics herein the q criterion is used to identify the vortex cores fig 19 shows the q criterion iso surfaces of 1 5 around the accumulator at 1505 s when the inlet velocity is 0 5 m s the horseshoe vortex at the foot of the accumulator and complex vortex shedding behind the accumulator are clearly shown the vortices downstream of the accumulator are quite twisted and scale rich fig 20 shows the time evolution of the flow pattern downstream of the accumulator at the monitoring panel yoz1 the developments of the velocity field and vortices are very complex it is not easy to identify the prominently regular flow pattern in panel yoz1 as the turbulent flow decays the relatively regular flow patterns become more identifiable in panel yoz3 as shown in fig 21 from fig 21 the alternate shedding vortices behind both sides of the accumulator can be observed for detecting regular vortex shedding a specific flow pattern is identified as shown in fig 22 a and the appearance time interval of this pattern between 2 000 s and 3 600 s is presented in fig 22 b when the inlet velocity is 0 5 m s the average time interval is about 103 s 5 3 force characteristics fig 23 shows the time history of the drag coefficient in the flow direction and the lift coefficient in the vertical direction of the accumulator under different flow conditions it is clear that the force coefficients fluctuate around stable values due to the vortex shedding the frequency of fluctuation increases with the increasing flow velocity the mean values of force coefficients under different flow conditions are summarized in table 2 interestingly the drag and lift coefficients remain nearly stabilized at 0 45 and 0 60 respectively as flow condition varies all situations investigated in this study are in the self stimulated domain where the dimensionless drag coefficients almost do not change with increasing reynolds number fig 24 shows the time history of the lift coefficient in the cross flow direction of the accumulator under the flow condition of u 0 5 the periodic fluctuation of lift force in cross flow direction caused by the alternant vortex shedding around the sides of the accumulator is a significant potential factor that could result in viv fatigue damage the strouhal number is used to present the frequency characteristic of lift force invoking fourier transform the st amplitude diagram is obtained as shown in fig 25 the strouhal number falls between 0 1 and 0 3 some peaks are observed in this range indicating the dominant frequencies in which the vortices are shed from the accumulator this is consistent with the time interval of the identified specific flow pattern shown in fig 22 in fig 25 a dominant peak at st 0 18 can be observed which corresponds to a period of vortex shedding of 110s when the inlet flow velocity is 0 5 m s this peak represents the periodic shedding of the vortex with maximum energy similarly the peak strouhal numbers of flow conditions u 1 u 3 and u 5 are found to be 0 18 0 19 and 0 17 respectively the corresponding frequencies of four flow conditions are about 0 01 hz 0 018 hz 0 057 hz and 0 085 hz respectively thus even if the flow velocity reaches a high value of 5 m s the dominant frequency of vortex shedding remains lower than 0 1 hz the result can be used to compare with the natural frequency of accumulators for identifying the possibility of viv fatigue damage 5 4 modal analysis modal analysis is conducted using the finite element method with ansys software for calculating the natural frequency of the designed accumulator the first six order modal parameters are obtained table 3 shows the natural frequency of the first six order modes of full scale reinforced concrete accumulator model table 4 shows the material parameters of the reinforced concrete accumulator fig 26 shows the first six order vibration mode shape for a full scale accumulator it is evident that the natural frequency of the first six order modes falls in the range of 27 48 hz which is much higher than the dominant frequency of vortex shedding thus for the designed accumulator model in this study the risk of viv fatigue damage is very low 6 conclusions the energy accumulator is a critical component in underwater energy storage systems in this study the hydrodynamic characteristics of a full scale accumulator are investigated using les with smagorinsky lilly subgrid scale model numerical simulations under four different flow conditions with reynolds number range from 3 106 to 3 107 are conducted the major findings of the study are summarized as follows by analyzing the time averaged flow characteristics similar flow structures that are commonly observed in the flow around finite wall mounted and free ended cylinders are also presented in the near wake of the energy accumulator model the free end effect of the top dome results in the downwash recirculation and a pair of counter rotating symmetrical trailing vortices by comparing the non dimensional velocity components similar flow structures are revealed under four different flow conditions the existence of the recirculation zone and downwash trailing vortex may intensify the local scour around the accumulator therefore the skirted foundation support structure should be strategically designed with the local scour effect considered in the future manes and brocchini 2015 yao et al 2020 the twisted and scale rich transient vortex structures are found downstream of the accumulator periodic vortex shedding is still evident despite this the frequency of vortex shedding is consistent with the fluctuation of the lift force in the cross flow direction of the accumulator when the inlet flow velocity is 0 5 m s the period of dominant vortex shedding is about 103 s which corresponds to a strouhal number of 0 18 approximately equal strouhal numbers are also found under other flow conditions analyzing the force characteristics reveals the mean drag coefficient stabilizes at 0 45 while the frequency of fluctuating transient drag force increases with an increasing reynolds number the lift coefficients in the vertical direction and horizontal direction fluctuate around 0 60 and 0 respectively the dominating frequencies of lift force in four flow conditions are about 0 01 hz 0 018 hz 0 057 hz and 0 085 hz respectively this provides a useful reference for evaluating the hydrodynamic stability of large scale underwater energy accumulators the modal analysis shows that the first 6 natural frequency modes of the reinforced concrete accumulator are between 27 hz and 48 hz which is much lower than the dominant vortex shedding frequency presented via cfd analysis thus for the accumulator model in this study the risk of viv fatigue damage is very low nevertheless the natural frequency will change if the materials scale structure and storage rate of accumulator change thus a comprehensive modal analysis should always follow any design modifications beyond this the reliability and maintainability associated with biofouling could be a critical issue for achieving continuous maintenance free operation in the long run this study presents a fundamental investigation of the hydrodynamics of a large scale underwater energy storage accumulator it could provide an enabling reference for interested researchers and groups in the field of underwater energy storage credit authorship contribution statement zhiwen wang

20549,the purpose of the present study is to evaluate the performance of different turbulence models for predicting the interaction between breaking waves and a vertical cylinder based on the volume of fluid vof method six different models are investigated in the present study i e no turbulence model the k ω s s t turbulence model the buoyancy modified k ω s s t turbulence model the stabilized k ω s s t turbulence model the modified stabilized k ω s s t turbulence model and the realizable k ε turbulence model the vertical cylinder is installed at the edge of a 1 10 slope on the bottom of the numerical wave tank the numerical simulations are conducted by solving the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations using waves2foam a solver based on the open source computational fluid dynamic cfd software openfoam the present numerical results of the surface elevations and the breaking wave forces are compared with published experimental data the kinetic characteristics beneath the free surface including averaged velocity turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent kinematic viscosity are also investigated it is observed that the stabilized k ω s s t turbulence λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 and the buoyancy modified k ω s s t turbulence model α β s 1 176 effectively reduce the turbulent kinetic energy before wave breaking but the predicted breaking wave forces on the cylinder are smaller than that of the experimental data the k ω s s t turbulence model shows good agreement with the experimental data in terms of the free surface elevation and the breaking wave force but it over predicts the turbulent kinetic energy the realizable k ε turbulence model does not give good predictions of both the free surface elevation and the breaking wave force as compared to the published experimental data keywords breaking wave rans turbulence models vertical cylinder openfoam 1 introduction breaking wave force is considered as one of the most complex events due to its strong nonlinear characteristics it is still a challenging issue in terms of predicting breaking wave forces on marine structures circular cylinders are commonly used in the fields of coastal and offshore engineering as a basic structural component of wind turbines offshore platforms and large floating structures therefore it is important to accurately predict breaking wave forces on the cylinders for engineering design to ensure structural safety in extreme conditions experiments play an important role to investigate the physics of breaking wave forces directly sawaragi and nochino 1984 performed an experimental study of the breaking wave force on a vertical cylinder they revealed that the front shape of the breaking wave determines the rising time of the impact force and the magnitude of the force highly depends on the breaking pattern and the wave breaking point wienke et al 2001 conducted a large scale experiment to investigate the breaking wave loads acting on a vertical slender circular cylinder they found that the breaking wave force based on the morison equation is not sufficiently accurate the impact force should be included in the equation which considers the magnitude and duration of the impact irschik et al 2005 performed an experiment of breaking waves past a vertical cylinder and an inclined cylinder which direction is parallel to the wave propagation the breaking wave forces in different breaking points are studied moreover fast fourier transform fft low pass filter and empirical mode decomposition emd method were applied to divide the experimentally measured wave force into the quasi static load and the dynamic part they pointed out that the maximum wave force occurs when the wave breaks immediately in front of the cylinder in addition to the experimental investigations computational fluid dynamics cfd has become a good alternative tool cfd can not only eliminate errors from human operations and experimental facilities but also capture the details of various parameters reasonably well such as velocity acceleration and turbulent properties during the wave breaking reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are widely used for investigating the breaking wave force on the structure in engineering applications due to the good performance in terms of the balance between numerical accuracy and efficiency in recent decades a large number of numerical simulations of the interaction between breaking waves and cylinders were conducted using rans equations christensen et al 2005 simulated the breaking wave past a vertical cylinder using the volume of fluid vof method to study the wave run up and breaking wave forces they found that the peak value of the horizontal breaking wave force under a plunging breaker was much larger than that under a spilling breaker xiao and huang 2014 employed the k ε turbulence model with the vof method to investigate the breaking wave force on a vertical cylinder located at different positions along a slope in the surf zone they found that the largest wave force occurred when the cylinder was located at 3 4 r r is the maximum vertical run up height below the shoreline choi et al 2015 used the vof method to investigate breaking wave impact forces on a vertical cylinder and a inclined cylinder whose direction is parallel to the wave propagation the effects of the vibration of the cylinders in the breaking wave forces in the experiment were studied the computed breaking wave forces were in good agreement with the experimental data filtered by an fft low pass filter and emd bihs et al 2016 studied the interaction between the breaking waves and a pair of cylinders placed in tandem using the k ω turbulence model with the level set method lsm they found that the breaking wave forces acting on the cylinders were related to the location of breaking point and the distance between the cylinders kamath et al 2016 and chella et al 2017 used the k ω turbulence model with the lsm to study influences of breaking locations on the interactions of breaking waves and a vertical cylinder the largest breaking wave force was observed when the overturning wave tongue was just below the wave crest level and impacted the cylinder subsequently chow et al 2019 employed improved incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamic isph method to simulate non breaking and breaking waves past a vertical cylinder the free surface elevation and steepness of the wave across the cylinder had a significant effect on the maximum loading on the structure local pressures on the cylinder near the free surface under breaking waves were higher than those of non breaking waves liu et al 2019 employed the k ω s s t turbulence model in combination with the vof method to simulate the breaking wave past a vertical cylinder it was observed that the breaking wave force on the cylinder was in a good agreement with the experimental measurement meanwhile both slamming wave force and secondary load could generate the higher harmonic wave force in the case of breaking wave most of the above authors revealed that accurately predicting the wave breaking point is of great importance to obtain accurate breaking wave force on the cylinder lin and liu 1998 bradford 2000 and xie 2013 applied rans turbulence model k ε and k ω with vof method to study the turbulence generation and dissipation of breaking waves in the surf zone the turbulence levels in the wave crest before the wave break were significantly overestimated compared to the experimental data ting and kirby 1994 as a result it led to an underprediction of the breaking wave height mayer and madsen 2001 modified the production term of k ω model using the vorticity of the mean flow instead of the local mean velocity gradient together with vof method to simulate the spilling breaker they eliminated the excessive generation of turbulent kinetic energy tke outside the surf zone and their numerical results were in good agreement with experimental measurements in term of elevation statistics brown et al 2016 evaluated different rans turbulence models with vof method for predicting of spilling and plunging breakers in the surf zone the realizable k ε model gave reasonable predictions of the surface elevation time averaged velocity and mean tke profiles in terms of accuracy and numerical efficiency while the k ω s s t turbulence model performed best for the wave elevation predictions devolder et al 2018 proposed a buoyancy modified k ω turbulence model for breaking wave simulating a buoyancy term is added in the turbulent kinetic energy equation and is active before wave breaking to suppress the turbulence around the free surface the density was explicitly included in the turbulence transport equations it was pointed out that the buoyancy modified turbulence models significantly reduced the common over estimation of tke around the free surface larsen and fuhrman 2018 proposed a stabilized formulation for two equation turbulence models using the addition of stress limiting modification the new model can avoid non physical exponential growth of the turbulent kinetic energy and eddy viscosity in the nearly potential flow region the numerical results of surface elevations can be predicted accurately meanwhile reasonable turbulent kinetic energy and undertow velocity profiles were obtained liu et al 2020 evaluated the performance of two free surface modelling approaches continuous free surface conditions and free surface jump conditions and three different k ω s s t turbulence models k ω s s t buoyancy modified k ω s s t and free surface k ω s s t for simulating spilling and plunging breakers respectively it was demonstrated that the free surface jump conditions eliminated spurious air velocity which can occur in the continuous free surface conditions due to imbalance between dynamic pressure gradient and density gradient all the aforementioned research simulated wave breaking in the surf zone without considering the presence of structures when the breaking wave impacts structures the velocity of the wave crest front hitting the cylinder reduces to zero a large wave impact force occurs on the cylinder meanwhile the structure will also change the wave breaking point as compared to the case without structure therefore it is necessary to evaluate the performance of different turbulence models on the interaction between breaking waves and structures the main objective of the present study is to evaluate the performance of different rans turbulence models together with the vof method in simulating breaking waves past a vertical cylinder the paper is organized as follows first the governing equations for the numerical model are presented followed by the grid and time step refinement studies then six simulations cases with different turbulence models are performed to predict the surface elevations and breaking wave forces on the vertical cylinder the present numerical results are compared with the published experimental data from irschik et al 2005 which was presented by choi et al 2015 subsequently time averaged velocity profiles and turbulent behavior are discussed in details finally conclusions are drawn based on the present numerical results 2 numerical method the numerical

regarding their performance for predicting the interaction between the breaking wave and the vertical cylinder 2 2 1 the k ω s s t model the k ω s s t turbulence model was proposed by menter et al 2003 to effectively blend the k ε turbulence model in the far field and k ω turbulence model in the near wall region it avoids the problem that the k ω turbulence model is very sensitive to the inlet free stream turbulence properties besides the k ω s s t turbulence model shows good behavior in predicting adverse pressure gradient and separation flow two advection diﬀusion equations for turbulent

devolder et al 2018 proposed a buoyancy modified k ω s s t turbulence model the buoyancy term g b is added to the tke equation to avoid the large production of turbulent kinetic energy due to the unbalanced pressure gradient and density gradient between water and air at the free surface the two equations for k and ω are expressed as 12 ρ k t ρ u i k x i x i μ σ k μ t k x i p k g b β ρ ω k 13 ρ

and the default value is 1 176 2 2 3 the stabilized k ω s s t model larsen and fuhrman 2018 proposed a stabilized k ω s s t closure model by adding buoyancy production term g b and stress limiting modifications to the k ω s s t menter et al 2003 model this turbulence model aims to avoid non physical exponential growth of the turbulent kinetic energy and eddy viscosity in the nearly potential

u i x j u j x i note that the new addition to the limiter in equation 15 will become active only in a region of nearly potential flow where p 0 p ω the other details of model parameters definitions and coefficients are the same as the k ω s s t turbulence model menter et al 2003 2 2 4 the realizable k ε model the realizable k ε model developed by shih et al 1995 differs from the standard k ε model in two ways first the realizable k ε model contains a new formulation for the turbulent viscosity c μ is a variable instead of constant the second difference is that a new transport equation for the dissipation rate ε is applied which is derived from an exact equation for the transport of the mean square vorticity fluctuation the realizable k ε model exhibits superior performance for spreading rate of jets boundary layers under strong adverse pressure gradients and involving rotation two equations of k and ε in the realizable k ε model are defined as 16 ρ k t ρ k u j x j x j μ μ t

method is based on a volume fraction coefficient α which is 0 for air and 1 for water the volume fraction is solved by following the advection equation 20 α t α u i x i α 1 α u i r x i 0 where u i r is the relative velocity between the water phase and the air phase the density and kinematic viscosity at the interface are obtained by a weighted value based on the volume fraction coefficient α 21 ρ α ρ w 1 α ρ a ν α ν w 1 α ν a where ρ w and ρ a denote the densities of water and air ν w and ν a are the kinematic viscosity coefficients of water and air 2 4 relaxation method the wave relaxation algorithm presented by jacobsen et al 2012 is applied to generate and absorb waves in the numerical wave tank nwt the velocity and the wave surface elevation ramp up to the target values according to the wave theory the relaxation function is expressed by 22 φ γ r φ c o m p u t e d 1 γ r φ t a r g e t where φ is either velocity u i or volume fraction α and the weighting factor γ r is defined as 23 γ r 1 exp χ r 3 5 1 exp 1 1 χ r 0 1 2 5 numerical scheme the finite volume method fvm is used to solve the navier stokes equations the piso simple pimple algorithm is used to deal with the pressure and velocity coupling the second order implicit crank nicolson scheme is applied for the discretization of the time domain the second order gauss integration with linear interpolation combining limitedlinear 1 limiter function is used for the convective terms the second order gauss integration with linear interpolation is employed for the diffusive terms the pressure is solved by the generalised geometric algebraic multi grid gamg numerical method with diagonal based incomplete cholesky dic preconditioner 3 numerical implementation 3 1 computational domain the setup of the computational domain is done according to the experimental tests conducted by irschik et al 2005 the dimensions of the numerical wave tank nwt are 120 0 m long 5 m wide and 8 m height as shown in fig 1 a cylinder with the diameter of d 0 7 m is installed with its central axis at the edge of the slope 1 10 the water depth of nwt is 3 8 m a wave gauge wg is used to measure the free surface elevation near the sidewall along the frontline of the cylinder both the wave generation zone and the absorption zone are one wavelength long the wave height of h 1 3 m and the wave period of t 4 0 s is generated in the nwt for all the simulation cases 3 2 boundary conditions the no slip condition for velocity and zero gradient condition for pressure are employed in the front back bottom and cylinder s surface boundaries the wall functions are employed to simulate characteristics of the boundary layer the dimensionless wall distance y y d n u t ν where d n is the normal distance to the wall u t is the friction velocity and ν is the kinematic viscosity is in the range of 40 200 for the present simulation the water velocity is obtained from the wave theory and the air velocity is zero at the inlet boundary at the outlet boundary both the water and air velocities are set to zero the pressures are specified as zero gradient condition at the inlet and outlet boundaries on the top domain the pressureinletoutletvelocity is applied to the velocity which means that the velocity for the inflow is calculated from the ﬂux in the patch normal direction and the velocity for the outflow is set as the zero normal gradient boundary condition the totalpressure is used to calculated pressure on the top boundary which is obtained by subtracting the dynamic pressure from the total pressure expressed as follows 24 p p p 0 0 5 u 2 where p 0 is total pressure and u is the mean velocity vector 3 3 convergence studies the grid and time step refinement studies are carried out in terms of the horizontal breaking wave forces on the cylinder and the free surface elevations at wg location with the k ω s s t turbulence model two strategies are employed to optimize the computational cost firstly the non uniform grid which is refined in the vicinity of the cylinder and the free surface is used secondly the adaptive time step approach based on maximum courant number comax is employed different meshes and courant number are shown in table 1 moreover the side view and top view of the medium mesh around the vertical cylinder are also shown in fig 2 figs 3 and 4 show the total horizontal breaking wave forces f on the vertical cylinder and the free surface elevations η at wg location with three sets of meshes over one wave period respectively the relative variation in peak values of f between the fine mesh and the medium mesh is 2 2 the difference in the free surface elevation between the fine mesh and the medium mesh is 3 0 the grid resolution of the medium mesh is considered sufficiently accurate for the present simulations moreover the refinement study on time step is also carried out by changing comax it can be seen from figs 5 and 6 that there is no significant change for the peaks of f and η when comax decreases from 0 5 to 0 3 therefore the medium mesh with comax 0 5 is considered to give satisfactory numerical accuracy and will be used in subsequent simulations 4 results and discussion in this study six simulation cases are conducted as listed in table 2 for case 4 the modified stabilized k ω s s t turbulence model λ 2 0 05 α β s 0 is employed to investigate the effects of buoyancy modification coefficient and the stress limiter coefficient on the numerical results by comparing with case 2 and case 5 the numerical results of free surface elevations and horizontal wave forces on the cylinder are compared with experimental data from irschik et al 2005 presented by choi et al 2015 to evaluate the performance of different turbulence models moreover the time averaged velocity breaker locations and the turbulent behavior are discussed all the present simulations are performed for a minimum duration of 40 wave periods and the last ten wave periods are averaged and used as the present results 4 1 free surface elevations and breaking wave forces fig 7 shows the comparison of surface elevations η at location wg see fig 1 between the numerical results predicted by different numerical models and the experimental data over one wave period all the models generally show a good agreement in the surface elevations with the experimental data the modified stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 0 and the k ω s s t turbulence models agree best with the experimental data except for the slight discrepancy at t t 1 05 in the experiment the wave gauges were installed near the wave tank sidewall to avoid the influence of the measurement equipment on the waves the interactions between the wave tank sidewall and the wave gauges as well as the interactions between different wave gauges can affect the nearby free surface in fig 7 a and b it can be observed that the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 turbulence model gives similar results to the no turbulence model and the peak of surface elevations are predicted accurately however the corresponding numerical values are lower than the experimental data at t t 0 3 and t t 0 9 this is due to that the wave breaks prematurely before it arrives at the vertical cylinder in addition the predicted peaks of the surface elevations using turbulence models the k ω s s t turbulence model the buoyancy modified k ω s s t turbulence model the stabilized k ω s s t turbulence model the modified stabilized k ω s s t turbulence model and the realizable k ε turbulence model are slightly lower than that without turbulence model according to the law of conservation of energy the kinetic energy and potential energy transform to each other during the wave propagation process when the turbulence model is applied the turbulent kinetic energy is generated by extracting energy from the total kinetic energy and will dissipate due to the viscous force and disappear eventually therefore the application of turbulence models reduces the total kinetic energy as a result the slightly smaller peaks of surface elevations are observed in the numerical results with the turbulence models fig 8 presents the comparison of the numerical horizontal breaking wave forces f t on the cylinder and the corresponding experimental data over one wave period fig 9 shows the snapshots of the waves crest front touching the cylinder with the horizontal velocity contours using different turbulence models the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 turbulence model the modified stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 0 turbulence model the buoyancy modified k ω s s t turbulence model α β s 1 176 and the no turbulence model give a similar prediction for the breaking wave forces the peaks of wave forces are lower and appear earlier than the experimental measurement the reason is that the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 turbulence model and the buoyancy modified k ω s s t turbulence model α β s 1 176 produce a very low value of tke see fig 11 therefore the turbulence effect is very limited showing similar behavior with the no turbulence model the waves breaking prematurely cause an overturn wave tongue hitting the cylinder as shown in fig 9 a and b in fig 8 e the k ω s s t turbulence model predicts the breaking wave force reasonably well as compared with the experimental data both the first peak and the second peak of the breaking wave force are predicted accurately the wave front is almost vertical when it impacts on the cylinder as shown in fig 9 e additionally the wave force computed by the realizable k ε turbulence model is underestimated as compared with the experimental data this could imply that the wave does not break before hitting the cylinder the wave front is inclined when it reaches the cylinder see fig 9 f which cause the small wave force fig 8 shows that the computed rise time of the wave force is ahead of the experimental rise time around t t 0 4 this can be explained as the assumptions of incompressible flow and rigidly fixed cylinders applied in the present numerical simulations however in the experiment cylinder vibration the compressibility of the flow and water droplets on the surface of the cylinder can influence the rise time similar phenomena can also be found in the validation studies done by liu et al 2019 kamath et al 2016 and bihs et al 2016 overall the breaking wave force on the cylinder depends not only on the wave elevation but also on the wave front shape when it hits the cylinder a slight change in the predicted wave breaking point may have a significant effect on the value of the wave force the k ω s s t turbulence model with the vof method shows reasonably good performance in predicting both surface elevations and wave forces on the vertical cylinder 4 2 averaged velocity profiles fig 10 shows the comparison of time averaged horizontal velocities with different turbulence models at location v see fig 1 the position of v is located in the flat bottom section of the nwt at x 25 m the vertical axis denotes the vertical coordinates in the nwt the horizontal axis represents the values of averaged horizontal velocities at location v all the numerical models can capture the basic variation of the averaged horizontal velocity it is negative throughout the majority of the water column and becomes positive near the free water surface the mean velocities are small near the bottom of the water column and increase gradually when the position approaches the free surface meanwhile negative velocity gradients are observed as the water depth increases when using the no turbulence model stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 turbulence model and modified stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 0 turbulence model while velocity gradients are positive for the k ω s s t turbulence model and the realizable k ε turbulence model at the same location as aforementioned the function of the buoyancy term is to avoid the large production of turbulent kinetic energy due to the unbalanced pressure gradient and density gradient between the water and air phases at the free surface it means that the buoyancy term mainly affects the flow characteristics near the free surface therefore the time averaged horizontal velocity profiles calculated by turbulence models with buoyancy term stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 and the buoyancy modified k ω s s t α β s 1 176 show similar trend near the free surface see the free surface region in fig 10 while the stress limiter coefficient can affect the entire flow field this can be verified by comparing the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 and the modified stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 0 which shows the similar time averaged horizontal velocity profiles under the free surface see the region of z 1 5 m in fig 10 eventually when the buoyancy modification coefficient and the stress limiter coefficient are employed simultaneously in the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 the time averaged horizontal velocity profile is almost same with that in the case of no turbulence model in the vicinity and underneath the free surface 4 3 turbulent behavior in order to identify the turbulent behaviour of the different turbulence models contours of the turbulent kinetic energy k around the breaking point are depicted in fig 11 the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 turbulence model and the buoyancy modified k ω s s t α β s 1 176 turbulence model show very small values of tke in the entire fluid domain before the wave breaking see fig 11 a and b this is attributed to the function of the limiter inside the buoyancy term of tke equation the positions of wave breaking points predicted by the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 turbulence model and the buoyancy modified k ω s s t α β s 1 176 turbulence model are ahead of the other turbulence models the tke predicted by the modified stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 0 turbulence model presents a high value on the wave crest of the breaking point fig 11 c however the largest tke is obtained from the k ω s s t turbulence model near the free surface which can be seen in fig 11 d it causes that the total kinetic energy is diffused and dissipated during the wave propagation finally the breaking point predicted by the k ω s s t turbulence model is beyond the breaking points predicted by the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 turbulence model the buoyancy modified k ω s s t α β s 1 176 turbulence model and the modified stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 0 turbulence model fig 11 d shows that the position of wave breaking point predicted by the k ω s s t model is at the front surface of the vertical cylinder which is consistent with the predictions by bihs et al 2016 kamath et al 2016 and choi et al 2015 as well as the experimental data by irschik et al 2005 in the realizable k ε turbulence model the more kinetic energy is converted into tke in the entire fluid domain see fig 11 e the total kinetic energy loss makes the wave to reach the cylinder without breaking this is consistent with the aforementioned discussion that the surface elevation and the breaking wave force predicted by the realizable k ε turbulence model are underestimated as compared to the experimental data furthermore contours of the turbulent kinematic viscosity ν t using different turbulence models are depicted in fig 12 in the cases of the turbulence models with buoyancy modified term see fig 12 a and b ν t around the free surface goes to zero when the stress limiter coefficient λ 2 is also employed see fig 12 a ν t is zero not only on the free surface but also inside the fluid before the breaking point this means that there is no obvious turbulent effect in the flow field before the breaking point the performance of the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 and the no turbulence model are almost identical in terms of the surface elevations at location wg the wave forces on the cylinder and the locations of breaking points the comparison between fig 12 c and d shows that the stress limiter coefficient λ 2 significantly reduces ν t in the entire flow field the buoyancy modification coefficient α β s mainly affects the ν t on the free surface based on the comparison of fig 12 b and d the realizable k ε turbulence model predicts relatively large ν t in the active flow field leading to the non breaking wave before reaching the cylinder in summary both the stress limiter coefficient λ 2 and the buoyancy modification coefficient α β s have an important influence on predictions of free surface elevation breaking wave force tke and ν t the turbulence models with the buoyancy modified term give more physical tke i e no turbulence before wave breaking and relatively large turbulence intensity in the post breaking zone behind the cylinder however the predicted breaking wave forces are smaller than that of the experimental data this may be due to the properties of the vof method the vof method usually results in a large air velocity at the free surface due to the continuity condition at the interface of water and air phases liu et al 2020 this problem can be potentially improved by the large turbulence intensity produced by the k ω s s t turbulence model therefore the k ω s s t turbulence model performs well on the surface elevation and the breaking wave force despite overestimating levels of tke the realizable k ε turbulence model over predicts the tke and under estimates the breaking wave force 5 conclusions and discussion in this paper different rans turbulence models with the vof method have been evaluated for investigating the interaction between the breaking waves and the vertical cylinder the main conclusions in the present study can be drawn as follows 1 the position of the breaking point has a significant effect on the breaking wave force on the cylinder the slight change in the wave front shape may lead to a large difference in the wave forces on the cylinder 2 the stabilized k ω s s t turbulence model λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 performs almost the same as no turbulence model for predicting breaking wave forces the wave breaks before hitting the vertical cylinder and the predicted breaking wave forces are smaller than the corresponding experimental data the realizable k ε turbulence model under predicts the surface elevation and the breaking wave force on the cylinder 3 the turbulence models with the buoyancy modified term the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 and the buoyancy modified k ω s s t α β s 1 176 significantly reduce the turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent kinematic viscosity in the flow field showing more physical turbulence behavior before the wave breaking 4 the k ω s s t turbulence model accurately predicts the free surface elevations and the breaking wave forces as compared to the published experimental data however the level of the turbulent kinetic energy is overestimated especially at the wave crest 5 the buoyancy modification coefficient mainly affects the flow characteristics at the free surface while the stress limiter coefficient can affect the flow characteristics in the entire flow field it appears that none of the aforementioned turbulence models perform perfectly for predicting breaking waves past a vertical cylinder the stabilized and buoyancy modified k ω s s t models are more capable of turbulence intensity prediction the combination of the vof method and the k ω s s t turbulence model seems to give a reasonable prediction on the breaking point which eventually predicts the wave forces well even though the turbulent kinetic energy is overestimated at the wave crest credit authorship contribution

20549,the purpose of the present study is to evaluate the performance of different turbulence models for predicting the interaction between breaking waves and a vertical cylinder based on the volume of fluid vof method six different models are investigated in the present study i e no turbulence model the k ω s s t turbulence model the buoyancy modified k ω s s t turbulence model the stabilized k ω s s t turbulence model the modified stabilized k ω s s t turbulence model and the realizable k ε turbulence model the vertical cylinder is installed at the edge of a 1 10 slope on the bottom of the numerical wave tank the numerical simulations are conducted by solving the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations using waves2foam a solver based on the open source computational fluid dynamic cfd software openfoam the present numerical results of the surface elevations and the breaking wave forces are compared with published experimental data the kinetic characteristics beneath the free surface including averaged velocity turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent kinematic viscosity are also investigated it is observed that the stabilized k ω s s t turbulence λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 and the buoyancy modified k ω s s t turbulence model α β s 1 176 effectively reduce the turbulent kinetic energy before wave breaking but the predicted breaking wave forces on the cylinder are smaller than that of the experimental data the k ω s s t turbulence model shows good agreement with the experimental data in terms of the free surface elevation and the breaking wave force but it over predicts the turbulent kinetic energy the realizable k ε turbulence model does not give good predictions of both the free surface elevation and the breaking wave force as compared to the published experimental data keywords breaking wave rans turbulence models vertical cylinder openfoam 1 introduction breaking wave force is considered as one of the most complex events due to its strong nonlinear characteristics it is still a challenging issue in terms of predicting breaking wave forces on marine structures circular cylinders are commonly used in the fields of coastal and offshore engineering as a basic structural component of wind turbines offshore platforms and large floating structures therefore it is important to accurately predict breaking wave forces on the cylinders for engineering design to ensure structural safety in extreme conditions experiments play an important role to investigate the physics of breaking wave forces directly sawaragi and nochino 1984 performed an experimental study of the breaking wave force on a vertical cylinder they revealed that the front shape of the breaking wave determines the rising time of the impact force and the magnitude of the force highly depends on the breaking pattern and the wave breaking point wienke et al 2001 conducted a large scale experiment to investigate the breaking wave loads acting on a vertical slender circular cylinder they found that the breaking wave force based on the morison equation is not sufficiently accurate the impact force should be included in the equation which considers the magnitude and duration of the impact irschik et al 2005 performed an experiment of breaking waves past a vertical cylinder and an inclined cylinder which direction is parallel to the wave propagation the breaking wave forces in different breaking points are studied moreover fast fourier transform fft low pass filter and empirical mode decomposition emd method were applied to divide the experimentally measured wave force into the quasi static load and the dynamic part they pointed out that the maximum wave force occurs when the wave breaks immediately in front of the cylinder in addition to the experimental investigations computational fluid dynamics cfd has become a good alternative tool cfd can not only eliminate errors from human operations and experimental facilities but also capture the details of various parameters reasonably well such as velocity acceleration and turbulent properties during the wave breaking reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are widely used for investigating the breaking wave force on the structure in engineering applications due to the good performance in terms of the balance between numerical accuracy and efficiency in recent decades a large number of numerical simulations of the interaction between breaking waves and cylinders were conducted using rans equations christensen et al 2005 simulated the breaking wave past a vertical cylinder using the volume of fluid vof method to study the wave run up and breaking wave forces they found that the peak value of the horizontal breaking wave force under a plunging breaker was much larger than that under a spilling breaker xiao and huang 2014 employed the k ε turbulence model with the vof method to investigate the breaking wave force on a vertical cylinder located at different positions along a slope in the surf zone they found that the largest wave force occurred when the cylinder was located at 3 4 r r is the maximum vertical run up height below the shoreline choi et al 2015 used the vof method to investigate breaking wave impact forces on a vertical cylinder and a inclined cylinder whose direction is parallel to the wave propagation the effects of the vibration of the cylinders in the breaking wave forces in the experiment were studied the computed breaking wave forces were in good agreement with the experimental data filtered by an fft low pass filter and emd bihs et al 2016 studied the interaction between the breaking waves and a pair of cylinders placed in tandem using the k ω turbulence model with the level set method lsm they found that the breaking wave forces acting on the cylinders were related to the location of breaking point and the distance between the cylinders kamath et al 2016 and chella et al 2017 used the k ω turbulence model with the lsm to study influences of breaking locations on the interactions of breaking waves and a vertical cylinder the largest breaking wave force was observed when the overturning wave tongue was just below the wave crest level and impacted the cylinder subsequently chow et al 2019 employed improved incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamic isph method to simulate non breaking and breaking waves past a vertical cylinder the free surface elevation and steepness of the wave across the cylinder had a significant effect on the maximum loading on the structure local pressures on the cylinder near the free surface under breaking waves were higher than those of non breaking waves liu et al 2019 employed the k ω s s t turbulence model in combination with the vof method to simulate the breaking wave past a vertical cylinder it was observed that the breaking wave force on the cylinder was in a good agreement with the experimental measurement meanwhile both slamming wave force and secondary load could generate the higher harmonic wave force in the case of breaking wave most of the above authors revealed that accurately predicting the wave breaking point is of great importance to obtain accurate breaking wave force on the cylinder lin and liu 1998 bradford 2000 and xie 2013 applied rans turbulence model k ε and k ω with vof method to study the turbulence generation and dissipation of breaking waves in the surf zone the turbulence levels in the wave crest before the wave break were significantly overestimated compared to the experimental data ting and kirby 1994 as a result it led to an underprediction of the breaking wave height mayer and madsen 2001 modified the production term of k ω model using the vorticity of the mean flow instead of the local mean velocity gradient together with vof method to simulate the spilling breaker they eliminated the excessive generation of turbulent kinetic energy tke outside the surf zone and their numerical results were in good agreement with experimental measurements in term of elevation statistics brown et al 2016 evaluated different rans turbulence models with vof method for predicting of spilling and plunging breakers in the surf zone the realizable k ε model gave reasonable predictions of the surface elevation time averaged velocity and mean tke profiles in terms of accuracy and numerical efficiency while the k ω s s t turbulence model performed best for the wave elevation predictions devolder et al 2018 proposed a buoyancy modified k ω turbulence model for breaking wave simulating a buoyancy term is added in the turbulent kinetic energy equation and is active before wave breaking to suppress the turbulence around the free surface the density was explicitly included in the turbulence transport equations it was pointed out that the buoyancy modified turbulence models significantly reduced the common over estimation of tke around the free surface larsen and fuhrman 2018 proposed a stabilized formulation for two equation turbulence models using the addition of stress limiting modification the new model can avoid non physical exponential growth of the turbulent kinetic energy and eddy viscosity in the nearly potential flow region the numerical results of surface elevations can be predicted accurately meanwhile reasonable turbulent kinetic energy and undertow velocity profiles were obtained liu et al 2020 evaluated the performance of two free surface modelling approaches continuous free surface conditions and free surface jump conditions and three different k ω s s t turbulence models k ω s s t buoyancy modified k ω s s t and free surface k ω s s t for simulating spilling and plunging breakers respectively it was demonstrated that the free surface jump conditions eliminated spurious air velocity which can occur in the continuous free surface conditions due to imbalance between dynamic pressure gradient and density gradient all the aforementioned research simulated wave breaking in the surf zone without considering the presence of structures when the breaking wave impacts structures the velocity of the wave crest front hitting the cylinder reduces to zero a large wave impact force occurs on the cylinder meanwhile the structure will also change the wave breaking point as compared to the case without structure therefore it is necessary to evaluate the performance of different turbulence models on the interaction between breaking waves and structures the main objective of the present study is to evaluate the performance of different rans turbulence models together with the vof method in simulating breaking waves past a vertical cylinder the paper is organized as follows first the governing equations for the numerical model are presented followed by the grid and time step refinement studies then six simulations cases with different turbulence models are performed to predict the surface elevations and breaking wave forces on the vertical cylinder the present numerical results are compared with the published experimental data from irschik et al 2005 which was presented by choi et al 2015 subsequently time averaged velocity profiles and turbulent behavior are discussed in details finally conclusions are drawn based on the present numerical results 2 numerical method the numerical

regarding their performance for predicting the interaction between the breaking wave and the vertical cylinder 2 2 1 the k ω s s t model the k ω s s t turbulence model was proposed by menter et al 2003 to effectively blend the k ε turbulence model in the far field and k ω turbulence model in the near wall region it avoids the problem that the k ω turbulence model is very sensitive to the inlet

devolder et al 2018 proposed a buoyancy modified k ω s s t turbulence model the buoyancy term g b is added to the tke equation to avoid the large production of turbulent kinetic energy due to the unbalanced pressure gradient and density gradient between water and air at the free surface the two equations for k and ω are expressed as 12 ρ k t ρ u i k x i x i μ σ k μ t k x i p k g b β ρ ω k 13 ρ

model in two ways first the realizable k ε model contains a new formulation for the turbulent viscosity c μ is a variable instead of constant the second difference is that a new transport equation for the dissipation rate ε is applied which is derived from an exact equation for the transport of the mean square vorticity fluctuation the realizable k ε model exhibits superior performance for spreading rate of jets boundary layers under strong adverse pressure gradients and involving rotation two equations of k and ε in the realizable k ε model are defined as 16 ρ k t ρ k u j x j x j μ μ t σ k k x j p k p b ρ ε y m s k 17 ρ ε t ρ ε u j x j x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j ρ c 1 s ε ρ c 2 ε 2 k ν ε c 1 ε ε k c 3 ε p b s ε where c 1 max 0 43 η 5 η η s k ε p k and p b represents the generation of turbulence kinetic energy due to the mean velocity gradients and the buoyancy respectively the turbulent viscosity is computed using 18 μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε and c μ is given by 19 c μ 1 a 0 a s u k ε the constants of this model are c 1 ε 1 44 c 2 1 9 σ k 1 0 σ ε 1 2 a 0 4 0 2 3 free surface capture the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 is used to capture the interface between the air and the water the method is based on a volume fraction coefficient α which is 0 for air and 1 for water the volume fraction is solved by following the advection equation 20 α t α u i x i α 1 α u i r x i 0 where u i r is the relative velocity between the water phase and the air phase the density and kinematic viscosity at the interface are obtained by a weighted value based on the volume fraction coefficient α 21 ρ α ρ w 1 α ρ a ν α ν w 1 α ν a where ρ w and ρ a denote the densities of water and air ν w and ν a are the kinematic viscosity coefficients of water and air 2 4 relaxation method the wave relaxation algorithm presented by jacobsen et al 2012 is applied to generate and absorb waves in the numerical wave tank nwt the velocity and the wave surface elevation ramp up to the target values according to the wave theory the relaxation function is expressed by 22 φ γ r φ c o m p u t e d 1 γ r φ t a r g e t where φ is either velocity u i or volume fraction α and the weighting factor γ r is defined as 23 γ r 1 exp χ r 3 5 1 exp 1 1 χ r 0 1 2 5 numerical scheme the finite volume method fvm is used to solve the navier stokes equations the piso simple pimple algorithm is used to deal with the pressure and velocity coupling the second order implicit crank nicolson scheme is applied for the discretization of the time domain the second order gauss integration with linear interpolation combining limitedlinear 1 limiter function is used for the convective terms the second order gauss integration with linear interpolation is employed for the diffusive terms the pressure is solved by the generalised geometric algebraic multi grid gamg numerical method with diagonal based incomplete cholesky dic preconditioner 3 numerical implementation 3 1 computational domain the setup of the computational domain is done according to the experimental tests conducted by irschik et al 2005 the dimensions of the numerical wave tank nwt are 120 0 m long 5 m wide and 8 m height as shown in fig 1 a cylinder with the diameter of d 0 7 m is installed with its central axis at the edge of the slope 1 10 the water depth of nwt is 3 8 m a wave gauge wg is used to measure the free surface elevation near the sidewall along the frontline of the cylinder both the wave generation zone and the absorption zone are one wavelength long the wave height of h 1 3 m and the wave period of t 4 0 s is generated in the nwt for all the simulation cases 3 2 boundary conditions the no slip condition for velocity and zero gradient condition for pressure are employed in the front back bottom and cylinder s surface boundaries the wall functions are employed to simulate characteristics of the boundary layer the dimensionless wall distance y y d n u t ν where d n is the normal distance to the wall u t is the friction velocity and ν is the kinematic viscosity is in the range of 40 200 for the present simulation the water velocity is obtained from the wave theory and the air velocity is zero at the inlet boundary at the outlet boundary both the water and air velocities are set to zero the pressures are specified as zero gradient condition at the inlet and outlet boundaries on the top domain the pressureinletoutletvelocity is applied to the velocity which means that the velocity for the inflow is calculated from the ﬂux in the patch normal direction and the velocity for the outflow is set as the zero normal gradient boundary condition the totalpressure is used to calculated pressure on the top boundary which is obtained by subtracting the dynamic pressure from the total pressure expressed as follows 24 p p p 0 0 5 u 2 where p 0 is total pressure and u is the mean velocity vector 3 3 convergence studies the grid and time step refinement studies are carried out in terms of the horizontal breaking wave forces on the cylinder and the free surface elevations at wg location with the k ω s s t turbulence model two strategies are employed to optimize the computational cost firstly the non uniform grid which is refined in the vicinity of the cylinder and the free surface is used secondly the adaptive time step approach based on maximum courant number comax is employed different meshes and courant number are shown in table 1 moreover the side view and top view of the medium mesh around the vertical cylinder are also shown in fig 2 figs 3 and 4 show the total horizontal breaking wave forces f on the vertical cylinder and the free surface elevations η at wg location with three sets of meshes over one wave period respectively the relative variation in peak values of f between the fine mesh and the medium mesh is 2 2 the difference in the free surface elevation between the fine mesh and the medium mesh is 3 0 the grid resolution of the medium mesh is considered sufficiently accurate for the present simulations moreover the refinement study on time step is also carried out by changing comax it can be seen from figs 5 and 6 that there is no significant change for the peaks of f and η when comax decreases from 0 5 to 0 3 therefore the medium mesh with comax 0 5 is considered to give satisfactory numerical accuracy and will be used in subsequent simulations 4 results and discussion in this study six simulation cases are conducted as listed in table 2 for case 4 the modified stabilized k ω s s t turbulence model λ 2 0 05 α β s 0 is employed to investigate the effects of buoyancy modification coefficient and the stress limiter coefficient on the numerical results by comparing with case 2 and case 5 the numerical results of free surface elevations and horizontal wave forces on the cylinder are compared with experimental data from irschik et al 2005 presented by choi et al 2015 to evaluate the performance of different turbulence models moreover the time averaged velocity breaker locations and the turbulent behavior are discussed all the present simulations are performed for a minimum duration of 40 wave periods and the last ten wave periods are averaged and used as the present results 4 1 free surface elevations and breaking wave forces fig 7 shows the comparison of surface elevations η at location wg see fig 1 between the numerical results predicted by different numerical models and the experimental data over one wave period all the models generally show a good agreement in the surface elevations with the experimental data the modified stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 0 and the k ω s s t turbulence models agree best with the experimental data except for the slight discrepancy at t t 1 05 in the experiment the wave gauges were installed near the wave tank sidewall to avoid the influence of the measurement equipment on the waves the interactions between the wave tank sidewall and the wave gauges as well as the interactions between different wave gauges can affect the nearby free surface in fig 7 a and b it can be observed that the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 turbulence model gives similar results to the no turbulence model and the peak of surface elevations are predicted accurately however the corresponding numerical values are lower than the experimental data at t t 0 3 and t t 0 9 this is due to that the wave breaks prematurely before it arrives at the vertical cylinder in addition the predicted peaks of the surface elevations using turbulence models the k ω s s t turbulence model the buoyancy modified k ω s s t turbulence model the stabilized k ω s s t turbulence model the modified stabilized k ω s s t turbulence model and the realizable k ε turbulence model are slightly lower than that without turbulence model according to the law of conservation of energy the kinetic energy and potential energy transform to each other during the wave propagation process when the turbulence model is applied the turbulent kinetic energy is generated by extracting energy from the total kinetic energy and will dissipate due to the viscous force and disappear eventually therefore the application of turbulence models reduces the total kinetic energy as a result the slightly smaller peaks of surface elevations are observed in the numerical results with the turbulence models fig 8 presents the comparison of the numerical horizontal breaking wave forces f t on the cylinder and the corresponding experimental data over one wave period fig 9 shows the snapshots of the waves crest front touching the cylinder with the horizontal velocity contours using different turbulence models the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 turbulence model the modified stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 0 turbulence model the buoyancy modified k ω s s t turbulence model α β s 1 176 and the no turbulence model give a similar prediction for the breaking wave forces the peaks of wave forces are lower and appear earlier than the experimental measurement the reason is that the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 turbulence model and the buoyancy modified k ω s s t turbulence model α β s 1 176 produce a very low value of tke see fig 11 therefore the turbulence effect is very limited showing similar behavior with the no turbulence model the waves breaking prematurely cause an overturn wave tongue hitting the cylinder as shown in fig 9 a and b in fig 8 e the k ω s s t turbulence model predicts the breaking wave force reasonably well as compared with the experimental data both the first peak and the second peak of the breaking wave force are predicted accurately the wave front is almost vertical when it impacts on the cylinder as shown in fig 9 e additionally the wave force computed by the realizable k ε turbulence model is underestimated as compared with the experimental data this could imply that the wave does not break before hitting the cylinder the wave front is inclined when it reaches the cylinder see fig 9 f which cause the small wave force fig 8 shows that the computed rise time of the wave force is ahead of the experimental rise time around t t 0 4 this can be explained as the assumptions of incompressible flow and rigidly fixed cylinders applied in the present numerical simulations however in the experiment cylinder vibration the compressibility of the flow and water droplets on the surface of the cylinder can influence the rise time similar phenomena can also be found in the validation studies done by liu et al 2019 kamath et al 2016 and bihs et al 2016 overall the breaking wave force on the cylinder depends not only on the wave elevation but also on the wave front shape when it hits the cylinder a slight change in the predicted wave breaking point may have a significant effect on the value of the wave force the k ω s s t turbulence model with the vof method shows reasonably good performance in predicting both surface elevations and wave forces on the vertical cylinder 4 2 averaged velocity profiles fig 10 shows the comparison of time averaged horizontal velocities with different turbulence models at location v see fig 1 the position of v is located in the flat bottom section of the nwt at x 25 m the vertical axis denotes the vertical coordinates in the nwt the horizontal axis represents the values of averaged horizontal velocities at location v all the numerical models can capture the basic variation of the averaged horizontal velocity it is negative throughout the majority of the water column and becomes positive near the free water surface the mean velocities are small near the bottom of the water column and increase gradually when the position approaches the free surface meanwhile negative velocity gradients are observed as the water depth increases when using the no turbulence model stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 turbulence model and modified stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 0 turbulence model while velocity gradients are positive for the k ω s s t turbulence model and the realizable k ε turbulence model at the same location as aforementioned the function of the buoyancy term is to avoid the large production of turbulent kinetic energy due to the unbalanced pressure gradient and density gradient between the water and air phases at the free surface it means that the buoyancy term mainly affects the flow characteristics near the free surface therefore the time averaged horizontal velocity profiles calculated by turbulence models with buoyancy term stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 and the buoyancy modified k ω s s t α β s 1 176 show similar trend near the free surface see the free surface region in fig 10 while the stress limiter coefficient can affect the entire flow field this can be verified by comparing the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 and the modified stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 0 which shows the similar time averaged horizontal velocity profiles under the free surface see the region of z 1 5 m in fig 10 eventually when the buoyancy modification coefficient and the stress limiter coefficient are employed simultaneously in the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 the time averaged horizontal velocity profile is almost same with that in the case of no turbulence model in the vicinity and underneath the free surface 4 3 turbulent behavior in order to identify the turbulent behaviour of the different turbulence models contours of the turbulent kinetic energy k around the breaking point are depicted in fig 11 the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 turbulence model and the buoyancy modified k ω s s t α β s 1 176 turbulence model show very small values of tke in the entire fluid domain before the wave breaking see fig 11 a and b this is attributed to the function of the limiter inside the buoyancy term of tke equation the positions of wave breaking points predicted by the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 turbulence model and the buoyancy modified k ω s s t α β s 1 176 turbulence model are ahead of the other turbulence models the tke predicted by the modified stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 0 turbulence model presents a high value on the wave crest of the breaking point fig 11 c however the largest tke is obtained from the k ω s s t turbulence model near the free surface which can be seen in fig 11 d it causes that the total kinetic energy is diffused and dissipated during the wave propagation finally the breaking point predicted by the k ω s s t turbulence model is beyond the breaking points predicted by the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 turbulence model the buoyancy modified k ω s s t α β s 1 176 turbulence model and the modified stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 0 turbulence model fig 11 d shows that the position of wave breaking point predicted by the k ω s s t model is at the front surface of the vertical cylinder which is consistent with the predictions by bihs et al 2016 kamath et al 2016 and choi et al 2015 as well as the experimental data by irschik et al 2005 in the realizable k ε turbulence model the more kinetic energy is converted into tke in the entire fluid domain see fig 11 e the total kinetic energy loss makes the wave to reach the cylinder without breaking this is consistent with the aforementioned discussion that the surface elevation and the breaking wave force predicted by the realizable k ε turbulence model are underestimated as compared to the experimental data furthermore contours of the turbulent kinematic viscosity ν t using different turbulence models are depicted in fig 12 in the cases of the turbulence models with buoyancy modified term see fig 12 a and b ν t around the free surface goes to zero when the stress limiter coefficient λ 2 is also employed see fig 12 a ν t is zero not only on the free surface but also inside the fluid before the breaking point this means that there is no obvious turbulent effect in the flow field before the breaking point the performance of the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 and the no turbulence model are almost identical in terms of the surface elevations at location wg the wave forces on the cylinder and the locations of breaking points the comparison between fig 12 c and d shows that the stress limiter coefficient λ 2 significantly reduces ν t in the entire flow field the buoyancy modification coefficient α β s mainly affects the ν t on the free surface based on the comparison of fig 12 b and d the realizable k ε turbulence model predicts relatively large ν t in the active flow field leading to the non breaking wave before reaching the cylinder in summary both the stress limiter coefficient λ 2 and the buoyancy modification coefficient α β s have an important influence on predictions of free surface elevation breaking wave force tke and ν t the turbulence models with the buoyancy modified term give more physical tke i e no turbulence before wave breaking and relatively large turbulence intensity in the post breaking zone behind the cylinder however the predicted breaking wave forces are smaller than that of the experimental data this may be due to the properties of the vof method the vof method usually results in a large air velocity at the free surface due to the continuity condition at the interface of water and air phases liu et al 2020 this problem can be potentially improved by the large turbulence intensity produced by the k ω s s t turbulence model therefore the k ω s s t turbulence model performs well on the surface elevation and the breaking wave force despite overestimating levels of tke the realizable k ε turbulence model over predicts the tke and under estimates the breaking wave force 5 conclusions and discussion in this paper different rans turbulence models with the vof method have been evaluated for investigating the interaction between the breaking waves and the vertical cylinder the main conclusions in the present study can be drawn as follows 1 the position of the breaking point has a significant effect on the breaking wave force on the cylinder the slight change in the wave front shape may lead to a large difference in the wave forces on the cylinder 2 the stabilized k ω s s t turbulence model λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 performs almost the same as no turbulence model for predicting breaking wave forces the wave breaks before hitting the vertical cylinder and the predicted breaking wave forces are smaller than the corresponding experimental data the realizable k ε turbulence model under predicts the surface elevation and the breaking wave force on the cylinder 3 the turbulence models with the buoyancy modified term the stabilized k ω s s t λ 2 0 05 α β s 1 36 and the buoyancy modified k ω s s t α β s 1 176 significantly reduce the turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent kinematic viscosity in the flow field showing more physical turbulence behavior before the wave breaking 4 the k ω s s t turbulence model accurately predicts the free surface elevations and the breaking wave forces as compared to the published experimental data however the level of the turbulent kinetic energy is overestimated especially at the wave crest 5 the buoyancy modification coefficient mainly affects the flow characteristics at the free surface while the stress limiter coefficient can affect the flow characteristics in the entire flow field it appears that none of the aforementioned turbulence models perform perfectly for predicting breaking waves past a vertical cylinder the stabilized and buoyancy modified k ω s s t models are more capable of turbulence intensity prediction the combination of the vof method and the k ω s s t turbulence model seems to give a reasonable prediction on the breaking point which eventually predicts the wave forces well even though the turbulent kinetic energy is overestimated at the wave crest credit authorship contribution
