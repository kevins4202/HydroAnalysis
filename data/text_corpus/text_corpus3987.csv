19935,over the last 15 years urine treatment technologies have developed from lab studies of a few pioneers to an interesting innovation attracting attention from a growing number of process engineers in this broad review we present literature from more than a decade on biological physical chemical and electrochemical urine treatment processes like in the first review on urine treatment from 2006 we categorize the technologies according to the following objectives stabilization volume reduction targeted n recovery targeted p recovery nutrient removal sanitization and handling of organic micropollutants we add energy recovery as a new objective because extensive work has been done on electrochemical energy harvesting especially with bio electrochemical systems our review reveals that biological processes are a good choice for urine stabilization they have the advantage of little demand for chemicals and energy due to instabilities however they are not suited for bathroom applications and they cannot provide the desired volume reduction on their own a number of physical chemical treatment technologies are applicable at bathroom scale and can provide the necessary volume reduction but only with a steady supply of chemicals and often with high demand for energy and maintenance electrochemical processes is a recent but rapidly growing field which could give rise to exciting technologies at bathroom scale although energy production might only be interesting for niche applications the review includes a qualitative assessment of all unit processes a quantitative comparison of treatment performance was not the goal of the study and could anyway only be done for complete treatment trains an important next step in urine technology research and development will be the combination of unit processes to set up and test robust treatment trains we hope that the present review will help guide these efforts to accelerate the development towards a mature technology

radiation wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction the community of wastewater professionals has worked on the concept of urine source separation since the mid 1990 ties with the double purpose of water pollution control and recycling of nutrients mainly for agriculture in an early critical review of potential urine treatment technologies maurer et al 2006 defined seven process engineering objectives to reach the double purpose of water pollution control and reuse of nutrients in agriculture stabilization volume reduction targeted n recovery targeted p recovery nutrient removal sanitization and handling of organic micropollutants in the present review we take up this structure adding the goal of energy recovery the rationale of urine source separation for improved water pollution control is based on the fact that urine provides most of the nitrogen and phosphorus contained in household wastewater larsen and gujer 1996 the large emissions of nitrogen and phosphorus are considered some of the most critical global environmental challenges with a high risk of destabilizing the earth s ecosystem mainly due to eutrophication in fresh water ecosystems and coastal areas steffen et al 2015 separate collection and treatment of urine combined with small compact wastewater treatment plants wwtps for the remaining wastewater removes nutrients as efficiently as the most advanced wwtps for mixed wastewater known today wilsenach and van loosdrecht 2006 at a global scale this is important because only around 10 of the world s population has access to nutrient eliminating wwtps larsen 2011 further about two thirds of the pharmaceuticals excreted by the human metabolism and about half of the corresponding eco toxicological potential of those pharmaceuticals are contained in urine lienert et al 2007a lienert et al 2007b with increasing concern about organic micropollutants in aquatic ecosystems eggen et al 2014 there would be benefits from removing pharmaceuticals from the aquatic ecosystems through urine separation nutrient recovery from urine can simplify the recycling of nutrients from the human metabolism to agriculture in the case of phosphorus food security as well as the environment would strongly benefit from recycling strategies because of the increasing economic and environmental costs of phosphorus mining cordell and neset 2014 in the case of nitrogen a freely available resource from the atmosphere there are three main arguments for recycling from urine energy demand economic value and reducing the emissions of hazardous nitrogen compounds to the environment removal of nitrogen from wastewater and production of nitrogen fertilizer are both energy intensive processes maurer et al 2003 dependent upon technologies recycling of nitrogen from urine can be more energy efficient than removal from wastewater and subsequent industrial fertilizer production economically nitrogen is by far the most valuable nutrient in urine etter et al 2011 where fertilizers are expensive or even unavailable for farmers especially in low income countries urine may be a cost effective substitute andersson et al 2013 many recycling technologies provide additional nutrients like phosphorus potassium and sulfur with high importance for the quality of the crops jönsson and vinneras 2013 on wwtps nitrous oxide emissions have recently proven much more important than expected often surpassing the climate effect of co2 emissions from electricity demand at the plants gruber et al 2020 as pointed out by steffen et al 2015 curbing the production of reactive nitrogen and the associated production of climate gases during the entire lifetime of the compound is one of the most important goals of the 21st century with a global excretion of around 30 mt yr 1 of nitrogen in urine roughly 10 g p 1 d 1 a recycling strategy could contribute significantly to reducing the requirements for industrially produced reactive nitrogen which is at present around 120 mt yr 1 razon 2018 the quality of a recycled product from urine must align with the requirements of the customers in most cases farmers besides fertilizer value hygiene and stability are therefore important factors defining quality although the removal of organic micropollutants is disputed based on the comparison with animal manure which equally contains organic micropollutants hammer and clemens 2007 at least in switzerland it is required for urine based fertilizers intended for edible crops www vuna ch aurin since the first overview article on urine treatment technologies was published by maurer et al 2006 more targeted review articles have been published however none of them provides a structured overview of the available technologies to reach the treatment goals of urine source separation a number of reviews have occurred with a focus on implementation in low income countries rahman et al 2015 simha and ganesapillai 2017 and more specific reviews have been published on selected technologies for urine treatment kabdaşlı and tünay 2018 focus on struvite precipitation ion exchange and adsorption patel et al 2020 give a detailed overview of membrane and electrochemical technologies and finally chipako and randall 2020 present technologies optimizing nutrient recovery with a focus on the ph dependence of these technologies for more in depth discussions than we are able to provide in this comprehensive review we refer to these specific reviews in a recent paper larsen et al 2021 discuss the requirements for global diffusion of the radical innovation of urine source separation the two most important technical elements defined are 1 mass produced urine separating toilets adapted to the socio economic environment and 2 mass produced treatment technology while a new toilet technology for high income countries entered the market already and several versions are in development for low income countries this present review discusses the state of the art of treatment technology development for the complex socio economic aspects of global diffusion we refer to larsen et al 2021 2 composition of fresh and stored urine there is a huge difference between the properties of fresh and stored urine whereas fresh urine contains a high concentration of urea this compound is rapidly hydrolyzed to ammonia and carbon dioxide as soon as urine enters the non sterile environment leading to the release of ammonia and bicarbonate and causing a ph increase udert et al 2006 equation 1 h 2 n c o n h 2 2 h 2 o n h 3 n h 4 h c o 3 the most relevant compounds in urine are nutrients and organic micropollutants with concentrations in fresh urine mainly depending on diet and medication respectively the concentration of heavy metals is so low that it is not an issue ronteltap et al 2007a but due to cross contamination from faeces source separated urine can contain pathogens bischel et al 2015a höglund et al 1998 the ph increase observed in stored urine leads to precipitation processes altering the concentration of a number of ions most importantly a substantial decrease in phosphorus concentration of around 30 and a nearly complete removal of calcium and magnesium ions udert et al 2003 these precipitation processes depend on the composition of fresh urine but also on the amount and composition of co separated flush water especially the calcium and magnesium content during urine collection and storage in ventilated rising pipes and tanks volatilization of ammonia can lead to substantial nitrogen loss siegrist et al 2013 in table 1 we list values for ph electrical conductivity and concentrations in undiluted fresh and stored urine please note that in practice source separated urine is often diluted with some flushing water on average the production of urine is 1 4 l p 1 d 1 dwa 2016 3 stabilization of urine following maurer et al 2006 urine stabilization includes processes which i degrade organic matter thus preventing malodor ii prevent volatilization of nh3 and iii prevent unwanted precipitation which can result in operational problems such as pipe clogging or membrane fouling 3 1 biological processes for stabilization biological stabilization primarily aims at reducing the ph value of urine through nitrification and fulfills the goal of removing most of the organic matter including malodorous compounds udert and wächter 2012 a biological process with its high enzymatic activity will rapidly convert any remaining urea to ammonium coppens et al 2016 and it thus makes no difference whether the substrate is fresh or stored urine however the nitrifying community will differ because not all nitrifying bacteria produce urease de paepe et al 2018 partial nitrification is the most frequent biological stabilization method but a number of authors used complete nitrification for the provision of a stabilized substrate for algae growth coppens et al 2016 feng et al 2008 section 4 4 or for the provision of a stabilized substrate for volume reduction by electrodialysis ed de paepe et al 2018 section 4 3 although ammonium and nitrite oxidation are normally unproblematic in conventional wastewater treatment high concentrations of salt moussa et al 2006 free ammonia and nitrous acid anthonisen et al 1976 may limit the reaction rates in concentrated urine solutions and can lead to an imbalance between ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob udert and wächter 2012 3 1 1 partial nitrification of urine biological production of ammonium nitrate based on the alkalinity in urine only mainly originating from urea hydrolysis equation 1 nitrification results in approximately equal amounts of total ammonia nhtot and nitrate udert and wächter 2012 during ammonia oxidation ph decreases to a value of around 5 4 at which the activity of nitrosomonas eutropha the dominant aob in the process ceases due to energy limitations fumasoli et al 2015 keeping ph in a narrow range e g by controlling the inflow rate of urine udert and wächter 2012 is the key to stable nitrate production otherwise partial nitrification may result in ammonium nitrite section 6 1 1 according to the literature until 2019 stable partial nitrification has only been achieved in biofilm reactors table 2 but at similar nitrification rates per surface as in municipal wastewater systems sørensen and morgenroth 2020 cite values between 0 5 and 2 5 gn m 2 d 1 in the early works on urine nitrification emphasis was not on optimization but on feasibility feng et al 2008 and stability of the process udert and wächter 2012 with the latter process running stable for 12 months in a long running pilot plant fumasoli et al 2016 found that the nitrification rate was inversely correlated with the inlet nhtot concentration table 2 showing that the inhibition by salt and or free ammonia is in fact relevant for urine nitrification based on typical daily nitrogen excretions in urine table 1 this results in a reactor size of around 50 l p 1 for the highly concentrated urine and around 10 l p 1 for the more diluted urine with a trade off between reactor size for partial nitrification and energy demand of subsequent evaporation processes section 4 1 the major challenge for the stability of partial nitrification is inhibition of nob by nitrous acid caused by accumulation of nitrite fumasoli et al 2016 another challenge is the growth of acid tolerant aob when urine nitrification is operated at low ph values if acid tolerant aob are allowed to grow in they may cause a ph decrease to values as low as 2 2 resulting in emission of large amounts of hazardous volatile nitrogen compounds such as no n2o no2 and hno2 with detrimental effects on air quality and climate and a loss of acid sensitive nitrifiers fumasoli et al 2017 while it is easy to keep ph within narrow bands there is a lack of methods to monitor and control the nitrite concentration mašić et al 2015 an additional research gap exists with respect to the emission of nitrous oxides during normal operation a problem that has gained increased importance for conventional wastewater treatment gruber et al 2020 3 1 2 complete nitrification of urine biological production of nitrate complete nitrification i e oxidation of all ammonia to nitrate is only possible by providing additional alkalinity this has been proven in biofilm systems as well as in reactors with suspended biomass at a ph between 6 5 and 8 table 2 like in the case of partial nitrification section 3 1 1 we observe higher nitrification rates at higher dilution of urine coppens et al 2016 showed the importance of a halotolerant inoculum which halved the start up time as compared to an inoculum from a wwtp unfortunately this did not lead to a higher final reaction rate indicating that long term adaptation to high salt concentrations is difficult especially for the ammonia oxidizers identified by the authors as less tolerant to high salt concentrations than the nitrite oxidizers the observed inhibition by salt is supported by the comparable low process rates found by mackey et al 2014 who diluted urine with seawater instead of tap water as done in comparable experiments jiang et al 2011 for many practical purposes of complete nitrification especially heterotrophic denitrification in sewers dilution with tap water is unproblematic and the optimal dilution is therefore of less importance than for partial nitrification where volume reduction is most often intended see section 3 1 1 for a discussion of the trade offs between dilution and volume reduction in fact using a larger water volume for urine flushing will easily achieve sufficient dilution of ammonia and salt except in places like hong kong where toilets are flushed with seawater for practical implementation especially in on site settings dosing of alkalinity is the main challenge oosterhuis and van loosdrecht 2009 3 2 chemical processes for stabilization chemical stabilization of urea inhibits the enzyme responsible for its degradation and prevents a ph increase in the first place equation 1 ray et al 2018 found that fluoride ionic zinc and ionic silver were ineffective whereas acid proved effective as already discussed by maurer et al 2006 the technologies of alkaline section 3 2 2 and electrochemical stabilization section 3 3 have only emerged after 2006 little new literature is available on neutralization of stored urine with acid section 3 2 1 and filtration and precipitation to prevent fouling of synthetic membranes included in section 4 2 3 2 1 acid dosage while antonini et al 2012 found neutralization of stored urine with strong acid effective but too dangerous to implement in a simple setting in vietnam jiang et al 2017 established a quantitative relationship between ph value and ammonia loss for a distillation process on acidified stored urine with 99 5 n recovery at ph 4 and less than 50 at ph 7 as already discussed in maurer et al 2006 however neutralization of stored urine requires large amounts of acid due to the high alkalinity of urine after urea hydrolysis table 1 for the more economic urea stabilization in fresh urine ray et al 2018 found that weak acids like acetic acid citric acid and vinegar could be used for the inhibition of urea hydrolysis in the concentration range of 32 130 meq l 1 for short term inhibition of urea hydrolysis in a building urine collecting system saetta et al 2019 used predictive modeling combined with real time conductivity and ph data for dosing acetic acid in order to keep a low ph around 4 low urination volumes and frequencies led to the highest degree of hydrolysis i e the highest demand for acetic acid whereas high urination volumes and frequency led to less mixing and less time for hydrolysis in the pipes in the international space station iss sulfuric acid has been used for stabilization in combination with 0 56 chromium trioxide but even these harsh conditions could not totally prevent fungal growth which was the primary cause for biofouling and damaged hardware observed in the urine processing assembly birmele et al 2009a birmele et al 2009b 3 2 2 base dosage alkaline stabilization of urea is the alternative to acidic stabilization randall et al 2016 compared three chemicals for reaching a ph above 11 necessary for urease inhibition in urine calcium oxide calcium carbonate and slaked lime of those chemicals slaked lime i e ca oh 2 proved to be the only suitable one with the additional advantage of low cost and low solubility allowing the right amount to dissolve from a large amount added to a urine container randall et al 2016 an additional advantage of this stabilization process is that it leads to immediate p precipitation which may result in the production of a separate p fertilizer section 5 2 1 an alternative to direct alkaline stabilization in liquid urine is the same process in a dry bed dutta and vinneras 2016 showed that a mixture of ca oh 2 and wood ash 1 1 would keep the ph value of fresh urine above 10 which in this solid mixture was deemed enough to retain urea although some ammonia losses occurred senecal and vinneras 2017 even reached ph values higher than 10 with wood ash alone simha et al 2018a showed that the concept of an anion exchanger resin could potentially work exchanging oh ions against cl ions for providing additional base to fresh urine prior to these processes but up to 2019 we have seen no follow up projects an aspect of high significance for liquid and dry alkaline stabilization alike is the stability of the ph value once obtained senecal and vinneras 2017 observed that co2 adsorption from the air led to a critical ph decrease simha et al 2018a suggested that besides co2 absorption buffering of alkaline earth metals and nhtot formation from urea degradation lead to a ph decrease the most important research gap for alkaline stabilization is thus the setup of a system which effectively prevents co2 uptake from air thereby inducing a critical positive feedback mechanism due to increased urea hydrolysis in section 4 we will discuss the volume reduction of stabilized urine for fertilizer production an alternative usage for alkaline stabilized urine would be the production of bricks through mixing with sand and urease producing base tolerant bacteria henze and randall 2018 lambert and randall 2019 the carbonate produced through urea hydrolysis combines with calcium and the resulting calcium carbonate cements the sand particles together allowing for the production of a low cost building material with a compressive strength comparable to the strength of conventional bricks 3 3 electrochemical processes for stabilization electrochemical processes have been used to stabilize urine by removing organic substances preventing urea hydrolysis or inactivating microorganisms in this section we discuss mainly urine stabilization in electrolysis cells ec removal of organic substances has also been investigated to a large extent with microbial fuel cells mfc with the benefit of producing electricity see section 7 in most studies on urine electrolysis indirect oxidation with chlorine is the main mechanism for removal of organics and nitrogen compounds and sometimes nacl was even added to boost the oxidation process chun et al 2018 ikematsu et al 2006 chlorine is a potent oxidant which is produced by the oxidation of chloride besides chlorine hydroxyl radicals are important oxidants especially in the case of boron doped diamond electrodes bdd zöllig et al 2017 conducted batch experiments in the lab to investigate the electrolysis of real stored urine using either bdd or a titanium anode with a thermally decomposed iro2 film tdirof see also section 6 2 on nitrogen removal on both electrodes fast removal of organic substances started right from the beginning of the experiments actually at the start of the experiment cod removal was preferred over ammonia oxidation on bdd the cod degradation rates were 10 to 50 times higher than rates observed in biofilm systems or in mfc see table 3 however the energy demand is very high actually mfc might be an interesting alternative for cod removal the degradation rates are similar to the maximum rates observed in conventional biofilm systems and the electricity produced could be used for process monitoring while indirect oxidation with free chlorine can be a fast and efficient removal process for organics nitrogen compounds section 6 2 pharmaceuticals and pathogens section 8 the process can be problematic due to the formation of chlorinated by products cbps which can be hazardous for the environment and human health zöllig et al 2015c dbira et al 2015 and zöllig et al 2017 reported that chloride was nearly completely removed due to the formation of cbps zöllig et al 2015c examined the fate of the organic cbps dichloromethane trichloromethane tetrachloromethane 1 2 dichloroethane 1 2 dichloropropane and chlorobenzene and the inorganic cbps chlorate and perchlorate during electrolysis on bdd and tdirof perchlorate and chlorate were the dominant cbps consuming more than 90 of the initial chloride most of the organic cbps were stripped to the air thereby posing a health hazard 4 nutrient recovery by volume reduction volume reduction typically results in the recovery of several nutrients the technologies of interest rely on evaporation membrane processes including ed a combination of membrane technology and electrochemistry and the uptake of nutrients in algae 4 1 drying and distillation processes distillation and drying both rely on evaporation but whereas water in the distillation process is re condensed with the possibility to recover water and some of the high evaporation energy of around 700 wh l 1 udert and wächter 2012 this normally does not happen in a drying process evaporation essentially concentrates all non volatile compounds in urine with the large advantage of keeping also micronutrients in the fertilizer product harder et al 2019 but also with potential negative consequences if organic micropollutants are not removed along the process chain section 8 2 there is always a risk of some ammonia volatilization but depending on the effectivity of the preceding stabilization process section 3 and the process configuration this loss can be minimized drying has mainly been suggested for on site settings in the bathroom after on site alkaline stabilization the process can profit from high air temperatures but as shown by randall et al 2016 alkaline stabilized urea becomes chemically unstable at temperatures above 40 c dutta and vinneras 2016 and senecal and vinneras 2017 evaporated alkaline stabilized urine by applying a forced air stream to a drying bed based on wood ash senecal and vinneras 2017 obtained more than 80 nitrogen recovery at an evaporation temperature of 35 c resulting in a solid product with up to 7 8 n 2 5 p and 10 9 k by weight comparable to commercial npk fertilizers the corresponding high loss of ammonia to the atmosphere obviously calls for process improvements in a similar study simha et al 2018a established that higher temperatures led to higher evaporation rates but that a higher air flow rate was only beneficial within limits and a deeper bed was counterproductive due to the instability of urea at temperatures above 40 c there are clear limits for the improvement of rates based on temperature udert and wächter 2012 investigated water removal from partially nitrified urine section 3 1 1 by distillation in a small lab scale evaporator at 78 c and 200 mbar resulting in a dry product or a highly concentrated liquid product fumasoli et al 2016 describe the application of this process in a commercial distillation reactor with vapor compression and heat recovery resulting in a concentrated nutrient solution with concentrations w w of around 5 n 0 2 p and 2 k the energy demand of distillation was around 110 wh l 1 as compared to around 710 wh l 1 for the evaporation of water without energy recovery equally important is that the small loss of nitrogen is contained in the distillate and therefore not emitted to the atmosphere distillation of acid stabilized fresh urine is possible carter et al 2013 as is distillation of fresh urine without stabilization lefebvre et al 2015 but in the latter case obviously only for a short time until urea hydrolysis becomes substantial we have found no attempts to use distillation for urine stabilized at a high ph value though high ammonia losses are to be expected due to chemical urea hydrolysis at high temperatures and high ph values randall et al 2016 the advantage of drying is the applicability at bathroom scale but there are still important research gaps with respect to energy recovery and reduction of ammonia losses the obvious advantages of distillation is energy recovery and the capture of ammonia in the distillate where it will not lead to air contamination distillation is a well established commercial process but if it is to be downscaled more explorative processes like membrane distillation md section 4 2 2 could be more promising 4 2 membrane processes the membrane processes applied for volume reduction are primarily forward osmosis fo and ed for the latter we refer to section 4 3 further md is an explorative alternative technology to conventional distillation section 4 1 ultrafiltration has proven an effective pre treatment step prior to the osmotic membrane processes intended for volume reduction removing up to 99 of the suspended solids in stored urine but with severe fouling problems of the membrane ouma et al 2016 for all membrane processes there are important differences between the treatment of fresh urine with nitrogen mainly contained in urea an uncharged molecule and the treatment of stored urine where nitrogen is mainly contained in the acid base pair nh4 nh3 all membrane applications suffer from fouling leading in many cases to short duration of the experiments this will be a major hurdle for on site applications of membrane treatment where regular cleaning of the membranes is difficult 4 2 1 forward osmosis fo with the technology of fo the rejection of nitrogen compounds volpin et al 2019 and the water flux liu et al 2016 increase with increasing concentration of the draw solution from table 4 summarizing the available results on the process we observe that high retention of all three main nutrients n p and k is possible as well as a high volume reduction of up to 85 however all authors applied the process only to synthetic urine and none obtained good results on all parameters those who used fresh urine report ph values of 6 7 where urea is not stable section 3 2 for stored urine we only observe good ammonia retention at a low ph values at which the concentration of nh3 is low requiring large amounts of acid for neutralization maurer et al 2006 all authors identified fouling as a major problem zhang et al 2014 reduced the problem by removal of precipitates prior to membrane treatment but only for an experimental duration of 70 hours 4 2 2 membrane distillation md in the md process the driving force is the vapor pressure difference produced by the temperature difference across a hydrophobic membrane only allowing volatile compounds to pass derese and verliefde 2016 from urine we would thus expect water vapor nh3 and volatile organic compounds to pass the membrane making the process suitable only for stabilized urine where the concentration of free ammonia is low as we will see however some new membrane developments may challenge this conventional wisdom the energy demand for md is slightly higher than for vapor compression distillation with heat recovery for example winter et al 2011 reported energy demands of 180 to 240 kwh m 3 for treating water with a salinity of 35 g kg 1 in spiral wound md modules while fumasoli et al 2016 reported 107 kwh m 3 for treating partially nitrified urine with vapor compression distillation and heat recovery the advantage of md over conventional vapor compression distillation could be the simpler setup and the possibility to use low grade heat instead of electricity derese and verliefde 2016 there is little experience with md of stabilized fresh urine ray et al 2019 came close by testing dcmd on a urea solution previously obtained from urine through an fo process the fo process resulted in incomplete selective mass transfer of urea but with some co transfer of cod in the md process on the urea solution urea recovery ranged from 72 92 and different stabilization methods had no effects on recovery despite the reduced cod content severe fouling of the membrane occurred strongly questioning the viability of md on fresh urine for stored urine tun et al 2016 showed that the permeation of nitrogen through the membrane is proportional to the concentration of free ammonia in the feed solution and negligible at ph 6 following chemical acidification the authors applied filtration to prevent fouling but with little effect xu et al 2019a suggested partial or full nitrification for stabilization which would have the additional advantage of removing a large portion of the cod with an unusual high ph of 8 3 after partial nitrification see section 3 1 1 only complete nitrification section 3 1 2 resulted in a high nitrogen retention of 94 but the experiments were too short to verify the anti fouling effects of biological treatment in general a major research gap for fo is the lack of long term experience especially with respect to fouling additionally like for the fo processes only stored urine with a low ph is suitable as feed requiring large amounts of acid for neutralization maurer et al 2006 in an alternative approach to deal with the poor rejection of ammonia by dcmd at high ph khumalo et al 2019 changed the membrane properties with nanoparticles creating smaller evenly distributed pores and a porous spongy structure in experiments on real stored urine without ph adjustment with a temperature difference of 30 c and using the most hydrophobic membranes produced the authors found 80 water recovery with a rejection rate for ammonia higher than 95 and similar rejection rates for total organic carbon toc potassium and sodium ions the authors attributed these highly interesting results to the dense porous structure which is able to trap the molecules during their travel through the membrane with reported low fouling potential and stable water flux rates over a period of 15 days further research on these modified membranes seems worthwhile 4 3 electrodialysis for volume reduction ed has been used to produce a concentrated solution of all ions in urine an electric field and at least one pair of an anion exchange membrane aem and a cation exchange membrane cem is needed in ed to concentrate all ions while for ammonium removal via ed only a cem is needed see section 5 1 3 in most studies on urine ed urine was in direct contact with the anode and the cathode the required voltage was produced by oxidizing reduced compounds especially cod the reactors were operated as microbial fuel cells mfc ed freguia et al 2019 gao et al 2018b lu et al 2019 microbial electrolysis cells mec ed ledezma et al 2017 brewster et al 2017 tice and kim 2014 or electrolysis cells ec ed jermakka et al 2018 in ec high voltages can result in unwanted cbps see section 3 3 pronk et al 2007 and de paepe et al 2018 used conventional electrodialysis and rinsed the electrodes with a sodium sulfate or sodium nitrate solution respectively in all ed processes except for mfc electric energy is needed to apply an external voltage in general the energy demand was low as compared to distillation see table 5 the lowest energy demand observed was 1 3 kwh kgn recovered 1 when concentrating diluted nitrified urine with conventional ed calculated from data by de paepe et al 2018 despite good concentration factors see table 5 up to 50 of nitrogen 61 of the phosphate and 45 of the potassium was lost mainly to the diluate higher concentrations factors are not to be expected because volume reduction is limited by osmotic and electro osmotic water transport into the concentrate pronk et al 2006a and back diffusion of ions from the concentrate into the diluate brewster et al 2017 besides lower energy demand removal of organic micropollutants is an advantage of ed compared to distillation see section 8 2 3 however it comes at the cost of a large share of the nutrients remaining in the diluate furthermore as for all membrane processes fouling is a problem to prevent fouling pronk et al 2007 and de paepe et al 2018 pre treated the influent with microfiltration in addition de paepe et al 2018 cleaned the membranes once a month 4 4 volume reduction through nutrient uptake in algae a biological process for volume reduction would be the uptake of nutrients in algae followed by separation and possibly a drying process with typical nitrogen concentrations w w of 0 92 in urine table 1 and 6 8 in algae dry matter tuantet et al 2013 and with typical algae dry matter contents around 25 da silva et al 2008 this would result in weight reductions of only a factor of 2 for wet but a factor of 8 for dried algae however in the literature we have found only experimental results for algae growth on urine which is already quite complex but no discussion of the following separation and drying processes in several studies urine functions as a nutrient source for producing algae either for use as a slow release fertilizer as an energy crop or for the production of other chemical products from algae despite a large variability in the literature with respect to urine dilution type of algae species and reactor operation the requirement for a culture medium additional to urine is universal urine cannot on its own support substantial algae growth due to a lack of micronutrients and a high n p ratio in fresh urine of approximately 28 1 as compared to the general requirements of algae of 16 1 leading to the requirement of p addition for quantitative n removal tuantet 2015 precipitation of p during storage further increases the n p ratio and removes essential compounds like mg and ca section 2 like biological stabilization section 3 1 algae growth suffers from inhibition through salt and nitrogen compounds especially free ammonia above 140 gn m 3 tuantet et al 2013 but also high nitrate concentrations above 1000 gn m 3 coppens et al 2016 undiluted urine is therefore not a suitable substrate the best long term results were obtained by tuantet et al 2014 who optimized a continuous photo bioreactor for more than 8 months at a ph of 7 with a minimum dilution factor of 2 and the addition of the missing nutrients the maximum n uptake rate was 1300 gn m 3 d 1 and the maximum p uptake rate 150 gp m 3 d 1 in addition to the rather unsuitable nutrient composition of urine for algae growth the setup of bioreactors is challenging due to low light penetration aggravated by the dark color of urine coppens et al 2016 to overcome inhibition and improve light penetration bioreactors are typically set up for diluted urine tuantet et al 2019 showed that continuous microalgae cultivation in a photobioreactor with a light path of 5 mm is possible but that there is an inherent conflict between quantitative nitrogen removal and photosynthetic efficiency when treating urine at reasonable nitrogen concentrations between 0 77 and 2 6 g l 1 the shorter the hydraulic retention time hrt the higher the dilution factor of urine in order to prevent inhibition of the algae by free ammonia with increasing hrt both biomass concentration and nutrient removal increases but at a certain point depending on the length of the light path photosynthetic efficiency decreases due to the high biomass concentration optimizing the system would thus demand even shorter light paths than used in this study an enormous challenge for the open raceway ponds normally suggested for algae growth this was confirmed by chatterjee et al 2019 in a pilot study of a 0 5 m deep raceway pond where extremely high dilution was required even for only 50 nitrogen recovery based on the daily nitrogen excretion in urine reported in section 2 such a plant would have a footprint of 3 m2 p 1 i e 15 ha for a middle sized town of 50 000 inhabitants and is therefore hardly a realistic option apart from the challenges concerning post processing the development of a realistic photobioreactor is thus the most important research gap in the area of volume reduction of urine through algae growth 5 targeted nutrient recovery targeted nutrient recovery is primarily directed at the pollution relevant nutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p while only little efforts have been directed towards potassium k 5 1 targeted n recovery nitrogen is the most important nutrient in urine it has the highest economic value etter et al 2011 and it is responsible for the increased size and complexity of nutrient eliminating plants as well as for most of the climate effects energy demand and n2o emissions gruber et al 2020 larsen 2015 based on four papers on urine treatment maurer et al 2006 presented three technologies for targeted nitrogen recovery air stripping followed by ammonia absorption in distilled water ion exchange on zeolites and precipitation with isobutylaldehyde diurea ibdu while the ibdu precipitation was inefficient and did not lead to any follow up projects the technologies of air stripping and ion exchange have developed considerably since then 5 1 1 stripping for targeted n recovery stored urine with its high concentration of ammonia at a ph around 9 3 section 2 is highly favorable for an air stripping process morales et al 2013 showed that stored urine can be added to digester supernatant for ammonia removal but the high phosphate concentrations in urine can lead to critical precipitation table 6 provides an overview of literature results on air stripping of nitrogen from urine p removal usually precedes the stripping process to prevent problems by clogging air stripping of ammonia is facilitated by high ph and high temperature both pushing the acid base equilibrium towards volatile free ammonia basakçılardan kabakcı et al 2007 liu et al 2015 as observed from table 6 different authors have different priorities with respect to resource demand i e chemicals for ph increase and energy and removal efficiency of the process in some cases there are special reasons for these priorities pradhan et al 2017 for instance combined p removal and n stripping by increasing ph with ca oh 2 thereby inducing the precipitation of calcium phosphates section 5 2 1 in a combination of experimental work and modeling liu et al 2015 found a strong positive correlation of air stripping efficiency within the following boundaries ph 9 3 10 temperature 23 50 c and air flow rate 1 4 lair h 1 lurine 1 dilution hardly influenced the percentage of ammonia removal indicating an approximate linear correlation between ammonia concentration and process efficiency assuming that resource consumption is more or less proportional to the volume stream treated the model provides a first useful tool to weigh resource demand against nitrogen stripping efficiency according to the preferences of the stakeholders emerging technologies challenging conventional ammonia stripping are vacuum thermal stripping tao et al 2019 tian et al 2019 membrane stripping christiaens et al 2019b pradhan et al 2019 and md derese and verliefde 2016 common for these technologies is that they do not need an air stream for ammonia transfer potentially simplifying the technical setup but all technologies are still experimental christiaens et al 2019b performed a comparison with conventional stripping and found that direct liquid liquid transfer from a concentrated urine solution through a hydrophobic gas membrane could halve the energy demand required for the same result from air stripping for conventional and emerging stripping technologies the typical absorption medium is sulfuric acid boehler et al 2015 recommend a 14 m h2so4 solution to reach a 40 salt solution with 100 gn l 1 avoiding crystallization of ammonium sulfate with around 9 2 gn l 1 in undiluted urine table 1 this corresponds to a volume reduction of more than a factor of 10 however many authors use 0 5 2 m acids leading to highly dilute solutions table 6 and a higher stripping temperature leads to a higher co transfer rate of water pradhan et al 2017 in the case of vacuum thermal stripping co evaporation is so high that tao et al 2019 successfully installed a demister resulting in crystallization even in a 2 5 m h2so4 solution efficient ammonia recovery requires low ph values and typically the ph value of the absorber medium is used for control however for instance xu et al 2017 only stopped the adsorption process at ph 9 3 which resulted in 24 nitrogen loss to the atmosphere for air stripping of ammonia a combination of counter currently operated packed column stripper and absorber is standard technology antonini et al 2011 successfully improved the design by introducing recirculation of the air stream between the two columns to avoid nitrogen losses and recirculation of urine around the stripping column to improve mass transfer pradhan et al 2017 reduced ammonia loss by installing two serial absorbers we only found one example of a pilot plant running successful for 80 days wei et al 2018 achieving more than 90 nhtot removal at an hrt in the order of 5 5 6 3 minutes independently of dilution however despite air recirculation as recommended above nitrogen recovery was only 93 the main critical issue of stripping however is the required large scale of application although antonini et al 2011 applied a flow rate as low as 10 l h 1 of undiluted urine this flow rate applied 24 7 would correspond to treating the urine from more than 150 people the only long term pilot plant was run at a loading rate of 7 8 m3 h 1 of urine diluted by a factor of 4 wei et al 2018 which would correspond to treating the urine of more than 30 000 people in order to be relevant at the scale of an apartment building a small scale column setup and automatic control system would be necessary while the emerging alternatives discussed above avoid at least the air stripping column and therefore seem simpler and better suited for small scale application these technologies are still only experimental 5 1 2 adsorption processes for targeted n recovery whereas ammonia stripping is associated with large scale columns the adsorption technology with no moving parts seems perfect for small scale applications maurer et al 2006 already reported first experience with ion exchange on zeolites for targeted nhtot recovery from stored urine and in fact zeolites are still by far the preferred adsorption material for targeted n recovery because zeolites are excellent soil conditioners for increasing nutrient and water retention of poor soils ramesh and reddy 2011 the product is always intended directly as fertilizer as is biochar another absorber material used for nitrogen recovery for a thorough discussion of adsorption mechanisms and an overview of the experimental results see the excellent review of kabdaşlı and tünay 2018 only tarpeh et al 2017 have tested other adsorbents for nitrogen recovery table 7 for biochar maximum adsorption densities in real urine is similar to the ones for zeolites whereas some synthetic cation exchange resins were more effective reaching a maximal ammonium adsorption density of up to 64 mgn g 1 a factor 7 weight reduction this is substantial and although slightly lower than for stripping the technology is simpler for small scale installations the price for the higher adsorption capacity is the requirement for a subsequent regeneration step preferably with a strong acid with the extent of desorption widely depending on the adsorbent material tarpeh et al 2017 this also sets a limit to the lifetime of the synthetic material there are few examples of an installation of ion exchangers beyond the lab recently tarpeh et al 2018b did a first successful pilot installation of the synthetic resin dowex mac 3 for ammonium recovery in kenya in cooperation with the social enterprise sanergy this first pilot phase showed similar adsorption densities as in the lab but only a longer term installation will reveal the sustainability of the business model nitrogen in the form of urea is the only non ionic nutrient in urine until now one group of researchers have tested the adsorption of urea to biochar with results ranging from highly surprising 750 mgurea g 1 in batch experiments ganesapillai et al 2015 to more realistic 94 mgurea g 1 44 mgn g 1 in column experiments simha et al 2018b these and similar experiments were all conducted at neutral ph where urea is not stable and some hydrolysis may have interfered with the urea measurements for practical purposes results from urea stabilized urine section 3 2 will be required in order to compare adsorption of urea and ammonium on biochar the latter as reported in table 7 and to evaluate whether the additional stabilization is worth the effort 5 1 3 electrochemical processes for targeted n recovery ed has frequently been used to move ammonium from urine towards a cathode for subsequent recovery in this application of ed only a cem is needed which allows the selective migration of cations including ammonium to the cathode fig 1 the high ph value at the cathode can then be used for ammonia stripping either with air or through membranes see section 5 1 1 the electric field required for ed can be produced with a mfc kuntke et al 2012 mec kuntke et al 2018 kuntke et al 2017 ledezma et al 2017 rodríguez arredondo et al 2019 zamora et al 2017b or ec system christiaens et al 2019a christiaens et al 2017 luther et al 2015 tarpeh et al 2018a kuntke et al 2012 reported that the coulombic efficiency in an mfc was only 10 i e only 10 of the electrons released from cod degradation contributed to the electric current and thereby to cation transport in the electric field furthermore only 31 of the current was used for ammonium transport while most of the current was used to transport other cations such as sodium potassium and protons kuntke et al 2017 however the low transport of ammonium was somewhat compensated by the diffusion of uncharged free ammonia in the study of kuntke et al 2012 at least 42 of the nhtot was transported via free ammonia diffusion the contribution of free ammonia diffusion became actually the dominant ammonia transport mechanism at low current densities the same research group showed that the electro migration of ammonium can be substantially enhanced with mecs zamora et al 2017a reported that 92 of nhtot was transported through the cem this high electro migration of ammonium correlated with a high coulombic efficiency of 70 the process was also faster than in the mfc study kuntke et al 2012 because the current densities were up to 100 times higher 50 a m 2 after moving the ammonium to the cathode it must be stripped from the cathode chamber by air stripping e g kuntke et al 2012 or through a membrane to be absorbed in an acid e g zamora et al 2017a and tarpeh et al 2018a the study by zamora et al 2017a showed that the limiting step for final ammonia recovery is not the removal of ammonia from urine but the capture of the removed ammonium in the acid while 92 of the total ammonia was transported through the cem only 31 was finally absorbed in sulfuric acid the highest nhtot recovery for real urine was reported by tarpeh et al 2018a when combining an ec ed with ammonia stripping through gas permeable membranes they could recover 93 of the nhtot in the acid in batch mode and 50 in continuous mode however they also showed that substantial amounts of ammonia can be lost by the oxidation with chlorine which can be formed at the anode kuntke et al 2017 actually presented a method to prevent chlorine formation at the anode by recycling hydrogen from the cathode to the anode high anode potentials could be prevented and thereby the production of chlorine and cbps furthermore the availability of hydrogen also reduced the consumption of organic compounds at the anode in most studies on electrochemical ammonia stripping a synthetic catholyte was used only in two studies christiaens et al 2017 christiaens et al 2019b was urine treated directly at the cathode after entering the cathode chamber it was directed into the anode chamber ammonia was later absorbed in sulfuric acid or in a solution with hydrogen oxidizing bacteria to produce microbial protein christiaens et al 2017 5 2 targeted p recovery based on the experience from conventional wastewater treatment precipitation is the natural process choice for targeted p recovery from urine although also anion exchange has been attempted it is not always clear if in fact ion exchange and not precipitation is at least partially responsible for the removal effects 5 2 1 precipitation processes for targeted p recovery in wastewater phosphate precipitates with iron aluminum magnesium and calcium ions these ions have equally proven successful for recovering phosphorus from urine but precipitation with mg2 is by far the most popular process for this purpose one reason for this may be the large focus on p recovery for fertilizer whereas magnesium ammonium phosphate map is recognized as a good plant fertilizer harder et al 2019 plant availability of iron and aluminum phosphate and possible toxicity of the latter is heavily debated see e g mocker et al 2011 however these simple technologies may prove suitable for collecting p at the source for later industrial fertilizer production table 8 lists the best results obtained from the literature for precipitation processes for p recovery from urine for map production the literature is extensive experimental evidence shows that particle formation is fast in the order of less than 20 seconds supported by the initial presence of small particles triger et al 2012 map solubility correlates positively with temperature ronteltap et al 2007b and particle size increases with decreasing super saturation βs i e with increasing temperature and decreasing ph and with increasing turbulence preventing water packets with high super saturation ronteltap et al 2010 rodrigues et al 2019 supported these findings and determined an optimum saturation index si log10 βs between 2 7 and 3 5 for simultaneously obtaining high phosphorus recovery and large particle sizes with a higher contact time supporting crystal growth for the other precipitation processes there is substantial less information in the literature precipitation of phosphate with aluminum is only successful at low ph values due to the formation of competing compounds table 8 in essence this means that only stabilized urine is suitable as substrate section 3 for the production of fepo4 there is less agreement in the literature in experiments using a sacrificial iron electrode for the dosing of iron zheng et al 2009 reported excellent results at ph 9 i e close to the ph of stored urine in an experiment dosing iron as fecl3 kabdaşlı et al 2019 found that above ph 7 5 the formation of fe oh 3 flocs rendered the process inefficient in the latter case again only stabilized urine would be a suitable substrate due to competing caco3 production precipitation of phosphate with ca2 is only recommended for fresh urine which contains negligible concentrations of bicarbonate table 8 the challenge of a practical reactor setup has been taken up only for map and magnesium potassium phosphate mpp precipitation table 9 see section 5 3 for mpp precipitation scaling problems in cstrs originally observed by wilsenach et al 2007 was solved by initial seeding and the establishment of a more distinct settling zone aguado et al 2019 particle separation in cstrs was only a major problem in the study of wei et al 2018 where small particles escaped the settling tank as well as the additional sieve zamora et al 2017a obtained the largest map crystals in a four phased fluidized bed reactor fbr reactor which was specifically designed for crystal growth with a decreasing flow rate along the vertical flow axis with online measurements of the p concentration in the influent to determine optimal mg2 dosing zhang et al 2017 used the same setup for mpp production and obtained even larger crystals at an optimized si of 3 0 for low income countries etter et al 2011 developed a low cost hand driven reactor with an external filtration system coarse nylon filter which was later automatized with good results by grau et al 2015 using online signals of turbidity or electric conductivity for optimizing magnesium dosage the choice of chemicals for precipitation is interesting from the aspect of costs and reactor setup for map production a large number of waste products have been employed aguado et al 2019 dai et al 2014 etter et al 2011 krähenbühl et al 2016 liu et al 2013 rubio rincón et al 2014 sakthivel et al 2012 all those sources provided mg2 as desired often giving rise to impurities in the struvite product but only wood ash would influence the fertilizer product negatively due to the high content of heavy metals sakthivel et al 2012 total costs depend on the local availability of the waste resources as well as on operational costs e g for precipitant dosing an alternative to using cheap waste products is thus to lower these operational costs e g by using sacrificial electrodes as done by hug and udert 2013 for dosing mg2 by zheng et al 2009 for dosing fe3 and by zheng et al 2010 for dosing al3 5 2 2 adsorption processes for targeted p recovery for the adsorption of phosphorus we have only found examples of anion exchange o neal and boyer 2013 and sendrowski and boyer 2013 tested the implementation of a commercial anion exchange resin loaded with hydrous ferric oxide nanoparticles sendrowski and boyer 2013 set up kinetic and equilibrium models for synthetic fresh and stored urine concluding that kinetics were faster for fresh than for stored synthetic urine but that in both cases the maximum adsorption capacity on the resin was around 5 2 mgpo4 g 1 corresponding to 0 17 mmolp g 1 in subsequent experiments in the same system on fresh and stored urine o neal and boyer 2013 found higher maximum adsorption capacities of 10 1 and 6 9 mgpo4 gresin 1 respectively and 92 phosphorus recovery during regeneration of the resin by a nacl naoh solution dox et al 2019 investigated the use of mgal or znal layered double hydroxides ldh to recover phosphorus from urine by ion exchange with the intention of direct use in agriculture as a slow release p fertilizer the authors obtained the best results with a mgal ldh with an adsorption capacity of 64 mgp gldh 1 for synthetic stored urine at ph 6 but with indications from experiments with a p solution that this value would be around 15 lower at a realistic ph value of stored urine this is still better than the 5 10 g mgp gionexchanger 1 cited above but we found no explicit discussion of the suitability of aluminum based ion exchangers for soil conditioning furthermore when it comes to weight reduction ion exchange cannot compete with precipitation kabdaşlı et al 2013 with respect to the complex production of synthetic anion exchangers it still has to be proven that a possibly simpler operation can compensate for the disadvantage of lower volume reduction in some cases we can attribute apparent adsorption to precipitation xu et al 2019b attempted to provide al3 ca2 fe3 and mg2 ions coated on biochar but this was only successful for the dosing of mg2 most probably due to precipitation equally ganrot et al 2008 reported apparent adsorption densities up to 10 mgp g 1 on the cation exchanger zeolite while ganrot 2012 attributes this effect to anion exchange capacity of hydrous oxides of al structural sites wan et al 2017 could show that calcium ions released from zeolites lead to phosphorus precipitation in sludge reject water with the latter explanation also fitting better to the data for urine 5 3 targeted k recovery a few authors suggest recovering phosphorus as mpp instead of map for thermodynamic reasons previous nhtot removal is necessary to prevent the more favorable process of map precipitation e g by stripping gao et al 2018a huang et al 2019 or nitrification denitrification wilsenach et al 2007 both processes would lead to a substantial ph decrease which is unfavorable for the process using mgo as magnesium source leads to a suitable ph value table 9 and sufficient depletion of nitrogen by stripping section 5 1 1 would necessitate the addition of a base in the first place huang et al 2019 xu et al 2015 due to local difficulties of securing k fertilizer xu et al 2017 and xu et al 2011 attempted to optimize the process for k recovery by the addition of surplus p but despite adopting a high mg p ratio concomitant high removal rates of k and p were not achieved 6 nutrient removal only nitrogen already maurer et al 2006 suggested biological denitrification as well as electrochemical processes for nitrogen removal at the time only autotrophic denitrification had been tested in one successful short term experiment treating urine with sludge from a running anammox process 6 1 biological denitrification quantitative biological denitrification requires previous complete nitrification or nitritation we discussed complete nitrification in section 3 1 2 but will discuss partial and complete nitritation in this section before we proceed to the actual denitrification processes for a general short background on nitrification and inhibition we refer to section 3 1 6 1 1 partial and complete nitritation already maurer et al 2006 reported that due to inhibition of nitrite oxidizers early attempts to obtain partial nitrification in reactors with suspended solids only resulted in partial nitritation sun et al 2012 observed the same effect for a sequencing batch reactor sbr and an mbr not only for partial but also in the case of complete nitrification where others have achieved successful nitrification with suspended biomass operational conditions i e temperature ph and urine dilution were similar to the ones reported in table 2 for successful nitrification in a similar experiment on complete nitrification mackey et al 2016 achieved complete nitritation in a granular sludge sbr reactor by dosing sodium bicarbonate the authors hypothesize that the higher ph value up to 9 as compared to earlier nitrification experiments in a similar system at ph 7 3 7 6 by jiang et al 2011 lead to a stronger inhibition of nob than of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob resulting in nitrite accumulation pulse feeding was important for sustaining the granules and at an inlet nhtot concentration of 1500 gn m 3 nitritation rates of up to 1100 gn m 3 d 1 were obtained 6 1 2 heterotrophic denitrification of a nitrate or nitrite solution for urine heterotrophic denitrification of a nitrate or nitrite solution has been suggested the minimum cod n ratio for complete denitrification via nitrate and nitrite is 2 86 gcod gn 1 and 1 71 gcod gn 1 respectively not taking into account the cod demand for microbial growth udert and jenni 2013 the cod n ratio of around 1 in urine table 1 is consequently too low to support complete heterotrophic denitrification for this reason the process has mainly been suggested for nitrogen removal in sewers with ample provision of cod and for hydrogen sulfide control in pressure sewers in the latter case nitrate and nitrite can replace sulfate as electron acceptor thereby preventing biogenic sulfide corrosion jiang et al 2011 oosterhuis and van loosdrecht 2009 not surprisingly jiang et al 2011 could show that heterotrophic denitrification can be obtained through the addition of nitrified urine to raw wastewater the use of nitrite as electron acceptor may in some cases be attractive because it requires less cod for denitrification and its toxicity inhibits the growth of sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogens additionally increasing the chances of total nitrogen removal through denitrification in sewers mackey et al 2016 however whereas denitrification via nitrate is a well studied process from conventional wastewater treatment the same process via nitrite can lead to substantial production of volatile nitrogen oxides including climate relevant n2o schreiber et al 2012 we have found no explicit studies on this potential detrimental effect of nitrite reduction in sewer systems but we note that due to the fish toxicity of nitrite the process would only be relevant in systems without combined sewer overflows 6 1 3 nitritation anammox single and two stage process based on stoichiometry nitritation anammox would have a large potential for nitrogen removal from urine without additional cod udert et al 2008 however schielke jenni et al 2015 showed that in a single stage process nitritation anammox and heterotrophic denitrification will coincide and their contribution to nitrogen removal cannot be differentiated with a reasonable amount of measurements studies by bürgmann et al 2011 and huang et al 2016 have shown that single stage nitritation anammox is possible for nhtot removal from diluted urine bürgmann et al 2011 reported nitrogen removal rates of more than 430 gn m 3 d 1 with an average nhtot concentration in the influent of 590 gn m 3 but for still unknown reasons the process requires exact process control in order to prevent irreversible regime shifts to a population with low anammox activity and long term operation was not achieved competition by heterotrophic bacteria alone cannot be the explanation in experiments with sludge filtrate augmented with cod jenni et al 2014 showed perfect coexistence of the anammox process and heterotrophic denitrification in concentrated solutions successful nitritation anammox for undiluted urine has not been reported so far schielke jenni 2015 suggests that salt effects or inhibition by specific organic compounds are the two most likely reasons for nitritation anammox treatment of urine being challenging as already reported by maurer et al 2006 and suggested by chen et al 2017 partial nitritation as discussed in section 6 1 1 could be suitable for a two stage nitritation anammox process however schielke jenni et al 2015 were unsuccessful in maintaining stable nitrogen removal in a two stage process consisting of a continuous flow stirred tank reactor cstr for nitritation and an sbr with suspended biomass for anammox the anammox activity broke down soon after the influent was switched from digester supernatant to urine despite the attractive idea of removing nitrogen through nitritation anammox in urine the complexity seems to be high 6 2 electrochemical nitrogen removal electrolysis has been used to remove nitrogen compounds i e urea in fresh urine and nhtot in stored urine in most of these studies indirect oxidation with chlorine or hydroxyl radicals was the main mechanism see section 3 3 but direct oxidation at the anode was also reported zöllig et al 2017 investigated the electrolysis of real stored urine in batch experiments with bdd and tdirof besides ammonia cod was also degraded on bdd ammonia oxidation was slow until all cod was degraded but increased ten times after cod was removed table 10 the preferential removal of cod on bdd was probably due to breakdown of large organic molecules into small compounds by hydroxyl radicals the small organic molecules were preferentially oxidized by chlorine on tdirof ammonia and cod were degraded concomitantly from the beginning at a high rate table 10 energy demand was higher for bdd table 10 but it must be taken into account that the experiment with tdirof was shorter and the energy intensive phase with low ammonia and cod concentrations was not observed in experiments using tdirof amstutz et al 2012 reported a substantially lower efficiency for nitrogen removal from synthetic stored urine than from synthetic fresh urine ammonia electrolysis was slowed down because carbonate oxidation to percarbonate prevented the formation of chlorine which is necessary for the indirect oxidation of ammonia a later study zöllig et al 2017 with the same type of electrodes on real stored urine however did not confirm these findings the authors argued that the ph value and the carbonate concentration in real stored urine were too low to cause substantial competition by percarbonate formation in most studies on nitrogen removal with electrolysis residual nitrate was formed for example zöllig et al 2017 reported that 35 of the initial ammonia in real stored urine was converted to nitrate on bdd amstutz et al 2012 found that 24 of the initial urea and ammonia in synthetic fresh urine was converted to nitrate on tdirof shen et al 2019 developed a system for complete nitrogen removal batch experiments with real fresh urine in an ec with a photoanode and a selectively reductive pd au n f palladium gold nickel foam cathode resulted in total nitrogen and toc removal efficiencies of 99 and 55 respectively the two main challenges of electrolytic treatment of urine at high current densities are the high energy demand table 10 and the production of harmful cbps section 3 3 both effects are connected to the production of chlorine direct ammonia oxidation without mediation by chlorine was reported by amstutz et al 2012 for urea removal in fresh synthetic urine and by zöllig et al 2015a for ammonia removal in real stored urine zöllig et al 2015a showed that ammonia can be removed on cheap graphite when the anode potential is kept between 1 1 and 1 6 v versus a standard hydrogen electrode she in batch experiments at 1 31 v vs she an ammonia removal rate of 2 9 gn m 2 d 1 and an energy demand of 42 kwh kgn 1 was achieved table 10 the degradation rates were substantially lower than for indirect oxidation but in the same range as for denitrifying biofilm systems see table 10 it must be noted that direct ammonia oxidation can be limited by a local ph decrease at the anode because free ammonia but not ammonium reacts at the anode zöllig et al 2015b one alternative to energy consuming electrolysis could be urea degradation in fuel cells fc table 10 see also section 7 the degradation rate is close to the values for indirect electrolysis and is substantially higher than for direct electrolysis or biological denitrification furthermore in the electrochemical process of an fc energy is produced and not consumed however only few studies exist about fc treatment of urine and little to nothing is known about possible operational challenges if fc are operated on a long term 7 energy recovery energy recovery from urine was not reported by maurer et al 2006 since then fc and most notably mfc have been investigated for the direct production of electricity from urine in fc applications urea from fresh urine is oxidized at the anode while in mfc the electron donors are organic substances with a chemical oxygen demand i e substances which contain reduced carbon mfc can be fed with fresh or stored urine the maximum power production in fc and mfc is below 1 w p 1 table 11 and therefore too low to substantially contribute to the electricity demand of an industrialized country for comparison the average electric power consumption in switzerland was 760 w p 1 in 2019 bfe 2020 also the achievable power densities per anode surface are low lan and tao 2011 reported a maximum of 11 w m 2 for fc at 20 c with fresh urine while barbosa et al 2017 reported 0 95 w m 2 for mfc with stored urine these values were measured in short term polarization experiments in long term mfc experiments the power densities are even lower with reported power densities of 250 mw m 2 kuntke et al 2012 311 mw m 2 zhou et al 2015 and 314 mw m 2 barbosa et al 2017 for fc no continuous long term experiments have been reported all reported power densities for fc and mfc are substantially lower than the power densities which can be achieved in hydrogen fc xu et al 2016a cited values of 5000 to 6000 w m 2 for proton exchange membrane fc operated with hydrogen the amount of energy which can be recovered from a substrate depends on the extent of substrate degradation and on the coulombic efficiency a typical coulombic efficiency for mfc is around 25 see e g barbosa et al 2017 but values vary widely ieropoulos et al 2012 reported values between 22 and 70 and santoro et al 2014 reported only 2 1 with urine while the cod removal efficiency was 85 possible reasons for low coulombic efficiencies are the competition with other cod consuming processes such as sulfate reduction santoro et al 2013 methanogenesis barbosa et al 2017 or the consumption of oxygen which diffuses from the cathode into the anode chamber liu et al 2004 in contrast to mfc coulombic efficiencies in fc can be very high xu et al 2016b reported a coulombic efficiency of 98 when using a cr vi solution as catholyte however we did not find any other values for the coulombic efficiency in urine fc in addition to the low power production the material costs are an additional challenge for electricity production material costs can be particularly high for anodes used in fc to reduce costs lan et al 2010 studied the use of nickel instead of platinum as anode material lan and tao 2011 and xu et al 2014 aimed at increasing the performance of nickel anodes by using nano sized nickel or nickel alloys with cobalt respectively while anodes of mfc usually consist of cheap graphite the focus of reducing material costs for mfc has been mainly on cem instead of engineered cem ceramic membranes pasternak et al 2016 natural rubber gloves winfield et al 2014 and different types of paper winfield et al 2015 were tested however the most promising setups are single chamber mfc with membrane less air cathodes e g santorio et al 2013 since urine based fc and mfc cannot contribute substantially to the overall electricity consumption of a society researchers explored special applications e g small or mobile devices such as mobile phone chargers ieropoulos et al 2013b heartbeat actuators walters et al 2013 emergency location transmitters winfield et al 2015 or wireless transmitters taghavi et al 2015 in practical applications stacks of small mfc are used to increase power densities and to prevent cell polarity reversal ieropoulos et al 2013a additionally the stacks are arranged in series see e g ieropoulos et al 2013b to increase the low voltage of single mfc see table 11 while electricity production from urine with mfc and fc is probably only interesting for some niche applications these systems could provide fast and energy efficient cod or nitrogen removal respectively see sections 3 3 and 6 2 in some studies on electrochemical urine treatment energy rich hydrogen is produced at the cathode kim et al 2013 and luther et al 2015 calculated energy savings of 10 and 36 if hydrogen was used to recover electricity in a fuel cell christiaens et al 2017 produced protein with the help of hydrogen oxidizing bacteria a totally different approach of energy recovery was used by mercer et al 2019 the authors showed that after water removal by md part of the thermal energy could be recovered as electrical energy with reverse ed the authors suggest that such a system could be used to convert waste heat used for md to electricity in order to support the electricity requirements of off grid sanitation systems in low income countries 8 removal of pathogens and organic micropollutants 8 1 removal of pathogens although urine is normally free of pathogens as long as it is contained in the human bladder fecal contamination often occurs during urine collection in urine diverting toilets or urinals consequently storage to obtain sufficient sanitization for direct use of urine as fertilizer was one of the first processes reported for source separated urine maurer et al 2006 in view of the importance surprisingly little effort has been invested in the methods for sanitization since then except for one unsuccessful example of ultraviolet radiation uv inactivation of pathogens in urine giannakis et al 2018 pathogen inactivation or separation from the nutrients has mainly been reported or can be assumed as a side effect of a main urine treatment process distillation at temperatures beyond 55 c lead to heat inactivation and during nitrogen stripping we expect the non volatile pathogens to remain in the solution for alkaline drying senecal et al 2018 investigated the fate of pathogens after dehydration of urine in wood ash all bacteria and phages were removed to below the detection limit within four days of storage at 20 c but the nematode ascaris suum required substantial time in order to obtain a log 3 reduction 325 days at 20 c and 9 2 days at 42 c however the expected concentration of nematodes in the resulting fertilizer product would already be below the who guidelines for unrestricted use due to the limited fecal contamination of urine in many other cases we must expect drying combined with short heat treatments to be the most obvious method of sanitization this would only be counter indicated in the case of struvite which decomposes at temperatures above 55 c bhuiyan et al 2008 giving rise to ammonia losses decrey et al 2011 and bischel et al 2016 investigated the inactivation of virus phages helminth eggs ascaris suum heterotrophic and total bacteria as well as enterococcus spp and salmonella typhimurium during drying of struvite all at 5 35 c and at a relative humidity of 40 80 higher temperatures and decreased moisture increased deactivation but it was concluded that a short heat treatment above 55 c before drying would be required for the struvite product from urine to be safe for use in agriculture bischel et al 2015b investigated the fate of viral and bacterial pathogen surrogates during urine nitrification they found that some inactivation occurred but they concluded that nitrification was insufficient as a stand alone technology for sanitization of source separated urine 8 2 removal of organic micropollutants from conventional wwtps it is known that while biological treatment alone will not lead to sufficient removal activated carbon is effective for unspecific removal of organic micropollutants from treated wastewater albeit with strong competition from dissolved organic matter benstoem et al 2017 for urine it may thus be most economic to use the method after biological treatment see section 3 1 but up to 2019 we have found no scientific articles on this topic in practice however the effective removal of organic micropollutants from biologically treated urine by activated carbon has led to the licensing of the urine based fertilizer aurin for all crops in switzerland www vuna ch ozonation is another well established process for unspecific removal of micropollutants in wastewater again in strong competition with the oxidation of organic matter bourgin et al 2018 the process functions for urine too but with a much higher energy demand than for wastewater treatment and a high production of toxic by products dodd et al 2008 fitzke and geißen 2007 gajurel et al 2007 gulyas et al 2007 tettenborn et al 2007 there has been no follow up publications on the topic since 2008 for urine there are two different main goals when dealing with organic micropollutants separation from nutrients and removal with a focus on fertilizer production one may consider the separation of nutrients and organic micropollutants sufficient this effect has mainly been shown for precipitation of struvite where ronteltap et al 2007a and wei et al 2018 observed consistent low inclusion with 95 99 of the spiked organic micropollutants remaining in the liquid other authors reported inclusion only before washing de boer et al 2018 or without indicating any washing of the struvite crystals schürmann et al 2012 in fresh urine nano filtration nf has been tested for separation of nutrients from micropollutants lazarova and spendlingwimmer 2008 report close to 90 retention of the micropollutants but only 40 permeation of urea this is in contrast to previous results on nf where pronk et al 2006b found excellent permeation of urea in addition cristóvão et al 2019 studied the separation of anticancer drugs from synthetic fresh urine by nf with more than 89 rejection by the best nf material albeit with close to 20 co rejection of urea and monovalent ions and 32 99 for multivalent ions with a focus on water pollution control there is a large opportunity for removal of organic micropollutants from urine and not only for separation see section 1 for a discussion for urine with low cod content activated carbon has already proven highly effective in practice for urine with a high content of cod however there is a considerable research gap with only little information available whereas many authors have performed experiments on advanced oxidation processes aops and adsorption with the purpose of removing one or several pharmaceuticals the majority conducted the experiments with synthetic urine containing no or little cod we therefore only give a short summary of the literature on these processes in order to show where some process information is available as a basis to conduct further experiments with real urine containing realistic amounts of cod we note that after 2019 there has been a long required boost of publications on the removal of organic micropollutants which we unfortunately did not catch in this review 8 2 1 advanced oxidation processes aops low pressure uv alone or in combination with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 peroxydisulfate pds and h2o2 fenton has been tested on different drugs in synthetic urine with the combinations with pds and h2o2 fenton reaching the best results giannakis et al 2017a giannakis et al 2017b giannakis et al 2017c zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a zhang et al 2016b further luo et al 2019 tested ferrate feo4 2 and wang et al 2019 biochar activated monochloramine for the oxidation of selected pharmaceuticals both with good results in the selected settings 8 2 2 adsorption processes for removal of organic micropollutants adsorption has not only been suggested for removal of organic micropollutants but also for targeted recovery of nutrients sections 5 1 2 and 5 2 2 only few authors however have questioned whether co adsorption of nutrients and organic micropollutants would play a role tarpeh et al 2017 for instance proposed post treatment for removal of organic micropollutants after nutrient adsorption only sendrowski and boyer 2013 tested co adsorption experimentally and in fact found high co removal of the pharmaceutical diclofenac in an anion exchange process for p recovery a number of authors have studied the adsorption of specific pharmaceuticals on adsorbents of different origin mostly biochars paredes laverde et al 2019 paredes laverde et al 2018 solanki and boyer 2017 sun et al 2018 and strong base anion exchange resin landry and boyer 2013 landry et al 2015 the authors mostly found no significant differences between fresh and stored synthetic urine only few of the authors addressed the two major concerns for adsorption of organic micropollutants competition from dissolved organic matter and possible co adsorption of nutrients solanki and boyer 2019 found significant lower adsorption on biochar for real than for synthetic urine but again with no differences between fresh and stored urine based on batch experiments the authors suggest to use the double amount of biochar than for synthetic urine i e 40 gbiochar l 1 corresponding to 60 gbiochar p 1 d 1 as seen in section 5 1 2 biochar is used for targeted nitrogen removal in fresh and stored urine at high ph values leading to excellent results we would therefore expect substantial co adsorption of nitrogen in both types of urine in fact solanki and boyer 2017 observed exactly this with the problem being especially pronounced for activated carbon with 20 n removal and a little more surprisingly also 40 p removal while it was difficult to prove the actual removal mechanisms the authors argue that in both cases co adsorption would be a plausible explanation in municipal wastewater treatment however adsorption of ammonia or phosphate on activated carbon is commonly not observed 8 2 3 pharmaceutical removal in electrochemical processes in a few studies ecs were used to remove pharmaceuticals either by oxidation or reduction on the one hand indirect oxidation on bdd cotillas et al 2018 and ti iro2 anodes jojoa sierra et al 2017 was shown to be a suitable process for antibiotics removal pharmaceuticals and intermediates could be removed completely though degradation of organic compounds slowed down their oxidation on the other hand de gusseme et al 2011 investigated the reductive dehalogenation of the iodinated x ray contrast medium diatrizoate in an mec with a cathode containing biogenic palladium nanoparticles ed was tested on the removal of pharmaceuticals with membranes pronk et al 2007 reported that during a one year long pilot experiment with real stored urine diclofenac carbamazepine and propranol were removed below the detection limit while ibuprofen was removed to a large extent in addition estrogenic activity was reduced by 90 9 qualitative comparison of technologies the technology overview in table 12 shows that many technologies are well understood with respect to the recovery or removal of nutrients water and cod the main knowledge gaps exist for pathogen and micropollutant removal for some processes a certain performance during urine treatment can be assumed based on known properties of the technologies we presumed that membranes used for nanofiltration membrane distillation and cation and anion exchange provide a good removal of pathogens and pharmaceuticals based on studies by pronk et al 2006 for nanofiltration and pronk et al 2007 for ed from conventional wastewater treatment it is known that processes like ozonation and aop are well suited for pathogen removal during distillation urine is heated to approximately 80 c which is above the requirements for pasteurization for all biological processes we presumed no substantial effect on pathogen removal based on the study by bischel et al 2015 for urine nitrification a quantitative assessment of the suitability of the technologies was not the goal of this paper however this review can serve as a first step towards such an assessment which should also include the resource demand of the different technologies besides energy and chemical consumables the resource demand should also include installation and maintenance costs for reactors as well as space requirements however for most technologies much of this information is not available yet or not reliable due to the low technology readiness level 10 conclusions our review for the years 2006 2019 has shown that the research community has made tremendous progress in the development of urine treatment technologies no industrialized urine treatment reactors exist to date for any of the processes but many technologies are close to industrial optimization based on our review we see the following trends for the further development for urine treatment technologies urine treatment should be as close as possible to the source to prevent transport costs most technologies were therefore developed for reactors at bathroom scale or at the scale of larger building or building complexes physical chemical processes especially alkaline stabilization combined with evaporation adsorption or membrane separation processes seem to be particular suitable at bath room scale challenges are the requirements for reagents energy and maintenance such as membrane cleansing biological processes are arguably the most efficient technologies for urine stabilization but due to possible inhibition effects by salt or free ammonia they are more robust at larger scale efficient processes for water removal such as distillation or for nutrient recovery such as ammonia stripping and phosphate precipitation are also better suited for large scale application due to their technical complexity a growing new field of technologies involve electrochemical processes they provide new possibilities such as electricity generation or on site disinfection but challenges such as low efficiencies and high process complexities still need to be overcome most technologies developed so far focus on nutrient recovery or removal more development is needed for the removal of pathogens and micropollutants however it should be noted that since 2019 important improvements have been made which were not included in this review another topic to be investigated in more detail is the treatment or disposal of side streams especially in the case of single nutrient recovery processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests kai m udert is co owner of the eawag spin off vuna ltd the company uses biological and physical processes for nutrient recovery from urine the study was not influenced by the relationship of kai m udert with vuna ltd 
19935,over the last 15 years urine treatment technologies have developed from lab studies of a few pioneers to an interesting innovation attracting attention from a growing number of process engineers in this broad review we present literature from more than a decade on biological physical chemical and electrochemical urine treatment processes like in the first review on urine treatment from 2006 we categorize the technologies according to the following objectives stabilization volume reduction targeted n recovery targeted p recovery nutrient removal sanitization and handling of organic micropollutants we add energy recovery as a new objective because extensive work has been done on electrochemical energy harvesting especially with bio electrochemical systems our review reveals that biological processes are a good choice for urine stabilization they have the advantage of little demand for chemicals and energy due to instabilities however they are not suited for bathroom applications and they cannot provide the desired volume reduction on their own a number of physical chemical treatment technologies are applicable at bathroom scale and can provide the necessary volume reduction but only with a steady supply of chemicals and often with high demand for energy and maintenance electrochemical processes is a recent but rapidly growing field which could give rise to exciting technologies at bathroom scale although energy production might only be interesting for niche applications the review includes a qualitative assessment of all unit processes a quantitative comparison of treatment performance was not the goal of the study and could anyway only be done for complete treatment trains an important next step in urine technology research and development will be the combination of unit processes to set up and test robust treatment trains we hope that the present review will help guide these efforts to accelerate the development towards a mature technology

radiation wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction the community of wastewater professionals has worked on the concept of urine source separation since the mid 1990 ties with the double purpose of water pollution control and recycling of nutrients mainly for agriculture in an early critical review of potential urine treatment technologies maurer et al 2006 defined seven process engineering objectives to reach the double purpose of water pollution control and reuse of nutrients in agriculture stabilization volume reduction targeted n recovery targeted p recovery nutrient removal sanitization and handling of organic micropollutants in the present review we take up this structure adding the goal of energy recovery the rationale of urine source separation for improved water pollution control is based on the fact that urine provides most of the nitrogen and phosphorus contained in household wastewater larsen and gujer 1996 the large emissions of nitrogen and phosphorus are considered some of the most critical global environmental challenges with a high risk of destabilizing the earth s ecosystem mainly due to eutrophication in fresh water ecosystems and coastal areas steffen et al 2015 separate collection and treatment of urine combined with small compact wastewater treatment plants wwtps for the remaining wastewater removes nutrients as efficiently as the most advanced wwtps for mixed wastewater known today wilsenach and van loosdrecht 2006 at a global scale this is important because only around 10 of the world s population has access to nutrient eliminating wwtps larsen 2011 further about two thirds of the pharmaceuticals excreted by the human metabolism and about half of the corresponding eco toxicological potential of those pharmaceuticals are contained in urine lienert et al 2007a lienert et al 2007b with increasing concern about organic micropollutants in aquatic ecosystems eggen et al 2014 there would be benefits from removing pharmaceuticals from the aquatic ecosystems through urine separation nutrient recovery from urine can simplify the recycling of nutrients from the human metabolism to agriculture in the case of phosphorus food security as well as the environment would strongly benefit from recycling strategies because of the increasing economic and environmental costs of phosphorus mining cordell and neset 2014 in the case of nitrogen a freely available resource from the atmosphere there are three main arguments for recycling from urine energy demand economic value and reducing the emissions of hazardous nitrogen compounds to the environment removal of nitrogen from wastewater and production of nitrogen fertilizer are both energy intensive processes maurer et al 2003 dependent upon technologies recycling of nitrogen from urine can be more energy efficient than removal from wastewater and subsequent industrial fertilizer production economically nitrogen is by far the most valuable nutrient in urine etter et al 2011 where fertilizers are expensive or even unavailable for farmers especially in low income countries urine may be a cost effective substitute andersson et al 2013 many recycling technologies provide additional nutrients like phosphorus potassium and sulfur with high importance for the quality of the crops jönsson and vinneras 2013 on wwtps nitrous oxide emissions have recently proven much more important than expected often surpassing the climate effect of co2 emissions from electricity demand at the plants gruber et al 2020 as pointed out by steffen et al 2015 curbing the production of reactive nitrogen and the associated production of climate gases during the entire lifetime of the compound is one of the most important goals of the 21st century with a global excretion of around 30 mt yr 1 of nitrogen in urine roughly 10 g p 1 d 1 a recycling strategy could contribute significantly to reducing the requirements for industrially produced reactive nitrogen which is at present around 120 mt yr 1 razon 2018 the quality of a recycled product from urine must align with the requirements of the customers in most cases farmers besides fertilizer value hygiene and stability are therefore important factors defining quality although the removal of organic micropollutants is disputed based on the comparison with animal manure which equally contains organic micropollutants hammer and clemens 2007 at least in switzerland it is required for urine based fertilizers intended for edible crops www vuna ch aurin since the first overview article on urine treatment technologies was published by maurer et al 2006 more targeted review articles have been published however none of them provides a structured overview of the available technologies to reach the treatment goals of urine source separation a number of reviews have occurred with a focus on implementation in low income countries rahman et al 2015 simha and ganesapillai 2017 and more specific reviews have been published on selected technologies for urine treatment kabdaşlı and tünay 2018 focus on struvite precipitation ion exchange and adsorption patel et al 2020 give a detailed overview of membrane and electrochemical technologies and finally chipako and randall 2020 present technologies optimizing nutrient recovery with a focus on the ph dependence of these technologies for more in depth discussions than we are able to provide in this comprehensive review we refer to these specific reviews in a recent paper larsen et al 2021 discuss the requirements for global diffusion of the radical innovation of urine source separation the two most important technical elements defined are 1 mass produced urine separating toilets adapted to the socio economic environment and 2 mass produced treatment technology while a new toilet technology for high income countries entered the market already and several versions are in development for low income countries this present review discusses the state of the art of treatment technology development for the complex socio economic aspects of global diffusion we refer to larsen et al 2021 2 composition of fresh and stored urine there is a huge difference between the properties of fresh and stored urine whereas fresh urine contains a high concentration of urea this compound is rapidly hydrolyzed to ammonia and carbon dioxide as soon as urine enters the non sterile environment leading to the release of ammonia and bicarbonate and causing a ph increase udert et al 2006 equation 1 h 2 n c o n h 2 2 h 2 o n h 3 n h 4 h c o 3 the most relevant compounds in urine are nutrients and organic micropollutants with concentrations in fresh urine mainly depending on diet and medication respectively the concentration of heavy metals is so low that it is not an issue ronteltap et al 2007a but due to cross contamination from faeces source separated urine can contain pathogens bischel et al 2015a höglund et al 1998 the ph increase observed in stored urine leads to precipitation processes altering the concentration of a number of ions most importantly a substantial decrease in phosphorus concentration of around 30 and a nearly complete removal of calcium and magnesium ions udert et al 2003 these precipitation processes depend on the composition of fresh urine but also on the amount and composition of co separated flush water especially the calcium and magnesium content during urine collection and storage in ventilated rising pipes and tanks volatilization of ammonia can lead to substantial nitrogen loss siegrist et al 2013 in table 1 we list values for ph electrical conductivity and concentrations in undiluted fresh and stored urine please note that in practice source separated urine is often diluted with some flushing water on average the production of urine is 1 4 l p 1 d 1 dwa 2016 3 stabilization of urine following maurer et al 2006 urine stabilization includes processes which i degrade organic matter thus preventing malodor ii prevent volatilization of nh3 and iii prevent unwanted precipitation which can result in operational problems such as pipe clogging or membrane fouling 3 1 biological processes for stabilization biological stabilization primarily aims at reducing the ph value of urine through nitrification and fulfills the goal of removing most of the organic matter including malodorous compounds udert and wächter 2012 a biological process with its high enzymatic activity will rapidly convert any remaining urea to ammonium coppens et al 2016 and it thus makes no difference whether the substrate is fresh or stored urine however the nitrifying community will differ because not all nitrifying bacteria produce urease de paepe et al 2018 partial nitrification is the most frequent biological stabilization method but a number of authors used complete nitrification for the provision of a stabilized substrate for algae growth coppens et al 2016 feng et al 2008 section 4 4 or for the provision of a stabilized substrate for volume reduction by electrodialysis ed de paepe et al 2018 section 4 3 although ammonium and nitrite oxidation are normally unproblematic in conventional wastewater treatment high concentrations of salt moussa et al 2006 free ammonia and nitrous acid anthonisen et al 1976 may limit the reaction rates in concentrated urine solutions and can lead to an imbalance between ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob udert and wächter 2012 3 1 1 partial nitrification of urine biological production of ammonium nitrate based on the alkalinity in urine only mainly originating from urea hydrolysis equation 1 nitrification results in approximately equal amounts of total ammonia nhtot and nitrate udert and wächter 2012 during ammonia oxidation ph decreases to a value of around 5 4 at which the activity of nitrosomonas eutropha the dominant aob in the process ceases due to energy limitations fumasoli et al 2015 keeping ph in a narrow range e g by controlling the inflow rate of urine udert and wächter 2012 is the key to stable nitrate production otherwise partial nitrification may result in ammonium nitrite section 6 1 1 according to the literature until 2019 stable partial nitrification has only been achieved in biofilm reactors table 2 but at similar nitrification rates per surface as in municipal wastewater systems sørensen and morgenroth 2020 cite values between 0 5 and 2 5 gn m 2 d 1 in the early works on urine nitrification emphasis was not on optimization but on feasibility feng et al 2008 and stability of the process udert and wächter 2012 with the latter process running stable for 12 months in a long running pilot plant fumasoli et al 2016 found that the nitrification rate was inversely correlated with the inlet nhtot concentration table 2 showing that the inhibition by salt and or free ammonia is in fact relevant for urine nitrification based on typical daily nitrogen excretions in urine table 1 this results in a reactor size of around 50 l p 1 for the highly concentrated urine and around 10 l p 1 for the more diluted urine with a trade off between reactor size for partial nitrification and energy demand of subsequent evaporation processes section 4 1 the major challenge for the stability of partial nitrification is inhibition of nob by nitrous acid caused by accumulation of nitrite fumasoli et al 2016 another challenge is the growth of acid tolerant aob when urine nitrification is operated at low ph values if acid tolerant aob are allowed to grow in they may cause a ph decrease to values as low as 2 2 resulting in emission of large amounts of hazardous volatile nitrogen compounds such as no n2o no2 and hno2 with detrimental effects on air quality and climate and a loss of acid sensitive nitrifiers fumasoli et al 2017 while it is easy to keep ph within narrow bands there is a lack of methods to monitor and control the nitrite concentration mašić et al 2015 an additional research gap exists with respect to the emission of nitrous oxides during normal operation a problem that has gained increased importance for conventional wastewater treatment gruber et al 2020 3 1 2 complete nitrification of urine biological production of nitrate complete nitrification i e oxidation of all ammonia to nitrate is only possible by providing additional alkalinity this has been proven in biofilm systems as well as in reactors with suspended biomass at a ph between 6 5 and 8 table 2 like in the case of partial nitrification section 3 1 1 we observe higher nitrification rates at higher dilution of urine coppens et al 2016 showed the importance of a halotolerant inoculum which halved the start up time as compared to an inoculum from a wwtp unfortunately this did not lead to a higher final reaction rate indicating that long term adaptation to high salt concentrations is difficult especially for the ammonia oxidizers identified by the authors as less tolerant to high salt concentrations than the nitrite oxidizers the observed inhibition by salt is supported by the comparable low process rates found by mackey et al 2014 who diluted urine with seawater instead of tap water as done in comparable experiments jiang et al 2011 for many practical purposes of complete nitrification especially heterotrophic denitrification in sewers dilution with tap water is unproblematic and the optimal dilution is therefore of less importance than for partial nitrification where volume reduction is most often intended see section 3 1 1 for a discussion of the trade offs between dilution and volume reduction in fact using a larger water volume for urine flushing will easily achieve sufficient dilution of ammonia and salt except in places like hong kong where toilets are flushed with seawater for practical implementation especially in on site settings dosing of alkalinity is the main challenge oosterhuis and van loosdrecht 2009 3 2 chemical processes for stabilization chemical stabilization of urea inhibits the enzyme responsible for its degradation and prevents a ph increase in the first place equation 1 ray et al 2018 found that fluoride ionic zinc and ionic silver were ineffective whereas acid proved effective as already discussed by maurer et al 2006 the technologies of alkaline section 3 2 2 and electrochemical stabilization section 3 3 have only emerged after 2006 little new literature is available on neutralization of stored urine with acid section 3 2 1 and filtration and precipitation to prevent fouling of synthetic membranes included in section 4 2 3 2 1 acid dosage while antonini et al 2012 found neutralization of stored urine with strong acid effective but too dangerous to implement in a simple setting in vietnam jiang et al 2017 established a quantitative relationship between ph value and ammonia loss for a distillation process on acidified stored urine with 99 5 n recovery at ph 4 and less than 50 at ph 7 as already discussed in maurer et al 2006 however neutralization of stored urine requires large amounts of acid due to the high alkalinity of urine after urea hydrolysis table 1 for the more economic urea stabilization in fresh urine ray et al 2018 found that weak acids like acetic acid citric acid and vinegar could be used for the inhibition of urea hydrolysis in the concentration range of 32 130 meq l 1 for short term inhibition of urea hydrolysis in a building urine collecting system saetta et al 2019 used predictive modeling combined with real time conductivity and ph data for dosing acetic acid in order to keep a low ph around 4 low urination volumes and frequencies led to the highest degree of hydrolysis i e the highest demand for acetic acid whereas high urination volumes and frequency led to less mixing and less time for hydrolysis in the pipes in the international space station iss sulfuric acid has been used for stabilization in combination with 0 56 chromium trioxide but even these harsh conditions could not totally prevent fungal growth which was the primary cause for biofouling and damaged hardware observed in the urine processing assembly birmele et al 2009a birmele et al 2009b 3 2 2 base dosage alkaline stabilization of urea is the alternative to acidic stabilization randall et al 2016 compared three chemicals for reaching a ph above 11 necessary for urease inhibition in urine calcium oxide calcium carbonate and slaked lime of those chemicals slaked lime i e ca oh 2 proved to be the only suitable one with the additional advantage of low cost and low solubility allowing the right amount to dissolve from a large amount added to a urine container randall et al 2016 an additional advantage of this stabilization process is that it leads to immediate p precipitation which may result in the production of a separate p fertilizer section 5 2 1 an alternative to direct alkaline stabilization in liquid urine is the same process in a dry bed dutta and vinneras 2016 showed that a mixture of ca oh 2 and wood ash 1 1 would keep the ph value of fresh urine above 10 which in this solid mixture was deemed enough to retain urea although some ammonia losses occurred senecal and vinneras 2017 even reached ph values higher than 10 with wood ash alone simha et al 2018a showed that the concept of an anion exchanger resin could potentially work exchanging oh ions against cl ions for providing additional base to fresh urine prior to these processes but up to 2019 we have seen no follow up projects an aspect of high significance for liquid and dry alkaline stabilization alike is the stability of the ph value once obtained senecal and vinneras 2017 observed that co2 adsorption from the air led to a critical ph decrease simha et al 2018a suggested that besides co2 absorption buffering of alkaline earth metals and nhtot formation from urea degradation lead to a ph decrease the most important research gap for alkaline stabilization is thus the setup of a system which effectively prevents co2 uptake from air thereby inducing a critical positive feedback mechanism due to increased urea hydrolysis in section 4 we will discuss the volume reduction of stabilized urine for fertilizer production an alternative usage for alkaline stabilized urine would be the production of bricks through mixing with sand and urease producing base tolerant bacteria henze and randall 2018 lambert and randall 2019 the carbonate produced through urea hydrolysis combines with calcium and the resulting calcium carbonate cements the sand particles together allowing for the production of a low cost building material with a compressive strength comparable to the strength of conventional bricks 3 3 electrochemical processes for stabilization electrochemical processes have been used to stabilize urine by removing organic substances preventing urea hydrolysis or inactivating microorganisms in this section we discuss mainly urine stabilization in electrolysis cells ec removal of organic substances has also been investigated to a large extent with microbial fuel cells mfc with the benefit of producing electricity see section 7 in most studies on urine electrolysis indirect oxidation with chlorine is the main mechanism for removal of organics and nitrogen compounds and sometimes nacl was even added to boost the oxidation process chun et al 2018 ikematsu et al 2006 chlorine is a potent oxidant which is produced by the oxidation of chloride besides chlorine hydroxyl radicals are important oxidants especially in the case of boron doped diamond electrodes bdd zöllig et al 2017 conducted batch experiments in the lab to investigate the electrolysis of real stored urine using either bdd or a titanium anode with a thermally decomposed iro2 film tdirof see also section 6 2 on nitrogen removal on both electrodes fast removal of organic substances started right from the beginning of the experiments actually at the start of the experiment cod removal was preferred over ammonia oxidation on bdd the cod degradation rates were 10 to 50 times higher than rates observed in biofilm systems or in mfc see table 3 however the energy demand is very high actually mfc might be an interesting alternative for cod removal the degradation rates are similar to the maximum rates observed in conventional biofilm systems and the electricity produced could be used for process monitoring while indirect oxidation with free chlorine can be a fast and efficient removal process for organics nitrogen compounds section 6 2 pharmaceuticals and pathogens section 8 the process can be problematic due to the formation of chlorinated by products cbps which can be hazardous for the environment and human health zöllig et al 2015c dbira et al 2015 and zöllig et al 2017 reported that chloride was nearly completely removed due to the formation of cbps zöllig et al 2015c examined the fate of the organic cbps dichloromethane trichloromethane tetrachloromethane 1 2 dichloroethane 1 2 dichloropropane and chlorobenzene and the inorganic cbps chlorate and perchlorate during electrolysis on bdd and tdirof perchlorate and chlorate were the dominant cbps consuming more than 90 of the initial chloride most of the organic cbps were stripped to the air thereby posing a health hazard 4 nutrient recovery by volume reduction volume reduction typically results in the recovery of several nutrients the technologies of interest rely on evaporation membrane processes including ed a combination of membrane technology and electrochemistry and the uptake of nutrients in algae 4 1 drying and distillation processes distillation and drying both rely on evaporation but whereas water in the distillation process is re condensed with the possibility to recover water and some of the high evaporation energy of around 700 wh l 1 udert and wächter 2012 this normally does not happen in a drying process evaporation essentially concentrates all non volatile compounds in urine with the large advantage of keeping also micronutrients in the fertilizer product harder et al 2019 but also with potential negative consequences if organic micropollutants are not removed along the process chain section 8 2 there is always a risk of some ammonia volatilization but depending on the effectivity of the preceding stabilization process section 3 and the process configuration this loss can be minimized drying has mainly been suggested for on site settings in the bathroom after on site alkaline stabilization the process can profit from high air temperatures but as shown by randall et al 2016 alkaline stabilized urea becomes chemically unstable at temperatures above 40 c dutta and vinneras 2016 and senecal and vinneras 2017 evaporated alkaline stabilized urine by applying a forced air stream to a drying bed based on wood ash senecal and vinneras 2017 obtained more than 80 nitrogen recovery at an evaporation temperature of 35 c resulting in a solid product with up to 7 8 n 2 5 p and 10 9 k by weight comparable to commercial npk fertilizers the corresponding high loss of ammonia to the atmosphere obviously calls for process improvements in a similar study simha et al 2018a established that higher temperatures led to higher evaporation rates but that a higher air flow rate was only beneficial within limits and a deeper bed was counterproductive due to the instability of urea at temperatures above 40 c there are clear limits for the improvement of rates based on temperature udert and wächter 2012 investigated water removal from partially nitrified urine section 3 1 1 by distillation in a small lab scale evaporator at 78 c and 200 mbar resulting in a dry product or a highly concentrated liquid product fumasoli et al 2016 describe the application of this process in a commercial distillation reactor with vapor compression and heat recovery resulting in a concentrated nutrient solution with concentrations w w of around 5 n 0 2 p and 2 k the energy demand of distillation was around 110 wh l 1 as compared to around 710 wh l 1 for the evaporation of water without energy recovery equally important is that the small loss of nitrogen is contained in the distillate and therefore not emitted to the atmosphere distillation of acid stabilized fresh urine is possible carter et al 2013 as is distillation of fresh urine without stabilization lefebvre et al 2015 but in the latter case obviously only for a short time until urea hydrolysis becomes substantial we have found no attempts to use distillation for urine stabilized at a high ph value though high ammonia losses are to be expected due to chemical urea hydrolysis at high temperatures and high ph values randall et al 2016 the advantage of drying is the applicability at bathroom scale but there are still important research gaps with respect to energy recovery and reduction of ammonia losses the obvious advantages of distillation is energy recovery and the capture of ammonia in the distillate where it will not lead to air contamination distillation is a well established commercial process but if it is to be downscaled more explorative processes like membrane distillation md section 4 2 2 could be more promising 4 2 membrane processes the membrane processes applied for volume reduction are primarily forward osmosis fo and ed for the latter we refer to section 4 3 further md is an explorative alternative technology to conventional distillation section 4 1 ultrafiltration has proven an effective pre treatment step prior to the osmotic membrane processes intended for volume reduction removing up to 99 of the suspended solids in stored urine but with severe fouling problems of the membrane ouma et al 2016 for all membrane processes there are important differences between the treatment of fresh urine with nitrogen mainly contained in urea an uncharged molecule and the treatment of stored urine where nitrogen is mainly contained in the acid base pair nh4 nh3 all membrane applications suffer from fouling leading in many cases to short duration of the experiments this will be a major hurdle for on site applications of membrane treatment where regular cleaning of the membranes is difficult 4 2 1 forward osmosis fo with the technology of fo the rejection of nitrogen compounds volpin et al 2019 and the water flux liu et al 2016 increase with increasing concentration of the draw solution from table 4 summarizing the available results on the process we observe that high retention of all three main nutrients n p and k is possible as well as a high volume reduction of up to 85 however all authors applied the process only to synthetic urine and none obtained good results on all parameters those who used fresh urine report ph values of 6 7 where urea is not stable section 3 2 for stored urine we only observe good ammonia retention at a low ph values at which the concentration of nh3 is low requiring large amounts of acid for neutralization maurer et al 2006 all authors identified fouling as a major problem zhang et al 2014 reduced the problem by removal of precipitates prior to membrane treatment but only for an experimental duration of 70 hours 4 2 2 membrane distillation md in the md process the driving force is the vapor pressure difference produced by the temperature difference across a hydrophobic membrane only allowing volatile compounds to pass derese and verliefde 2016 from urine we would thus expect water vapor nh3 and volatile organic compounds to pass the membrane making the process suitable only for stabilized urine where the concentration of free ammonia is low as we will see however some new membrane developments may challenge this conventional wisdom the energy demand for md is slightly higher than for vapor compression distillation with heat recovery for example winter et al 2011 reported energy demands of 180 to 240 kwh m 3 for treating water with a salinity of 35 g kg 1 in spiral wound md modules while fumasoli et al 2016 reported 107 kwh m 3 for treating partially nitrified urine with vapor compression distillation and heat recovery the advantage of md over conventional vapor compression distillation could be the simpler setup and the possibility to use low grade heat instead of electricity derese and verliefde 2016 there is little experience with md of stabilized fresh urine ray et al 2019 came close by testing dcmd on a urea solution previously obtained from urine through an fo process the fo process resulted in incomplete selective mass transfer of urea but with some co transfer of cod in the md process on the urea solution urea recovery ranged from 72 92 and different stabilization methods had no effects on recovery despite the reduced cod content severe fouling of the membrane occurred strongly questioning the viability of md on fresh urine for stored urine tun et al 2016 showed that the permeation of nitrogen through the membrane is proportional to the concentration of free ammonia in the feed solution and negligible at ph 6 following chemical acidification the authors applied filtration to prevent fouling but with little effect xu et al 2019a suggested partial or full nitrification for stabilization which would have the additional advantage of removing a large portion of the cod with an unusual high ph of 8 3 after partial nitrification see section 3 1 1 only complete nitrification section 3 1 2 resulted in a high nitrogen retention of 94 but the experiments were too short to verify the anti fouling effects of biological treatment in general a major research gap for fo is the lack of long term experience especially with respect to fouling additionally like for the fo processes only stored urine with a low ph is suitable as feed requiring large amounts of acid for neutralization maurer et al 2006 in an alternative approach to deal with the poor rejection of ammonia by dcmd at high ph khumalo et al 2019 changed the membrane properties with nanoparticles creating smaller evenly distributed pores and a porous spongy structure in experiments on real stored urine without ph adjustment with a temperature difference of 30 c and using the most hydrophobic membranes produced the authors found 80 water recovery with a rejection rate for ammonia higher than 95 and similar rejection rates for total organic carbon toc potassium and sodium ions the authors attributed these highly interesting results to the dense porous structure which is able to trap the molecules during their travel through the membrane with reported low fouling potential and stable water flux rates over a period of 15 days further research on these modified membranes seems worthwhile 4 3 electrodialysis for volume reduction ed has been used to produce a concentrated solution of all ions in urine an electric field and at least one pair of an anion exchange membrane aem and a cation exchange membrane cem is needed in ed to concentrate all ions while for ammonium removal via ed only a cem is needed see section 5 1 3 in most studies on urine ed urine was in direct contact with the anode and the cathode the required voltage was produced by oxidizing reduced compounds especially cod the reactors were operated as microbial fuel cells mfc ed freguia et al 2019 gao et al 2018b lu et al 2019 microbial electrolysis cells mec ed ledezma et al 2017 brewster et al 2017 tice and kim 2014 or electrolysis cells ec ed jermakka et al 2018 in ec high voltages can result in unwanted cbps see section 3 3 pronk et al 2007 and de paepe et al 2018 used conventional electrodialysis and rinsed the electrodes with a sodium sulfate or sodium nitrate solution respectively in all ed processes except for mfc electric energy is needed to apply an external voltage in general the energy demand was low as compared to distillation see table 5 the lowest energy demand observed was 1 3 kwh kgn recovered 1 when concentrating diluted nitrified urine with conventional ed calculated from data by de paepe et al 2018 despite good concentration factors see table 5 up to 50 of nitrogen 61 of the phosphate and 45 of the potassium was lost mainly to the diluate higher concentrations factors are not to be expected because volume reduction is limited by osmotic and electro osmotic water transport into the concentrate pronk et al 2006a and back diffusion of ions from the concentrate into the diluate brewster et al 2017 besides lower energy demand removal of organic micropollutants is an advantage of ed compared to distillation see section 8 2 3 however it comes at the cost of a large share of the nutrients remaining in the diluate furthermore as for all membrane processes fouling is a problem to prevent fouling pronk et al 2007 and de paepe et al 2018 pre treated the influent with microfiltration in addition de paepe et al 2018 cleaned the membranes once a month 4 4 volume reduction through nutrient uptake in algae a biological process for volume reduction would be the uptake of nutrients in algae followed by separation and possibly a drying process with typical nitrogen concentrations w w of 0 92 in urine table 1 and 6 8 in algae dry matter tuantet et al 2013 and with typical algae dry matter contents around 25 da silva et al 2008 this would result in weight reductions of only a factor of 2 for wet but a factor of 8 for dried algae however in the literature we have found only experimental results for algae growth on urine which is already quite complex but no discussion of the following separation and drying processes in several studies urine functions as a nutrient source for producing algae either for use as a slow release fertilizer as an energy crop or for the production of other chemical products from algae despite a large variability in the literature with respect to urine dilution type of algae species and reactor operation the requirement for a culture medium additional to urine is universal urine cannot on its own support substantial algae growth due to a lack of micronutrients and a high n p ratio in fresh urine of approximately 28 1 as compared to the general requirements of algae of 16 1 leading to the requirement of p addition for quantitative n removal tuantet 2015 precipitation of p during storage further increases the n p ratio and removes essential compounds like mg and ca section 2 like biological stabilization section 3 1 algae growth suffers from inhibition through salt and nitrogen compounds especially free ammonia above 140 gn m 3 tuantet et al 2013 but also high nitrate concentrations above 1000 gn m 3 coppens et al 2016 undiluted urine is therefore not a suitable substrate the best long term results were obtained by tuantet et al 2014 who optimized a continuous photo bioreactor for more than 8 months at a ph of 7 with a minimum dilution factor of 2 and the addition of the missing nutrients the maximum n uptake rate was 1300 gn m 3 d 1 and the maximum p uptake rate 150 gp m 3 d 1 in addition to the rather unsuitable nutrient composition of urine for algae growth the setup of bioreactors is challenging due to low light penetration aggravated by the dark color of urine coppens et al 2016 to overcome inhibition and improve light penetration bioreactors are typically set up for diluted urine tuantet et al 2019 showed that continuous microalgae cultivation in a photobioreactor with a light path of 5 mm is possible but that there is an inherent conflict between quantitative nitrogen removal and photosynthetic efficiency when treating urine at reasonable nitrogen concentrations between 0 77 and 2 6 g l 1 the shorter the hydraulic retention time hrt the higher the dilution factor of urine in order to prevent inhibition of the algae by free ammonia with increasing hrt both biomass concentration and nutrient removal increases but at a certain point depending on the length of the light path photosynthetic efficiency decreases due to the high biomass concentration optimizing the system would thus demand even shorter light paths than used in this study an enormous challenge for the open raceway ponds normally suggested for algae growth this was confirmed by chatterjee et al 2019 in a pilot study of a 0 5 m deep raceway pond where extremely high dilution was required even for only 50 nitrogen recovery based on the daily nitrogen excretion in urine reported in section 2 such a plant would have a footprint of 3 m2 p 1 i e 15 ha for a middle sized town of 50 000 inhabitants and is therefore hardly a realistic option apart from the challenges concerning post processing the development of a realistic photobioreactor is thus the most important research gap in the area of volume reduction of urine through algae growth 5 targeted nutrient recovery targeted nutrient recovery is primarily directed at the pollution relevant nutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p while only little efforts have been directed towards potassium k 5 1 targeted n recovery nitrogen is the most important nutrient in urine it has the highest economic value etter et al 2011 and it is responsible for the increased size and complexity of nutrient eliminating plants as well as for most of the climate effects energy demand and n2o emissions gruber et al 2020 larsen 2015 based on four papers on urine treatment maurer et al 2006 presented three technologies for targeted nitrogen recovery air stripping followed by ammonia absorption in distilled water ion exchange on zeolites and precipitation with isobutylaldehyde diurea ibdu while the ibdu precipitation was inefficient and did not lead to any follow up projects the technologies of air stripping and ion exchange have developed considerably since then 5 1 1 stripping for targeted n recovery stored urine with its high concentration of ammonia at a ph around 9 3 section 2 is highly favorable for an air stripping process morales et al 2013 showed that stored urine can be added to digester supernatant for ammonia removal but the high phosphate concentrations in urine can lead to critical precipitation table 6 provides an overview of literature results on air stripping of nitrogen from urine p removal usually precedes the stripping process to prevent problems by clogging air stripping of ammonia is facilitated by high ph and high temperature both pushing the acid base equilibrium towards volatile free ammonia basakçılardan kabakcı et al 2007 liu et al 2015 as observed from table 6 different authors have different priorities with respect to resource demand i e chemicals for ph increase and energy and removal efficiency of the process in some cases there are special reasons for these priorities pradhan et al 2017 for instance combined p removal and n stripping by increasing ph with ca oh 2 thereby inducing the precipitation of calcium phosphates section 5 2 1 in a combination of experimental work and modeling liu et al 2015 found a strong positive correlation of air stripping efficiency within the following boundaries ph 9 3 10 temperature 23 50 c and air flow rate 1 4 lair h 1 lurine 1 dilution hardly influenced the percentage of ammonia removal indicating an approximate linear correlation between ammonia concentration and process efficiency assuming that resource consumption is more or less proportional to the volume stream treated the model provides a first useful tool to weigh resource demand against nitrogen stripping efficiency according to the preferences of the stakeholders emerging technologies challenging conventional ammonia stripping are vacuum thermal stripping tao et al 2019 tian et al 2019 membrane stripping christiaens et al 2019b pradhan et al 2019 and md derese and verliefde 2016 common for these technologies is that they do not need an air stream for ammonia transfer potentially simplifying the technical setup but all technologies are still experimental christiaens et al 2019b performed a comparison with conventional stripping and found that direct liquid liquid transfer from a concentrated urine solution through a hydrophobic gas membrane could halve the energy demand required for the same result from air stripping for conventional and emerging stripping technologies the typical absorption medium is sulfuric acid boehler et al 2015 recommend a 14 m h2so4 solution to reach a 40 salt solution with 100 gn l 1 avoiding crystallization of ammonium sulfate with around 9 2 gn l 1 in undiluted urine table 1 this corresponds to a volume reduction of more than a factor of 10 however many authors use 0 5 2 m acids leading to highly dilute solutions table 6 and a higher stripping temperature leads to a higher co transfer rate of water pradhan et al 2017 in the case of vacuum thermal stripping co evaporation is so high that tao et al 2019 successfully installed a demister resulting in crystallization even in a 2 5 m h2so4 solution efficient ammonia recovery requires low ph values and typically the ph value of the absorber medium is used for control however for instance xu et al 2017 only stopped the adsorption process at ph 9 3 which resulted in 24 nitrogen loss to the atmosphere for air stripping of ammonia a combination of counter currently operated packed column stripper and absorber is standard technology antonini et al 2011 successfully improved the design by introducing recirculation of the air stream between the two columns to avoid nitrogen losses and recirculation of urine around the stripping column to improve mass transfer pradhan et al 2017 reduced ammonia loss by installing two serial absorbers we only found one example of a pilot plant running successful for 80 days wei et al 2018 achieving more than 90 nhtot removal at an hrt in the order of 5 5 6 3 minutes independently of dilution however despite air recirculation as recommended above nitrogen recovery was only 93 the main critical issue of stripping however is the required large scale of application although antonini et al 2011 applied a flow rate as low as 10 l h 1 of undiluted urine this flow rate applied 24 7 would correspond to treating the urine from more than 150 people the only long term pilot plant was run at a loading rate of 7 8 m3 h 1 of urine diluted by a factor of 4 wei et al 2018 which would correspond to treating the urine of more than 30 000 people in order to be relevant at the scale of an apartment building a small scale column setup and automatic control system would be necessary while the emerging alternatives discussed above avoid at least the air stripping column and therefore seem simpler and better suited for small scale application these technologies are still only experimental 5 1 2 adsorption processes for targeted n recovery whereas ammonia stripping is associated with large scale columns the adsorption technology with no moving parts seems perfect for small scale applications maurer et al 2006 already reported first experience with ion exchange on zeolites for targeted nhtot recovery from stored urine and in fact zeolites are still by far the preferred adsorption material for targeted n recovery because zeolites are excellent soil conditioners for increasing nutrient and water retention of poor soils ramesh and reddy 2011 the product is always intended directly as fertilizer as is biochar another absorber material used for nitrogen recovery for a thorough discussion of adsorption mechanisms and an overview of the experimental results see the excellent review of kabdaşlı and tünay 2018 only tarpeh et al 2017 have tested other adsorbents for nitrogen recovery table 7 for biochar maximum adsorption densities in real urine is similar to the ones for zeolites whereas some synthetic cation exchange resins were more effective reaching a maximal ammonium adsorption density of up to 64 mgn g 1 a factor 7 weight reduction this is substantial and although slightly lower than for stripping the technology is simpler for small scale installations the price for the higher adsorption capacity is the requirement for a subsequent regeneration step preferably with a strong acid with the extent of desorption widely depending on the adsorbent material tarpeh et al 2017 this also sets a limit to the lifetime of the synthetic material there are few examples of an installation of ion exchangers beyond the lab recently tarpeh et al 2018b did a first successful pilot installation of the synthetic resin dowex mac 3 for ammonium recovery in kenya in cooperation with the social enterprise sanergy this first pilot phase showed similar adsorption densities as in the lab but only a longer term installation will reveal the sustainability of the business model nitrogen in the form of urea is the only non ionic nutrient in urine until now one group of researchers have tested the adsorption of urea to biochar with results ranging from highly surprising 750 mgurea g 1 in batch experiments ganesapillai et al 2015 to more realistic 94 mgurea g 1 44 mgn g 1 in column experiments simha et al 2018b these and similar experiments were all conducted at neutral ph where urea is not stable and some hydrolysis may have interfered with the urea measurements for practical purposes results from urea stabilized urine section 3 2 will be required in order to compare adsorption of urea and ammonium on biochar the latter as reported in table 7 and to evaluate whether the additional stabilization is worth the effort 5 1 3 electrochemical processes for targeted n recovery ed has frequently been used to move ammonium from urine towards a cathode for subsequent recovery in this application of ed only a cem is needed which allows the selective migration of cations including ammonium to the cathode fig 1 the high ph value at the cathode can then be used for ammonia stripping either with air or through membranes see section 5 1 1 the electric field required for ed can be produced with a mfc kuntke et al 2012 mec kuntke et al 2018 kuntke et al 2017 ledezma et al 2017 rodríguez arredondo et al 2019 zamora et al 2017b or ec system christiaens et al 2019a christiaens et al 2017 luther et al 2015 tarpeh et al 2018a kuntke et al 2012 reported that the coulombic efficiency in an mfc was only 10 i e only 10 of the electrons released from cod degradation contributed to the electric current and thereby to cation transport in the electric field furthermore only 31 of the current was used for ammonium transport while most of the current was used to transport other cations such as sodium potassium and protons kuntke et al 2017 however the low transport of ammonium was somewhat compensated by the diffusion of uncharged free ammonia in the study of kuntke et al 2012 at least 42 of the nhtot was transported via free ammonia diffusion the contribution of free ammonia diffusion became actually the dominant ammonia transport mechanism at low current densities the same research group showed that the electro migration of ammonium can be substantially enhanced with mecs zamora et al 2017a reported that 92 of nhtot was transported through the cem this high electro migration of ammonium correlated with a high coulombic efficiency of 70 the process was also faster than in the mfc study kuntke et al 2012 because the current densities were up to 100 times higher 50 a m 2 after moving the ammonium to the cathode it must be stripped from the cathode chamber by air stripping e g kuntke et al 2012 or through a membrane to be absorbed in an acid e g zamora et al 2017a and tarpeh et al 2018a the study by zamora et al 2017a showed that the limiting step for final ammonia recovery is not the removal of ammonia from urine but the capture of the removed ammonium in the acid while 92 of the total ammonia was transported through the cem only 31 was finally absorbed in sulfuric acid the highest nhtot recovery for real urine was reported by tarpeh et al 2018a when combining an ec ed with ammonia stripping through gas permeable membranes they could recover 93 of the nhtot in the acid in batch mode and 50 in continuous mode however they also showed that substantial amounts of ammonia can be lost by the oxidation with chlorine which can be formed at the anode kuntke et al 2017 actually presented a method to prevent chlorine formation at the anode by recycling hydrogen from the cathode to the anode high anode potentials could be prevented and thereby the production of chlorine and cbps furthermore the availability of hydrogen also reduced the consumption of organic compounds at the anode in most studies on electrochemical ammonia stripping a synthetic catholyte was used only in two studies christiaens et al 2017 christiaens et al 2019b was urine treated directly at the cathode after entering the cathode chamber it was directed into the anode chamber ammonia was later absorbed in sulfuric acid or in a solution with hydrogen oxidizing bacteria to produce microbial protein christiaens et al 2017 5 2 targeted p recovery based on the experience from conventional wastewater treatment precipitation is the natural process choice for targeted p recovery from urine although also anion exchange has been attempted it is not always clear if in fact ion exchange and not precipitation is at least partially responsible for the removal effects 5 2 1 precipitation processes for targeted p recovery in wastewater phosphate precipitates with iron aluminum magnesium and calcium ions these ions have equally proven successful for recovering phosphorus from urine but precipitation with mg2 is by far the most popular process for this purpose one reason for this may be the large focus on p recovery for fertilizer whereas magnesium ammonium phosphate map is recognized as a good plant fertilizer harder et al 2019 plant availability of iron and aluminum phosphate and possible toxicity of the latter is heavily debated see e g mocker et al 2011 however these simple technologies may prove suitable for collecting p at the source for later industrial fertilizer production table 8 lists the best results obtained from the literature for precipitation processes for p recovery from urine for map production the literature is extensive experimental evidence shows that particle formation is fast in the order of less than 20 seconds supported by the initial presence of small particles triger et al 2012 map solubility correlates positively with temperature ronteltap et al 2007b and particle size increases with decreasing super saturation βs i e with increasing temperature and decreasing ph and with increasing turbulence preventing water packets with high super saturation ronteltap et al 2010 rodrigues et al 2019 supported these findings and determined an optimum saturation index si log10 βs between 2 7 and 3 5 for simultaneously obtaining high phosphorus recovery and large particle sizes with a higher contact time supporting crystal growth for the other precipitation processes there is substantial less information in the literature precipitation of phosphate with aluminum is only successful at low ph values due to the formation of competing compounds table 8 in essence this means that only stabilized urine is suitable as substrate section 3 for the production of fepo4 there is less agreement in the literature in experiments using a sacrificial iron electrode for the dosing of iron zheng et al 2009 reported excellent results at ph 9 i e close to the ph of stored urine in an experiment dosing iron as fecl3 kabdaşlı et al 2019 found that above ph 7 5 the formation of fe oh 3 flocs rendered the process inefficient in the latter case again only stabilized urine would be a suitable substrate due to competing caco3 production precipitation of phosphate with ca2 is only recommended for fresh urine which contains negligible concentrations of bicarbonate table 8 the challenge of a practical reactor setup has been taken up only for map and magnesium potassium phosphate mpp precipitation table 9 see section 5 3 for mpp precipitation scaling problems in cstrs originally observed by wilsenach et al 2007 was solved by initial seeding and the establishment of a more distinct settling zone aguado et al 2019 particle separation in cstrs was only a major problem in the study of wei et al 2018 where small particles escaped the settling tank as well as the additional sieve zamora et al 2017a obtained the largest map crystals in a four phased fluidized bed reactor fbr reactor which was specifically designed for crystal growth with a decreasing flow rate along the vertical flow axis with online measurements of the p concentration in the influent to determine optimal mg2 dosing zhang et al 2017 used the same setup for mpp production and obtained even larger crystals at an optimized si of 3 0 for low income countries etter et al 2011 developed a low cost hand driven reactor with an external filtration system coarse nylon filter which was later automatized with good results by grau et al 2015 using online signals of turbidity or electric conductivity for optimizing magnesium dosage the choice of chemicals for precipitation is interesting from the aspect of costs and reactor setup for map production a large number of waste products have been employed aguado et al 2019 dai et al 2014 etter et al 2011 krähenbühl et al 2016 liu et al 2013 rubio rincón et al 2014 sakthivel et al 2012 all those sources provided mg2 as desired often giving rise to impurities in the struvite product but only wood ash would influence the fertilizer product negatively due to the high content of heavy metals sakthivel et al 2012 total costs depend on the local availability of the waste resources as well as on operational costs e g for precipitant dosing an alternative to using cheap waste products is thus to lower these operational costs e g by using sacrificial electrodes as done by hug and udert 2013 for dosing mg2 by zheng et al 2009 for dosing fe3 and by zheng et al 2010 for dosing al3 5 2 2 adsorption processes for targeted p recovery for the adsorption of phosphorus we have only found examples of anion exchange o neal and boyer 2013 and sendrowski and boyer 2013 tested the implementation of a commercial anion exchange resin loaded with hydrous ferric oxide nanoparticles sendrowski and boyer 2013 set up kinetic and equilibrium models for synthetic fresh and stored urine concluding that kinetics were faster for fresh than for stored synthetic urine but that in both cases the maximum adsorption capacity on the resin was around 5 2 mgpo4 g 1 corresponding to 0 17 mmolp g 1 in subsequent experiments in the same system on fresh and stored urine o neal and boyer 2013 found higher maximum adsorption capacities of 10 1 and 6 9 mgpo4 gresin 1 respectively and 92 phosphorus recovery during regeneration of the resin by a nacl naoh solution dox et al 2019 investigated the use of mgal or znal layered double hydroxides ldh to recover phosphorus from urine by ion exchange with the intention of direct use in agriculture as a slow release p fertilizer the authors obtained the best results with a mgal ldh with an adsorption capacity of 64 mgp gldh 1 for synthetic stored urine at ph 6 but with indications from experiments with a p solution that this value would be around 15 lower at a realistic ph value of stored urine this is still better than the 5 10 g mgp gionexchanger 1 cited above but we found no explicit discussion of the suitability of aluminum based ion exchangers for soil conditioning furthermore when it comes to weight reduction ion exchange cannot compete with precipitation kabdaşlı et al 2013 with respect to the complex production of synthetic anion exchangers it still has to be proven that a possibly simpler operation can compensate for the disadvantage of lower volume reduction in some cases we can attribute apparent adsorption to precipitation xu et al 2019b attempted to provide al3 ca2 fe3 and mg2 ions coated on biochar but this was only successful for the dosing of mg2 most probably due to precipitation equally ganrot et al 2008 reported apparent adsorption densities up to 10 mgp g 1 on the cation exchanger zeolite while ganrot 2012 attributes this effect to anion exchange capacity of hydrous oxides of al structural sites wan et al 2017 could show that calcium ions released from zeolites lead to phosphorus precipitation in sludge reject water with the latter explanation also fitting better to the data for urine 5 3 targeted k recovery a few authors suggest recovering phosphorus as mpp instead of map for thermodynamic reasons previous nhtot removal is necessary to prevent the more favorable process of map precipitation e g by stripping gao et al 2018a huang et al 2019 or nitrification denitrification wilsenach et al 2007 both processes would lead to a substantial ph decrease which is unfavorable for the process using mgo as magnesium source leads to a suitable ph value table 9 and sufficient depletion of nitrogen by stripping section 5 1 1 would necessitate the addition of a base in the first place huang et al 2019 xu et al 2015 due to local difficulties of securing k fertilizer xu et al 2017 and xu et al 2011 attempted to optimize the process for k recovery by the addition of surplus p but despite adopting a high mg p ratio concomitant high removal rates of k and p were not achieved 6 nutrient removal only nitrogen already maurer et al 2006 suggested biological denitrification as well as electrochemical processes for nitrogen removal at the time only autotrophic denitrification had been tested in one successful short term experiment treating urine with sludge from a running anammox process 6 1 biological denitrification quantitative biological denitrification requires previous complete nitrification or nitritation we discussed complete nitrification in section 3 1 2 but will discuss partial and complete nitritation in this section before we proceed to the actual denitrification processes for a general short background on nitrification and inhibition we refer to section 3 1 6 1 1 partial and complete nitritation already maurer et al 2006 reported that due to inhibition of nitrite oxidizers early attempts to obtain partial nitrification in reactors with suspended solids only resulted in partial nitritation sun et al 2012 observed the same effect for a sequencing batch reactor sbr and an mbr not only for partial but also in the case of complete nitrification where others have achieved successful nitrification with suspended biomass operational conditions i e temperature ph and urine dilution were similar to the ones reported in table 2 for successful nitrification in a similar experiment on complete nitrification mackey et al 2016 achieved complete nitritation in a granular sludge sbr reactor by dosing sodium bicarbonate the authors hypothesize that the higher ph value up to 9 as compared to earlier nitrification experiments in a similar system at ph 7 3 7 6 by jiang et al 2011 lead to a stronger inhibition of nob than of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob resulting in nitrite accumulation pulse feeding was important for sustaining the granules and at an inlet nhtot concentration of 1500 gn m 3 nitritation rates of up to 1100 gn m 3 d 1 were obtained 6 1 2 heterotrophic denitrification of a nitrate or nitrite solution for urine heterotrophic denitrification of a nitrate or nitrite solution has been suggested the minimum cod n ratio for complete denitrification via nitrate and nitrite is 2 86 gcod gn 1 and 1 71 gcod gn 1 respectively not taking into account the cod demand for microbial growth udert and jenni 2013 the cod n ratio of around 1 in urine table 1 is consequently too low to support complete heterotrophic denitrification for this reason the process has mainly been suggested for nitrogen removal in sewers with ample provision of cod and for hydrogen sulfide control in pressure sewers in the latter case nitrate and nitrite can replace sulfate as electron acceptor thereby preventing biogenic sulfide corrosion jiang et al 2011 oosterhuis and van loosdrecht 2009 not surprisingly jiang et al 2011 could show that heterotrophic denitrification can be obtained through the addition of nitrified urine to raw wastewater the use of nitrite as electron acceptor may in some cases be attractive because it requires less cod for denitrification and its toxicity inhibits the growth of sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogens additionally increasing the chances of total nitrogen removal through denitrification in sewers mackey et al 2016 however whereas denitrification via nitrate is a well studied process from conventional wastewater treatment the same process via nitrite can lead to substantial production of volatile nitrogen oxides including climate relevant n2o schreiber et al 2012 we have found no explicit studies on this potential detrimental effect of nitrite reduction in sewer systems but we note that due to the fish toxicity of nitrite the process would only be relevant in systems without combined sewer overflows 6 1 3 nitritation anammox single and two stage process based on stoichiometry nitritation anammox would have a large potential for nitrogen removal from urine without additional cod udert et al 2008 however schielke jenni et al 2015 showed that in a single stage process nitritation anammox and heterotrophic denitrification will coincide and their contribution to nitrogen removal cannot be differentiated with a reasonable amount of measurements studies by bürgmann et al 2011 and huang et al 2016 have shown that single stage nitritation anammox is possible for nhtot removal from diluted urine bürgmann et al 2011 reported nitrogen removal rates of more than 430 gn m 3 d 1 with an average nhtot concentration in the influent of 590 gn m 3 but for still unknown reasons the process requires exact process control in order to prevent irreversible regime shifts to a population with low anammox activity and long term operation was not achieved competition by heterotrophic bacteria alone cannot be the explanation in experiments with sludge filtrate augmented with cod jenni et al 2014 showed perfect coexistence of the anammox process and heterotrophic denitrification in concentrated solutions successful nitritation anammox for undiluted urine has not been reported so far schielke jenni 2015 suggests that salt effects or inhibition by specific organic compounds are the two most likely reasons for nitritation anammox treatment of urine being challenging as already reported by maurer et al 2006 and suggested by chen et al 2017 partial nitritation as discussed in section 6 1 1 could be suitable for a two stage nitritation anammox process however schielke jenni et al 2015 were unsuccessful in maintaining stable nitrogen removal in a two stage process consisting of a continuous flow stirred tank reactor cstr for nitritation and an sbr with suspended biomass for anammox the anammox activity broke down soon after the influent was switched from digester supernatant to urine despite the attractive idea of removing nitrogen through nitritation anammox in urine the complexity seems to be high 6 2 electrochemical nitrogen removal electrolysis has been used to remove nitrogen compounds i e urea in fresh urine and nhtot in stored urine in most of these studies indirect oxidation with chlorine or hydroxyl radicals was the main mechanism see section 3 3 but direct oxidation at the anode was also reported zöllig et al 2017 investigated the electrolysis of real stored urine in batch experiments with bdd and tdirof besides ammonia cod was also degraded on bdd ammonia oxidation was slow until all cod was degraded but increased ten times after cod was removed table 10 the preferential removal of cod on bdd was probably due to breakdown of large organic molecules into small compounds by hydroxyl radicals the small organic molecules were preferentially oxidized by chlorine on tdirof ammonia and cod were degraded concomitantly from the beginning at a high rate table 10 energy demand was higher for bdd table 10 but it must be taken into account that the experiment with tdirof was shorter and the energy intensive phase with low ammonia and cod concentrations was not observed in experiments using tdirof amstutz et al 2012 reported a substantially lower efficiency for nitrogen removal from synthetic stored urine than from synthetic fresh urine ammonia electrolysis was slowed down because carbonate oxidation to percarbonate prevented the formation of chlorine which is necessary for the indirect oxidation of ammonia a later study zöllig et al 2017 with the same type of electrodes on real stored urine however did not confirm these findings the authors argued that the ph value and the carbonate concentration in real stored urine were too low to cause substantial competition by percarbonate formation in most studies on nitrogen removal with electrolysis residual nitrate was formed for example zöllig et al 2017 reported that 35 of the initial ammonia in real stored urine was converted to nitrate on bdd amstutz et al 2012 found that 24 of the initial urea and ammonia in synthetic fresh urine was converted to nitrate on tdirof shen et al 2019 developed a system for complete nitrogen removal batch experiments with real fresh urine in an ec with a photoanode and a selectively reductive pd au n f palladium gold nickel foam cathode resulted in total nitrogen and toc removal efficiencies of 99 and 55 respectively the two main challenges of electrolytic treatment of urine at high current densities are the high energy demand table 10 and the production of harmful cbps section 3 3 both effects are connected to the production of chlorine direct ammonia oxidation without mediation by chlorine was reported by amstutz et al 2012 for urea removal in fresh synthetic urine and by zöllig et al 2015a for ammonia removal in real stored urine zöllig et al 2015a showed that ammonia can be removed on cheap graphite when the anode potential is kept between 1 1 and 1 6 v versus a standard hydrogen electrode she in batch experiments at 1 31 v vs she an ammonia removal rate of 2 9 gn m 2 d 1 and an energy demand of 42 kwh kgn 1 was achieved table 10 the degradation rates were substantially lower than for indirect oxidation but in the same range as for denitrifying biofilm systems see table 10 it must be noted that direct ammonia oxidation can be limited by a local ph decrease at the anode because free ammonia but not ammonium reacts at the anode zöllig et al 2015b one alternative to energy consuming electrolysis could be urea degradation in fuel cells fc table 10 see also section 7 the degradation rate is close to the values for indirect electrolysis and is substantially higher than for direct electrolysis or biological denitrification furthermore in the electrochemical process of an fc energy is produced and not consumed however only few studies exist about fc treatment of urine and little to nothing is known about possible operational challenges if fc are operated on a long term 7 energy recovery energy recovery from urine was not reported by maurer et al 2006 since then fc and most notably mfc have been investigated for the direct production of electricity from urine in fc applications urea from fresh urine is oxidized at the anode while in mfc the electron donors are organic substances with a chemical oxygen demand i e substances which contain reduced carbon mfc can be fed with fresh or stored urine the maximum power production in fc and mfc is below 1 w p 1 table 11 and therefore too low to substantially contribute to the electricity demand of an industrialized country for comparison the average electric power consumption in switzerland was 760 w p 1 in 2019 bfe 2020 also the achievable power densities per anode surface are low lan and tao 2011 reported a maximum of 11 w m 2 for fc at 20 c with fresh urine while barbosa et al 2017 reported 0 95 w m 2 for mfc with stored urine these values were measured in short term polarization experiments in long term mfc experiments the power densities are even lower with reported power densities of 250 mw m 2 kuntke et al 2012 311 mw m 2 zhou et al 2015 and 314 mw m 2 barbosa et al 2017 for fc no continuous long term experiments have been reported all reported power densities for fc and mfc are substantially lower than the power densities which can be achieved in hydrogen fc xu et al 2016a cited values of 5000 to 6000 w m 2 for proton exchange membrane fc operated with hydrogen the amount of energy which can be recovered from a substrate depends on the extent of substrate degradation and on the coulombic efficiency a typical coulombic efficiency for mfc is around 25 see e g barbosa et al 2017 but values vary widely ieropoulos et al 2012 reported values between 22 and 70 and santoro et al 2014 reported only 2 1 with urine while the cod removal efficiency was 85 possible reasons for low coulombic efficiencies are the competition with other cod consuming processes such as sulfate reduction santoro et al 2013 methanogenesis barbosa et al 2017 or the consumption of oxygen which diffuses from the cathode into the anode chamber liu et al 2004 in contrast to mfc coulombic efficiencies in fc can be very high xu et al 2016b reported a coulombic efficiency of 98 when using a cr vi solution as catholyte however we did not find any other values for the coulombic efficiency in urine fc in addition to the low power production the material costs are an additional challenge for electricity production material costs can be particularly high for anodes used in fc to reduce costs lan et al 2010 studied the use of nickel instead of platinum as anode material lan and tao 2011 and xu et al 2014 aimed at increasing the performance of nickel anodes by using nano sized nickel or nickel alloys with cobalt respectively while anodes of mfc usually consist of cheap graphite the focus of reducing material costs for mfc has been mainly on cem instead of engineered cem ceramic membranes pasternak et al 2016 natural rubber gloves winfield et al 2014 and different types of paper winfield et al 2015 were tested however the most promising setups are single chamber mfc with membrane less air cathodes e g santorio et al 2013 since urine based fc and mfc cannot contribute substantially to the overall electricity consumption of a society researchers explored special applications e g small or mobile devices such as mobile phone chargers ieropoulos et al 2013b heartbeat actuators walters et al 2013 emergency location transmitters winfield et al 2015 or wireless transmitters taghavi et al 2015 in practical applications stacks of small mfc are used to increase power densities and to prevent cell polarity reversal ieropoulos et al 2013a additionally the stacks are arranged in series see e g ieropoulos et al 2013b to increase the low voltage of single mfc see table 11 while electricity production from urine with mfc and fc is probably only interesting for some niche applications these systems could provide fast and energy efficient cod or nitrogen removal respectively see sections 3 3 and 6 2 in some studies on electrochemical urine treatment energy rich hydrogen is produced at the cathode kim et al 2013 and luther et al 2015 calculated energy savings of 10 and 36 if hydrogen was used to recover electricity in a fuel cell christiaens et al 2017 produced protein with the help of hydrogen oxidizing bacteria a totally different approach of energy recovery was used by mercer et al 2019 the authors showed that after water removal by md part of the thermal energy could be recovered as electrical energy with reverse ed the authors suggest that such a system could be used to convert waste heat used for md to electricity in order to support the electricity requirements of off grid sanitation systems in low income countries 8 removal of pathogens and organic micropollutants 8 1 removal of pathogens although urine is normally free of pathogens as long as it is contained in the human bladder fecal contamination often occurs during urine collection in urine diverting toilets or urinals consequently storage to obtain sufficient sanitization for direct use of urine as fertilizer was one of the first processes reported for source separated urine maurer et al 2006 in view of the importance surprisingly little effort has been invested in the methods for sanitization since then except for one unsuccessful example of ultraviolet radiation uv inactivation of pathogens in urine giannakis et al 2018 pathogen inactivation or separation from the nutrients has mainly been reported or can be assumed as a side effect of a main urine treatment process distillation at temperatures beyond 55 c lead to heat inactivation and during nitrogen stripping we expect the non volatile pathogens to remain in the solution for alkaline drying senecal et al 2018 investigated the fate of pathogens after dehydration of urine in wood ash all bacteria and phages were removed to below the detection limit within four days of storage at 20 c but the nematode ascaris suum required substantial time in order to obtain a log 3 reduction 325 days at 20 c and 9 2 days at 42 c however the expected concentration of nematodes in the resulting fertilizer product would already be below the who guidelines for unrestricted use due to the limited fecal contamination of urine in many other cases we must expect drying combined with short heat treatments to be the most obvious method of sanitization this would only be counter indicated in the case of struvite which decomposes at temperatures above 55 c bhuiyan et al 2008 giving rise to ammonia losses decrey et al 2011 and bischel et al 2016 investigated the inactivation of virus phages helminth eggs ascaris suum heterotrophic and total bacteria as well as enterococcus spp and salmonella typhimurium during drying of struvite all at 5 35 c and at a relative humidity of 40 80 higher temperatures and decreased moisture increased deactivation but it was concluded that a short heat treatment above 55 c before drying would be required for the struvite product from urine to be safe for use in agriculture bischel et al 2015b investigated the fate of viral and bacterial pathogen surrogates during urine nitrification they found that some inactivation occurred but they concluded that nitrification was insufficient as a stand alone technology for sanitization of source separated urine 8 2 removal of organic micropollutants from conventional wwtps it is known that while biological treatment alone will not lead to sufficient removal activated carbon is effective for unspecific removal of organic micropollutants from treated wastewater albeit with strong competition from dissolved organic matter benstoem et al 2017 for urine it may thus be most economic to use the method after biological treatment see section 3 1 but up to 2019 we have found no scientific articles on this topic in practice however the effective removal of organic micropollutants from biologically treated urine by activated carbon has led to the licensing of the urine based fertilizer aurin for all crops in switzerland www vuna ch ozonation is another well established process for unspecific removal of micropollutants in wastewater again in strong competition with the oxidation of organic matter bourgin et al 2018 the process functions for urine too but with a much higher energy demand than for wastewater treatment and a high production of toxic by products dodd et al 2008 fitzke and geißen 2007 gajurel et al 2007 gulyas et al 2007 tettenborn et al 2007 there has been no follow up publications on the topic since 2008 for urine there are two different main goals when dealing with organic micropollutants separation from nutrients and removal with a focus on fertilizer production one may consider the separation of nutrients and organic micropollutants sufficient this effect has mainly been shown for precipitation of struvite where ronteltap et al 2007a and wei et al 2018 observed consistent low inclusion with 95 99 of the spiked organic micropollutants remaining in the liquid other authors reported inclusion only before washing de boer et al 2018 or without indicating any washing of the struvite crystals schürmann et al 2012 in fresh urine nano filtration nf has been tested for separation of nutrients from micropollutants lazarova and spendlingwimmer 2008 report close to 90 retention of the micropollutants but only 40 permeation of urea this is in contrast to previous results on nf where pronk et al 2006b found excellent permeation of urea in addition cristóvão et al 2019 studied the separation of anticancer drugs from synthetic fresh urine by nf with more than 89 rejection by the best nf material albeit with close to 20 co rejection of urea and monovalent ions and 32 99 for multivalent ions with a focus on water pollution control there is a large opportunity for removal of organic micropollutants from urine and not only for separation see section 1 for a discussion for urine with low cod content activated carbon has already proven highly effective in practice for urine with a high content of cod however there is a considerable research gap with only little information available whereas many authors have performed experiments on advanced oxidation processes aops and adsorption with the purpose of removing one or several pharmaceuticals the majority conducted the experiments with synthetic urine containing no or little cod we therefore only give a short summary of the literature on these processes in order to show where some process information is available as a basis to conduct further experiments with real urine containing realistic amounts of cod we note that after 2019 there has been a long required boost of publications on the removal of organic micropollutants which we unfortunately did not catch in this review 8 2 1 advanced oxidation processes aops low pressure uv alone or in combination with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 peroxydisulfate pds and h2o2 fenton has been tested on different drugs in synthetic urine with the combinations with pds and h2o2 fenton reaching the best results giannakis et al 2017a giannakis et al 2017b giannakis et al 2017c zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a zhang et al 2016b further luo et al 2019 tested ferrate feo4 2 and wang et al 2019 biochar activated monochloramine for the oxidation of selected pharmaceuticals both with good results in the selected settings 8 2 2 adsorption processes for removal of organic micropollutants adsorption has not only been suggested for removal of organic micropollutants but also for targeted recovery of nutrients sections 5 1 2 and 5 2 2 only few authors however have questioned whether co adsorption of nutrients and organic micropollutants would play a role tarpeh et al 2017 for instance proposed post treatment for removal of organic micropollutants after nutrient adsorption only sendrowski and boyer 2013 tested co adsorption experimentally and in fact found high co removal of the pharmaceutical diclofenac in an anion exchange process for p recovery a number of authors have studied the adsorption of specific pharmaceuticals on adsorbents of different origin mostly biochars paredes laverde et al 2019 paredes laverde et al 2018 solanki and boyer 2017 sun et al 2018 and strong base anion exchange resin landry and boyer 2013 landry et al 2015 the authors mostly found no significant differences between fresh and stored synthetic urine only few of the authors addressed the two major concerns for adsorption of organic micropollutants competition from dissolved organic matter and possible co adsorption of nutrients solanki and boyer 2019 found significant lower adsorption on biochar for real than for synthetic urine but again with no differences between fresh and stored urine based on batch experiments the authors suggest to use the double amount of biochar than for synthetic urine i e 40 gbiochar l 1 corresponding to 60 gbiochar p 1 d 1 as seen in section 5 1 2 biochar is used for targeted nitrogen removal in fresh and stored urine at high ph values leading to excellent results we would therefore expect substantial co adsorption of nitrogen in both types of urine in fact solanki and boyer 2017 observed exactly this with the problem being especially pronounced for activated carbon with 20 n removal and a little more surprisingly also 40 p removal while it was difficult to prove the actual removal mechanisms the authors argue that in both cases co adsorption would be a plausible explanation in municipal wastewater treatment however adsorption of ammonia or phosphate on activated carbon is commonly not observed 8 2 3 pharmaceutical removal in electrochemical processes in a few studies ecs were used to remove pharmaceuticals either by oxidation or reduction on the one hand indirect oxidation on bdd cotillas et al 2018 and ti iro2 anodes jojoa sierra et al 2017 was shown to be a suitable process for antibiotics removal pharmaceuticals and intermediates could be removed completely though degradation of organic compounds slowed down their oxidation on the other hand de gusseme et al 2011 investigated the reductive dehalogenation of the iodinated x ray contrast medium diatrizoate in an mec with a cathode containing biogenic palladium nanoparticles ed was tested on the removal of pharmaceuticals with membranes pronk et al 2007 reported that during a one year long pilot experiment with real stored urine diclofenac carbamazepine and propranol were removed below the detection limit while ibuprofen was removed to a large extent in addition estrogenic activity was reduced by 90 9 qualitative comparison of technologies the technology overview in table 12 shows that many technologies are well understood with respect to the recovery or removal of nutrients water and cod the main knowledge gaps exist for pathogen and micropollutant removal for some processes a certain performance during urine treatment can be assumed based on known properties of the technologies we presumed that membranes used for nanofiltration membrane distillation and cation and anion exchange provide a good removal of pathogens and pharmaceuticals based on studies by pronk et al 2006 for nanofiltration and pronk et al 2007 for ed from conventional wastewater treatment it is known that processes like ozonation and aop are well suited for pathogen removal during distillation urine is heated to approximately 80 c which is above the requirements for pasteurization for all biological processes we presumed no substantial effect on pathogen removal based on the study by bischel et al 2015 for urine nitrification a quantitative assessment of the suitability of the technologies was not the goal of this paper however this review can serve as a first step towards such an assessment which should also include the resource demand of the different technologies besides energy and chemical consumables the resource demand should also include installation and maintenance costs for reactors as well as space requirements however for most technologies much of this information is not available yet or not reliable due to the low technology readiness level 10 conclusions our review for the years 2006 2019 has shown that the research community has made tremendous progress in the development of urine treatment technologies no industrialized urine treatment reactors exist to date for any of the processes but many technologies are close to industrial optimization based on our review we see the following trends for the further development for urine treatment technologies urine treatment should be as close as possible to the source to prevent transport costs most technologies were therefore developed for reactors at bathroom scale or at the scale of larger building or building complexes physical chemical processes especially alkaline stabilization combined with evaporation adsorption or membrane separation processes seem to be particular suitable at bath room scale challenges are the requirements for reagents energy and maintenance such as membrane cleansing biological processes are arguably the most efficient technologies for urine stabilization but due to possible inhibition effects by salt or free ammonia they are more robust at larger scale efficient processes for water removal such as distillation or for nutrient recovery such as ammonia stripping and phosphate precipitation are also better suited for large scale application due to their technical complexity a growing new field of technologies involve electrochemical processes they provide new possibilities such as electricity generation or on site disinfection but challenges such as low efficiencies and high process complexities still need to be overcome most technologies developed so far focus on nutrient recovery or removal more development is needed for the removal of pathogens and micropollutants however it should be noted that since 2019 important improvements have been made which were not included in this review another topic to be investigated in more detail is the treatment or disposal of side streams especially in the case of single nutrient recovery processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests kai m udert is co owner of the eawag spin off vuna ltd the company uses biological and physical processes for nutrient recovery from urine the study was not influenced by the

19936,benzotriazole ultraviolet stabilizers during a runoff event boluwatife awonaike ying duan lei abha parajulee frank wania department of physical and environmental sciences university of toronto scarborough 1265 military trail ontario m1c 1a4 canada department of physical and environmental sciences university of toronto scarborough 1265 military trail ontario m1c 1a4 canada department of physical and environmental sciences university of toronto scarborough 1265 military trail ontario m1c 1a4 canada corresponding author benzotriazole ultraviolet stabilizers bt uvs are ubiquitous in the environment given their wide use as additives in consumer products their bio accumulative and toxic properties are increasingly being scrutinised evinced by the recent proposition to add uv328 to the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants here we measured concentrations of six bt uvs in the dissolved and particulate phases of stream water collected from an urban and rural stream during a runoff event under baseflow conditions the less hydrophobic bt uvs were present at low concentrations in the dissolved phase while much higher loads of particulate bt uvs occurred during stormflow especially in the urban creek time weighted average bt uv concentrations were up to 4 times higher in the urban than in the rural creek bt uvs were found to be prevalent in water obtained from laundering textiles which plausibly constitutes a major portion of domestic wastewater and can serve as a bt uv source to aquatic waterways however the observed dilution of a sewage tracer during the run off event suggests that unregulated wastewater seepage is not responsible for the high bt uv loads in storm water high levels of uv328 and uv234 were detected in a select few plastic debris items collected from the urban watershed and in artificial turf grass respectively whereas this may allow for the leaching of those bt uvs into the creek most plastic debris is more likely a sink than a source of bt uvs the observed input of particle bound bt uvs at the onset of the rain event indicates that most of the bt uvs reach the creek with contaminated particles that had built up on surfaces during the antecedent dry period uv328 was the dominant bt uv in those particles if such particle build up occurs on road surfaces it may suggest that the use of uv328 in automotive applications contributes to their presence in urban storm water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultraviolet stabilizers plastics urban runoff precipitation 1 introduction due to their ability to absorb the full spectrum of ultraviolet uv light benzotriazole ultraviolet stabilizers bt uvs which have a phenolic group attached to the benzotriazole ring are used in a variety of products particularly those constantly exposed to sunlight this is done to prevent yellowing and degradation that could result from prolonged exposure to uv radiation andrady and rajapakse 2016 such widespread use leads to detectable concentrations of bt uvs in environmental matrices which have been reported for surface water lu et al 2016 sea water montesdeoca esponda et al 2020 sediment cantwell et al 2015 biota lu et al 2019 wastewater song et al 2014 and plastic debris rani et al 2017 the toxic and bio accumulative properties of bt uvs are well documented kim et al 2011 liang et al 2019 and as a result some bt uvs have been classified under the european registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach regulation as substances of very high concern european chemicals agency echa 2014 in canada from as early as 1986 63 of imported uv328 a member of this group has been used in the plastics sector and the rest in automotive paints and coatings environment and climate change canada 2016 analysis of suspended sediment collected from mimico creek located in an urbanized watershed in toronto canada showed relatively high concentrations of bt uvs 13 240 ng g especially uvp uv328 and uv234 parajulee et al 2018 whereas wastewater has been shown to be a vector of bt uvs into aquatic environments lu et al 2017 mimico creek receives no direct wastewater effluent suggesting the presence of an alternate source of bt uvs one objective of this study was to elucidate the sources of bt uvs to mimico creek and thereby also to urban surface waters elsewhere the three possible sources of bt uvs being considered include plastics unregulated wastewater input and atmospheric washout plastics in the environment are broadly divided into macro plastics 5 mm and microplastics 5 mm hahladakis et al 2018 microplastics can further be classified as primary and secondary the former are specifically manufactured in the 5 mm range and include pre production pellets and microbeads used in personal care products horton et al 2017 napper et al 2015 whereas the latter are formed from the fragmentation of larger plastic pieces upon entering the environment barnes et al 2009 thompson 2004 manufactured plastic materials often contain a wide range of additives i e chemical compounds added to improve the performance functionality and ageing properties of the polymer hahladakis et al 2018 these include uv stabilizers which are typically added to consumer products at concentrations of 0 05 3 by weight of the polymer and in most cases are not chemically bound to the plastic polymer increasing their potential to leach out of the plastic hahladakis et al 2018 the presence of additive containing plastics could over time result in weathering induced migration of these chemicals into the surrounding environment as has been observed previously for bt uvs gao et al 2011 hahladakis et al 2018 plastic particles in aquatic systems could further act as vectors for the transport of pollutants mato et al 2001 considering the widespread occurrence of plastic debris and the presence of plastic manufacturing and distribution industries in the mimico creek watershed we hypothesized that the informal disposal of consumer plastics and industrial pre production pellets could play a role in the bt uv contamination of the creek the use of bt uvs in textiles and fabrics provides a route for bt uvs from consumer homes to wastewater via laundering of clothes avagyan et al 2015 luongo et al 2016 bt uvs observed in sediment and water samples collected from rivers in japan 3 4 117 ng g kameda et al 2011 and china 0 08 4 ng l estimated from graphs zhao et al 2017 implicated wastewater discharged into the rivers as a bt uv source also peng et al 2017 suggested that relatively high concentrations 14 22 ng g of the uv absorber 2 ethylhexyl 4 methoxycinnamate observed at sites not proximate to sewer outfalls in a chinese river could be a result of illegal discharges of untreated wastewater along the river here we use caffeine a common indicator for wastewater contamination in aquatic systems henderson et al 2020 sauvé et al 2012 to assess the possibility of wastewater seeping or overflowing into the creek during extreme wet weather events wet and dry atmospheric deposition to the watershed has also been suggested as a source of bt uvs to rivers and lakes where bt uvs were detected but which received no domestic or industrial wastewater input kameda et al 2011 bt uvs have been detected in particulate matter from outdoor air in industrialized areas maceira et al 2019 similar to mimico creek watershed which has a high number of plastics manufacturing and distribution sites scavenging and washout from the atmosphere during precipitation has been found for other organic compounds with similar properties to bt uvs including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls lei and wania 2004 offenberg and baker 2002 and is also plausible for bt uvs in mimico creek watershed a secondary objective of this study was to better understand dissolved phase particle phase partitioning transport dynamics and the influence of land use on bt uv concentrations during runoff events stormwater is a well documented transport pathway for contaminants into aquatic systems codling et al 2020 masoner et al 2019 but studies addressing the transport dynamics of bt uvs during runoff events are rare parajulee et al 2018 peter et al 2020 furthermore because bt uvs are hydrophobic compounds and are predisposed to sorbing to particles most studies on bt uvs in surface water tend to involve the analysis of the particle phase alone parajulee et al 2018 or unfiltered water samples lu et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 kameda et al 2011 and zhang et al 2015 analyzed for bt uvs in the dissolved fraction of surface water and in stream sediments but not suspended sediments here we analyze for bt uvs in both the dissolved and suspended particle phases of baseflow and stormflow samples collected from mimico creek and little rouge creek another watershed in toronto which drains a rural landscape this study presents a holistic view of bt uv transport in the dissolved and particle phases of surface water during a rainfall event and the likely sources which lead to bt uv enrichment in urban streams 2

minute at the sampling sites were also analyzed duplicate samples collected at the rouge sites were analyzed as well average recoveries of surrogate bt uvs for dissolved and particle phase extractions

supporting information tables s1 s4 all reported concentrations are blank and recovery corrected 2 4 calculations statistical analyses were performed using originpro 2021 version 9 8 0 200 learning edition these include regressions and a hierarchical cluster analysis the cluster analysis was performed using group averages as the cluster method and squared euclidean distances a significance level of α 0 05 was used to determine statistical significance values below the detection limit were substituted with half of the detection limit for each compound for the calculation of averages and loads

dissolved and particle phase respectively average frequencies were generally greater in samples collected from mimico the more urbanized site 21 94 vs 0 84 at rouge uv327 and uv329 were least frequently detected in the dissolved and particle phases respectively while uv328 was most frequently detected in both phases in terms of concentration uvp and uv326 dominated the dissolved phase while the particle phase was mostly composed of uv328 figs 4 s5 using time weighted averages of organic carbon fraction f oc combined with time weighted average concentrations in water and on suspended solids ss we calculated the field derived logarithm of the organic carbon water partitioning ratio log k oc at sites where a particular bt uv could be detected in both phases time weighted averages were employed in this case due to the fact that not many paired water and ss samples had detectable bt uv concentrations log k oc values calculated from the average of individually paired water and ss samples are shown in table s5 a comparison of our measured values with log k oc and log k ow predicted using poly parameter linear free energy relationships goss 2005 nguyen et al 2005 which were fed with predicted solute descriptors ulrich et al 2017 is shown in fig 2 strong but non significant correlations were observed at mol r2 0 86 and 0 89 p 0 05 log k oc values calculated from the concentrations measured in the rouge were considerably lower than those in mimico and correlated poorly with the predicted values fig 2 measured log k oc for bt uvs have rarely been reported because bt uvs often could not be detected in one of the two compartments díaz cruz et al 2019 lu et al 2016 whereas our measured values for uv234 5 2 5 6 table s5 were higher than the values calculated in another southern ontario watershed lu et al 2016 both studies observed a higher log k oc at the urban sites than at rural sites generally field derived log k oc for the bt uvs are lower than might be expected based on predicted log k oc and log k ow values for these compounds i e the concentrations in the dissolved phase were often higher than one might expect one potential explanation would be the sorption of bt uvs to dissolved organic matter that can pass the particle filter 0 7 μm used in this study furthermore the target bt uvs have pk a values ranging from 8 2 to 9 5 table s5 carpinteiro et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 making them weak acids the average ph of the water samples was 8 1 at mimico and 8 2 at rouge see table s2 for all ph data these values indicate that the bt uvs can exist in dissociated form especially for uvp whose pk a is closest and sometimes lower than the ph values such dissociations could result in lower concentrations of the neutral form of the compound in either phase leading to discrepancies between field derived log k oc and predicted log k oc 3 2 spatial differences within and between watersheds no obvious spatial trends were observed in time weighted average concentrations of bt uvs in the dissolved and particle phases of samples collected from mimico fig 3a while the dissolved phase had higher concentrations at mhw and the particle phase had higher concentrations at mmd both phases had nearly equal concentrations at mol in rouge samples dissolved phase concentrations were consistently higher than particle phase concentrations fig 3a the same trend is observed at both sites when calculated on a flow weighted basis fig s4 flow weighted average concentrations were similar to time weighted averages at most sites in both phases with the exception of mol overall total concentrations in mimico were 2 6 times higher than in rouge time weighted average ss concentrations ranged from 17 85 mg l at mhw and mol and 32 100 mg l in rouge reflecting similar ss loadings at both watersheds with the exception of mmd where copious amounts of visually observed sand likely from the creek bed resulted in high ss of 2000 mg l fig 3a when normalized by sub watershed area which comprises the entire area upstream of a sampling point bt uv fluxes in both phases were highest at the mimico outlet mol and were 7 times the highest flux at rouge rmd fig 3b higher urban vs rural stream concentrations for bt uvs have been reported in china peng et al 2017 and in the same watersheds studied here parajulee et al 2018 attributable to higher anthropogenic activity and less permeability in urban areas in comparison with the previous study on particle bound bt uvs in these same watersheds we observed particle bound bt uvs concentrations that are 3 6 and 2 75 times lower in mimico and rouge respectively one reason for this could be the differences in seasonal and event characteristics the two weeks preceding our sample collection in august 2018 had significantly more rainfall average 41 mm than in the previous study 3 and 19 mm the drier antecedent period in 2014 and 2015 was interpreted as more bt uv contaminated particles being built up on surfaces and subsequently washed off resulting in higher bt uv concentrations in mimico and rouge parajulee et al 2018 sample collection and extraction methodologies were similar between this study and parajulee et al 2018 differences apart from the rain events include the analysis of dissolved phase samples in this study and the use of labelled bt uvs which were unavailable during the previous study as surrogates 3 3 temporal patterns during the runoff event in order to provide insight into transport dynamics fig 4 shows the distribution between the dissolved and particle phases across the rainfall event for uvp and uv328 plots for uv326 and uv234 which showed some values below and some above the detection limit are displayed in fig s5 concentrations of uv327 and uv329 were generally observed below the limit of detection or not at all and are not included in this discussion all data including duplicate values which are averaged in figs 4 and s5 are included in the si tables s2 and s3 in mimico figs 4a and s5a the dominance of the dissolved phase blue bars for the less hydrophobic uvp and uv326 and of particles yellow bars for the more hydrophobic uv328 and uv234 is immediately apparent especially at mmd and mol increased particle phase concentrations of uvp and uv326 log k ow 3 6 and 6 1 respectively ulrich et al 2017 at peak stream discharge and ss concentrations indicate that at high flow there is an influx of particle bound compounds to the creek this is similarly the case for uv328 and uv234 for which high particle phase concentrations dwarf dissolved phase concentrations they have a higher affinity for the particle phase because of high hydrophobicity log k ow 8 2 and 8 6 respectively ulrich et al 2017 total bt uv concentrations in mimico were in the order of uv328 uvp uv 326 uv234 in the rouge watershed total bt uv concentrations were lower especially for uv328 figs 4b and s5b this is entirely due to lower particle phase concentrations in fact time weighted average dissolved phase concentrations of uv328 at all mimico and rouge sites only range between 0 1 and 0 8 ng l the presence and enrichment of uv328 in this system is thus predominantly a result of contaminated particle transport uvp 2 4 3 8 ng l and uv234 0 04 0 2 ng l also show similar time weighted average dissolved phase concentrations across all sites with the exception of uvp at rol 0 25 ng l pronounced differences in dissolved phase concentrations were observed only for uv326 while time weighted average dissolved concentrations for uv326 in mimico range from 3 7 to 10 2 ng l they only go up to 1 7 ng l in rouge notwithstanding the lower concentrations in rouge compared to mimico the same trend of higher particle phase concentrations at peak flow is also observed here especially for uv328 and uv234 among the bt uvs uvp had the highest total concentrations in rouge followed by uv328 the temporal patterns of bt uvs in mimico and rouge are similar regardless of the concentration gradient freely dissolved bt uvs especially uvp and uv326 dominated base flow samples and were either slightly enriched mol rmd diluted mmd rhw or showed no decipherable changes mhw rol at high flow this divergent behaviour of dissolved phase bt uvs coupled with the relatively constant concentrations at both watersheds suggests that there is no significant input of freely dissolved bt uvs during the rainfall event the exception to this is uv326 whose time weighted dissolved concentrations in mimico were about 6 times higher than in rouge suggesting a prominent source of this compound in the mimico watershed this is similar to the observation of relatively high concentrations of uv326 in urban creek water in southern ontario lu et al 2016 analysis of baseflow and stormflow water samples from an urban creek in washington state usa also showed more enrichment of uv326 at high flow peter et al 2020 whereas both studies above analyzed unfiltered water samples the absence of similarly high uv326 concentrations in sediment lu et al 2016 and the dilution observed for uv234 analyzed along with uv326 peter et al 2020 suggest that uv326 is transported predominantly in the dissolved phase because bt uv levels are dependent on location specific use and can vary spatially kameda et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 perhaps the best comparison is with a study conducted within the same watersheds parajulee et al found uv326 to contribute slightly more to the bt uvs in ss in rouge 7 than in mimico 5 parajulee et al 2018 similar contributions are observed in ss in this study 10 in rouge and 6 in mimico however when dissolved phase concentrations are included uv326 contributes 36 of the total bt uvs in mimico and only 12 in rouge it follows that the dissolved phase can sometimes be the dominant partitioning phase for bt uvs notwithstanding their high k ow values and should be included in studies to avoid underestimating bt uv levels in environmental samples particle transport is the major entry route of bt uvs to surface water during rainfall events in both mimico and rouge watersheds higher particle phase concentrations are observed at high flows which mostly coincide with high ss loads correlations between bt uv and ss have been observed elsewhere langford et al 2015 parajulee et al 2018 reflecting particle transport of bt uvs uv328 and uv234 were detected predominantly in the particle phase corresponding to them having the highest log k ow values of the target compounds similar observations have been made in landfill leachate langford et al 2015 and surface water kameda et al 2011 particle concentrations of uv328 and uv234 were strongly and significantly correlated with each other r2 0 84 p 0 0001 uv328 was also significantly correlated with uv326 r2 0 87 and uv327 r2 0 73 and uv234 with uv326 r2 0 83 and uv327 r2 0 79 p 0 0001 in all cases such particle phase correlations are consistent with observations for these compounds in similar studies kameda et al 2011 lu et al 2016 nakata et al 2009 and are indicative of similar sources and transport mechanisms in the particle phase the observation of peak particle phase concentrations at peak flow at most sites shows that contaminated particles are rapidly transported into the stream during the event the particle bound first flush at mmd and to a lower extent at mol i e peak in particle phase bt uv concentration prior to peak flow additionally suggests that there is a wash off of contaminated particles that are readily available and that the dynamics of bt uv transport at these sampling points differ from the others likely sources are discussed further below 3 4 source elucidation of bt uvs to mimico creek even though the particulate bt uv concentrations measured in mimico here 2 113 ng g expressed in ng g for ease of comparison are lower than previously reported for mimico parajulee et al 2018 they are still on par with levels in rivers heavily polluted by domestic and industrial wastewater 2 117 ng g kameda et al 2011 in the following paragraphs we explore the various hypotheses formulated in the introduction as to the source of these bt uvs based on the collected evidence 3 4 1 unregulated wastewater seepage uvp uv326 uv328 and uv234 were the dominant congeners in laundry water fig s1 in line with the same compounds except uvp which was not considered in the study being ubiquitous in wastewater influent collected from canadian wwtps lu et al 2017 laundry water thus appears to be a suitable proxy for untreated wastewater the large fraction of uv234 in laundry water is consistent with its use as an additive for applications of high surface area such as films and fibers mayzo inc 2020 bt uv concentrations measured in the wastewater effluent were lower than in laundry water for all analytes except uvp uv327 and uv329 however concentrations in both the laundry water and wwtp effluent were greater than average concentrations in the stream even though the same congeners were dominant in mimico creek water ww effluent and laundry water a hierarchical cluster analysis between average bt uv concentrations at each site laundry water and wastewater effluent using fractions of each congener in each sample indicated that total bt uv compositions in stream water samples are very similar to each other but different from ww effluent and laundry water fig 5a the concentrations of the sewage tracer caffeine in stream water did not change appreciably as the event progressed fig 5b this is in contrast to bt uvs in mimico creek water which generally were enriched at high streamflow figs 4a s5a both these observations suggest that unregulated seepage of wastewater treated or otherwise is not likely to be responsible for the high bt uv concentrations observed in mimico creek having eliminated unregulated wastewater input as a source to mimico it is evident that non wastewater sources can deliver amounts of bt uvs to surface water in amounts that are comparable to those found in wastewater impacted systems kameda et al 2011 3 4 2 atmospheric watershed deposition the concentration and composition of bt uvs in rainwater were very similar in the two watersheds in both mimico and rouge uvp and uv328 were dominant and the rain falling at the headwater site was about twice as contaminated with bt uvs than the rain at the outlet sites fig 6a one difference between watersheds was that bt uvs were present in approximately equal abundance in dissolved and particle phase in rain falling at mimico while rain in the rouge watershed was more dominated by bt uvs in the sorbed phase fig 6a this was because more particles were washed out at the rouge sites 26 75 mg l vs 0 4 6 9 mg l at mimico and not because the particles were more contaminated the dominance of uvp and uv328 in rainwater provides some insight into stream concentrations at high flow at both mimico and rouge these compounds were enriched in both phases at high flow especially at mmd mol and rmd suggesting that atmospheric watershed deposition is a plausible entry route to the streams fig 4 at rouge uvp and uv328 also contribute the highest fractions in the stream a hierarchical cluster analysis for rainwater and stream water further links the stream bt uv profile to the rainwater profile and implicates atmospheric watershed deposition as a source of bt uvs to rhw and rmd fig s2 comparing bt uv mass loads in rainwater and stream water suggests that the mass of bt uvs washed out from the atmosphere would be sufficient to explain the mass of bt uvs recorded in the stream water collected in the rouge and in the headwater catchment of mimico fig 6b however the stream mass load of bt uvs at the mimico outlet is more than an order of magnitude higher than the mass we estimate to have been deposited to the mimico watershed with the rain furthermore the dominant congener in mimico creek water is uv328 and not uvp as in the rainwater these discrepancies and higher bt uv concentrations in mimico stream water compared to rouge cannot be explained by wet atmospheric deposition alone suggesting that the area draining at mol is supplied with bt uv by sources other than or in addition to wet atmospheric deposition 3 4 3 plastic debris and pre production pellets uv stabilizers are typically added to plastics in amounts ranging from 0 05 3 w w hahladakis et al 2018 the majority of plastic items analyzed had bt uv concentrations lower than would be expected if these compounds were incorporated as additives during production only in four items the outer white shell of two golf balls artificial grass and a traffic cone id 21 24 table s4 were concentrations high enough to suggest that they contain bt uvs as additives and are potential sources of these compounds to the environment fig 7a uv328 was most abundant in the golf balls and the traffic cone with concentrations ranging from 136 729 μg g corresponding to 0 02 0 07 of uv328 by weight of the plastic uvp and uv234 were detected in the traffic cone and artificial grass at similar concentrations of 21 and 20 μg g respectively considerably lower than uv328 but still high enough to suggest their addition as light stabilizers uvp uv328 and uv234 are the bt uvs that were found to be ubiquitous in ss from mimico creek in this and an earlier parajulee et al 2018 study providing credence to the possibility that items such as these are a source of bt uvs to the creek especially the golf balls the mimico watershed has three golf courses in the vicinity of the mmd and mol sampling sites from which both golf balls analyzed here were collected uv328 which is dominant in the golf balls also contributes the highest fraction of particle phase bt uvs to mimico creek water it follows that the many golf balls in mimico creek may indeed be leaching their bt uv additives into the creek water the measured concentration of about 0 02 of uv328 by weight of the golf ball polymer falls short of the typical amount of uv stabilizers added to plastics and could be a result of additives having leached out into the surrounding environment although we did not analyze new golf balls to confirm or refute this the study of plastic debris and new products by rani et al 2017 showed that discarded plastic debris can contain over 50 less additives than their new counterparts the presence of golf balls however does not explain the enrichment in uv328 observed at high streamflow in mimico single use plastic bags and tarps were the most frequently observed type of debris in the mimico watershed plastic bags are widely used by consumers on a daily basis creating a significant amount of waste and prompting bans on their use the canadian government aims to ban single use plastic including plastic bags and achieve zero plastic waste by 2030 environment and climate change canada 2021 while these items gave no indication of containing bt uv additives the composition of bt uvs observed in them were very similar to those observed in the creek uvp uv326 and uv328 were most abundant in these items mirroring creek water composition fig 7b excluding the four items described above the plastic bags and tarps had the highest bt uv concentrations 0 2 1 1 μg g among the plastic debris table s4 plastic bags and tarps are generally composed of polyethylene which has a high sorption capacity alimi et al 2018 and has even been used as a passive sampler to measure organic compounds in the environment fries et al 2012 khairy et al 2014 the variable bt uv amounts on these plastic bags along with the similar compositions indicate that sorption of bt uvs from the environment onto these items is likely occurring given that we had no way of ascertaining when each item was discarded at the creek it is possible that items that had been discarded for longer periods are the ones with higher concentrations of adsorbed bt uvs bt uvs were largely absent in the pre production pellets and fibers table s4 the highest observed concentration was for uvp in nylon fibers 0 3 μg g these low concentrations may suggest that the addition of bt uvs occurs at a later manufacturing stage khanam and almaadeed 2015 and do not necessarily rule out pre production pellets as viable sources of bt uvs to mimico concentrations of industrial pellets and fragments of up to 43 particles per m3 were observed in samples predominantly wet weather samples from mimico creek indicating that stormwater indeed transports such items from nearby plastic industries tsui et al 2020 3 4 4 flushing of particles accumulating on surfaces none of the three hypothesized sources is likely to be fully responsible for the high bt uvs levels measured in mimico creek however the measurements provide some new hints about the characteristics of the source of bt uvs the enrichment of bt uvs in mimico creek during the event fig 4a s5a is predominantly due to an influx of contaminated particles particle bound bt uv first flushes observed especially in mmd and in mol for uv328 and uv234 further point to the washing off of surfaces on which bt uv particles have built up both of these effects occur to a lower extent at the rouge watershed consistent with the increased natural land cover and infiltration in rouge of the three sampling campaigns that have been undertaken at mimico for bt uvs parajulee et al 2018 and this study the highest concentrations were observed in november 2014 a period when the topsoil was likely frozen due to sub zero temperatures and which had the driest antecedent period preceding the rain event while the lowest concentrations were found in this study undertaken during a wet summer period there is evidently a relationship between bt uv stream water concentrations and the existence of environmental factors which promote increased overland particle wash off during the drier antecedent period in 2014 more bt uv contaminated particles repeatedly accumulated on surrounding impervious surfaces and were readily available for wash off into the creek when the rain event finally occurred the use of uv328 in automotive coatings and paints in canada environment and climate change canada 2016 provides a plausible source of this contaminated particle buildup as of 2013 10 000 to 100 000 kg of uv328 was imported into canada annually not including the amount present in finished articles environment and climate change canada 2016 and 37 of uv328 in canada is used in the automobile industry mimico creek watershed contains major highways and road networks and has a population of over 110 000 people toronto and region conservation authority 2020 corresponding to at least 1600 people km2 such a dense urbanized region is likely to have a lot of vehicles personal and public and thus more uv328 containing materials paint chippings from cars have previously been shown to contribute to road surface buildup of heavy metal contaminants deletic and orr 2005 and contaminants on road surfaces are easily transported into surface water during wet weather as is evidenced by the detection of tire and road wear particles in stormwater samples grbić et al 2020 in addition road dust samples from mimico creek watershed analyzed for bt uvs contained up to 88 of uv328 parajulee et al 2018 although the composition of the road dust was not investigated again here the high fraction of uv328 and the absence of uvp which is not known to be used in automotive applications in canada in these samples suggests that vehicle paint chippings may very well be a major component since bt uv profiles within a given region are similar a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using the road dust samples from parajulee et al 2018 golf balls stream water ss samples and rainwater ss samples from this study fig s3 the close clustering of mol stormflow samples with road dust and rainwater and baseflow samples with golf balls support the elucidation above samples at mhw and mmd however displayed no obvious clusters from which inferences could be drawn in addition to uv328 our results indicate that uvp uv326 and uv234 are most ubiquitous in ontario consistent with other studies in this region lu et al 2016 parajulee et al 2018 4 conclusion bt uvs which are hydrophobic compounds are shown here to sometimes be transported in the freely dissolved phase in aquatic systems uv326 which has a predicted log k ow of 6 1 was found to be predominantly transported in the dissolved phase during a rainfall event studies of bt uvs in aquatic environmental systems should consider both partitioning phases to prevent underestimations whereas bt uv compositions are consistent in similar regions actual concentrations can be influenced by seasonal and event characteristics in urban and rural areas bt uvs have similar transport mechanisms but variable concentrations which correspond to differences in emissions and land use in these areas the rapid transport of accumulated bt uv contaminated particles to surface water is a major entry route for bt uvs although wastewater is an important vector for bt uv transport we assert that these other possible routes need to be evaluated as they could be delivering comparable or higher amounts of bt uvs we also show that informal disposal of plastic debris can provide both sources and sinks of bt uvs in aquatic systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

environment given their wide use as additives in consumer products their bio accumulative and toxic properties are increasingly being scrutinised evinced by the recent proposition to add uv328 to the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants here we measured concentrations of six bt uvs in the dissolved and particulate phases of stream water collected from an urban and rural stream during a runoff event under baseflow conditions the less hydrophobic bt uvs were present at low concentrations in the dissolved phase while much higher loads of particulate bt uvs occurred during stormflow especially in the urban creek time weighted average bt uv concentrations were up to 4 times higher in the urban than in the rural creek bt uvs were found to be prevalent in water obtained from laundering textiles which plausibly constitutes a major portion of domestic wastewater and can serve as a bt uv source to aquatic waterways however the observed dilution of a sewage tracer during the run off event suggests that unregulated wastewater seepage is not responsible for the high bt uv loads in storm water high levels of uv328 and uv234 were detected in a select few plastic debris items collected from the urban watershed and in artificial turf grass respectively whereas this may allow for the leaching of those bt uvs into the creek most plastic debris is more likely a sink than a source of bt uvs the observed input of particle bound bt uvs at the onset of the rain event indicates that most of the bt uvs reach the creek with contaminated particles that had built up on surfaces during the antecedent dry period uv328 was the dominant bt uv in those particles if such particle build up occurs on road surfaces it may suggest that the use of uv328 in automotive applications contributes to their presence in urban storm water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultraviolet stabilizers plastics urban runoff precipitation 1 introduction due to their ability to absorb the full spectrum of ultraviolet uv light benzotriazole ultraviolet stabilizers bt uvs which have a phenolic group attached to the benzotriazole ring are used in a variety of products particularly those constantly exposed to sunlight this is done to prevent yellowing and degradation that could result from prolonged exposure to uv radiation andrady and rajapakse 2016 such widespread use leads to detectable concentrations of bt uvs in environmental matrices which have been reported for surface water lu et al 2016 sea water montesdeoca esponda et al 2020 sediment cantwell et al 2015 biota lu et al 2019 wastewater song et al 2014 and plastic debris rani et al 2017 the toxic and bio accumulative properties of bt uvs are well documented kim et al 2011 liang et al 2019 and as a result some bt uvs have been classified under the european registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach regulation as substances of very high concern european chemicals agency echa 2014 in canada from as early as 1986 63 of imported uv328 a member of this group has been used in the plastics sector and the rest in automotive paints and coatings environment and climate change canada 2016 analysis of suspended sediment collected from mimico creek located in an urbanized watershed in toronto canada showed relatively high concentrations of bt uvs 13 240 ng g especially uvp uv328 and uv234 parajulee et al 2018 whereas wastewater has been shown to be a vector of bt uvs into aquatic environments lu et al 2017 mimico creek receives no direct wastewater effluent suggesting the presence of an alternate source of bt uvs one objective of this study was to elucidate the sources of bt uvs to mimico creek and thereby also to urban surface waters elsewhere the three possible sources of bt uvs being considered include plastics unregulated wastewater input and atmospheric washout plastics in the environment are broadly divided into macro plastics 5 mm and microplastics 5 mm hahladakis et al 2018 microplastics can further be classified as primary and secondary the former are specifically manufactured in the 5 mm range and include pre production pellets and microbeads used in personal care products horton et al 2017 napper et al 2015 whereas the latter are formed from the fragmentation of larger plastic pieces upon entering the environment barnes et al 2009 thompson 2004 manufactured plastic materials often contain a wide range of additives i e chemical compounds added to improve the performance functionality and ageing properties of the polymer hahladakis et al 2018 these include uv stabilizers which are typically added to consumer products at concentrations of 0 05 3 by weight of the polymer and in most cases are not chemically bound to the plastic polymer increasing their potential to leach out of the plastic hahladakis et al 2018 the presence of additive containing plastics could over time result in weathering induced migration of these chemicals into the surrounding environment as has been observed previously for bt uvs gao et al 2011 hahladakis et al 2018 plastic particles in aquatic systems could further act as vectors for the transport of pollutants mato et al 2001 considering the widespread occurrence of plastic debris and the presence of plastic manufacturing and distribution industries in the mimico creek watershed we hypothesized that the informal disposal of consumer plastics and industrial pre production pellets could play a role in the bt uv contamination of the creek the use of bt uvs in textiles and

in japan 3 4 117 ng g kameda et al 2011 and china 0 08 4 ng l estimated from graphs zhao et al 2017 implicated wastewater discharged into the rivers as a bt uv source also peng et al 2017 suggested that relatively high concentrations 14 22 ng g of the uv absorber 2 ethylhexyl 4 methoxycinnamate observed at sites not proximate to sewer outfalls in a chinese river could be a result of illegal discharges of untreated wastewater along the river here we use caffeine a common indicator for wastewater contamination in aquatic systems henderson et al 2020 sauvé et al 2012 to assess the possibility of wastewater seeping or overflowing into the creek during extreme wet weather events wet and dry atmospheric deposition to the watershed has also been suggested as a source of bt uvs to rivers and lakes where bt uvs were detected but which received no domestic or industrial wastewater input kameda et al 2011 bt uvs have been detected in particulate matter from outdoor air in industrialized areas maceira et al 2019 similar to mimico creek watershed which has a high number of plastics manufacturing and distribution sites scavenging and washout from the atmosphere during precipitation has been found for other organic compounds with similar properties to bt uvs including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls lei and wania 2004 offenberg and baker 2002 and is also plausible for bt uvs in mimico creek watershed a secondary objective of this study was to better understand dissolved phase particle phase partitioning transport dynamics and the influence of land use on bt uv concentrations during runoff events stormwater is a well documented transport pathway for contaminants into aquatic systems codling et al 2020 masoner et al 2019 but studies addressing the transport dynamics of bt uvs during runoff events are rare parajulee et al 2018 peter et al 2020 furthermore because bt uvs are hydrophobic compounds and are predisposed to sorbing to particles most studies on bt uvs in surface water tend to involve the analysis of the particle phase alone parajulee et al 2018 or unfiltered water samples lu et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 kameda et al 2011 and zhang et al 2015 analyzed for bt uvs in the dissolved fraction of surface water and in stream sediments but not suspended sediments here we analyze for bt uvs in both the dissolved and suspended particle phases of baseflow and stormflow samples collected from mimico creek and little rouge creek another watershed in toronto which drains a rural landscape this study presents a holistic view of bt uv transport in the dissolved and particle phases of surface water during a rainfall event and the likely sources which lead to bt uv enrichment in urban streams 2 methods 2 1 sampling mimico creek watershed mimico 68 km2 located in the greater toronto area gta in canada on the western edge of the city of toronto is highly urbanized and contains roads highways golf courses industrial and residential areas and part of a major airport little rouge creek watershed rouge 111 km2 on the eastern edge of toronto has a less developed landscape which is covered mostly by agricultural land 70 and some suburban development in the south fig 1 both creeks drain into lake ontario and receive no direct input of effluent from wastewater treatment plants or manufacturing industries samples of baseflow and stormflow were taken during a summer storm event in august 2018 at a headwater hw drainage point near the middle md and near the outlet ol of both

dissolved and particle phase respectively average frequencies were generally greater in samples collected from mimico the more urbanized site 21 94 vs 0 84 at rouge uv327 and uv329 were least frequently detected in the dissolved and particle phases respectively while uv328 was most frequently detected in both phases in terms of concentration uvp and uv326 dominated the dissolved phase while the particle phase was mostly composed of uv328 figs 4 s5 using time weighted averages of organic carbon fraction f oc combined with time weighted average concentrations in water and on suspended solids ss we calculated the field derived logarithm of the organic carbon water partitioning ratio log k oc at sites where a particular bt uv could be detected in both phases time weighted averages were employed in this case due to the fact that not many paired water and ss samples had detectable bt uv concentrations log k oc values calculated from the average of individually paired water and ss samples are shown in table s5 a comparison of our measured values with log k oc and log k ow predicted using poly parameter linear free energy relationships goss 2005 nguyen et al 2005 which were fed with predicted solute descriptors ulrich et al 2017 is shown in fig 2 strong but non significant correlations were observed at mol r2 0 86 and 0 89 p 0 05 log k oc values calculated from the concentrations measured in the rouge were considerably lower than those in mimico and correlated poorly with the predicted values fig 2 measured log k oc for bt uvs have rarely been reported because bt uvs often could not be detected in one of the two compartments díaz cruz et al 2019 lu et al 2016 whereas our measured values for uv234 5 2 5 6 table s5 were higher than the values calculated in another southern ontario watershed lu et al 2016 both studies observed a higher log k oc at the urban sites than at rural sites generally field derived log k oc for the bt uvs are lower than might be expected based on predicted log k oc and log k ow values for these compounds i e the concentrations in the dissolved phase were often higher than one might expect one potential explanation would be the sorption of bt uvs to dissolved organic matter that can pass the particle filter 0 7 μm used in this study furthermore the target bt uvs have pk a values ranging from 8 2 to 9 5 table s5 carpinteiro et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 making them weak acids the average ph of the water samples was 8 1 at mimico and 8 2 at rouge see table s2 for all ph data these values indicate that the bt uvs can exist in dissociated form especially for uvp whose pk a is closest and sometimes lower than the ph values such dissociations could result in lower concentrations of the neutral form of the compound in either phase leading to discrepancies between field derived log k oc and predicted log k oc 3 2 spatial differences within and between watersheds no obvious spatial trends were observed in time weighted average concentrations of bt uvs in the dissolved and particle phases of samples collected from mimico fig 3a while the dissolved phase had higher concentrations at mhw and the particle phase had higher concentrations at mmd both phases had nearly equal concentrations at mol in rouge samples dissolved phase concentrations were consistently higher than particle phase concentrations fig 3a the same trend is observed at both sites when calculated on a flow weighted basis fig s4 flow weighted average concentrations were similar to time weighted averages at most sites in both phases with the exception of mol overall total concentrations in mimico were 2 6 times higher than in rouge time weighted average ss concentrations ranged from 17 85 mg l at mhw and mol and 32 100 mg l in rouge reflecting similar ss loadings at both watersheds with the exception of mmd where copious amounts of visually observed sand likely from the creek bed resulted in high ss of 2000 mg l fig 3a when normalized by sub watershed area which comprises the entire area upstream of a sampling point bt uv fluxes in both phases were highest at the mimico outlet mol and were 7 times the highest flux at rouge rmd fig 3b higher urban vs rural stream concentrations for bt uvs have been reported in china peng et al 2017 and in the same watersheds studied here parajulee et al 2018 attributable to higher anthropogenic activity and less permeability in urban areas in comparison with the previous study on particle bound bt uvs in these same watersheds we observed particle bound bt uvs concentrations that are 3 6 and 2 75 times lower in mimico and rouge respectively one reason for this could be the differences in seasonal and event characteristics the two weeks preceding our sample collection in august 2018 had significantly more rainfall average 41 mm than in the previous study 3 and 19 mm the drier antecedent period in 2014 and 2015 was interpreted as more bt uv contaminated particles being built up on surfaces and subsequently washed off resulting in higher bt uv concentrations in mimico and rouge parajulee et al 2018 sample collection and extraction methodologies were similar between this study and parajulee et al 2018 differences apart from the rain events include the analysis of dissolved phase samples in this study and the use of labelled bt uvs which were unavailable during the previous study as surrogates 3 3 temporal patterns during the runoff event in order to provide insight into transport dynamics fig 4 shows the distribution between the dissolved and particle phases across the rainfall event for uvp and uv328 plots for uv326 and uv234 which showed some values below and some above the detection limit are displayed in fig s5 concentrations of uv327 and uv329 were generally observed below the limit of detection or not at all and are not included in this discussion all data including duplicate values which are averaged in figs 4 and s5 are included in the si tables s2 and s3 in mimico figs 4a and s5a the dominance of the dissolved phase blue bars for the less hydrophobic uvp and uv326 and of particles yellow bars for the more hydrophobic uv328 and uv234 is immediately apparent especially at mmd and mol increased particle phase concentrations of uvp and uv326 log k ow 3 6 and 6 1 respectively ulrich et al 2017 at peak stream discharge and ss concentrations indicate that at high flow there is an influx of particle bound compounds to the creek this is similarly the case for uv328 and uv234 for which high particle phase concentrations dwarf dissolved phase concentrations they have a higher affinity for the particle phase because of high hydrophobicity log k ow 8 2 and 8 6 respectively ulrich et al 2017 total bt uv concentrations in mimico were in the order of uv328 uvp uv 326 uv234 in the rouge watershed total bt uv concentrations were lower especially for uv328 figs 4b and s5b this is entirely due to lower particle phase concentrations in fact time weighted average dissolved phase concentrations of uv328 at all mimico and rouge sites only range between 0 1 and 0 8 ng l the presence and enrichment of uv328 in this system is thus predominantly a result of contaminated particle transport uvp 2 4 3 8 ng l and uv234 0 04 0 2 ng l also show similar time weighted average dissolved phase concentrations across all sites with the exception of uvp at rol 0 25 ng l pronounced differences in dissolved phase concentrations were observed only for uv326 while time weighted average dissolved concentrations for uv326 in mimico range from 3 7 to 10 2 ng l they only go up to 1 7 ng l in rouge notwithstanding the lower concentrations in rouge compared to mimico the same trend of higher particle phase concentrations at peak flow is also observed here especially for uv328 and uv234 among the bt uvs uvp had the highest total concentrations in rouge followed by uv328 the temporal patterns of bt uvs in mimico and rouge are similar regardless of the concentration gradient freely dissolved bt uvs especially uvp and uv326 dominated base flow samples and were either slightly enriched mol rmd diluted mmd rhw or showed no decipherable changes mhw rol at high flow this divergent behaviour of dissolved phase bt uvs coupled with the relatively constant concentrations at both watersheds suggests that there is no significant input of freely dissolved bt uvs during the rainfall event the exception to this is uv326 whose time weighted dissolved concentrations in mimico were about 6 times higher than in rouge suggesting a prominent source of this compound in the mimico watershed this is similar to the observation of relatively high concentrations of uv326 in urban creek water in southern ontario lu et al 2016 analysis of baseflow and stormflow water samples from an urban creek in washington state usa also showed more enrichment of uv326 at high flow peter et al 2020 whereas both studies above analyzed unfiltered water samples the absence of similarly high uv326 concentrations in sediment lu et al 2016 and the dilution observed for uv234 analyzed along with uv326 peter et al 2020 suggest that uv326 is transported predominantly in the dissolved phase because bt uv levels are dependent on location specific use and can vary spatially kameda et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 perhaps the best comparison is with a study conducted within the same watersheds parajulee et al found uv326 to contribute slightly more to the bt uvs in ss in rouge 7 than in mimico 5 parajulee et al 2018 similar contributions are observed in ss in this study 10 in rouge and 6 in mimico however when dissolved phase concentrations are included uv326 contributes 36 of the total bt uvs in mimico and only 12 in rouge it follows that the dissolved phase can sometimes be the dominant partitioning phase for bt uvs notwithstanding their high k ow values and should be included in studies to avoid underestimating bt uv levels in environmental samples particle transport is the major entry route of bt uvs to surface water during rainfall events in both mimico and rouge watersheds higher particle phase concentrations are observed at high flows which mostly coincide with high ss loads correlations between bt uv and ss have been observed elsewhere langford et al 2015 parajulee et al 2018 reflecting particle transport of bt uvs uv328 and uv234 were detected predominantly in the particle phase corresponding to them having the highest log k ow values of the target compounds similar observations have been made in landfill leachate langford et al 2015 and surface water kameda et al 2011 particle concentrations of uv328 and uv234 were strongly and significantly correlated with each other r2 0 84 p 0 0001 uv328 was also significantly correlated with uv326 r2 0 87 and uv327 r2 0 73 and uv234 with uv326 r2 0 83 and uv327 r2 0 79 p 0 0001 in all cases such particle phase correlations are consistent with observations for these compounds in similar studies kameda et al 2011 lu et al 2016 nakata et al 2009 and are indicative of similar sources and transport mechanisms in the particle phase the observation of peak particle phase concentrations at peak flow at most sites shows that contaminated particles are rapidly transported into the stream during the event the particle bound first flush at mmd and to a lower extent at mol i e peak in particle phase bt uv concentration prior to peak flow additionally suggests that there is a wash off of contaminated particles that are readily available and that the dynamics of bt uv transport at these sampling points differ from the others likely sources are discussed further below 3 4 source elucidation of bt uvs to mimico creek even though the particulate bt uv concentrations measured in mimico here 2 113 ng g expressed in ng g for ease of comparison are lower than previously reported for mimico parajulee et al 2018 they are still on par with levels in rivers heavily polluted by domestic and industrial wastewater 2 117 ng g kameda et al 2011 in the following paragraphs we explore the various hypotheses formulated in the introduction as to the source of these bt uvs based on the collected evidence 3 4 1 unregulated wastewater seepage uvp uv326 uv328 and uv234 were the dominant congeners in laundry water fig s1 in line with the same compounds except uvp which was not considered in the study being ubiquitous in wastewater influent collected from canadian wwtps lu et al 2017 laundry water thus appears to be a suitable proxy for untreated wastewater the large fraction of uv234 in laundry water is consistent with its use as an additive for applications of high surface area such as films and fibers mayzo inc 2020 bt uv concentrations measured in the wastewater effluent were lower than in laundry water for all analytes except uvp uv327 and uv329 however concentrations in both the laundry water and wwtp effluent were greater than average concentrations in the stream even though the same congeners were dominant in mimico creek water ww effluent and laundry water a hierarchical cluster analysis between average bt uv concentrations at each site laundry water and wastewater effluent using fractions of each congener in each sample indicated that total bt uv compositions in stream water samples are very similar to each other but different from ww effluent and laundry water fig 5a the concentrations of the sewage tracer caffeine in stream water did not change appreciably as the event progressed fig 5b this is in contrast to bt uvs in mimico creek water which generally were enriched at high streamflow figs 4a s5a both these observations suggest that unregulated seepage of wastewater treated or otherwise is not likely to be responsible for the high bt uv concentrations observed in mimico creek having eliminated unregulated wastewater input as a source to mimico it is evident that non wastewater sources can deliver amounts of bt uvs to surface water in amounts that are comparable to those found in wastewater impacted systems kameda et al 2011 3 4 2 atmospheric watershed deposition the concentration and composition of bt uvs in rainwater were very similar in the two watersheds in both mimico and rouge uvp and uv328 were dominant and the rain falling at the headwater site was about twice as contaminated with bt uvs than the rain at the outlet sites fig 6a one difference between watersheds was that bt uvs were present in approximately equal abundance in dissolved and particle phase in rain falling at mimico while rain in the rouge watershed was more dominated by bt uvs in the sorbed phase fig 6a this was because more particles were washed out at the rouge sites 26 75 mg l vs 0 4 6 9 mg l at mimico and not because the particles were more contaminated the dominance of uvp and uv328 in rainwater provides some insight into stream concentrations at high flow at both mimico and rouge these compounds were enriched in both phases at high flow especially at mmd mol and rmd suggesting that atmospheric watershed deposition is a plausible entry route to the streams fig 4 at rouge uvp and uv328 also contribute the highest fractions in the stream a hierarchical cluster analysis for rainwater and stream water further links the stream bt uv profile to the rainwater profile and implicates atmospheric watershed deposition as a source of bt uvs to rhw and rmd fig s2 comparing bt uv mass loads in rainwater and stream water suggests that the mass of bt uvs washed out from the atmosphere would be sufficient to explain the mass of bt uvs recorded in the stream water collected in the rouge and in the headwater catchment of mimico fig 6b however the stream mass load of bt uvs at the mimico outlet is more than an order of magnitude higher than the mass we estimate to have been deposited to the mimico watershed with the rain furthermore the dominant congener in mimico creek water is uv328 and not uvp as in the rainwater these discrepancies and higher bt uv concentrations in mimico stream water compared to rouge cannot be explained by wet atmospheric deposition alone suggesting that the area draining at mol is supplied with bt uv by sources other than or in addition to wet atmospheric deposition 3 4 3 plastic debris and pre production pellets uv stabilizers are typically added to plastics in amounts ranging from 0 05 3 w w hahladakis et al 2018 the majority of plastic items analyzed had bt uv concentrations lower than would be expected if these compounds were incorporated as additives during production only in four items the outer white shell of two golf balls artificial grass and a traffic cone id 21 24 table s4 were concentrations high enough to suggest that they contain bt uvs as additives and are potential sources of these compounds to the environment fig 7a uv328 was most abundant in the golf balls and the traffic cone with concentrations ranging from 136 729 μg g corresponding to 0 02 0 07 of uv328 by weight of the plastic uvp and uv234 were detected in the traffic cone and artificial grass at similar concentrations of 21 and 20 μg g respectively considerably lower than uv328 but still high enough to suggest their addition as light stabilizers uvp uv328 and uv234 are the bt uvs that were found to be ubiquitous in ss from mimico creek in this and an earlier parajulee et al 2018 study providing credence to the possibility that items such as these are a source of bt uvs to the creek especially the golf balls the mimico watershed has three golf courses in the vicinity of the mmd and mol sampling sites from which both golf balls analyzed here were collected uv328 which is dominant in the golf balls also contributes the highest fraction of particle phase bt uvs to mimico creek water it follows that the many golf balls in mimico creek may indeed be leaching their bt uv additives into the creek water the measured concentration of about 0 02 of uv328 by weight of the golf ball polymer falls short of the typical amount of uv stabilizers added to plastics and could be a result of additives having leached out into the surrounding environment although we did not analyze new golf balls to confirm or refute this the study of plastic debris and new products by rani et al 2017 showed that discarded plastic debris can contain over 50 less additives than their new counterparts the presence of golf balls however does not explain the enrichment in uv328 observed at high streamflow in mimico single use plastic bags and tarps were the most frequently observed type of debris in the mimico watershed plastic bags are widely used by consumers on a daily basis creating a significant amount of waste and prompting bans on their use the canadian government aims to ban single use plastic including plastic bags and achieve zero plastic waste by 2030 environment and climate change canada 2021 while these items gave no indication of containing bt uv additives the composition of bt uvs observed in them were very similar to those observed in the creek uvp uv326 and uv328 were most abundant in these items mirroring creek water composition fig 7b excluding the four items described above the plastic bags and tarps had the highest bt uv concentrations 0 2 1 1 μg g among the plastic debris table s4 plastic bags and tarps are generally composed of polyethylene which has a high sorption capacity alimi et al 2018 and has even been used as a passive sampler to measure organic compounds in the environment fries et al 2012 khairy et al 2014 the variable bt uv amounts on these plastic bags along with the similar compositions indicate that sorption of bt uvs from the environment onto these items is likely occurring given that we had no way of ascertaining when each item was discarded at the creek it is possible that items that had been discarded for longer periods are the ones with higher concentrations of adsorbed bt uvs bt uvs were largely absent in the pre production pellets and fibers table s4 the highest observed concentration was for uvp in nylon fibers 0 3 μg g these low concentrations may suggest that the addition of bt uvs occurs at a later manufacturing stage khanam and almaadeed 2015 and do not necessarily rule out pre production pellets as viable sources of bt uvs to mimico concentrations of industrial pellets and fragments of up to 43 particles per m3 were observed in samples predominantly wet weather samples from mimico creek indicating that stormwater indeed transports such items from nearby plastic industries tsui et al 2020 3 4 4 flushing of particles accumulating on surfaces none of the three hypothesized sources is likely to be fully responsible for the high bt uvs levels measured in mimico creek however the measurements provide some new hints about the characteristics of the source of bt uvs the enrichment of bt uvs in mimico creek during the event fig 4a s5a is predominantly due to an influx of contaminated particles particle bound bt uv first flushes observed especially in mmd and in mol for uv328 and uv234 further point to the washing off of surfaces on which bt uv particles have built up both of these effects occur to a lower extent at the rouge watershed consistent with the increased natural land cover and infiltration in rouge of the three sampling campaigns that have been undertaken at mimico for bt uvs parajulee et al 2018 and this study the highest concentrations were observed in november 2014 a period when the topsoil was likely frozen due to sub zero temperatures and which had the driest antecedent period preceding the rain event while the lowest concentrations were found in this study undertaken during a wet summer period there is evidently a relationship between bt uv stream water concentrations and the existence of environmental factors which promote increased overland particle wash off during the drier antecedent period in 2014 more bt uv contaminated particles repeatedly accumulated on surrounding impervious surfaces and were readily available for wash off into the creek when the rain event finally occurred the use of uv328 in automotive coatings and paints in canada environment and climate change canada 2016 provides a plausible source of this contaminated particle buildup as of 2013 10 000 to 100 000 kg of uv328 was imported into canada annually not including the amount present in finished articles environment and climate change canada 2016 and 37 of uv328 in canada is used in the automobile industry mimico creek watershed contains major highways and road networks and has a population of over 110 000 people toronto and region conservation authority 2020 corresponding to at least 1600 people km2 such a dense urbanized region is likely to have a lot of vehicles personal and public and thus more uv328 containing materials paint chippings from cars have previously been shown to contribute to road surface buildup of heavy metal contaminants deletic and orr 2005 and contaminants on road surfaces are easily transported into surface water during wet weather as is evidenced by the detection of tire and road wear particles in stormwater samples grbić et al 2020 in addition road dust samples from mimico creek watershed analyzed for bt uvs contained up to 88 of uv328 parajulee et al 2018 although the composition of the road dust was not investigated again here the high fraction of uv328 and the absence of uvp which is not known to be used in automotive applications in canada in these samples suggests that vehicle paint chippings may very well be a major component since bt uv profiles within a given region are similar a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using the road dust samples from parajulee et al 2018 golf balls stream water ss samples and rainwater ss samples from this study fig s3 the close clustering of mol stormflow samples with road dust and rainwater and baseflow samples with golf balls support the elucidation above samples at mhw and mmd however displayed no obvious clusters from which inferences could be drawn in addition to uv328 our results indicate that uvp uv326 and uv234 are most ubiquitous in ontario consistent with other studies in this region lu et al 2016 parajulee et al 2018 4 conclusion bt uvs which are hydrophobic compounds are shown here to sometimes be transported in the freely dissolved phase in aquatic systems uv326 which has a predicted log k ow of 6 1 was found to be predominantly transported in the dissolved phase during a rainfall event studies of bt uvs in aquatic environmental systems should consider both partitioning phases to prevent underestimations whereas bt uv compositions are consistent in similar regions actual concentrations can be influenced by seasonal and event characteristics in urban and rural areas bt uvs have similar transport mechanisms but variable concentrations which correspond to differences in emissions and land use in these areas the rapid transport of accumulated bt uv contaminated particles to surface water is a major entry route for bt uvs although wastewater is an important vector for bt uv transport we assert that these other possible routes need to be evaluated as they could be delivering comparable or higher amounts of bt uvs we also show that informal disposal of plastic debris can provide both sources and sinks of bt uvs in aquatic systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

2019 large ro plants are required to achieve high energy efficiency and ro is limited to brine concentrations lower than 1 6 mol l as monovalent salt assuming an 80 bar limit for spiral wound ro pressure vessels subramani and jacangelo 2014 electrically driven desalination processes avoid the mechanical limitations of ro by separating dissolved ions rather than h2o molecules among such processes suss et al 2015 tang et al 2019 faradaic deionization fdi using cation intercalation materials cims shows great promise on the basis of reversible na concentrations in the solid state namely 5 m for the prussian blue analogue investigated here with 65 mah g charge capacity and 2 g cc nominal density that exceed seawater salinity 0 5 mol l as nacl by ten fold techno economic analysis of fdi and comparison with the more frequently studied capacitive deionization cdi shows that the former method outputs more desalinated water at lower cost while being a more compact technology in part due to cims having greater capacity metzger et al 2020 despite our early modeling that introduced a symmetric na ion battery architecture to desalinate seawater using cims liu and smith 2018 smith 2017 smith and dmello 2016 subsequent experimental demonstrations thereof failed to realize more than 30 salt removal from continuously flowing brackish water kim et al 2017 porada et al 2017 reale et al 2019 we posit here that efficiency losses within auxiliary systems must be understood in conjunction with electrode scale transport processes to extend fdi using cims beyond brackish salinity the configuration of electrolyte flow through porous electrodes liu and smith 2018 reale et al 2019 smith 2017 son et al 2020 and charge transport within porous electrodes reale et al 2019 shrivastava and smith 2018 are known to affect rate capability and energy consumption in fdi when using symmetric cim electrodes but past results suggest that unknown mechanisms remain and prevent the salt removal potential of cims from being accessed in fdi saltwater can flow through a gap between electrodes in a flow by configuration or directly through the porous structure of electrodes sandwiched within a cell in a flow through configuration flow through electrodes incorporating prussian blue analogue pba cims which we first demonstrated reale et al 2019 have shown improved salt removal smith 2017 charge utilization liu and smith 2018 smith 2017 son et al 2020 and specific energy consumption smith 2017 son et al 2020 compared to flow by pba electrodes due to charge efficiency loss at electrode channel interfaces in flow by liu and smith 2018 smith 2017 and smaller ohmic drop in flow through son et al 2020 further our experiments introducing flow through fdi achieved rapid salt removal with one order of magnitude lower specific energy consumption as provided by judicious choice of electronically conductive additives reale et al 2019 and inspired by our earlier work demonstrating that nanoparticle agglomeration limits transport in electrodes containing pbas shrivastava and smith 2018 however charge efficiency diminished at higher current densities due to low utilization shortening cycle time an effect that complementary modeling indicated was likely a result of strong salt concentration gradients in both the streamwise and transverse directions within porous electrodes reale et al 2019 along those lines our past modeling revealed that streamwise salt concentration gradients in feedwater result in streamwise state of charge gradients in cims within the porous electrodes through which feedwater flows liu and smith 2018 while such state of charge gradients lead to efficiency loss and decreased cim capacity utilization we predicted that recirculation of feedwater can minimize such deleterious effects liu and smith 2018 while recirculation eliminates the coupling between flow rate and salt removal that constrains single pass architectures past studies liu et al 2021 pothanamkandathil et al 2020 singh et al 2020 provided limited detail concerning the approaches used to repeatedly cycle feedwater through a single two electrode fdi cell and such studies only demonstrated a cumulative salt removal as high as 40 mm singh et al 2020 along similar lines others have flowed feedwater in series through flow compartments in an electrodialysis ed stack while only reducing the salinity of 25 mm influent by 30 kim et al 2017 the development of novel high capacity electrode materials for electrochemical desalination including cdi and ed has been regarded as unable to significantly reduce energy consumption compared to ro patel et al 2020 however we show here that improvements can be achieved in fdi through reduction of streamwise concentration state of charge gradients increasing electrode conductivity and development of auxiliary flow control systems optimizing salt removal in conjunction accordingly we demonstrate and detail for the first time an automated multi pass fdi architecture using recirculation from brine and diluate reservoirs enabled by custom low volume valves and a low cost arduino control system beyond such effects we postulate that the porosity of flow through fdi electrodes can be engineered to increase degree of desalination in flow through fdi cells mass balance on a representative volume element of a porous electrode with porosity ε and cim volumetric loading ν suggests that decreasing porosity from as cast values of 85 reale et al 2019 to 67 could increase degree of desalination by over three fold 1 1 neglecting volume within electrodes comprised by conductive additives and binder and assuming perfect transmission of solution through porous electrodes the maximum cation concentration change within solution δ c s o l n that could be effected by transferring such cations into a cim with a reversible cation concentration δ c s o l i d is given by δ c s o l n δ c s o l i d 1 ε ε which is conceivable by densification of electrodes calendering the process of compressing electrodes between two rollers is known to increase electronic conductivity and improve rate capability van bommel and divigalpitiya 2012 but decreased porosity and increased tortuosity are known to reduce ionic conductivity ebner et al 2014 landesfeind et al 2016 malifarge et al 2017 while these competing effects may result in a certain degree of calendering that maximizes fdi performance the fabrication of thick electrodes with the areal capacity levels needed to create low porosity electrodes using calendering is a challenge in itself the reduction of cost and inactive mass in li ion batteries gallagher et al 2016 has motivated development of alternative electrode fabrication processes to yield high areal capacity zolin et al 2019 due to the tendency of conventionally prepared electrodes to crack during drying after slurry casting to this end we use a wet phase inversion wpi process that eliminates the capillary bridge induced cracking that arises during electrode solidification by drying while we bhat et al 2019 reale et al 2019 reale and smith 2018 and others lim et al 2009 have used wpi to fabricate electrodes for fdi and cdi using a room temperature pure water bath here we introduce a heated alkaline wpi process inspired by the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory of inter particle forces in colloids goodwin 2009 the dlvo theory has previously predicted percolation thresholds in simulated dispersions maria et al 2015 and is applied here towards slurry constituents to induce solidification of thick high conductivity electrodes that we subsequently calender while past simulations based on brownian dynamics of conductive particles in electrode slurries predicted that larger particles form conductive paths more easily cerbelaud et al 2015 our previous experiments reale et al 2019 on slurries containing pba nanoparticles and carbon black showed trends opposite those simulations rather than expecting particles to pack together randomly as in brownian dynamics we posit per dlvo theory that van der waals and electrostatic forces influence their dynamics to a degree dependent on particle radii zeta potential and hamaker constants of the associated particles and on the dielectric properties of intervening fluid while the interplay between such forces has been simulated for li ion battery electrodes showing variations in electrode microstructure dependent on the mass fraction particle size and temperature of both cim and additive particles zhu et al 2014 2011 few studies cho et al 2007 have previously exploited understanding of such interactions in experimental electrode fabrication in doing so our colloid inspired electrode fabrication process results in more electronically conductive and mechanically stable electrodes that do not crack at high cast thicknesses calendering of these electrodes increases their density and electronic conductivity which are shown to enhance salt removal and thermodynamic efficiency in fdi a brief outline of this article follows we first discuss a novel wet phase inversion process and the effects of electrode calendering which we use in conjunction to fabricate electrodes with low porosity high areal capacity and high rate capability we then present results for the cycling of such electrodes in fdi desalination experiments in such experiments we employ a custom lab scale recirculating fdi cell to alternate flow paths such that feedwater in one reservoir continuously desalinates while another reservoir simultaneously concentrates after several cycles using the densest electrodes the diluate reservoir is shown to reach 90 salt removal from 100 mm nacl influent before reaching a limit caused by desalinated and concentrated effluent mixing the use of denser electrodes is further shown to decrease energy consumption achieving 80 thermodynamic energy efficiency tee at 80 salt removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrode fabrication conductivity measurements and flooded cell characterization pba nanoparticles and associated slurries were prepared as in our previous work reale et al 2019 shrivastava and smith 2018 with electrodes composed of 85 wt nickel hexacyanoferrate nihcf pba 5 wt ec 600jd ketjen black and 10 wt solef polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf binder the first electrodes were cast at 150 µm thick onto 100 µm thick 2010a high purity graphite foil current collector ceramaterials and subsequent electrodes were cast at higher thicknesses of 250 µm and 320 µm as described in the results and discussion section after being cast and solidified using wet phase inversion wpi as described subsequently the electrodes were calendered using an mti roll press to a targeted thickness of 150 µm as measured by an mti thickness gage porosity ε was then calculated from the densities ρ i of the total electrode and its solid constituents as ε 1 ρ e l e c t r o d e ρ s o l i d electrochemical cycling of these electrodes was performed at several c rates in a 1 m nacl flooded cell versus a ag agcl reference electrode with a graphite counter electrode we used wpi to solidify electrodes after casting here an as cast slurry film supported on a current collector was immersed in a water bath to displace n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp solvent and solidify the pvdf binder dissolved therein to form a mechanically stable electrode bhat et al 2019 reale et al 2019 reale and smith 2018 while previous wpi processes used room temperature deionized water baths for phase inversion we explored modified bath conditions to improve electrode properties initial tests were done using 1 µm al2o3 particles advalue technology as a surrogate for pba material due to supply limitations for the latter material as in our previous work optimizing electrode conductivity without calendering reale et al 2019 as timcal super c45 carbon black mti had previously been shown to be an inferior conductive additive compared to ketjen black c45 was used in initial studies with the expectation that improvements in conductivity would be more obvious than with ketjen black to measure the electronic conductivity of electrodes slurries were cast onto an insulative ptfe substrate and conductivity was measured using an in house built four point probe reale et al 2019 to influence the inter particle forces within slurries a 200 ml wpi water bath was used to explore the effects of three different experimental parameters 1 using a hot plate to heat the water between 25 c and 85 c 2 increasing bath ph from 7 to 12 by adding naoh and 3 increasing salt concentration by dissolving nacl up to 450 mm see si section s3 pba electrodes immersed in the high ph bath also displayed structural stability when cast at high thickness resulting in electrode solidification at 320 µm when an electrode that thick would normally crack during drying if phase inversed using a room temperature neutral ph water bath 2 2 fdi system design and control the custom built fdi cell used in our previous study reale et al 2019 was employed for desalination experiments in conjunction with a custom built recirculating fluid circuit connected to it see fig 4 si section s1 and video s1 the fdi cell used two pba electrodes separated by a neosepta amx anion exchange membrane astom corp in all desalination experiments two test tubes were filled with 5 ml of saltwater to be converted to brine and diluate during cycling with initial concentrations of 100 mm or 200 mm in a separate experiment to direct flow an arduino controller actuated four servos to pinch branching paths of rubber tubing ensuring that feedwater from only one reservoir flowed through either side of the fdi cell video s1 flow rates of both effluent streams were kept constant and equal by using a masterflex peristaltic pump and all experiments used a flow rate of 1 ml min which was chosen as four fold higher than our previous experiments using a single pass system reale et al 2019 to reduce streamwise salt concentration gradients proportionally with diluate and brine reservoir volumes being equal the water recovery rate in all experiments was 50 images of the complete cell design details of its fluid circuit and its electrical control system are found in si section s1 salt concentration at the two inlets and two outlets was measured using four custom built flow through conductivity sensors connected to an edaq isopod which recorded conductivity using the program podvu 2 3 desalination experiments all desalination experiments used a current density of 1 ma cm2 applied to 2 5 cm2 electrodes by a biologic vmp 3 potentiostat over a voltage window of 0 45 v based on our measured values of hydraulic permeability we estimate a pressure drop across the fdi cell of 71 6 kpa and 430 kpa respectively for cycling with the least and highest areal capacity electrodes tested here at a 1 ml min flow rate the time delay between the start of open circuit oc conditions and inlet valve iv actuation was set to 20 s in all fdi experiments roughly twice the duration of the time delay between iv and outlet valve ov actuation to uniformize concentration on the respective sides of the cell during the oc period before iv actuation electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis tests were performed with frequencies ranging from 100 khz to 100 mhz to study impedance changes from cycle to cycle lower frequencies were not tested because doing so prolonged experiments the time delay between actuation of ivs and ovs was different for each electrode pair and was calculated using a calibration process described in si section s2 prior to each experiment the conductivity probes used were calibrated with 100 and 200 mm nacl influent known to respectively have conductivities of 1 067 and 2 034 s m at 298 k chambers et al 1956 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrode fabrication techniques we first report on experiments aimed at fabricating high conductivity high areal capacity pba electrodes predicated on the hypothesis that their use in fdi will increase salt removal to fabricate pba electrodes with high areal loading and low porosity we initially used our past wpi procedure reale et al 2019 using a room temperature deionized di water bath for phase inversion to fabricate 250 µm thick electrodes that were subsequently calendered to lower thicknesses yielding electrodes of varied porosity fig 1 a shows the results for cycling of an electrode with different degrees of calendering using a 1 m nacl flooded cell with a graphite counter electrode and a ag agcl reference electrode these results indicate that as electrode thickness and porosity decrease electrode rate capability increases between rates of 2 6c and 10 3c 1c corresponds to discharge of 65 mah g in 1 hr utilization of an uncalendered 250 µm electrode reduced by 64 while the same electrode calendered down to 72 µm showed only 18 reduction in utilization and showed 34 greater capacity at 2 6c relative to 250 µm electrodes cycled at the same rate returning to the lowest c rate after cycling each sample at 10 3c confirmed that the capacity drops observed at high rate were not due to electrode degradation despite the concern of low porosity increasing ionic resistance in porous electrodes ebner et al 2014 landesfeind et al 2016 calendered electrodes showed no rate capability decrease due to lost pore volume however we found that electrodes cast at thickness greater than 250 µm readily cracked when using conventional wpi motivating our search for improved electrode fabrication conditions to overcome areal loading limitations and increase electrode performance overall we analyzed the colloidal interactions between particles in electrode slurry occurring during wpi processes we postulate that the forces between active pba and conductive carbon black particles during microstructure formation of an electrode can be engineered to promote aggregation of conductive particles and increase effective electronic conductivity to guide our investigation of such we employed dlvo theory the application of which suggests that decreased conductor active particle aggregation is achievable by conductors and active particles having like signed zeta potential making them mutually repulsive see si section s3 furthermore dlvo theory suggests that temperature affects electrostatic interactions subsequently we alter wpi bath conditions and show that repulsive forces between carbon and active particles can be increased causing more carbon to aggregate into a conductive backbone and yielding increased electronic conductivity accordingly we performed modified wpi experiments on cast electrode slurries to characterize the effects of the temperature and ph of inversion baths on electronic conductivity so as to modulate electrostatic colloidal interactions respectively via debye length and zeta potential to do this we formulated slurries comprised of conductive particles c45 carbon black and surrogate particles replacing low conductivity pba al2o3 figs 2 a and 2b show variations of electronic conductivity respectively with temperature and ph where temperatures of 80 90 c and ph 12 are shown to produce 2 3 times higher conductivity than the baseline case at room temperature and neutral ph when 5 wt carbon black is used the changes in electronic conductivity observed among the different wpi conditions despite containing the same constituent mass fractions are qualitatively consistent with dlvo theory increasing ph causes zeta potential to decline for both particle phases and a sufficient increase thereof can cause surrogate active particles to become negatively charged singh et al 2005 however carbon black particles have been found to possess negative zeta potential at ph 7 sis and birinci 2017 indicating that surrogate active particles and carbon black experience strong electrostatic attraction at ph 7 because increasing ph beyond 7 causes carbon black particles to have increasingly negative zeta potential carbon and surrogate active particles repel each other in alkaline solution additionally increasing bath temperature gives carbon particles more kinetic energy to overcome potential energy barriers increasing the likelihood of carbon particle aggregation variations of the corresponding potential energy curves are presented in the si to illustrate these concepts section s3 because a third condition for the wpi bath dissolution of inert salt produced mild effects on electrode formulation see si section s3 we next explored the potential for synergistic interactions of increased temperature and ph to enhance electrode formulation fig 2c shows that the resulting electronic conductivity obtained for a bath heated at 85 c using different levels of alkaline ph increases to a greater degree than when using modified temperature or ph conditions separately in electrodes containing 2 5 wt carbon black conductivity increased by up to 167 times compared to electrodes immersed in room temperature di water informed by findings obtained with surrogative active material and c45 carbon black we subsequently used wpi bath conditions that yielded highest electronic conductivity 85 c and ph 12 to fabricate pba electrodes containing ketjen black conductor for which our previous work reale et al 2019 demonstrated improved electronic conductivity relative to c45 carbon black flooded cell cycling comparing wpi processes was performed shown in fig 1b the electrode wet phase inversed in a heated alkaline bath showed superior rate capability compared to electrodes prepared using standard conditions consistent with the results obtained using surrogate material that showed increased electronic conductivity under such conditions in addition the modified wpi conditions were shown to prevent cracking of electrodes with thicknesses as large as 320 µm despite an electrode immersed in 85 c neutral ph water cracking at 320 µm this finding confirms the critical role of wpi bath ph in preserving the mechanical integrity of thick electrodes we postulate that binder solution interactions such as the hofmeister effect thormann 2012 may also increase binder uniformity within electrodes and consequently increase mechanical strength to acquire visual evidence for the effect of electrode fabrication conditions on microstructure sem images of di water immersed and heated alkaline immersed electrodes were obtained fig 3 including images taken before and after calendering to 50 of their initial thickness while the microstructures of uncalendered electrodes prepared using conventional and modified wpi processes were indistinguishable figs 3a 3c wpi conditions were shown to affect the texture of calendered electrodes substantially fig 3b and 3d specifically the conventional wpi process produced a relatively smooth and occluded calendered surface compared with the modified wpi process consistent with the postulate that increased ph and temperature during wpi increases binder uniformity throughout electrodes this observation is also consistent with the results of flooded cell cycling which showed improved rate capability for electrodes prepared using the modified wpi process fig 3e shows an x ray computed tomography ct scan of a calendered electrode prepared by modified wpi confirming that the modified wpi process yields a homogeneous distribution of pba particles within the microstructure over a 200 µm by 200 µm area however a larger area of 620 µm by 790 µm reveals defective fissures constituting approximately 5 to 10 of the overall volume in the electrode fig s11 and video s2 to understand the impact of such fissures we measured these electrodes hydraulic permeability using a simple gravity driven apparatus reale et al 2019 the densest calendered electrodes had a permeability of 0 23 µm2 compared with the uncalendered electrodes 1 38 µm2 due to their decreased porosity and average micropore radius this finding indicates that flow is forced through the microporous regions of these electrodes and is therefore not short circuited through defective fissures these results for electrode microstructure flooded cell cycling and electronic conductivity motivated use of the modified wpi process and electrode calendering with cims in a cation intercalation desalination fdi cell 3 2 recirculating fdi desalination performance fdi experiments were conducted using an in house custom built flow cell and integrated fluid recirculation system fig 4 a d si section s1 valves at the outlets ovs and inlets ivs of both electrodes direct salt water respectively to and from the reservoirs for brine br or diluate dr as shown in fig 4b and c fig 4e shows the corresponding variations of cell voltage and influent salt concentrations with time the latter measured by conductivity probes at the inlet regions of both electrodes when the cell was subjected to galvanostatic cycling with either positive pc or negative nc current followed by a brief open circuit oc period in addition to constructing the cell with the lowest internal volume possible by using narrow inner diameter tubing and custom parts dimensioned to minimize volume experiments were conducted to optimize valve timing to reduce mixing between diluate and brine streams pause periods were added at the end of each pc nc period to minimize mixing by accounting for residence time in the internal volume of the system as described in si section s2 hence fig 4e and video s1 show a finite time delay between switching events of electrical current and both ivs and ovs denoted as ivs switch and ovs switch after calibrating such events we observed salt concentration varying linearly with time during initial cycles and that salt removal per cycle declined during successive cycles due to diluate and brine effluent streams mixing using this apparatus with the electrical fluidic cycling sequences already described we explored the effect of pba electrode formulation on fdi performance as a point of reference use of this recirculating fdi apparatus with electrodes having the same formulation porosity 85 and areal loading 5 3 mg pba cm2 as in our previous work reale et al 2019 yielded 65 salt removal from 100 mm nacl solution in contrast with 27 salt removal in our previous single pass experiments we then tested electrodes cast at 250 µm thick solidified with wpi using room temperature di water and calendered to 150 µm thick yielding 8 7 mg pba cm2 and 75 porosity the corresponding experiments produced 80 salt removal owing to the increased capacity and reduced mixing volume between brine and diluate effluent from denser electrodes the third pair of electrodes was first cast and solidified by wpi in 85 c water with ph 12 resulting in a 320 µm electrode that was subsequently calendered down to 150 µm yielding 11 1 mg pba cm2 and 67 porosity this further increase of areal loading and decrease of porosity produced a maximum salt removal of 90 from 100 mm influent corresponding to a productivity of 3 3 l hour m2 a final test using 200 mm influent with the 11 1 mg pba cm2 electrodes was performed because the electrodes removed more salt per half cycle 104 mm was removed from the 200 mm influent before becoming limited by mixing due to increased ionic conductivity and decreased concentration polarization improving capacity utilization these high salt removals achieved using increased electrode densities yielded different levels of specific energy consumption sec to reduce initial concentration c i to a diluate concentration c d as shown in fig 5 a and calculated by the equation sec e total c i c d v rese rvoir with net energy consumption including energy recovery e total and dr volume vreservoir units of kwh m3 are an alternate method of expressing sec shown in fig 5b omitting concentration and calculated as sec e total v rese voir we note that these sec values are calculated based on the cumulative energy invested and the cumulative salt removal achieved rather the energy invested and salt removed per cycle due to the high electronic conductivity and active particle loading of electrodes produced by the modified wpi process the fdi system achieved excellent salt removal at an sec that approaches the thermodynamic minimum separation energy se c min 2 rt c d ln c d 1 γ 1 c b ln c b c i γ ln c i c i c d where γ is the water recovery rate here 50 and c b is brine concentration as we show later decreased energy consumption with increased electrode density is linked to the reduced ohmic resistance of such electrodes see fig 7a and discussion thereof our previous work using the same cell operating at the same current density 1 ma cm2 in single pass mode showed a simulated sec of 2 7 kj mol reale et al 2019 while the 5 3 mg cm2 electrodes sharing the same composition have an initial sec of 3 04 kj mol as the present system reached the limit of salt removal due to the mixing of diluate and brine further cycling consumed significantly more energy causing sec to rise steeply while salt removal stagnated because all experiments used the same flow rate and current density the average salt absorption rate asar was initially 0 55 0 6 µmol cm2 min for all three experiments asar declines with the mixing effect decreasing removal each cycle becoming 0 51 µmol cm2 min on average when the experiment with 11 1 mg cm2 electrodes concluded at the highest salt removal with 100 mm influent the thermodynamic energy efficiency tee of the recirculating cell defined as tee se c min sec was 50 but tee reached as high as 80 for the densest electrodes before mixing outweighed the electrodes ability to remove salt in a single cycle fig 5c one reason for the high tee is the high salt removal shown in fig 5a where sec for all three electrodes increases linearly with salt removal during early cycles at low salt removal the thermodynamic minimum is low compared to the experimental secs but as both experimental and theoretical secs increase the ratio between them increases as well the present 100 mm influent is more ionically conductive than the 20 50 mm influents used in other studies and the denser highly conductive electrodes created here consume less energy due to smaller ohmic losses that we show subsequently it should also be noted that the cell operated at only 1 ma cm2 and sec for similar electrodes increased approximately linearly with current density in our past work reale et al 2019 while such results demonstrate the practical benefits of high areal loading for increased desalination performance inspection of specific capacity attained from cycle to cycle revealed trends suggesting further room for improvement fig 6 a shows that utilization of charge capacity declined with increasing salt removal though high areal capacity electrodes retain the most capacity when comparing the 8 7 mg cm2 and 11 1 mg cm2 electrodes the former electrodes only utilize 45 of their capacity at 80 salt removal while at the same salt removal the latter electrodes retained 87 utilization this outcome is likely a result of high areal capacity electrodes producing greater flow efficiency defined as the ratio between time for the electrodes porous volume to be replaced and the charging time hawks et al 2018 because denser electrodes have smaller pore volume feedwater is removed fast enough to supply fresh sodium ions for intercalation into pba particles and between the lowest and highest areal loadings flow efficiency increases by 30 the specific capacity of electrodes during experiments with 200 mm remained high even when the cell reached the limits of its salt removal due to abundant sodium in solution though the flow rate was four times higher than what our single pass experiments previously used reale et al 2019 0 25 ml min decreasing charge capacity at high salt removal suggests that gradients of salt concentration and pba state of charge decrease utilization however the disparate concentrations of salt in diluate and brine streams near the end of a recirculating fdi process are also expected to produce concentration polarization and ohmic polarization limiting capacity when performing galvanostatic cycling within a finite cell voltage window the inability of such a system to continue removing salt also causes charge efficiency to decline during later charge discharge cycles fig 6b eventually reaching zero salt removal at a certain cycle number during either the pc or nc period of each half cycle we observed that charge efficiency remained at 80 95 but cumulative charge efficiency approached zero at later half cycles due to effluent mixing counteracting salt removal during valve switching events occuring during oc periods to analyze the influence of cell impedance on desalination performance we conducted electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis during the oc periods of each cycle fig 7 a these spectra show that real impedance at high frequency gradually increases from cycle to cycle as a result of one side of the cell becoming less ionically conductive during salt removal this effect is evidenced by the voltage versus capacity curves measured during pc and nc cycling fig 7b where increased polarization pushes average cell voltage nearer to the edges of the voltage window within which cycling occurs from the initial cycle to the final cycle the degree of polarization increase differs with each type of electrode and the final salt removal attained however polarization is largest during cycles with highest salt removal and when real impedance at high frequency is largest in fig 7a electrodes with 5 3 mg cm2 show little change in real impedance between the first and final cycles despite attaining 65 salt removal however real impedance at high frequency in the denser electrodes increased more than two fold this limited change of impedance for electrodes with lower areal capacity can be understood by assuming that ionic conductivity is directly proportional to salt concentration eq 1 shows the theoretical ratio between ionic resistance at a certain degree of salt removal in mm r ion δ c c i c d and the initial resistance when both anode and cathode contain influent of the same concentration 1 r ion δ c r ion δ c 0 1 2 1 1 δ c c i 1 1 δ c c i this simple relation reveals that only at 71 mm of salt removal from 100 mm does the theoretical ionic resistance double furthermore ionic resistance within electrodes is only one source of impedance including electronic resistance warburg impedance aem impedance and contact resistance in external circuitry the minor influence of salt concentration on impedance is further demonstrated in si fig s6 and section s2 in any case fig 7b shows that increasing impedance with increasing salt removal results in increased polarization average voltage during the first and final half cycles increased from 0 07 v to 0 29 v as the 11 1 mg pba cm2 achieved 90 salt removal lowering utilization and limiting maximum salt removal the calendering of electrodes is therefore shown to increase electronic conductivity and reduce ohmic energy losses keeping energy consumption low at high salt removal finally table 1 compares energy consumption achieved recently in fdi using symmetric electrode architectures as each work tested an fdi system at different current densities and flow rates the values shown are for the highest salt removal achieved the present results show slightly higher asar than most cases and achieved an excellent 90 salt removal a higher fraction than any other listed however the sec of 10 9 kj mol acheived at this exceptional salt removal level is high due to effluent mixing however at 80 salt removal an sec of 5 7 kj mol was achieved approaching the thermodynamic minimum energy of 4 5 kj mol for that salt removal level and reaching an exceptional thermodynamic energy efficiency of 80 4 conclusions in this work a recirculating flow through faradaic deionization apparatus was demonstrated and shown to produce 90 salt removed from one reservoir of 100 mm aqueous nacl transferring the salt into a second reservoir of brine with 50 water recovery rate in the same experiment 80 salt removal was achieved with a thermodynamic energy efficiency of 80 it was shown that recirculating cell performance is limited by diluate and brine mixing during valve switching processes the effects of which were minimized through the use of an open circuit period during which the inlet and outlet valves were switched at different times such pause periods improved desalination performance however they could not totally eliminate mixing effects resulting in an upper limit for salt removal and a lower limit for specific energy consumption that is highest for porous electrodes with high areal capacity and low porosity we showed this by fabricating electrodes using a novel wet phase inversion process incorporating a heated alkaline water bath for the first time to solidify electrodes with high areal capacity that were subsequently calendered to achieve simultaneously low porosity impedance spectra measured during the open circuit periods of fdi cycling showed that the electronic resistance of electrodes was reduced by their calendering and flooded cell experiments showed better utilization despite the significant improvements demonstrated relative to prior work limitations other than electrode areal capacity make further increases in salt removal unattainable for the current cell even with the present recirculating apparatus reducing the ratio of internal fluid volume within flow passages to the pore volume of electrodes is likely to lead to further improvements in desalination performance further decreasing the effect of mixing between brine and diluate streams however the degree of apparent mixing is likely to include the effects of diffusion and dispersion at interfaces between diluate and brine streams the present results show significant pumping power requirements approximately 0 12 kwh m3 for the densest electrodes during each pass of water over the complete desalination process this energy consumption is multiplied by over 50 fold due to the same fluid being recirculated making pumping energy exceed the electrical energy by an order of magnitude thus pumping power should be targeted as another area for improving fdi performance in particular when using flow through electrodes these results motivate other approaches to minimize losses that arise due to such effects including scale up of the fdi cell the current fdi cell possesses pore volume when incorporating the lowest porosity electrodes tested 67 that is 70 of the total volume within tubing and manifold supplying influent to the electrodes an fdi cell with increased capacity constructed using more electrode area with similar areal capacity would increase total electrode pore volume in proportion to cell capacity while holding tube volume constant declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

19937,prussian blue analogues pbas show great potential for low energy faradaic deionization fdi with reversible na ion capacity approaching 5 m in the solid state however past continuous flow demonstrations using pbas in fdi were unable to desalinate brackish water to potable levels using single pass architectures here we show that recirculation of effluent from a symmetric cation intercalation desalination cell into brine diluate reservoirs enables salt removal exceeding 80 at thermodynamic efficiency as high as 80 when cycled with 100 mm nacl influent and when controlled by a low volume automated fluid circuit this exceptional performance is achieved using a novel heated alkaline wet phase inversion process that modulates colloidal forces to increase carbon black aggregation within electrode slurries to solidify crack free high areal capacity pba electrodes that are calendered to minimize cell impedance and electrode porosity the results obtained demonstrate the need for co design of auxiliary fluid control systems together with electrode materials to advance fdi beyond brackish salinity keywords desalination faradaic deionization thermodynamic energy efficiency colloids 1 introduction with more than half of humanity presently facing freshwater scarcity for one month during a given year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 desalination of sea and brackish waters could increase freshwater access elimelech and phillip 2011 however recent analysis estimates that roughly 1 5 units of concentrated brine are generated globally for every unit of desalinated water averaged across all water sources sectors and technologies jones et al 2019 depletion of natural freshwater sources motivates the need for new water treatment technologies while also combatting climate change by consuming less energy and replacing aging infrastructure mauter and fiske 2020 while reverse osmosis ro presently comprises the majority of global desalination capacity jones et al 2019 large ro plants are required to achieve high energy efficiency and ro is limited to brine concentrations lower than 1 6 mol l as monovalent salt assuming an 80 bar limit for spiral wound ro pressure vessels subramani and jacangelo 2014 electrically driven desalination processes avoid the mechanical limitations of ro by separating dissolved ions rather than h2o molecules among such processes suss et al 2015 tang et al 2019 faradaic deionization fdi using cation intercalation materials cims shows great promise on the basis of reversible na concentrations in the solid state namely 5 m for the prussian blue analogue investigated here with 65 mah g charge capacity and 2 g cc nominal density that exceed seawater salinity 0 5 mol l as nacl by ten fold techno economic analysis of fdi and comparison with the more frequently studied capacitive deionization cdi shows that the former method outputs more desalinated water at lower cost while being a more compact technology in part due to cims having greater capacity metzger et al 2020 despite our early modeling that introduced a symmetric na ion battery architecture to desalinate seawater using cims liu and smith 2018 smith 2017 smith and dmello 2016 subsequent experimental demonstrations thereof failed to realize more than 30 salt removal from continuously flowing brackish water kim et al 2017 porada et al 2017 reale et al 2019 we posit here that efficiency losses within auxiliary systems must be understood in conjunction with electrode scale transport processes to extend fdi using cims beyond brackish salinity the configuration of electrolyte flow through porous electrodes liu and smith 2018 reale et al 2019 smith 2017 son et al 2020 and charge transport within porous electrodes reale et al 2019 shrivastava and smith 2018 are known to affect rate capability and energy consumption in fdi when using symmetric cim electrodes but past results suggest that unknown mechanisms remain and prevent the salt removal potential of cims from being accessed in fdi saltwater can flow through a gap between electrodes in a flow by configuration or directly through the porous structure of electrodes sandwiched within a cell in a flow through configuration flow through electrodes incorporating prussian blue analogue pba cims which we first demonstrated reale et al 2019 have shown improved salt removal smith 2017 charge utilization liu and smith 2018 smith 2017 son et al 2020 and specific energy consumption smith 2017 son et al 2020 compared to flow by pba electrodes due to charge efficiency loss at electrode channel interfaces in flow by liu and smith 2018 smith 2017 and smaller ohmic drop in flow through son et al 2020 further our experiments introducing flow through fdi achieved rapid salt removal with one order of magnitude lower specific energy consumption as provided by judicious choice of electronically conductive additives reale et al 2019 and inspired by our earlier work demonstrating that nanoparticle agglomeration limits transport in electrodes containing pbas shrivastava and smith 2018 however charge efficiency diminished at higher current densities due to low utilization shortening cycle time an effect that complementary modeling indicated was likely a result of strong salt concentration gradients in both the streamwise and transverse directions within porous electrodes reale et al 2019 along those lines our past modeling revealed that streamwise salt concentration gradients in feedwater result in streamwise state of charge gradients in cims within the porous electrodes through which feedwater flows liu and smith 2018 while such state of charge gradients lead to efficiency loss and decreased cim capacity utilization we predicted that recirculation of feedwater can minimize such deleterious effects liu and smith 2018 while recirculation eliminates the coupling between flow rate and salt removal that constrains single pass architectures past studies liu et al 2021 pothanamkandathil et al 2020 singh et al 2020 provided limited detail concerning the approaches used to repeatedly cycle feedwater through a single two electrode fdi cell and such studies only demonstrated a cumulative salt removal as high as 40 mm singh et al 2020 along similar lines others have flowed feedwater in series through flow compartments in an electrodialysis ed stack while only reducing the salinity of 25 mm influent by 30 kim et al 2017 the development of novel high capacity electrode materials for electrochemical desalination including cdi and ed has been regarded as unable to significantly reduce energy consumption compared to ro patel et al 2020 however we show here that improvements can be achieved in fdi through reduction of streamwise concentration state of charge gradients increasing electrode conductivity and development of auxiliary flow control systems optimizing salt removal in conjunction accordingly we demonstrate and detail for the first time an automated multi pass fdi architecture using recirculation from brine and diluate reservoirs enabled by custom low volume valves and a low cost arduino control system beyond such effects we postulate that the porosity of flow through fdi electrodes can be engineered to increase degree of desalination in flow through fdi cells mass balance on a representative volume element of a porous electrode with porosity ε and cim volumetric loading ν suggests that decreasing porosity from as cast values of 85 reale et al 2019 to 67 could increase degree of desalination by over three fold 1 1 neglecting volume within electrodes comprised by conductive additives and binder and assuming perfect transmission of solution through porous electrodes the maximum cation concentration change within solution δ c s o l n that could be effected by transferring such cations into a cim with a reversible cation concentration δ c s o l i d is given by δ c s o l n δ c s o l i d 1 ε ε which is conceivable by densification of electrodes calendering the process of compressing electrodes between two rollers is known to increase electronic conductivity and improve rate capability van bommel and divigalpitiya 2012 but decreased porosity and increased tortuosity are known to reduce ionic conductivity ebner et al 2014 landesfeind et al 2016 malifarge et al 2017 while these competing effects may result in a certain degree of calendering that maximizes fdi performance the fabrication of thick electrodes with the areal capacity levels needed to create low porosity electrodes using calendering is a challenge in itself the reduction of cost and inactive mass in li ion batteries gallagher et al 2016 has motivated development of alternative electrode fabrication processes to yield high areal capacity zolin et al 2019 due to the tendency of conventionally prepared electrodes to crack during drying after slurry casting to this end we use a wet phase inversion wpi process that eliminates the capillary bridge induced cracking that arises during electrode solidification by drying while we bhat et al 2019 reale et al 2019 reale and smith 2018 and others lim et al 2009 have used wpi to fabricate electrodes for fdi and cdi using a room temperature pure water bath here we introduce a heated alkaline wpi process inspired by the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory of inter particle forces in colloids goodwin 2009 the dlvo theory has previously predicted percolation thresholds in simulated dispersions maria et al 2015 and is applied here towards slurry constituents to induce solidification of thick high conductivity electrodes that we subsequently calender while past simulations based on brownian dynamics of conductive particles in electrode slurries predicted that larger particles form conductive paths more easily cerbelaud et al 2015 our previous experiments reale et al 2019 on slurries containing pba nanoparticles and carbon black showed trends opposite those simulations rather than expecting particles to pack together randomly as in brownian dynamics we posit per dlvo theory that van der waals and electrostatic forces influence their dynamics to a degree dependent on particle radii zeta potential and hamaker constants of the associated particles and on the dielectric properties of intervening fluid while the interplay between such forces has been simulated for li ion battery electrodes showing variations in electrode microstructure dependent on the mass fraction particle size and temperature of both cim and additive particles zhu et al 2014 2011 few studies cho et al 2007 have previously exploited understanding of such interactions in experimental electrode fabrication in doing so our colloid inspired electrode fabrication process results in more electronically conductive and mechanically stable electrodes that do not crack at high cast thicknesses calendering of these electrodes increases their density and electronic conductivity which are shown to enhance salt removal and thermodynamic efficiency in fdi a brief outline of this article follows we first discuss a novel wet phase inversion process and the effects of electrode calendering which we use in conjunction to fabricate electrodes with low porosity high areal capacity and high rate capability we then present results for the cycling of such electrodes in fdi desalination experiments in such experiments we employ a custom lab scale recirculating fdi cell to alternate flow paths such that feedwater in one reservoir continuously desalinates while another reservoir simultaneously concentrates after several cycles using the densest electrodes the diluate reservoir is shown to reach 90 salt removal from 100 mm nacl influent before reaching a limit caused by desalinated and concentrated effluent mixing the use of denser electrodes is further shown to decrease energy consumption achieving 80 thermodynamic energy efficiency tee at 80 salt removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrode fabrication conductivity measurements and flooded cell characterization pba nanoparticles and associated slurries were prepared as in our previous work reale et al 2019 shrivastava and smith 2018 with electrodes composed of 85 wt nickel hexacyanoferrate nihcf pba 5 wt ec 600jd ketjen black and 10 wt solef polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf binder the first electrodes were cast at 150 µm thick onto 100 µm thick 2010a high purity graphite foil current collector ceramaterials and subsequent electrodes were cast at higher thicknesses of 250 µm and 320 µm as described in the results and discussion section after being cast and solidified using wet phase inversion wpi as described subsequently the electrodes were calendered using an mti roll press to a targeted thickness of 150 µm as measured by an mti thickness gage porosity ε was then calculated from the densities ρ i of the total electrode and its solid constituents as ε 1 ρ e l e c t r o d e ρ s o l i d electrochemical cycling of these electrodes was performed at several c rates in a 1 m nacl flooded cell versus a ag agcl reference electrode with a graphite counter electrode we used wpi to solidify electrodes after casting here an as cast slurry film supported on a current collector was immersed in a water bath to displace n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp solvent and solidify the pvdf binder dissolved therein to form a mechanically stable electrode bhat et al 2019 reale et al 2019 reale and smith 2018 while previous wpi processes used room temperature deionized water baths for phase inversion we explored modified bath conditions to improve electrode properties initial tests were done using 1 µm al2o3 particles advalue technology as a surrogate for pba material due to supply limitations for the latter material as in our previous work optimizing electrode conductivity without calendering reale et al 2019 as timcal super c45 carbon black mti had previously been shown to be an inferior conductive additive compared to ketjen black c45 was used in initial studies with the expectation that improvements in conductivity would be more obvious than with ketjen black to measure the electronic conductivity of electrodes slurries were cast onto an insulative ptfe substrate and conductivity was measured using an in house built four point probe reale et al 2019 to influence the inter particle forces within slurries a 200 ml wpi water bath was used to explore the effects of three different experimental parameters 1 using a hot plate to heat the water between 25 c and 85 c 2 increasing bath ph from 7 to 12 by adding naoh and 3 increasing salt concentration by dissolving nacl up to 450 mm see si section s3 pba electrodes immersed in the high ph bath also displayed structural stability when cast at high thickness resulting in electrode solidification at 320 µm when an electrode that thick would normally crack during drying if phase inversed using a room temperature neutral ph water bath 2 2 fdi system design and control the custom built fdi cell used in our previous study reale et al 2019 was employed for desalination experiments in conjunction with a custom built recirculating fluid circuit connected to it see fig 4 si section s1 and video s1 the fdi cell used two pba electrodes separated by a neosepta amx anion exchange membrane astom corp in all desalination experiments two test tubes were filled with 5 ml of saltwater to be converted to brine and diluate during cycling with initial concentrations of 100 mm or 200 mm in a separate experiment to direct flow an arduino controller actuated four servos to pinch branching paths of rubber tubing ensuring that feedwater from only one reservoir flowed through either side of the fdi cell video s1 flow rates of both effluent streams were kept constant and equal by using a masterflex peristaltic pump and all experiments used a flow rate of 1 ml min which was chosen as four fold higher than our previous experiments using a single pass system reale et al 2019 to reduce streamwise salt concentration gradients proportionally with diluate and brine reservoir volumes being equal the water recovery rate in all experiments was 50 images of the complete cell design details of its fluid circuit and its electrical control system are found in si section s1 salt concentration at the two inlets and two outlets was measured using four custom built flow through conductivity sensors connected to an edaq isopod which recorded conductivity using the program podvu 2 3 desalination experiments all desalination experiments used a current density of 1 ma cm2 applied to 2 5 cm2 electrodes by a biologic vmp 3 potentiostat over a voltage window of 0 45 v based on our measured values of hydraulic permeability we estimate a pressure drop across the fdi cell of 71 6 kpa and 430 kpa respectively for cycling with the least and highest areal capacity electrodes tested here at a 1 ml min flow rate the time delay between the start of open circuit oc conditions and inlet valve iv actuation was set to 20 s in all fdi experiments roughly twice the duration of the time delay between iv and outlet valve ov actuation to uniformize concentration on the respective sides of the cell during the oc period before iv actuation electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis tests were performed with frequencies ranging from 100 khz to 100 mhz to study impedance changes from cycle to cycle lower frequencies were not tested because doing so prolonged experiments the time delay between actuation of ivs and ovs was different for each electrode pair and was calculated using a calibration process described in si section s2 prior to each experiment the conductivity probes used were calibrated with 100 and 200 mm nacl influent known to respectively have conductivities of 1 067 and 2 034 s m at 298 k chambers et al 1956 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrode fabrication techniques we first report on experiments aimed at fabricating high conductivity high areal capacity pba electrodes predicated on the hypothesis that their use in fdi will increase salt removal to fabricate pba electrodes with high areal loading and low porosity we initially used our past wpi procedure reale et al 2019 using a room temperature deionized di water bath for phase inversion to fabricate 250 µm thick electrodes that were subsequently calendered to lower thicknesses yielding electrodes of varied porosity fig 1 a shows the results for cycling of an electrode with different degrees of calendering using a 1 m nacl flooded cell with a graphite counter electrode and a ag agcl reference electrode these results indicate that as electrode thickness and porosity decrease electrode rate capability increases between rates of 2 6c and 10 3c 1c corresponds to discharge of 65 mah g in 1 hr utilization of an uncalendered 250 µm electrode reduced by 64 while the same electrode calendered down to 72 µm showed only 18 reduction in utilization and showed 34 greater capacity at 2 6c relative to 250 µm electrodes cycled at the same rate returning to the lowest c rate after cycling each sample at 10 3c confirmed that the capacity drops observed at high rate were not due to electrode degradation despite the concern of low porosity increasing ionic resistance in porous electrodes ebner et al 2014 landesfeind et al 2016 calendered electrodes showed no rate capability decrease due to lost pore volume however we found that electrodes cast at thickness greater than 250 µm readily cracked when using conventional wpi motivating our search for improved electrode fabrication conditions to overcome areal loading limitations and increase electrode performance overall we analyzed the colloidal interactions between particles in electrode slurry occurring during wpi processes we postulate that the forces between active pba and conductive carbon black particles during microstructure formation of an electrode can be engineered to promote aggregation of conductive particles and increase effective electronic conductivity to guide our investigation of such we employed dlvo theory the application of which suggests that decreased conductor active particle aggregation is achievable by conductors and active particles having like signed zeta potential making them mutually repulsive see si section s3 furthermore dlvo theory suggests that temperature affects electrostatic interactions subsequently we alter wpi bath conditions and show that repulsive forces between carbon and active particles can be increased causing more carbon to aggregate into a conductive backbone and yielding increased electronic conductivity accordingly we performed modified wpi experiments on cast electrode slurries to characterize the effects of the temperature and ph of inversion baths on electronic conductivity so as to modulate electrostatic colloidal interactions respectively via debye length and zeta potential to do this we formulated slurries comprised of conductive particles c45 carbon black and surrogate particles replacing low conductivity pba al2o3 figs 2 a and 2b show variations of electronic conductivity respectively with temperature and ph where temperatures of 80 90 c and ph 12 are shown to produce 2 3 times higher conductivity than the baseline case at room temperature and neutral ph when 5 wt carbon black is used the changes in electronic conductivity observed among the different wpi conditions despite containing the same constituent mass fractions are qualitatively consistent with dlvo theory increasing ph causes zeta potential to decline for both particle phases and a sufficient increase thereof can cause surrogate active particles to become negatively charged singh et al 2005 however carbon black particles have been found to possess negative zeta potential at ph 7 sis and birinci 2017 indicating that surrogate active particles and carbon black experience strong electrostatic attraction at ph 7 because increasing ph beyond 7 causes carbon black particles to have increasingly negative zeta potential carbon and surrogate active particles repel each other in alkaline solution additionally increasing bath temperature gives carbon particles more kinetic energy to overcome potential energy barriers increasing the likelihood of carbon particle aggregation variations of the corresponding potential energy curves are presented in the si to illustrate these concepts section s3 because a third condition for the wpi bath dissolution of inert salt produced mild effects on electrode formulation see si section s3 we next explored the potential for synergistic interactions of increased temperature and ph to enhance electrode formulation fig 2c shows that the resulting electronic conductivity obtained for a bath heated at 85 c using different levels of alkaline ph increases to a greater degree than when using modified temperature or ph conditions separately in electrodes containing 2 5 wt carbon black conductivity increased by up to 167 times compared to electrodes immersed in room temperature di water informed by findings obtained with surrogative active material and c45 carbon black we subsequently used wpi bath conditions that yielded highest electronic conductivity 85 c and ph 12 to fabricate pba electrodes containing ketjen black conductor for which our previous work reale et al 2019 demonstrated improved electronic conductivity relative to c45 carbon black flooded cell cycling comparing wpi processes was performed shown in fig 1b the electrode wet phase inversed in a heated alkaline bath showed superior rate capability compared to electrodes prepared using standard conditions consistent with the results obtained using surrogate material that showed increased electronic conductivity under such conditions in addition the modified wpi conditions were shown to prevent cracking of electrodes with thicknesses as large as 320 µm despite an electrode immersed in 85 c neutral ph water cracking at 320 µm this finding confirms the critical role of wpi bath ph in preserving the mechanical integrity of thick electrodes we postulate that binder solution interactions such as the hofmeister effect thormann 2012 may also increase binder uniformity within electrodes and consequently increase mechanical strength to acquire visual evidence for the effect of electrode fabrication conditions on microstructure sem images of di water immersed and heated alkaline immersed electrodes were obtained fig 3 including images taken before and after calendering to 50 of their initial thickness while the microstructures of uncalendered electrodes prepared using conventional and modified wpi processes were indistinguishable figs 3a 3c wpi conditions were shown to affect the texture of calendered electrodes substantially fig 3b and 3d specifically the conventional wpi process produced a relatively smooth and occluded calendered surface compared with the modified wpi process consistent with the postulate that increased ph and temperature during wpi increases binder uniformity throughout electrodes this observation is also consistent with the results of flooded cell cycling which showed improved rate capability for electrodes prepared using the modified wpi process fig 3e shows an x ray computed tomography ct scan of a calendered electrode prepared by modified wpi confirming that the modified wpi process yields a homogeneous distribution of pba particles within the microstructure over a 200 µm by 200 µm area however a larger area of 620 µm by 790 µm reveals defective fissures constituting approximately 5 to 10 of the overall volume in the electrode fig s11 and video s2 to understand the impact of such fissures we measured these electrodes hydraulic permeability using a simple gravity driven apparatus reale et al 2019 the densest calendered electrodes had a permeability of 0 23 µm2 compared with the uncalendered electrodes 1 38 µm2 due to their decreased porosity and average micropore radius this finding indicates that flow is forced through the microporous regions of these electrodes and is therefore not short circuited through defective fissures these results for electrode microstructure flooded cell cycling and electronic conductivity motivated use of the modified wpi process and electrode calendering with cims in a cation intercalation desalination fdi cell 3 2 recirculating fdi desalination performance fdi experiments were conducted using an in house custom built flow cell and integrated fluid recirculation system fig 4 a d si section s1 valves at the outlets ovs and inlets ivs of both electrodes direct salt water respectively to and from the reservoirs for brine br or diluate dr as shown in fig 4b and c fig 4e shows the corresponding variations of cell voltage and influent salt concentrations with time the latter measured by conductivity probes at the inlet regions of both electrodes when the cell was subjected to galvanostatic cycling with either positive pc or negative nc current followed by a brief open circuit oc period in addition to constructing the cell with the lowest internal volume possible by using narrow inner diameter tubing and custom parts dimensioned to minimize volume experiments were conducted to optimize valve timing to reduce mixing between diluate and brine streams pause periods were added at the end of each pc nc period to minimize mixing by accounting for residence time in the internal volume of the system as described in si section s2 hence fig 4e and video s1 show a finite time delay between switching events of electrical current and both ivs and ovs denoted as ivs switch and ovs switch after calibrating such events we observed salt concentration varying linearly with time during initial cycles and that salt removal per cycle declined during successive cycles due to diluate and brine effluent streams mixing using this apparatus with the electrical fluidic cycling sequences already described we explored the effect of pba electrode formulation on fdi performance as a point of reference use of this recirculating fdi apparatus with electrodes having the same formulation porosity 85 and areal loading 5 3 mg pba cm2 as in our previous work reale et al 2019 yielded 65 salt removal from 100 mm nacl solution in contrast with 27 salt removal in our previous single pass experiments we then tested electrodes cast at 250 µm thick solidified with wpi using room temperature di water and calendered to 150 µm thick yielding 8 7 mg pba cm2 and 75 porosity the corresponding experiments produced 80 salt removal owing to the increased capacity and reduced mixing volume between brine and diluate effluent from denser electrodes the third pair of electrodes was first cast and solidified by wpi in 85 c water with ph 12 resulting in a 320 µm electrode that was subsequently calendered down to 150 µm yielding 11 1 mg pba cm2 and 67 porosity this further increase of areal loading and decrease of porosity produced a maximum salt removal of 90 from 100 mm influent corresponding to a productivity of 3 3 l hour m2 a final test using 200 mm influent with the 11 1 mg pba cm2 electrodes was performed because the electrodes removed more salt per half cycle 104 mm was removed from the 200 mm influent before becoming limited by mixing due to increased ionic conductivity and decreased concentration polarization improving capacity utilization these high salt removals achieved using increased electrode densities yielded different levels of specific energy consumption sec to reduce initial concentration c i to a diluate concentration c d as shown in fig 5 a and calculated by the equation sec e total c i c d v rese rvoir with net energy consumption including energy recovery e total and dr volume vreservoir units of kwh m3 are an alternate method of expressing sec shown in fig 5b omitting concentration and calculated as sec e total v rese voir we note that these sec values are calculated based on the cumulative energy invested and the cumulative salt removal achieved rather the energy invested and salt removed per cycle due to the high electronic conductivity and active particle loading of electrodes produced by the modified wpi process the fdi system achieved excellent salt removal at an sec that approaches the thermodynamic minimum separation energy se c min 2 rt c d ln c d 1 γ 1 c b ln c b c i γ ln c i c i c d where γ is the water recovery rate here 50 and c b is brine concentration as we show later decreased energy consumption with increased electrode density is linked to the reduced ohmic resistance of such electrodes see fig 7a and discussion thereof our previous work using the same cell operating at the same current density 1 ma cm2 in single pass mode showed a simulated sec of 2 7 kj mol reale et al 2019 while the 5 3 mg cm2 electrodes sharing the same composition have an initial sec of 3 04 kj mol as the present system reached the limit of salt removal due to the mixing of diluate and brine further cycling consumed significantly more energy causing sec to rise steeply while salt removal stagnated because all experiments used the same flow rate and current density the average salt absorption rate asar was initially 0 55 0 6 µmol cm2 min for all three experiments asar declines with the mixing effect decreasing removal each cycle becoming 0 51 µmol cm2 min on average when the experiment with 11 1 mg cm2 electrodes concluded at the highest salt removal with 100 mm influent the thermodynamic energy efficiency tee of the recirculating cell defined as tee se c min sec was 50 but tee reached as high as 80 for the densest electrodes before mixing outweighed the electrodes ability to remove salt in a single cycle fig 5c one reason for the high tee is the high salt removal shown in fig 5a where sec for all three electrodes increases linearly with salt removal during early cycles at low salt removal the thermodynamic minimum is low compared to the experimental secs but as both experimental and theoretical secs increase the ratio between them increases as well the present 100 mm influent is more ionically conductive than the 20 50 mm influents used in other studies and the denser highly conductive electrodes created here consume less energy due to smaller ohmic losses that we show subsequently it should also be noted that the cell operated at only 1 ma cm2 and sec for similar electrodes increased approximately linearly with current density in our past work reale et al 2019 while such results demonstrate the practical benefits of high areal loading for increased desalination performance inspection of specific capacity attained from cycle to cycle revealed trends suggesting further room for improvement fig 6 a shows that utilization of charge capacity declined with increasing salt removal though high areal capacity electrodes retain the most capacity when comparing the 8 7 mg cm2 and 11 1 mg cm2 electrodes the former electrodes only utilize 45 of their capacity at 80 salt removal while at the same salt removal the latter electrodes retained 87 utilization this outcome is likely a result of high areal capacity electrodes producing greater flow efficiency defined as the ratio between time for the electrodes porous volume to be replaced and the charging time hawks et al 2018 because denser electrodes have smaller pore volume feedwater is removed fast enough to supply fresh sodium ions for intercalation into pba particles and between the lowest and highest areal loadings flow efficiency increases by 30 the specific capacity of electrodes during experiments with 200 mm remained high even when the cell reached the limits of its salt removal due to abundant sodium in solution though the flow rate was four times higher than what our single pass experiments previously used reale et al 2019 0 25 ml min decreasing charge capacity at high salt removal suggests that gradients of salt concentration and pba state of charge decrease utilization however the disparate concentrations of salt in diluate and brine streams near the end of a recirculating fdi process are also expected to produce concentration polarization and ohmic polarization limiting capacity when performing galvanostatic cycling within a finite cell voltage window the inability of such a system to continue removing salt also causes charge efficiency to decline during later charge discharge cycles fig 6b eventually reaching zero salt removal at a certain cycle number during either the pc or nc period of each half cycle we observed that charge efficiency remained at 80 95 but cumulative charge efficiency approached zero at later half cycles due to effluent mixing counteracting salt removal during valve switching events occuring during oc periods to analyze the influence of cell impedance on desalination performance we conducted electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis during the oc periods of each cycle fig 7 a these spectra show that real impedance at high frequency gradually increases from cycle to cycle as a result of one side of the cell becoming less ionically conductive during salt removal this effect is evidenced by the voltage versus capacity curves measured during pc and nc cycling fig 7b where increased polarization pushes average cell voltage nearer to the edges of the voltage window within which cycling occurs from the initial cycle to the final cycle the degree of polarization increase differs with each type of electrode and the final salt removal attained however polarization is largest during cycles with highest salt removal and when real impedance at high frequency is largest in fig 7a electrodes with 5 3 mg cm2 show little change in real impedance between the first and final cycles despite attaining 65 salt removal however real impedance at high frequency in the denser electrodes increased more than two fold this limited change of impedance for electrodes with lower areal capacity can be understood by assuming that ionic conductivity is directly proportional to salt concentration eq 1 shows the theoretical ratio between ionic resistance at a certain degree of salt removal in mm r ion δ c c i c d and the initial resistance when both anode and cathode contain influent of the same concentration 1 r ion δ c r ion δ c 0 1 2 1 1 δ c c i 1 1 δ c c i this simple relation reveals that only at 71 mm of salt removal from 100 mm does the theoretical ionic resistance double furthermore ionic resistance within electrodes is only one source of impedance including electronic resistance warburg impedance aem impedance and contact resistance in external circuitry the minor influence of salt concentration on impedance is further demonstrated in si fig s6 and section s2 in any case fig 7b shows that increasing impedance with increasing salt removal results in increased polarization average voltage during the first and final half cycles increased from 0 07 v to 0 29 v as the 11 1 mg pba cm2 achieved 90 salt removal lowering utilization and limiting maximum salt removal the calendering of electrodes is therefore shown to increase electronic conductivity and reduce ohmic energy losses keeping energy consumption low at high salt removal finally table 1 compares energy consumption achieved recently in fdi using symmetric electrode architectures as each work tested an fdi system at different current densities and flow rates the values shown are for the highest salt removal achieved the present results show slightly higher asar than most cases and achieved an excellent 90 salt removal a higher fraction than any other listed however the sec of 10 9 kj mol acheived at this exceptional salt removal level is high due to effluent mixing however at 80 salt removal an sec of 5 7 kj mol was achieved approaching the thermodynamic minimum energy of 4 5 kj mol for that salt removal level and reaching an exceptional thermodynamic energy efficiency of 80 4 conclusions in this work a recirculating flow through faradaic deionization apparatus was demonstrated and shown to produce 90 salt removed from one reservoir of 100 mm aqueous nacl transferring the salt into a second reservoir of brine with 50 water recovery rate in the same experiment 80 salt removal was achieved with a thermodynamic energy efficiency of 80 it was shown that recirculating cell performance is limited by diluate and brine mixing during valve switching processes the effects of which were minimized through the use of an open circuit period during which the inlet and outlet valves were switched at different times such pause periods improved desalination performance however they could not totally eliminate mixing effects resulting in an upper limit for salt removal and a lower limit for specific energy consumption that is highest for porous electrodes with high areal capacity and low porosity we showed this by fabricating electrodes using a novel wet phase inversion process incorporating a heated alkaline water bath for the first time to solidify electrodes with high areal capacity that were subsequently calendered to achieve simultaneously low porosity impedance spectra measured during the open circuit periods of fdi cycling showed that the electronic resistance of electrodes was reduced by their calendering and flooded cell experiments showed better utilization despite the significant improvements demonstrated relative to prior work limitations other than electrode areal capacity make further increases in salt removal unattainable for the current cell even with the present recirculating apparatus reducing the ratio of internal fluid volume within flow passages to the pore volume of electrodes is likely to lead to further improvements in desalination performance further decreasing the effect of mixing between brine and diluate streams however the degree of apparent mixing is likely to include the effects of diffusion and dispersion at interfaces between diluate and brine streams the present results show significant pumping power requirements approximately 0 12 kwh m3 for the densest electrodes during each pass of water over the complete desalination process this energy consumption is multiplied by over 50 fold due to the same fluid being recirculated making pumping energy exceed the electrical energy by an order of magnitude thus pumping power should be targeted as another area for improving fdi performance in particular when using flow through electrodes these results motivate other approaches to minimize losses that arise due to such effects including scale up of the fdi cell the current fdi cell possesses pore volume when incorporating the lowest porosity electrodes tested 67 that is 70 of the total volume within tubing and manifold supplying influent to the electrodes an fdi cell with increased capacity constructed using more electrode area with similar areal capacity would increase total electrode pore volume in proportion to cell capacity while holding tube volume constant declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

19938,reuse of wastewater effluent and biosolids in agriculture is essential to sustainable water and nutrient resource management practices wastewater and biosolids however are reportedly the recipients reservoirs and sources of antibiotic resistant enteric pathogens while decay rates of fecal bacterial indicators in soil are frequently studied very few studies have reported on the persistence of the antibiotic resistant sub populations little is known about how multi drug resistance phenotypes of enteric bacteria in agricultural soil change over time in this study germinated carrot seeds were planted in soil that received biosolids amendment and or wastewater effluent irrigation in a greenhouse setting we quantified total and antibiotic resistant fecal bacterial indicators escherichia coli and enterococci weekly in soil and total e coli at harvest day 77 on carrots antibiotic susceptibility of 121 e coli and 110 enterococci collected isolates were determined e coli or enterococci were not recovered from the soil without biosolids amendment regardless of the irrigation water source after biosolids amendment soil e coli and enterococci concentrations increased more than 3 log10 cfu g ts within the first week declined slowly over time but stayed above the detection limit 0 39 cfu g ts over the entirety of the study no statistical difference was found between effluent wastewater or water irrigation in soil total and antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci concentrations or carrots e coli levels soil antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci decayed significantly faster than total e coli and enterococci moreover the prevalence of multi drug resistant resistance to three or more antibiotics e coli declined significantly over time while almost all collected enterococci isolates showed multi drug resistance phenotypes at harvest e coli were present on carrots the majority of which were resistant to ampicillin the survival of antibiotic resistant enteric bacteria in soil and on harvested carrots indicates there are transmission risks associated with biosolids amendment use in root crops graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance biosolids amendment wastewater irrigation escherichia coli enterococci 1 introduction the world s population is expected to reach nearly 10 billion by the year 2050 requiring an increase in agricultural production of over 60 from 2005 united nations 2019 to keep up with this rise in global food demand the use of treated wastewater effluent twe for irrigation as an alternative water resource and animal or human excreta i e manure or biosolids as soil amendments is increasing one of the main human health risks associated with the application of wastewater effluent and biosolids in agriculture is the potential contamination of food crops with infectious enteric bacteria in addition to their infectivity the emergence of enteric bacteria resistant to one or more antibiotics in municipal wastewater and biosolids and consequently their receiving environments is a growing human health concern e u commission 2017 each year in the u s alone there are 2 8 million infections with antibiotic resistant bacteria arb with 35 000 deaths as a direct result of these infections cdc 2019 the human health impacts of the presence and dissemination of enteric arb in the environment are not well defined consequently the microbial regulations which exist for agricultural use of twe and biosolids to protect human welfare may be insufficient to mitigate the risk associated with antibiotic resistance in agricultural systems identifying the exposure risks of antibiotic resistance due to wastewater and biosolids application in agriculture is essential to food safety and human health ashbolt et al 2013 significant levels of arb are present in both biosolids 5 11 log10 cfu g and twe 0 7 4 log10 cfu ml even after the use of advanced treatment technologies such as membrane bioreactors or anaerobic digesters guardabassi et al 2002 munir et al 2011 novo et al 2013 smyth et al 2020 the subsequent use of these arb laden resources in agricultural settings has raised concerns about their safety christou et al 2017 michael et al 2013 some studies on the prevalence of arb on food crops grown in amended soil or irrigated with twe have not detected their presence rahube et al 2014 while others report arb and their determinant genes on food crops marti et al 2013 micallef et al 2013 yet there is limited knowledge on the fate prevalence growth and persistence of enteric arb in soil and on food crops moreover the potential changes in phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility profile of these resistance bacteria after biosolids amendment and or continued twe irrigation is not clearly understood the risk of exposure to enteric arb and multi drug resistance i e resistant to three or more classes of antibiotics mdr bacteria as food moves from the farm to the table and the subsequent clinical impact on increased illness disability and death demonstrate the need to determine the survival of enteric arb and their non arb counterparts in soil environments in this work we aim to determine the fate of antibiotic resistant fecal indicator bacteria and the change in their phenotypic characterization over time in agricultural soil after biosolids amendment and or twe irrigation to achieve these objectives different combinations of biosolids amendment and twe irrigation were applied to soil in a controlled greenhouse setting during carrot production i e eleven weeks cultivatable total and antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci gram negative and gram positive fecal bacterial indicators were quantified in biosolids and twe and tracked weekly in soil declining populations of arb versus susceptible counterparts were determined and the presence of e coli on carrot skins at harvest was measured finally the phenotypes of antibiotic susceptibility of presumptive e coli and enterococci colonies and the prevalence of mdr enteric bacterial indicators over the growing period were identified 2 methods 2 1 greenhouse study design this study was conducted in a greenhouse at oregon state university corvallis or between february and may 2019 the greenhouse consisted of 1 5 m 4 5 m steel mesh grid tables on which 1 2 m 1 2 m growth trays were placed to collect and contain any runoff polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe cages with mosquito netting were constructed around each tray to prevent flying insects from accessing the plants and soil in the greenhouse the ambient temperature was maintained at approximately 15 c overnight and fluctuated between 20 c and 26 c during the daylight hours soil was obtained from a commercial agricultural field from the willamette valley area in oregon with no history of wastewater irrigation or biosolids manure amendment the collected soil was air dried and passed through a 5 mm sieve the study design included four treatment groups consisting of soil with or without biosolids amendment that were irrigated with twe or deionized di water there were six replicate pots in each treatment group that were randomly assigned to two groups triplicates on each sampling day we rotated between the two groups for testing plastic nursery containers 7 5 l were filled with approximately 5 8 kg of soil pots in the biosolids amendment treatment groups were amended with dewatered biosolids at a ratio of 70 g kg of soil 1 dry w w the day prior to planting carrot seeds were obtained from a local farm and were germinated by keeping them in moist paper towels at room temperature for 12 d four germinated seeds were sown into each pot pots were irrigated with twe or di water 2 to 3 times per week irrigation water was applied to maintain a soil moisture content of 80 85 total solids 150 500 ml adjusted for measured solids content and to minimize the draining of water from the bottom of the pots 2 2 collection and storage of biosolids effluent soil and carrots municipal biosolids and twe were collected from a local water reclamation facility in oregon this facility receives municipal wastewater from a serving population of approximately 55 000 with average daily flow rates of 8 10 million gal treatment methods include a traditional activated sludge basin secondary clarifiers and chlorination by sodium hypochlorite settled sludge enters a holding tank prior to dewatering via belt press dewatered class b biosolids were

for ph total solids and bacterial enumeration within 24 h after 11 weeks 77 d carrots were harvested from pots to harvest the entirety of the pot contents was gently removed and placed into a containment bin bulk soil was brushed aside until carrots could be removed carrot tops were removed using sterile scissors and the carrots from each pot were then placed into a bag the carrot roots were stored at 4 c and processed for bacterial enumeration within 24 h 2 3 physical and chemical parameters soil total solids were measured on each sampling day following the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 2540b apha et al 2017 soil ph was measured biweekly by mixing bulk soil and di water at a ratio of 1 9 the mixture was stirred for 5 min before measurement using a ph probe vwr radnor pa 2 4 bacterial enumeration and isolation initial biosolids and weekly soil samples were mixed 1 1 with phosphate buffered saline pbs shaken for 2 min and allowed to settle for an

total and antibiotic resistant bacteria in irrigated biosolids amended soil the abundance of culturable total and antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci was quantified in irrigated biosolid amended soil over a 77 day period fig 3 biosolids amendment increased both e coli and enterococci levels in soil to 3 6 0 2 log10 cfu g ts these e coli and enterococci levels in soil i e after biosolids amendment were about 1 log10 cfu g ts lower than predicted which is potentially due to the 24 hour period between sample collection and processing on day 0 an increase of 0 58 log10 cfu g ts was observed in twe irrigated pots fig 3b and 0 23 log10 cfu g ts in di irrigated pots fig 3a at day 7 after which total e coli levels decreased slowly but remained above the detection limit 0 39 log10 cfu g ts over the entirety of the study results demonstrated that a large portion of e coli detected in biosolids amended soil were resistant to ampicillin and that they survived in soil for the first four weeks of the study but declined to below the limit of detection by week eight resistance of e coli to tetracycline and ciprofloxacin were present at around 2 log10 cfu g ts in amended soil but declined quickly and were below the detection limit by day 21 enterococci levels slightly increased to 3 98 log10 cfu g ts in twe irrigated soil by day 7 followed by a slow decline over time fig 3d enterococci concentrations fluctuated between the detection limit and 1 0 log10 cfu g ts from day 63 until the end of the study compared to e coli enterococci were more adept at surviving in the biosolids amended twe irrigated soil environment ampicillin resistant enterococci followed a similar pattern increasing from an initial concentration of 2 89 log10 cfu g ts in the biosolids amended soil to 3 21 log10 cfu g ts and 3 39 log10 cfu g ts in di and twe irrigated soil on day 7 respectively followed by a decline over the next 3 weeks ampicillin resistant enterococci declined to the detection limit by day 28 and tetracycline resistant enterococci declined to similar levels by day 56 background soil was verified to have no detectable total or antibiotic resistant e coli or enterococci 0 39 log10 cfu g ts samples without biosolids amendment that were irrigated with di water controls had no detectable e coli nor enterococci throughout the course of the study in the pots without biosolids amendment that received twe irrigation total and ampicillin resistant e coli were detected at 0 74 log10 cfu g ts on day 14 and the levels were below the detection limit 0 39 log10 cfu g ts for the remainder of the study hence no significant difference was observed on the prevalence of total or antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci in unamended soil irrigated with di water and twe kruskal wallis p 0 05 no statistical difference was observed between the concentrations of e coli and enterococci throughout the study period kruskal wallis p 0 05 fig 3 suggesting these two fecal indicators behave similarly in soil the antibiotic resistant subpopulations decayed at faster rates than their total counterparts for both e coli and enterococci tetracycline resistant e coli decayed at a faster rate compared to total and ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistant e coli similarly tetracycline and ampicillin resistant enterococci declined faster than total enterococci populations overall while total and antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci levels declined rapidly in soil our findings demonstrate that antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci declined at a faster rate than the total counterparts to the authors knowledge this study is the first to directly compare declining populations of total and antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci in soil receiving biosolids amendment and or twe irrigation our findings are in line with a study tracking e coli in dewatered anaerobically digested sludge amended soil lang and smith 2007 other studies of biosolids and animal manure amended soils have reported a comparable microbial decline lang et al 2007 schwarz et al 2014 the complex nature of the interactions between the soil environment and parameters such as moisture content temperature ph availability of resources e g oxygen carbon physical characteristics of soil e g proportions of silt and clay soil microbiota that affect growth and survival of total and antibiotic resistant enteric bacteria can account for these differences montealegre et al 2018 navab daneshmand et al 2014 van elsas et al 2011 moreover while continuous decline of the soil total and antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci were observed the transfer of resistance to other bacterial species via mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer should also be considered rahube et al 2016 riber et al 2014 future research could include investigations into whether arb decay at faster rates due to decreased environmental fitness or due to disposal of the resistance genes on mobile genetic elements into the surrounding environment 3 4 survival of total e coli on carrots grown in irrigated biosolids amended soil e coli concentrations were measured on carrots at harvest these levels were below the limit of detection 0 log10 cfu 10 ml rinsate on carrots grown in soil without biosolids amendment in carrots harvested from biosolids amended treatment groups e coli concentrations were 1 0 0 2 log10 cfu 40 ml rinsate under di water irrigation and 0 8 0 2 log10 cfu 40 ml rinsate under twe irrigation similar to soil data no statistical difference was found between the two irrigation patterns one way anova p 0 05 other studies tracking bacterial pathogen indicators in biosolids amended soil have found varying results on their presence on vegetable crops at harvest some studies have shown that e coli can survive in soil for lengthy time periods and can be present on the food crops at harvest islam et al 2004 others have not found significant evidence that biosolids amendment increases the abundance of e coli or enterococci on vegetables at harvest rahube et al 2014 the time between the amendment and harvest appears to be a strong determinate of the survival of pathogenic bacterial indicators on crops as has been previously reported in literature and is regulated by governing bodies food and drug administration 2015 gale 2005 u

the right environmental conditions fecal indicators such as e coli and enterococci may persist for several months in the soil environment emch et al 2020 lang and smith 2007 schwarz et al 2014 3 5 antibiotic susceptibility profile of isolates a total of 107 presumptive e coli and 110 presumptive enterococci colonies were collected from biosolids amended soil over the course of the study days 0 35 and 77 and 14 presumptive e coli colonies from carrots at harvest day 77 data from the antibiotic susceptibility testing of the colonies are shown in table 1 isolates showed resistance to between zero and all five antibiotics tested of the e coli and enterococci colonies collected from antibiotic supplemented plates the majority n 168 179 demonstrated resistance against the respective antibiotics during antibiotic susceptibility testing table 1 however 10 9 n 10 92 of colonies collected from ampicillin supplemented plates and 1 1 n 1 87 of colonies collected from tetracycline supplemented plates later showed susceptibility to ampicillin and tetracycline disks respectively this loss in resistance specifically for ampicillin has been reported previously as well palacios et al 2017 loss of resistance can occur by a number of factors particularly if the mechanism comes with a high fitness cost by growing isolated colonies in a nutrient rich broth such as mueller hinton without selective pressure it is plausible that ampicillin or tetracycline resistant populations were displaced by susceptible counterparts andersson and hughes 2011 mdr phenotype was defined as resistance to three or more antibiotics percentages of mdr e coli and enterococci colonies as well as those resistant to none antibiotic susceptible one or two antibiotics during the eleven week study are shown in fig 4 56 9 n 37 65 of e coli colonies collected at the beginning of the study were determined as mdr since no culturable e coli were observed in non amended soils presumptive e coli isolated from amended soil are most likely from biosolids on day 35 22 9 n 8 35 of e coli colonies isolated from biosolids amended soil were mdr of the 22 e coli isolated at harvest in soil and on carrots none harbored mdr the decrease in the prevalence of mdr e coli between the three sampling periods from the beginning of the study to harvest was statistically significant pearson s chi squared p 0 001 fig 4 all identified mdr phenotypes are listed in table s1 with concurrent resistance to ampicillin trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline accounting for 53 3 of mdr e coli isolates amongst the 45 total e coli isolates that harbored mdr 91 1 n 41 were resistant to tetracycline similarly 80 0 n 36 71 1 n 32 62 2 n 28 44 4 n 20 and 26 7 n 12 of mdr e coli isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin ampicillin trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole chloramphenicol and gentamycin respectively for enterococci colonies the prevalence of mdr phenotypes were relatively consistent between day 0 and day 35 fisher s exact p 0 05 and almost all enterococci demonstrated mdr phenotype n 64 70 on day 0 and n 40 40 on day 35 no culturable antibiotic resistant enterococci were present in soil at harvest all the 110 enterococci mdr isolates demonstrated resistance to ciprofloxacin and 98 1 n 102 90 4 n 94 64 4 n 67 and 47 1 n 49 harbored resistance to erythromycin tetracycline ampicillin and vancomycin the most concurrent mdr phenotypes were resistance to ciprofloxacin erythromycin and tetracycline in 88 5 and to ampicillin ciprofloxacin erythromycin and tetracycline in 55 8 of the mdr enterococcus isolates table s1 overall our study demonstrates that wastewater effluent irrigation does not impact e coli and enterococci levels in soil and on carrots amendment of class b biosolids however significantly increased e coli and enterococci concentrations in amended soil almost all e coli were resistant to ampicillin in the beginning of the study and declined quickly to below detection by week seven antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci decayed at significantly faster rates than total counterparts e coli were present on carrots at harvest the majority of which were resistant to ampicillin prevalence of mdr e coli declined significantly over time while mdr enterococci persisted since no culturable e coli or enterococci were observed in non amended soils antibiotic resistant phenotypes observed in amended soil are most likely from biosolids this work is the first to directly compare declining populations of total and antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci and the persistence of mdr phenotypes of these enteric bacterial indicators in soils after biosolids amendment and wastewater irrigation findings allow for cautious optimism that use of wastewater effluent would not significantly increase antibiotic resistant enteric bacteria in soil the survival of fecal indicator bacteria in soil and on harvested carrots however indicates the transmission risks associated with biosolids amendment to harvested root crops the difference in mdr patterns between e coli and enterococci encourages the need for additional studies on the topic use of culture based methods in this study is useful in identifying and quantifying fecal indicator bacteria that actively expressed resistance to the target antibiotics the limitation of this approach is in the number and types of cultivatable bacteria and target antibiotics moreover the application of culture based methods does not include antibiotic resistant bacteria that are viable but non culturable i e bacteria in vbnc state combining culture dependent and culture independent methods are needed to give further insight to the fate of enteric arbs and their expression of mdr conclusions environmental pollution by antibiotics and arb is a growing concern as reuse of municipal biosolids and wastewater in agriculture climbs due to shortages of water valuable nutrients results of this study revealed that biosolids amendment in soil contributes to significant increases of total and antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci at the time of application however these levels decrease naturally over time twe irrigation did not impact abundance of these bacteria in soil under our study conditions nor did it affect prevalence of mdr isolates in biosolids amended soil total e coli and enterococci persisted in soil for the duration of study 77 days growth season of carrots and e coli was present on carrots at harvest antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci decayed faster than total bacterial counterparts and reached the limit of detection before the end of the study prevalence of mdr e coli declined significantly over time while low levels of mdr enterococci persisted the survival of bacteria in soil and on carrots after biosolids amendment indicates a low level of transmission risk from harvested crops declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

the year 2050 requiring an increase in agricultural production of over 60 from 2005 united nations 2019 to keep up with this rise in global food demand the use of treated wastewater effluent twe for irrigation as an alternative water resource and animal or human excreta i e manure or biosolids as soil amendments is increasing one of the main human health risks associated with the application of wastewater effluent and biosolids in agriculture is the potential contamination of food crops with infectious enteric bacteria in addition to their infectivity the emergence of enteric bacteria resistant to one or more antibiotics in municipal wastewater and biosolids and consequently their receiving environments is a growing human health concern e u commission 2017 each year in the u s alone there are 2 8 million infections with antibiotic resistant bacteria arb with 35 000 deaths as a direct result of these infections cdc 2019 the human health impacts of the presence and dissemination of enteric arb in the environment are not well defined consequently the microbial regulations which exist for agricultural use of twe and biosolids to protect human welfare may be insufficient to mitigate the risk associated with antibiotic resistance in agricultural systems identifying the exposure risks of antibiotic resistance due to wastewater and biosolids application in agriculture is essential to food safety and human health ashbolt et al 2013 significant levels of arb are present in both biosolids 5 11 log10 cfu g and twe 0 7 4 log10 cfu ml even after the use of advanced treatment technologies such as membrane bioreactors or anaerobic digesters guardabassi et al 2002 munir et al 2011 novo et al 2013 smyth et al 2020 the subsequent use of these arb laden resources in agricultural settings has raised concerns about their safety christou et al 2017 michael et al 2013 some studies on the prevalence of arb on food crops grown in amended soil or irrigated with twe have not detected their presence rahube et al 2014 while others report arb and their determinant genes on food crops marti et al 2013 micallef et al 2013 yet there is limited knowledge on the fate prevalence growth and persistence of enteric arb in soil and on food crops moreover the potential changes in phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility profile of these resistance bacteria after biosolids amendment and or continued twe irrigation is not clearly understood the risk of exposure to enteric arb and multi drug resistance i e resistant to three or more classes of antibiotics mdr bacteria as food moves from the farm to the table and the subsequent clinical impact on increased illness disability and death demonstrate the need to determine the survival of enteric arb and their non arb counterparts in soil environments in this work we aim to determine the fate of antibiotic resistant fecal indicator bacteria and the change in their phenotypic characterization over time in agricultural soil after biosolids amendment and or twe irrigation to achieve these objectives different combinations of biosolids amendment and twe irrigation were applied to soil in a controlled greenhouse setting during carrot production i e eleven weeks cultivatable total and antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci gram negative and gram positive fecal bacterial indicators were quantified in biosolids and twe and tracked weekly in soil declining populations of arb versus susceptible counterparts were determined and the presence of e coli on carrot skins at harvest was measured finally the phenotypes of antibiotic susceptibility of presumptive e coli and enterococci colonies and the prevalence of mdr enteric bacterial indicators over the growing period were identified 2 methods 2 1 greenhouse study design this study was conducted in a greenhouse at oregon state university corvallis or between february and may 2019 the greenhouse consisted of 1 5 m 4 5 m steel mesh grid tables on which 1 2 m 1 2 m growth trays were placed to collect and contain any runoff polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe cages with mosquito netting were constructed around each tray to prevent flying insects from accessing the plants and soil in the greenhouse the ambient temperature was maintained at approximately 15 c overnight and fluctuated between 20 c and 26 c during the daylight hours soil was obtained from a commercial agricultural field from the willamette valley area in oregon with no history of wastewater irrigation or biosolids manure amendment the collected soil was air dried and passed through a 5 mm sieve the study design included four treatment groups consisting of soil with or without biosolids amendment that were irrigated with twe or deionized di water there were six replicate pots in each treatment group that were randomly assigned to two groups triplicates on each sampling day we rotated between the two groups for testing plastic nursery containers 7 5 l were filled with approximately 5 8 kg of soil pots in the biosolids amendment treatment groups were amended with dewatered biosolids at a ratio of 70 g kg of soil 1 dry w w the day prior to planting carrot seeds were obtained from a local farm and were germinated by keeping them in moist paper towels at room temperature for 12 d four germinated seeds were sown into each pot pots were irrigated with twe or di water 2 to 3 times per week irrigation water was applied to maintain a soil moisture content of 80 85 total solids 150 500 ml adjusted for measured solids content and to minimize the draining of water from the bottom of the pots 2 2 collection and storage of biosolids effluent soil and carrots municipal biosolids and twe were collected from a local water reclamation facility in oregon this facility receives municipal wastewater from a serving population of approximately 55 000 with average daily flow rates of 8 10 million gal treatment methods include a traditional activated sludge basin secondary clarifiers and chlorination by sodium hypochlorite settled sludge enters a holding tank prior to dewatering via belt press dewatered class b biosolids were collected in the beginning of the study transferred to the laboratory on ice upon arrival to the laboratory the collected biosolids were processed for ph total solids and bacterial enumerations

prior to discharge transferred to the laboratory on ice and stored at 4 c for up to 7 d before use each week soil core samples were collected in triplicate before irrigation soil cores were collected from bulk soil defined as soil not penetrated by plant roots from the soil surface to an approximate depth of 25 cm using a soil sampler probe m k rittenhouse sons ltd st catharines ontario canada to account for the possibility of vertical bacterial migration on day 0 soil samples were collected after all pots were filled with appropriate soil and biosolids amendment all soil samples were collected prior to irrigation collected soil was placed into a sterile whirlpak bag nasco fort atkinson wi and homogenized by massaging and shaking for 2 min soil bags were stored on ice and processed for ph total solids and bacterial enumeration within 24 h after 11 weeks 77 d carrots were harvested from pots to harvest the entirety of the pot contents was gently removed and placed into a containment bin bulk soil was brushed aside until carrots could be removed carrot tops were removed using sterile scissors and the carrots from each pot were then placed into a bag the carrot roots were stored at 4 c and processed for bacterial enumeration within 24 h 2 3 physical and chemical parameters soil total solids were measured on each sampling day following the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 2540b apha et al 2017 soil ph was measured biweekly by mixing bulk soil and di water at a ratio of 1 9 the mixture was stirred for 5 min before measurement using a ph probe vwr radnor pa 2 4 bacterial enumeration and isolation initial biosolids and weekly soil samples were mixed 1 1 with phosphate buffered saline pbs shaken for 2 min and allowed to settle for an additional 2 min prior to preparing serial dilutions in pbs carrot samples were rinsed with 40 ml pbs by shaking and were subsequently massaged for 60 s soil supernatant and carrot rinsate were spread plated onto prepared agar plates additionally aliquots of soil dilutions 1 ml carrot rinsate 10 ml and twe 200 ml were filtered through 0 45 µm mixed cellulose ester membranes whatman kent uk and the

total and antibiotic resistant bacteria in irrigated biosolids amended soil the abundance of culturable total and antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci was quantified in irrigated biosolid amended soil over a 77 day period fig 3 biosolids amendment increased both e coli and enterococci levels in soil to 3 6 0 2 log10 cfu g ts these e coli and enterococci levels in soil i e after biosolids amendment were about 1 log10 cfu g ts lower than predicted which is potentially due to the 24 hour period between sample collection and processing on day 0 an increase of 0 58 log10 cfu g ts was observed in twe irrigated pots fig 3b and 0 23 log10 cfu g ts in di irrigated pots fig 3a at day 7 after which total e coli levels decreased slowly but remained above the detection limit 0 39 log10 cfu g ts over the entirety of the study results demonstrated that a large portion of e coli detected in biosolids amended soil were resistant to ampicillin and that they survived in soil for the first four weeks of the study but declined to below the limit of detection by week eight resistance of e coli to tetracycline and ciprofloxacin were present at around 2 log10 cfu g ts in amended soil but declined quickly and were below the detection limit by day 21 enterococci levels slightly increased to 3 98 log10 cfu g ts in twe irrigated soil by day 7 followed by a slow decline over time fig 3d enterococci concentrations fluctuated between the detection limit and 1 0 log10 cfu g ts from day 63 until the end of the study compared to e coli enterococci were more adept at surviving in the biosolids amended twe irrigated soil environment ampicillin resistant enterococci followed a similar pattern increasing from an initial concentration of 2 89 log10 cfu g ts in the biosolids amended soil to 3 21 log10 cfu g ts and 3 39 log10 cfu g ts in di and twe irrigated soil on day 7 respectively followed by a decline over the next 3 weeks ampicillin resistant enterococci declined to the detection limit by day 28 and tetracycline resistant enterococci declined to similar levels by day 56 background soil was verified to have no detectable total or antibiotic resistant e coli or enterococci 0 39 log10 cfu g ts samples without biosolids amendment that were irrigated with di water controls had no detectable e coli nor enterococci throughout the course of the study in the pots without biosolids amendment that received twe irrigation total and ampicillin resistant e coli were detected at 0 74 log10 cfu g ts on day 14 and the levels were below the detection limit 0 39 log10 cfu g ts for the remainder of the study hence no significant difference was observed on the prevalence of total or antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci in unamended soil irrigated with di water and twe kruskal wallis p 0 05 no statistical difference was observed between the concentrations of e coli and enterococci throughout the study period kruskal wallis p 0 05 fig 3 suggesting these two fecal indicators behave similarly in soil the antibiotic resistant subpopulations decayed at faster rates than their total counterparts for both e coli and enterococci tetracycline resistant e coli decayed at a faster rate compared to total and ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistant e coli similarly tetracycline and ampicillin resistant enterococci declined faster than total enterococci populations overall while total and antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci levels declined rapidly in soil our findings demonstrate that antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci declined at a faster rate than the total counterparts to the authors knowledge this study is the first to directly compare declining populations of total and antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci in soil receiving biosolids amendment and or twe irrigation our findings are in line with a study tracking e coli in dewatered anaerobically digested sludge amended soil lang and smith 2007 other studies of biosolids and animal manure amended soils have reported a comparable microbial decline lang et al 2007 schwarz et al 2014 the complex nature of the interactions between the soil environment and parameters such as moisture content temperature ph availability of resources e g oxygen carbon physical characteristics of soil e g proportions of silt and clay soil microbiota that affect growth and survival of total and antibiotic resistant enteric bacteria can account for these differences montealegre et al 2018 navab daneshmand et al 2014 van elsas et al 2011 moreover while continuous decline of the soil total and antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci were observed the transfer of resistance to other bacterial species via mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer should also be considered rahube et al 2016 riber et al 2014 future research could include investigations into whether arb decay at faster rates due to decreased environmental fitness or due to disposal of the resistance genes on mobile genetic elements into the surrounding environment 3 4 survival of total e coli on carrots grown in irrigated biosolids amended soil e coli concentrations were measured on carrots at harvest these levels were below the limit of detection 0 log10 cfu 10 ml rinsate on carrots grown in soil without biosolids amendment in carrots harvested from biosolids amended treatment groups e coli concentrations were 1 0 0 2 log10 cfu 40 ml rinsate under di water irrigation and 0 8 0 2 log10 cfu 40 ml rinsate under twe irrigation similar to soil data no statistical difference was found between the two irrigation patterns one way anova p 0 05 other studies tracking bacterial pathogen indicators in biosolids amended soil have found varying results on their presence on vegetable crops at harvest some studies have shown that e coli can survive in soil for lengthy time periods and can be present on the food crops at harvest islam et al 2004 others have not found significant evidence that biosolids amendment increases the abundance of e coli or enterococci on vegetables at harvest rahube et al 2014 the time between the amendment and harvest appears to be a strong determinate of the survival of pathogenic bacterial indicators on crops as has been previously reported in literature and is regulated by governing bodies food and drug administration 2015 gale 2005 u

the right environmental conditions fecal indicators such as e coli and enterococci may persist for several months in the soil environment emch et al 2020 lang and smith 2007 schwarz et al 2014 3 5 antibiotic susceptibility profile of isolates a total of 107 presumptive e coli and 110 presumptive enterococci colonies were collected from biosolids amended soil over the course of the study days 0 35 and 77 and 14 presumptive e coli colonies from carrots at harvest day 77 data from the antibiotic susceptibility testing of the colonies are shown in table 1 isolates showed resistance to between zero and all five antibiotics tested of the e coli and enterococci colonies collected from antibiotic supplemented plates the majority n 168 179 demonstrated resistance against the respective antibiotics during antibiotic susceptibility testing table 1 however 10 9 n 10 92 of colonies collected from ampicillin supplemented plates and 1 1 n 1 87 of colonies collected from tetracycline supplemented plates later showed susceptibility to ampicillin and tetracycline disks respectively this loss in resistance specifically for ampicillin has been reported previously as well palacios et al 2017 loss of resistance can occur by a number of factors particularly if the mechanism comes with a high fitness cost by growing isolated colonies in a nutrient rich broth such as mueller hinton without selective pressure it is plausible that ampicillin or tetracycline resistant populations were displaced by susceptible counterparts andersson and hughes 2011 mdr phenotype was defined as resistance to three or more antibiotics percentages of mdr e coli and enterococci colonies as well as those resistant to none antibiotic susceptible one or two antibiotics during the eleven week study are shown in fig 4 56 9 n 37 65 of e coli colonies collected at the beginning of the study were determined as mdr since no culturable e coli were observed in non amended soils presumptive e coli isolated from amended soil are most likely from biosolids on day 35 22 9 n 8 35 of e coli colonies isolated from biosolids amended soil were mdr of the 22 e coli isolated at harvest in soil and on carrots none harbored mdr the decrease in the prevalence of mdr e coli between the three sampling periods from the beginning of the study to harvest was statistically significant pearson s chi squared p 0 001 fig 4 all identified mdr phenotypes are listed in table s1 with concurrent resistance to ampicillin trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline accounting for 53 3 of mdr e coli isolates amongst the 45 total e coli isolates that harbored mdr 91 1 n 41 were resistant to tetracycline similarly 80 0 n 36 71 1 n 32 62 2 n 28 44 4 n 20 and 26 7 n 12 of mdr e coli isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin ampicillin trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole chloramphenicol and gentamycin respectively for enterococci colonies the prevalence of mdr phenotypes were relatively consistent between day 0 and day 35 fisher s exact p 0 05 and almost all enterococci demonstrated mdr phenotype n 64 70 on day 0 and n 40 40 on day 35 no culturable antibiotic resistant enterococci were present in soil at harvest all the 110 enterococci mdr isolates demonstrated resistance to ciprofloxacin and 98 1 n 102 90 4 n 94 64 4 n 67 and 47 1 n 49 harbored resistance to erythromycin tetracycline ampicillin and vancomycin the most concurrent mdr phenotypes were resistance to ciprofloxacin erythromycin and tetracycline in 88 5 and to ampicillin ciprofloxacin erythromycin and tetracycline in 55 8 of the mdr enterococcus isolates table s1 overall our study demonstrates that wastewater effluent irrigation does not impact e coli and enterococci levels in soil and on carrots amendment of class b biosolids however significantly increased e coli and enterococci concentrations in amended soil almost all e coli were resistant to ampicillin in the beginning of the study and declined quickly to below detection by week seven antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci decayed at significantly faster rates than total counterparts e coli were present on carrots at harvest the majority of which were resistant to ampicillin prevalence of mdr e coli declined significantly over time while mdr enterococci persisted since no culturable e coli or enterococci were observed in non amended soils antibiotic resistant phenotypes observed in amended soil are most likely from biosolids this work is the first to directly compare declining populations of total and antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci and the persistence of mdr phenotypes of these enteric bacterial indicators in soils after biosolids amendment and wastewater irrigation findings allow for cautious optimism that use of wastewater effluent would not significantly increase antibiotic resistant enteric bacteria in soil the survival of fecal indicator bacteria in soil and on harvested carrots however indicates the transmission risks associated with biosolids amendment to harvested root crops the difference in mdr patterns between e coli and enterococci encourages the need for additional studies on the topic use of culture based methods in this study is useful in identifying and quantifying fecal indicator bacteria that actively expressed resistance to the target antibiotics the limitation of this approach is in the number and types of cultivatable bacteria and target antibiotics moreover the application of culture based methods does not include antibiotic resistant bacteria that are viable but non culturable i e bacteria in vbnc state combining culture dependent and culture independent methods are needed to give further insight to the fate of enteric arbs and their expression of mdr conclusions environmental pollution by antibiotics and arb is a growing concern as reuse of municipal biosolids and wastewater in agriculture climbs due to shortages of water valuable nutrients results of this study revealed that biosolids amendment in soil contributes to significant increases of total and antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci at the time of application however these levels decrease naturally over time twe irrigation did not impact abundance of these bacteria in soil under our study conditions nor did it affect prevalence of mdr isolates in biosolids amended soil total e coli and enterococci persisted in soil for the duration of study 77 days growth season of carrots and e coli was present on carrots at harvest antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci decayed faster than total bacterial counterparts and reached the limit of detection before the end of the study prevalence of mdr e coli declined significantly over time while low levels of mdr enterococci persisted the survival of bacteria in soil and on carrots after biosolids amendment indicates a low level of transmission risk from harvested crops declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

19939,biofouling is one of the major factors causing decline in membrane performance in reverse osmosis ro plants and perhaps the biggest hurdle of membrane technology chemical cleaning is periodically carried out at ro membrane installations aiming to restore membrane performance typical cleaning agents used in the water treatment industry include sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl in sequence rapid biofilm regrowth and related membrane performance decline after conventional chemical cleaning is a routinely observed phenomenon due to the inefficient removal of biomass from membrane modules since extracellular polymeric substances eps make up the strongest and predominant structural framework of biofilms disintegration of the eps matrix should be the main target for enhanced biomass removal previously we demonstrated at lab scale the use of concentrated urea as a chemical cleaning agent for ro membrane systems the protein denaturation property of urea was exploited to solubilize the proteinaceous foulants weakening the eps layer resulting in enhanced biomass solubilization and removal from ro membrane systems in this work we investigated the impact of repeated chemical cleaning cycles with urea hcl as well as naoh hcl on biomass removal and the potential adaptation of the biofilm microbial community chemical cleaning with urea hcl was consistently more effective than naoh hcl cleaning over 6 cleaning and regrowth cycles at the end of the 6 cleaning cycles the percent reduction was 35 and 41 in feed channel pressure drop 50 and 70 in total organic carbon 30 and 40 in eps proteins and 40 and 66 in the peak intensities of protein like matter after naoh hcl cleaning and urea hcl cleaning respectively 16s ribosomal rna rrna gene sequencing of the biofilm microbial community revealed that urea cleaning does not select for key biofouling families such as sphingomonadaceae and xanthomonadaceae that are known to survive conventional chemical cleaning and produce adhesive eps this study reaffirmed that urea possesses all the desirable properties of a chemical cleaning agent i e it dissolves the existing fouling layer delays fresh fouling accumulation by inhibiting the production of a more viscous eps does not cause damage to the membranes is chemically stable and environmentally friendly as it can be recycled for cleaning

by 10 15 of the start up values dow 2014 it indicates operational problems mainly due to biofouling and warrants cleaning of the membrane modules despite metabolic inactivation of microorganisms during extensive pretreatment of feed water as well as considerable removal of biodegradable organic compounds that serve as food for bacteria a few surviving microbial cells in the water will eventually result in biofouling of the membranes and feed spacers periodic membrane cleaning thus becomes a necessity of membrane installations as a control measure against extensive and irreversible

of proteins bennion and daggett 2003 it is this property of urea that has also been exploited for the enhanced solubilization of biofilms by disintegrating the proteins and weakening the cross linking character of eps whittaker et al 1984 chen and stewart 2000 rasmussen et al 2016 the structural disintegration of biofilm eps may occur as urea causes the unfolding of proteins by interrupting hydrogen bonding between amide and carbonyl groups of proteins ashraf kharaz et al 2017 urea also eliminates the formation of protein aggregates by blocking the free sulfhydryl groups that are essential to the aggregation reactions kelly and zydney 1994 mo and ng 2010 thereby enhancing biofilm eps solubilization and removal urea has also been reported to act as a chelating agent further weakening the structural integrity of the fouling layer specifically by removing divalent cations from the eps matrix complexed organic molecules implementing new or improvised biofouling control strategies can often result in a more resistant biofilm and adhesive eps layer al ashhab et al 2014 it is therefore imperative to examine the efficiency of chemical cleaning agents and their effects on biofilm microbial community and eps some studies have investigated the effects of varying feed water shear rates physical cleaning and of chemicals such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and sodium dodecylsulfate sds on the biofilm microbial communities al ashhab et al 2014 bereschenko et al 2011 al ashhab et al 2017 however these studies have been short term 24 hours in duration focusing on flux decline without feed spacer previously we carried out a comprehensive study using lab scale membrane fouling simulators mfss containing membrane and feed spacer demonstrating the superior efficiency of chemical cleaning with urea compared to conventional alkali acid protocol in terms of biomass inactivation and biofilm solubilization sanawar et al 2018 we also demonstrated the applicability and efficiency of urea as a chemical cleaning agent for full scale industrial spiral wound reverse osmosis membrane modules sanawar et al 2019 which suffered from a combination of biofouling colloidal fouling inorganic scaling and organic fouling simultaneously this study was conducted as the long term efficiency and effect of repetitive chemical cleaning cycles as applied to reverse osmosis membranes on biofilm regrowth is not well explored especially comparing two cleaning regimes while urea appeared to be a promising alternative chemical for cleaning of fouled membranes its effects on the selection of biofilm microbial composition and the resulting eps were not known herein we investigate using 16s rrna sequencing the adaptation of the microbial community in response to multiple cycles of conventional and urea based chemical cleaning biomass inactivation solubilization and removal after routine application of urea was also analyzed for the first time 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design accelerated biofilm development was carried out in membrane fouling simulators vrouwenvelder et al 2007 using the experimental set up described in great detail in our previous work sanawar et al 2018 feed water used for the experiments was tap water from the kaust desalination treatment plant refer to table s1 in supplementary materials for feed water characteristics biofilm development in the mfss was accelerated by dosing a biodegradable nutrient solution containing sodium acetate sodium nitrate and sodium dihydrogen phosphate in a mass ratio c n p of 100 20 10 to the feed water three mfss containing the same brackish water reverse osmosis membrane and feed spacers bw30 400 34i dow filmtec usa were operated simultaneously until the pressure drop increased from the initial values of 20 24 mbar to between 100 200 mbar the effective length for both the membrane and spacer sheets in the mfss was 0 20 m equal to one fifth of the membrane module length used in practice the operating conditions table 1 remained constant for all mfss to ensure similar biofilm development in each flow cell subsequently the mfss were cleaned according to a predetermined protocol table 2 with either naoh or urea co nh2 2 followed by a second stage low ph acid cleaning in sequence the urea concentration used was selected based on the preliminary assessment and optimization studies of the urea cleaning solution which investigated the effect of urea concentration temperature and membrane compatibility sanawar et al 2018 the importance of the secondary acid cleaning step in weakening the biofilm matrix was discussed in our previous study sanawar et al 2018 we reported that pairing of urea and hcl yielded higher cleaning efficiencies the possible physico chemical interactions hydrolysis and solubilization between acidic cleaners and foulants zondervan and roffel 2007 porcelli and judd 2010 may be responsible for enhanced biofilm solubilization during the secondary acid cleaning stage each cleaning agent was recirculated in the mfss for 1 hour duplicate experiments were performed for 1 cleaning cycle and 6 consecutive cleaning cycles with each protocol ro cleaning frequency due to fouling varies from site to site acceptable cleaning frequency according to membrane manufacturers is once every 3 to 12 months hydranautics 2014 in practice cip frequency in ro plants ranges between once a week in cases of severe fouling to three times per year miyakawa et al 2021 therefore the 6 cycle cleaning period in this study could simulate a two year period in practice with a cleaning frequency of three times per year the temperature of the cleaning solutions naoh and co nh2 2 was kept at 35 c during cleaning as per industry guidelines madaeni and samieirad 2010 dow 2014 the applied concentration of urea 1340 g lwater is the saturated concentration at 30 c to ensure that urea remains in solution at 35 c and to maximize the biofilm solubilization sanawar et al 2018 bioreagent grade 98 urea acs reagent 37 hcl and reagent grade 98 naoh were purchased from sigma aldrich usa feed channel pressure drop development was monitored throughout the experiment including the chemical cleaning phases fcp drop measurements are based on the resistance that water experiences when flowing in the feed channel as the biofilm develops membrane autopsies were subsequently carried out on retrieved membrane and feed spacer coupons from the mfss for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the fouling deposits membrane and spacer coupons were cut from the inlet side of the mfs using sterile scissors and tweezers the coupon dimensions were measured with calipers so that the results can be reported per area of the combined membrane and spacer surface the extent and composition of the fouling layer was assessed using various analytical procedures described below 2 2 biomass analysis adenosine triphosphate atp analysis was used to quantify active biomass remaining after each cleaning using the atp celsis luminometer advance germany according to the suppliers protocol the total amount of carbon content of the accumulated organic matter was determined in terms of total organic carbon toc analysis with a shimadzu toc analyser toc vcph cpn japan the biomass detachment from membrane and spacer coupons and quantification method was described previously sanawar et al 2017 briefly membrane and spacer coupons were cut from the inlet side of the mfs using sterile tools the coupon dimensions were measured with calipers so that the results can be reported per area of the combined membrane and spacer surface the coupons were placed in centrifuge tubes containing 20 ml of autoclaved tap water for atp analysis and 20 ml of tap water for toc analysis the tubes with the coupons were placed in an ultrasonic water bath bransonic model 5510e dth output 135 w 42 khz for two minutes followed by mixing on a vortex for one minute to remove biomass from the membrane and spacer surface the procedure was repeated three times and the solutions after removing the coupons was used for biomass quantification by means of atp and toc analysis 2 3 extracellular polymeric substances eps analysis biomass removed from membrane and feed spacer coupons was suspended in 10 ml of phosphate buffered saline pbs solution a standard formaldehyde naoh method was used to extract eps liu and fang 2002 from the biomass fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem was used to identify the predominant organics in the extracted eps such as protein like substances humic fulvic like substances tyrosine containing proteins and others in their study liu and fang 2002 demonstrated that the formaldehyde naoh process extracted the highest amounts of eps with only 1 1 1 2 extracellular dna found in the extracted eps suggesting that the method did not cause cell lysis and the extracted eps was not contaminated by intracellular substances feem was measured using a fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer horiba scientific japan under excitation of 240 to 450 nm and emission of 290 to 600 nm at a speed of 1500 nm min 1 a voltage of 700 v and a response time of 2 s in addition total proteins were quantified using the bca assay kit thermo fisher scientific usa according to the manufacturer s guidelines 2 4 dna extraction and illumina sequencing microbial genomic dna was extracted from the biofilm retained on the membrane and spacer surfaces using the dneasy powerwater kit purchased from qiagen usa as per manufacturer s protocol the concentration of extracted dna was confirmed using qubit dsdna br assay kit with the qubit 2 0 fluorometer thermo fisher scientific usa the total microbial communities in the extracted dna samples were determined by the dnasense laboratory denmark by performing 16s rrna gene based high throughput sequencing on illumina miseq platform the forward 515f gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa and reverse 806r ggactacnvgggtwtctaat primers were designed to amplify v4 region of 16s rrna gene apprill et al 2015 illumina 2015 bacterial community analysis was performed using mothur v 1 40 0 as following the procedure as described in the mothur website https www mothur org wiki miseq sop kozich et al 2013 all the sequences were aligned to a silva bacterial reference https www arb silva de quast et al 2012 and the chimeric sequences were identified and removed using a chimera vsearch command the taxonomy of 16s rrna sequences were assigned using the ribosomal database project rdp classifier wang et al 2007 based on silva 16s rrna database ssu123 the bacterial alpha diversity was calculated using the shannon weaver diversity index h with the following equation h n 1 n p i in p i where p i is the proportion of each species in the sample the sequences were compared for their bray curtis similarities and represented graphically for spatial distribution in a multivariate statistics plot called principal component analysis pca sequence reads for this study were submitted to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi and were made available under the accession number prjna715972 3 results 3 1 membrane performance restoration biofilm formation inside the membrane fouling simulators mfss resulted in an increase in pressure drop across the feed spacer channel chemical cleanings were applied for 6 consecutive cycles on days 7 14 22 28 33 and 36 corresponding to cleaning cycles 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 to each mfs once the pressure drop increased significantly between 100 200 mbar over the 0 20 m long membrane sheet the initial pressure drop was 20 24 mbar the percent reduction in pressure drop after each chemical cleaning cycle was used to indicate the restoration of membrane performance fig 1 urea hcl cleaning consistently resulted in a better restoration of feed channel pressure drop compared to naoh hcl cleaning although the difference was not significant for each of the six cleaning cycles p 0 05 regardless of the type of chemical cleaning applied a downward trend in pressure drop restoration efficiency was observed after the 3rd cleaning cycle onwards fig 1 for cleaning cycles 1 3 the average pressure drop restoration was 46 3 and 56 10 for naoh and urea cleaning respectively for cleaning cycles 4 6 recovery of the feed channel pressure drop decreased to an average of 35 7 and 41 6 for naoh and urea cleaning respectively this gradual decrease in the efficiency of chemical cleaning to restore membrane performance indicates a build up of the fouling layer over time albeit slower with urea cleaning with regards to membrane operation it is worthy to mention that cleaning procedures are done without permeate production to reduce the membrane s hydraulic resistance andes et al 2013 bates 2018 therefore theoretically permeation of urea should not occur nevertheless even under regular operation with flux urea rejection for ro membranes is about 60 ray et al 2020 reaching 96 with specifically developed ro membranes urea molecule has more hydrogen bonding sites that form more hydrogen bonds with the membrane leading to a higher rejection 3 2 biomass inactivation and removal an autopsy of the membrane feed spacer in each mfs was carried out after the 1st and 6th cleaning cycles the quantification of biomass remaining on the membrane spacer surfaces was carried out using atp active biomass and toc organic carbon of accumulated biomass cleaning with urea resulted in a considerably lower amount of atp fig 2 a and toc fig 2b after each cleaning cycle indicating higher inactivation and cleaning efficiency compared to the conventional acid alkali cleaning protocol in other words cleaning with urea hcl resulted in higher biomass inactivation and removal for 6 consecutive cleaning cycles over time there was no significant difference between the amount of atp measured after 1 and 6 cleaning cycles with either cleaning method p 0 05 chemical cleaning was able to achieve 2 3 log microbial inactivation compared to the uncleaned control with urea hcl cleaning there was also no significant difference p 0 05 between the amount of biomass residue measured as toc after 1 and 6 cleaning cycles however the difference was significant between the concentrations of toc after 1 cleaning cycle versus 6 cleaning cycles with naoh hcl p 0 05 the toc concentration increased between the 1st and 6th cleaning cycles by 0 03 mg cm2 and 0 01 mg cm2 with naoh hcl and urea hcl cleaning respectively the conventional cleaning strategy therefore caused a higher biomass accumulation over time whereas urea based cleaning protocol slowed down biomass accumulation 3 3 biofilm solubilization the protein solubilizing property of urea is exploited during the chemical cleaning of fouled membranes to disintegrate the eps structure of biofilms the efficiency of chemical cleanings to solubilize biofilms was therefore determined by extracting the eps from the biomass remaining on the membrane spacer surfaces after 1st and 6th cleaning the concentration of proteins was lower in the eps extracted from biomass remaining after urea cleaning as opposed to conventional cleaning fig 3 the protein content was higher after the 6th cleaning cycle indicating the accumulation of bacterial eps over time however the difference was not significant when compared to the 1st cleaning cycle p 0 05 urea hcl cleaning was more effective in solubilizing biofilm proteins than naoh hcl cleaning the feem spectra presented in fig 4 show the changes in biofilm eps composition after chemical cleaning the four regions of feem plots are i humic like substances ex 320 nm em 425 nm ii protein like matter ex 275 nm em 330 nm iii fulvic acid like substances ex 260 nm em 475 nm and iv tyrosine containing proteins ex 235 nm em 330 nm the feem plot of the uncleaned control membrane spacer shows a distinct peak for protein like substances and a strong peak for tyrosine containing substances which are typically proteinaceous and associated with amino acids fig 4 both peaks ii and iv were present at a much lower intensity on the membranes treated by chemical cleaning the peak intensities were higher in the spectra of eps extracted after 6 cleaning cycles compared to 1 cleaning cycle indicating a build up of biofilm associated eps with time as also reported for total proteins analysis in fig 3 after the 6th cleaning cycle with naoh hcl and urea hcl the average peak intensity for the protein like matter was reduced by 40 and 66 respectively while the average peak intensity for tyrosine containing proteins was reduced by 21 and 45 respectively compared to the uncleaned control in other words compared to the conventional acid alkali cleaning treatment urea based cleaning protocols were able to solubilize protein like substances and tyrosine containing proteins more effectively indicating higher biofilm cleaning efficiency on the contrary the eps of urea treated biofilms showed higher peaks of humic like substances and fulvic acid like substances 15 519 and 81 056 counts per second microampere respectively compared to the eps of naoh treated biofilms 11 287 and 63 838 counts per second microampere respectively 3 4 microbial community composition the bacterial community composition for biofilms after the 1st and 6th cleaning cycles compared to the control is shown in fig 5 from the phylum to class level the results presented are averaged from duplicate mfs experiments and the data was reproducible in both experiments the dominant phylum was proteobacteria in all biofilms ranging in relative abundance from 82 to 96 the phylum bacteroidetes was present at a much lower abundance in the chemically cleaned biofilms ranging from 0 6 to 4 6 the bacterial community was least diverse after the 6th cleaning cycle with urea in which proteobacteria accounted for 96 of the bacterial community and only 1 6 unclassified bacteria comparatively in the control biofilm the relative abundance of proteobacteria and unclassified bacteria was 82 and 17 respectively indicating a more diverse microbial composition at the class level β proteobacteria was predominant across all biofilms fig 5b compared to the uncleaned control the relative abundance of β proteobacteria decreased slightly after the 1st and 6th cleaning cycle with naoh 57 and 59 respectively but increased after cleaning with urea 79 and 83 respectively the second most dominant class was α proteobacteria which was present at a higher abundance in the biofilms treated with naoh 14 25 than with urea 3 5 thirdly γ proteobacteria increased in abundance in mature biofilms sequenced after 6 cleaning cycles 8 in comparison with membranes cleaned once and the control 1 7 3 6 the most dominant families across all levels were comamonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae of the β lineage fig 6 comamonadaceae were highly abundant in the control and biofilms treated with naoh ranging from 37 53 and less abundant in biofilms treated with urea 16 33 on the contrary rhodocyclaceae which dominated the urea treated biofilms 43 65 were less abundant in the control and naoh treated biofilms ranging from 5 17 in the α lineage of proteobacteria the most abundant family was sphingomonadaceae in the control 9 6 and biofilm after 1 cleaning cycle with naoh 18 however the abundance decreased remarkably in biofilms treated with urea 1 7 2 9 and after 6 cleaning cycles with naoh 2 8 comparatively pseudomonadaceae of the γ lineage were more abundant in mature biofilms sequenced after 6 cleaning cycles 3 4 5 9 than all other biofilms 0 8 1 0 also from the γ lineage xanthomonadaceae was the most abundant in the mature biofilm obtained after 6 cleaning cycles with naoh 5 3 5 bacterial diversity the shannon weaver diversity index h is an estimate of the alpha bacterial diversity and it increases as both species richness and evenness increase the diversity index table 3 increased after 6 cleaning cycles with naoh 2 7 and decreased after 6 cleaning cycles with urea 1 8 compared to the control biofilm 2 5 the bacterial community was the least diverse and more homogenous after the 6th cleaning cycle with urea under toxic conditions for example at excessively high concentrations of pharmaceuticals microorganisms lose their vitality which in turn leads to a decline of biodiversity song et al 2020 possibly the saturated urea solution 1340 g lwater exerts a similar toxic shock to the microorganisms the non phylogenetic diversity is represented in fig 7 showing reproducible data from duplicate mfs experiments principal component analysis pca showed that the uncleaned control c and biofilm sequenced after 1st cleaning with naoh n1 clustered together along the pc1 and pc2 axes suggesting that the microbial community was very similar as the biofilm matured over 6 cleaning cycles with naoh n6 it was observed in a separate cluster close to that of c and n1 suggesting that the microbial communities were similar but with some differences this distinct clustering is because the bacterial population responds to repeated chemical stresses and evolves to confer resistance to the cleaning agents the microbial community in biofilms treated with 1 or 6 cleaning cycles with urea u1 and u6 was very different from the c and n samples indicating that the type of chemical cleaning agent influences the microbial community composition 4 discussion the setback with conventional chemical cleaning strategies is their failure to remove fouling deposits from the membrane and spacer surfaces entirely not only does this prevent the restoration of membrane performance indicators such as feed channel pressure drop but it also results in rapid biofilm regrowth post cleaning dead biomass often remains on the membrane surface as such killing only does not help to recover flux flemming 2020 the inactivated biomass post cleaning serves as food for microorganisms surviving the cleaning while the collapsed biofilm layer and eps provide a conditioned surface for immediate microbial colonization after chemical cleaning bereschenko et al 2011 vrouwenvelder et al 2011 several researchers have highlighted the need for novel cleaning strategies targeting biomass removal for biofouling control bereschenko et al 2011 sadekuzzaman et al 2015 beyer et al 2017 this study investigated the effects of multiple cleaning cycles with an alternative chemical urea a chaotropic agent in comparison with conventional cleaning to enhance the removal of biomass and resistant microbial communities 4 1 biomass inactivation adenosine triphosphate atp a measure of active biomass content was almost 1 log lower after 1 and 6 cleaning cycles with urea compared to naoh fig 2a urea molecules are capable of diffusing into the biofilm space and bacterial cells leading to osmotic lysis rasmussen et al 2016 thus higher inactivation of biomass the fact that there was no significant difference between the atp content measured after 1 and 6 cleaning cycles hints at the possibility that there might be a certain threshold of inactivation based on the cleaning duration at a specified concentration and temperature in practice the chemical cleaning duration is almost always longer than 1 hour between 6 24 hours consisting of several phases of high flow recirculation and soaking beyer et al 2017 it would be beneficial to experiment with a longer contact time than 1 hour with concentrated urea solution at a temperature of 35 c following industry guidelines 4 2 biomass removal unlike atp the toc content was higher after 6 cleaning cycles with either chemical suggesting the accumulation of biomass over time fig 2b however biomass removal was consistently greater with urea cleaning indicated by a lower toc content compared to the conventional cleaning which allowed for greater biomass accumulation with time inefficient biomass removal from the membrane spacer surface and from the membrane installation is the core issue of conventional chemical cleaning as documented by several authors and reiterated by this study eventually leading to irreversibly fouled membranes requiring early membrane replacement creber et al 2010 a build up of biomass over time is also illustrated by the increase in feed channel pressure drop fig 1 restoration of membrane performance after chemical cleaning was monitored by measuring feed channel pressure drop reduction after the 3rd cleaning cycle a downward trend was observed with either chemical cleaning in terms of restoring the pressure drop in other words a decline in membrane performance is a result of biomass eps accumulation over time indicated by higher toc content reduction in performance restoration was expected since a gradual loss of membrane system performance is inevitable after extended operation bucs et al 2018 however urea cleaning is more effective than conventional cleaning in terms of maintaining the membrane system performance in the long run by i reducing biomass accumulation and ii reducing its impact on membrane performance a substantial increase in the removal of biomass with urea is most likely because urea disintegrates the biofilm eps the strongest structural framework of biofilms as discussed below a small improvement in the cleaning efficiency will make a difference for the performance of full scale desalination membrane installations pairing and alternating physical and chemical cleaning methods may be more effective in removing the fouling deposits that are solubilized by urea periodic air water cleaning cornelissen et al 2007 alpatova et al 2020 for example could help reverse the downward trend observed for pressure drop restoration after the 3rd chemical cleaning cycles moreover the use of geometrically modified feed spacer designs may enable better cleaning as well kerdi et al 2018 4 3 biomass solubilization in agreement with our previous study which demonstrated enhanced biofilm solubilization by urea cleaning 1 cycle sanawar et al 2018 the results of this study also validate the superior efficiency of urea for biofilm protein solubilization for multiple cleaning cycles the concentration of proteins was lower after cleaning with urea for 1 and 6 cleaning cycles compared to the conventional cleaning fig 3 similarly feem analysis revealed that the peak intensities of protein like matter and tyrosine containing proteins on the membrane spacer surface were significantly lower after urea cleaning fig 4 the attachment and aggregation of proteins on the membrane surface have been shown to accelerate fouling kelly and zydney 1995 urea acts as protein denaturant by i forcing the unfolding of proteins and ii preventing the formation of protein aggregates by blocking the free sulfhydryl group which are essential for aggregation reactions kelly and zydney 1994 chemical cleaning with urea thereby minimizes the accumulation of proteinaceous foulants on the membrane surface and also weakens the eps structure by disintegrating one of its main components furthermore extracellular proteins can also increase the hydrophobicity of eps due to their high proportions of hydrophobic amino acids higgins and novak 1997 flemming et al 2000 urea diminishes the hydrophobic effect by encouraging solvation of hydrophobic groups zou et al 1998 bennion and daggett 2003 zangi et al 2009 wang et al 2014 in effect urea cleaning makes the eps layer less hydrophobic and more water soluble making it easier to remove during chemical cleaning this decrease in the eps hydrophobicity also enhances the flow and transport of chemical solutions through the biofilm structure further increasing the cleaning efficiency humic acids are complex organic constituents of soils and water and have little solubility below ph 8 davies et al 1995 this may explain why humic like substances were solubilized better with naoh ph 12 than with urea cleaning solution ph 9 6 increasing the ph of saturated urea solution could be considered fulvic acids are soluble in water independent of the ph they are natural amphiphilic polymers that aid in bacterial detachment from interfaces neu and lawrence 2010 recently it was reported that the higher presence of fulvic acids in the biofilm grown at a lower phosphorus concentration helped solubilize and detach the biofilm from the membrane and spacer javier et al 2021 based on this knowledge we suggest that higher protein solubilization together with the presence of more soluble and amphiphilic polymers in the eps enhances the solubilization of biofilms by urea cleaning urea s higher protein solubilization benefits the removal of the whole biofilm matrix including the polysaccharides as urea creates a loose fouling layer that allows for deeper penetration of hcl into the biofilm consequently enhancing the solubilization of all the deposits it would be worth performing direct measurements of the biofilm mechanical strength to better understand the mechanism of urea cleaning on the biofilm layer 4 4 microbial communities and biofilm resistance microbial community analysis using next generation 16s rrna gene sequencing revealed that proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all samples while bacteroidetes was the second most abundant phylum fig 5 similar microbial community compositions were reported by two previous studies that applied 16s rrna pyrosequencing belila et al 2016 and shotgun metagenomics sequencing rehman et al 2019 approach to investigate the microbial ecology of the kaust desalination ro plant the feed water used in this study is the product of the same ro plant the results are also in agreement with several studies from around the world which demonstrate that proteobacteria dominate seawater associated bacterial communities and also fouled ro membranes bereschenko et al 2008 manes et al 2011 nagaraja et al 2017 studies on early biofilm formation have identified members of proteobacteria dang and lovell 2000 lee et al 2008 followed by bacteroidetes salta et al 2013 as the primary surface colonizers which explains their high abundance pinto et al 2019 the results indicate a relatively uniform bacterial community in the urea treated biofilms as opposed to naoh treated biofilms future studies could examine whether the higher phylogenetic similarity of biofilms post urea treatment may lead to better biofouling control the relative abundance of three main classes of the phylum proteobacteria was in the following order β proteobacteria α proteobacteria γ proteobacteria from the β lineage the families comamonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae were highly abundant fig 6 members of both the families have been identified as key denitrifiers khan et al 2002 bellini et al 2017 dong et al 2019 and commonly reported in microbial communities in activated sludge systems sadaie et al 2007 tandoi et al 2017 research has shown that nitrate reducing bacteria play an important role in the formation of biofilms on ro membranes pang and liu 2007 nagaraja et al 2017 biofilms are known to contain anoxic regions in which such nitrate reducing bacteria can thrive von ohle et al 2010 the availability of nitrate in the feed water rehman et al 2019 and the substrate provides means of sustaining the denitrifiers and suggests that nitrate reduction plays a significant role in the survival of biofilm microbial community post chemical cleaning in addition three families of proteobacteria are of particular importance in relation to biofouling erythrobacteraceae and sphingomonadaceae both representing the order sphingomonadales from the α lineage and xanthomonadaceae from the γ lineage microbial community members belonging to these families are known to produce adhesive eps which also serves as a medium for the attachment and growth for other microorganisms bereschenko et al 2010 nagaraja et al 2017 el beaino et al 2018 sphingomonadaceae that are dominant during biofilm initiation and maturation in ro membranes produce eps with high mechanical and heat resistance de vries et al 2019 some members of the family sphingomonadaceae can even survive autoclaving ashtaputre and shah 1995 while others produce gel like eps called sphingans which enhance cell adhesion and provide strong rigidity gutman et al 2014 schmid et al 2015 it is known that members of the sphingomonadaceae family are able to persist membrane cleaning bereschenko et al 2010 the genome sequences of xanthomonadaceae contain many genes for the formation of surface adhesive structures which results in the aggregation and increased resistance of biofilms to various stresses mhedbi hajri et al 2011 the relative abundance of sphingomonadaceae doubled after 1 cleaning cycle with naoh compared to the control fig 6 after 6 cleaning cycles with naoh the relative abundance of sphingomonadaceae decreased significantly however erythrobacteraceae and xanthomonadaceae become more pronounced instead comparatively the relative abundance of the families mentioned above was negligible after cleaning with urea in other words naoh cleaning resulted in the selection of microbial communities that produce adhesive and resistant eps whereas urea cleaning did not pseudomonadaceae proliferated in mature biofilms even after chemical cleaning with urea 6 relative abundance members belonging to the family pseudomonadaceae produce large amounts of eps barnes et al 2014 although no pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected at the species level the diversity of the biofilm microbial community after urea cleaning remained lower than that after naoh cleaning suggesting that only a fraction of the population survived the urea cleaning procedure biofilm ageing under representative conditions for ro membranes in practice is an important factor in anti fouling research that requires particular attention 4 5 recovery and reuse of urea initial experiments carried out in collaboration with delft university of technology successfully recovered urea crystals from the waste cleaning solution using eutectic freeze crystallization efc alexopoulos 2018 the preliminary study also revealed that impurities are not embedded inside the crystalline structure of urea thus washing of the crystals can effectively increase the purity of recovered urea alexopoulos 2018 the optimization of the efc process including scale up of the efc reactor to 100 l is an ongoing study examining the purity of the recovered urea crystals using more accurate and advanced analytical techniques will be carried out this would allow for urea to be reused after the removal of impurities not only is urea a cheap chemical to purchase but if it can be reused for cleaning it presents an excellent opportunity for ro plants to reduce the volume of chemical waste and costs associated with transport storage and discharge of chemicals an environmental risk assessment is in fact needed to evaluate the use and reuse of cleaning chemicals conventional and urea based for full scale ro membrane filtration installations examining the efficiency cost and environmental impact of chemical cleaning strategies 4 6 outlook biofilms are highly complex and their physical chemical and microbial composition may vary from one plant to another biofilm formation is influenced by a wide variety of factors such as feed water quality pretreatment methods operating conditions and cleaning protocols chemical cleaning with urea may not apply to all types of biofilms for efficient biofouling control it may be suggested to i understand the site specific processes influencing biofilm formation ii implement preventive control strategies such as effective pretreatment to delay biofouling and iii examine biofouling characteristics to select the most effective membrane cleaning method it is known that biofilm eps composition can vary with age nutrient availability in feed water and membrane surface properties javier et al 2021 for example jafari et al 2020 studied two full scale ro installations one in belgium and one in the netherlands and concluded that biofilm developed in full scale modules contain protein rich eps however beyer et al 2017 measured the eps composition for three full scale ro installations in the netherlands and reported polysaccharide rich eps from biofilms developed in full scale ro plants it would be useful to study the impact of urea on protein rich versus polysaccharide rich biofilms sodium alginate a hydrophilic microbial polysaccharide could also be used as a model for organic fouling katsoufidou et al 2007 membrane cleaning is only one of the curative aspects of biofouling control preventive biofouling control strategies such as modifications of membrane spacer surfaces to reduce biofilm growth and adhesion should also be studied in combination with the cleanability of resulting biofilms the chemical mechanism and possible modifications of the urea hcl cleaning method should be explored pairing or alternating urea cleaning with a chemical agent that has a complementary cleaning mechanism could enhance biofilm removal possibly eliminating the development of microorganisms resistant to a certain chemical information is clearly needed about the biofilm reinforcement over long term periods with and without the impact of series of cleanings as potentially can be applied in full scale spiral wound ro installations lab scale simulation studies often use chemicals for cleanings that cannot be used in practice because of legislative restrictions such studies could be done with well defined feed water to eliminate the role of seasonal variations e g algal bloom affecting chemical dosages and pretreatment operation whilst focusing first on biofilm development with time without cleanings for such studies choices must be made with regards to the scope objective and feasibility of the research question parameters of relevance are biomass quantification parameters eps adherence properties jafari et al 2020 biofilm mechanical strength and the microbial community composition aside from the conventional organic solvents a relatively new and green alternative is the natural deep eutectic solvents nades dai et al 2013 a mixture of nades may be prepared with urea and other natural compounds such as organic acids amino acids and sugars which could possibly have the potential to solubilize the macromolecules of biofilms similarly combining urea cleaning with an intermittent physical cleaning cycle could also be highly beneficial urea creates a loose fouling layer that would not only be more readily attacked by subsequent chemicals but would also be more effectively removed by physical cleaning lab scale studies should also aim to clean at the early stages of biofouling and examine the differences in biofilms that form without biodegradable nutrient dosage to the feed water in situ imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography may elicit important biofilm structural characteristics fortunato et al 2017 hou et al 2019 the two major advantages of urea as a chemical cleaning agent are that it i denatures proteins aiding in better chemical penetration for an enhanced overall biofilm disintegration and ii reduces the relative abundance of key biofouling microorganisms such as sphingomonads both these aspects of urea cleaning aid increased solubilization of the eps matrix resulting in deeper cleaning higher biomass removal and reduced impact on membrane performance during extended membrane operation this suggests that urea cleaning could prevent the financially daunting risk of early membrane replacement the recycling and reuse of urea also provides an opportunity for greener chemical cleaning and reducing the costs associated with cleaning the recrystallization of urea from the waste solution has been successful using eutectic freeze crystallization optimization of the crystallization procedure and an investigation of the purity of reclaimed urea crystals is currently being pursued to sum up a urea based cleaning strategy outperforms conventional chemical cleaning consistently during short and long term membrane operations it is an inexpensive and effective approach to control the biological fouling of reverse osmosis membrane systems demonstrated at lab scale and pilot scale 5 conclusions membrane fouling simulators mimicking the structure and hydraulics of industrial spiral wound reverse osmosis membrane modules were used to carry out accelerated biofilm formation by dosing a biodegradable nutrient solution to the feed the effects of multiple chemical cleaning cycles by conventional alkali acid combination and urea hcl were studied for biomass removal and microbial community composition the following conclusions were drawn based on the results chemical cleaning with urea provides higher inactivation and removal of biomass proteinaceous foulants are solubilized and removed much more efficiently with urea cleaning compared to the conventional cleaning although a gradual accumulation of biomass may be inevitable with increasing membrane operation time chemical cleaning with urea reduces biomass accumulation and reduces its impact on membrane performance during extended operation much better than the conventional cleaning urea cleaning does not select for resistant microbial communities on the membrane that are known to be largely responsible for biofouling such as sphingomonads through the extensive production of adhesive eps further optimization of the urea cleaning protocol is recommended to include a different combination of secondary chemical s and or intermittent physical chemical

19939,biofouling is one of the major factors causing decline in membrane performance in reverse osmosis ro plants and perhaps the biggest hurdle of membrane technology chemical cleaning is periodically carried out at ro membrane installations aiming to restore membrane performance typical cleaning agents used in the water treatment industry include sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl in sequence rapid biofilm regrowth and related membrane performance decline after conventional chemical cleaning is a routinely observed phenomenon due to the inefficient removal of biomass from membrane modules since extracellular polymeric substances eps make up the strongest and predominant structural framework of biofilms disintegration of the eps matrix should be the main target for enhanced biomass removal previously we demonstrated at lab scale the use of concentrated urea as a chemical cleaning agent for ro membrane systems the protein denaturation property of urea was exploited to solubilize the proteinaceous foulants weakening the eps layer resulting in enhanced biomass solubilization and removal from ro membrane systems in this work we investigated the impact of repeated chemical cleaning cycles with urea hcl as well as naoh hcl on biomass removal and the potential adaptation of the biofilm microbial community chemical cleaning with urea hcl was consistently more effective than naoh hcl cleaning over 6 cleaning and regrowth cycles at the end of the 6 cleaning cycles the percent reduction was 35 and 41 in feed channel pressure drop 50 and 70 in total organic carbon 30 and 40 in eps proteins and 40 and 66 in the peak intensities of protein like matter after naoh hcl cleaning and urea hcl cleaning respectively 16s ribosomal rna rrna gene sequencing of the biofilm microbial community revealed that urea cleaning does not select for key biofouling families such as sphingomonadaceae and xanthomonadaceae that are known to survive conventional chemical cleaning and produce adhesive eps this study reaffirmed that urea possesses all the desirable properties of a chemical cleaning agent i e it dissolves the existing fouling layer delays fresh fouling accumulation by inhibiting the production of a more viscous eps does not cause damage to the membranes is chemically stable and environmentally friendly as it can be recycled for cleaning graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords seawater desalination membrane fouling biofilm resistance chemical cleaning urea 1 introduction fouling impairs the efficiency of membrane filtration processes such as reverse osmosis ro biofouling unwanted deposition and growth of microorganisms to form biofilms is the most problematic and complex type of fouling that hinders membrane performance matin et al 2011 about 70 of the ro plants in the middle east suffer from biofouling problems khedr 2000 characterized by flux decline reduced permeate quality and an increase in differential pressure and related increase in energy consumption and operating costs flemming 1997 initial deposits of fouling accumulate on the feed channel spacer baker et al 1995 resulting in an exponential increase of the feed channel pressure drop caused by biofouling accumulation onto the feed spacer of membrane modules van paassen et al 1998 when the feed channel pressure drop increases by 10 15 of the start up values dow 2014 it indicates operational problems mainly due to biofouling and warrants cleaning of the membrane modules despite metabolic inactivation of microorganisms during extensive pretreatment of feed water as well as considerable removal of biodegradable organic compounds that serve as food for bacteria a few surviving microbial cells in the water will eventually result in biofouling of the membranes and feed spacers periodic membrane cleaning thus becomes a necessity of membrane installations as a control measure against extensive and irreversible biofouling bucs et al 2014 physical cleaning methods such as forward reverse flushing and air sparging deploy mechanical forces to remove the fouling layer from the membrane and spacer surface ebrahim 1994 cornelissen et al 2007 chemical cleaning relies on weakening the biofilm structure with the use of appropriate chemicals that may be alkaline acidic metal chelating agents surfactants oxidizing agents and enzymes al amoudi and lovitt 2007 full scale ro plants most commonly use two step cleaning with i sodium hydroxide naoh ph 11 12 to remove organic fouling and biofouling by hydrolysis and solubilization followed by ii hydrochloric acid hcl ph 1 2 to dissolve scaling disrupt the bacterial cell wall structure and also precipitate proteins dow 2014 hydranautics 2014 beyer et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 however several studies have reported that conventional cleaning methods do not effectively restore membrane performance vrouwenvelder et al 1998 huiting et al 2001 beyer et al 2017 a year long study at a full scale ro plant revealed that each weekly chemical treatment resulted in the collapse of the established three dimensional biofilm structure but not in biofilm removal bereschenko et al 2011 rapid biofilm regrowth is known to take place after the application of conventional chemical cleaning requiring more frequent and harsh cleaning protocols vrouwenvelder et al 1998 bereschenko et al 2011 frequent chemical cleaning can lead to the hardening of the foulant layers baker and dudley 1998 microorganisms can excrete large amounts of extracellular polymeric substances eps as a defense mechanism against the chemicals baker and dudley 1998 bereschenko et al 2010 this eps material further strengthens the binding forces in the biofilm making it harder to clean over time accumulation of eps also results in the formation of a gel layer on the membrane providing a conditioned surface for further bacterial attachment and growth flemming et al 2007 bereschenko et al 2010 ultimately early membrane replacement may be required which imposes a substantial financial burden on the water treatment plants flemming 2011 and may pose a risk for contractual requirements related to continued supply of the quality and quality of ro produced water eps can be considered the strongest and largest structural framework of biofilms and may account for 50 to 90 of the total organic carbon of biofilms matin et al 2011 dreszer et al 2013 it is therefore important that chemical cleaning should aim to disintegrate and remove the eps matrix composed mainly of proteins polysaccharides and other macromolecules in other words anti fouling research must focus on biofilm biology flemming 2020 urea a chaotropic agent has been used for the solubilization and denaturation of proteins bennion and daggett 2003 it is this property of urea that has also been exploited for the enhanced solubilization of biofilms by disintegrating the proteins and weakening the cross linking character of eps whittaker et al 1984 chen and stewart 2000 rasmussen et al 2016 the structural disintegration of biofilm eps may occur as urea causes the unfolding of proteins by interrupting hydrogen bonding between amide and carbonyl groups of proteins ashraf kharaz et al 2017 urea also eliminates the formation of protein aggregates by blocking the free sulfhydryl groups that are essential to the aggregation reactions kelly and zydney 1994 mo and ng 2010 thereby enhancing biofilm eps solubilization and removal urea has also been reported to act as a chelating agent further weakening the structural integrity of the fouling layer specifically by removing divalent cations from the eps matrix complexed organic molecules implementing new or improvised biofouling control strategies can often result in a more resistant biofilm and adhesive eps layer al ashhab et al 2014 it is therefore imperative to examine the efficiency of chemical cleaning agents and their effects on biofilm microbial community and eps some studies have investigated the effects of varying feed water shear rates physical cleaning and of chemicals such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and sodium dodecylsulfate sds on the biofilm microbial communities al ashhab et al 2014 bereschenko et al 2011 al ashhab et al 2017 however these studies have been short term 24 hours in duration focusing on flux decline without feed spacer previously we carried out a comprehensive study using lab scale membrane fouling simulators mfss containing membrane and feed spacer demonstrating the superior efficiency of chemical cleaning with urea compared to conventional alkali acid protocol in terms of biomass inactivation and biofilm solubilization sanawar et al 2018 we also demonstrated the applicability and efficiency of urea as a chemical cleaning agent for full scale industrial spiral wound reverse osmosis membrane modules sanawar et al 2019 which suffered from a combination of biofouling colloidal fouling inorganic scaling and organic fouling simultaneously this study was conducted as the long term efficiency and effect of repetitive chemical cleaning cycles as applied to reverse osmosis membranes on biofilm regrowth is not well explored especially comparing two cleaning regimes while urea appeared to be a promising alternative chemical for cleaning of fouled membranes its effects on the selection of biofilm microbial composition and the resulting eps were not known herein we investigate using 16s rrna sequencing the adaptation of the microbial community in response to multiple cycles of conventional and urea based chemical cleaning biomass inactivation solubilization and removal after routine application of urea was also analyzed for the first time 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design accelerated biofilm development was carried out in membrane fouling simulators vrouwenvelder et al 2007 using the experimental set up described in great detail in our previous work sanawar et al 2018 feed water used for the experiments was tap water from the kaust desalination treatment plant refer to table s1 in supplementary materials for feed water characteristics biofilm development in the mfss was accelerated by dosing a biodegradable nutrient solution containing sodium acetate sodium nitrate and sodium dihydrogen phosphate in a mass ratio c n p of 100 20 10 to the feed water three mfss containing the same brackish water reverse osmosis membrane and feed spacers bw30 400 34i dow filmtec usa were operated simultaneously until the pressure drop increased from the initial values of 20 24 mbar to between 100 200 mbar the effective length for both the membrane and spacer sheets in the mfss was 0 20 m equal to one fifth of the membrane module length used in practice the operating conditions table 1 remained constant for all mfss to ensure similar biofilm development in each flow cell subsequently the mfss were cleaned according to a predetermined protocol table 2 with either naoh or urea co nh2 2 followed by a second stage low ph acid cleaning in sequence the urea concentration used was selected based on the preliminary assessment and optimization studies of the urea cleaning solution which investigated the effect of urea concentration temperature and membrane compatibility sanawar et al 2018 the importance of the secondary acid cleaning step in weakening the biofilm matrix was discussed in our previous study sanawar et al 2018 we reported that pairing of urea and hcl yielded higher cleaning efficiencies the possible physico chemical interactions hydrolysis and solubilization between acidic cleaners and foulants zondervan and roffel 2007 porcelli and judd 2010 may be responsible for enhanced biofilm solubilization during the secondary acid cleaning stage each cleaning agent was recirculated in the mfss for 1 hour duplicate experiments were performed for 1 cleaning cycle and 6 consecutive cleaning cycles with each protocol ro cleaning frequency due to fouling varies from site to site acceptable cleaning frequency according to membrane manufacturers is once every 3 to 12 months hydranautics 2014 in practice cip frequency in ro plants ranges between once a week in cases of severe fouling to three times per year miyakawa et al 2021 therefore the 6 cycle cleaning period in this study could simulate a two year period in practice with a cleaning frequency of three times per year the temperature of the cleaning solutions naoh and co nh2 2 was kept at 35 c during cleaning as per industry guidelines madaeni and samieirad 2010 dow 2014 the applied concentration of urea 1340 g lwater is the saturated concentration at 30 c to ensure that urea remains in solution at 35 c and to maximize the biofilm solubilization sanawar et al 2018 bioreagent grade 98 urea acs reagent 37 hcl and reagent grade 98 naoh were purchased from sigma aldrich usa feed channel pressure drop development was monitored throughout the experiment including the chemical cleaning phases fcp drop measurements are based on the resistance that water experiences when flowing in the feed channel as the biofilm develops membrane autopsies were subsequently carried out on retrieved membrane and feed spacer coupons from the mfss for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the fouling deposits membrane and spacer coupons were cut from the inlet side of the mfs using sterile scissors and tweezers the coupon dimensions were measured with calipers so that the results can be reported per area of the combined membrane and spacer surface the extent and composition of the fouling layer was assessed using various analytical procedures described below 2 2 biomass analysis adenosine triphosphate atp analysis was used to quantify active biomass remaining after each cleaning using the atp celsis luminometer advance germany according to the suppliers protocol the total amount of carbon content of the accumulated organic matter was determined in terms of total organic carbon toc analysis with a shimadzu toc analyser toc vcph cpn japan the biomass detachment from membrane and spacer coupons and quantification method was described previously sanawar et al 2017 briefly membrane and spacer coupons were cut from the inlet side of the mfs using sterile tools the coupon dimensions were measured with calipers so that the results can be reported per area of the combined membrane and spacer surface the coupons were placed in centrifuge tubes containing 20 ml of autoclaved tap water for atp analysis and 20 ml of tap water for toc analysis the tubes with the coupons were placed in an ultrasonic water bath bransonic model 5510e dth output 135 w 42 khz for two minutes followed by mixing on a vortex for one minute to remove biomass from the membrane and spacer surface the procedure was repeated three times and the solutions after removing the coupons was used for biomass quantification by means of atp and toc analysis 2 3 extracellular polymeric substances eps analysis biomass removed from membrane and feed spacer coupons was suspended in 10 ml of phosphate buffered saline pbs solution a standard formaldehyde naoh method was used to extract eps liu and fang 2002 from the biomass fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem was used to identify the predominant organics in the extracted eps such as protein like substances humic fulvic like substances tyrosine containing proteins and others in their study liu and fang 2002 demonstrated that the formaldehyde naoh process extracted the highest amounts of eps with only 1 1 1 2 extracellular dna found in the extracted eps suggesting that the method did not cause cell lysis and the extracted eps was not contaminated by intracellular substances feem was measured using a fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer horiba scientific japan under excitation of 240 to 450 nm and emission of 290 to 600 nm at a speed of 1500 nm min 1 a voltage of 700 v and a response time of 2 s in addition total proteins were quantified using the bca assay kit thermo fisher scientific usa according to the manufacturer s guidelines 2 4 dna extraction and illumina sequencing microbial genomic dna was extracted from the biofilm retained on the membrane and spacer surfaces using the dneasy powerwater kit purchased from qiagen usa as per manufacturer s protocol the concentration of extracted dna was confirmed using qubit dsdna br assay kit with the qubit 2 0 fluorometer thermo fisher scientific usa the total microbial communities in the extracted dna samples were determined by the dnasense laboratory denmark by performing 16s rrna gene based high throughput sequencing on illumina miseq platform the forward 515f gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa and reverse 806r ggactacnvgggtwtctaat primers were designed to amplify v4 region of 16s rrna gene apprill et al 2015 illumina 2015 bacterial community analysis was performed using mothur v 1 40 0 as following the procedure as described in the mothur website https www mothur org wiki miseq sop kozich et al 2013 all the sequences were aligned to a silva bacterial reference https www arb silva de quast et al 2012 and the chimeric sequences were identified and removed using a chimera vsearch command the taxonomy of 16s rrna sequences were assigned using the ribosomal database project rdp classifier wang et al 2007 based on silva 16s rrna database ssu123 the bacterial alpha diversity was calculated using the shannon weaver diversity index h with the following equation h n 1 n p i in p i where p i is the proportion of each species in the sample the sequences were compared for their bray curtis similarities and represented graphically for spatial distribution in a multivariate statistics plot called principal component analysis pca sequence reads for this study were submitted to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi and were made available under the accession number prjna715972 3 results 3 1 membrane performance restoration biofilm formation inside the membrane fouling simulators mfss resulted in an increase in pressure drop across the feed spacer channel chemical cleanings were applied for 6 consecutive cycles on days 7 14 22 28 33 and 36 corresponding to cleaning cycles 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 to each mfs once the pressure drop increased significantly between 100 200 mbar over the 0 20 m long membrane sheet the initial pressure drop was 20 24 mbar the percent reduction in pressure drop after each chemical cleaning cycle was used to indicate the restoration of membrane performance fig 1 urea hcl cleaning consistently resulted in a better restoration of feed channel pressure drop compared to naoh hcl cleaning although the difference was not significant for each of the six cleaning cycles p 0 05 regardless of the type of chemical cleaning applied a downward trend in pressure drop restoration efficiency was observed after the 3rd cleaning cycle onwards fig 1 for cleaning cycles 1 3 the average pressure drop restoration was 46 3 and 56 10 for naoh and urea cleaning respectively for cleaning cycles 4 6 recovery of the feed channel pressure drop decreased to an average of 35 7 and 41 6 for naoh and urea cleaning respectively this gradual decrease in the efficiency of chemical cleaning to restore membrane performance indicates a build up of the fouling layer over time albeit slower with urea cleaning with regards to membrane operation it is worthy to mention that cleaning procedures are done without permeate production to reduce the membrane s hydraulic resistance andes et al 2013 bates 2018 therefore theoretically permeation of urea should not occur nevertheless even under regular operation with flux urea rejection for ro membranes is about 60 ray et al 2020 reaching 96 with specifically developed ro membranes urea molecule has more hydrogen bonding sites that form more hydrogen bonds with the membrane leading to a higher rejection 3 2 biomass inactivation and removal an autopsy of the membrane feed spacer in each mfs was carried out after the 1st and 6th cleaning cycles the quantification of biomass remaining on the membrane spacer surfaces was carried out using atp active biomass and toc organic carbon of accumulated biomass cleaning with urea resulted in a considerably lower amount of atp fig 2 a and toc fig 2b after each cleaning cycle indicating higher inactivation and cleaning efficiency compared to the conventional acid alkali cleaning protocol in other words cleaning with urea hcl resulted in higher biomass inactivation and removal for 6 consecutive cleaning cycles over time there was no significant difference between the amount of atp measured after 1 and 6 cleaning cycles with either cleaning method p 0 05 chemical cleaning was able to achieve 2 3 log microbial inactivation compared to the uncleaned control with urea hcl cleaning there was also no significant difference p 0 05 between the amount of biomass residue measured as toc after 1 and 6 cleaning cycles however the difference was significant between the concentrations of toc after 1 cleaning cycle versus 6 cleaning cycles with naoh hcl p 0 05 the toc concentration increased between the 1st and 6th cleaning cycles by 0 03 mg cm2 and 0 01 mg cm2 with naoh hcl and urea hcl cleaning respectively the conventional cleaning strategy therefore caused a higher biomass accumulation over time whereas urea based cleaning protocol slowed down biomass accumulation 3 3 biofilm solubilization the protein solubilizing property of urea is exploited during the chemical cleaning of fouled membranes to disintegrate the eps structure of biofilms the efficiency of chemical cleanings to solubilize biofilms was therefore determined by extracting the eps from the biomass remaining on the membrane spacer surfaces after 1st and 6th cleaning the concentration of proteins was lower in the eps extracted from biomass remaining after urea cleaning as opposed to conventional cleaning fig 3 the protein content was higher after the 6th cleaning cycle indicating the accumulation of bacterial eps over time however the difference was not significant when compared to the 1st cleaning cycle p 0 05 urea hcl cleaning was more effective in solubilizing biofilm proteins than naoh hcl cleaning the feem spectra presented in fig 4 show the changes in biofilm eps composition after chemical cleaning the four regions of feem plots are i humic like substances ex 320 nm em 425 nm ii protein like matter ex 275 nm em 330 nm iii fulvic acid like substances ex 260 nm em 475 nm and iv tyrosine containing proteins ex 235 nm em 330 nm the feem plot of the uncleaned control membrane spacer shows a distinct peak for protein like substances and a strong peak for tyrosine containing substances which are typically proteinaceous and associated with amino acids fig 4 both peaks ii and iv were present at a much lower intensity on the membranes treated by chemical cleaning the peak intensities were higher in the spectra of eps extracted after 6 cleaning cycles compared to 1 cleaning cycle indicating a build up of biofilm associated eps with time as also reported for total proteins analysis in fig 3 after the 6th cleaning cycle with naoh hcl and urea hcl the average peak intensity for the protein like matter was reduced by 40 and 66 respectively while the average peak intensity for tyrosine containing proteins was reduced by 21 and 45 respectively compared to the uncleaned control in other words compared to the conventional acid alkali cleaning treatment urea based cleaning protocols were able to solubilize protein like substances and tyrosine containing proteins more effectively indicating higher biofilm cleaning efficiency on the contrary the eps of urea treated biofilms showed higher peaks of humic like substances and fulvic acid like substances 15 519 and 81 056 counts per second microampere respectively compared to the eps of naoh treated biofilms 11 287 and 63 838 counts per second microampere respectively 3 4 microbial community composition the bacterial community composition for biofilms after the 1st and 6th cleaning cycles compared to the control is shown in fig 5 from the phylum to class level the results presented are averaged from duplicate mfs experiments and the data was reproducible in both experiments the dominant phylum was proteobacteria in all biofilms ranging in relative abundance from 82 to 96 the phylum bacteroidetes was present at a much lower abundance in the chemically cleaned biofilms ranging from 0 6 to 4 6 the bacterial community was least diverse after the 6th cleaning cycle with urea in which proteobacteria accounted for 96 of the bacterial community and only 1 6 unclassified bacteria comparatively in the control biofilm the relative abundance of proteobacteria and unclassified bacteria was 82 and 17 respectively indicating a more diverse microbial composition at the class level β proteobacteria was predominant across all biofilms fig 5b compared to the uncleaned control the relative abundance of β proteobacteria decreased slightly after the 1st and 6th cleaning cycle with naoh 57 and 59 respectively but increased after cleaning with urea 79 and 83 respectively the second most dominant class was α proteobacteria which was present at a higher abundance in the biofilms treated with naoh 14 25 than with urea 3 5 thirdly γ proteobacteria increased in abundance in mature biofilms sequenced after 6 cleaning cycles 8 in comparison with membranes cleaned once and the control 1 7 3 6 the most dominant families across all levels were comamonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae of the β lineage fig 6 comamonadaceae were highly abundant in the control and biofilms treated with naoh ranging from 37 53 and less abundant in biofilms treated with urea 16 33 on the contrary rhodocyclaceae which dominated the urea treated biofilms 43 65 were less abundant in the control and naoh treated biofilms ranging from 5 17 in the α lineage of proteobacteria the most abundant family was sphingomonadaceae in the control 9 6 and biofilm after 1 cleaning cycle with naoh 18 however the abundance decreased remarkably in biofilms treated with urea 1 7 2 9 and after 6 cleaning cycles with naoh 2 8 comparatively pseudomonadaceae of the γ lineage were more abundant in mature biofilms sequenced after 6 cleaning cycles 3 4 5 9 than all other biofilms 0 8 1 0 also from the γ lineage xanthomonadaceae was the most abundant in the mature biofilm obtained after 6 cleaning cycles with naoh 5 3 5 bacterial diversity the shannon weaver diversity index h is an estimate of the alpha bacterial diversity and it increases as both species richness and evenness increase the diversity index table 3 increased after 6 cleaning cycles with naoh 2 7 and decreased after 6 cleaning cycles with urea 1 8 compared to the control biofilm 2 5 the bacterial community was the least diverse and more homogenous after the 6th cleaning cycle with urea under toxic conditions for example at excessively high concentrations of pharmaceuticals microorganisms lose their vitality which in turn leads to a decline of biodiversity song et al 2020 possibly the saturated urea solution 1340 g lwater exerts a similar toxic shock to the microorganisms the non phylogenetic diversity is represented in fig 7 showing reproducible data from duplicate mfs experiments principal component analysis pca showed that the uncleaned control c and biofilm sequenced after 1st cleaning with naoh n1 clustered together along the pc1 and pc2 axes suggesting that the microbial community was very similar as the biofilm matured over 6 cleaning cycles with naoh n6 it was observed in a separate cluster close to that of c and n1 suggesting that the microbial communities were similar but with some differences this distinct clustering is because the bacterial population responds to repeated chemical stresses and evolves to confer resistance to the cleaning agents the microbial community in biofilms treated with 1 or 6 cleaning cycles with urea u1 and u6 was very different from the c and n samples indicating that the type of chemical cleaning agent influences the microbial community composition 4 discussion the setback with conventional chemical cleaning strategies is their failure to remove fouling deposits from the membrane and spacer surfaces entirely not only does this prevent the restoration of membrane performance indicators such as feed channel pressure drop but it also results in rapid biofilm regrowth post cleaning dead biomass often remains on the membrane surface as such killing only does not help to recover flux flemming 2020 the inactivated biomass post cleaning serves as food for microorganisms surviving the cleaning while the collapsed biofilm layer and eps provide a conditioned surface for immediate microbial colonization after chemical cleaning bereschenko et al 2011 vrouwenvelder et al 2011 several researchers have highlighted the need for novel cleaning strategies targeting biomass removal for biofouling control bereschenko et al 2011 sadekuzzaman et al 2015 beyer et al 2017 this study investigated the effects of multiple cleaning cycles with an alternative chemical urea a chaotropic agent in comparison with conventional cleaning to enhance the removal of biomass and resistant microbial communities 4 1 biomass inactivation adenosine triphosphate atp a measure of active biomass content was almost 1 log lower after 1 and 6 cleaning cycles with urea compared to naoh fig 2a urea molecules are capable of diffusing into the biofilm space and bacterial cells leading to osmotic lysis rasmussen et al 2016 thus higher inactivation of biomass the fact that there was no significant difference between the atp content measured after 1 and 6 cleaning cycles hints at the possibility that there might be a certain threshold of inactivation based on the cleaning duration at a specified concentration and temperature in practice the chemical cleaning duration is almost always longer than 1 hour between 6 24 hours consisting of several phases of high flow recirculation and soaking beyer et al 2017 it would be beneficial to experiment with a longer contact time than 1 hour with concentrated urea solution at a temperature of 35 c following industry guidelines 4 2 biomass removal unlike atp the toc content was higher after 6 cleaning cycles with either chemical suggesting the accumulation of biomass over time fig 2b however biomass removal was consistently greater with urea cleaning indicated by a lower toc content compared to the conventional cleaning which allowed for greater biomass accumulation with time inefficient biomass removal from the membrane spacer surface and from the membrane installation is the core issue of conventional chemical cleaning as documented by several authors and reiterated by this study eventually leading to irreversibly fouled membranes requiring early membrane replacement creber et al 2010 a build up of biomass over time is also illustrated by the increase in feed channel pressure drop fig 1 restoration of membrane performance after chemical cleaning was monitored by measuring feed channel pressure drop reduction after the 3rd cleaning cycle a downward trend was observed with either chemical cleaning in terms of restoring the pressure drop in other words a decline in membrane performance is a result of biomass eps accumulation over time indicated by higher toc content reduction in performance restoration was expected since a gradual loss of membrane system performance is inevitable after extended operation bucs et al 2018 however urea cleaning is more effective than conventional cleaning in terms of maintaining the membrane system performance in the long run by i reducing biomass accumulation and ii reducing its impact on membrane performance a substantial increase in the removal of biomass with urea is most likely because urea disintegrates the biofilm eps the strongest structural framework of biofilms as discussed below a small improvement in the cleaning efficiency will make a difference for the performance of full scale desalination membrane installations pairing and alternating physical and chemical cleaning methods may be more effective in removing the fouling deposits that are solubilized by urea periodic air water cleaning cornelissen et al 2007 alpatova et al 2020 for example could help reverse the downward trend observed for pressure drop restoration after the 3rd chemical cleaning cycles moreover the use of geometrically modified feed spacer designs may enable better cleaning as well kerdi et al 2018 4 3 biomass solubilization in agreement with our previous study which demonstrated enhanced biofilm solubilization by urea cleaning 1 cycle sanawar et al 2018 the results of this study also validate the superior efficiency of urea for biofilm protein solubilization for multiple cleaning cycles the concentration of proteins was lower after cleaning with urea for 1 and 6 cleaning cycles compared to the conventional cleaning fig 3 similarly feem analysis revealed that the peak intensities of protein like matter and tyrosine containing proteins on the membrane spacer surface were significantly lower after urea cleaning fig 4 the attachment and aggregation of proteins on the membrane surface have been shown to accelerate fouling kelly and zydney 1995 urea acts as protein denaturant by i forcing the unfolding of proteins and ii preventing the formation of protein aggregates by blocking the free sulfhydryl group which are essential for aggregation reactions kelly and zydney 1994 chemical cleaning with urea thereby minimizes the accumulation of proteinaceous foulants on the membrane surface and also weakens the eps structure by disintegrating one of its main components furthermore extracellular proteins can also increase the hydrophobicity of eps due to their high proportions of hydrophobic amino acids higgins and novak 1997 flemming et al 2000 urea diminishes the hydrophobic effect by encouraging solvation of hydrophobic groups zou et al 1998 bennion and daggett 2003 zangi et al 2009 wang et al 2014 in effect urea cleaning makes the eps layer less hydrophobic and more water soluble making it easier to remove during chemical cleaning this decrease in the eps hydrophobicity also enhances the flow and transport of chemical solutions through the biofilm structure further increasing the cleaning efficiency humic acids are complex organic constituents of soils and water and have little solubility below ph 8 davies et al 1995 this may explain why humic like substances were solubilized better with naoh ph 12 than with urea cleaning solution ph 9 6 increasing the ph of saturated urea solution could be considered fulvic acids are soluble in water independent of the ph they are natural amphiphilic polymers that aid in bacterial detachment from interfaces neu and lawrence 2010 recently it was reported that the higher presence of fulvic acids in the biofilm grown at a lower phosphorus concentration helped solubilize and detach the biofilm from the membrane and spacer javier et al 2021 based on this knowledge we suggest that higher protein solubilization together with the presence of more soluble and amphiphilic polymers in the eps enhances the solubilization of biofilms by urea cleaning urea s higher protein solubilization benefits the removal of the whole biofilm matrix including the polysaccharides as urea creates a loose fouling layer that allows for deeper penetration of hcl into the biofilm consequently enhancing the solubilization of all the deposits it would be worth performing direct measurements of the biofilm mechanical strength to better understand the mechanism of urea cleaning on the biofilm layer 4 4 microbial communities and biofilm resistance microbial community analysis using next generation 16s rrna gene sequencing revealed that proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all samples while bacteroidetes was the second most abundant phylum fig 5 similar microbial community compositions were reported by two previous studies that applied 16s rrna pyrosequencing belila et al 2016 and shotgun metagenomics sequencing rehman et al 2019 approach to investigate the microbial ecology of the kaust desalination ro plant the feed water used in this study is the product of the same ro plant the results are also in agreement with several studies from around the world which demonstrate that proteobacteria dominate seawater associated bacterial communities and also fouled ro membranes bereschenko et al 2008 manes et al 2011 nagaraja et al 2017 studies on early biofilm formation have identified members of proteobacteria dang and lovell 2000 lee et al 2008 followed by bacteroidetes salta et al 2013 as the primary surface colonizers which explains their high abundance pinto et al 2019 the results indicate a relatively uniform bacterial community in the urea treated biofilms as opposed to naoh treated biofilms future studies could examine whether the higher phylogenetic similarity of biofilms post urea treatment may lead to better biofouling control the relative abundance of three main classes of the phylum proteobacteria was in the following order β proteobacteria α proteobacteria γ proteobacteria from the β lineage the families comamonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae were highly abundant fig 6 members of both the families have been identified as key denitrifiers khan et al 2002 bellini et al 2017 dong et al 2019 and commonly reported in microbial communities in activated sludge systems sadaie et al 2007 tandoi et al 2017 research has shown that nitrate reducing bacteria play an important role in the formation of biofilms on ro membranes pang and liu 2007 nagaraja et al 2017 biofilms are known to contain anoxic regions in which such nitrate reducing bacteria can thrive von ohle et al 2010 the availability of nitrate in the feed water rehman et al 2019 and the substrate provides means of sustaining the denitrifiers and suggests that nitrate reduction plays a significant role in the survival of biofilm microbial community post chemical cleaning in addition three families of proteobacteria are of particular importance in relation to biofouling erythrobacteraceae and sphingomonadaceae both representing the order sphingomonadales from the α lineage and xanthomonadaceae from the γ lineage microbial community members belonging to these families are known to produce adhesive eps which also serves as a medium for the attachment and growth for other microorganisms bereschenko et al 2010 nagaraja et al 2017 el beaino et al 2018 sphingomonadaceae that are dominant during biofilm initiation and maturation in ro membranes produce eps with high mechanical and heat resistance de vries et al 2019 some members of the family sphingomonadaceae can even survive autoclaving ashtaputre and shah 1995 while others produce gel like eps called sphingans which enhance cell adhesion and provide strong rigidity gutman et al 2014 schmid et al 2015 it is known that members of the sphingomonadaceae family are able to persist membrane cleaning bereschenko et al 2010 the genome sequences of xanthomonadaceae contain many genes for the formation of surface adhesive structures which results in the aggregation and increased resistance of biofilms to various stresses mhedbi hajri et al 2011 the relative abundance of sphingomonadaceae doubled after 1 cleaning cycle with naoh compared to the control fig 6 after 6 cleaning cycles with naoh the relative abundance of sphingomonadaceae decreased significantly however erythrobacteraceae and xanthomonadaceae become more pronounced instead comparatively the relative abundance of the families mentioned above was negligible after cleaning with urea in other words naoh cleaning resulted in the selection of microbial communities that produce adhesive and resistant eps whereas urea cleaning did not pseudomonadaceae proliferated in mature biofilms even after chemical cleaning with urea 6 relative abundance members belonging to the family pseudomonadaceae produce large amounts of eps barnes et al 2014 although no pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected at the species level the diversity of the biofilm microbial community after urea cleaning remained lower than that after naoh cleaning suggesting that only a fraction of the population survived the urea cleaning procedure biofilm ageing under representative conditions for ro membranes in practice is an important factor in anti fouling research that requires particular attention 4 5 recovery and reuse of urea initial experiments carried out in collaboration with delft university of technology successfully recovered urea crystals from the waste cleaning solution using eutectic freeze crystallization efc alexopoulos 2018 the preliminary study also revealed that impurities are not embedded inside the crystalline structure of urea thus washing of the crystals can effectively increase the purity of recovered urea alexopoulos 2018 the optimization of the efc process including scale up of the efc reactor to 100 l is an ongoing study examining the purity of the recovered urea crystals using more accurate and advanced analytical techniques will be carried out this would allow for urea to be reused after the removal of impurities not only is urea a cheap chemical to purchase but if it can be reused for cleaning it presents an excellent opportunity for ro plants to reduce the volume of chemical waste and costs associated with transport storage and discharge of chemicals an environmental risk assessment is in fact needed to evaluate the use and reuse of cleaning chemicals conventional and urea based for full scale ro membrane filtration installations examining the efficiency cost and environmental impact of chemical cleaning strategies 4 6 outlook biofilms are highly complex and their physical chemical and microbial composition may vary from one plant to another biofilm formation is influenced by a wide variety of factors such as feed water quality pretreatment methods operating conditions and cleaning protocols chemical cleaning with urea may not apply to all types of biofilms for efficient biofouling control it may be suggested to i understand the site specific processes influencing biofilm formation ii implement preventive control strategies such as effective pretreatment to delay biofouling and iii examine biofouling characteristics to select the most effective membrane cleaning method it is known that biofilm eps composition can vary with age nutrient availability in feed water and membrane surface properties javier et al 2021 for example jafari et al 2020 studied two full scale ro installations one in belgium and one in the netherlands and concluded that biofilm developed in full scale modules contain protein rich eps however beyer et al 2017 measured the eps composition for three full scale ro installations in the netherlands and reported polysaccharide rich eps from biofilms developed in full scale ro plants it would be useful to study the impact of urea on protein rich versus polysaccharide rich biofilms sodium alginate a hydrophilic microbial polysaccharide could also be used as a model for organic fouling katsoufidou et al 2007 membrane cleaning is only one of the curative aspects of biofouling control preventive biofouling control strategies such as modifications of membrane spacer surfaces to reduce biofilm growth and adhesion should also be studied in combination with the cleanability of resulting biofilms the chemical mechanism and possible modifications of the urea hcl cleaning method should be explored pairing or alternating urea cleaning with a chemical agent that has a complementary cleaning mechanism could enhance biofilm removal possibly eliminating the development of microorganisms resistant to a certain chemical information is clearly needed about the biofilm reinforcement over long term periods with and without the impact of series of cleanings as potentially can be applied in full scale spiral wound ro installations lab scale simulation studies often use chemicals for cleanings that cannot be used in practice because of legislative restrictions such studies could be done with well defined feed water to eliminate the role of seasonal variations e g algal bloom affecting chemical dosages and pretreatment operation whilst focusing first on biofilm development with time without cleanings for such studies choices must be made with regards to the scope objective and feasibility of the research question parameters of relevance are biomass quantification parameters eps adherence properties jafari et al 2020 biofilm mechanical strength and the microbial community composition aside from the conventional organic solvents a relatively new and green alternative is the natural deep eutectic solvents nades dai et al 2013 a mixture of nades may be prepared with urea and other natural compounds such as organic acids amino acids and sugars which could possibly have the potential to solubilize the macromolecules of biofilms similarly combining urea cleaning with an intermittent physical cleaning cycle could also be highly beneficial urea creates a loose fouling layer that would not only be more readily attacked by subsequent chemicals but would also be more effectively removed by physical cleaning lab scale studies should also aim to clean at the early stages of biofouling and examine the differences in biofilms that form without biodegradable nutrient dosage to the feed water in situ imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography may elicit important biofilm structural characteristics fortunato et al 2017 hou et al 2019 the two major advantages of urea as a chemical cleaning agent are that it i denatures proteins aiding in better chemical penetration for an enhanced overall biofilm disintegration and ii reduces the relative abundance of key biofouling microorganisms such as sphingomonads both these aspects of urea cleaning aid increased solubilization of the eps matrix resulting in deeper cleaning higher biomass removal and reduced impact on membrane performance during extended membrane operation this suggests that urea cleaning could prevent the financially daunting risk of early membrane replacement the recycling and reuse of urea also provides an opportunity for greener chemical cleaning and reducing the costs associated with cleaning the recrystallization of urea from the waste solution has been successful using eutectic freeze crystallization optimization of the crystallization procedure and an investigation of the purity of reclaimed urea crystals is currently being pursued to sum up a urea based cleaning strategy outperforms conventional chemical cleaning consistently during short and long term membrane operations it is an inexpensive and effective approach to control the biological fouling of reverse osmosis membrane systems demonstrated at lab scale and pilot scale 5 conclusions membrane fouling simulators mimicking the structure and hydraulics of industrial spiral wound reverse osmosis membrane modules were used to carry out accelerated biofilm formation by dosing a biodegradable nutrient solution to the feed the effects of multiple chemical cleaning cycles by conventional alkali acid combination and urea hcl were studied for biomass removal and microbial community composition the following conclusions were drawn based on the results chemical cleaning with urea provides higher inactivation and removal of biomass proteinaceous foulants are solubilized and removed much more efficiently with urea cleaning compared to the conventional cleaning although a gradual accumulation of biomass may be inevitable with increasing membrane operation time chemical cleaning with urea reduces biomass accumulation and reduces its impact on membrane performance during extended operation much better than the conventional cleaning urea cleaning does not select for resistant microbial communities on the membrane that are known to be largely responsible for biofouling such as sphingomonads through the extensive production of adhesive eps further optimization of the urea cleaning protocol is recommended to include a different combination of secondary chemical s and or intermittent physical chemical
