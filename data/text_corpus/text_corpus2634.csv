13170,photocatalysis coupled with microbial fuel cell photo mfc is a promising technology that can be applied for reducing pollutants e g hexavalent chromium cr vi while generating power with wastewater by photocathode under visible light however exploring effective and inexpensive catalysts for enhancing the photocathode performance is a challenge in a photo mfc system herein ultrathin mxenes ti3c2 nanosheets were fabricated through ultrasonic etching of ti3alc2 for photocathode catalysts and the reduction of cr vi was also investigated by mxenes modified photocathode under visible light the result shows that the efficiency for the cr vi reduction is approximately 72 84 in 72 h and higher than that under dark condition 63 77 or the one without mxenes cathode 60 45 the maximum power density of photo mfc with mxenes modified photocathode under visible light is 702 67 mw m 2 which is higher 41 95 than that in the traditional mfc without mxenes cathode 495 02 mw m 2 in addition with initial concentration of 40 mg l at ph 3 the cr vi reduction efficiency of photo mfc could be as high as 100 after treating for 60 h under visible light this study provides a train of thought for removing cr vi pollution in the water environment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mxene materials photocatalysts mfc hexavalent chromium 1 introduction hexavalent chromium cr vi shows big and potential risks to the environment and human health due its high toxicity solubility and mobility in aqueous systems 1 2 however on the other side trivalent chromium cr iii was found to be less virulent owing to its low solubility bioavailability and mobility in water than cr vi 3 4 therefore various studies on wastewater treatment have focused on the reduction of cr vi to cr iii in recent years 1 5 and several techniques have been extensively used such as ion exchange photocatalytic reduction and electrochemical methods microbial fuel cells mfcs was considered as an emerging bioelectrochemical technology to achieve cr vi remediation 6 7 but the low cell voltage of mfcs leads to the poor cr vi reduction efficiency these concerns can be effectively addressed using photocatalysis coupled with mfcs as it seems to be a promising alternative for simultaneous water pollutants treatment and electricity generation under visible light conditions 8 10 in the photo mfc system the photoinduced holes h at the photocathode could couple with the electrons e from the bioanode generated by electricigens hence the recombination of photo induced carriers h and e could be effectively restrained leading to many e for enhanced cathodic reduction reactions 11 12 therefore it is important to develop the photocathode material which perform both light harvesting and oxygen reduction reaction orr it was reported that n type tio2 semiconductors always behave as photocathode of photo mfc 13 but tio2 only responds to the uv light 14 moreover p type semiconductor materials are indeed suitable to be typically used as photocathodes in the photo mfc system because they are all low band gap electrodes si gap inp cu2o etc which could perform very well under visible light conditions 15 16 however such photoelectrodes always are incorporating rare elements such as in ga or ge and the cost is highly demanding for the fabrication of single crystalline wafers 15 recently as a new family of two dimensional 2d layered transition metal carbides carbonitrides nitrides mxenes have caused widespread concerns due to their unique in plane anisotropic structures superior metal conductivity and hydrophilicity 17 18 in addition mxenes are widely used for their good structural chemical stability and excellent electrical conductivity 19 20 furthermore the exposed groups in mxenes make them not only more suitable heterogeneous catalysts but also suitable anchor points for further modifications with other nanostructures 17 21 and this make them useful in the fields of photoelectrocatalysis 7 22 23 in this work photo mfc with mxene modified photocathodes were explored for investigating the cr vi reduction and power generation of photo mfc under visible light the performances and synergistic effects of ph value initial cr vi concentration and power generation were also studied 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation of the mxene photocatalytic electrogenic cathode 1 00 g ti3alc2 was added as raw material into 100 ml of 40 60 and 80 hf solution by volume respectively the mixtures were stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 24 h 48 h 72 h and 96 h under 30 c respectively obtained mxene materials were then washed by a certain amount of ethanol followed by ultrasonic cleaning for 30 min with deionized water until the ph is neutral then the washed mxene materials were dried for 12 h at 60 c the collected materials are named as mx 40 24 mx 40 48 mx 40 72 mx 40 96 mx 60 24 mx 60 48 mx 60 72 mx 60 96 mx 80 24 mx 80 48 mx 80 72 mx 80 96 respectively 2 2 configuration and operation of photo mfc the photo mfc system was comprised by two chambers and physically separated by a cation exchange membrane 9 cm2 cmi 7000 menbrabes international inc us the schematic diagram and photograph of photo mfc are shown in fig 1 the system was assembled by two half cube structures a total volume of 28 26 ml was constituted by anode chamber and cathode chamber to build photo mfc the anode electrode 1 1 0 5 cm3 was made with carbon felt q carbon co ltd shanghai china while the cathode electrode 1 1 0 5 cm3 was prepared by carbon felt loaded mxene the carbon rod was used for linking anode and cathode with an external resistor of 1000 ω saturated calomel electrode sces spsic rex instrument factory china was plugged as the reference electrode the carbon felt cathode electrode loaded with photocatalyst mxene was facing to external light illumination the mfc with carbon felt electrode without mxene was set up for control experiment the experimental data were collected while photo mfc and mfc were working under identical operational conditions with or without light illumination 2 3 analysis and calculations the morphology and structure of the mxene were captured by fesem hitachi su8010 japan with an accelerating voltage of 5 kv the crystal structure was investigated on a d max rb x ray diffractometer d8 advance bruker japan 60 kv 80 ma 2θ 5 90 xps was operated on vg excalab 250xi uk electron spectrometer with al kα radiation the uv vis absorption spectra of the two samples were obtained by diffuse reflection spectra drs jasco uv 550 the specific surface area and pore size distribution were investigated by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms on a quantachrome instrument quantachrome autosorb iq usa photoluminescence spectra pl of the catalysts were carried out on a spectrophotometer fsl980 edinburgh instruments the cell voltage of photo mfc and mfc were recorded by the data acquisition system mps 010602 icp das co ltd every 30 min the previous reports showed that people used the effective electrode surface to work out the power density 24 after the stabilization of voltage outputs it makes the1000 ω external resistance change to the 20 ω one in order to obtain the polarization 25 since 1 5 diphenylcarbazide colorimetric method is suitable at 540 nm we used uv vis spectrophotometer s1020 shanghai tianmei scientific instrument co ltd to measure the concentration of cr vi 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the mxene loaded the cathode of photo mfc studies have confirmed that mx 80 48 has a good reduction rate of cr vi in photocatalysis 26 therefore mx 80 48 was characterized by sem also the materials with the same etching time mx 40 48 mx 60 48 the same hf concentration mx 80 24 mx 80 72 mx 80 96 and the raw materials ti3alc2 were also characterized by sem as shown in fig 2a after etching for 48 h under 40 of hf by volume the stratification cannot be obviously observed however when the concentration of hf increases to 60 by volume and the etching time remains unchanged fig 2b the delamination of the material is gradually observed and the thickness of the nano layer ranges from 50 nm 200 nm under the condition of 80 hf volume concentration and 48 h etching time fig 2c the delamination of the material is more obvious and uniform and the thickness of the nano layer is thinner about 20 nm 50 nm with the appearance of arch 27 and scroll 28 however when the hf concentration is 80 and the etching time is shortened to 24 h fig 2d it is found that the etching delamination is not as obvious as for mx 80 48 when the volume concentration of hf is 80 and the etching time is increased to 72 h fig 2e and 96 h fig 2f the etching layer of the material is not more obvious and there are some particles around the material the particle size is about 20 nm 100 nm compared with mx 80 48 fig 2c and raw material ti3alc2 fig 2g the layer thickness is about 20 nm 50 nm without hf etching which is basically the same as mx 80 48 therefore it can be explained that under the condition of 80 hf volume concentration and 48 h etching the two dimensional layer is basically completed and the original framework of ti3alc2 is basically retained it can be seen from fig 2h the eds result proves that there are ti c and o elements in the mx 80 48 material o element is due to the hydrophilicity of mxene which adsorbs oxygen functional groups on the surface 29 in addition it can be concluded that the al layer was completely etched away in order to further define the chemical composition and element valence of mx 80 48 material the material was detected and analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the survey xps spectrum of mx 80 48 is shown in fig 3a in accordance with eds results the spectrum is also able to witness the peaks of c 1s o 1s and ti 2p among them the o and f elements are derived from the exogenous substances introduced during the hf etching of ti3alc2 in addition the sample does not contain al element which shows that the sample had been completely etched the c 1s spectrum of mx 80 48 fig 3b shows two peaks at 282 11 ev and 284 79 ev which are attributed to cti and cc bonds respectively 30 31 the o 1s spectrum is shown in fig 3c demonstrating that the characteristic peaks at 529 97 ev and 532 17 ev are attributed to oti and c ti oh x bonds respectively 32 33 the result indicates that the o element mainly exists in the form of o2 34 35 relevant studies have proved that these oxygen elements are oxygen containing functional groups produced by the etching process 36 the xps results of the ti 2p pattern of mx 80 48 are shown in fig 3d the peaks located at 455 42 ev 456 75 ev 461 3 ev and 462 17 ev could be assigned to ti ii 2p3 2 ti iii 2p3 2 ti ii 2p1 2 and ti iii 2p1 2 respectively 37 38 the optical properties of mx 80 48 and ti3alc2 were investigated by uv vis drs and photoluminescence pl fig 4a mx 80 48 material exhibits strong light absorption in the visible light range from 400 nm to 800 nm the bandgap energy eg of mx 80 48 is 1 07 ev fig 4a inset calculated by the tauc plot meanwhile according to the xps valence band evb spectrum the vb position of mx 80 48 is about 1 61 ev fig 4c and the corresponding conduction band ecb position of mx 80 48 is 0 54 ev in fig 4b the pl spectra of mx 80 48 and ti3alc2 show a strong emission peak at about 460 nm the lowest pl intensity of mx 80 48 indicates that photogenerated carrier migrates faster after the ti3alc2 etching the flat band potential under the dark conditions can be investigated by mott schottky ms curves as shown in fig 4d the slope of mx 80 48 is negative which implies that mx 80 48 is a p type semiconductor 39 the flat band potential efb is 0 286 v vs ag agcl and was investigated via mott schottky plots fig 4d by extrapolating the plots to the bias axis in order to investigate the transmission impedance and separation efficiency of the photogenerated electrons and holes of mx 80 48 the ac impedance spectroscopy eis of the material was analyzed under dark and light 0 1 hz 30 khz conditions as shown in fig 5a the radius of the impedance arc under dark state is very large however the radius of the impedance arc is greatly reduced under light conditions indicating the generation of the photogenerated electrons and holes are rapidly separated thus reducing the transmission impedance of the internal charge in addition through the linear sweep voltammogram lsv curves fig 5b the material has a higher current density under light conditions at the same time cr vi was used as the electron acceptor in the nitrogen saturated 0 05 m n2so4 solution to test the cyclic voltammetry curve fig 5c contrary to dark conditions a reduction peak around 0 3 v vs rhe can be observed under light environments which proves that the material has the ability to photoelectrically reduce cr vi 3 2 electrochemical performance of photo mfc the photo mfc with mxene as cathode material and a control group mfc without mxene were operated for 72 h after the acclimation stage and the cathodic solution was illuminated under visible light after 30 min aeration cr vi solution with a concentration of 40 mg l were injected to the cathode chambers of photo mfc and mfc fig 6a indicates the electricity generation of photo mfc and mfc with an external resistance of 1000 ω the results show that the maximum output voltage of photoelectric mfc is 0 339 v which is higher than mfc 0 296 v fig 6b shows the power density and polarization curves compared to the peak power density in the mfc that is 495 02 mw m 2 and the one in the photo mfc is 41 95 higher to achieve 702 67 mw m 2 in addition the other electrochemical parameters of photo mfc were higher than that in the mfc table 1 the mxene is a two dimensional nanomaterial with graphene like morphology gained by etching the precursor of max phase ti3alc2 as a good conductor max is stripped of an atom layer during etching but the conductivity of mxene retains the characteristics of its precursor it was reported that mxene materials exhibit good metal properties and excellent conductivity 40 42 the results also demonstrate that mxenes are showing a strong interfacial interaction and rapid charge transfer kinetic compared to max 43 moreover as visible light activated photocatalysts mx 80 48 will release photogenerated holes hvb and photogenerated electrons ecb under the irradiation of the external light source to a certain extent the generation of hvb can be used as electron acceptor thereby accelerating the electron conduction from anode to cathode in photo mfc 3 3 cr vi removal of photo mfc to explore the advantages of photo mfc the cr vi removal efficiency in the photo mfc were studied as fig 7 showed cr vi removal efficiency for photo mfc and mfcs were analyzed in a closed circuit system under dark and illumination environment all cathode chambers were injected with 40 mg l cr vi solution as catholyte at ph 5 the removing efficiency of cr vi by mfcs under light conditions 60 45 is slightly different from that under dark conditions 58 38 the result showed that as the cathode electrode carbon felt without loading materials do not respond to visible light the cr vi reduction efficiency of photo mfc was analyzed in the open circuit system under the dark environment as shown in fig s4 there is no significant change in the content of cr vi and cr iii under dark and open circuit conditions therefore the reduction of cr vi in the cathode chamber is due to the fact that cr vi acts as an electron acceptor and it can receive electrons from the anode the reaction equations are shown as follows 1 anode chamber c h 3 co o 4 h 2 o 2 hc o 3 9 h 8 e 2 hco ₃ oh h ₂ o co ₃ 2 neutral and alkaline 3 hco 3 h co ₃ 2 acidic 4 cathode chamber cr 2 o 7 2 14 h 6 e 2 cr 3 7 h 2 o in contrast cr vi removal efficiency is 63 77 in photo mfc operated for 72 h without illumination which is higher than that in the mfc system the results show that mx 80 48 exhibits excellent electrical conductivity and lower resistivity leading to less ohmic loss of electrons in the transmission process hence the improvement of the cr vi removing efficiency the removing efficiency of cr vi reached 72 84 in the photo mfc with illumination which is 9 07 higher than that produced from the photo mfc without illumination the results indicate that mx 80 48 not only acts as the cathode catalyst but also responds to visible light the surface of the mx 80 48 will generate photogenerated holes hvb and photogenerated electrons ecb which reacts with cr2o7 2 to increase the removing efficiency of cr vi in the cathode solution finally further experiments have been carried out to prove the existence of cr iii as shown in fig s5 with the reaction progress the ratio of cr iii to the total chromium gradually increased proving that cr vi was reduced to cr iii as shown in fig 7 the cr vi removing efficiency in the photo mfc with illumination is 16 47 higher than that in the traditional mfc after operating for 72 h the difference is achieved by 5 95 in the first 12 h indicating that the reduction rate reached the maximum value in this stage mx 80 48 acts as the catalyst in the reaction after the generation of hvb and ecb under light conditions the hvb combined with the electrons e and transmitted from the anode thus accelerating the separation of hvb and ecb therefore the reaction proceeds in a positive direction more ecb participated in the cr vi reduction reaction however after 12 h both hvb and ecb cannot be recombined again after participating in the reaction therefore the reduction of cr vi to cr iii in 12 72 h mainly comes from the electrons provided by anode and the principle is the same as that of photo mfc without illumination the main reaction equations in the reaction process are listed as follows fig 8 5 0 12 h stage t i 3 c 2 hν t i 3 c 2 h vb e cb 6 t i 3 c 2 h vb e cb e e cb 7 c r 2 o 7 2 14 h e cb 2 cr 3 7 h 2 o 8 2 h e h 2 9 12 72 h stage c r 2 o 7 2 14 h e cb 2 cr 3 7 h 2 o 10 2 h e h 2 3 3 1 effect of initial concentration on the cr vi removal by photo mfc system in order to study the effect of different initial concentrations of cr vi in the cathode chamber of photo mfc system on the cr vi removal the concentration of cr vi was prepared at 40 60 and 80 mg l as shown in the fig 9 the removal efficiency of cr vi was 72 84 after 72 h operation in photo mfc system with original concentration of 40 mg l however when other conditions remain unchanged the removal efficiency of cr vi under the initial concentration of 60 mg l and 80 mg l are only 51 95 and 37 89 respectively it may be due to the light absorbed by the cr vi weakening the irradiation to the mxenes photocathode at higher cr vi concentration and consequently leading to the poor reduction efficiency of cr vi 1 44 3 3 2 effect of ph on cr vi removal by photo mfc system to explore the effect of dissimilar ph values in the cathode chamber of photo mfc system on the cr vi removal the concentration was set as 40 mg l the ph of the cathode chamber was adjusted within the scope of 3 7to avoid the inhibition of the microorganisms in anode chamber when the h in the cathode chamber are transferred to the anode chamber at low ph value as shown in fig 10 the cr vi can exhibit 100 conversion rate at ph 3 in the cathode chamber of pcmfc for 60 h nevertheless the removal efficiency decreases to 95 43 at ph 4 for 72 h the removal efficiency of cr vi decreases with the increment of ph value the removal rate of cr vi reduces to the lowest only 6 87 at ph 7 for 72 h from nernst equation the h concentration is increased by 10 times when the ph value reduces by 1 thermodynamically lower ph values could favor the reduction of cr vi to cr iii resulting in higher redox potential 1 hence the easier reduction of cr vi and the speed up the reduction rate of cr vi in the reaction as shown in table 2 our study is compared with other studies obviously these data show that in our study both the reduction rate of cr vi and the power density are significantly higher than those other studies 4 conclusions in summary the photo mfc with ultra thin layered mxenes were obtained via a simple etching method at different hydrofluoric acid concentration and time under visible light irradiation the removing efficiency of cr vi through the reduction reaction to cr iii reached 72 84 in the photo mfc system which is higher than that produced from the photo mfc without illumination moreover the removal efficiency of cr vi would reach up to 100 under a lower original cr vi concentration 40 mg l and ph 3 in addition the peak power density of mxenes modified photocathode in photo mfc achieves 702 67 mw m 2 in comparison to dark conditions 495 02 mw m 2 therefore photo mfc with mxenes photocathode simultaneously improves the cr vi elimination efficiency and power generation this work provides not only a brand new idea for continuous high power output but also environmental remediation solution declaration of

band evb spectrum the vb position of mx 80 48 is about 1 61 ev fig 4c and the corresponding conduction band ecb position of mx 80 48 is 0 54 ev in fig 4b the pl spectra of mx 80 48 and ti3alc2 show a strong emission peak at about 460 nm the lowest pl intensity of mx 80 48 indicates that photogenerated carrier migrates faster after the ti3alc2 etching the flat band potential under the dark conditions can be investigated by mott schottky ms curves as shown in fig 4d the slope of mx 80 48 is negative which implies that mx 80 48 is a p type semiconductor 39 the flat band potential efb is 0 286 v vs ag agcl and was investigated via mott schottky plots fig 4d by extrapolating the plots to the bias axis in order to investigate the transmission impedance and separation efficiency of the photogenerated electrons and holes of mx 80 48 the ac impedance spectroscopy eis of the material was analyzed under dark and light 0 1 hz 30 khz conditions as shown in fig 5a the radius of the impedance arc under dark state is very large however the radius of the impedance arc is greatly reduced under light conditions indicating the generation of the photogenerated electrons and holes are rapidly separated thus reducing the transmission impedance of the internal charge in addition through the linear sweep voltammogram lsv curves fig 5b the material has a higher current density under light conditions at the same time cr vi was used as the electron acceptor in the nitrogen saturated 0 05 m n2so4 solution to test the cyclic voltammetry curve fig 5c contrary to dark conditions a reduction peak around 0 3 v vs rhe can be observed under light environments which proves that the material has the ability to photoelectrically reduce cr vi 3 2 electrochemical performance of photo mfc the photo mfc with mxene as cathode material and a control group mfc without mxene were operated for 72 h after the acclimation stage and the cathodic solution was illuminated under visible light after 30 min aeration cr vi solution with a concentration of 40 mg l were injected to the cathode chambers of photo mfc and mfc fig 6a indicates the electricity generation of photo mfc and mfc with an external resistance of 1000 ω the results show that the maximum output voltage of photoelectric mfc is 0 339 v which is higher than mfc 0 296 v fig 6b shows the power density and polarization curves compared to the peak power density in the mfc that is 495 02 mw m 2 and the one in the photo mfc is 41 95 higher to achieve 702 67 mw m 2 in addition the other electrochemical parameters of photo mfc were higher than that in the mfc table 1 the mxene is a two dimensional nanomaterial with graphene like morphology gained by etching the precursor of max phase ti3alc2 as a good conductor max is stripped of an atom layer during etching but the conductivity of mxene retains the characteristics of its precursor it was reported that mxene materials exhibit good metal properties and excellent conductivity 40 42 the results also demonstrate that mxenes are showing a strong interfacial interaction and rapid charge transfer kinetic compared to max 43 moreover as visible light activated photocatalysts mx 80 48 will release photogenerated holes hvb and photogenerated electrons ecb under the irradiation of the external light source to a certain extent the generation of hvb can be used as electron acceptor thereby accelerating the electron conduction from anode to cathode in photo mfc 3 3 cr vi removal of photo mfc to explore the advantages of photo mfc the cr vi removal efficiency in the photo mfc were studied as fig 7 showed cr vi removal efficiency for photo mfc and mfcs were analyzed in a closed circuit system under dark and illumination environment all cathode chambers were injected with 40 mg l cr vi solution as catholyte at ph 5 the removing efficiency of cr vi by mfcs under light conditions 60 45 is slightly different from that under dark conditions 58 38 the result showed that as the cathode electrode carbon felt without loading materials do not respond to visible light the cr vi reduction efficiency of photo mfc was analyzed in the open circuit system under the dark environment as shown in fig s4 there is no significant change in the content of cr vi and cr iii under dark and open circuit conditions therefore the reduction of cr vi in the cathode chamber is due to the fact that cr vi acts as an electron acceptor and it can receive electrons from the anode the reaction equations are shown as follows 1 anode chamber c h 3 co o 4 h 2 o 2 hc o 3 9 h 8 e 2 hco ₃ oh h ₂ o co ₃ 2 neutral and alkaline 3 hco 3 h co ₃ 2 acidic 4 cathode chamber cr 2 o 7 2 14 h 6 e 2 cr 3 7 h 2 o in contrast cr vi removal efficiency is 63 77 in photo mfc operated for 72 h without illumination which is higher than that in the mfc system the results show that mx 80 48 exhibits excellent electrical conductivity and lower resistivity leading to less ohmic loss of electrons in the transmission process hence the improvement of the cr vi removing efficiency the removing efficiency of cr vi reached 72 84 in the photo mfc with illumination which is 9 07 higher than that produced from the photo mfc without illumination the results indicate that mx 80 48 not only acts as the cathode catalyst but also responds to visible light the surface of the mx 80 48 will generate photogenerated holes hvb and photogenerated electrons ecb which reacts with cr2o7 2 to increase the removing efficiency of cr vi in the cathode solution finally further experiments have been carried out to prove the existence of cr iii as shown in fig s5 with the reaction progress the ratio of cr iii to the total chromium gradually increased proving that cr vi was reduced to cr iii as shown in fig 7 the cr vi removing efficiency in the photo mfc with illumination is 16 47 higher than that in the traditional mfc after operating for 72 h the difference is achieved by 5 95 in the first 12 h indicating that the reduction rate reached the maximum value in this stage mx 80 48 acts as the catalyst in the reaction after the generation of hvb and ecb under light conditions the hvb combined with the electrons e and transmitted from the anode thus accelerating the separation of hvb and ecb therefore the reaction proceeds in a positive direction more ecb participated in the cr vi reduction reaction however after 12 h both hvb and ecb cannot be recombined again after participating in the reaction therefore the reduction of cr vi to cr iii in 12 72 h mainly comes from the electrons provided by anode and the principle is the same as that of photo mfc without illumination the main reaction equations in the reaction process are listed as follows fig 8 5 0 12 h stage t i 3 c 2 hν t

concentration on the cr vi removal by photo mfc system in order to study the effect of different initial concentrations of cr vi in the cathode chamber of photo mfc system on the cr vi removal the concentration of cr vi was prepared at 40 60 and 80 mg l as shown in the fig 9 the removal efficiency of cr vi was 72 84 after 72 h operation in photo mfc system with original concentration of 40 mg l however when other conditions remain unchanged the removal efficiency of cr vi under the initial concentration of 60 mg l and 80 mg l are only 51 95 and 37 89 respectively it may be due to the light absorbed by the cr vi weakening the irradiation to the mxenes photocathode at higher cr vi concentration and consequently leading to the poor reduction efficiency of cr vi 1 44 3 3 2 effect of ph on cr vi removal by photo mfc system to explore the effect of dissimilar ph values in the cathode chamber of photo mfc system on the cr vi removal the concentration was set as 40 mg l the ph of the cathode chamber was adjusted within the scope of 3 7to avoid the inhibition of the microorganisms in anode chamber when the h in the cathode chamber are transferred to the anode chamber at low ph value as shown in fig 10 the cr vi can exhibit 100 conversion rate at ph 3 in the cathode chamber of pcmfc for 60 h nevertheless the removal efficiency decreases to 95 43 at ph 4 for 72 h the removal efficiency of cr vi decreases with the increment of ph value the removal rate of cr vi reduces to the lowest only 6 87 at ph 7 for 72 h from nernst equation the h concentration is increased by 10 times when the ph value reduces by 1 thermodynamically lower ph values could favor the reduction of cr vi to cr iii resulting in higher redox potential 1 hence the easier reduction of cr vi and the speed up the reduction rate of cr vi in the reaction as shown in table 2 our study is compared with other studies obviously these data show that in our study both the reduction rate of cr vi and the power density are significantly higher than those other studies 4 conclusions in summary the photo mfc with ultra thin layered mxenes were obtained via a simple etching method at different hydrofluoric acid concentration and time under visible light irradiation the removing efficiency of cr vi through the reduction reaction to cr iii reached 72 84 in the photo mfc system which is higher than that produced from the photo mfc without illumination moreover the removal efficiency of cr vi would reach up to 100 under a lower original cr vi concentration 40 mg l and ph 3 in addition the peak power density of mxenes modified photocathode in photo mfc achieves 702 67 mw m 2 in comparison to dark conditions 495 02 mw m 2 therefore photo mfc with mxenes photocathode simultaneously improves the cr vi elimination efficiency and power generation this work provides not only a brand new idea for continuous high power output but also environmental remediation solution declaration of

13171,a novel process named single stage pnda that integrates the partial nitritation partial denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation in a single lab scale sequencing batch reactor was developed to treat moderate strength ammonia wastewater 220 mg n l firstly a single stage partial nitritation anammox process was started up with the total nitrogen removal efficiencies of approx 76 22 and the remaining free ammonia concentration could produce a more sustained inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob than low do condition then the proposed one stage pnda process achieved an average total nitrogen removal efficiency of 85 29 by adding sodium acetate in the influent at a concentration of 50 mg cod l microbial community characterization revealed that ammonia oxidizing bacteria anammox bacteria nob and partial denitrification bacteria coexist in the suspended sludge the significant enrichment of thauera and the dominance of ca anammoxoglobus in the anammox biomass indicate their important role in the improved nitrogen removal performance this single stage pnad process can potentially be applied to further improve the total nitrogen removal efficiency of pn a process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords suspended sludge partial nitritation anammox nob inhibition partial denitrificaiton microbial community 1 introduction anammox anaerobic ammonia oxidation has become a hot research topic as a highly efficient and cost saving process to remove nitrogen from wastewater in recent years in the anammox biomass nitrite is reduced to nitrogen gas and ammonia plays the role of electron donor eq 1 1 2 for the annamox reaction to proceed no2 n needs to be generated in a pretreatment step in sewage treatment for this purpose partial nitritation pn is a widely accepted technology 2 4 as an alternative to the conventional biological nitrogen removal method via nitrification denitrification the paritial nitritation coupled with anammox process pn a has been reported to consume 60 less oxygen requires no organic carbon source and produces about 90 less sludge 5 6 1 nh4 n 1 32 no2 n 0 066 hco3 0 13h 1 02 n2 0 26 no3 n 0 066 ch2o0 5n0 15 2 03 h2o due to the above advantages the single stage pn a process is becoming more widely available in the treatment of moderate or high ammonia nitrogen 100 500 mg l wastewater 7 8 the challenge to the acceptance of this process is the high rate of failure during the startup or operation period it is mainly because of the large amount of nitrate produced by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and a low n removal efficiency resulting in high total nitrogen in the effluent 9 11 in recent years it has been reported that nob inhibition can be achieved economically and efficiently by controlling the concentration of dissolved oxygen do and free ammonia fa 12 15 it has also ben reported that the discharging aged flocs or adding chemical inhibitors is also useful to reduce the total nitrogen in the reactor and effluent 3 16 however control of the overall process remains challenging because the nob coexists with ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and other microorganisms 17 in this study a low do and suitable fa were chosen for start up with the aim of stabilizing the pn a process economically and efficiently without the addition of any chemical inhibitors preventing the establishment of nitrate in the pn a system is challenging because of the by products of the anammox reaction besides that completely eliminating nob is considered impossible growing studies have focused on methods to improve the total nitrogen removal via denitrifiers it has been reported that there is a toxic effect of organic substances on anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob as well as promotes the generation of heterotrophic bacteria which competes with anaob resulting in low efficiency of autotrophic nitrogen removal 11 18 in other studies it has been reported that organic matter at a certain concentration does not inhibit anaob activity and can even be used by anaob through a number of different metabolic pathways 19 20 for example the use of acetic acid as an electron acceptor by ca brocadia fulgida and the oxidation of glucose acetic acid and propionic acid by ca brocadia anammoxidans ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis 21 22 in addition the use of carbon sources to achieve partial denitrification pd can reduce no3 n while also simultaneously supplying no2 n for the anammox reaction 23 24 however there are less research on the combined process of pn pd and anammox in a single reactor pnda the relationship between the operation conditions and sludge population structure remains unknown the objectives of this study was to evaluate the effect of do and fa in stabilizing the pn a reactor performance and starting up a single stage pnda process the effects of the operation conditions on the growth of aob nob denitrifier and anaob were also evaluated the results are expected to suggest approaches for improving the nitrogen removal performance of the single stage autotrophic process 2 materials and methods 2 1 sequencing batch reactor sbr and operation a lab scale sbr with an

then a small quantity of anammox biomass 500 ml was added to the system for the start up of the single stage pn a in the second phase the sbr was operated three cycles per day for the duration of the experimental period each cycle consisted of 180 min of operation which included 15 min feeding 305 min aerobic treatment 85 min stirring 60 min settling and 15 min decanting 5 l of synthetic wastewater was pumped into each reactor during the feeding phase 2 2 inoculum sludge and wastewater composition the sbr system was inoculated with activated sludge taken from a local wastewater

prjna766448 3 results 3 1 start up and performance of single stage pn a system 3 1 1 start up of the pn process during the starting procedure of partial nitritation most of the supernatant about 75 in the reactor was discharged at the end of the cycle to reduce the no2 n concentration at the beginning of next period and to reduce the nob proliferation that is from the stirring step to the decanting the reduction in ammonia and nitrite and the increase in nitrate were used to evaluate the system performance as shown in fig 2 during phase 1 1 17 d the inoculated sludge gradually adapted to the system environment and the full nitrification process improved almost all of the ammonia was oxidized to nitrate at the do concentration of 1 0 0 5 mg l pn was achieved with a reduction in the do concentration 0 4 0 1 mg l in phase 2 18 34 d the gradual increase in nar to 73 02 after day 34 suggests that nob was inhibited at this do level this finding is in agreement with the oxygen half saturation constant of aob of 0 20 0 40 mg l 28 in order to enhance the pn process the do concentration was further reduced to 0 25 0 05 mg l in phase 3 35 42 d and then to 0 14 0 06 mg l in phase 4 43 52 d at first a clear reduction in the ammonia consumption and nitrate production was found similar to the response in phase 2 a decrease in nitrite production also occurred at this do level indicating the suppression of aob activity as was also reported by previous study 29 but with the above mentioned suppression reversed in next phase as shown in fig 3 so it was not irreversible in this study afterwards the nar reached a maximum of 83 18 in phase 4 with an average of 80 12 1 51 and a nitrite concentration of approx 28 4 mg l nar showed a trend to gradually increase from 20 to 80 approximately when the do decreased from 1 0 mg l to 0 14 mg l in the reactor fig 2 which demonstrated a inverse correlation between pn and do in this phase 3 1 2 the effect of do and fa concentration on the pn a process at the beginning of stage 2 a portion of the anammox activated sludge 500 ml was added to the reactor to form a single stage pn a system to avoid a negative impact on the seed sludge of anaob in the system the do concentration was controlled at about 0 15 0 20 mg l at the initial phase 53 63 d of operation the no2 n concentration in the effluent went into a steep decline from 42 88 mg l to 5 04 mg l fig 3a and the nh4 n concentration in the effluent increased at first and then decreased fig 3b in the meantime a weak reduction in no3 n was also found fig 3c these phenomena were caused by the death of microbial cell of seeding sludge and the adaptation stage of anammox activated sludge the next phase the no3 n value in effluent increased rapidly along with a marked decrease in nh4 n and no2 n in the post anoxic period these results showed a gradual adaptation of inoculated anaob to the system 30 with the start up of pn a after 50 days in operation an rise in the aor was found meanwhile nlr was increased the nlr increased to about 0 3 kg n m3 d and the aor increased from 0 049 kg n m3 d 64 d to 0 179 kg n m3 d 112 d in the case of nor a massive increase was observed 13 6 times and this appeared to continue to rise fig 4 this was an indication that while nob activity in the one stage pn a can be limited by low do but it cannot be fully suppressed 13 more than that these outcomes indicated that the remaining free ammonia fa concentration at approx 10 40 1 38 mg l in the influent could not produce sustained inhibition of nob even at a do of approx 0 15 mg l further the deterioration in nitrogen performance was caused by high nob activity fig 4 the fa condition was investigated to determine its effect on pn according to previous studies a higher fa improves the performance of pn 12 14 31 as shown in fig 5 the slight increase in the influent ammonia nitrogen concentration to about 250 mg l resulted in a higher fa condition of approx 17 76 mg l subsequently during the operation from days 112 to 133 the average value of fa in the effluent was maintained at 14 86 3 37 mg l during this period after an initial decrease in the aor the aor recovered and no further increase in the nor occurred that is the worsening trend of pn was successfully restrained the consistently low effluent no2 n 0 67 mg l suggests that the fa did not significantly inhibit anaob in this study this result is different from that of an earlier study which found that fa not only suppressed nob but also had an effect anaob 32 in this study early in stage 2 the nre dropped below 40 as indicated in fig 3c it is likely that the main cause for nre reduction was the weakness of the aob or and microbial cell decay during anammox sludge adaptation period which has been reported to lead to a lower concentration of no2 n in effluent and therefore a deteriorated nitrogen removal performance 33 the fa concentration was reduced to its initial level by adjusting the influent nh4 n concentration at 134 d fig 5 subsequently during the operation of the system from days 134 155 d the nre increased to 70 fig 3c a gradual increase in the aor was also observed and the nor remained stable indicating that at a low do concentration level maintaining the concentration of fa above 14 87 3 37 mg l has a strong inhibitory effect on nob and also that the inhibition of aob was reversible fig 4 to determine the effect of the do concentration on the system the aeration was reduced from 0 45 nl min to 0 35 nl min and the do in the reactor was reduced to 0 10 mg l 156 d as shown in fig 3 4 aor nor and effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were intitally relatively stable also the nre was maintained at about 70 at first but with the operation of the reactor the effluent nh4 n concentration began to increase 170 d and a reduction in the aor and nre to 0 095 kg n m3 d and 40 was observed while nor remained stable this is consistent with earlier findings that the oxygen half saturation constant ko2 of aob is 0 07 mg l and that aob could not produce sufficient nitrite for anaob when do concentrations were below the above value 13 34 considering this the long term hypoxia conditioning do 0 08 mg l is not recommended in the implementation of pn a and neither is it suitable for implementing pn governance in the sbr a stable performance of the system was achieved when the aeration rate and do concentration were restored to their original level 184 d this was after a rapid rise in the aor even slightly higher than that before the decrease in the do concentration the nor remained stable but showed a slight downward trend as shown in fig 3c the system effluent no3 n was higher than 34 14 mg l and remained at a high level as the investigation continues 184 209 d the effluent no2 n concentration remained stable 1 01 mg l and the total nitrogen removal efficiency increased to 71 02 during this period 104 209 d the effluent no3 n remained consistently at a higher level approximately 39 12 mg l it infered that there was still a portion of nob in the system which was likely the main reason for the lower nre than theoretical value 89 therefore if pd could be combined with this pn a process to convert nitrate to nitrite the nitrogen removal capacity would be improved 3 2 start up of the single stage pnda process to combine partial denitrifiction with pn a to start up a single stage pnda process at 210 days sodium acetate was added in infflent with a cod of 50 mg l codinf nh4 ninf about 0 22 while no significant change in the nitrogen removal performance in this system was observed in the initial stages at 215 d the effluent concentration of no3 n had decreased markedly after 221 d the concentration of nh4 n began to decrease significantly and the concentration of no2 n began to increase indicating a proliferation of denitrifying bacteria in the system and a gradual increase in the tn removal efficiency it is also possible that partial denitrification no3 n to no2 n pd was realized 24 or the process of partial nitrification was enhanced by the presence of heterotrophic aob such as the ohtaekwangia genus in the system 35 according to a comprehensive analysis of stoichiometry during feeding phase and early aeration phase no3 n decreased gradually with the no2 n accumulated it is almost certain that pd process has been started up in the pn a system at 225 d however the concentration of no3 n increased from 16 95 mg l to 21 18 mg l fig 3c this rise in no3 n can likely be attributed to the complete consumption of the nh4 n in the system at the end of the aeration phase resulting in a lack of the electron donors necessary for the anammox process this is despite a no2 n concentration of 8 4 mg l in the effluent this excess nitrogen was likely used in the matrix of the nob on the whole a single stage pnda process has been achieved accumulated no3 n from pn a process was further removed via the combination of anammox and pd processes so that the nitrogen removal performance was enhanced accordingly try to keep the above issues in perspective more organic carbon might be able to reduce the concentration of no3 n effectively 24 36 at 263 d the cod in the influent was further increased to 100 mg l c n 0 43 as shown in fig 3a the nh4 n and no2 n concentrations in the effluent remained stable and the nitrate concentration decreased to below 5 0 mg l in the case of nre a significant upward trend was observed with a peak reached at about 95 10 283 d and then a gradual decrease over time from these results it can be concluded that increasing the cod in the influent to 100 mg l can have short term benefits but that these benefits are unsustainable in the long run 3 3 microbial structure characteristics high throughput sequencing was carried out to determine the microbial structure of the community the results indicate that 26 phylums were detected in the system after partial nitrification 52 d proteobacteria which was shown to be the dominant phylum include several genus related to nitrogen removal at the genus level the unclassified genus was as high as 53 51 nitrosomonas was found at an relative abundance of 3 93 and nitrospira was 0 4 these genus are known be involved in the pn a initiation phase 37 38 this is the most obvious sign of the success in obtaining partial nitrification by enriching aob and eliminating nob effectively however the many other genus indicate the complexity of the system fig 6a in addition armatimonadetes gp7 thauera comamonas ignavibacterium ohtaekwangia and dokdonella were present in the system with relative abundances of 4 75 4 31 3 41 3 31 2 13 1 91 and 1 65 respectively thauera is as denitrifying bacteria 39 and ohtaekwangia is a heterotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria which can advance the pn 35 it can be seen that pn increased with the participation of autotrophic aob and heterotrophic aob and that denitrifying bacteria can survive in the system with very little available organic carbon under higher fa conditions the relative abundance of the nitrosomonas genus increased noticeably to 11 11 from 3 93 while the relative abundance of nitrospira decreased to 0 67 these figures indicate that raising the fa was an effective approach to optimizing the microbial groups for enhanced shortcut nitrification and that the effect of a consistently high fa concentration at higher than 15 88 2 14 mg l has clear benefits in terms of the microbial community over the entire operation cycle both ca kuenenia 0 56 and ca anammoxoglobusde 0 80 were identified as the predominant genera of anaob and indicate that the pn a autotrophic nitrogen removal system was started up successfully note that the heterotrophic ammonia oxidizing genus ohtaekwangia can be generated under high fa conditions with relative abundance from 0 92 to 2 73 by utilizing the internal carbon in the sludge due to the decay of microbes under the supernormal environmental pressure a sharp decline was observed in the case of thauera one of the heterotrophic bacteria more attention needs to be given to the trends for thauera during operation and more trials are needed to identify the influence of free ammonia on pd 24 after reducing do to a low concentration fig 6c of less than 0 08 mg l the relative abundance of ca kuenenia and ca anammoxoglobusde grew weakly from 0 56 to 0 80 and 0 80 to 1 18 respectively a similar tendency was noted for nitrosomonas however nitrospira showed the opposite trend a negative correlation was found between do and anaob indicating that the aeration process in this system requires further optimization as shown in fig 6 proteobacteria was dominant at the level of phylum in all stages at the genus level after 208 days of operation with no external carbon source the dominant aob bacteria genus and nob in the floccular sludge were nitrosomonas and nitrospira with relative abundances of 6 64 and 0 95 respectively ca kuenenia and ca anammoxoglobusde accounted for a relatively small proportion of the microbial biomass this is likely the reason why the single stage pn a process fell far short of the theoretical removal rate of tn these rates also indicate significant potential for improved efficiency sodium acetate was added to the pn a system as the organic carbon source and the cod concentration was set at about 50 mg l nitrosomonas showed a slight increase from 6 64 to 8 44 the relative abundance of nitrospira in the system decreased to 0 11 and the proportion of the genus ohtaekwangia increased from 1 73 to 2 04 the genus thauera the partial denitrification bacteria increased from 0 19 to 17 6 it has been speculated that thauera rapidly proliferates under low c n ratio conditions and competes with nob for nitrite thereby inhibiting the proliferation of nob 40 in this study the rapid proliferation of thauera can be attributed to the lower cod concentration in addition the reduction rate of nitrate by thauera is greater than that of nitrite resulting in the accumulation of nitrite and contributing to the success of the anammox process 41 this suggests that the contribution of pd was its role in the enhancement of tn removal efficiency after the sodium acetate was added when the cod in the influent was set at about 100 mg l the relative abundance of nitrosomonas and nitrospira was relatively stable the thauera decreased from 17 6 to 8 15 and the ohtaekwangia also decreased from 2 04 to 1 67 these results are further evidence that a cod of 100 mg l is excessive it was found that the heterotrophic litorilinea proliferated rapidly from 0 04 to 14 8 as has been reported in an earlier study lysobacter a a kind of heterotrophic bacteria played a stronger role in stage 3 than in other stages 42 in this pilot phase of the study the tn removal efficiency increased with the increasing concentration of cod but this was associated with a decrease of 53 9 in the relative abundance of thauera this can be mainly atttibuted to the lower nitrate to carbon ratio no3 n cod therefore it can be concluded that the the ratio between no3 n and cod is a key factor in the strengthening of pd 24 throughout the operation of the reactor the relative abundance of ca kuenenia gradually decreased as the organic matter concentration increased this is consistent with the findings of previous research 43 however the trend for ca anammoxoglobus was opposite it is possible that some species in ca anammoxoglobus had a growth advantage over other anaob in the presence of acetate in addition when the cod concentration in the system is low the affinity constant of anaob for no2 n is 6 times higher than that of denitrifying bacteria as has been found in an earlier study 44 we can conclude from the results in this study that denitrifying bacteria will not win in the competition with anaob more than that anaob pd bacteria nob and aob coexisted in a single reactor although there were flocculent sludge 4 discussion microbial community characterization revealed the do and fa levels adopted induced the failed washout of nob fig 6a d previous study showed that a long floc srt facilitated the enrichment of aob and anaob while it was unfavorable for washing out nob 3 similarly in this study the remaining fa concentration at about 10 40 1 38 mg l could not produce a sustained inhibition of nob even at a do of approx 0 15 mg l equally notable is that nre dropped markedly below 40 on 115 134 days fa is about 17 76 mg l and do of approx 0 25 mg l and 174 183 days fa is about 13 47 mg l and do of approx 0 10 mg l or so prior work has demonstrated that fa of up to 16 0 mg l did not have any inhibitory effect on aob culture and the do concentration was maintained within the range of 2 75 3 25 mg l 45 presently there are less research on the combined effects of do and fa even free nitrous acid fna on pn or anammox process in the late experiment period compared to single stage pn a process single stage pnda process achieved further improvements in an average total nitrogen removal efficiency of 85 29 a previous study of the pd a process in two sequencing batch reactors a maximum nre of 94 06 was achieved 36 in another study a pd process was started up successfully using carbon sources in domestic wastewater with sodium nitrate nano3 added 24 but there is absence of anammox process unlike the studies mentioned above in this study the nitrite and nitrite were produced in situ through the nitritation process and anammox process in the one stage pnda process the aob nob anaob and pd bacteria experience the same growth conditions the maximum overlap of the suitable growth environment for the aboved bacteria is crucial for the stability and reliability of nitrogen removal in real application moreover performance of the pand process treating low strength municipal wastewater under low temperatures need to be investigated further 5 conclusions in this study based on pn a and pd process a lab scale pnda process was developed in a single sbr reactor with an average nre of 85 29 the results from operating the reactor at different do concentrations indicate that it was possible to achieve pn by controlling do less than 0 5 mg l but in order to make the single stage pn a process more stable in long term operation maintaining the fa concentration at higher than 15 88 2 14 mg l is an efficient way to inhibit the activity of nob than low do condition microbial community characterization revealed that anaob pd bacteria nob and aob coexisted in flocculent sludge the remarkable enrichment of thauera with a relative abundance of 17 6 and ca anammoxoglobus which became the dominant in the microbial community in the anammox biomass were attributed to the effect of the addition of sodium acetate this single stage pnad process can potentially be applied to further

13171,a novel process named single stage pnda that integrates the partial nitritation partial denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation in a single lab scale sequencing batch reactor was developed to treat moderate strength ammonia wastewater 220 mg n l firstly a single stage partial nitritation anammox process was started up with the total nitrogen removal efficiencies of approx 76 22 and the remaining free ammonia concentration could produce a more sustained inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob than low do condition then the proposed one stage pnda process achieved an average total nitrogen removal efficiency of 85 29 by adding sodium acetate in the influent at a concentration of 50 mg cod l microbial community characterization revealed that ammonia oxidizing bacteria anammox bacteria nob and partial denitrification bacteria coexist in the suspended sludge the significant enrichment of thauera and the dominance of ca anammoxoglobus in the anammox biomass indicate their important role in the improved nitrogen removal performance this single stage pnad process can potentially be applied to further improve the total nitrogen removal efficiency of pn a process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords suspended sludge partial nitritation anammox nob inhibition partial denitrificaiton microbial community 1 introduction anammox anaerobic ammonia oxidation has become a hot research topic as a highly efficient and cost saving process to remove nitrogen from wastewater in recent years in the anammox biomass nitrite is reduced to nitrogen gas and ammonia plays the role of electron donor eq 1 1 2 for the annamox reaction to proceed no2 n needs to be generated in a pretreatment step in sewage treatment for this purpose partial nitritation pn is a widely accepted technology 2 4 as an alternative to the conventional biological nitrogen removal method via nitrification denitrification the paritial nitritation coupled with anammox process pn a has been reported to consume 60 less oxygen requires no organic carbon source and produces about 90 less sludge 5 6 1 nh4 n 1 32 no2 n 0 066 hco3 0 13h 1 02 n2 0 26 no3 n 0 066 ch2o0 5n0 15 2 03 h2o due to the above advantages the single stage pn a process is becoming more widely available in the treatment of moderate or high ammonia nitrogen 100 500 mg l wastewater 7 8 the challenge to the acceptance of this process is the high rate of failure during the startup or operation period it is mainly because of the large amount of nitrate produced by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and a low n removal efficiency resulting in high total nitrogen in the effluent 9 11 in recent years it has been reported that nob inhibition can be achieved economically and efficiently by controlling the concentration of dissolved oxygen do and free ammonia fa 12 15 it has also ben reported that the discharging aged flocs or adding chemical inhibitors is also useful to reduce the total nitrogen in the reactor and effluent 3 16 however control of the overall process remains challenging because the nob coexists with ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and other microorganisms 17 in this study a low do and suitable fa were chosen for start up with the aim of stabilizing the pn a process economically and efficiently without the addition of any chemical inhibitors preventing the establishment of nitrate in the pn a system is challenging because of the by products of the anammox reaction besides that completely eliminating nob is considered impossible growing studies have focused on methods to improve the total nitrogen removal via denitrifiers it has been reported that there is a toxic effect of organic substances on anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob as well as promotes the generation of heterotrophic bacteria which competes with anaob resulting in low efficiency of autotrophic nitrogen removal 11 18 in other studies it has been reported that organic matter at a certain concentration does not inhibit anaob activity and can even be used by anaob through a number of different metabolic pathways 19 20 for example the use of acetic acid as an electron acceptor by ca brocadia fulgida and the oxidation of glucose acetic acid and propionic acid by ca brocadia anammoxidans ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis 21 22 in addition the use of carbon sources to achieve partial denitrification pd can reduce no3 n while also simultaneously supplying no2 n for the anammox reaction 23 24 however there are less research on the combined process of pn pd and anammox in a single reactor pnda the relationship between the operation conditions and sludge population structure remains unknown the objectives of this study was to evaluate the effect of do and fa in stabilizing the pn a reactor performance and starting up a single stage pnda process the effects of the operation conditions on the growth of aob nob denitrifier and anaob were also evaluated the results are expected to suggest approaches for improving the nitrogen removal performance of the single stage autotrophic process 2 materials and methods 2 1 sequencing batch reactor sbr and operation a lab scale sbr with an

then a small quantity of anammox biomass 500 ml was added to the system for the start up of the single stage pn a in the second phase the sbr was operated three cycles per day for the duration of the experimental period each cycle consisted of 180 min of operation which included 15 min feeding 305 min aerobic treatment 85 min stirring 60 min settling and 15 min decanting 5 l of synthetic

prjna766448 3 results 3 1 start up and performance of single stage pn a system 3 1 1 start up of the pn process during the starting procedure of partial nitritation most of the supernatant about 75 in the reactor was discharged at the end of the cycle to reduce the no2 n concentration at the beginning of next period and to reduce the nob proliferation that is from the stirring step to the decanting the reduction in ammonia and nitrite and the increase in nitrate were used to evaluate the system performance as shown in fig 2 during phase 1 1 17 d the inoculated sludge gradually adapted to the system environment and the full nitrification process improved almost all of the ammonia was oxidized to nitrate at the do concentration of 1 0 0 5 mg l pn was achieved with a reduction in the do concentration 0 4 0 1 mg l in phase 2 18 34 d the gradual increase in nar to 73 02 after day 34 suggests that nob was inhibited at this do level this finding is in agreement with the oxygen half saturation constant of aob of 0 20 0 40 mg l 28 in order to enhance the pn process the do concentration was further reduced to 0 25 0 05 mg l in phase 3 35 42 d and then to 0 14 0 06 mg l in phase 4 43 52 d at first a clear reduction in the ammonia consumption and nitrate production was found similar to the response in phase 2 a decrease in nitrite production also occurred at this do level indicating the suppression of aob activity as was also reported by previous study 29 but with the above mentioned suppression reversed in next phase as shown in fig 3 so it was not irreversible in this study afterwards the nar reached a maximum of 83 18 in phase 4 with an average of 80 12 1 51 and a nitrite concentration of approx 28 4 mg l nar showed a trend to gradually increase from 20 to 80 approximately when the do decreased from 1 0 mg l to 0 14 mg l in the reactor fig 2 which demonstrated a inverse correlation between pn and do in this phase 3 1 2 the effect of do and fa concentration on the pn a process at the beginning of stage 2 a portion of the anammox activated sludge 500 ml was added to the reactor to form a single stage pn a system to avoid a negative impact on the seed sludge of anaob in the system the do concentration was controlled at about 0 15 0 20 mg l at the initial phase 53 63 d of operation the no2 n concentration in the effluent went into a steep decline from 42 88 mg l to 5 04 mg l fig 3a and the nh4 n concentration in the effluent increased at first and then decreased fig 3b in the meantime a weak reduction in no3 n was also found fig 3c these phenomena were caused by the death of microbial cell of seeding sludge and the adaptation stage of anammox activated sludge the next phase the no3 n value in effluent increased rapidly along with a marked decrease in nh4 n and no2 n in the post anoxic period these results showed a gradual adaptation of inoculated anaob to the system 30 with the start up of pn a after 50 days in operation an rise in the aor was found meanwhile nlr was increased the nlr increased to about 0 3 kg n m3 d and the aor increased from 0 049 kg n m3 d 64 d to 0 179 kg n m3 d 112 d in the case of nor a massive increase was observed 13 6 times and this appeared to continue to rise fig 4 this was an indication that while nob activity in the one stage pn a can be limited by low do but it cannot be fully suppressed 13 more than that these outcomes indicated that the remaining free ammonia fa concentration at approx 10 40 1 38 mg l in the influent could not produce sustained inhibition of nob even at a do of approx 0 15 mg l further the deterioration in nitrogen performance was caused by high nob activity fig 4 the fa condition was investigated to determine its effect on pn according to previous studies a higher fa improves the performance of pn 12 14 31 as shown in fig 5 the slight increase in the influent ammonia nitrogen concentration to about 250 mg l resulted in a higher fa condition of approx 17 76 mg l subsequently during the operation from days 112 to 133 the average value of fa in the effluent was maintained at 14 86 3 37 mg l during this period after an initial decrease in the aor the aor recovered and no further increase in the nor occurred that is the worsening trend of pn was successfully restrained the consistently low effluent no2 n 0 67 mg l suggests that the fa did not significantly inhibit anaob in this study this result is different from that of an earlier study which found that fa not only suppressed nob but also had an effect anaob 32 in this study early in stage 2 the nre dropped below 40 as indicated in fig 3c it is likely that the main cause for nre reduction was the weakness of the aob or and microbial cell decay during anammox sludge adaptation period which has been reported to lead to a lower concentration of no2 n in effluent and therefore a deteriorated nitrogen removal performance 33 the fa concentration was reduced to its initial level by adjusting the influent nh4 n concentration at 134 d fig 5 subsequently during the operation of the system from days 134 155 d the nre increased to 70 fig 3c a gradual increase in the aor was also observed and the nor remained stable indicating that at a low do concentration level maintaining the concentration of fa above 14 87 3 37 mg l has a strong inhibitory effect on nob and also that the inhibition of aob was reversible fig 4 to determine the effect of the do concentration on the system the aeration was reduced from 0 45 nl min to 0 35 nl min and the do in the reactor was reduced to 0 10 mg l 156 d as shown in fig 3 4 aor nor and effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were intitally relatively stable also the nre was maintained at about 70 at first but with the operation of the reactor the effluent nh4 n concentration began to increase 170 d and a reduction in the aor and nre to 0 095 kg n m3 d and 40 was observed while nor remained stable this is consistent with earlier findings that the oxygen half saturation constant ko2 of aob is 0 07 mg l and that aob could not produce sufficient nitrite for anaob when do concentrations were below the above value 13 34 considering this the long term hypoxia conditioning do 0 08 mg l is not recommended in the implementation of pn a and neither is it suitable for implementing pn governance in the sbr a stable performance of the system was achieved when the aeration rate and do concentration were restored to their original level 184 d this was after a rapid rise in the aor even slightly higher than that before the decrease in the do concentration the nor remained stable but showed a slight downward trend as shown in fig 3c the system effluent no3 n was higher than 34 14 mg l and remained at a high level as the investigation continues 184 209 d the effluent no2 n concentration remained stable 1 01 mg l and the total nitrogen removal efficiency increased to 71 02 during this period 104 209 d the effluent no3 n remained consistently at a higher level approximately 39 12 mg l it infered that there was still a portion of nob in the system which was likely the main reason for the lower nre than theoretical value 89 therefore if pd could be combined with this pn a process to convert nitrate to nitrite the nitrogen removal capacity would be improved 3 2 start up of the single stage pnda process to combine partial denitrifiction with pn a to start up a single stage pnda process at 210 days sodium acetate was added in infflent with a cod of 50 mg l codinf nh4 ninf about 0 22 while no significant change in the nitrogen removal performance in this system was observed in the initial stages at 215 d the effluent concentration of no3 n had decreased markedly after 221 d the concentration of nh4 n began to decrease significantly and the concentration of no2 n began to increase indicating a proliferation of denitrifying bacteria in the system and a gradual increase in the tn removal efficiency it is also possible that partial denitrification no3 n to no2 n pd was realized 24 or the process of partial nitrification was enhanced by the presence of heterotrophic aob such as the ohtaekwangia genus in the system 35 according to a comprehensive analysis of stoichiometry during feeding phase and early aeration phase no3 n decreased gradually with the no2 n accumulated it is almost certain that pd process has been started up in the pn a system at 225 d however the concentration of no3 n increased from 16 95 mg l to 21 18 mg l fig 3c this rise in no3 n can likely be attributed to the complete consumption of the nh4 n in the system at the end of the aeration phase resulting in a lack of the electron donors necessary for the anammox process this is despite a no2 n concentration of 8 4 mg l in the effluent this excess nitrogen was likely used in the matrix of the nob on the whole a single stage pnda process has been achieved accumulated no3 n from pn a process was further removed via the combination of anammox and pd processes so that the nitrogen removal performance was enhanced accordingly try to keep the above issues in perspective more organic carbon might be able to reduce the concentration of no3 n effectively 24 36 at 263 d the cod in the influent was further increased to 100 mg l c n 0 43 as shown in fig 3a the nh4 n and no2 n concentrations in the effluent remained stable and the nitrate concentration decreased to below 5 0 mg l in the case of nre a significant upward trend was observed with a peak reached at about 95 10 283 d and then a gradual decrease over time from these results it can be concluded that increasing the cod in the influent to 100 mg l can have short term benefits but that these benefits are unsustainable in the long run 3 3 microbial structure characteristics high throughput sequencing was carried out to determine the microbial structure of the community the results indicate that 26 phylums were detected in the system after partial nitrification 52 d proteobacteria which was shown to be the dominant phylum include several genus related to nitrogen removal at the genus level the unclassified genus was as high as 53 51 nitrosomonas was found at an relative abundance of 3 93 and nitrospira was 0 4 these genus are known be involved in the pn a initiation phase 37 38 this is the most obvious sign of the success in obtaining partial nitrification by enriching aob and eliminating nob effectively however the many other genus indicate the complexity of the system fig 6a in addition armatimonadetes gp7 thauera comamonas ignavibacterium ohtaekwangia and dokdonella were present in the system with relative abundances of 4 75 4 31 3 41 3 31 2 13 1 91 and 1 65 respectively thauera is as denitrifying bacteria 39 and ohtaekwangia is a heterotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria which can advance the pn 35 it can be seen that pn increased with the participation of autotrophic aob and heterotrophic aob and that denitrifying bacteria can survive in the system with very little available organic carbon under higher fa conditions the relative abundance of the nitrosomonas genus increased noticeably to 11 11 from 3 93 while the relative abundance of nitrospira decreased to 0 67 these figures indicate that raising the fa was an effective approach to optimizing the microbial groups for enhanced shortcut nitrification and that the effect of a consistently high fa concentration at higher than 15 88 2 14 mg l has clear benefits in terms of the microbial community over the entire operation cycle both ca kuenenia 0 56 and ca anammoxoglobusde 0 80 were identified as the predominant genera of anaob and indicate that the pn a autotrophic nitrogen removal system was started up successfully note that the heterotrophic ammonia oxidizing genus ohtaekwangia can be generated under high fa conditions with relative abundance from 0 92 to 2 73 by utilizing the internal carbon in the sludge due to the decay of microbes under the supernormal environmental pressure a sharp decline was observed in the case of thauera one of the heterotrophic bacteria more attention needs to be given to the trends for thauera during operation and more trials are needed to identify the influence of free ammonia on pd 24 after reducing do to a low concentration fig 6c of less than 0 08 mg l the relative abundance of ca kuenenia and ca anammoxoglobusde grew weakly from 0 56 to 0 80 and 0 80 to 1 18 respectively a similar tendency was noted for nitrosomonas however nitrospira showed the opposite trend a negative correlation was found between do and anaob indicating that the aeration process in this system requires further optimization as shown in fig 6 proteobacteria was dominant at the level of phylum in all stages at the genus level after 208 days of operation with no external carbon source the dominant aob bacteria genus and nob in the floccular sludge were nitrosomonas and nitrospira with relative abundances of 6 64 and 0 95 respectively ca kuenenia and ca anammoxoglobusde accounted for a relatively small proportion of the microbial biomass this is likely the reason why the single stage pn a process fell far short of the theoretical removal rate of tn these rates also indicate significant potential for improved efficiency sodium acetate was added to the pn a system as the organic carbon source and the cod concentration was set at about 50 mg l nitrosomonas showed a slight increase from 6 64 to 8 44 the relative abundance of nitrospira in the system decreased to 0 11 and the proportion of the genus ohtaekwangia increased from 1 73 to 2 04 the genus thauera the partial denitrification bacteria increased from 0 19 to 17 6 it has been speculated that thauera rapidly proliferates under low c n ratio conditions and competes with nob for nitrite thereby inhibiting the proliferation of nob 40 in this study the rapid proliferation of thauera can be attributed to the lower cod concentration in addition the reduction rate of nitrate by thauera is greater than that of nitrite resulting in the accumulation of nitrite and contributing to the success of the anammox process 41 this suggests that the contribution of pd was its role in the enhancement of tn removal efficiency after the sodium acetate was added when the cod in the influent was set at about 100 mg l the relative abundance of nitrosomonas and nitrospira was relatively stable the thauera decreased from 17 6 to 8 15 and the ohtaekwangia also decreased from 2 04 to 1 67 these results are further evidence that a cod of 100 mg l is excessive it was found that the heterotrophic litorilinea proliferated rapidly from 0 04 to 14 8 as has been reported in an earlier study lysobacter a a kind of heterotrophic bacteria played a stronger role in stage 3 than in other stages 42 in this pilot phase of the study the tn removal efficiency increased with the increasing concentration of cod but this was associated with a decrease of 53 9 in the relative abundance of thauera this can be mainly atttibuted to the lower nitrate to carbon ratio no3 n cod therefore it can be concluded that the the ratio between no3 n and cod is a key factor in the strengthening of pd 24 throughout the operation of the reactor the relative abundance of ca kuenenia gradually decreased as the organic matter concentration increased this is consistent with the findings of previous research 43 however the trend for ca anammoxoglobus was opposite it is possible that some species in ca anammoxoglobus had a growth advantage over other anaob in the presence of acetate in addition when the cod concentration in the system is low the affinity constant of anaob for no2 n is 6 times higher than that of denitrifying bacteria as has been found in an earlier study 44 we can conclude from the results in this study that denitrifying bacteria will not win in the competition with anaob more than that anaob pd bacteria nob and aob coexisted in a single reactor although there were flocculent sludge 4 discussion microbial community characterization revealed the do and fa levels adopted induced the failed washout of nob fig 6a d previous study showed that a long floc srt facilitated the enrichment of aob and anaob while it was unfavorable for washing out nob 3 similarly in this study the remaining fa concentration at about 10 40 1 38 mg l could not produce a sustained inhibition of nob even at a do of approx 0 15 mg l equally notable is that nre dropped markedly below 40 on 115 134 days fa is about 17 76 mg l and do of approx 0 25 mg l and 174 183 days fa is about 13 47 mg l and do of approx 0 10 mg l or so prior work has demonstrated that fa of up to 16 0 mg l did not have any inhibitory effect on aob culture and the do concentration was maintained within the range of 2 75 3 25 mg l 45 presently there are less research on the combined effects of do and fa even free nitrous acid fna on pn or anammox process in the late experiment period compared to single stage pn a process single stage pnda process achieved further improvements in an average total nitrogen removal efficiency of 85 29 a previous study of the pd a process in two sequencing batch reactors a maximum nre of 94 06 was achieved 36 in another study a pd process was started up successfully using carbon sources in domestic wastewater with sodium nitrate nano3 added 24 but there is absence of anammox process unlike the studies mentioned above in this study the nitrite and nitrite were produced in situ through the nitritation process and anammox process in the one stage pnda process the aob nob anaob and pd bacteria experience the same growth conditions the maximum overlap of the suitable growth environment for the aboved bacteria is crucial for the stability and reliability of nitrogen removal in real application moreover performance of the pand process treating low strength municipal wastewater under low temperatures need to be investigated further 5 conclusions in this study based on pn a and pd process a lab scale pnda process was developed in a single sbr reactor with an average nre of 85 29 the results from operating the reactor at different do concentrations indicate that it was possible to achieve pn by controlling do less than 0 5 mg l but in order to make the single stage pn a process more stable in long term operation maintaining the fa concentration at higher than 15 88 2 14 mg l is an efficient way to inhibit the activity of nob than low do condition microbial community characterization revealed that anaob pd bacteria nob and aob coexisted in flocculent sludge the remarkable enrichment of thauera with a relative abundance of 17 6 and ca anammoxoglobus which became the dominant in the microbial community in the anammox biomass were attributed to the effect of the addition of sodium acetate this single stage pnad process can potentially be applied to further

13172,in this study the impact of organic fouling layers on the transport of micropollutants mps during the operation of the forward osmosis fo process was investigated the rejection of mps after the formation of organic fouling layers with three model foulants bovine serum albumin bsa sodium alginate sa and humic acids ha showed that the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions governed the transport of mps the negatively charged functional groups in the organic fouling layers increased the rejection of negatively charged mps while the rejection of positively charged and neutral mps with high kow was significantly decreased in the presence of an organic fouling layer the adsorption analysis showed that the positively charged and hydrophobic mps were preferably adsorbed into the organic fouling layers and the elevated concentration of mps in the organic foulant layer accelerated the diffusional transport of adsorbed mps across the fo membranes the sa showed higher adsorption capacities of mps than ha or bsa and thus a dramatic decrease in the rejection of mps was observed our findings indicate that the rejection efficiencies of mps might be overestimated when experiments are conducted without organic fouling layers the rejection of mps thus should be carried out in the presence of foulants in the fo process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords micropollutants forward osmosis organic fouling layer transport solute properties 1 introduction the production of clean water from unconventional sources such as wastewater effluent and seawater has been recognized as an alternative method to overcome the water scarcity problem 1 2 the reverse osmosis ro membrane process has been widely adopted for the production of potable or reused water because of its high water recovery and salt rejection 3 however the high consumption of electricity during the operation of the ro process has been regarded as one of the biggest issues to be solved this problem has led to the development of alternative or hybrid processes such as nanofiltration pressure retarded osmosis pro retrofit of energy recovery devices and forward osmosis fo processes 4 5 among alternative technologies the fo ro hybrid process was proposed to produce high quality water from wastewater effluent and seawater with lower energy consumption 6 in this process wastewater effluent is first treated by fo utilizing seawater as a draw solution the diluted seawater is then desalted by a subsequent ro process at a significantly lower operating pressure than that of undiluted seawater 7 the fo ro hybrid process can reduce the consumption of electrical energy while also offering a multi barrier effect against emerging contaminants recent study reported that the permeate water from the pilot scale fo ro process showed superior water quality than a stand alone ro process that satisfied the water quality criteria for indirect potable reuse 8 however the concerns on the adverse effects of micropollutants mps to the human health and the aquatic environment have been highlighted although the trace level μg l to ng l of mps is monitored in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants 9 thus the presence and transport of mps may be a potential threat to the potable water supply because the fo ro hybrid process utilizes secondary or tertiary effluent as a feed solution several studies have highlighted that the rejection of mps in fo is mainly governed by characteristics of the membrane surface 10 11 solute properties 12 and solution chemistry 13 in addition the occurrence of membrane fouling during the operation in the fo process also acknowledged as a significant factor on the rejection of mps d haese et al 14 reported that the rejection of sulfamethoxazole was significantly decreased when the fo membrane was fouled by sodium alginate on the contrary increased rejection of sulfamethoxazole was reported when the fo membrane was fouled with humic acid 10 15 the rejection of carbamazepine also significantly varied in the presence of organic fouling layers as well as the type of organic foulants 16 this implies that the transport of mps through organic fouled fo membranes might also be affected by the properties of organic fouling layers in addition to the properties of fo membranes the rejection of neutral trace organic compounds in the fo process was decreased after the formation of the organic fouling layer due to enhanced cake enhanced concentration polarization and decreased electrostatic repulsion 17 18 in addition li et al 19 investigated the impact of electrostatic interactions between negatively charged organic foulants and negatively charged mps and concluded that the increased rejection of negatively charged mps was mainly due to electrostatic repulsion although the previous studies have tried to correlate the changes in the surface characteristics of fo membrane e g hydrophobicity and surface charge to the change of mps rejection when the membrane is fouled with organic matters the changes in mps transport by other mechanisms including concentration polarization adsorption and size exclusion of mps in the presence and absence of organic fouling layers has been hardly considered the aim of this study is to elucidate the impact of organic fouling layers on the rejection of mps by fo membranes to investigate the interactions between organic foulants and mps the fo membranes were fouled with three organic macromolecules sodium alginate sa bovine serum albumin bsa and humic acid ha and the rejection of mps was monitored in addition to the electrostatic interactions the hydrophobicity and molecular size of mps were considered to explain the transport mechanism of mps through organic fouling layers 2

top of a polysulfone porous substrate before use the membrane coupons were soaked in deionized water and stored at 4 c a laboratory scale fo system consists of a cross flow membrane cell with an effective membrane area of 20 15 cm2 12 during the tests the flow rates of the feed and draw solutions were kept constant at 421 ml min corresponding to a cross flow velocity of 9 cm s using a gear

to calculate the reversal salt flux the conductivity of the feed solution was monitored using a conductivity probe vernier software technology usa 2 3 operation of fo the rejection of mps was investigated in three steps first the fo system was stabilized with deionized water and 0 5 m nacl solution as feed and draw solutions respectively the organic fouling layer was then allowed to develop using a feed solution containing 100 mg l of each model organic foulant in the background solution containing 10 mm nacl 1 mm nahco3 and 1 mm cacl2 all fouling experiments were performed at a ph of 7 0 0 2 and a temperature of 21 0 5 c for 12 h after the development of each organic fouling layer the feed solution was replaced with an identical solution containing 100 μg l of each mp the experiments were terminated after 3 h of operation and samples were taken from both feed and draw solutions before and after the experiments to measure the transport of mps the rejection of mps was calculated from eq 1 1 r 1 df c ds f c fs i 100 where cds f is the final mp concentration in the draw solution cfs i is the initial mp concentration in the feed solution and df is the dilution factor df defined by the ratio of the final volume of the draw solution and the initial volume of the feed solution 2 4 adsorption of mps to model organic foulants to measure the adsorption capacities of mps by three organic foulants we adopted the method proposed by chen and elimelech 21 first 0 1 g l of bare silica particles 500 nm sigma aldrich usa was coated with 0 1 poly l lysine pll sigma aldrich usa after the centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was replaced with 100 mg doc l of each organic foulant solution e g sa ha and bsa and vortexed finally the samples were centrifuged and rinsed with deionized water the mass of coated organic matter was calculated by the changes in the doc of the supernatant table s1 the adsorption capacity of mps to each type of organic matter organic matter was then conducted in 250 ml of a solution containing 10 mm nacl 1 mm nahco3 0 1 g l of organic coated silica particles and 1 mg l of each mp after 12 h at room temperature the organic coated silica particles were removed by membrane filtration 0 2 μm syringe filter whatman and the concentration of mps in the filtrate was analyzed 2 5 analysis of mps the concentration of mps in the samples was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms lcms 2020 shimadzu japan the solid phase extraction was applied as pretreatment for the draw solution samples to concentrate and purify mps more detailed protocols can be found in our previous study 12 2 6 characterization of membranes the contact angles of deionized water were measured by a contact angle meter surface electro optics korea at five locations the surface potential of the membranes was measured by an electrokinetic analyzer surpass 3 anton paar austria with a 10 mm nacl solution at ph 7 all measurements were performed at room temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in membrane surface properties by organic matters table 2 presents the change of the fo membrane surface properties before and after the formation of each organic fouling layer once the membrane was fouled by ha and sa the surface charge of the membrane became more negative and hydrophilic compared to the virgin membrane due to the abundance of carboxylic functional groups in organic molecules 22 in the case of bsa fouling both the surface potential and the contact angle increased due to the abundance of amide groups and aromatic rings in the polypeptide structure of the protein 23 the water flux and specific reversal salt flux srsf with the organically fouled fo membrane are presented in fig 1 the water flux and srsf increased from 20 6 to 22 6 lmh and 0 063 to 0 113 l mmol respectively after the formation of the ha layer on the fo membranes when the ha molecules were deposited on the fo membrane surface the membrane surface turned more hydrophilic and negative due to the negatively charged functional groups e g carboxylic group of ha the hydrophilic modification led the increase in the water flux while the negatively charged ha layer decreased the reverse salt flux due to enhanced electrostatic repulsion with ions as shown in our previous study 24 the formation of the sa fouling layer on the membrane surface resulted in a noticeable flux decline from 20 6 to 14 9 lmh this is mainly due to sa molecules forming strong cross linking between calcium ions and carboxyl groups on the fo membrane surface it should be noted that linear structured sas are turned to a strongly bound egg box structure in the presence of ca2 24 thus the strong foulant foulant adhesion resulted in faster accumulation of sa and more severe membrane fouling in the fo process 25 in contrast the water flux and srsf were not drastically affected by the bsa fouling layer the bsa acidity was stabilized at 1 1 5 meq g whereas the stabilized acidities of sa and ha were at 3 5 meq g and 3 3 meq g respectively 26 27 therefore the presence of cations ca2 in the feed solution would not significantly affect bsa fouling due to the low content of carboxylic groups in bsa compared to those of sa and ha 3 2 impact of organic fouling layers on the rejection of mps 3 2 1 effect of molecular weight the rejection of mps by the fo membrane is mainly governed by their physicochemical properties such as molecular weight charge and hydrophobicity 11 fig 2 presents the changes in the rejection of mps in virgin and organic fouled fo membranes according to their molecular weights our previous study showed that the rejection efficiency of neutral mps in the fo process was mainly governed by a size exclusion mechanism 12 however in the current experiment the rejection of higher mw compounds shows a different rejection tendency depending on the type of organic fouling layers in the case of the bsa and ha fouled membrane the rejection efficiencies of low molecular weight mps 200 g mol increased after the formation of organic fouling layers but that of high mw compounds 200 g mol was not changed or even decreased in the sa fouled membrane we concluded that in addition to the impact of mw on the rejection of mps solute properties in the presence of organic fouling layers on the fo membrane surface should also be considered importantly and thus it was necessary to consider other physicochemical factors such as the changes in hydrophobicity charge and adsorption during the formation of organic fouling layer 3 2 2 effect of solute charge and hydrophobicity 3 2 2 1 neutral compounds fig 3 presents the change in rejection efficiency of the virgin and organic fouled fo membranes for neutral mps act and cff with low molecular weight mw exhibited significantly lower rejection efficiencies by the virgin membranes than those of higher molecular weight compounds such as cbz lnr and tcs due to the steric interaction according to the molecular weight cut off mwco of the fo membrane 200 da 12 however the rejection of neutral mps changed dramatically after the formation of organic fouling layers on the fo membranes the rejection of act and cff which had lower log kow increased after the formation of the organic fouling layer while the rejection of mps with higher kow decreased significantly it has been reported that the rejection of mps is generally increased by enhanced steric hindrance of the organic fouling layer 17 however the rejection efficiencies of mps with a relatively high log kow 2 with the rejection efficiencies of the cbz lnr and tcs were decreased and it became more pronounced with an increase of kow the kow is the ratio of a chemical s concentration in the octanol phase to its concentration in the aqueous phase of a two phase system at equilibrium and describes a chemical s lipophilic or hydrophobic properties thus the hydrophobic interaction between mps and organic fouling layers played important roles during the transport of mps through fo membranes similar findings have been reported in the nanofiltration nf ro membrane processes 28 29 that the hydrophobic adsorption of mps into organic fouling layer induced an increased diffusion of mps to permeate stream experiments to verify potential mechanisms are further discussed in section 3 3 3 2 2 2 charged compounds the charge of mps is one of the major factors determining the transport through organic fouled fo membranes as illustrated in fig 4 all of the negatively charged mps showed high rejection efficiencies above 95 in both virgin and organic fouled fo membranes due to the negatively charged virgin membrane surfaces and organic fouling layers these results were consistent with previous findings that negatively charged mps showed higher rejection efficiency than neutral mps in fouled fo membranes 15 16 in contrast the rejection of positively charged mps was significantly changed in the presence of organic fouling layers for the positively charged solutes the virgin membrane surfaces which have negatively charged surfaces promote the adsorption of mps and increases the concentration of mps in the polymeric structure of fo membrane which results in the increased mass transfer to the permeate stream and thus the decrease in the rejection of positively charged mps 28 as shown in fig 4 b the overall rejection efficiency of positively charged mps in the bsa fouled membrane was slightly higher than that of the virgin membrane the rejection of att and tmp in the sa fouled fo membrane decreased to 72 9 and 77 7 compared to the rejection in the virgin membrane 92 4 and 90 3 respectively in particular the rejection efficiency of att which had a high log kow value dramatically decreased in the sa fouled membrane the changes in the rejection of hydrophobic mps in nf and ro membranes were investigated by several researchers 29 31 according to jang et al 12 the adsorption of mps into the fo membrane polymer structure resulted in an elevated concentration gradient of mps across the fo membrane and thus facilitated the transport of mps to the permeate stream it also explained why the overall rejection efficiency of positively charged mps in the bsa fouled membrane was slightly higher than that of the virgin membrane as shown in fig 4 b that smallest mass of mps was adsorbed into the less negatively charged bsa layer thus the less amount of mps was diffused into the permeate stream the adsorption of mps into the fouling layer is further discussed in the following section 3 3 role of organic fouling layer during the rejection of mps 3 3 1 adsorption capacities of mps as discussed in the previous section the rejection of mps was significantly changed once organic fouling layers were formed on the fo membrane surfaces we hypothesized that hydrophobic mps are preferentially adsorbed into the fouling layer of organic matter and the locally elevated concentrations of highly adsorbed mps will facilitate transport to the permeated side to investigate the adsorption of mps to organic foulants organic foulant coated silica particles were mixed with mps and the adsorption capacities of mps were evaluated fig 5 shows the adsorption capacities of mps to the ha bsa and sa coated silica particles as expected neutral and positively charged mps showed significantly higher adsorption capacities than negatively charged mps as presented in fig 5 the adsorption capacity of mps was increased with an increase of kow due to the hydrophobic interactions with the hydrophobic structural parts of organic foulants moreover the electrical charge of mps also played a critical role in the adsorption capacity of mps interestingly sa showed higher adsorption capacities of mps compared to ha or bsa and the adsorption capacity of tcs with sa molecules was 1 5 μg mg which was the highest value among the selected mps this could be due to the strong adhesion between hydrophobic mps and sa molecules arising from the unique characteristics of the sa intermolecular structure when the sa molecules are combined with divalent ions e g calcium the sa layer is composed of cross linked long chain molecules which is called an egg box structure 32 this unique structure of sa molecules offers additional adsorption sites for contaminants 33 the adsorption capacities of negatively charged mps onto the organic matter were relatively lower than those of neutral and positively charged compounds regardless of their hydrophobicity this is because the organic matter in this study was also negatively charged supplementary data table s2 and thus electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged mps and organic matter prevented their adsorption on the organic matter the above results provide important insights into the interaction between mps and macromolecules as shown in figs 2 and 3 the rejection efficiency was decreased depending on the mps charge and kow and the rejection efficiencies of mps dramatically decreased in the sa fouled fo membrane from the adsorption test between solute and organic foulants the sa molecules showed the highest mps adsorption capacities the increased mass of adsorbed mps in the sa fouling layer induced locally higher mp concentrations and thus facilitated the diffusional transport of mps across the active layer of the membranes 34 however the ha and bsa fouling layer had relatively lower adsorption affinity with mps than the sa layer therefore we can conclude that the differences in the adsorption capacity with mps and the organic fouling layer structure might result in different transport behavior in the fo process 3 3 2 influence of solute foulant interactions on mps rejection to reveal the impact of elevated concentrations of mps on the rejection efficiencies of organically fouled fo membranes the amount of adsorbed mps versus the changes in rejection efficiencies of mps before and after formation of organic fouling layers are plotted in fig 6 it shows that the changes in rejection efficiencies during the formation of organic fouling layer becomes more significant with an increasing adsorption capacity of organic foulants with a pearson correlation coefficient r of 0 7064 therefore during the rejection of mps by fo membranes the impact of the organic fouling layer should be considered carefully otherwise the rejection will be either underestimated or overestimated depending on the solute foulant interaction during the formation of organic fouling layer mainly due to the adsorption or charge interaction between mps and organic fouling layers notably the difference in rejection between virgin and organic fouled membranes becomes more pronounced when positively charged and neutral mps with a high kow are involved 3 3 3 mp rejection after physical cleaning physical cleaning was conducted by increasing the cross flow velocity from 9 cm s to 15 cm s to investigate the change of mp rejection efficiency after removing the organic fouling layer because of the fouling reversibility due to a lack of applied hydraulic pressure 35 97 8 of the initial water flux was recovered after physical cleaning fig s1 fig 7 presents a comparison of the rejection efficiency of tcs and att before and after the physical cleaning which dramatically changed the rejection efficiencies after the formation of the sa fouling layer in figs 3 and 4 as discussed in section 3 3 1 the rejection of tcs and att decreased after the formation of sa fouling layers due to the favorable adsorption of tcs and att onto sa however the rejection efficiencies were fully recovered after physical cleaning this result confirms that the decrease in rejection of hydrophobic compounds by sa fouling mainly originates from locally increased concentration polarization by adsorption of mps in the membrane fouling layer 4 conclusion this study investigated the effects of organic fouling layers on the rejection of mps that were relevant to wastewater reuse by the fo process the changes in mp rejection efficiency were influenced by solute foulant interactions between organic fouling layers and mps the negatively charged mps were most effectively rejected due to the presence of repulsive electrostatic interactions with virgin or organically fouled membranes however the rejection of neutral or positively charged mps with high kow significantly decreased after the formation of the organic fouling layers this was due to the adsorption of mps into the organic fouling layers induced by hydrophobic or counter charge interactions the elevated concentration of mps in the organic fouling layers facilitates their diffusion to the permeate stream and thus the rejection efficiency decreased dramatically in the organically fouled fo membrane the results of this study suggest that the formation of an organic fouling layer on the fo membrane surface could significantly alter the rejection of mps that the removal of positively charged and neutral mps with high kow could be overestimated when the rejection tests are carried out in the absence of organic fouling layers thus the rejection of mps should be carefully monitored during the operation of fo membrane processes declaration of competing interest

membrane surface the membrane surface turned more hydrophilic and negative due to the negatively charged functional groups e g carboxylic group of ha the hydrophilic modification led the increase in the water flux while the negatively charged ha layer decreased the reverse salt flux due to enhanced electrostatic repulsion with ions as shown in our previous study 24 the formation of the sa fouling layer on the membrane surface resulted in a noticeable flux decline from 20 6 to 14 9 lmh this is mainly due to sa molecules forming strong cross linking between calcium ions and carboxyl groups on the fo membrane surface it should be noted that linear structured sas are turned to a strongly bound egg box structure in the presence of ca2 24 thus the strong foulant foulant adhesion resulted in faster accumulation of sa and more severe membrane fouling in the fo process 25 in contrast the water flux and srsf were not drastically affected by the bsa fouling layer the bsa acidity was stabilized at 1 1 5 meq g whereas the stabilized acidities of sa and ha were at 3 5 meq g and 3 3 meq g respectively 26 27 therefore the presence of cations ca2 in the feed solution would not significantly affect bsa fouling due to the low content of carboxylic groups in bsa compared to those of sa and ha 3 2 impact of organic fouling layers on the rejection of mps 3 2 1 effect of molecular weight the rejection of mps by the fo membrane is mainly governed by their physicochemical properties such as molecular weight charge and hydrophobicity 11 fig 2 presents the changes in the rejection of mps in virgin and organic fouled fo membranes according to their molecular weights our previous study showed that the rejection efficiency of neutral mps in the fo process was mainly governed by a size exclusion mechanism 12 however in the current experiment the rejection of higher mw compounds shows a different rejection tendency depending on the type of organic fouling layers in the case of the bsa and ha fouled membrane the rejection efficiencies of low molecular weight mps 200 g mol increased after the formation of organic fouling layers but that of high mw compounds 200 g mol was not changed or even decreased in the sa fouled membrane we concluded that in addition to the impact of mw on the rejection of mps solute properties in the presence of organic fouling layers on the fo membrane surface should also be considered importantly and thus it was necessary to consider other physicochemical factors such as the changes in hydrophobicity charge and adsorption during the formation of organic fouling layer 3 2 2 effect of solute charge and hydrophobicity 3 2 2 1 neutral compounds fig 3 presents the change in rejection efficiency of the virgin and organic fouled fo membranes for neutral mps act and cff with low molecular weight mw exhibited significantly lower rejection efficiencies by the virgin membranes than those of higher molecular weight compounds such as cbz lnr and tcs due to the steric interaction according to the molecular weight cut off mwco of the fo membrane 200 da 12 however the rejection of neutral mps changed dramatically after the formation of organic fouling layers on the fo membranes the rejection of act and cff which had lower log kow increased after the formation of the organic fouling layer while the rejection of mps with higher kow decreased significantly it has been reported that the rejection of mps is generally increased by enhanced steric hindrance of the organic fouling layer 17 however the rejection efficiencies of mps with a relatively high log kow 2 with the rejection efficiencies of the cbz lnr and tcs were decreased and it became more pronounced with an increase of kow the kow is the ratio of a chemical s concentration in the octanol phase to its concentration in the aqueous phase of a two phase system at equilibrium and describes a chemical s lipophilic or hydrophobic properties thus the hydrophobic interaction between mps and organic fouling layers played important roles during the transport of mps through fo membranes similar findings have been reported in the nanofiltration nf ro membrane processes 28 29 that the hydrophobic adsorption of mps into organic fouling layer induced an increased diffusion of mps to permeate stream experiments to verify potential mechanisms are further discussed in section 3 3 3 2 2 2 charged compounds the charge of mps is one of the major factors determining the transport through organic fouled fo membranes as illustrated in fig 4 all of the negatively charged mps showed high rejection efficiencies above 95 in both virgin and organic fouled fo membranes due to the negatively charged virgin membrane surfaces and organic fouling layers these results were consistent with previous findings that negatively charged mps showed higher rejection efficiency than neutral mps in fouled fo membranes 15 16 in contrast the rejection of positively charged mps was significantly changed in the presence of organic fouling layers for the positively charged solutes the virgin membrane surfaces which have negatively charged surfaces promote the adsorption of mps and increases the concentration of mps in the polymeric structure of fo membrane which results in the increased mass transfer to the permeate stream and thus the decrease in the rejection of positively charged mps 28 as shown in fig 4 b the overall rejection efficiency of positively charged mps in the bsa fouled membrane was slightly higher than that of the virgin membrane the rejection of att and tmp in the sa fouled fo membrane decreased to 72 9 and 77 7 compared to the rejection in the virgin membrane 92 4 and 90 3 respectively in particular the rejection efficiency of att which had a high log kow value dramatically decreased in the sa fouled membrane the changes in the rejection of hydrophobic mps in nf and ro membranes were investigated by several researchers 29 31 according to jang et al 12 the adsorption of mps into the fo membrane polymer structure resulted in an elevated concentration gradient of mps across the fo membrane and thus facilitated the transport of mps to the permeate stream it also explained why the overall rejection efficiency of positively charged mps in the bsa fouled membrane was slightly higher than that of the virgin membrane as shown in fig 4 b that smallest mass of mps was adsorbed into the less negatively charged bsa layer thus the less amount of mps was diffused into the permeate stream the adsorption of mps into the fouling layer is further discussed in the following section 3 3 role of organic fouling layer during the rejection of mps 3 3 1 adsorption capacities of mps as discussed in the previous section the rejection of mps was significantly changed once organic fouling layers were formed on the fo membrane surfaces we hypothesized that hydrophobic mps are preferentially adsorbed into the fouling layer of organic matter and the locally elevated concentrations of highly adsorbed mps will facilitate transport to the permeated side to investigate the adsorption of mps to organic foulants organic foulant coated silica particles were mixed with mps and the adsorption capacities of mps were evaluated fig 5 shows the adsorption capacities of mps to the ha bsa and sa coated silica particles as expected neutral and positively charged mps showed significantly higher adsorption capacities than negatively charged mps as presented in fig 5 the adsorption capacity of mps was increased with an increase of kow due to the hydrophobic interactions with the hydrophobic structural parts of organic foulants moreover the electrical charge of mps also played a critical role in the adsorption capacity of mps interestingly sa showed higher adsorption capacities of mps compared to ha or bsa and the adsorption capacity of tcs with sa molecules was 1 5 μg mg which was the highest value among the selected mps this could be due to the strong adhesion between hydrophobic mps and sa molecules arising from the unique characteristics of the sa intermolecular structure when the sa molecules are combined with divalent ions e g calcium the sa layer is composed of cross linked long chain molecules which is called an egg box structure 32 this unique structure of sa molecules offers additional adsorption sites for contaminants 33 the adsorption capacities of negatively charged mps onto the organic matter were relatively lower than those of neutral and positively charged compounds regardless of their hydrophobicity this is because the organic matter in this study was also negatively charged supplementary data table s2 and thus electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged mps and organic matter prevented their adsorption on the organic matter the above results provide important insights into the interaction between mps and macromolecules as shown in figs 2 and 3 the rejection efficiency was decreased depending on the mps charge and kow and the rejection efficiencies of mps dramatically decreased in the sa fouled fo membrane from the adsorption test between solute and organic foulants the sa molecules showed the highest mps adsorption capacities the increased mass of adsorbed mps in the sa fouling layer induced locally higher mp concentrations and thus facilitated the diffusional transport of mps across the active layer of the membranes 34 however the ha and bsa fouling layer had relatively lower adsorption affinity with mps than the sa layer therefore we can conclude that the differences in the adsorption capacity with mps and the organic fouling layer structure might result in different transport behavior in the fo process 3 3 2 influence of solute foulant interactions on mps rejection to reveal the impact of elevated concentrations of mps on the rejection efficiencies of organically fouled fo membranes the amount of adsorbed mps versus the changes in rejection efficiencies of mps before and after formation of organic fouling layers are plotted in fig 6 it shows that the changes in rejection efficiencies during the formation of organic fouling layer becomes more significant with an increasing adsorption capacity of organic foulants with a pearson correlation coefficient r of 0 7064 therefore during the rejection of mps by fo membranes the impact of the organic fouling layer should be considered carefully otherwise the rejection will be either underestimated or overestimated depending on the solute foulant interaction during the formation of organic fouling layer mainly due to the adsorption or charge interaction between mps and organic fouling layers notably the difference in rejection between virgin and organic fouled membranes becomes more pronounced when positively charged and neutral mps with a high kow are involved 3 3 3 mp rejection after physical cleaning physical cleaning was conducted by increasing the cross flow velocity from 9 cm s to 15 cm s to investigate the change of mp rejection efficiency after removing the organic fouling layer because of the fouling reversibility due to a lack of applied hydraulic pressure 35 97 8 of the initial water flux was recovered after physical cleaning fig s1 fig 7 presents a comparison of the rejection efficiency of tcs and att before and after the physical cleaning which dramatically changed the rejection efficiencies after the formation of the sa fouling layer in figs 3 and 4 as discussed in section 3 3 1 the rejection of tcs and att decreased after the formation of sa fouling layers due to the favorable adsorption of tcs and att onto sa however the rejection efficiencies were fully recovered after physical cleaning this result confirms that the decrease in rejection of hydrophobic compounds by sa fouling mainly originates from locally increased concentration polarization by adsorption of mps in the membrane fouling layer 4 conclusion this study investigated the effects of organic fouling layers on the rejection of mps that were relevant to wastewater reuse by the fo process the changes in mp rejection efficiency were influenced by solute foulant interactions between organic fouling layers and mps the negatively charged mps were most effectively rejected due to the presence of repulsive electrostatic interactions with virgin or organically fouled membranes however the rejection of neutral or positively charged mps with high kow significantly decreased after the formation of the organic fouling layers this was due to the adsorption of mps into the organic fouling layers induced by hydrophobic or counter charge interactions the elevated concentration of mps in the organic fouling layers facilitates their diffusion to the permeate stream and thus the rejection efficiency decreased dramatically in the organically fouled fo membrane the results of this study suggest that the formation of an organic fouling layer on the fo membrane surface could significantly alter the rejection of mps that the removal of positively charged and neutral mps with high kow could be overestimated when the rejection tests are carried out in the absence of organic fouling layers thus the rejection of mps should be carefully monitored during the operation of fo membrane processes declaration of competing interest

13173,various studies have focused on the photocatalytic remediation of toxic organic contaminants in water but low light utilization and difficult catalyst recovery hindered the prospect of industrial scale application of photocatalytic technology the dispersion of photocatalysts into the solution is the major cause of these shortcomings in this work an alternative strategy of sequential adsorption followed by photocatalytic degradation was verified this strategy operated photocatalysis on the solid phase saturated with contaminants which not only avoided the absorption and barrier of light by water but also the regenerated catalyst can be directly used for the next cycle for this h3po4 modified tio2 nanoparticles loaded on biochar p tio2 bc was used to adsorb dyes and then the collected adsorbent was directly illuminated to degrade the adsorbed dyes p tio2 bc was characterized by xrd ftir xps sem uv vis drs and n2 adsorption desorption technologies the influence of solution ph on the adsorption of p tio2 bc as well as the adsorption kinetics isotherms and desorption was investigated photocatalystic experiments showed that the adsorbed dyes can be completely degraded the free radical trapping experiments and electron spin resonance were performed to examine the mechanism of dye degradation in the meantime the adsorbent regenerated by solid phase photocatalysis can be reused several times with higher regeneration rates 88 1 69 3 this work should provide an available approach for the photocatalytic treatment of water pollution and the photo regeneration of adsorbents graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption photocatalysis solid phase photo degradation tio2 nanoparticles biochar 1 introduction photocatalytic oxidation degradation of organic contaminants has great attraction in treatment of polluted water due to its powerful degradability and energy cleanliness massive literatures have reported that various organic pollutants e g antibiotics pesticides dyes and oil can be destructed by the highly reactive radicals e g oh o2 produced in photocatalysis 1 4 in the past few decades the development of photocatalytic technology has mainly focused on how to improve the separation of photo generated electron hole pairs of catalysts e g ion doping surface modification constructing heterostructures 5 9 however two practical problems are also bottleneck to restrict the industrial scale application of photocatalytic technology in sewage treatment 10 12 one is how to improve the light utilization and the other is how to increase the recycle rate of the catalyst during photocatalysis it is a common operation to disperse the heterogeneous photocatalysts into the solution to facilitate the adsorption of pollutants and the diffusion of degraded intermediates and products at the solid liquid interface unfortunately this also brought about the fatal loss of light energy and the difficulty of catalyst recovery it has been reported that only about 20 of visible light and 1 of uv light can penetrate to underwater 0 5 m due to the absorption and barrier of water 13 14 to solve these fatal problems the floating photocatalysts immobilized on a lightweight support was developed compared with the unfloatable catalysts floating photocatalysts naturally produces many benefits 10 13 15 18 i the light can be directly irradiated on the photocatalyst without loss in transmission through aqueous phase ii the photocatalysis that occurs at the aqueous air interface can receive both sufficient o2 and h2o and iii the post treatment recovery and separation can be attained through simply sieving that also avoids mass loss of catalyst however the applications of floating photocatalyst still remain in laboratory or pilot plant scale due to the lower efficiency and higher cost 13 adsorption is considered as the promising method for removal aqueous contaminants as it has several advantages such high efficiency simple operation and technologically feasible processes 19 but adsorption is usually required a combination of other methods to eliminate pollutants that are transferred from the solution to the solid phase for example photocatalytic regeneration of spent adsorbents is an efficient operation 20 24 in the previous reports the photo regeneration process was often completed in the solution and the weakening effect of water on the photocatalytic efficiency still exists directly irradiating the photocatalyst loaded adsorbent should have it both ways it can not only avoid the blocking of light by water layer but also remit the recovery problem caused by the redispersed adsorbent in addition the works of wang et al exhibited that the solid gas photocatalytic reaction facilitated the absorption of light by the catalyst and the migration of the adsorbed toluene on the activated carbon support 25 however the strategy of sequential combined adsorption and solid phase photocatalysis was rarely reported in photocatalytic remediation of water the main reason seems to be that the degradation intermediates or products are not always volatile but form carbon deposits and deactivate the photocatalyst 26 27 in spite of this it is rational that the solid phase photocatalytic strategy should offer some foreseeable advantages for example the photocatalyst is directly exposed to light without barrier and it can be regenerated after photocatalysis on solid phase therefore solid phase photodegradation should be a simple approach that could be attempted in this work we report a slightly compromised strategy of sequential combined adsorption and photocatalysis where the saturated adsorbent was kept wet during the photocatalytic process instead of being completely immersed in the solution in this way not only the light can directly irradiate the photocatalyst but the wettability of catalyst can also ensure the diffusion of the degraded intermediates specifically phosphoric acid modified tio2 p25 supported on biochar p tio2 bc was used as an adsorptive photocatalyst to remove dye pollutants in the aqueous solution after that the collected p tio2 bc dyes were directly irradiated to degrade the dyes in the solid phase the results showed that the adsorbed dyes could be completely degraded moreover p tio2 bc can be reused in the next run of dye adsorption without any post treatment 2

sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china the experimental water was self made deionized water di water 2 2 preparation of p tio2 bc the jute fiber derived biochars were prepared by a modified h3po4 pretreated and pyrolytic method in our recent report 28 specifically the jute pieces of 10 0 g were mixed with 11 87 ml h3po4 85 wt and then an appropriate amount of di water was added to the mixture until the solids are covered after the mixture was sealed for 24 h it was dried in vacuum at 60 c to remove free moisture the resulted solid was transferred into a ceramic crucible the pyrolysis was executed in a box type furnace before heating the furnace nitrogen gas n2 was purged to replace the air inside the chamber then the furnace was heated to 200 c at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 and kept it for 45 min the temperature was further increased to 450 c at the same heating rate and held it for 120 min after it was naturally cooled to room temperature the carbonized material was taken out and washed with hot di water several times and dried at 110 c to obtain jute fiber based porous chars the resultant biochars 5 0 g were blended with tio2 powders 0 5 g and then 10 ml

under n2 protection the solid was washed until the washing liquid is neutral and thus h3po4 modified tio2 nanoparticles loaded on biochars p tio2 bc were obtained after drying 2 3 characterization x

chosen respectively as representatives of cationic and anionic dyes to investigate the adsorptive performance properties related to both dyes such as chemical structure and molecular weight were shown in the table s1 the reaction flask was maintained the temperature of 30 1 c by a thermostatic water circulation the stock solution 1 00 g l 1 was prepared by dissolving 1 00 g dyes in 1000 ml di water which was further diluted to the required concentration before use the solution ph was adjusted by adding naoh or hcl solution 0 1 mol l 1 in a typical experiment 100 ml of dye solution c 0 20 250 mg l 1 was poured into the flask with a fixed amount of biochar 60 mg and the flask was oscillated at a certain interval 5 ml of the suspension was withdrawn and centrifuged quickly for solid liquid separation the residual dye concentration c in liquid was analyzed by a spectrophotometer metash uv 9000s shanghai at the maximum absorption wavelength 664 4 nm for mb fig s1 and 498 0 nm for cr fig s2 the removal ratio by adsorption was calculated according to eq 1 1 removal ratio c 0 c c 0 100 the pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso and intraparticle diffusion ipd models were used to deal with kinetic data and langmuir freundlich and redlich peterson models were selected to describe isotherm adsorption data the detailed information about these models was given in the table s2 the saturated adsorbent was desorbed by solvent elution the adsorbed mb was eluted by methanol ac mixed solvent me ac volume ratio 95 5 and cr was desorbed by methanol according to previous report 29 typically 60 mg saturated adsorbent was oscillated in 20 ml eluent for 15 min and this operation was repeated 5 times the supernatants collected by centrifugation were combined together and the concentration of supernatant was measured with a spectrophotometer metash uv 9000s shanghai to eliminate the influence of the solvent on the maximum absorption wavelength the working curve was calibrated with a standard solution prepared by the corresponding eluent to replace water figs s3 s4 the desorption ratio was calculated according to eq 2 2 desorption ratio amount of desorbed dye in eluent amount of adsorbed dye 100 2 5 in situ degradation of dyes on adsorbent solid the in situ degradation of adsorbed dyes was carried out on a self made simple device fig s5 the spent p tio2 bc was collected on a round filter paper spread out and placed in a small dark chamber a xenon lamp cel lax500 500 w 200 2200 nm with a cut off filter 400 nm was used to feed visible light the lamp was installed at a height of 10 cm from the adsorbent and the average light intensity reaching the surface of the adsorbent was measured to be around 1500 mw cm 2 during the xenon lamp irradiation di water was sprayed on the adsorbent occasionally to keep it wet after irradiation for a fixed time the adsorbent was treated with the above mentioned desorption method and a certain volume of eluent was taken for absorption spectroscopy and hplc agilent 1100 usa analysis to determine the degradation of the dye molecules the degradation ratio of dyes was estimated by eq 3 3 degradation ratio 1 c r v w q e 100 where c r is the concentration of dyes in eluent mg l 1 v w is the volume of eluent consumed per unit mass of adsorbent l g 1 and q e is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g 1 2 6 reusability after the in situ degradation was over the recovered adsorbent was dried and used to re adsorb dyes the operating conditions were the same as those of the fresh adsorbent for comparison elution and thermal regenerations were also performed the elution regeneration used the same method with the desorption above the thermal regeneration was operated to heat treat spent adsorbent at 150 c for 6 h the regeneration efficiency re was estimated according to eq 4 4 re q r q 0 100 where q 0 is the adsorption capacity of fresh sorbent and q r is the adsorption capacity of regeneration sorbent mg g 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization 3 1 1 spectroscopy fig 1a shows the xrd patterns of bc and p tio2 bc it reflects the diffraction lines of anatase jcpds no 21 1272 and rutile jcpds no 21 1276 phases in the pattern of p tio2 bc from tio2 nanoparticles the signals of bc are observed at 2θ 24 30 002 and 43 00 10 appearing as broad peaks like most biochars pyrolyzed 28 30 31 fig 1b shows the ftir spectra of bc and p tio2 bc with similar absorption peaks indicating that the asymmetric vibration of surface functional groups mainly originated from bc for example oh 3435 cm 1 ch ch2 2925 2851 cm 1 and co 1616 cm 1 the strong doublet centered at 1161 and 1115 cm 1 can be ascribed to the existence of phosphor containing carbonaceous structures like phosphates and pyrophosphates duo to the pretreatment of h3po4 28 32 33 xps was applied to further analyze the composition and valence state of elements from fig 2a c o p and ti elements were detected on the surface of p tio2 bc but ti was absent in bc their relative atomic percent is listed in table 1 the core level xps of o1s p2p and ti2p is displayed in fig 2b c from the resolution of o1s of bc bands of co po 531 21 ev co po 532 92 ev and oco opo 535 28 ev can be identified meaning that the groups containing these chemical bonds presented on the surface of biochar such as phenol ketone carboxyl phosphate etc 30 34 35 in p tio2 bc the lattice oxygen of tio2 is easily distinguishable in characteristic binding energy of 530 01 ev meanwhile the peak at higher binding energy has disappeared the result reflects that tio2 crystals are covalently linked to biochar through carboxyl phosphate groups etc 36 37 the asymmetric ti2p doublet can be resolved into two bands respectively corresponding to lattice ti tilatt and surface ti tisurf atoms the appearance of tisurf meant that the partial lattice oxygen was substituted by hydroxyl carboxyl or phosphate groups 38 additionally the po and pc bonds can be observed in p2p lines the emergence of cp bond indicated that partial p atoms are incorporated into the carbon matrix as a reduced state 39 3 1 2 textural properties the textural properties of bc and p tio2 bc were analyzed by n2 adsorption desorption measurements the isotherms are presented in fig 3 and the main parameters are tabulated table 2 it is found that the isotherms of bc and p tio2 bc exhibited a similar feature i iv type iupac the result indicated that the incorporation of tio2 nanoparticles did not significantly change the porous characteristics from bc fig 3 also displays a weak hysteresis loop in the high pressure region which is bound up with the appearance of mesopores and macropores 40 from the data in table 2 the ratio of mesopore area s meso to specific surface area ssa and mesopore volume v meso to total pore volume exceeds 45 and 70 respectively the average pore diameters d a reach about 3 4 nm and are located in the mesoporous region the sem images fig 4 show that the pristine biochar has a lotus root like axially porous structure derived from the feedstocks and tio2 particles are coated on the biochar surface in p tio2 bc 3 1 3 optical properties fig 5 displays the drs of bc p tio2 and p tio2 bc it is clear that the light absorption of p tio2 bc was noticeably enhanced in the uv and visible ranges due to the incorporation of bc intrinsic absorption 41 42 the bandgaps energy e g of p tio2 and p tio2 bc was assessed through tauc plot the kubelka munk function ahv 1 2 is plotted against bandgap energy e g hv where a is absorbance h is the plank s constant and v is the frequency of radiation the e g is then assessed by extrapolating the linear portion of graph to y axis zero value 41 43 fig 5b shows the e g of p tio2 is estimated to be 3 15 ev which is slightly less than the intrinsic e g of raw tio2 3 2 ev and the e g of p tio2 bc is significantly narrowed to 2 53 ev the results reflected the boosted visible light absorption of p tio2 bc composite and also suggested the possible formation of new energy states in p tio2 bc due to the covalent action of p tio2 with surface groups in bc 41 44 45 3 2 adsorption 3 2 1 ph effect the effect of initial solution ph on the dye removal efficiency was investigated over the ph ranges of 3 10 for mb and 6 11 for cr solutions with initial dye concentration of 100 mg l 1 the higher ph for mb solution and lower ph for cr were not chosen duo to the possible changes of maximum absorption within these ph regions figs s1 and s2 fig 6 shows the variations of adsorption efficiency under different ph it is found that p tio2 bc offered higher removal ratio than bc within the selected ph ranges regardless of whether mb or cr was adsorbed indicating that the incorporation of tio2 nanoparticles increased the adsorption active sites however the effect of ph on mb and cr adsorption is different in the case of mb the maximum removal ratio 99 onto p tio2 bc and 96 onto bc was obtained at higher alkalinity ph 10 as the ph decreased the adsorption efficiency gradually decreased for cr uptake the maximum removal ratio 97 onto p tio2 bc and 92 onto bc was presented at lower ph the adsorption efficiency generally decreased with the increase of ph the difference in trend with ph can be explained from the surface charge distribution of the adsorbent mb and cr was used as cationic and anionic dyes respectively and their adsorbed amount was affected by the changes in the surface charge of the bc and p tio2 bc at different ph fig s6 it is observed that at the neutral ph the adsorption capacity is lower than the neighbours this may be due to the fact that the point of zero charge of the adsorbents just appeared 3 2 2 influence of sorbent dosage the influence of dosage on the adsorptive efficiencies was shown in fig 7 it is observed that with the increasing amount of sorbent the removal ratios were gradually raised to over 98 when the dosage reached about 0 6 g l 1 the increase rate became no longer obvious meanwhile the adsorbent capacity decreased significantly as the dosage increased therefore 0 6 g l 1 is a dose that takes into account both efficiency and cost for mb and cr removals 3 2 3 kinetic and isotherm adsorption kinetics was applied to explicate the mass transfer of adsorbates at the solid liquid interface and the adsorptive mechanism the selected kinetic equations were provided in table s2 fig 8a b show the adsorption kinetic data and the fitted parameters are presented in table 3 to compare fig 8a with fig 8b it is observed that the mass transfer processes differed significantly between the two dye molecules in the case of mb it is divided into a fast adsorption stage 0 30 min and a slow equilibrium stage 30 120 min while for cr the adsorptive equilibrium was slowly reached until about 600 min the regression parameters from kinetic data revealed that the pseudo second order pso model met the adsorption of mb better the result suggested that chemisorption dominated the uptake of mb and the adsorption mechanism was considered bonding forces 46 however both the pseudo first order pfo and pso models can be well fitted for cr adsorption indicating the coexistence of chemisorption and physisorption in cr removal 47 moreover pore and intra particle diffusion are often rate limiting in the mass transfer from solution into solid phase 48 it is shown that cr adsorption obeyed intra particle diffusion ipd equation well and the intercept of fitted straight line was near the origin fig s7 table 3 suggesting that the uptake of cr is a process controlled by intra particle diffusion the adsorption of mb could not be fitted by ipd model but involved in two linear stages i e intra particle diffusion and external surface binding suggesting that the intra particle diffusion is not the exclusive rate limiting step 49 fig 8c d display the adsorption isotherms and table 3 lists regression parameters which further revealed the adsorption mechanism the data analysis shows that both langmuir and freundlich models table s2 can well fit the relationship between the adsorption capacity and the equilibrium concentration with the initial dye concentration as a variable however the fittings of redlich peterson equation with the third dimensionless parameter β were better due to the higher correlation coefficient r 2 0 975 0 990 indicating that the solute uptake was monolayer chemisorption in low concentration while it may have adsorbate stacking in high concentration solutions 50 moreover it is found that the monolayer maximum adsorption capacity q m of p tio2 bc to mb and cr exceeded 200 mg g 1 which is higher than the reported values of many biochar based adsorbents 29 41 51 the high specific surface area abundant pore structure and modification of nano tio2 can explain the high adsorption capacity of p tio2 bc 51 3 3 desorption the desorption of mb and cr was eluted with me ac and me solvents respectively fig 9 shows the adsorbed mb and cr can almost completely desorbed at the first run with solvent elution as the number of cycles increases however the desorption efficiency of cr dropped sharply to only about 20 while the desorption efficiency of mb remained above 90 during five runs this result indicates that there is a stronger force between cr and the adsorbent and the uneluted cr molecules would gradually accumulate on the adsorbent notability di water has also been investigated for desorption but the results showed that it can hardly elute the adsorbed dye molecules data not shown desorption ratio 5 in the present work the photo degradation of adsorbed dyes was performed over the solid it is difficult to quantitatively analyze the degraded dyes in the sorbent the adsorbed dye molecules can be completely eluted with me ac or me solvents this provided an indirect way to determine the amount of remaining dye in other words the efficiency of solid phase photo degradation can be quantified by measuring the undegraded dye in the eluate the absorbance test of dye solutions with different concentrations showed the working curve offered a perfect linear relationship r 2 0 999 fig s3 fig 4 3 4 in situ photo degradation of adsorbed dyes the in situ photo degradation of adsorbed dyes was evaluated by directly irradiating the collected adsorbent under visible light fig 10a shows the degradation ratio of mb and cr dyes onto bc and p tio2 bc sorbents over varying time it can be observed that bc has a moderate photo activity to degrade mb and cr dyes 65 and 52 degradation ratio for mb and cr respectively other research and our previous work have adequately demonstrated that the pyrolyzed chars with various surface groups offered photocatalytic activity to degrade aqueous organic pollutant 44 52 54 after tio2 nanoparticles were loaded the enhanced dye degradation degradation ratio 99 is observed to compare with the pristine bc the reactive species such as superoxide free radicals o2 hydroxyl radicals oh and holes h are recognized to oxidatively degrade organic pollutants in semiconductor photocatalysis 27 44 to investigate the effect of these active reactants on the degradation of dye molecules the free radical and holes trapping experiments were carried out the aqueous solution where quencher was dissolved was sprayed on the adsorbent instead of di water to examine its effect on the degradation efficiency isopropanol ipa ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta p benzoquinone pbq were selected as oh h and o2 quenchers respectively 55 and the result is shown in fig 10b the figure exhibits that all three quenchers have inhibited the degradation of mb suggesting that the three active species were present during photocatalysis however the degree of inhibition varied depending on the quenchers when ipa was added into the reaction the photo degradation of mb was distinctly suppressed but the inhibition of edta and pbq was unconspicuous based on the quenching experiments oh radicals played a crucial role in photo degradation process the photo production of oh is considered as eqs 5 10 36 41 45 upon illumination p tio2 bc receives the photon energy and electron hole pairs are generated within tio2 conduction band e cb and valence band h vb eq 5 the photo generated holes can directly react with oh to produce oh radicals according to holes trapping experiment however the depression effect of edta on mb degradation was less than that of ipa and thus oh radicals should also be produced by other means eqs 7 10 give the other ways to generate oh radicals the o2 radicals produced by the reaction of e cb with adsorbed dissolved o2 act with protons to form hydrogen peroxide h2o2 which splits to generate oh radicals the o2 radicals can also further react with h2o2 to generate oh radicals while releasing hydroxide anions and oxygen eq 10 eventually these accumulated reactive free radicals oxidize the dye molecules to cause dye degradation this series of reactions revealed that sufficient oxygen supply was important for photocatalytic oxidative degradation of organic pollutants 27 56 in the solid phase photocatalysis photons can not only reach the catalyst surface directly but the fully exposed air water interface ensured sufficient oxygen and moisture supply 5 p tio 2 bc hv h vb tio

was further confirmed by ers measurement fig 11a shows a symmetric esr signal of p tio2 bc mb at centered 2 004 g factor when the visible light was turned on the signals can be assigned to single electron trapped oxygen vacancies setovs on the surface which is inextricably related to the presence of oxygenated radicals like o2 o and o3 ers has been regularly applied to investigate the initial steps of photocatalytic reactions between the adsorbed molecules and the solid surface 45 56 58 moreover the photo generated electron hole pairs in the bulk must be separated and transferred to surface and captured by surface traps otherwise redox reactions of the adsorbed reactants cannot occur thereon for this the pl performance of p tio2 bc mb was measured to confirm the effective separation of photo generated charge carriers as a comparison the pl spectrum of p tio2 mb was also measured as shown in fig 11b it is distinct that p tio2 bc mb is seized of lower pl curve than p tio2 mb corresponding to a lower recombination of e cb h vb pairs due to the incorporation of hetero structured bc through the covalent bond between p tio2 and bc i e ti o c and ti o p bc can transfer and receive electrons thereby promoting the separation of e cb h vb pairs 41 44 45 59 based on the experimental results and above analysis the graphical presentation of the in situ photo degradation mechanism is displayed in fig 12 briefly upon the visible light irradiation the electrons excited from vb to the intra band 2 53 ev were trapped by setovs leaving holes in vb the holes react with oh to generate oh radicals the trapped electrons react with o2 to produce o2 radicals which further attack h2o resulting in h2o2 h2o2 may disintegrate to produce oh radicals these highly reactive radicals attack dye molecules to degrade them the degradation products may be small molecule intermediates or be thoroughly mineralized into co2 and water including nitrate sulfate etc 60 61 3 5 reusability after the in situ photo degradation was accomplished the recycled p tio2 bc re adsorbed mb dyes to investigate the reusability the comparison experiment was performed on the adsorbents of thermal regeneration and solvent elution regeneration as well as the photo regeneration without water sprayed fig 13 presents the variation of regeneration efficiency for five cycles in the four regeneration modes it is observed that solvent elution me ac is the most effective way of regeneration and the regeneration efficiency in five cycles remains above 82 however solvent elution is a phase transfer regeneration rather than destructive and the toxic dyes still exist in the liquid phase the photo and thermal regeneration can eliminate organic pollutants and fig 13 shows that the efficiency of photo regeneration 88 1 69 3 is significantly better than thermal regeneration 83 1 25 6 the photo regeneration maintained a higher and stable regeneration rate during five cycles moreover xrd and ftir measurements exhibited that phase constituents and surface groups of the recycled p tio2 bc kept basically unchanged under photo regeneration figs s8 s9 the ssa and v total values decreased from 1747 8 to 1343 2 m2 g 1 and from 1 57 to 1 03 cm3 g 1 respectively fig s10 the results show that it is feasible to recover and reuse the adsorbent several times under photo regeneration however it is very important to keep the adsorbent surface wet during the photo regeneration otherwise the regeneration rate will drop sharply from 75 to only 15 after five runs the reason for this may be that the degradation intermediates cannot diffuse in time and form carbon deposits on the surface thereby deactivating the photocatalyst 26 27 62 the exact reason will be studied in depth in next works in general the solid phase photo regeneration is quite a useful regeneration method which not only guaranteed a higher regeneration efficiency in multiple cycles but also maintained relatively stable in the structure surface functional groups and textural properties of the adsorbent 4 conclusion p tio2 bc demonstrated a higher dyes adsorption capacity than bc the adsorption of mb onto p tio2 bc obeyed pso kinetic model and redlich peterson isotherm the q m value of mb was estimated to be 223 4 mg g 1 at 30 c the uptake of cr onto p tio2 bc complied with ipd kinetic model and redlich peterson isotherm the q m value was 208 9 mg g 1 at 30 c mb and cr adsorbed by p tio2 bc can be wholly desorbed by solvent elution with me ac and me respectively importantly the adsorbed dye molecules can be degraded in the solid phase and the wettability of the solid phase is very important to maintain the degradation rate of dye molecules the reactive species of oh and o2 radicals and h were identified to oxidize dyes degradation in which oh radicals played a leading role the adsorbent regenerated by solid phase photocatalysis can be reused several times while maintaining a stable structure and high efficient re adsorption rate this work allows to provide an alternative strategy for sequential combined adsorptive and photocatalytic removal of aqueous organic pollutants in the next work the degradation of contaminants of emerging concern pesticides ppcps etc will be used to examine the effectiveness of this strategy and to understand the mechanism

13173,various studies have focused on the photocatalytic remediation of toxic organic contaminants in water but low light utilization and difficult catalyst recovery hindered the prospect of industrial scale application of photocatalytic technology the dispersion of photocatalysts into the solution is the major cause of these shortcomings in this work an alternative strategy of sequential adsorption followed by photocatalytic degradation was verified this strategy operated photocatalysis on the solid phase saturated with contaminants which not only avoided the absorption and barrier of light by water but also the regenerated catalyst can be directly used for the next cycle for this h3po4 modified tio2 nanoparticles loaded on biochar p tio2 bc was used to adsorb dyes and then the collected adsorbent was directly illuminated to degrade the adsorbed dyes p tio2 bc was characterized by xrd ftir xps sem uv vis drs and n2 adsorption desorption technologies the influence of solution ph on the adsorption of p tio2 bc as well as the adsorption kinetics isotherms and desorption was investigated photocatalystic experiments showed that the adsorbed dyes can be completely degraded the free radical trapping experiments and electron spin resonance were performed to examine the mechanism of dye degradation in the meantime the adsorbent regenerated by solid phase photocatalysis can be reused several times with higher regeneration rates 88 1 69 3 this work should provide an available approach for the photocatalytic treatment of water pollution and the photo regeneration of adsorbents graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption photocatalysis solid phase photo degradation tio2 nanoparticles biochar 1 introduction photocatalytic oxidation degradation of organic contaminants has great attraction in treatment of polluted water due to its powerful degradability and energy cleanliness massive literatures have reported that various organic pollutants e g antibiotics pesticides dyes and oil can be destructed by the highly reactive radicals e g oh o2 produced in photocatalysis 1 4 in the past few decades the development of photocatalytic technology has mainly focused on how to improve the separation of photo generated electron hole pairs of catalysts e g ion doping surface modification constructing heterostructures 5 9 however two practical problems are also bottleneck to restrict the industrial scale application of photocatalytic technology in sewage treatment 10 12 one is how to improve the light utilization and the other is how to increase the recycle rate of the catalyst during photocatalysis it is a common operation to disperse the heterogeneous photocatalysts into the solution to facilitate the adsorption of pollutants and the diffusion of degraded intermediates and products at the solid liquid interface unfortunately this also brought about the fatal loss of light energy and the difficulty of catalyst recovery it has been reported that only about 20 of visible light and 1 of uv light can penetrate to underwater 0 5 m due to the absorption and barrier of water 13 14 to solve these fatal problems the floating photocatalysts immobilized on a lightweight support was developed compared with the unfloatable catalysts floating photocatalysts naturally produces many benefits 10 13 15 18 i the light can be directly irradiated on the photocatalyst without loss in transmission through aqueous phase ii the photocatalysis that occurs at the aqueous air interface can receive both sufficient o2 and h2o and iii the post treatment recovery and separation can be attained through simply sieving that also avoids mass loss of catalyst however the applications of floating photocatalyst still remain in laboratory or pilot plant scale due to the lower efficiency and higher cost 13 adsorption is considered as the promising method for removal aqueous contaminants as it has several advantages such high efficiency simple operation and technologically feasible processes 19 but adsorption is usually required a combination of other methods to eliminate pollutants that are transferred from the solution to the solid phase for example photocatalytic regeneration of spent adsorbents is an efficient operation 20 24 in the previous reports the photo regeneration process was often completed in the solution and the weakening effect of water on the photocatalytic efficiency still exists directly irradiating the photocatalyst loaded adsorbent should have it both ways it can not only avoid the blocking of light by water layer but also remit the recovery problem caused by the redispersed adsorbent in addition the works of wang et al exhibited that the solid gas photocatalytic reaction facilitated the absorption of light by the catalyst and the migration of the adsorbed toluene on the activated carbon support 25 however the strategy of sequential combined adsorption and solid phase photocatalysis was rarely reported in photocatalytic remediation of water the main reason seems to be that the degradation intermediates or products are not always volatile but form carbon deposits and deactivate the photocatalyst 26 27 in spite of this it is rational that the solid phase photocatalytic strategy should offer some foreseeable advantages for example the photocatalyst is directly exposed to light without barrier and it can be regenerated after photocatalysis on solid phase therefore solid phase photodegradation should be a simple approach that could be attempted in this work we report a slightly compromised strategy of sequential combined adsorption and photocatalysis where the saturated adsorbent was kept wet during the photocatalytic process instead of being completely immersed in the solution in this way not only the light can directly irradiate the photocatalyst but the wettability of catalyst can also ensure the diffusion of the degraded intermediates specifically phosphoric acid modified tio2 p25 supported on biochar p tio2 bc was used as an adsorptive photocatalyst to remove dye pollutants in the aqueous solution after that the collected p tio2 bc dyes were directly irradiated to degrade the dyes in the solid phase the results showed that the adsorbed dyes could be completely degraded moreover p tio2 bc can be reused in the next run of dye adsorption without any post treatment 2 experimental 2 1 materials jute corchorus capsularis l fibers were purchased locally shattered to piece washed and dried before use tio2 p25 was provided by evonik degussa germany all chemicals used in the experiment were of analytical reagent a r phosphoric acid h3po4 85 wt methylene blue mb c16h18cln3s congo red cr c32h22n6na2o6s2 acetic acid ac c2h4o2 and methanol ch4o were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china the experimental water was self made deionized water di water 2 2 preparation of p tio2 bc the jute fiber derived biochars were prepared by a modified h3po4 pretreated and pyrolytic method in our recent report 28 specifically the jute pieces of 10 0 g were mixed with 11 87 ml h3po4 85 wt and then an appropriate amount of di water was added to the mixture until the solids are covered after the mixture was sealed for 24 h it was dried in vacuum at 60 c to remove free moisture the resulted solid was transferred into a ceramic crucible the pyrolysis was executed in a box type furnace before heating the furnace nitrogen gas n2 was purged to replace the air inside the chamber then the furnace was heated to 200 c at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 and kept it for 45 min the temperature was further increased to 450 c at the same heating rate and held it for 120 min after it was naturally cooled to room temperature the carbonized material was taken out and washed with hot di water several times and dried at 110 c to obtain jute fiber based porous chars the resultant biochars 5 0 g were blended with tio2 powders 0 5 g and then 10 ml h3po4 85 wt was added and sonicated for 30 min 59 khz 100 w sk500lh shanghai after the solid was filtered washed and dried it was moved to a resistance furnace for heat treatment at 200 c 120 min under n2 protection the solid was washed until the washing liquid is neutral and thus h3po4 modified tio2 nanoparticles loaded on biochars p tio2 bc were obtained after drying 2 3 characterization x

resonance esr spectrum was performed on bruker e580 spectrometer german 2 4 adsorption and desorption tests adsorption was tested in a batch isothermal mode methylene blue mb and congo red cr were chosen respectively as representatives of cationic and anionic dyes to investigate the adsorptive performance properties related to both dyes such as chemical structure and molecular weight were shown in the table s1 the reaction flask was maintained the temperature of 30 1 c by a thermostatic water circulation the stock solution 1 00 g l 1 was prepared by dissolving 1 00 g dyes in 1000 ml di water which was further diluted to the required concentration before use the solution ph was adjusted by adding naoh or hcl solution 0 1 mol l 1 in a typical experiment 100 ml of dye solution c 0 20 250 mg l 1 was poured into the flask with a fixed amount of biochar 60 mg and the flask was oscillated at a certain interval 5 ml of the suspension was withdrawn and centrifuged quickly for solid liquid separation the residual dye concentration c in liquid was analyzed by a spectrophotometer metash uv 9000s shanghai at the maximum absorption wavelength 664 4 nm for mb fig s1 and 498 0 nm for cr fig s2 the removal ratio by adsorption was calculated according to eq 1 1 removal ratio c 0 c c 0 100 the pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso and intraparticle diffusion ipd models were used to deal with kinetic data and langmuir freundlich and redlich peterson models were selected to describe isotherm adsorption data the detailed information about these models was given in the table s2 the saturated adsorbent was desorbed by solvent elution the adsorbed mb was eluted by methanol ac mixed solvent me ac volume ratio 95 5 and cr was desorbed by methanol according to previous report 29 typically 60 mg saturated adsorbent was oscillated in 20 ml eluent for 15 min and this operation was repeated 5 times the supernatants collected by centrifugation were combined together and the concentration of supernatant was measured with a spectrophotometer metash uv 9000s shanghai to eliminate the influence of the solvent on the maximum absorption wavelength the working curve was calibrated with a standard solution prepared by the corresponding eluent to replace water figs s3 s4 the desorption ratio was calculated according to eq 2 2 desorption ratio amount of desorbed dye in eluent amount of adsorbed dye 100 2 5 in situ degradation of dyes on adsorbent solid the in situ degradation of adsorbed dyes was carried out on a self made simple device fig s5 the spent p tio2 bc was collected on a round filter paper spread out and placed in a small dark chamber a xenon lamp cel lax500 500 w 200 2200 nm with a cut off filter 400 nm was used to feed visible light the lamp was installed at a height of 10 cm from the adsorbent and the average light intensity reaching the surface of the adsorbent was measured to be around 1500 mw cm 2 during the xenon lamp irradiation di water was sprayed on the adsorbent occasionally to keep it wet after irradiation for a fixed time the adsorbent was treated with the above mentioned desorption method and a certain volume of eluent was taken for absorption spectroscopy and hplc agilent 1100 usa analysis to determine the degradation of the dye molecules the degradation ratio of dyes was estimated by eq 3 3 degradation ratio 1 c r v w q e 100 where c r is the concentration of dyes in eluent mg l 1 v w is the volume of eluent consumed per unit mass of adsorbent l g 1 and q e is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g 1 2 6 reusability after the in situ degradation was over the recovered adsorbent was dried and used to re adsorb dyes the operating conditions were the same as those of the fresh adsorbent for comparison elution and thermal regenerations were also performed the elution regeneration used the same method with the desorption above the thermal regeneration was operated to heat treat spent adsorbent at 150 c for 6 h the regeneration efficiency re was estimated according to eq 4 4 re q r q 0 100 where q 0 is the adsorption capacity of fresh sorbent and q r is the adsorption capacity of regeneration sorbent mg g 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization 3 1 1 spectroscopy fig 1a shows the xrd patterns of bc and p tio2 bc it reflects the diffraction lines of anatase jcpds no 21 1272 and rutile jcpds no 21 1276 phases in the pattern of p tio2 bc from tio2 nanoparticles the signals of bc are observed at 2θ 24 30 002 and 43 00 10 appearing as broad peaks like most biochars pyrolyzed 28 30 31 fig 1b shows the ftir spectra of bc and p tio2 bc with similar absorption peaks indicating that the asymmetric vibration of surface functional groups mainly originated from bc for example oh 3435 cm 1 ch ch2 2925 2851 cm 1 and co 1616 cm 1 the strong doublet centered at 1161 and 1115 cm 1 can be ascribed to the existence of phosphor containing carbonaceous structures like phosphates and pyrophosphates duo to the pretreatment of h3po4 28 32 33 xps was applied to further analyze the composition and valence state of elements from fig 2a c o p and ti elements were detected on the surface of p tio2 bc but ti was absent in bc their relative atomic percent is listed in table 1 the core level xps of o1s p2p and ti2p is displayed in fig 2b c from the resolution of o1s of bc bands of co po 531 21 ev co po 532 92 ev and oco opo 535 28 ev can be identified meaning that the groups containing these chemical bonds presented on the surface of biochar such as phenol ketone carboxyl phosphate etc 30 34 35 in p tio2 bc the lattice oxygen of tio2 is easily distinguishable in characteristic binding energy of 530 01 ev meanwhile the peak at higher binding energy has disappeared the result reflects that tio2 crystals are covalently linked to biochar through carboxyl phosphate groups etc 36 37 the asymmetric ti2p doublet can be resolved into two bands respectively corresponding to lattice ti tilatt and surface ti tisurf atoms the appearance of tisurf meant that the partial lattice oxygen was substituted by hydroxyl carboxyl or phosphate groups 38 additionally the po and pc bonds can be observed in p2p lines the emergence of cp bond indicated that partial p atoms are incorporated into the carbon matrix as a reduced state 39 3 1 2 textural properties the textural properties of bc and p tio2 bc were analyzed by n2 adsorption desorption measurements the isotherms are presented in fig 3 and the main parameters are tabulated table 2 it is found that the isotherms of bc and p tio2 bc exhibited a similar feature i iv type iupac the result indicated that the incorporation of tio2 nanoparticles did not significantly change the porous characteristics from bc fig 3 also displays a weak hysteresis loop in the high pressure region which is bound up with the appearance of mesopores and macropores 40 from the data in table 2 the ratio of mesopore area s meso to specific surface area ssa and mesopore volume v meso to total pore volume exceeds 45 and 70 respectively the average pore diameters d a reach about 3 4 nm and are located in the mesoporous region the sem images fig 4 show that the pristine biochar has a lotus root like axially porous structure derived from the feedstocks and tio2 particles are coated on the biochar surface in p tio2 bc 3 1 3 optical properties fig 5 displays the drs of bc p tio2 and p tio2 bc it is clear that the light absorption of p tio2 bc was noticeably enhanced in the uv and visible ranges due to the incorporation of bc intrinsic absorption 41 42 the bandgaps energy e g of p tio2 and p tio2 bc was assessed through tauc plot the kubelka munk function ahv 1 2 is plotted against bandgap energy e g hv where a is absorbance h is the plank s constant and v is the frequency of radiation the e g is then assessed by extrapolating the linear portion of graph to y axis zero value 41 43 fig 5b shows the e g of p tio2 is estimated to be 3 15 ev which is slightly less than the intrinsic e g of raw tio2 3 2 ev and the e g of p tio2 bc is significantly narrowed to 2 53 ev the results reflected the boosted visible light absorption of p tio2 bc composite and also suggested the possible formation of new energy states in p tio2 bc due to the covalent action of p tio2 with surface groups in bc 41 44 45 3 2 adsorption 3 2 1 ph effect the effect of initial solution ph on the dye removal efficiency was investigated over the ph ranges of 3 10 for mb and 6 11 for cr solutions with initial dye concentration of 100 mg l 1 the higher ph for mb solution and lower ph for cr were not chosen duo to the possible changes of maximum absorption within these ph regions figs s1 and s2 fig 6 shows the variations of adsorption efficiency under different ph it is found that p tio2 bc offered higher removal ratio than bc within the selected ph ranges regardless of whether mb or cr was adsorbed indicating that the incorporation of tio2 nanoparticles increased the adsorption active sites however the effect of ph on mb and cr adsorption is different in the case of mb the maximum removal ratio 99 onto p tio2 bc and 96 onto bc was obtained at higher alkalinity ph 10 as the ph decreased the adsorption efficiency gradually decreased for cr uptake the maximum removal ratio 97 onto p tio2 bc and 92 onto bc was presented at lower ph the adsorption efficiency generally decreased with the increase of ph the difference in trend with ph can be explained from the surface charge distribution of the adsorbent mb and cr was used as cationic and anionic dyes respectively and their adsorbed amount was affected by the changes in the surface charge of the bc and p tio2 bc at different ph fig s6 it is observed that at the neutral ph the adsorption capacity is lower than the neighbours this may be due to the fact that the point of zero charge of the adsorbents just appeared 3 2 2 influence of sorbent dosage the influence of dosage on the adsorptive efficiencies was shown in fig 7 it is observed that with the increasing amount of sorbent the removal ratios were gradually raised to over 98 when the dosage reached about 0 6 g l 1 the increase rate became no longer obvious meanwhile the adsorbent capacity decreased significantly as the dosage increased therefore 0 6 g l 1 is a dose that takes into account both efficiency and cost for mb and cr removals 3 2 3 kinetic and isotherm adsorption kinetics was applied to explicate the mass transfer of adsorbates at the solid liquid interface and the adsorptive mechanism the selected kinetic equations were provided in table s2 fig 8a b show the adsorption kinetic data and the fitted parameters are presented in table 3 to compare fig 8a with fig 8b it is observed that the mass transfer processes differed significantly between the two dye molecules in the case of mb it is divided into a fast adsorption stage 0 30 min and a slow equilibrium stage 30 120 min while for cr the adsorptive equilibrium was slowly reached until about 600 min the regression parameters from kinetic data revealed that the pseudo second order pso model met the adsorption of mb better the result suggested that chemisorption dominated the uptake of mb and the adsorption mechanism was considered bonding forces 46 however both the pseudo first order pfo and pso models can be well fitted for cr adsorption indicating the coexistence of chemisorption and physisorption in cr removal 47 moreover pore and intra particle diffusion are often rate limiting in the mass transfer from solution into solid phase 48 it is shown that cr adsorption obeyed intra particle diffusion ipd equation well and the intercept of fitted straight line was near the origin fig s7 table 3 suggesting that the uptake of cr is a process controlled by intra particle diffusion the adsorption of mb could not be fitted by ipd model but involved in two linear stages i e intra particle diffusion and external surface binding suggesting that the intra particle diffusion is not the exclusive rate limiting step 49 fig 8c d display the adsorption isotherms and table 3 lists regression parameters which further revealed the adsorption mechanism the data analysis shows that both langmuir and freundlich models table s2 can well fit the relationship between the adsorption capacity and the equilibrium concentration with the initial dye concentration as a variable however the fittings of redlich peterson equation with the third dimensionless parameter β were better due to the higher correlation coefficient r 2 0 975 0 990 indicating that the solute uptake was monolayer chemisorption in low concentration while it may have adsorbate stacking in high concentration solutions 50 moreover it is found that the monolayer maximum adsorption capacity q m of p tio2 bc to mb and cr exceeded 200 mg g 1 which is higher than the reported values of many biochar based adsorbents 29 41 51 the high specific surface area abundant pore structure and modification of nano tio2 can explain the high adsorption capacity of p tio2 bc 51 3 3 desorption the desorption of mb and cr was eluted with me ac and me solvents respectively fig 9 shows the adsorbed mb and cr can almost completely desorbed at the first run with solvent elution as the number of cycles increases however the desorption efficiency of cr dropped sharply to only about 20 while the desorption efficiency of mb remained above 90 during five runs this result indicates that there is a stronger force between cr and the adsorbent and the uneluted cr molecules would gradually accumulate on the adsorbent notability di water has also been investigated for desorption but the results showed that it can hardly elute the adsorbed dye molecules data not shown desorption ratio 5 in the present work the photo degradation of adsorbed dyes was performed over the solid it is difficult to quantitatively analyze the degraded dyes in the sorbent the adsorbed dye molecules can be completely eluted with me ac or me solvents this provided an indirect way to determine the amount of remaining dye in other words the efficiency of solid phase photo degradation can be quantified by measuring the undegraded dye in the eluate the absorbance test of dye solutions with different concentrations showed the working curve offered a perfect linear relationship r 2 0 999 fig s3 fig 4 3 4 in situ photo degradation of adsorbed dyes the in situ photo degradation of adsorbed dyes was evaluated by directly irradiating the collected adsorbent under visible light fig 10a shows the degradation ratio of mb and cr dyes onto bc and p tio2 bc sorbents over varying time it can be observed that bc has a moderate photo activity to degrade mb and cr dyes 65 and 52 degradation ratio for mb and cr respectively other research and our previous work have adequately demonstrated that the pyrolyzed chars with various surface groups offered photocatalytic activity to degrade aqueous organic pollutant 44 52 54 after tio2 nanoparticles were loaded the enhanced dye degradation degradation ratio 99 is observed to compare with the pristine bc the reactive species such as superoxide free radicals o2 hydroxyl radicals oh and holes h are recognized to oxidatively degrade organic pollutants in semiconductor photocatalysis 27 44 to investigate the effect of these active reactants on the degradation of dye molecules the free radical and holes trapping experiments were carried out the aqueous solution where quencher was dissolved was sprayed on the adsorbent instead of di water to examine its effect on the degradation efficiency isopropanol ipa ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta p benzoquinone pbq were selected as oh h and o2 quenchers respectively 55 and the result is shown in fig 10b the figure exhibits that all three quenchers have inhibited the degradation of mb suggesting that the three active species were present during photocatalysis however the degree of inhibition varied depending on the quenchers when ipa was added into the reaction the photo degradation of mb was distinctly suppressed but the inhibition of edta and pbq was unconspicuous based on the quenching experiments oh radicals played a crucial role in photo degradation process the photo production of oh is considered as eqs 5 10 36 41 45 upon illumination p tio2 bc receives the photon energy and electron hole pairs are generated within tio2 conduction band e cb and valence band h vb eq 5 the photo generated holes can directly react with oh to produce oh radicals according to holes trapping experiment however the depression effect of edta on mb degradation was less than that of ipa and thus oh radicals should also be produced by other means eqs 7 10 give the other ways to generate oh radicals the o2 radicals produced by the reaction of e cb with adsorbed dissolved o2 act with protons to form hydrogen peroxide h2o2 which splits to generate oh radicals the o2 radicals can also further react with h2o2 to generate oh radicals while releasing hydroxide anions and oxygen eq 10 eventually these accumulated reactive free radicals oxidize the dye molecules to cause dye degradation this series of reactions revealed that sufficient oxygen supply was important for photocatalytic oxidative degradation of organic pollutants 27 56 in the solid phase photocatalysis photons can not only reach the catalyst surface directly but the fully exposed air water interface ensured sufficient oxygen and moisture supply 5 p tio 2 bc hv h vb tio

was further confirmed by ers measurement fig 11a shows a symmetric esr signal of p tio2 bc mb at centered 2 004 g factor when the visible light was turned on the signals can be assigned to single electron trapped oxygen vacancies setovs on the surface which is inextricably related to the presence of oxygenated radicals like o2 o and o3 ers has been regularly applied to investigate the initial steps of photocatalytic reactions between the adsorbed molecules and the solid surface 45 56 58 moreover the photo generated electron hole pairs in the bulk must be separated and transferred to surface and captured by surface traps otherwise redox reactions of the adsorbed reactants cannot occur thereon for this the pl performance of p tio2 bc mb was measured to confirm the effective separation of photo generated charge carriers as a comparison the pl spectrum of p tio2 mb was also measured as shown in fig 11b it is distinct that p tio2 bc mb is seized of lower pl curve than p tio2 mb corresponding to a lower recombination of e cb h vb pairs due to the incorporation of hetero structured bc through the covalent bond between p tio2 and bc i e ti o c and ti o p bc can transfer and receive electrons thereby promoting the separation of e cb h vb pairs 41 44 45 59 based on the experimental results and above analysis the graphical presentation of the in situ photo degradation mechanism is displayed in fig 12 briefly upon the visible light irradiation the electrons excited from vb to the intra band 2 53 ev were trapped by setovs leaving holes in vb the holes react with oh to generate oh radicals the trapped electrons react with o2 to produce o2 radicals which further attack h2o resulting in h2o2 h2o2 may disintegrate to produce oh radicals these highly reactive radicals attack dye molecules to degrade them the degradation products may be small molecule intermediates or be thoroughly mineralized into co2 and water including nitrate sulfate etc 60 61 3 5 reusability after the in situ photo degradation was accomplished the recycled p tio2 bc re adsorbed mb dyes to investigate the reusability the comparison experiment was performed on the adsorbents of thermal regeneration and solvent elution regeneration as well as the photo regeneration without water sprayed fig 13 presents the variation of regeneration efficiency for five cycles in the four regeneration modes it is observed that solvent elution me ac is the most effective way of regeneration and the regeneration efficiency in five cycles remains above 82 however solvent elution is a phase transfer regeneration rather than destructive and the toxic dyes still exist in the liquid phase the photo and thermal regeneration can eliminate organic pollutants and fig 13 shows that the efficiency of photo regeneration 88 1 69 3 is significantly better than thermal regeneration 83 1 25 6 the photo regeneration maintained a higher and stable regeneration rate during five cycles moreover xrd and ftir measurements exhibited that phase constituents and surface groups of the recycled p tio2 bc kept basically unchanged under photo regeneration figs s8 s9 the ssa and v total values decreased from 1747 8 to 1343 2 m2 g 1 and from 1 57 to 1 03 cm3 g 1 respectively fig s10 the results show that it is feasible to recover and reuse the adsorbent several times under photo regeneration however it is very important to keep the adsorbent surface wet during the photo regeneration otherwise the regeneration rate will drop sharply from 75 to only 15 after five runs the reason for this may be that the degradation intermediates cannot diffuse in time and form carbon deposits on the surface thereby deactivating the photocatalyst 26 27 62 the exact reason will be studied in depth in next works in general the solid phase photo regeneration is quite a useful regeneration method which not only guaranteed a higher regeneration efficiency in multiple cycles but also maintained relatively stable in the structure surface functional groups and textural properties of the adsorbent 4 conclusion p tio2 bc demonstrated a higher dyes adsorption capacity than bc the adsorption of mb onto p tio2 bc obeyed pso kinetic model and redlich peterson isotherm the q m value of mb was estimated to be 223 4 mg g 1 at 30 c the uptake of cr onto p tio2 bc complied with ipd kinetic model and redlich peterson isotherm the q m value was 208 9 mg g 1 at 30 c mb and cr adsorbed by p tio2 bc can be wholly desorbed by solvent elution with me ac and me respectively importantly the adsorbed dye molecules can be degraded in the solid phase and the wettability of the solid phase is very important to maintain the degradation rate of dye molecules the reactive species of oh and o2 radicals and h were identified to oxidize dyes degradation in which oh radicals played a leading role the adsorbent regenerated by solid phase photocatalysis can be reused several times while maintaining a stable structure and high efficient re adsorption rate this work allows to provide an alternative strategy for sequential combined adsorptive and photocatalytic removal of aqueous organic pollutants in the next work the degradation of contaminants of emerging concern pesticides ppcps etc will be used to examine the effectiveness of this strategy and to understand the mechanism

13174,the rapid increase of swine wastewater sw has posed great threat to the environment and traditional processes also suffered from a high operational cost in this study porous co n co doped carbon derived from tea residue was synthesized through a green low cost method combining the nacl kcl eutectic salt and a little koh as activator at different temperature for microbial fuel cells to treat the sw the catalyst prepared at 700 c tc 700 displayed high specific surface area 1009 5 m2 g and appropriate porous structure high co nx and pyridinic n content which endowed it with good oxygen reduction reaction activity when used in the mfc to treat sw a higher maximum power density 748 9 mw m2 and maximum output voltage 0 529 v was obtained with better stability compared to the pt c

production of swine wastewater is growing rapidly with the population and the economic growth usually high level of organic pollutants which contains abundant energy and abundant heavy metal antibiotics pathogens and nutrient elements n p were all contained in the sw 1 2 many treatment techniques could deal with such wastewater to some extent such as activated sludge process constructed wetland and digestion however they are not only suffering from many disadvantages including high sludge production large area high energy consumption or cost but also failing to recycle the energy from sw efficiently microbial fuel cell mfc which can achieve organics degradation and electricity generation simultaneously in wastewater has been proposed to treat the sw and recover its energy as electricity considering the high concentrations of cod 3 compared to the typical two chamber mfc single chamber mfc smfc with air cathode has attracted more attention for practical application because of its low cost simple construction and good electricity generation capacity 4 5 on the surface of a smfc s cathode o2 is reduced by receiving the electrons from the anode through 2 e or 4 e pathway in which the catalyst plays an important role 6 if its oxygen reduction reaction orr activity were not so well a high overpotential and sluggish orr kinetics would be obtained leading to a poor power output 7 although the commercial pt c has good orr activity limited by its high cost and bad stability it s not the ideal catalyst for the large scale application of smfc 6 transition metal nitrogen co doped carbon m n c m fe co ni has great potential as the pt c catalyst substitute due to its superior orr activity 8 it s generally accepted that the good performance of m n c catalyst is attributed to the m nx sites and pyridinic n where m nx has a strong capacity for chemisorption of oxygen catalyzing the cleavage of oo bonding and reducing o2 to h2o through 4 e and 2 2 e pathway while pyridinic n can also catalyze orr though 2 2 e pathway 9 10 furthermore materials with high porosity are favorable for enhancing its electrocatalytic properties because that the contact area between the active sites and electrolyte can be enlarged 11 thus the synthetic effects of m nx sites pyridinic n and high porosity would greatly improve the orr activity of catalyst directly pyrolyzing the precursor of m n c catalyst may not be conducive to acquiring a high ssa while adding some chemical agents during the preparation can solve this problem yang et al reported a micropores rich fe n co doped material prepared by pyrolyzing the zncl2 and ppy feclx simultaneously displaying good electrocatalytic performance 12 yang et al synthesized the efficient fe n c catalyst for smfcs from solid digestate through introducing k2co3 which obviously increased the ssa and increasing the power output 13 zhou et al reported the mesopores rich fe n co doped carbon hollow nanospheres fe n c nhs 750 synthesized by sio2 template method showing a comparable orr activity to the pt c 14 in spite of good porosity such agents may bring they are toxic to human and corrosive to facilities or costly or complicated in synthesis and not environmentally friendly recently inert inorganic salt such as nacl and kcl are used as activator for 3d porous structure and more importantly they are cheap and green for they can be removed simply by water and recycled through evaporation 15 16 besides with the assistance of eutectic salt melting point will be lower and high porosity and more doped heteroatoms will be also obtained due to capillary action and confining effect 17 18 metal atoms will also become less agglomerated therefore smaller size nanoparticles even single atom active sites may be obtained and more orr m nx sites will be formed when combing a little traditional chemical activator with the salt a high more meso and micropores will be generated while its corrosivity and toxicity can also be minimized by which the mass exchange is accelerated and the additional orr active sites are provided 11 19 20 biochar a green low cost and naturally abundant resource has become a hot research spot because that it can be transformed into n self doped orr catalysts after pyrolysis 13 21 thus compared to extra nitrogen sources such as melamine and thiourea or extra carbon skeletons such as carbon nanotubes or artificial synthetic precursors 12 biochar provides a more harmless low cost and simpler process for heteroatom doped carbon based materials tea as a very popular drink is widely planted in the world especially in china after being brewed a large amount of tea residue rich in n o p f et al is produced thus an excellent biomass precursor for cathode catalyst hitherto despite many catalysts developed for the mfcs limited researches focused on their applications on mfcs for real wastewater treatment especially swine wastewater here porous co n co doped carbon derived from tea residue under different activation temperature were developed for mfcs to treat sw by adding the nacl kcl eutectic salt and a little koh as activator the morphology and microstructure of the catalysts were characterized by sem tem bet xps xrd and raman spectra and the electrocatalytic performance was also evaluated by cv eis tafel and rrde tests furthermore the materials were used in mfcs for real sw treatment and the electricity generation and pollutants removal capacity of those mfcs were also measured finally partial 16s rrna based high throughput sequencing was employed for revealing the microbial communities of tc 700 cathode mfc and elucidating its mechanism of cod nh4 n tn removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of tc catalysts tea was bought from local market after being drunk the residue was dried at 60 c subsequently 10 g dried tea residue was soaked in 500 ml 20 g l cocl2 solution at 70 c for 12 h and then it was washed by a very little water and dried at 70 c then it was ground power and transferred into the koh nacl kcl solution 100 ml 1 g koh 10 g nacl 10 g kcl under magnetic stirring overnight it was then dried at 65 c and the obtained mixture was annealed in a tube furnace under ar protection at 600 700 800 and 900 c for 2 h respectively and the heating rate was 5 c min after naturally cooling the dark product was soak in 500 ml deionized water and then stirred for 12 h to fully dissolve the activator after suck filtration and washing the remained solid was dried and denoted as tc x x 600 700 800 900 in addition samples without co addition ntc and without koh nacl kcl activation cotc were prepared at 700 c as control materials 2 2 mfcs setup and operation the effective volume of each smfc φ3 0 4 0 cm was 20 ml with carbon felt φ2 4 0 3 cm as the anode and carbon cloth φ3 0 cm as cathode both the anode and cathode were soaked in 1 m hcl and 1 m naoh solution for 12 h respectively and then transferred to acetone for another 12 h the gas diffusion layer was fabricated according to previous reports with the catalyst loading of 1 mg cm2 21 to set up the mfcs activated sludge from a sw treatment plant was used as the inoculum and the mixture of synthetic wastewater and sw was used as the influent for several two days until the voltage became stable the composition of the synthetic wastewater is listed in table s1 the sw was from another plants in chongqing and some of its parameters were measured table s2 after completely start up the influent was 100 sw the output voltage of each mfc was recorded by a data acquisition system das piso 813 hongge co ltd taiwan with an external resistance of 1000 ω 2 3 material characterizations the microstructure and surface morphology of the materials was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope quattro s thermo fisher scientific usa and a high resolution transmission electron microscope fei tecnai g2 f20 usa the xrd tests were performed with cukα radiation operated at 45 kv and 40 ma on an x ray diffraction meter bruker d8 advance germany while raman spectroscopy was acquired on a labram hr evolution with a 532 nm excitation wavelength the xps tests were conducted on a thermo scientific k alpha with a mono alkα source at 150 w the n2 adsorption desorption plots were acquired at 77 k with a quadrasorb 2mp adsorption instrument 2 4 analytical methods on mfcs cv eis and tafel plots of the mfcs were acquired from an electrochemical workstation chi 660e chenhua shanghai china with cathode as the working electrode and the bio anode as the count electrode a sce inserted in the chamber as the reference electrode the cv tests were conducted in the potential range of 0 3 v to 0 5 v at the scanning rate of 5 mv s and the eis measurements were performed in the frequency of 100 khz to 0 01 hz with the amplitude of 5 mv under open circle potential ocp tafel plots were obtained by scanning the overpotential range of 0 100 mv at the scanning rate of 1 mv s besides rrde tests in the pbs solution were also performed to reveal the electron transfer number n and h2o2 yield h2o2 according to eqs 1 2 and the details were same as previous report with a few adjustments 11 1 n 4 i d i r n i d 2 h 2 o 2 200 i r n i r n i d where the id and ir were disk current and ring current and n was a constant value n 0 37 the power density curves and polarization curves of the mfcs were obtained by reducing the external resistance from 9000 ω to 10 ω the mfcs were kept open circle for at least 6 h before measuring the output voltage of pt c tc 600 700 800 900 cathode mfc were recorded for several cycles by the data acquisition system when the voltage was less than 50 mv the treated sw was replaced by fresh sw the coulombic efficiency ce was calculated as following equation 3 ce m 0 t b idt fb v net δcod where m represents the molecular weight of o2 m 32 f is faraday s constant f 96 500c mol and b is the

methods the ph was acquired from a portable ph meter hq11d hach usa 2 5 microbial community analysis biofilms collected from anode and cathode of tc 700 cathode mfc were used for microbial community characterization to clarify the functional bacteria for electricity generation and pollutants removal the total genomic dna was extracted and amplified and the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with the primers 338f actcctacgggaggcagcag and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat and subsequently sequenced by the illumina miseq platform 3 results and discussion 3 1 structure and morphology characterizations the pore formation was determined by following mechanisms first at low temperature a large amount of h2o and co2 and volatile organics were spilled in the form of gas due to the pyrolysis of organics resulting in formation of pores second at the middle temperature koh began to react with c and etch the carbon skeleton eqs 4 7 thus contributing to the generation of micropores 22 the solid nacl and kcl can also serve as templates for macropores formation 15 at high temperature the molten nacl kcl would be filled into the pores and channels of the materials through capillarity which was conducive to the generation of mesopores and macropores thus forming a 3d interconnected pore structure 15 18 4 6 koh 2 c 2 k 3 h 2 2 k 2 c o 3 5 k 2 c o 3 k 2 o c o 2 6 c o 2 c 2 co 7 k 2 c o 3 2 c 2 k 3 co the morphology of the materials was first illustrated by sem as shown in the fig 1 a d all of the samples presented dense hole distribution with few nanoparticles dispersed on the surface with the lowest temperature there were large holes and many shallow thin pits on the surface of tc 600 suggesting an insufficient activation with the increase of activation temperature the surface of tc 700 became more and more unsmooth and the interconnected 3d porous structure was generated however tc 800 and tc 900 exhibited more uniform and smaller pores on the surface the morphology of ntc and cotc were displayed in the fig s1 smooth surface with big aggregated particles was observed in the sem image of cotc while ntc had a similar morphology to tc 700 with interconnected pores of different sizes on the surface tem was carried out on the tc 700 to further unveil the microstructure as shown in the fig 1 e the interconnected macropores and mesopores structure with 20 30 nm co nanoparticles encaptured in the carbon skeleton was confirmed and hrtem image fig 1 f showed three well defined lattice fringes which posed the distance of 0 204 nm 0 243 nm and 0 223 nm corresponding to the metallic cobalt 111 plane cobalt oxide 111 plane and co3c 200 plane 10 23 the sem s energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds elemental mapping analysis results fig 1 g i of tc 700 suggested a uniform distribution of elemental carbon oxygen nitrogen and cobalt and the fact that co and n element is evenly dispersed in the selected area implied a successful co n co doping in the porous carbon skeleton the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the materials are shown in the fig 2 tc 600 tc 700 tc 800 and tc 900 and ntc demonstrated a typical integrations of i and iv patterns with type h4 hysteresis loop under medium pressure p p0 0 4 0 9 and slight uptake under high relative pressure p p0 0 9 1 0 suggesting the dominance of microporous structure and the presence of meso macroporous structure 11 the pore size distribution plots fig 2 inner further indicated that micropores and mesopores with different sizes were the main species it s reported that materials with 3d hierarchically porous structure would exhibit excellent orr activity because the synthetic effects of micro meso and macropores could facilitate mass transfer and accessibility of active sites towards orr 13 however the low n2 adsorption desorption quantity of cotc indicated a low ssa which further confirmed the dominant role of koh kcl nacl in pore formation process what s more to further understand the role of the koh addition the isotherm of sample without koh addition at 700 c was shown in the fig s2 the bet surface area was 381 1 m2 g and the type iv isotherm indicated a mesoporous structure 16 suggesting that the nacl kcl are crucial for meso macro porous formation and the little koh addition would extremely enlarge the ssa and promote the hierarchical porous structure the porosity characterization results were further summarized in table 1 even at a low temperature like 600 c a bigger ssa up to 921 0 m2 g was still obtained compared with previous reports using koh 11 or salt only 15 18 with a higher temperature 600 800 c the ssa became lager and more micropores were generated however a decreasing trend was observed at tc 900 which was attributed to collapse on some micropores tc 700 presented a ssa of 1009 5 m2 g and a total pore volume of 0 51 cm3 g including 0 38 cm3 g 73 9 from micropores the hierarchical porous structure would promote the mass transport ability and the exposure of active sites in the electrolyte thus favorable for the enhancement of orr activity the xrd and roman tests were performed to figure out the crystal structure and the graphitization degree as shown in the fig 3 a distinguishable diffraction peaks at 44 4 51 7 and 76 0 the indices of 111 200 and 220 crystal planes of metallic co 10 were observed in all of the samples except for ntc and tc 600 with the increase of activation temperature those peaks became sharper and sharper suggesting that more co 0 was formed it s acknowledged that transition metals fe co ni are effective catalysts for the synthesis of graphitic carbon through the formation of mxc m fe co ni 24 thus the increase of co 0 is also a sign of the appearance of graphitic carbon which can be proved by the weak diffraction peak at 26 in the curves of tc 800 and tc 900 corresponding to the 002 plane of graphite 13 at the same time because the formation of graphitic carbon is usually related to dissolution precipitation mechanism between the metal nanoparticles deposited on the carbon and the surrounding amorphous carbon 25 26 a higher graphitization degree may raise requirements for more and bigger metal nanoparticles which may lead to the co aggregation and a lower co nx content no obvious diffraction peak at 26 in the xrd patterns of tc 700 and cotc were observed which may be attributed to less serious co aggregation and lower activation temperature 27 roman spectra fig 3 b illustrated that there were two clear peaks at 1340 cm 1 d band and 1580 cm 1 d band respectively the d band is usually the characteristic of defect or atoms disorder in the carbon while the g band represents the graphitic phases and a higher id ig degree implies that more defects hole or edge defects structure were formed or more co and n atoms were doped in the carbon skeleton 28 the id ig for tc 600 tc 700 tc 800 tc 900 were 1 04 1 10 1 15 1 13 suggesting that to some extent the increase of activation temperature would be beneficial for defect formation which may be attributed to the evaporation of doped n and the aggregation of co atoms when the temperature was too high graphitization would outcompete the defects generation thus lowering the id ig previous studies have suggested that the defects are functional for h2o2 production through 1 or 2e pathway 29 30 which would lessen the power output thus more doped co and n and less carbon defects are favorable for electricity generation besides the weak 2d peak at 2700 cm 1 in the tc 700 tc 800 and tc 900 can be ascribed to the stacked graphitic carbon layers further confirming the existence of graphite structure 11 21 the id ig for cotc and ntc are 1 02 and 1 08 indicating that more heteroatoms can be doped by synthetic effects of the co and koh nacl kcl while the graphitic structure can also be preserved according to the roman spectra of tc 700 thus both more active sites generation and good conductivity were achieved in the tc 700 xps tests results fig 4 a suggested that c n o and co existed in all of the catalyze except for ntc no obvious peaks for na and k confirmed that they have almost been removed after washing the element contents were listed in the table s3 as can be seen from the xps results higher activation temperature would lead to the decrease of n atoms and co addition could offset this influence to some extent combined the roman spectra the higher id ig of tc 800 and tc 900 may be partly due to the evaporation of doped n leading to the carbon defect formation the high resolution n1s spectrum of tc 700 fig 4 b was deconvoluted into four peaks centered at 398 2 ev 399 4 ev 400 6 ev and 401 8 ev which are assigned to pyridinic n co nx pyrrolic n and graphitic n 31 32 it s reported that pyridinic n co nx were the active sites for orr and especially the latter was most crucial to the improvement of orr activity 33 the graphitic n would contribute to the conductivity of the materials pyrrolic n is an undesirable site responsible for the o2 reduction through 2 e pathway in which h2o2 detrimental to the catalyst would be generated 9 hence a higher percentage of co nx and pyridinic n certain proportion of graphitic n and less pyrrole n are favorable for tc 700 there is 33 17 co nx 46 57 pyridinic n against 12 36 pyrrolic n in the doped n suggesting that more active sites for 4 e orr existed in the material besides as can be seen in the fig s3 a c a higher activation temperature would facilitate the formation of graphitic n but inhabiting others and co addition could help in forming the graphitic n and co nx thus decreasing the amounts of pyrrolic n according to fig s3 d e which would improve the conductivity and electrocatalytic performance similar phenomena have also been reported by the previous studies 13 34 furthermore high resolution co2p1 2 spectrum fig 4 c fig s4 a d further confirmed the existence of metallic co 779 4 ev co ii 781 0 ev and co nx 783 2 ev 10 and the peak at 786 9 ev is satellite peak 17 3 2 electrochemical and catalytic activity analysis because of the complex composition of the real sw it was hard to evaluate the electrochemical properties correctly in the simulated matrix such as pbs solution thus measurements including cv tafel and eis were carried out on the mfcs treating real sw as shown in the fig 5 a although no reduction peaks were observed in all of the cv curves significant oxygen reduction current was observed the area of a cv plot is an index of electrochemical activity and a larger area indicated that more active sites for orr was exposed in the electrolyte thus a faster electron transfer and orr reaction rate 35 36 among the different mfcs the cathode coated with tc 700 showed the largest area with the tc 600 and pt c cathode followed by although n2 adsorption desorption experiment results have shown that tc 800 tc 900 presented larger ssa their cv area was the smallest cv curves of cotc and ntc cathode were displayed in the fig s5 and their cv area was lower than tc 700 cathode too especially the cotc cathode s which resulted from its extremely low ssa besides the highest current density of tc 700 cathode 9 34 a m2 also suggested that it had better electrocatalytic performance than the other modified cathodes 37 tafel plots fig 5 b were also used to study the catalytic performance of different samples and the i0 was obtained from the linear tafel regression r2 0 99 in the overpotential range from 80 mv to 100 mv obviously the i0 can be ordered as following tc 700 pt c tc 600 ntc tc 800 tc 900 cotc tc 700 cathode presented the highest i0 of 0 2434 a cm 2 about 25 7 40 3 50 9 153 6 and 252 9 higher than the pt c tc 600 ntc tc 800 tc 900 and cotc suggesting that tc 700 had a faster charge transfer rate and lower activation energy barrier towards orr 11 36 to further evaluate the orr activity of catalysts acquired from different activation temperature rrde tests were performed under o2 saturated pbs solution the average electron transfer number n for tc 600 tc 700 tc 800 and tc 900 were calculated to be 3 69 3 75 3 73 and 3 61 at the selected area 0 20 0 30 v vs rhe respectively fig s6 indicating that o2 was reduced to h2o mainly through a 4 e pathway tc 700 showing the highest electron transfer number 3 75 and lowest h2o2 yield 12 3 possessed better activity towards orr lsv tests in alkaline condition fig s7 a showed that tc 700 possessed most positive initial potential 0 85 v vs rhe and half wave potential 0 76 v vs rhe stability test fig s7 b based on cv methods in 0 1 m koh solution after 1000 cycles showed little difference with the initial cv and the orr peak 0 72 v vs rhe was only 20 mv negative than the initial and the orr peak was 0 44 ma cm2 initial 0 48 ma cm2 showing little difference this suggested a good chemical stability of tc 700 furthermore eis was employed to characterize the total resistance among the different samples and the nyquist plots was displayed in fig 5 c cotc showed the lowest total resistance of 14 90 ω followed by tc 700 17 70 ω tc 800 19 31 ω tc 900 20 17 ω ntc 23 25 ω pt c 24 35 ω and tc 600 29 34 ω however tc 700 presented the largest slope of straight line in the low frequency region suggesting its superior in ion electron transportation 38 the total resistance is mainly determined by charge transfer ability mass transfer ability and the conductivity of the electrolyte 39 usually the last one is similar because there was no distinction in the operating environments hence the difference mainly comes from the former two for cotc its lowest resistance could be attributed to the higher graphitization degree and graphitic n which endowed it good with conductivity and its highest density mass volume ratio which caused extremely thin catalytic layer on the carbon cloth and lowered the resistance from mass transport combined the structure characterization results the higher electrochemical activity of tc 700 cathode can be attributed to these reasons 1 higher co nx and pyridinic n content in the carbon skeleton which can catalyze the cleavage of oo bonding and reduce o2 to h2o through 4 e or 2 2 e pathway efficiently are crucial for improved orr activity 40 41 2 hierarchical porous structure with abundant micro meso and macropores would endow it with good mass exchange ability and active sites accessibility 3 the graphitic carbon graphitic n co3c and metallic co could also strengthen the conductivity for tc 800 and tc 900 although their displayed a larger ssa and graphitic structure the higher activation temperature would lead to more serious evaporation of n and aggregation of co atoms thus decreasing the amount of the most crucial active sites co nx and forming more hole or edge defects which could catalyze the reduction of o2 to h2o2 through 1 e or 2 e pathway 29 besides as sem images fig 1 a d shown tc 800 and tc 900 displayed thinner pores on the surface which may be blocked more easily by the microorganisms thus lowering the mass transfer ability consequently their orr performance was not so good as tc 700 as for tc 600 due to lower ssa and less micropores than tc and higher pyrrolic n content the orr activity was also not desirable besides its high resistance can also be attributed to the scarcity of graphite structure and graphitic n electrochemical characterizations on the cotc confirmed that hierarchical porous structure and high ssa are necessary for ntc in spite of similar pore structure lack of co addition caused its poor orr performance and high resistance which was derived from the deficiency of co nx sites and graphite structure 3 3 performance of mfcs treating the swine wastewater to further evaluate the power generation and pollutants removal capacity of the mfcs equipped with different catalyzers the mfcs treating real swine wastewater were kept operating for many cycles the power density and polarization curves of these mfcs are displayed in the fig 6 a mfc with tc 700 obtained a maximum power density of 749 8 mw m2 which was 27 4 56 0 83 7 113 1 201 0 and 342 4 higher than that of pt c cathode mfc 588 7 mw m2 tc 600 cathode mfc 480 6 mw m2 ntc cathode mfc 408 mw m2 tc 800 cathode mfc 351 9 mw m2 tc 900 cathode mfc 249 1 mw m2 and cotc cathode mfc 169 0 mw m2 in addition the open circuit voltage of tc 700 cathode mfc was higher than other mfcs except for pt c cathode mfc and it also displayed a minimum slope according to the polarization curves these results illustrated that tc 700 cathode mfc had lower inner resistance and better power output capacity which was mainly derived from the higher kinetic rates of cathode orr then the polarization curves of anodes and cathodes were also measured fig 6 b there was little difference among the curves of anodes while those of the cathodes showed similar trends to the power density and polarization curves thus the electricity production difference among the mfcs was mainly attributed to the different cathode catalysts moreover the potential of tc 700 cathode was more positive and the slope was also gentler this was because that tc 700 has a higher co nx and pyridinic n content and appropriate pore structure which endowed it with good orr activity mass transfer capacity and less resistance after 20 days start up and operation electricity generation from swine wastewater could be achieved by the mfcs and the output voltage has been stable the output voltage at 1000 ω of mfcs with tc x x 600 700 800 900 and pt c was then recorded for several cycles and shown in fig 6 c consistent with the former results tc 700 cathode mfc obtained the maximum voltage of 0 529 v at the beginning during the recording period slightly higher than pt c cathode mfc 0 513 v and obviously higher than tc 600 cathode mfc 0 478 v tc 800 cathode mfc 0 435 v and tc 900 cathode mfc 0 337 v suggesting its good orr activity in the real swine wastewater because of a higher co nx and pyridinic n content electron transfer between the o2 and electrode was accelerated moreover the appropriate pore structure with high ssa and uneven surface endow it with good active sites accessibility in spite of the biofouling resulting in a lower diffusion resistance rd and higher voltage output the encaptured co nanoparticles and co3c graphitic carbon and graphitic n also played important roles in accelerating electron transfer and improving the conductivity thus decreasing the charge transfer resistance rct all of the above points contributed a higher output voltage after several cycles of operation little decrease was observed in the curve of tc 700 cathode mfc while the pt c cathode mfc displayed an obvious deterioration on output voltage and its voltage was always lower due to the synthetic effect of biofouling and pt poisoning 21 37 this demonstrated that tc 700 had good operational stability which was crucial for its application in mfcs to treat the real wastewater the cod removal of tc 700 cathode mfc was 81 8 1 57 fig 6 d tc 800 cathode mfc showed the highest removal of 82 92 2 63 while pt c cathode mfc the lowest removal of 78 45 1 57 however there was an obvious difference in the ce pt c cathode mfc obtained a highest ce of 6 6 0 43 slightly higher than the tc 700 cathode mfc 6 18 0 38 and tc 600 cathode mfc 6 25 0 3 tc 800 cathode mfc shown the lowest ce of 5 72 0 02 besides other parameters of the effluent were also measured as shown in the fig 6 e all of the mfcs had little removal effect on total phosphorus data not shown however those mfcs displayed a good capacity for nh4 n and tn removal the removal rate for tc 700 cathode mfc was 35 0 2 0 for nh4 n and 33 5 2 4 for tn higher than tc 600 cathode mfc and pt c cathode mfc those results further demonstrated the potential of tc 700 when used in a mfc for real sw treatment the ph of the effluent was all above 8 0 suggesting the sufficient alkalinity and good buffer capacity in the sw which was crucial for the stability and activity of m n c catalyst too finally the performance of tc 700 cathode mfc was also compared to other studies table 2 the power output of tc 700 cathode mfc is comparable to or a little better than that from pt c or reported catalyst even though artificial wastewater was used and obviously higher than that with swine wastewater however the ce of this study was far lower than that with artificial wastewater which may be because that organic compounds in sw were complex macromolecules such as protein polysaccharide needing further degradation for exoelectrogens and competitive bacteria especially methanogens denitrifier and desulfurizer would also consumed much cod perhaps that s why the tn was decreased 3 4 microbial community analysis for tc 700 cathode mfc microbial communities of the anode and cathode at different levels were determined to further understand the mechanisms of pollutants removal and electricity generation at the phylum level fig s8 a 15 phyla were found to on the electrode biofilms and 7 and 10 phyla were dominant 1 at the anode and cathode biofilm respectively the phyla of firmicutes 29 35 proteobacteria 21 42 bacteroidota 19 62 desulfobacterota 11 32 synergistota 8 07 actinobacteriota 6 16 were most dominant in the anode biofilm among which proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteriota were related to electricity generation 45 in addition the richness of bacteroidota was also reported by many reports which could also contribute to the improvement of mfc s power output and the long time stability and may relate to nitrogen removal 46 47 another dominant phylum desulfobacterota was responsible for sulfate reduction and related fermentation according to previous report 48 the phylum synergistotas is the typical acetogen which has the ability to decompose organic matter into acetate 49 most of those phyla were also discovered in the cathode biofilm their abundance and mutualism may be an important factor for mfc to acquire high electricity production and remove the pollutants from sw efficiently at the class level fig s8 b 15 dominant classes 1 were identified in the biofilm of anode and cathode the relative abundance of bacteroidia clostridia gammaproteobacteria synergistia actinobacteria bacilli alphaproteobacteria were 19 53 22 63 15 02 8 07 3 65 2 66 6 41 9 97 in the anode biofilm and 28 31 17 38 5 21 9 42 12 35 8 73 3 76 in the cathode biofilm the class of clostridia was reported to be capable of transforming organics to volatile fatty acids vfs while the class of bacteroidia was related to the metabolism of amino acids and converted them to acetate ultimately 50 besides some of actinobacteria in the cathode biofilm 12 35 was identified for dissimilatory metal reduction and denitrification which may be capable of receiving electrons from the cathode for nox n x 2 3 reduction 51 the α and γ proteobacteria known as the typical electroactive bacteria eab may be responsible for extracellular electron transfer eet 52 53 and their existence in the cathode biofilm would also facilitate the electroreduction of nox n but competing with the orr on the catalyst for electrons finally the microbial communities at genus level were illustrated by the heatmap in fig s8 c and there were 60 genera identified with a total relative abundance 0 5 at the two biofilms there was a little difference between the structures which may be attributed to the specific function and the surface properties of the electrodes at the anode biofilm typical eab such as lentimicrobium 4 89 acinetobacter 4 65 rhodopseudomonas 4 57 pseudomonas 2 73 comamonas 0 61 were found in greater abundance than the cathode 45 54 55 for example lentimicrobium belong to the lentimicrobiaceae family was reported to be capable of regulating the indirect eet through their electron dense extracellular polymeric substances 54 while acinetobacter could transfer electrons through secreting an unidentified endogenous compound 55 in addition genus such as rhodopseudomonas pseudomonas were related to bioelectricity generation and sulfate reducing or nitrogen removal 45 56 besides some heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria such as advenella petrimonas were also found richer in anode biofilm 57 58 while some autotrophic denitrifiers such as thiobacillus paracoccus capable of cathode denitrification were discovered more in cathode biofilm 59 considering the complexity of sw composition there must be a lot of unidentified microorganisms that played important roles in the functions of mfc such as electricity generation and nitrogen removal but the anode biofilm must cover the main functions of mfc based on the above analysis if pollutants removal such as nitrogen and organics were conducted on the cathode biofilm the competition on electron and o2 between the catalyst and microorganisms was inevitable consequently the power output may deteriorate 4 conclusion in summary cheap tea residue was used to synthesize porous co n codoped carbon for mfc cathode through a green and sustainable mode of combining the nacl kcl eutectic salt and a little koh as the activator the as prepared tc 700 catalyst displayed high orr performance due to its high specific surface area 1009 5 m2 g and appropriate porous structure high co nx and pyridinic n content the tc 700 cathode mfc presented a high maximum power density 748 9 mw m2 and maximum output voltage 0 529 v with good stability when treating the real sw the pollutants removal capacity and energy recovery ability from sw of the mfc were also in high level microbial community analysis showed that lentimicrobium acinetobacter rhodopseudomonas pseudomonas comamonas were the dominant genus for electricity generation and denitrifiers such as advenella petrimonas played an important role in nitrogen removal this work focused on the development of low cost and efficient mfc cathode catalyst and its application in the real sw which may contribute to the practical application of mfc in sw treatment credit authorship contribution statement hongyi zhu conceptualization writing original draft writing review editing zhi zhang

13174,the rapid increase of swine wastewater sw has posed great threat to the environment and traditional processes also suffered from a high operational cost in this study porous co n co doped carbon derived from tea residue was synthesized through a green low cost method combining the nacl kcl eutectic salt and a little koh as activator at different temperature for microbial fuel cells to treat the sw the catalyst prepared at 700 c tc 700 displayed high specific surface area 1009 5 m2 g and appropriate porous structure high co nx and pyridinic n content which endowed it with good oxygen reduction reaction activity when used in the mfc to treat sw a higher maximum power density 748 9 mw m2 and maximum output voltage 0 529 v was obtained with better stability compared to the pt c cathode mfc 588 7 mw m2 and 0 513 v besides it can also achieve high coulombic efficiency of 6 18 0 38 chemical oxygen demand removal of 81 8 1 86 and ammonia removal of 35 0 2 0 total nitrogen

production of swine wastewater is growing rapidly with the population and the economic growth usually high level of organic pollutants which contains abundant energy and abundant heavy metal antibiotics pathogens and nutrient elements n p were all contained in the sw 1 2 many treatment techniques could deal with such wastewater to some extent such as activated sludge process constructed wetland and digestion however they are not only suffering from many disadvantages including high sludge production large area high energy consumption or cost but also failing to recycle the energy from sw efficiently microbial fuel cell mfc which can achieve organics degradation and electricity generation simultaneously in wastewater has been proposed to treat the sw and recover its energy as electricity considering the high concentrations of cod 3 compared to the typical two chamber mfc single chamber mfc smfc with air cathode has attracted more attention for practical application because of its low cost simple construction and good electricity generation capacity 4 5 on the surface of a smfc s cathode o2 is reduced by receiving the electrons from the anode through 2 e or 4 e pathway in which the catalyst plays an important role 6 if its oxygen reduction reaction orr activity were not so well a high overpotential and sluggish orr kinetics would be obtained leading to a poor power output 7 although the commercial pt c has good orr activity limited by its high cost and bad stability it s not the ideal catalyst for the large scale application of smfc 6 transition metal nitrogen co doped carbon m n c m fe co ni has great potential as the pt c catalyst substitute due to its superior orr activity 8 it s generally accepted that the good performance of m n c catalyst is attributed to the m nx sites and pyridinic n where m nx has a strong capacity for chemisorption of oxygen catalyzing the cleavage of oo bonding and reducing o2 to h2o through 4 e and 2 2 e pathway while pyridinic n can also catalyze orr though 2 2 e pathway 9 10 furthermore materials with high porosity are favorable for enhancing its electrocatalytic properties because that the contact area between the active sites and electrolyte can be enlarged 11 thus the synthetic effects of m nx sites pyridinic n and high porosity would greatly improve the orr activity of catalyst directly pyrolyzing the precursor of m n c catalyst may not be conducive to acquiring a high ssa while adding some chemical agents during the preparation can solve this problem yang et al reported a micropores rich fe n co doped material prepared by pyrolyzing the zncl2 and ppy feclx simultaneously displaying good electrocatalytic performance 12 yang et al synthesized the efficient fe n c catalyst for smfcs from solid digestate through introducing k2co3 which obviously increased the ssa and increasing the power output 13 zhou et al reported the mesopores rich fe n co doped carbon hollow nanospheres fe n c nhs 750 synthesized by sio2 template method showing a comparable orr activity to the pt c 14 in spite of good porosity such agents may bring they are toxic to human and corrosive to facilities or costly or complicated in synthesis and not environmentally friendly recently inert inorganic salt such as nacl and kcl are used as activator for 3d porous structure and more importantly they are cheap and green for they can be removed simply by water and recycled through evaporation 15 16 besides with the assistance of eutectic salt melting point will be lower and high porosity and more doped heteroatoms will be also obtained due to capillary action and confining effect 17 18 metal atoms will also become less agglomerated therefore smaller size nanoparticles even single atom active sites may be obtained and more orr m nx sites will be formed when combing a little traditional chemical activator with the salt a high more meso and micropores will be generated while its corrosivity and toxicity can also be minimized by which the mass exchange is accelerated and the additional orr active sites are provided 11 19 20 biochar a green low cost and naturally abundant resource has become a hot research spot because that it can be transformed into n self doped orr catalysts after pyrolysis 13 21 thus compared to extra nitrogen sources such as melamine and thiourea or extra carbon skeletons such as carbon nanotubes or artificial synthetic precursors 12 biochar provides a more harmless low cost and simpler process for heteroatom doped carbon based materials tea as a very popular drink is widely planted in the world especially in china after being brewed a large amount of tea residue rich in n o p f et al is produced thus an excellent biomass precursor for cathode catalyst hitherto despite many catalysts developed for the mfcs limited researches focused on their applications on mfcs for real wastewater treatment especially swine wastewater here porous co n co doped carbon derived from tea residue under different activation temperature were developed for mfcs to treat sw by adding the nacl kcl eutectic salt and a little koh as activator the morphology and microstructure of the catalysts were characterized by sem tem bet xps xrd and raman spectra and the electrocatalytic performance was also evaluated by cv eis tafel and rrde tests furthermore the materials were used in mfcs for real sw treatment and the electricity generation and pollutants removal capacity of those mfcs were also measured finally partial 16s rrna based high throughput sequencing was employed for revealing the microbial communities of tc 700 cathode mfc and elucidating its mechanism of cod nh4 n tn removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of tc catalysts tea was bought from local market after being drunk the residue was dried at 60 c subsequently 10 g dried tea residue was soaked in 500 ml 20 g l cocl2 solution at 70 c for 12 h and then it was washed by a very little water and dried at 70 c then it was ground power and transferred into the koh nacl kcl solution 100 ml 1 g koh 10 g nacl 10 g kcl under magnetic stirring overnight it was then dried at 65 c and the obtained mixture was annealed in a tube furnace under ar protection at 600 700 800 and 900 c for 2 h respectively and the heating rate was 5 c min after naturally cooling the dark product was soak in 500 ml deionized water and then stirred for 12 h to fully dissolve the activator after suck filtration and washing the remained solid was dried and denoted as tc x x 600 700 800 900 in addition samples without co addition ntc and without koh nacl kcl activation cotc were prepared at 700 c as control materials 2 2 mfcs setup and operation the effective volume of each smfc φ3 0 4 0 cm was 20 ml with carbon felt φ2 4 0 3 cm as the anode and carbon cloth φ3 0 cm as cathode both the anode and cathode were soaked in 1 m hcl and 1 m naoh solution for 12 h respectively and then transferred to acetone for another 12 h the gas diffusion layer was fabricated according to previous reports with the catalyst loading of 1 mg cm2 21 to set up the mfcs activated sludge from a sw treatment plant was used as the inoculum and the mixture of synthetic wastewater and sw was used as the influent for several two days until the voltage became stable the composition of the synthetic wastewater is listed in table s1 the sw was from another plants in chongqing and some of its parameters were measured table s2 after completely start up the influent was 100 sw the output voltage of each mfc was recorded by a data acquisition system das piso 813 hongge co ltd taiwan with an external resistance of 1000 ω 2 3 material characterizations the microstructure and surface morphology of the materials was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope quattro s thermo fisher scientific usa and a high resolution transmission electron microscope fei tecnai g2 f20 usa the xrd tests were performed with cukα radiation operated at 45 kv and 40 ma on an x ray diffraction meter bruker d8 advance germany while raman spectroscopy was acquired on a labram hr evolution with a 532 nm excitation wavelength the xps tests were conducted on a thermo scientific k alpha with a mono alkα source at 150 w the n2 adsorption desorption plots were acquired at 77 k with a quadrasorb 2mp adsorption instrument 2 4 analytical methods on mfcs cv eis and tafel plots of the mfcs were acquired from an electrochemical workstation chi 660e chenhua shanghai china with cathode as the working electrode and the bio anode as the count electrode a sce inserted in the chamber as the reference electrode the cv tests were conducted in the potential range of 0 3 v to 0 5 v at the scanning rate of 5 mv s and the eis measurements were performed in the frequency of 100 khz to 0 01 hz with the amplitude of 5 mv under open circle potential ocp tafel plots were obtained by scanning the overpotential range of 0 100 mv at the scanning rate of 1 mv s besides rrde tests in the pbs solution were also performed to reveal the electron transfer number n and h2o2 yield h2o2 according to eqs 1 2 and the details were same as previous report with a few adjustments 11 1 n 4 i d i r n i d 2 h 2 o 2 200 i r n i r n i d where the id and ir were disk current and ring current and n was a constant value n 0 37 the power density curves and polarization curves of the mfcs were obtained by reducing the external resistance from 9000 ω to 10 ω the mfcs were kept open circle for at least 6 h before measuring the output voltage of pt c tc 600 700 800 900 cathode mfc were recorded for several cycles by the data acquisition system when the voltage was less than 50 mv the treated sw was replaced by fresh sw the coulombic efficiency ce was calculated as following equation 3 ce m 0 t b idt fb v net δcod where m represents the molecular weight of o2 m 32 f is faraday s constant f 96 500c mol and b is the electron transfers number per mole of o2 when it is reduced b 4 v net represents the net volume of each mfc v net 20 ml while δcod represents the cod change within one cycle the cod of the influent and effluent were measured with a portable spectrophotometer according to manufacturer s procedure drb2800 dr 5000 hach company usa concentration of nh4 n tn and tp were measured according to standard methods the ph was acquired from a portable ph meter hq11d hach usa 2 5 microbial community analysis biofilms collected from anode and cathode of tc 700 cathode mfc were used for microbial community characterization to clarify the functional bacteria for electricity generation and pollutants removal the total genomic dna was extracted and amplified and the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with the primers 338f actcctacgggaggcagcag and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat and subsequently sequenced by the illumina miseq platform 3 results and discussion 3 1 structure and morphology characterizations the pore formation was determined by following mechanisms first at low temperature a large amount of h2o and co2 and volatile organics were spilled in the form of gas due to the pyrolysis of organics resulting in formation of pores second at the middle temperature koh began to react with c and etch the carbon skeleton eqs 4 7 thus contributing to the generation of micropores 22 the solid nacl and kcl can also serve as templates for macropores formation 15 at high temperature the molten nacl kcl would be filled into the pores and channels of the materials through capillarity which was conducive to the generation of mesopores and macropores thus forming a 3d interconnected pore structure 15 18 4 6 koh 2 c 2 k 3 h 2 2 k 2 c o 3 5 k 2 c o 3 k 2 o c o 2 6 c o 2 c 2 co 7 k 2 c o 3 2 c 2 k 3 co the morphology of the materials was first illustrated by sem as shown in the fig 1 a d all of the samples presented dense hole distribution with few nanoparticles dispersed on the surface with the lowest temperature there were large holes and many shallow thin pits on the surface of tc 600 suggesting an insufficient activation with the increase of activation temperature the surface of tc 700 became more and more unsmooth and the interconnected 3d porous structure was generated however tc 800 and tc 900 exhibited more uniform and smaller pores on the surface the morphology of ntc and cotc were displayed in the fig s1 smooth surface with big aggregated particles was observed in the sem image of cotc while ntc had a similar morphology to tc 700 with interconnected pores of different sizes on the surface tem was carried out on the tc 700 to further unveil the microstructure as shown in the fig 1 e the interconnected macropores and mesopores structure with 20 30 nm co nanoparticles encaptured in the carbon skeleton was confirmed and hrtem image fig 1 f showed three well defined lattice fringes which posed the distance of 0 204 nm 0 243 nm and 0 223 nm corresponding to the metallic cobalt 111 plane cobalt oxide 111 plane and co3c 200 plane 10 23 the sem s energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds elemental mapping analysis results fig 1 g i of tc 700 suggested a uniform distribution of elemental carbon oxygen nitrogen and cobalt and the fact that co and n element is evenly dispersed in the selected area implied a successful co n co doping in the porous carbon skeleton the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the materials are shown in the fig 2 tc 600 tc 700 tc 800 and tc 900 and ntc demonstrated a typical integrations of i and iv patterns with type h4 hysteresis loop under medium pressure p p0 0 4 0 9 and slight uptake under high relative pressure p p0 0 9 1 0 suggesting the dominance of microporous structure and the presence of meso macroporous structure 11 the pore size distribution plots fig 2 inner further indicated that micropores and mesopores with different sizes were the main species it s reported that materials with 3d hierarchically porous structure would exhibit excellent orr activity because the synthetic effects of micro meso and macropores could facilitate mass transfer and accessibility of active sites towards orr 13 however the low n2 adsorption desorption quantity of cotc indicated a low ssa which further confirmed the dominant role of koh kcl nacl in pore formation process what s more to further understand the role of the koh addition the isotherm of sample without koh addition at 700 c was shown in the fig s2 the bet surface area was 381 1 m2 g and the type iv isotherm indicated a mesoporous structure 16 suggesting that the nacl kcl are crucial for meso macro porous formation and the little koh addition would extremely enlarge the ssa and promote the hierarchical porous structure the porosity characterization results were further summarized in table 1 even at a low temperature like 600 c a bigger ssa up to 921 0 m2 g was still obtained compared with previous reports using koh 11 or salt only 15 18 with a higher temperature 600 800 c the ssa became lager and more micropores were generated however a decreasing trend was observed at tc 900 which was attributed to collapse on some micropores tc 700 presented a ssa of 1009 5 m2 g and a total pore volume of 0 51 cm3 g including 0 38 cm3 g 73 9 from micropores the hierarchical porous structure would promote the mass transport ability and the exposure of active sites in the electrolyte thus favorable for the enhancement of orr activity the xrd and roman tests were performed to figure out the crystal structure and the graphitization degree as shown in the fig 3 a distinguishable diffraction peaks at 44 4 51 7 and 76 0 the indices of 111 200 and 220 crystal planes of metallic co 10 were observed in all of the samples except for ntc and tc 600 with the increase of activation temperature those peaks became sharper and sharper suggesting that more co 0 was formed it s acknowledged that transition metals fe co ni are effective catalysts for the synthesis of graphitic carbon through the formation of mxc m fe co ni 24 thus the increase of co 0 is also a sign of the appearance of graphitic carbon which can be proved by the weak diffraction peak at 26 in the curves of tc 800 and tc 900 corresponding to the 002 plane of graphite 13 at the same time because the formation of graphitic carbon is usually related to dissolution precipitation mechanism between the metal nanoparticles deposited on the carbon and the surrounding amorphous carbon 25 26 a higher graphitization degree may raise requirements for more and bigger metal nanoparticles which may lead to the co aggregation and a lower co nx content no obvious diffraction peak at 26 in the xrd patterns of tc 700 and cotc were observed which may be attributed to less serious co aggregation and lower activation temperature 27 roman spectra fig 3 b illustrated that there were two clear peaks at 1340 cm 1 d band and 1580 cm 1 d band respectively the d band is usually the characteristic of defect or atoms disorder in the carbon while the g band represents the graphitic phases and a higher id ig degree implies that more defects hole or edge defects structure were formed or more co and n atoms were doped in the carbon skeleton 28 the id ig for tc 600 tc 700 tc 800 tc 900 were 1 04 1 10 1 15 1 13 suggesting that to some extent the increase of activation temperature would be beneficial for defect formation which may be attributed to the evaporation of doped n and the aggregation of co atoms when the temperature was too high graphitization would outcompete the defects generation thus lowering the id ig previous studies have suggested that the defects are functional for h2o2 production through 1 or 2e pathway 29 30 which would lessen the power output thus more doped co and n and less carbon defects are favorable for electricity generation besides the weak 2d peak at 2700 cm 1 in the tc 700 tc 800 and tc 900 can be ascribed to the stacked graphitic carbon layers further confirming the existence of graphite structure 11 21 the id ig for cotc and ntc are 1 02 and 1 08 indicating that more heteroatoms can be doped by synthetic effects of the co and koh nacl kcl while the graphitic structure can also be preserved according to the roman spectra of tc 700 thus both more active sites generation and good conductivity were achieved in the tc 700 xps tests results fig 4 a suggested that c n o and co existed in all of the catalyze except for ntc no obvious peaks for na and k confirmed that they have almost been removed after washing the element contents were listed in the table s3 as can be seen from the xps results higher activation temperature would lead to the decrease of n atoms and co addition could offset this influence to some extent combined the roman spectra the higher id ig of tc 800 and tc 900 may be partly due to the evaporation of doped n leading to the carbon defect formation the high resolution n1s spectrum of tc 700 fig 4 b was deconvoluted into four peaks centered at 398 2 ev 399 4 ev 400 6 ev and 401 8 ev which are assigned to pyridinic n co nx pyrrolic n and graphitic n 31 32 it s reported that pyridinic n co nx were the active sites for orr and especially the latter was most crucial to the improvement of orr activity 33 the graphitic n would contribute to the conductivity of the materials pyrrolic n is an undesirable site responsible for the o2 reduction through 2 e pathway in which h2o2 detrimental to the catalyst would be generated 9 hence a higher percentage of co nx and pyridinic n certain proportion of graphitic n and less pyrrole n are favorable for tc 700 there is 33 17 co nx 46 57 pyridinic n against 12 36 pyrrolic n in the doped n suggesting that more active sites for 4 e orr existed in the material besides as can be seen in the fig s3 a c a higher activation temperature would facilitate the formation of graphitic n but inhabiting others and co addition could help in forming the graphitic n and co nx thus decreasing the amounts of pyrrolic n according to fig s3 d e which would improve the conductivity and electrocatalytic performance similar phenomena have also been reported by the previous studies 13 34 furthermore high resolution co2p1 2 spectrum fig 4 c fig s4 a d further confirmed the existence of metallic co 779 4 ev co ii 781 0 ev and co nx 783 2 ev 10 and the peak at 786 9 ev is satellite peak 17 3 2 electrochemical and catalytic activity analysis because of the complex composition of the real sw it was hard to evaluate the electrochemical properties correctly in the simulated matrix such as pbs solution thus measurements including cv tafel and eis were carried out on the mfcs treating real sw as shown in the fig 5 a although no reduction peaks were observed in all of the cv curves significant oxygen reduction current was observed the area of a cv plot is an index of electrochemical activity and a larger area indicated that more active sites for orr was exposed in the electrolyte thus a faster electron transfer and orr reaction rate 35 36 among the different mfcs the cathode coated with tc 700 showed the largest area with the tc 600 and pt c cathode followed by although n2 adsorption desorption experiment results have shown that tc 800 tc 900 presented larger ssa their cv area was the smallest cv curves of cotc and ntc cathode were displayed in the fig s5 and their cv area was lower than tc 700 cathode too especially the cotc cathode s which resulted from its extremely low ssa besides the highest current density of tc 700 cathode 9 34 a m2 also suggested that it had better electrocatalytic performance than the other modified cathodes 37 tafel plots fig 5 b were also used to study the catalytic performance of different samples and the i0 was obtained from the linear tafel regression r2 0 99 in the overpotential range from 80 mv to 100 mv obviously the i0 can be ordered as following tc 700 pt c tc 600 ntc tc 800 tc 900 cotc tc 700 cathode presented the highest i0 of 0 2434 a cm 2 about 25 7 40 3 50 9 153 6 and 252 9 higher than the pt c tc 600 ntc tc 800 tc 900 and cotc suggesting that tc 700 had a faster charge transfer rate and lower activation energy barrier towards orr 11 36 to further evaluate the orr activity of catalysts acquired from different activation temperature rrde tests were performed under o2 saturated pbs solution the average electron transfer number n for tc 600 tc 700 tc 800 and tc 900 were calculated to be 3 69 3 75 3 73 and 3 61 at the selected area 0 20 0 30 v vs rhe respectively fig s6 indicating that o2 was reduced to h2o mainly through a 4 e pathway tc 700 showing the highest electron transfer number 3 75 and lowest h2o2 yield 12 3 possessed better activity towards orr lsv tests in alkaline condition fig s7 a showed that tc 700 possessed most positive initial potential 0 85 v vs rhe and half wave potential 0 76 v vs rhe stability test fig s7 b based on cv methods in 0 1 m koh solution after 1000 cycles showed little difference with the initial cv and the orr peak 0 72 v vs rhe was only 20 mv negative than the initial and the orr peak was 0 44 ma cm2 initial 0 48 ma cm2 showing little difference this suggested a good chemical stability of tc 700 furthermore eis was employed to characterize the total resistance among the different samples and the nyquist plots was displayed in fig 5 c cotc showed the lowest total resistance of 14 90 ω followed by tc 700 17 70 ω tc 800 19 31 ω tc 900 20 17 ω ntc 23 25 ω pt c 24 35 ω and tc 600 29 34 ω however tc 700 presented the largest slope of straight line in the low frequency region suggesting its superior in ion electron transportation 38 the total resistance is mainly determined by charge transfer ability mass transfer ability and the conductivity of the electrolyte 39 usually the last one is similar because there was no distinction in the operating environments hence the difference mainly comes from the former two for cotc its lowest resistance could be attributed to the higher graphitization degree and graphitic n which endowed it good with conductivity and its highest density mass volume ratio which caused extremely thin catalytic layer on the carbon cloth and lowered the resistance from mass transport combined the structure characterization results the higher electrochemical activity of tc 700 cathode can be attributed to these reasons 1 higher co nx and pyridinic n content in the carbon skeleton which can catalyze the cleavage of oo bonding and reduce o2 to h2o through 4 e or 2 2 e pathway efficiently are crucial for improved orr activity 40 41 2 hierarchical porous structure with abundant micro meso and macropores would endow it with good mass exchange ability and active sites accessibility 3 the graphitic carbon graphitic n co3c and metallic co could also strengthen the conductivity for tc 800 and tc 900 although their displayed a larger ssa and graphitic structure the higher activation temperature would lead to more serious evaporation of n and aggregation of co atoms thus decreasing the amount of the most crucial active sites co nx and forming more hole or edge defects which could catalyze the reduction of o2 to h2o2 through 1 e or 2 e pathway 29 besides as sem images fig 1 a d shown tc 800 and tc 900 displayed thinner pores on the surface which may be blocked more easily by the microorganisms thus lowering the mass transfer ability consequently their orr performance was not so good as tc 700 as for tc 600 due to lower ssa and less micropores than tc and higher pyrrolic n content the orr activity was also not desirable besides its high resistance can also be attributed to the scarcity of graphite structure and graphitic n electrochemical characterizations on the cotc confirmed that hierarchical porous structure and high ssa are necessary for ntc in spite of similar pore structure lack of co addition caused its poor orr performance and high resistance which was derived from the deficiency of co nx sites and graphite structure 3 3 performance of mfcs treating the swine wastewater to further evaluate the power generation and pollutants removal capacity of the mfcs equipped with different catalyzers the mfcs treating real swine wastewater were kept operating for many cycles the power density and polarization curves of these mfcs are displayed in the fig 6 a mfc with tc 700 obtained a maximum power density of 749 8 mw m2 which was 27 4 56 0 83 7 113 1 201 0 and 342 4 higher than that of pt c cathode mfc 588 7 mw m2 tc 600 cathode mfc 480 6 mw m2 ntc cathode mfc 408 mw m2 tc 800 cathode mfc 351 9 mw m2 tc 900 cathode mfc 249 1 mw m2 and cotc cathode mfc 169 0 mw m2 in addition the open circuit voltage of tc 700 cathode mfc was higher than other mfcs except for pt c cathode mfc and it also displayed a minimum slope according to the polarization curves these results illustrated that tc 700 cathode mfc had lower inner resistance and better power output capacity which was mainly derived from the higher kinetic rates of cathode orr then the polarization curves of anodes and cathodes were also measured fig 6 b there was little difference among the curves of anodes while those of the cathodes showed similar trends to the power density and polarization curves thus the electricity production difference among the mfcs was mainly attributed to the different cathode catalysts moreover the potential of tc 700 cathode was more positive and the slope was also gentler this was because that tc 700 has a higher co nx and pyridinic n content and appropriate pore structure which endowed it with good orr activity mass transfer capacity and less resistance after 20 days start up and operation electricity generation from swine wastewater could be achieved by the mfcs and the output voltage has been stable the output voltage at 1000 ω of mfcs with tc x x 600 700 800 900 and pt c was then recorded for several cycles and shown in fig 6 c consistent with the former results tc 700 cathode mfc obtained the maximum voltage of 0 529 v at the beginning during the recording period slightly higher than pt c cathode mfc 0 513 v and obviously higher than tc 600 cathode mfc 0 478 v tc 800 cathode mfc 0 435 v and tc 900 cathode mfc 0 337 v suggesting its good orr activity in the real swine wastewater because of a higher co nx and pyridinic n content electron transfer between the o2 and electrode was accelerated moreover the appropriate pore structure with high ssa and uneven surface endow it with good active sites accessibility in spite of the biofouling resulting in a lower diffusion resistance rd and higher voltage output the encaptured co nanoparticles and co3c graphitic carbon and graphitic n also played important roles in accelerating electron transfer and improving the conductivity thus decreasing the charge transfer resistance rct all of the above points contributed a higher output voltage after several cycles of operation little decrease was observed in the curve of tc 700 cathode mfc while the pt c cathode mfc displayed an obvious deterioration on output voltage and its voltage was always lower due to the synthetic effect of biofouling and pt poisoning 21 37 this demonstrated that tc 700 had good operational stability which was crucial for its application in mfcs to treat the real wastewater the cod removal of tc 700 cathode mfc was 81 8 1 57 fig 6 d tc 800 cathode mfc showed the highest removal of 82 92 2 63 while pt c cathode mfc the lowest removal of 78 45 1 57 however there was an obvious difference in the ce pt c cathode mfc obtained a highest ce of 6 6 0 43 slightly higher than the tc 700 cathode mfc 6 18 0 38 and tc 600 cathode mfc 6 25 0 3 tc 800 cathode mfc shown the lowest ce of 5 72 0 02 besides other parameters of the effluent were also measured as shown in the fig 6 e all of the mfcs had little removal effect on total phosphorus data not shown however those mfcs displayed a good capacity for nh4 n and tn removal the removal rate for tc 700 cathode mfc was 35 0 2 0 for nh4 n and 33 5 2 4 for tn higher than tc 600 cathode mfc and pt c cathode mfc those results further demonstrated the potential of tc 700 when used in a mfc for real sw treatment the ph of the effluent was all above 8 0 suggesting the sufficient alkalinity and good buffer capacity in the sw which was crucial for the stability and activity of m n c catalyst too finally the performance of tc 700 cathode mfc was also compared to other studies table 2 the power output of tc 700 cathode mfc is comparable to or a little better than that from pt c or reported catalyst even though artificial wastewater was used and obviously higher than that with swine wastewater however the ce of this study was far lower than that with artificial wastewater which may be because that organic compounds in sw were complex macromolecules such as protein polysaccharide needing further degradation for exoelectrogens and competitive bacteria especially methanogens denitrifier and desulfurizer would also consumed much cod perhaps that s why the tn was decreased 3 4 microbial community analysis for tc 700 cathode mfc microbial communities of the anode and cathode at different levels were determined to further understand the mechanisms of pollutants removal and electricity generation at the phylum level fig s8 a 15 phyla were found to on the electrode biofilms and 7 and 10 phyla were dominant 1 at the anode and cathode biofilm respectively the phyla of firmicutes 29 35 proteobacteria 21 42 bacteroidota 19 62 desulfobacterota 11 32 synergistota 8 07 actinobacteriota 6 16 were most dominant in the anode biofilm among which proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteriota were related to electricity generation 45 in addition the richness of bacteroidota was also reported by many reports which could also contribute to the improvement of mfc s power output and the long time stability and may relate to nitrogen removal 46 47 another dominant phylum desulfobacterota was responsible for sulfate reduction and related fermentation according to previous report 48 the phylum synergistotas is the typical acetogen which has the ability to decompose organic matter into acetate 49 most of those phyla were also discovered in the cathode biofilm their abundance and mutualism may be an important factor for mfc to acquire high electricity production and remove the pollutants from sw efficiently at the class level fig s8 b 15 dominant classes 1 were identified in the biofilm of anode and cathode the relative abundance of bacteroidia clostridia gammaproteobacteria synergistia actinobacteria bacilli alphaproteobacteria were 19 53 22 63 15 02 8 07 3 65 2 66 6 41 9 97 in the anode biofilm and 28 31 17 38 5 21 9 42 12 35 8 73 3 76 in the cathode biofilm the class of clostridia was reported to be capable of transforming organics to volatile fatty acids vfs while the class of bacteroidia was related to the metabolism of amino acids and converted them to acetate ultimately 50 besides some of actinobacteria in the cathode biofilm 12 35 was identified for dissimilatory metal reduction and denitrification which may be capable of receiving electrons from the cathode for nox n x 2 3 reduction 51 the α and γ proteobacteria known as the typical electroactive bacteria eab may be responsible for extracellular electron transfer eet 52 53 and their existence in the cathode biofilm would also facilitate the electroreduction of nox n but competing with the orr on the catalyst for electrons finally the microbial communities at genus level were illustrated by the heatmap in fig s8 c and there were 60 genera identified with a total relative abundance 0 5 at the two biofilms there was a little difference between the structures which may be attributed to the specific function and the surface properties of the electrodes at the anode biofilm typical eab such as lentimicrobium 4 89 acinetobacter 4 65 rhodopseudomonas 4 57 pseudomonas 2 73 comamonas 0 61 were found in greater abundance than the cathode 45 54 55 for example lentimicrobium belong to the lentimicrobiaceae family was reported to be capable of regulating the indirect eet through their electron dense extracellular polymeric substances 54 while acinetobacter could transfer electrons through secreting an unidentified endogenous compound 55 in addition genus such as rhodopseudomonas pseudomonas were related to bioelectricity generation and sulfate reducing or nitrogen removal 45 56 besides some heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria such as advenella petrimonas were also found richer in anode biofilm 57 58 while some autotrophic denitrifiers such as thiobacillus paracoccus capable of cathode denitrification were discovered more in cathode biofilm 59 considering the complexity of sw composition there must be a lot of unidentified microorganisms that played important roles in the functions of mfc such as electricity generation and nitrogen removal but the anode biofilm must cover the main functions of mfc based on the above analysis if pollutants removal such as nitrogen and organics were conducted on the cathode biofilm the competition on electron and o2 between the catalyst and microorganisms was inevitable consequently the power output may deteriorate 4 conclusion in summary cheap tea residue was used to synthesize porous co n codoped carbon for mfc cathode through a green and sustainable mode of combining the nacl kcl eutectic salt and a little koh as the activator the as prepared tc 700 catalyst displayed high orr performance due to its high specific surface area 1009 5 m2 g and appropriate porous structure high co nx and pyridinic n content the tc 700 cathode mfc presented a high maximum power density 748 9 mw m2 and maximum output voltage 0 529 v with good stability when treating the real sw the pollutants removal capacity and energy recovery ability from sw of the mfc were also in high level microbial community analysis showed that lentimicrobium acinetobacter rhodopseudomonas pseudomonas comamonas were the dominant genus for electricity generation and denitrifiers such as advenella petrimonas played an important role in nitrogen removal this work focused on the development of low cost and efficient mfc cathode catalyst and its application in the real sw which may contribute to the practical application of mfc in sw treatment credit authorship contribution statement hongyi zhu conceptualization writing original draft writing review editing zhi zhang
