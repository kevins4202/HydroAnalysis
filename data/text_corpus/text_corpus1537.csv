7685,study region the yellow river basin yrb in china study focus the water resources supply demand imbalance hinders sustainable socioeconomic development which can be effectively addressed by the water resources allocation wra in this study a wra model was established based on supply demand forecast and comprehensive values of water resources sdf cvwr first the supply demand situation was analyzed to determine whether an imbalance existed considering the coordinated development of all systems a comprehensive index cvwr was proposed and its values in the current and planning years were quantified by emergy analysis method finally the model was solved by the genetic algorithm new hydrological insights for the region there were supply demand imbalances existing in the planning years 2025 2030 and the water shortages were 0 89 1010 m3 and 1 04 1010 m3 the cvwr were 3 58 1012 yuan and 3 61 1012 yuan showing an upward trend compared with the current year 2020 compared with 2020 the water allocated decreased in middle and upper reaches of the yrb in 2025 while increased in the lower reaches in 2030 except shanxi water allocated in other provinces regions was basically the same as that in 2025 these provide a scheme reference for wra in the yrb the model proposed in this study is verified to be applicable in addition the model can be flexibly used according to the actual parameters in different regions graphical abstract ga1 keywords water resources allocation model supply demand forecast comprehensive values of water resources emergy genetic algorithm data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction 1 1 research background water is the cradle of life which is an indispensable natural resource that affects social development and human progress and the most active and influential factor in the eco environment system dalin et al 2017 meng et al 2022 under the background of continuous social development water shortage problems have emerged worldwide wei et al 2020 the water resources crisis has become increasingly serious and water resources issues have become important hot spots for the international community jia et al 2020 in parallel water resources problems are extremely prominent in china among these problems the poor spatial matching of water and soil resources the large inter and intra annual changes in water resources supply and water pollution jointly cause the water shortage and the supply demand imbalance wu et al 2022 wang et al 2019 therefore in addition to advocating for water conservation reducing water pollution and paying attention to ecological water it is most important to allocate and manage the limited resources in a planned manner this approach not only relates to the development of social economy and eco environment but also affects the supporting capacity of sustainable development strategies jing et al 2022 wei et al 2020 1 2 literature review the water shortage coupled with the increasing demand for water has intensified the conflict among water users roozbahani et al 2015 studies have proved that such problems can be effectively alleviated through rational water resources allocation wra xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b however the rational wra is a highly complex risk decision making problem with multilevel multistage multiagent multi objective and nonlinear correlations moreover it is usually affected by objectives conflict non linear and socio economic conditions huang et al 2022 in recent years great progress has been made in wra both in terms of allocation objectives and allocation methods naghdi et al 2021 in wra objectives water resources can generate substantial economic benefits during the production and throughout the life of all water departments di et al 2021 hatamkhani et al 2022 showing that the wra can be guided by measuring the economic benefits of water resources lowe et al 2020 geng et al 2007 established a wra model aimed at maximizing the economic benefits and minimizing the regional water shortage providing a certain scientific basis for the optimal management and wra burnett et al 2017 put forward a dynamic framework to weigh the various uses of groundwater and calculate the relevant economic benefits and costs in hopes of guiding the wra during future water shortage changes as knowledge has improved and increasing harm has resulted from valuing social and economic production more than eco environment sustainability scholars have realized that there is a basic problem in the wra different stakeholders tend to different goals leading to water conflicts among them chen et al 2007 tu et al 2022 for example when scholars begin to build a bilevel programming model to optimize wra the pursuit of maximizing economic benefits minimizing water shortage and water pollutant discharge are important goals to consider tian et al 2019 xu et al 2013 established a bilevel programming model to balance the objectives of multiple decision makers with total social and economic benefits as the optimization objectives addressing the regional wra problem chen et al 2017 built a bilevel programming model based on the collaborative objectives of eco environment and economic benefits in which the upper model leader model determined the optimal water pollutant emission to meet the eco environmental objectives and the lower model follower model accepted the scheduling requirements of the upper model leading the optimal wra scheme to maximize the regional economic benefits however the above studies focus on two objectives to construct the double layer objective function which is more complicated in calculation additionally in the wra the social economic and eco environmental objectives should be comprehensively considered indicating that the double layer objective function may not meet all the requirements hence it is necessary to build a multi objective function hu et al 2016 established a wra model aimed at maximizing the average economic benefit efficiency and water distribution equity adopted a compromise planning method to weigh the efficiency and equity and gave each objective corresponding weight according to the preferences of decision makers to simplify the multi objective function for calculations chen et al 2020 regarded the economic social and eco environmental benefits as the goals of urban development these benefits can be assigned weight by the delphi method for an overall objective function then the urban wra model was established considering the supply demand relationship of the water resources although the above studies have simplified the objective function of the wra to a certain extent the determination of the objective weight is subjective the minimum deviation method can effectively reduce the error caused by subjectivity so it can be used to solve the objective function ren et al 2019 nevertheless this method only reduces the impact of subjectivity to a certain extent and does not really eliminate its impact the above studies are conducive to the formulation of comprehensive decision making by constructing multi objective functions related to wra but to a large extent they depend on the selected weight which may lead to subjective effects on the results thus leading to management strategies deviating from reality therefore on the basis of the overall consideration of society economy and eco environment this study has put forward a comprehensive index the comprehensive values of water resources cvwr the maximum of the cvwr was taken as the objective to guide the wra not only takes into account multi objectives such as social economic and eco environmental benefits but also eliminates the influence of subjectivity in terms of wra methods linear programming is widely used because its formula and algorithm are simple chen et al 2017 with the diversification of wra problems many scholars proposed improved methods based on linear programming lu et al 2011 proposed an irflp method to reasonably allocate agricultural water veintimilla reyes et al 2016 proposed a milp model to distribute the water supply of multiple rivers to meet various needs downstream of the basin ahmad et al 2018 constructed a double level multi objective linear programming model to optimize the wra among multiple water departments feng 2021 took economic social and eco environmental benefits into account and established a multi objective dynamic programming model under uncertain conditions realizing the optimal wra different allocation methods are adopted in the above studies to realize the optimal wra to realize the rational wra in the basin and the mitigate conflicts among systems a wra model based on the supply demand forecast and the cvwr sdf cvwr is constructed considering multi objective factors 1 3 contributions the rational wra not only affects the development of all systems but also enhances the supporting capacity of sustainable development strategies due to different resources endowments and development stages different regions have various water use benefits indicating that there is potential for allocation therefore it is of great significance to build a wra model based on sdf cvwr to realize the reasonable wra tian et al 2019 the main contributions are as follows 1 supply demand forecasts in the planning years clarify the supply demand situation in the basin based on which the rational wra scheme in the basin is further explored which helps to alleviate the conflict among different stakeholders to realize the sustainable development in the basin 2 considering the coordinated development of different systems a comprehensive index the cvwr is proposed the connotation was refined by the spatial water energy flows analysis in the eco economic system and its values in the current and planning years were quantified by the emergy analysis method 3 based on sdf cvwr a wra model with the goal of maximum cvwr is established which not only simplifies the traditional multi objective wra model but also eliminates subjectivity to some extent 2 research methods and materials 2 1 research methods 2 1 1 methods of supply demand forecast 2 1 1 1 available water supply forecast for the basin the sources of available water supply are surface water mainly coming from water storage water diversion and water lifting projects in the basin groundwater shallow and deep groundwater and other water sources sewage treatment reuse amount and rainfall utilization amount the available water supply forecast is developed based on certain natural water resources considering the existing water supply capacity the plannings and water supply conditions in the planning years and the constraints of water use conditions in this study the average annual available water supply of surface water is calculated according to the local water resources and water supply projects then combined with the proposed water supply projects and plannings in the future the available water supply in the planning years can be obtained 2 1 1 2 water demand forecast based on the social and economic development of the basin in the current year the future water demands for life production and the eco environment are predicted through comprehensive consideration and analysis of various planning and development measures 2 1 1 3 domestic water demand forecast the prediction of domestic water demand mainly includes the domestic water demand forecast for urban and rural residents which is typically based on the quota method the calculation formula is 2 1 w d 365 d i 1 2 p i α i 1000 where w d represents the domestic water demand m3 i represents the population type including urban and rural populations p i represents the population of type i people and α i is the water quota of the population of type i l people d which is determined according to the regional social water quota considering that the population growth rate r is related not only to the population p but also to the time t expressed as r p t φ p t t the improved logistic growth model is adopted for population prediction 2 2 d p d t φ p t t p p 0 p 0 i for φ p assuming that φ p is the linear function of p the formula is expressed as φ p r 0 λ p when p reaches the population capacity p m φ p m 0 then λ r 0 p m formula 2 2 can be optimized as 2 3 d p d t r 0 r 0 p m p t t p p 0 p 0 then p t p 0 1 p m p 1 exp 0 t r 0 t σ d σ 2 4 ii for t t adjusting formula 2 4 formula 2 5 can be obtained as 2 5 0 t r 0 t σ d σ ln p m p 0 p t p m p t p 0 assuming that t t is a polynomial of degree n of t 2 6 t t a 1 t n a 2 t n 1 a n t a n 1 by substituting formula 2 6 into 2 5 2 7 α 1 t n 1 α 2 t n α n 1 t ln p m p 0 p t p m p t p 0 where α 1 r 0 a 1 n 1 α 2 r 0 a 2 n α n r 0 a n 2 α n 1 r 0 a n 1 these can be determined by fitting the historical data of the population 2 1 1 4 agricultural production water demand forecast agricultural production water includes agricultural forestry and fruit irrigation aquaculture water and livestock water correspondingly agricultural water demand prediction mainly includes agricultural forestry and fruit irrigation aquaculture water and livestock water demand prediction the quota method is mainly used for prediction and the prediction formula is as follows 2 8 w a p n 1 4 a n β n 1000 m 1 2 n m β m where w a p represents agricultural production water m3 n represents different types of agricultural land including effective cultivated land area orchard area forest area and aquaculture area a n represents the area of agricultural land of type n m2 β n represents the water quota of agricultural land of type n m3 km2 which is determined according to the regional agricultural water consumption quota m represents the number of livestock which is divided into large livestock and small livestock in this paper due to the difference in water quota between them n m represents the number of livestock of type m head and β m represents the water quota of livestock of type m m3 head which is determined according to the regional agricultural water consumption quota 2 1 1 5 industrial production water demand forecast generally the industrial water demand forecast mainly refers to the general industrial water demand excluding the water for the thermal power industry the quota method is mainly used for prediction and the prediction formula is as follows 2 9 w i p m μ where w i p represents industrial production water m3 m represents industrial added value 104 yuan and μ represents the water quota m3 104 yuan which is determined according to the regional industrial water consumption quota 2 1 1 6 eco environment water demand forecast the eco environment water demand mainly refers to the water replenishment for the eco environment which only includes the urban environmental water supplied by artificial measures and some river lake and wetland replenishment excluding precipitation and runoff in this study it is mainly based on the comprehensive planning of the basin combined with historical water consumption using the regression analysis prediction method for forecasting 2 1 2 connotation of the cvwr eco economic system is a complex system with certain structure and function composed of social economic system and ecological system interrelated interactive and interwoven it is a structural unit of material cycle energy conversion value added and information transmission formed by technology and human labor lv 2009 reasonable use of water can promote the development of economic and social on the contrary it will lead to the deterioration of the eco environment and hinder the normal development jin yan et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to reasonably allocate the limited water resources to mitigate the water conflict among system in this section considering the coordinated development of all systems a comprehensive index the cvwr was proposed the spatial water energy flow diagram as shown in fig 1 was drawn by the emergy analysis method based on the water circulation and the accompanying energy flow transmission and transformation in the eco economic system based on which the connotation of the cvwr were refined water circulation and energy conversion are occurring continuously in each subsystem which finally manifests as social value agricultural production value industrial production value and eco environment value and the sum of these values is the cvwr 2 1 2 1 social subsystem in social subsystem solar energy wind energy and domestic water were input as the renewable energy while public finance food and government funds were input as the nonrenewable energy the spatial water energy flow in this subsystem is shown in fig 1 the specific analysis can be found in the research of zhang et al 2022 2 1 2 2 agricultural subsystem in agricultural subsystem solar energy wind energy and agricultural water were input as the renewable energy while topsoil loss was input as the nonrenewable energy the water flow in the agricultural subsystem is accompanied by the energy flow as shown in fig 1 which ultimately produces various agricultural products such as forest products planting products livestock products and fishery products reflecting the agricultural production values the specific analysis can be found in the research of wang et al 2021 2 1 2 3 industrial subsystem in industrial subsystem solar energy wind energy and industrial water were input as the renewable energy while raw coal and coal products crude oil electricity and labor services were input as the nonrenewable energy the water flow in the industrial subsystem is accompanied by the energy flow as shown in fig 1 finally producing various industrial products such as raw coal power generation aluminum and nonferrous metals reflecting industrial production values the specific analysis can be found in the research of huang et al 2020 2 1 2 4 eco environmental subsystem in eco environmental subsystem solar energy rainfall potential energy and wind energy were input as the renewable energy while silt and sediment were input as the nonrenewable energy the spatial water energy flow in the eco environment subsystem is shown in fig 1 water resources are responsible for the decomposition of aquatic plants and algae in the river and for human production and life they eventually reflect corresponding eco environmental values specific analysis can be seen in the relevant research of wu et al 2022 generally eco economic system consists of four interacting and interactive subsystems namely social agricultural industrial and eco environmental subsystems in which water cycle and energy conversion occur continuously and finally show in the form of value therefore the cvwr can be summarized as the sum of social values agricultural production value industrial production value and eco environmental values among them social values including two parts social security values and social stability values the eco environmental values can be summarized as dilution and purification value landscape value and water pollution loss value 2 1 3 quantification of the cvwr according to the connotation of the cvwr in section 2 1 2 in social subsystem as the source of life water resources first have the basic living security value to maintain the life and health of the population in the watershed based on this value people use water to carry out production activities which inevitably requires labor inputs and employment resulting in an employment security value simultaneously water resources have an endowment insurance value for employees engaged in water resources related fields water resources can provide safe and reliable water products for the population in the basin reflecting the positive value in maintaining social equity ensuring regional stability however floods often occur when water resources exceed the human capacity to use and control them disrupting the strategic deployment of socioeconomic development and affecting social stability this indicates that water resources also have negative social stability value the positive and negative social stability values together constitute the social stability values in the agricultural and industrial subsystems water resources provide essential factors for agricultural and industrial production reflecting the agricultural and industrial production values of water resources in eco environmental subsystem under the action of aquatic plant and algae in the river the water body has a certain self purification function reflecting the dilution and purification value of water resources in addition water resources can provide water sources for urban greening and landscape maintain the normal growth of plants reflecting the landscape value of water resources however people produce a large amount of sewage in production and daily life and excessive discharge of sewage will bring a burden to the eco environment that is water resources have water pollution loss value in summary 9 quantitative indicators were selected from 4 subsystems to quantify the cvwr table 1 the key point of the cvwr quantification is that the input parameters may have inconsistent dimensions which is difficult to overcome by traditional value quantification methods based on the above problem the emergy analysis method converting different kinds of energy into the solar emergy value with the same dimension through the transformity is used to realize the quantification of the cvwr as shown in table 1 the parameters are interpreted in table 2 2 1 4 wra model based on the supply demand forecast and cvwr 2 1 4 1 objective function under the dual pressures of rapid development of socioeconomic and high quality development of the eco environment the demand for water is more urgent however the irrational utilization of water can lead to the waste of water resources and even the deterioration of the eco environment aggravating supply demand imbalance and the conflict of water use in various systems this makes scholars realize that the cvwr should be maximized through rational wra based on the principles of basin development patterns ecological protection criteria and sustainable utilization of water resources in this section the objective function was built based on emergy values 2 10 m a x f x i 1 n f i x i 1 n j 1 m x

subarea yuan m3 and the other parameters are the same as those in table 2 2 1 4 2 constraint conditions according to the supply demand forecast three aspects are mainly considered when establishing the constraint conditions in terms of available water supply the total amount of water allocated in each subarea should be less than or equal to the available water supply of the basin in terms of water demand the water demand threshold of each subarea should be considered finally nonnegative constraints on water allocation should be considered specific constraints are shown in table 3 where w is the available water supply m3 l i and h i are the minimum and maximum water consumption thresholds of subarea i respectively m3 and n and x i have the same meanings as above fig 2 2 1 4 3 model solution the genetic algorithm ga originated from computer simulation of biological system is considered as a global random searching algorithm based on natural selection and genetic theory zhang et al 2020a its essence is the survival of the fittest in other words the best individuals are selected which is generally used to find the optimal solution of the model in order to explore the optimal solution of wra in the yrb the ga is selected the specific process of the model solution is as follows 2 2 study area and data source 2 2 1 study area the yellow river located in northern china is one of the longest rivers in the world which plays a crucial role in the strategic pattern of china s economic and social development tian et al 2022 because wheat cotton oil tobacco and animal husbandry products produced from the yellow river basin yrb account for a large proportion in the country it has a non negligible impact on the development of china s agricultural economy in parallel relying on abundant energy resources it supports energy production heavy chemical production steel production aluminum production machinery manufacturing and metallurgical industrial bases in the basin these resources represent relatively complete industrial categories and lay a foundation for the further development of the basin economy yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources yrcc mwr 2013 according to a series of water resources investigations and evaluations from 1956 to 2000 there are 6 47 1010 m3 of water resources in total in the yrb and the average annual natural runoff is 5 35 1010 m3 accounting for only 2 of water resources in the country nevertheless the yrb supplies water for almost 15 of the cultivated land and 12 of the population even transferring water long distances to some areas outside the basin the average annual groundwater resources mineralization less than or equal to 2 g l are 3 76 1010 m3 of which the groundwater resources are 2 63 1010 m3 in the hilly area 1 55 1010 m3 in the plains area and the repeated calculation amount between the hilly area and the plains area is 4 19 109 m3 at present apart from a total of 1 90 104 water storage projects 1 30 104 water diversion projects 2 20 104 water lifting projects and 6 03 105 electromechanical well projects built in the yrb a few sewage reuse and rainwater utilization projects have been completed the design and actual water supply capacity of various projects reach 5 57 1010 m3 and 4 76 1010 m3 respectively in addition there are more than 120 water supply culverts and pumping stations outside the basin 2 2 2 data source considering the availability of data this study takes 2020 as the current year and 2025 and 2030 as the planning years to explore the wra the original data sources are from the yellow river water resources bulletin comprehensive planning of the yellow river basin 2012 2030 regional water resources bulletin wastewater discharge yearbook china urban statistical yearbook china environmental statistics yearbook and china statistical yearbook the basic data of the current year are shown in table 4 2 3 research framework in this study the water supply and demand in the planning years were forecasted to explore the supply demand situations for the coordinated development of all systems a comprehensive index the cvwr was proposed its connotation was refined by the analysis of spatial water energy flow diagram and its value was quantified by the emergy analysis method then combined with the results of the supply demand forecast a wra model was constructed the model was applied in the yrb to verify its applicability the results may provide a reference for the rational wra in the basin the research framework is shown in fig 3 3 results and discussions 3 1 results of supply demand forecast in the yrb based on the underlying surface of the current year the average annual total water resources of the yellow river from 1956 to 2000 was 6 47 1010 m3 of which the river runoff was 5 35 1010 m3 and the nonrepetition between groundwater and surface water was 1 12 1010 m3 considering the impact of human activities mainly water for soil and water conservation on the underlying surface and natural runoff in the future it is predicted that the average annual water resources in 2025 and 2030 will be 6 30 1010 m3 and 6 27 1010 m3 respectively 3 1 1 results of available water supply forecasts based on the national economic development planning of the yrb and its adjacent areas after a long series of adjustments and calculations it is predicted that in the normal water supply year the available surface water supply of the yellow river in the planning years were 4 03 1010 m3 and 3 90 1010 m3 respectively the current annual groundwater exploitation is 1 13 1010 m3 following the principle of gradually returning the exploitation of deep groundwater and the overexploitation of shallow groundwater in plain areas appropriately increasing the exploitation of groundwater in ningxia and inner mongolia basically maintaining the current exploitation of groundwater in hilly areas it is expected that the exploitation of shallow groundwater will increase by 1 13 109 m3 and 1 21 109 m3 in the planning years for the available water supply of other water sources according to the national requirements for sewage treatment and reuse it is planned that the sewage treatment and the reuse rates will reach 90 and 40 50 in 2030 respectively therefore it is predicted that the sewage reuse amount will be 1 49 109 m3 and 1 88 109 m3 respectively in the current year the amount of rainwater resources utilized by the rainwater collection project is 0 8 108 m3 and it is estimated that rainwater water consumption will be 1 5 108 m3 and 1 6 108 m3 3 1 2 results of water demand forecasts 3 1 2 1 domestic water demand forecast based on the urban and rural population in the yrb from 2005 to 2020 the population inherent growth rate r 0 was calculated and the improved logistic growth model was used to forecast the urban and rural population in the yrb in the planning years as shown in fig 4 referring to the comprehensive planning and the social water quota of each province region considering the water saving policy it is predicted that the domestic water quota of urban will be 120 l person d and 124 l person d while of rural will be 68 l person d and 72 l person d 3 1 2 2 agricultural production water demand forecast based on the method of agricultural production water demand forecasts in section 2 1 3 relevant parameters and indices were predicted by fitting historical data 2005 2020 the prediction results are shown in fig 5 considering the development of water savings insufficient irrigation was adopted according to the agricultural water consumption quota of provinces regions it is predicted that the irrigation quota of arable areas will be reduced to 0 58 m3 m2 a and 0 54 m3 m2 a respectively the comprehensive irrigation quotas for orchard and forest areas will be 0 48 m3 m2 a and 0 46 m3 m2 a respectively and the fish pond replenishment quotas will be 1 53 m3 m2 a and 1 52 m3 m2 a respectively based on the comprehensive planning of the yrb considering the improvement of life quality and the increase in living demand in the planning years and the relevant planning of animal husbandry it is predicted that the comprehensive water quota for large and small livestock in the planning years will be 50 l head d and 19 l head d 3 1 2 3 industrial production water demand forecast based on the historical industrial added value in the yrb from 2005 to 2020 the growth rate was calculated and the industrial added values in the planning years were predicted as shown in fig 6 referring to the industrial water quota of provinces regions the industrial water quota will be reduced from 104 m3 104 yuan to 41 m3 104 yuan and 30 m3 104 yuan respectively however some provinces will experience a decrease in industrial added value such as gansu shanxi and shandong provinces from the definition of industrial value added it is the balance of the result of industrial production activities minus the material products consumed or transferred in the production process which is the newly created value of industry therefore when the total industrial output value is fixed and the intermediate inputs such as raw materials and energy consumption are low the industrial added value will show an increasing trend nevertheless when industrial enterprises blindly pursue the total industrial output value and ignore economic benefits resulting in high input costs it will lead to a downward trend in industrial added value 3 1 2 4 eco environment water demand forecast based on the historical eco environmental water consumption of the yrb from 2005 to 2020 combined with the comprehensive planning of the yrb the eco environmental water demands in the planning years were fitted and predicted as shown in fig 7 based on the above forecast results a summary of the water demand index forecasts in the yrb is obtained as shown in table 5 it can be seen from figs 4 to 7 and table 5 that the agricultural production water demand in the planning years will decrease slightly while the irrigation area increases slightly compared with the current year the demand of industrial production water will increase greatly when the industrial water quota decreases greatly generally without interbasin water transfer the total water supply in the planning years will reach 4 45 1010 m3 and 4 43 1010 m3 with water demands of 5 34 1010 m3 and 5 47 1010 m3 respectively as shown in table 6 3 1 3 analysis of supply demand situations according to the prediction results above the analysis of supply demand situations in the planning years in the yrb were carried out as shown in table 6 table 6 shows that there were supply demand imbalances in the planning years in normal water supply years the water shortages in the basin were 0 89 1010 m3 and 1 04 1010 m3 so it is urgent to reasonably allocate the limited water in the basin for alleviating the water conflict and improving the sustainable development of water 3 2 quantification of cvwr in the yrb according to the above results and analysis there are still supply demand imbalances in the planning years which can be effectively improved by wra based on sdf cvwr based on the water cycle and accompanying energy flow transmission and transformation in social agricultural industrial and ecological subsystems the energy input and output in each subsystem were analyzed in section 2 1 2 since the input energy may have inconsistent dimensions which cannot be calculated the transformity was used to convert different types of energy into solar emergy with the same dimension then the total input and output of emergy in each subsystem could be calculated separately finally the cvwr could be quantified according to the quantification methods in table 1 in section 2 1 3 taking henan province as an example the detailed calculation of agricultural production value is shown in table 7 in the same measure the indicators of the planning years 2025 and 2030 were forecasted based on the emergy inputs and outputs of each province region from 2005 to 2020 to establish the emergy analysis table and finally the cvwr of each province region in the yrb were calculated as shown in fig 8 and the comparison of the cvwr between the current and planning years is shown in fig 9 from the quantitative results of the cvwr in the yrb compared with the current year the cvwr in qinghai gansu shaanxi and shandong shows a trend from increase to decrease specifically manifested as a decrease in eco environment value it is worth noting that qinghai is the source of the yellow river although it has rich species diversity there are certain pressures and impacts on human activities resulting in low efficiency of eco environment water use the above provinces need to pay attention to education on eco environment protection in their future development the cvwr in shanxi shows a continuous downward trend with the industrial production value decreasing the most in terms of the value generated by water resources in various subsystems indicating that the efficiency of water resource utilization in the province is relatively low shanxi is an important heavy industry province in the north of china and heavy industry belongs to a high water consumption industry in subsequent development it is necessary to strengthen water saving publicity for enterprises and eliminate outdated electromechanical equipment with high water consumption conversely the cvwr in ningxia and inner mongolia shows a continuous upward trend specifically manifested by the increase in industrial production value indicating that the industrial water use efficiency in these two regions is relatively high 3 3 results of wra in the yrb due to the increase in water demand and the decrease in river runoff in the yrb the water shortages will reach 0 89 1010 m3 and 1 04 1010 m3 in the planning years to make the limited water resources have a greater cvwr the wra model based on the sdf cvwr was established the model was optimized and solved by the ga and finally the wra schemes in the yrb were obtained as shown in table 8 it can be seen from the wra results that the water allocated in the middle and upper reaches of the yrb will decrease in 2025 compared with the current year of which water resources in gansu will decrease the most indicating serious water resources waste and unreasonable utilization the amount of water allocated in shanxi henan and shandong in the lower reaches of the yrb will increase indicating that the above three provinces are more rational in water resources utilization and the utilization rates are also higher except for the water allocated in shanxi which shows a downward trend in 2030 the other water changes are basically the same as those in 2025 the terrain of shanxi is high but the water is low making it difficult to utilize it resulting in a downward trend in the water allocation in shanxi by 2030 the cvwr in the current year is 2 98 1012yuan and it will reach 3 58 1012 yuan in 2025 and 3 61 1012 yuan in 2030 fig 10 the cvwr presents an upward trend because with the increase in the urbanization rate people pay increasing attention to water saving efforts the water utilization rate was improved and its comprehensive value in the eco economic system also increases correspondingly this may be because with the sustainable development of industry and agriculture water saving facilities are gradually improved and sewage treatment methods are constantly updated it can be seen from the scheme of wra in 2025 and 2030 the water allocated in sichuan ningxia inner mongolia and henan will increase and in shanxi it will decrease significantly from the perspective of the cvwr it shows an upward trend in the former provinces regions and a downward trend in shanxi therefore shanxi should pay attention to the promotion of water conservation improve the water utilization rate and strengthen the sewage treatment capacity 4 conclusions and prospects 4 1 conclusions a wra model constructed based on sdf cvwr is proven to be feasible for exploring the wra scheme in the yrb the remarkable conclusions are as follows 1 the cvwr proposed in this research reflects the multifunctionality of water resources with the advantages of unifying quality and quantity natural resource value and environmental resource value and natural and social attributes the wra model was constructed with the goal of maximizing the cvwr without involving subjective parameters such as weights eliminating the subjective influence of decision makers in traditional wra models to some extent the model can set different parameters according to different regions having a wide range of applications 2 optimizing the wra based on water resources supply demand imbalance is of practical significance the yrb will be in a state of supply demand imbalance in 2025 and 2030 with water shortages of 0 89 1010 m3 and 1 04 1010 m3 respectively by developing the water resources supply demand forecast and water resources supply demand balance analysis 3 in the planning years the cvwr in the yrb excluding shanxi province show an upward trend with values of 3 58 1012 yuan and 3 61 1012 yuan respectively this shows that the public awareness of water resources protection has been gradually strengthened improving the utilization rate of water resources which also shows that the water management policies implemented in the yrb are effective 4 under the condition of intensifying supply demand conflicts a wra model based on sdf cvwr can provide a reasonable wra scheme for the basin compared with the current year the water allocated in the middle and upper reaches of the yrb will decrease in 2025 while in the lower reaches it will increase except the water allocated in shanxi province showing a downward trend in 2030 other changes are basically the same as those in 2025 4 2 prospects the results undoubtedly provide a decision making reference for the formulation of wra plan in the yrb in addition the wra model built in this study has been proved to be of practical significance and can be flexibly used according to the actual parameters in different regions however there are still some deficiencies which are mainly summarized in two parts 1 when forecasting the available water supply in the yrb the new external water transfer projects in the planning years were not considered that is the interbasin water transfer was not considered 2 to simplify the calculation the available water supply in the normal water supply years were forecasted but the available water supply under different water supply guarantee rates wet year and dry year were not considered for prediction in the future the interbasin water transfer and the available water supply under different guarantee rates will be considered

7685,study region the yellow river basin yrb in china study focus the water resources supply demand imbalance hinders sustainable socioeconomic development which can be effectively addressed by the water resources allocation wra in this study a wra model was established based on supply demand forecast and comprehensive values of water resources sdf cvwr first the supply demand situation was analyzed to determine whether an imbalance existed considering the coordinated development of all systems a comprehensive index cvwr was proposed and its values in the current and planning years were quantified by emergy analysis method finally the model was solved by the genetic algorithm new hydrological insights for the region there were supply demand imbalances existing in the planning years 2025 2030 and the water shortages were 0 89 1010 m3 and 1 04 1010 m3 the cvwr were 3 58 1012 yuan and 3 61 1012 yuan showing an upward trend compared with the current year 2020 compared with 2020 the water allocated decreased in middle and upper reaches of the yrb in 2025 while increased in the lower reaches in 2030 except shanxi water allocated in other provinces regions was basically the same as that in 2025 these provide a scheme reference for wra in the yrb the model proposed in this study is verified to be applicable in addition the model can be flexibly used according to the actual parameters in different regions graphical abstract ga1 keywords water resources allocation model supply demand forecast comprehensive values of water resources emergy genetic algorithm data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction 1 1 research background water is the cradle of life which is an indispensable natural resource that affects social development and human progress and the most active and influential factor in the eco environment system dalin et al 2017 meng et al 2022 under the background of continuous social development water shortage problems have emerged worldwide wei et al 2020 the water resources crisis has become increasingly serious and water resources issues have become important hot spots for the international community jia et al 2020 in parallel water resources problems are extremely prominent in china among these problems the poor spatial matching of water and soil resources the large inter and intra annual changes in water resources supply and water pollution jointly cause the water shortage and the supply demand imbalance wu et al 2022 wang et al 2019 therefore in addition to advocating for water conservation reducing water pollution and paying attention to ecological water it is most important to allocate and manage the limited resources in a planned manner this approach not only relates to the development of social economy and eco environment but also affects the supporting capacity of sustainable development strategies jing et al 2022 wei et al 2020 1 2 literature review the water shortage coupled with the increasing demand for water has intensified the conflict among water users roozbahani et al 2015 studies have proved that such problems can be effectively alleviated through rational water resources allocation wra xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b however the rational wra is a highly complex risk decision making problem with multilevel multistage multiagent multi objective and nonlinear correlations moreover it is usually affected by objectives conflict non linear and socio economic conditions huang et al 2022 in recent years great progress has been made in wra both in terms of allocation objectives and allocation methods naghdi et al 2021 in wra objectives water resources can generate substantial economic benefits during the production and throughout the life of all water departments di et al 2021 hatamkhani et al 2022 showing that the wra can be guided by measuring the economic benefits of water resources lowe et al 2020 geng et al 2007 established a wra model aimed at maximizing the economic benefits and minimizing the regional water shortage providing a certain scientific basis for the optimal management and wra burnett et al 2017 put forward a dynamic framework to weigh the various uses of groundwater and calculate the relevant economic benefits and costs in hopes of guiding the wra during future water shortage changes as knowledge has improved and increasing harm has resulted from valuing social and economic production more than eco environment sustainability scholars have realized that there is a basic problem in the wra different stakeholders tend to different goals leading to water conflicts among them chen et al 2007 tu et al 2022 for example when scholars begin to build a bilevel programming model to optimize wra the pursuit of maximizing economic benefits minimizing water shortage and water pollutant discharge are important goals to consider tian et al 2019 xu et al 2013 established a bilevel programming model to balance the objectives of multiple decision makers with total social and economic benefits as the optimization objectives addressing the regional wra problem chen et al 2017 built a bilevel programming model based on the collaborative objectives of eco environment and economic benefits in which the upper model leader model determined the optimal water pollutant emission to meet the eco environmental objectives and the lower model follower model accepted the scheduling requirements of the upper model leading the optimal wra scheme to maximize the regional economic benefits however the above studies focus on two objectives to construct the double layer objective function which is more complicated in calculation additionally in the wra the social economic and eco environmental objectives should be comprehensively considered indicating that the double layer objective function may not meet all the requirements hence it is necessary to build a multi objective function hu et al 2016 established a wra model aimed at maximizing the average economic benefit efficiency and water distribution equity adopted a compromise planning method to weigh the efficiency and equity and gave each objective corresponding weight according to the preferences of decision makers to simplify the multi objective function for calculations chen et al 2020 regarded the economic social and eco environmental benefits as the goals of urban development these benefits can be assigned weight by the delphi method for an overall objective function then the urban wra model was established considering the supply demand relationship of the water resources although the above studies have simplified the objective function of the wra to a certain extent the determination of the objective weight is subjective the minimum deviation method can effectively reduce the error caused by subjectivity so it can be used to solve the objective function ren et al 2019 nevertheless this method only reduces the impact of subjectivity to a certain extent and does not really eliminate its impact the above studies are conducive to the formulation of comprehensive decision making by constructing multi objective functions related to wra but to a large extent they depend on the selected weight which may lead to subjective effects on the results thus leading to management strategies deviating from reality therefore on the basis of the overall consideration of society economy and eco environment this study has put forward a comprehensive index the comprehensive values of water resources cvwr the maximum of the cvwr was taken as the objective to guide the wra not only takes into account multi objectives such as social economic and eco environmental benefits but also eliminates the influence of subjectivity in terms of wra methods linear programming is widely used because its formula and algorithm are simple chen et al 2017 with the diversification of wra problems many scholars proposed improved methods based on linear programming lu et al 2011 proposed an irflp method to reasonably allocate agricultural water veintimilla reyes et al 2016 proposed a milp model to distribute the water supply of multiple rivers to meet various needs downstream of the basin ahmad et al 2018 constructed a double level multi objective linear programming model to optimize the wra among multiple water departments feng 2021 took economic social and eco environmental benefits into account and established a multi objective dynamic programming model under uncertain conditions realizing the optimal wra different allocation methods are adopted in the above studies to realize the optimal wra to realize the rational wra in the basin and the mitigate conflicts among systems a wra model based on the supply demand forecast and the cvwr sdf cvwr is constructed considering multi objective factors 1 3 contributions the rational wra not only affects the development of all systems but also enhances the supporting capacity of sustainable development strategies due to different resources endowments and development stages different regions have various water use benefits indicating that there is potential for allocation therefore it is of great significance to build a wra model based on sdf cvwr to realize the reasonable wra tian et al 2019 the main contributions are as follows 1 supply demand forecasts in the planning years clarify the supply demand situation in the basin based on which the rational wra scheme in the basin is further explored which helps to alleviate the conflict among different stakeholders to realize the sustainable development in the basin 2 considering the coordinated development of different systems a comprehensive index the cvwr is proposed the connotation was refined by the spatial water energy flows analysis in the eco economic system and its values in the current and planning years were quantified by the emergy analysis method 3 based on sdf cvwr a wra model with the goal of maximum cvwr is established which not only simplifies the traditional multi objective wra model but also eliminates subjectivity to some extent 2 research methods and materials 2 1 research methods 2 1 1 methods of supply demand forecast 2 1 1 1 available water supply forecast for the basin the sources of available water supply are surface water mainly coming from water storage water diversion and water lifting projects in the basin groundwater shallow and deep groundwater and other water sources sewage treatment reuse amount and rainfall utilization amount the available water supply forecast is developed based on certain natural water resources considering the existing water supply capacity the plannings and water supply conditions in the planning years and the constraints of water use conditions in this study the average annual available water supply of surface water is calculated according to the local water resources and water supply projects then combined with the proposed water supply projects and plannings in the future the available water supply in the planning years can be obtained 2 1 1 2 water demand forecast based on the social and economic development of the basin in the current year the future water demands for life production and the eco environment are predicted through comprehensive consideration and analysis of various planning and development measures 2 1 1 3 domestic water demand forecast the prediction of domestic water demand mainly includes the domestic water demand forecast for urban and rural residents which is typically based on the quota method the calculation formula is 2 1 w d 365 d i 1 2 p i α i 1000 where w d represents the domestic water demand m3 i represents the population type including urban and rural populations p i represents the population of type i people and α i is the water quota of the population of type i l people d which is determined according to the regional social water quota considering that the population growth rate r is related not only to the population p but also to the time t expressed as r p t φ p t t the improved logistic growth model is adopted for population prediction 2 2 d p d t φ p t t p p 0 p 0 i for φ p assuming that φ p is the linear function of p the formula is expressed as φ p r 0 λ p when p reaches the population capacity p m φ p m 0 then λ r 0 p m formula 2 2 can be optimized as 2 3 d p d t r 0 r 0 p m p t t p p 0 p 0 then p t p 0 1 p m p 1 exp 0 t r 0 t σ d σ 2 4 ii for t t adjusting formula 2 4 formula 2 5 can be obtained as 2 5 0 t r 0 t σ d σ ln p m p 0 p t p m p t p 0 assuming that t t is a polynomial of degree n of t 2 6 t t a 1 t n a 2 t n 1 a n t a n 1 by substituting formula 2 6 into 2 5 2 7 α 1 t n 1 α 2 t n α n 1 t ln p m p 0 p t p m p t p 0 where α 1 r 0 a 1 n 1 α 2 r 0 a 2 n α n r 0 a n 2 α n 1 r 0 a n 1 these can be determined by fitting the historical data of the population 2 1 1 4 agricultural production water demand forecast agricultural production water includes agricultural forestry and fruit irrigation aquaculture water and livestock water correspondingly agricultural water demand prediction mainly includes agricultural forestry and fruit irrigation aquaculture water and livestock water demand prediction the quota method is mainly used for prediction and the prediction formula is as follows 2 8 w a p n 1 4 a n β n 1000 m 1 2 n m β m where w a p represents agricultural production water m3 n represents different types of agricultural land including effective cultivated land area orchard area forest area and aquaculture area a n represents the area of agricultural land of type n m2 β n represents the water quota of agricultural land of type n m3 km2 which is determined according to the regional agricultural water consumption quota m represents the number of livestock which is divided into large livestock and small livestock in this paper due to the difference in water quota between them n m represents the number of livestock of type m head and β m represents the water quota of livestock of type m m3 head which is determined according to the regional agricultural water consumption quota 2 1 1 5 industrial production water demand forecast generally the industrial water demand forecast mainly refers to the general industrial water demand excluding the water for the thermal power industry the quota method is mainly used for prediction and the prediction formula is as follows 2 9 w i p m μ where w i p represents industrial production water m3 m represents industrial added value 104 yuan and μ represents the water quota m3 104 yuan which is determined according to the regional industrial water consumption quota 2 1 1 6 eco environment water demand forecast the eco environment water demand mainly refers to the water replenishment for the eco environment which only includes the urban environmental water supplied by artificial measures and some river lake and wetland replenishment excluding precipitation and runoff in this study it is mainly based on the comprehensive planning of the basin combined with historical water consumption using the regression analysis prediction method for forecasting 2 1 2 connotation of the cvwr eco economic system is a complex system with certain structure and function composed of social economic system and ecological system interrelated interactive and interwoven it is a structural unit of material cycle energy conversion value added and information transmission formed by technology and human labor lv 2009 reasonable use of water can promote the development of economic and social on the contrary it will lead to the deterioration of the eco environment and hinder the normal development jin yan et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to reasonably allocate the limited water resources to mitigate the water conflict among system in this section considering the coordinated development of all systems a comprehensive index the cvwr was proposed the spatial water energy flow diagram as shown in fig 1 was drawn by the emergy analysis method based on the water circulation and the accompanying energy flow transmission and transformation in the eco economic system based on which the connotation of the cvwr were refined water circulation and energy conversion are occurring continuously in each subsystem which finally manifests as social value agricultural production value industrial production value and eco environment value and the sum of these values is the cvwr 2 1 2 1 social subsystem in social subsystem solar energy wind energy and domestic water were input as the renewable energy while public finance food and government funds were input as the nonrenewable energy the spatial water energy flow in this subsystem is shown in fig 1 the specific analysis can be found in the research of zhang et al 2022 2 1 2 2 agricultural subsystem in agricultural subsystem solar energy wind energy and agricultural water were input as the renewable energy while topsoil loss was input as the nonrenewable energy the water flow in the agricultural subsystem is accompanied by the energy flow as shown in fig 1 which ultimately produces various agricultural products such as forest products planting products livestock products and fishery products reflecting the agricultural production values the specific analysis can be found in the research of wang et al 2021 2 1 2 3 industrial subsystem in industrial subsystem solar energy wind energy and industrial water were input as the renewable energy while raw coal and coal products crude oil electricity and labor services were input as the nonrenewable energy the water flow in the industrial subsystem is accompanied by the energy flow as shown in fig 1 finally producing various industrial products such as raw coal power generation aluminum and nonferrous metals reflecting industrial production values the specific analysis can be found in the research of huang et al 2020 2 1 2 4 eco environmental subsystem in eco environmental subsystem solar energy rainfall potential energy and wind energy were input as the renewable energy while silt and sediment were input as the nonrenewable energy the spatial water energy flow in the eco environment subsystem is shown in fig 1 water resources are responsible for the decomposition of aquatic plants and algae in the river and for human production and life they eventually reflect corresponding eco environmental values specific analysis can be seen in the relevant research of wu et al 2022 generally eco economic system consists of four interacting and interactive subsystems namely social agricultural industrial and eco environmental subsystems in which water cycle and energy conversion occur continuously and finally show in the form of value therefore the cvwr can be summarized as the sum of social values agricultural production value industrial production value and eco environmental values among them social values including two parts social security values and social stability values the eco environmental values can be summarized as dilution and purification value landscape value and water pollution loss value 2 1 3 quantification of the cvwr according to the connotation of the cvwr in section 2 1 2 in social subsystem as the source of life water resources first have the basic living security value to maintain the life and health of the population in the watershed based on this value people use water to carry out production activities which inevitably requires labor inputs and employment resulting in an employment security value simultaneously water resources have an endowment insurance value for employees engaged in water resources related fields water resources can provide safe and reliable water products for the population in the basin reflecting the positive value in maintaining social equity ensuring regional stability however floods often occur when water resources exceed the human capacity to use and control them disrupting the strategic deployment of socioeconomic development and affecting social stability this indicates that water resources also have negative social stability value the positive and negative social stability values together constitute the social stability values in the agricultural and industrial subsystems water resources provide essential factors for agricultural and industrial production reflecting the agricultural and industrial production values of water resources in eco environmental subsystem under the action of aquatic plant and algae in the river the water body has a certain self purification function reflecting the dilution and purification value of water resources in addition water resources can provide water sources for urban greening and landscape maintain the normal growth of plants reflecting the landscape value of water resources however people produce a large amount of sewage in production and daily life and excessive discharge of sewage will bring a burden to the eco environment that is water resources have water pollution loss value in summary 9 quantitative indicators were selected from 4 subsystems to quantify the cvwr table 1 the key point of the cvwr quantification is that the input parameters may have inconsistent dimensions which is difficult to overcome by traditional value quantification methods based on the above problem the emergy analysis method converting different kinds of energy into the solar emergy value with the same dimension through the transformity is used to realize the quantification of the cvwr as shown in table 1 the parameters are interpreted in table 2 2 1 4 wra model based on the supply demand forecast and cvwr 2 1 4 1 objective function under the dual pressures of rapid development of socioeconomic and high quality development of the eco environment the demand for water is more urgent however the irrational utilization of water can lead to the waste of water resources and even the deterioration of the eco environment aggravating supply demand imbalance and the conflict of water use in various systems this makes scholars realize that the cvwr should be maximized through rational wra based on the principles of basin development patterns ecological protection criteria and sustainable utilization of water resources in this section the objective function was built based on emergy values 2 10 m a x f x i 1 n f i x i 1 n j 1 m x

subarea yuan m3 and the other parameters are the same as those in table 2 2 1 4 2 constraint conditions according to the supply demand forecast three aspects are mainly considered when establishing the constraint conditions in terms of available water supply the total amount of water allocated in each subarea should be less than or equal to the available water supply of the basin in terms of water demand the water demand threshold of each subarea should be considered finally nonnegative constraints on water allocation should be considered specific constraints are shown in table 3 where w is the available water supply m3 l i and h i are the minimum and maximum water consumption thresholds of subarea i respectively m3 and n and x i have the same meanings as above fig 2 2 1 4 3 model solution the genetic algorithm ga originated from computer simulation of biological system is considered as a global random searching algorithm based on natural selection and genetic theory zhang et al 2020a its essence is the survival of the fittest in other words the best individuals are selected which is generally used to find the optimal solution of the model in order to explore the optimal solution of wra in the yrb the ga is selected the specific process of the model solution is as follows 2 2 study area and data source 2 2 1 study area the yellow river located in northern china is one of the longest rivers in the world which plays a crucial role in the strategic pattern of china s economic and social development tian et al 2022 because wheat cotton oil tobacco and animal husbandry products produced from the yellow river basin yrb account for a large proportion in the country it has a non negligible impact on the development of china s agricultural economy in parallel relying on abundant energy resources it supports energy production heavy chemical production steel production aluminum production machinery manufacturing and metallurgical industrial bases in the basin these resources represent relatively complete industrial categories and lay a foundation for the further development of the basin economy yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources yrcc mwr 2013 according to a series of water resources investigations and evaluations from 1956 to 2000 there are 6 47 1010 m3 of water resources in total in the yrb and the average annual natural runoff is 5 35 1010 m3 accounting for only 2 of water resources in the country nevertheless the yrb supplies water for almost 15 of the cultivated land and 12 of the population even transferring water long distances to some areas outside the basin the average annual groundwater resources mineralization less than or equal to 2 g l are 3 76 1010 m3 of which the groundwater resources are 2 63 1010 m3 in the hilly area 1 55 1010 m3 in the plains area and the repeated calculation amount between the hilly area and the plains area is 4 19 109 m3 at present apart from a total of 1 90 104 water storage projects 1 30 104 water diversion projects 2 20 104 water lifting projects and 6 03 105 electromechanical well projects built in the yrb a few sewage reuse and rainwater utilization projects have been completed the design and actual water supply capacity of various projects reach 5 57 1010 m3 and 4 76 1010 m3 respectively in addition there are more than 120 water supply culverts and pumping stations outside the basin 2 2 2 data source considering the availability of data this study takes 2020 as the current year and 2025 and 2030 as the planning years to explore the wra the original data sources are from the yellow river water resources bulletin comprehensive planning of the yellow river basin 2012 2030 regional water resources bulletin wastewater discharge yearbook china urban statistical yearbook china environmental statistics yearbook and china statistical yearbook the basic data of the current year are shown in table 4 2 3 research framework in this study the water supply and demand in the planning years were forecasted to explore the supply demand situations for the coordinated development of all systems a comprehensive index the cvwr was proposed its connotation was refined by the analysis of spatial water energy flow diagram and its value was quantified by the emergy analysis method then combined with the results of the supply demand forecast a wra model was constructed the model was applied in the yrb to verify its applicability the results may provide a reference for the rational wra in the basin the research framework is shown in fig 3 3 results and discussions 3 1 results of supply demand forecast in the yrb based on the underlying surface of the current year the average annual total water resources of the yellow river from 1956 to 2000 was 6 47 1010 m3 of which the river runoff was 5 35 1010 m3 and the nonrepetition between groundwater and surface water was 1 12 1010 m3 considering the impact of human activities mainly water for soil and water conservation on the underlying surface and natural runoff in the future it is predicted that the average annual water resources in 2025 and 2030 will be 6 30 1010 m3 and 6 27 1010 m3 respectively 3 1 1 results of available water supply forecasts based on the national economic development planning of the yrb and its adjacent areas after a long series of adjustments and calculations it is predicted that in the normal water supply year the available surface water supply of the yellow river in the planning years were 4 03 1010 m3 and 3 90 1010 m3 respectively the current annual groundwater exploitation is 1 13 1010 m3 following the principle of gradually returning the exploitation of deep groundwater and the overexploitation of shallow groundwater in plain areas appropriately increasing the exploitation of groundwater in ningxia and inner mongolia basically maintaining the current exploitation of groundwater in hilly areas it is expected that the exploitation of shallow groundwater will increase by 1 13 109 m3 and 1 21 109 m3 in the planning years for the available water supply of other water sources according to the national requirements for sewage treatment and reuse it is planned that the sewage treatment and the reuse rates will reach 90 and 40 50 in 2030 respectively therefore it is predicted that the sewage reuse amount will be 1 49 109 m3 and 1 88 109 m3 respectively in the current year the amount of rainwater resources utilized by the rainwater collection project is 0 8 108 m3 and it is estimated that rainwater water consumption will be 1 5 108 m3 and 1 6 108 m3 3 1 2 results of water demand forecasts 3 1 2 1 domestic water demand forecast based on the urban and rural population in the yrb from 2005 to 2020 the population inherent growth rate r 0 was calculated and the improved logistic growth model was used to forecast the urban and rural population in the yrb in the planning years as shown in fig 4 referring to the comprehensive planning and the social water quota of each province region considering the water saving policy it is predicted that the domestic water quota of urban will be 120 l person d and 124 l person d while of rural will be 68 l person d and 72 l person d 3 1 2 2 agricultural production water demand forecast based on the method of agricultural production water demand forecasts in section 2 1 3 relevant parameters and indices were predicted by fitting historical data 2005 2020 the prediction results are shown in fig 5 considering the development of water savings insufficient irrigation was adopted according to the agricultural water consumption quota of provinces regions it is predicted that the irrigation quota of arable areas will be reduced to 0 58 m3 m2 a and 0 54 m3 m2 a respectively the comprehensive irrigation quotas for orchard and forest areas will be 0 48 m3 m2 a and 0 46 m3 m2 a respectively and the fish pond replenishment quotas will be 1 53 m3 m2 a and 1 52 m3 m2 a respectively based on the comprehensive planning of the yrb considering the improvement of life quality and the increase in living demand in the planning years and the relevant planning of animal husbandry it is predicted that the comprehensive water quota for large and small livestock in the planning years will be 50 l head d and 19 l head d 3 1 2 3 industrial production water demand forecast based on the historical industrial added value in the yrb from 2005 to 2020 the growth rate was calculated and the industrial added values in the planning years were predicted as shown in fig 6 referring to the industrial water quota of provinces regions the industrial water quota will be reduced from 104 m3 104 yuan to 41 m3 104 yuan and 30 m3 104 yuan respectively however some provinces will experience a decrease in industrial added value such as gansu shanxi and shandong provinces from the definition of industrial value added it is the balance of the result of industrial production activities minus the material products consumed or transferred in the production process which is the newly created value of industry therefore when the total industrial output value is fixed and the intermediate inputs such as raw materials and energy consumption are low the industrial added value will show an increasing trend nevertheless when industrial enterprises blindly pursue the total industrial output value and ignore economic benefits resulting in high input costs it will lead to a downward trend in industrial added value 3 1 2 4 eco environment water demand forecast based on the historical eco environmental water consumption of the yrb from 2005 to 2020 combined with the comprehensive planning of the yrb the eco environmental water demands in the planning years were fitted and predicted as shown in fig 7 based on the above forecast results a summary of the water demand index forecasts in the yrb is obtained as shown in table 5 it can be seen from figs 4 to 7 and table 5 that the agricultural production water demand in the planning years will decrease slightly while the irrigation area increases slightly compared with the current year the demand of industrial production water will increase greatly when the industrial water quota decreases greatly generally without interbasin water transfer the total water supply in the planning years will reach 4 45 1010 m3 and 4 43 1010 m3 with water demands of 5 34 1010 m3 and 5 47 1010 m3 respectively as shown in table 6 3 1 3 analysis of supply demand situations according to the prediction results above the analysis of supply demand situations in the planning years in the yrb were carried out as shown in table 6 table 6 shows that there were supply demand imbalances in the planning years in normal water supply years the water shortages in the basin were 0 89 1010 m3 and 1 04 1010 m3 so it is urgent to reasonably allocate the limited water in the basin for alleviating the water conflict and improving the sustainable development of water 3 2 quantification of cvwr in the yrb according to the above results and analysis there are still supply demand imbalances in the planning years which can be effectively improved by wra based on sdf cvwr based on the water cycle and accompanying energy flow transmission and transformation in social agricultural industrial and ecological subsystems the energy input and output in each subsystem were analyzed in section 2 1 2 since the input energy may have inconsistent dimensions which cannot be calculated the transformity was used to convert different types of energy into solar emergy with the same dimension then the total input and output of emergy in each subsystem could be calculated separately finally the cvwr could be quantified according to the quantification methods in table 1 in section 2 1 3 taking henan province as an example the detailed calculation of agricultural production value is shown in table 7 in the same measure the indicators of the planning years 2025 and 2030 were forecasted based on the emergy inputs and outputs of each province region from 2005 to 2020 to establish the emergy analysis table and finally the cvwr of each province region in the yrb were calculated as shown in fig 8 and the comparison of the cvwr between the current and planning years is shown in fig 9 from the quantitative results of the cvwr in the yrb compared with the current year the cvwr in qinghai gansu shaanxi and shandong shows a trend from increase to decrease specifically manifested as a decrease in eco environment value it is worth noting that qinghai is the source of the yellow river although it has rich species diversity there are certain pressures and impacts on human activities resulting in low efficiency of eco environment water use the above provinces need to pay attention to education on eco environment protection in their future development the cvwr in shanxi shows a continuous downward trend with the industrial production value decreasing the most in terms of the value generated by water resources in various subsystems indicating that the efficiency of water resource utilization in the province is relatively low shanxi is an important heavy industry province in the north of china and heavy industry belongs to a high water consumption industry in subsequent development it is necessary to strengthen water saving publicity for enterprises and eliminate outdated electromechanical equipment with high water consumption conversely the cvwr in ningxia and inner mongolia shows a continuous upward trend specifically manifested by the increase in industrial production value indicating that the industrial water use efficiency in these two regions is relatively high 3 3 results of wra in the yrb due to the increase in water demand and the decrease in river runoff in the yrb the water shortages will reach 0 89 1010 m3 and 1 04 1010 m3 in the planning years to make the limited water resources have a greater cvwr the wra model based on the sdf cvwr was established the model was optimized and solved by the ga and finally the wra schemes in the yrb were obtained as shown in table 8 it can be seen from the wra results that the water allocated in the middle and upper reaches of the yrb will decrease in 2025 compared with the current year of which water resources in gansu will decrease the most indicating serious water resources waste and unreasonable utilization the amount of water allocated in shanxi henan and shandong in the lower reaches of the yrb will increase indicating that the above three provinces are more rational in water resources utilization and the utilization rates are also higher except for the water allocated in shanxi which shows a downward trend in 2030 the other water changes are basically the same as those in 2025 the terrain of shanxi is high but the water is low making it difficult to utilize it resulting in a downward trend in the water allocation in shanxi by 2030 the cvwr in the current year is 2 98 1012yuan and it will reach 3 58 1012 yuan in 2025 and 3 61 1012 yuan in 2030 fig 10 the cvwr presents an upward trend because with the increase in the urbanization rate people pay increasing attention to water saving efforts the water utilization rate was improved and its comprehensive value in the eco economic system also increases correspondingly this may be because with the sustainable development of industry and agriculture water saving facilities are gradually improved and sewage treatment methods are constantly updated it can be seen from the scheme of wra in 2025 and 2030 the water allocated in sichuan ningxia inner mongolia and henan will increase and in shanxi it will decrease significantly from the perspective of the cvwr it shows an upward trend in the former provinces regions and a downward trend in shanxi therefore shanxi should pay attention to the promotion of water conservation improve the water utilization rate and strengthen the sewage treatment capacity 4 conclusions and prospects 4 1 conclusions a wra model constructed based on sdf cvwr is proven to be feasible for exploring the wra scheme in the yrb the remarkable conclusions are as follows 1 the cvwr proposed in this research reflects the multifunctionality of water resources with the advantages of unifying quality and quantity natural resource value and environmental resource value and natural and social attributes the wra model was constructed with the goal of maximizing the cvwr without involving subjective parameters such as weights eliminating the subjective influence of decision makers in traditional wra models to some extent the model can set different parameters according to different regions having a wide range of applications 2 optimizing the wra based on water resources supply demand imbalance is of practical significance the yrb will be in a state of supply demand imbalance in 2025 and 2030 with water shortages of 0 89 1010 m3 and 1 04 1010 m3 respectively by developing the water resources supply demand forecast and water resources supply demand balance analysis 3 in the planning years the cvwr in the yrb excluding shanxi province show an upward trend with values of 3 58 1012 yuan and 3 61 1012 yuan respectively this shows that the public awareness of water resources protection has been gradually strengthened improving the utilization rate of water resources which also shows that the water management policies implemented in the yrb are effective 4 under the condition of intensifying supply demand conflicts a wra model based on sdf cvwr can provide a reasonable wra scheme for the basin compared with the current year the water allocated in the middle and upper reaches of the yrb will decrease in 2025 while in the lower reaches it will increase except the water allocated in shanxi province showing a downward trend in 2030 other changes are basically the same as those in 2025 4 2 prospects the results undoubtedly provide a decision making reference for the formulation of wra plan in the yrb in addition the wra model built in this study has been proved to be of practical significance and can be flexibly used according to the actual parameters in different regions however there are still some deficiencies which are mainly summarized in two parts 1 when forecasting the available water supply in the yrb the new external water transfer projects in the planning years were not considered that is the interbasin water transfer was not considered 2 to simplify the calculation the available water supply in the normal water supply years were forecasted but the available water supply under different water supply guarantee rates wet year and dry year were not considered for prediction in the future the interbasin water transfer and the available water supply under different guarantee rates will be considered

7686,study region main alluvial aquifers of the murray darling basin mdb australia study focus around 75 of total metered groundwater use within australia s murray darling basin mdb arguably the nation s most important food and fibre production region is extracted from eight main alluvial aquifer systems to date regional scale analyses of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability for the region have not been completed this study provides a systemic overview of the main alluvial systems anchored in these concepts to achieve this we combined three lines of evidence encompassing a long term trend analysis of groundwater levels b calculation of groundwater footprint indices considering volume and quality and c an explicit comparison of groundwater management areas in terms of groundwater usage sustainable use storage volumes presence and diversity of groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes and buffering capacity to absorb changes in recharge rates new hydrological insights for the region the novelty of our work rests upon an integrated assessment of these three lines of evidence incorporating twelve different metrics to prioritise future groundwater management efforts results indicate that eleven out of twenty two groundwater management areas show resilience stress and or sustainability issues and a further two with emergent issues efforts to improve our understanding and management of these key groundwater resources would be most effective if focussed on these areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater resilience groundwater stress groundwater footprint groundwater sustainability indicator based assessment mdb data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is the largest freshwater resource across the globe nearly 50 of drinking water and 43 of irrigation water is sourced from aquifers elshall et al 2020 around the world the continued use of groundwater has resulted in problems such as declining groundwater levels land subsidence groundwater quality deterioration decrease or loss of streamflow springs and threats to groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes at different scales anderson 2014 de graaf et al 2019 martinsen et al 2022 milman and macdonald 2020 despite these challenges due to the buffering effect of high storage volumes relative to recharge some groundwater systems can offer a more robust and resilient supply compared with surface water systems which are generally more directly impacted by increased climate variability kundzewicz and döll 2009 thomas et al 2017 however groundwater systems with limited storage e g shallow narrow aquifers and those with strong surface water connections are vulnerable and sensitive to climate variability change kundzewicz and döll 2009 research on the concepts of aquifer vulnerability sensitivity rine et al 2006 watson et al 2020 and potential mukherjee et al 2012 has been primarily dominated by methods assessing pollution risk and vulnerability butler 2010 rine et al 2006 only recently concepts such as groundwater resilience stress and sustainability have received a surge of attention to describing groundwater resources under a systemic lens akbar et al 2022 de la hera portillo et al 2021 elshall et al 2020 gleeson et al 2012 2020 majidipour et al 2021 richey et al 2015b except for akbar et al 2022 who simultaneously analyse the concepts of groundwater scarcity stress and sustainability using index based assessment previous research has focused mainly on the individual assessment of these concepts these assessments have been mostly at a global scale and cover different aquifer types with only a handful of articles addressing alluvial aquifers specifically fuchs et al 2018 jianbing et al 2020 tabarmayeh et al 2022 alexakis et al 2021 samani 2021 however none of the previous research on alluvial aquifers analysed these concepts simultaneously in this work we simultaneously explored and applied the concepts of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability to a case study in the murray darlin basin mdb australia to obtain a systemic view of groundwater resources hosted in the main alluvial aquifers groundwater resilience can be defined as the ability of a groundwater system to maintain reserves and its essential functions despite major anthropogenic disturbances sharma and sharma 2006 de la hera portillo et al 2021 supply oriented definitions define it as the long term reliability of groundwater supplies balancing long term recharge and pumping rates chinnasamy et al 2018 or as the capacity to absorb variable pumping stresses under variable recharge and surface water availability fuchs et al 2018 description of groundwater storage long term pumping stresses and recharge rates and the groundwater system s functionality e g water supply support to gdes are key aspects of these definitions it can then be argued that systems with larger storage capacities are expected to be more resilient to external drivers compared to those of smaller volume chinnasamy et al 2018 macdonald et al 2011 and that groundwater storage is necessary to describe groundwater resilience richey 2014 for intensively exploited aquifers pumping stress is a major driver and therefore the resilience analysis should be framed around identifying trends towards new dynamic equilibrium stages de la hera portillo et al 2021 groundwater stress can be broadly defined as the ratio between the use and availability of groundwater resources thomas and famiglietti 2019 the ratio between the groundwater footprint gf and the aquifer area gleeson et al 2012 gleeson and wada 2013 or the ratio of total storage to the groundwater depletion rate richey et al 2015a there exists an abundant collection of methods to calculate groundwater stress supplementary material s 2 see e g mohan 2019 richey et al 2015b alley et al 2018 herbert and döll 2019 hernández espriú et al 2019 gleeson et al 2012 gleeson

conditions when driven by global scale datasets alley et al 2018 groundwater stress metrics are commonly used due to their ease of computation and low data requirements hora 2022 one of the most widely used stress metrics is the gf introduced by gleeson et al 2012 see nayyeri et al 2021 for references the gf explicitly includes environmental flows and a user friendly representation of the area required to sustain groundwater use and gdes its main disadvantage is underestimating stress levels when groundwater quality issues are observed to address the latter kourgialas et al 2018 presented a modified gf metric to account for quality aspects recently akbar et al 2022 reviewed fifteen metrics to calculate groundwater stress scarcity and sustainability the gf metric received the highest score across all metrics analysed based on five criteria i e tractability sophistication scientific robustness transparency and extendibility used for comparison groundwater sustainability can be defined as the beneficial use and development of groundwater to support present and future generations while ensuring that unacceptable environmental economic and social consequences do not occur akbar et al 2022 alley et al 1999 alley and leake 2004 anderson 2014 huang et al 2022 majidipour et al 2021 mays 2013 pandey et al 2011 van der gun 2021 velis et al 2017 groundwater sustainability therefore suggests the idea of maintaining a state of a groundwater system over an indefinite period van der gun 2021 more recently elshall et al 2020 and gleeson et al 2020 converged into a revised definition of groundwater sustainability as maintaining long term dynamically stable storage and flow of high quality groundwater using inclusive equitable and long term governance and management this definition explicitly incorporates the idea of proper management and governance to address the co evolution of groundwater systems social and biophysical state milman and macdonald 2020 it seems therefore reasonable to account for the aquifer performance e g natural groundwater system and infrastructure as well as management e g institutional and socioeconomic aspects when evaluating groundwater sustainability elshall et al 2020 multiple metrics exist to assess groundwater sustainability with no clear preference in the literature alexakis 2021 borji et al 2018 bui et al 2019 molina et al 2012 pandey et al 2011 samani 2021 senent aparicio et al 2015 singh and bhakar 2021 thomas 2019 thomas et al 2017 wada and bierkens 2014 wang et al 2020 most of these metrics assess groundwater sustainability from an aquifer performance perspective elshall et al 2020 whereas only a handful include governance management aspects jia et al 2019 molina et al 2012 pandey et al 2011 senent aparicio et al 2015 the latter is due primarily to the substantial data needed in the sustainability assessment in this work we explore the concepts of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability using the main alluvial aquifers of the murray darling basin mdb australia as a case study the relevance of the mdb is reflected in the substantial literature researching environmental socioeconomic hydrological and water management aspects in the last decades and summarised in recent reviews hart et al 2020a leblanc et al 2012 ross 2012 stewardson et al 2021 g r walker et al 2020 g walker et al 2020 williams 2011 mdba 2020a however a regional basin scale analysis on the main alluvial aquifers of the mdb anchored on the concepts of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability is currently missing to address this issue we analysed long term groundwater level trends metered groundwater usage groundwater salinity storage volumes recharge rates aquifers buffering capacity to absorb changes in recharge rates and the occurrence and diversity of gdes our work aims to provide a systemic overview of the alluvial aquifers of the mdb anchored in concepts of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability to identify potential opportunities to improve groundwater management to achieve this we combine three lines of evidence encompassing the ideas of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability a long term trend analysis of groundwater levels in more than 910 observation bores b calculation of the gf considering both groundwater quantity gleeson et al 2012 and quality salinity kourgialas et al 2018 aspects and c an explicit comparison among groundwater management units termed sustainable diversion limits sdl resource units regarding the resource size groundwater usage storage buffering capacity to recharge changes and the presence and diversity of gdes the novelty of our work rests upon the integrated assessment of these three independent lines of evidence to identify potential sdl areas where considerations of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability are required for future groundwater management additionally we contribute to closing the research gap in analysing these concepts in alluvial systems we also improve on the works by barron et al 2011 and currie et al 2010 to account for the occurrence and diversity of gdes in the alluvial aquifers of the mdb finally we assess groundwater sustainability by explicitly comparing groundwater sdls thus aligning with the most recent definition proposed in the literature elshall et al 2020 gleeson et al 2020 the article is organised as follows section 2 describes the eight main alluvial aquifers of the mdb and the three step methodological framework applied results are presented in section 3 followed by a discussion in section 4 and concluding remarks section 5 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the murray darling basin mdb covers an area of over one million square kilometres ca 14 of australia s continental territory supporting three quarters of australia s irrigated agriculture and contributing to over a third of the nation s agricultural production being such a large area the climate varies greatly from sub tropical in the north to semi arid in the south and west and to alpine in the southeast rainfall and evaporation vary with a distinct east west rainfall gradient from high to low annual averages of around 1500 300 mm crosbie et al 2010 there are four main groundwater systems in the mdb fig 1 surficial sediments with unconsolidated sedimentary plain and alluvial aquifers where most extraction occurs tertiary limestone aquifers throughout the western mdb underlying and outcropping fractured and consolidated rock and the mesozoic sediments of the great artesian basin gab ross 2012 stewardson et al 2021 walker et al 2020a 2020b wang et al 2018 this study focussed on the mdb s eight main alluvial aquifer systems from which nearly 75 of groundwater extraction in the basin occurs walker et al 2020a 2020b the study was conducted and reported results at the groundwater sdl scale these are reporting areas that reflect different aquifer characteristics levels of management and knowledge of the groundwater resources across the mdb of the total 79 groundwater sdl areas in the mdb 22 representing the main alluvial aquifer systems within the basin were analysed see fig 1 and table 1 2 2 conceptual framework fig 2 shows the conceptual framework implemented in this work we embraced the concepts of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability by merging three lines of evidence a long term trend analysis of groundwater levels b insights on groundwater stress and c a systematic comparison among the groundwater sdl management units each line of evidence used a series of groundwater indicators as proxies for resilience stress and sustainability it is worth noting that the main objective was to obtain a basin scale perspective therefore this work does not discuss the analysis of localised hotspots in specific management zones in the following we briefly explain each of these steps 2 2 1 trends in groundwater levels of alluvial aquifers we built upon the long term trend analysis on groundwater levels for the alluvial aquifers of the mdb described in fu et al 2022a to frame the analysis of groundwater resilience around ideas by de la hera portillo 2021 trend analysis was performed for 910 observation bores with at least two annual groundwater level measurements from 1971 to 2021 fig 1 data on the depth to standing water level dtw was accessed from the national groundwater information system ngis v1 7 0 updated in july 2021 out of the 22 groundwater sdls analysed see table 1 only 14 fulfilled the following criterion at least two annual measurements for 40 years three trend analysis methods namely kendall sen s slope hirsch et al 1982 linear slope and two period comparison innovative trend analysis ita dong et al 2020 şen 2012 were applied to the annual minimum maximum and average dtw to ensure the robustness of the analysis the reader is referred to fu et al 2022a for details on the trend analysis methods basin scale average long term trends for dtw were obtained for each groundwater sdl and a series of statistics e g mean trends max trends no of wells showing statistically significant trends groundwater depletion rate were calculated to identify a subset of sdls showing groundwater resilience issues 2 2 2 groundwater footprint stress the groundwater footprint gf was calculated as gleeson et al 2012 1 gf a c r e where a is the areal extent of the region of interest e g aquifer management area l2 c is the annual groundwater abstraction use l3 t r is the annual recharge rate l3 t and e is the groundwater contribution to environmental streamflow l3 t gleeson et al 2012 and mahdavi 2021 suggest alternative ways to calculate e for example hydro ecological studies direct measurements of springs hydrological modelling results expert elicitation judgement expressed as a fraction of recharge or as a low flow statistic e g q95 q90 qavg as defined by smakhtin et al 2004 groundwater contribution to environmental streamflow e was obtained from either 1 available modelling results mdba 2020a 2 reports describing groundwater contributions to streamflow nsw dpie 2019a nsw dpie 2019b welsh et al 2014a 2014b 3 or by estimating the q95 q90 qavg statistics from representative gauging stations for the latter we used a spatial dataset describing the groundwater surface interactions to identify river reaches and suitable gauging stations where contributions from groundwater to streamflow are expected in gs8a and gs8c vic delwp 2020 see fig 1 2 2 2 1 salinity and groundwater stress we included groundwater quality aspects using a revised version of the gf proposed by kourgialas et al 2018 and defined as 2 igf gf 1 n cf 1 a 1 a cf 2 a 2 a cf n a n a where gf is defined in equation 1 n is the number of contaminants in the aquifer system cf 1 n is a factor for contaminant j with j 1 n with cf j equal to 1 if the contaminant is present or above a threshold and zero otherwise a 1 n is the extent of the contaminated area and a is the areal extent of the region of interest we used groundwater salinity data from 12 513 observation bores from the ngis to calculate igf in the 22 groundwater sdl management units analysed table 1 the upper and lower two percent of salinity data were removed for data quality assurance to filter out extreme values from the remaining data the 95th percentile salinity value was calculated for each bore for use in spatial interpolation a summary of the salinity data is given in table 1 there were no salinity data in the upper gwydir gs43 sparse in the lower murrumbidgee shallow alluvium gs28a and poorly distributed across the lower murray shallow alluvium gs27a these sdl areas were therefore excluded from spatial interpolation interpolation across the border rivers alluvium sdl areas gs32 33 54 included 36 bores in total although they were unevenly distributed a range of kriging interpolation models and parameter combinations were tested to create prediction surfaces of salinity across sdl areas from bore data model fit was assessed using cross validation the semi variogram model and parameter combination that minimised root mean square error rmse was selected a separate kriging model was applied in the shepparton irrigation region sir gs8a as it overlaps and has a variable hydraulic connection with the underlying sedimentary plain gs8c kriging model performance is summarised in table 1 continuous predicted values were contoured into salinity classes tds mg l following the recharge risk assessment method rram described in mdba 2020a 1 fresh 1500 mg l 2 brackish 1500 3000 mg l 3 saline 3000 14 000 mg l and 4 highly saline 14 000 mg l the total areas of these salinity classes within each groundwater sdl were used as inputs to calculate igf in eq 2 2 2 3 aquifer development and responsiveness groundwater sustainability is a complex concept with no simple metric to assess it unambiguously van der gun 2021 in this work we embraced the idea by elshall et al 2020 suggesting that sustainability should be assessed from both aquifer performance and management perspectives to achieve this we employed modified versions of indicators reflecting aquifer development and responsiveness proposed by barron et al 2011 and currie et al 2010 to compare different aspects such as storage volumes current and allowable groundwater use recharge rates occurrence and diversity of gdes and buffering capacity storage proportional to recharge across groundwater management units the indicators proposed are defined as follows 3 development sdl i d i actual gw use i max actual gw use i i 1 n sdl i max sdl i i 1 n f gde i 4 responsiveness sdl i re i actual gw use i sdl i f r s i where i i 1 22 is the i th groundwater sdl management unit n 22 is the total number of sdl resource units actual gw use ml y represents metered groundwater usage reported for the period 2012 2019 for the i th groundwater sdl sdl i represents the long term average groundwater sustainable diversion limit ml y associated with i th sdl f gde i represents a factor accounting for gde presence and diversity in the i th sdl and f r s i is a factor reflecting the buffering capacity to absorb changes in recharge rates r with respect to storage capacity s of the i th sdl both indicators can be combined to obtain a numerical ranking following the standardisation process described in appendix a barron et al 2011 we employed a revised method to rank groundwater management units based on an ordination approach barron et al 2011 as follows developed aquifer systems low responsiveness and high development scores responsive aquifer systems low development and high responsiveness scores and relevant aquifer systems high development and high responsiveness scores 2 2 3 1 occurrence and diversity of groundwater dependent ecosystems f gde in this work we improved on the calculation of f gde i in eq 3 currie et al 2010 barron et al 2011 by using the latest spatial data available from the gde atlas v 2019 published by the australian bureau of meteorology bom http www bom gov au water groundwater gde the gde atlas contains spatial information on aspects such as gde potential unknown low moderate high potential of interacting with groundwater gde ecotypes eco hydrogeological zones and specific areal extents this information was used to refine the f gde i factor to obtain a more robust and representative index eq 3 to achieve this we grouped aquatic gdes based on ecotype wetland river spring and eco hydrogeological zones resulting in 26 classes for aquatic gdes terrestrial gdes one vegetation ecotype class were grouped according to sub ecotype resulting in 476 classes we then adapted two widely used diversity indices namely shannon and simpson diversity indices gorelick 2006 spellerberg and fedor 2003 to use class areas instead of species counts within each groundwater sdl these diversity indices were calculated on filtered gde data to exclude areas defined as low or unknown gde potential for connection to groundwater they were weighted by the ratio between the gde area and the total sdl area areagde areasdl to account for the spatial relevance of gdes 2 2 3 2 recharge buffering capacity f r s the aquifer responsiveness indicator eq 4 combines the resource size the current level of groundwater use and the aquifer s capacity to buffer potential changes in recharge rates the factor f r s i barron et al 2011 is expressed as a membership function as follows 5 f r s 0 9 0 3 0 01 high r s moderate r s low r s to define the three classes high moderate and low r s ratios we used recharge estimates reported in the literature and average values of standing water levels the base level of the aquifer planar areas aquifer types and estimates of porosity for storage calculations dnrme 2018 mcneil et al 2018 mdba 2020a nsw dpi 2019b nsw dpi 2018c nsw dpi 2018b nsw dpi 2018a nsw dpi 2019a nsw dpie 2019a ogia 2016 water 2015 welsh et al 2014 welsh et al 2014 when alluvial depth was unavailable we used the depth of the regolith digital product wilford et al 2018 3 results 3 1 groundwater level trends in alluvial aquifers of the mdb up to 95 of the 910 observation bores used in the analysis showed deepening trends with 87 being statistically significant at an α 0 05 level there is therefore an overall deepening trend of dtw for the mdb alluvial aquifers during the last 50 years 1971 2021 regardless of annual statistic mean minimum and maximum dtw and the trend detection method used non parametric kendall test linear regression and two period comparison fu et al 2022 fig 3 shows sdl averaged trends for two groundwater sdls showing some of the most substantial decreasing trends across the alluvial aquifers this figure shows marked decreasing trends underlying cycles of recharge discharge at the sdl scale and substantial variation across observations grey dots used to estimate these trends sdl scale trends and the impact of large scale climate events such as the millennium drought are more pronounced in specific groundwater sdls see figure s 1 in the supplementary material table 2 shows the trend magnitudes sen s slope from the non parametric kendall s test hirsch et al 1982 for the average annual dtw other methods linear slope and ita and statistics minimum and maximum dtw showed similar results only 14 groundwater sdls fulfilled the criteria for data selection results showed that mean trend magnitudes vary between 0 03 m y and 0 19 m y with an average trend across sdls equal to 0 11 m y sdls showing above average deepening trends for mean annual dtw were identified as lower namoi alluvium gs29 lower murrumbidgee deep alluvium gs28b upper namoi alluvium gs47 goulburn murray sedimentary plain gs8c upper condamine alluvium cca gs64a lower gwydir alluvium gs24 and mid murrumbidgee alluvium gs31 except for gs28b 81 and gs24 73 groundwater sdls mentioned above show statistically significant decreasing trends in more than 90 of the observation bores in addition the long term mean trend for each sdl was used to estimate the groundwater depletion rate defined as the ratio between storage and net changes in storage richey et al 2015a these values are a worst case scenario as they represent the mean trend applied over the whole sdl area and are therefore only referential for the same sdls mentioned above except for gs8c 282 years we observe depletion rates below 125 years with lower values for upper and lower namoi alluvium gs29 ad gs47 interestingly gs44 and gs64b also show more than 90 of observation wells with statistically significant decreasing trends less than 100 years for the depletion rate and above average maximum trends they show below average mean trends indicating most likely the occurrence of hot spots with localised and intensive groundwater exploitation based on richey et al 2015a and de la hera portillo et al 2021 it is argued that groundwater sdls showing above average mean decreasing trends 90 of observation wells with statistically significant decreasing trends and low values of depletion rate are less resilient to long term changes and in reaching a new dynamic equilibrium state 3 2 groundwater footprint stress in alluvial aquifers of the mdb conceptually the gf represents the ratio between groundwater outputs inputs for a given area a table 3 shows the results for the gf and stress calculations when considering average metered groundwater usage for the period 2012 2019 we identified three groundwater sdls under stress gf a 1 lower namoi gs29 upper macquarie alluvium gs45 and upper namoi alluvium gs47 the main factors driving stress levels are groundwater usage in the namoi alluvium gs29 and gs47 rassam et al 2013 and groundwater contribution to environmental streamflow in the upper macquarie alluvium gs45 mdba 2020a the lower lachlan alluvium gs25 and lower gwydir alluvium gs24 show gf a ratios closer to 1 thus indicating that groundwater outputs are similar to the main inputs to the system to account for groundwater quality we used the igf section 2 2 2 and recalculated stress levels for different salinity classes fig 4 shows the spatial interpolation of the 95th percentile salinity values across all groundwater management units sdls and the corresponding salinity class areas used to calculate igf on average 72 of the groundwater sdl areas covering the alluvial aquifers are classified as freshwater 54 or brackish 18 groundwater whereas 25 is classified as saline highly saline areas are identified around the lower sections of the murray river in the gs8c gs27b and a localised area of the shepparton irrigation region gs8a fig 4 also shows that most of the freshwater areas 80 of the total sdl area concentrate around the narrow alluvial deposits located towards the uplands of the mdb and in the lower gwydir alluvium gs24 for the condamine alluvium gs64a fresh groundwater aligns well with the condamine river similarly alluvial aquifers in the mdb s extensive alluvial plains show freshwater pockets closely aligned with these regions main rivers e g lachlan gs25 murrumbidgee gs31 and gs28b and murray gs27b rivers this would suggest strong connections between surface water and groundwater for these alluvial aquifers extensive brackish and saline groundwater areas concentrate towards the lower sections of the sdl areas e g gs29 gs28b gs27b gs8c when including different salinity class areas in the calculation of the gf we observe substantial increases in stress levels igf in table 3 for example for groundwater sdls initially identified gs29 gs45 and gs47 stress levels increase between 60 and 160 whereas for lower lachlan gs25 a 3 4 fold increase in stress levels is observed similarly when using freshwater areas only in the calculation of groundwater stress i e discounting highly saline saline and brackish groundwater areas in the alluvial aquifers other groundwater sdls are identified under stress namely lower macquarie gs26 lower murrumbidgee deep gs28b upper condamine alluvium gs64a and gs64b and goulburn murray sedimentary plain gs8c the latter showing the largest 3 4 fold increase in the stress metric fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of the groundwater stress metric gf a at the sdl scale fig 5a shows the stress metric with no account for salinity data baseline for comparison this figure assumes all areas extent contributes to the calculation of the stress metric fig 5b accounts for areas defined as highly saline to calculate igf gs8a gs8c and gs27b these areas however are not extensive enough to move the groundwater stress metric igf a to values larger than one and no changes with respect to the baseline panel a are observed fig 5c accounts for highly saline and saline groundwater areas to calculate igf both lower lachlan alluvium gs25 and lower murrumbidgee deep alluvium gs28b move into stress conditions igf a 1 given the increase in areas falling under this salinity class 57 and 48 of total sdl area respectively at the same time lower gwydir alluvium gs24 lower macquarie alluvium gs26 and goulburn murray sedimentary plan gs8c show values greater than 0 8 for igf a finally fig 5d accounts for highly saline saline and brackish groundwater areas for this case a few sdls showing groundwater stress are added to the previous group lower macquarie alluvium gs26 upper condamine alluvium cca gs64a upper condamine alluvium tributaries gs64b and goulburn murray sedimentary plan gs8c it is interesting to note the case of the goulburn murray shepparton irrigation region gs8a which is below stress levels after accounting for highly saline saline and brackish groundwater areas given the low groundwater use and the substantial recharge and area considered in the calculation of the gf 3 3 3 3 development and responsiveness scores in the alluvial aquifers of the mdb fig 6 shows the total gde area and moderate to high gde potential areas for each groundwater sdl obtained from the gde atlas and used for calculating the f gde factor in eq 3 some sdls e g gs25 gs28a have substantial areas classified as gdes but these areas show limited areal extent for moderate to high gde potential for the alluvial aquifers moderate to high gde potential areas fluctuate between 3 and 29 of the total groundwater sdl areas analysed interestingly in some cases most of the gde area shows a documented moderate to high potential of interacting with groundwater e g gs43 gs64a gs64b gs8a gs8b thus the f gde calculation is anticipated to be robust across the proposed area weighting schemes fig 7 shows the calculation of f gde based on the normalised simpson dn and shannon hn diversity indices using gde areas presented in fig 6 this figure shows that trends for both diversity indices are similar when using all gdes e g dn vs hn or when diversity indices are weighted by the areal ratio areagde areasdl dan vs han interestingly there is more variability in f gde when an area weighted factor is implemented although not shown here there is also substantial variation in the diversity indices when only gde areas of moderate to high potential are considered fig 7 also shows that for certain groundwater sdls e g gs26 gs64a gs64b gs8a and gs8c the gde richness captured in the f gde metric e g dn is diluted when the diversity metric is weighted by the area e g dan this suggests that the relevance of gde areas with regard to the total groundwater sdl area might impact the calculation of the aquifer development score eq 3 this sensitivity must be accounted for when combining development and responsiveness scores fig 8 shows the f r s factor calculated for all groundwater sdls resource units in this figure a high recharge to storage ratio suggests higher sensitivity as there will be minimal buffering capacity in the aquifer to absorb changes in recharge in contrast lower sensitivity will be observed in the opposite situation currie et al 2010 higher values for the f r s factor are therefore observed for small groundwater sdls such as the upper macquarie alluvium gs45 upper gwydir alluvium gs43 and namoi tributary alluvium gs48 see table 1 in contrast lower values are associated with larger alluvial systems such as lower murray deep alluvium gs27b and lower lachlan alluvium gs25 to assess the sensitivity in estimating f gde fig 9 shows the development responsiveness and numerical relevance scores using different weighting schemes for the simpson s diversity index sdi similar results are obtained using shannon s diversity index and therefore they are omitted here it is worth noting that the responsiveness score remains unchanged as changes in f gde only impact the development and numerical relevance scores when weighing the simpson diversity indices by the gde area d vs da or by the moderate to high potential gde area i e da vs daf to calculate f gde discrepancies arise in the development score e g gs8c gs64a gs64b gs24 this is expected as these groundwater sdls have less than 8 of the total area defined as gdes similarly when the diversity index is weighted by the gde areas of moderate to high potential gs25 gs8c gs8a and gs26 show the largest fluctuations in the development score sensitivities in the numerical relevance score size of the symbol in fig 9 are less relevant thus indicating robust values across groundwater sdls when combining the development and responsiveness scores fig 9 also shows the ordination approach defined as coloured regions in the panels of the figure i e blue region high development and low responsiveness scores green region high responsiveness and low development scores and yellow region high development and high responsiveness scores following barron et al 2011 we defined the top 10 out of 22 groundwater sdls as cut off values to determine the coloured regions of the ordination approach upper macquarie gs45 shows a high responsiveness score given a high f r s factor 0 9 and b average annual groundwater use 16 643 ml y closely approaching the sustainable diversion limit value of 17 900 ml y goulburn murray sedimentary plain gs8c and the shepparton irrigation region gs8a show high development scores this changes when weighting the diversity index d by gde area da positioning lower lachlan gs25 at the top and upper namoi gs47 second this is explained by the large ratio of groundwater extraction of gs25 and gs47 with respect to the largest groundwater extraction across all groundwater sdls and the changes in f gde observed in gs8a and gs8c when weighting the diversity index by gde area see fig 7 notably groundwater sdls in the blue region dominate the numerical relevance score bubble size in contrast groundwater sdls showing high responsiveness scores green region have little impact on the numerical relevance score bubble size the development score thus drives the numerical relevance score however groundwater sdls with a high numerical relevance score small bubble size might not fall in the yellow area defined by the ordination approach following the ordination approach two groundwater sdls gs8a and gs31 were consistently identified as showing high development and responsiveness scores for the different weighting schemes shown in fig 9 for gs8a goulburn murray shepparton irrigation region this is mainly driven by the ratio between sdlgs8a 244 100 ml y and sdlmax gs28b 273 600 ml y to calculate the development score eq 3 this ratio reflects the size of the sustainably exploitable resource in gs8a with respect to the largest groundwater sdl in the dataset gs28b it is worth noting that the average groundwater use metered in gs8a for 2012 2019 represents only 23 of its sustainable diversion limit sdlgs8a 244 100 ml y for gs31 mid murrumbidgee this is mainly driven by the ratio between metered groundwater use for the period 2012 2019 38 957 ml y and the sdlgs31 53 500 ml y used to calculate the responsiveness score eq 4 combined with a moderate r s ratio as shown in fig 8 3 4 aspects of resilience stress and sustainability of alluvial aquifers of the mdb fig 10 summarises the standardised groundwater based indicators used as proxies for analysing groundwater resilience stress and sustainability aspects results show eleven groundwater sdls where resilience stress or sustainability issues have been identified lower gwydir alluvium gs24 lower lachlan alluvium gs25 lower murrumbidgee deep alluvium gs28b lower namoi alluvium gs29 mid murrumbidgee alluvium gs31 upper lachlan alluvium gs44 upper macquarie alluvium gs45 upper namoi alluvium gs47 upper condamine alluvium cca gs64a goulburn murray shepparton irrigation region gs8a and goulburn murray sedimentary plain gs8c out of these groundwater sdls evidence indicates that stress resilience and potential sustainability issues are simultaneously identified for the namoi alluvial aquifer comprising gs29 and gs47 in contrast the mid murrumbidgee alluvial aquifer gs31 shows resilience and sustainability issues for the case of the upper condamine alluvium gs64a lower murrumbidgee deep gs28b as well as the goulburn murray sedimentary plain gs8c evidence suggests groundwater management units experience resilience issues due to declining groundwater levels and high depletion rates potential stress issues when considering salinity levels in groundwater stress calculations and potential sustainability issues when presence and diversity of gdes are considered upper macquarie gs45 shows stress issues mainly driven by the reported contribution from groundwater to streamflow mdba 2020a in contrast upper lachlan gs44 shows resilience issues driven by the number of wells showing statistically significant declining trends and high depletion rates and potential sustainability issues driven by the aquifer development score a similar pattern is observed for gs8a but with strong evidence from the development score and ordination approach indicating sustainability issues lower gwydir gs24 and lower lachlan gs25 show above average values for all indicators across all sdls used as proxies to analyse resilience stress and sustainability except for lower lachlan gs25 stress issues when considering groundwater salinity all other indicators are similar for these two groundwater sdls thus indicating no clear evidence of specific resilience stress or sustainability issues similarly emerging stress and sustainability issues have been identified for lower macquarie alluvium gs26 when groundwater salinity and the occurrence and diversity of gdes are considered in contrast for the upper condamine alluvium tributaries gs64b potential resilience issues have been identified localised highest maximum trend values across sdls 4 discussion we proposed an indicator based framework anchored in groundwater resilience stress and sustainability to assess the main alluvial aquifers of the mdb systemically numerous groundwater related indicators to inform decision making for sustainable management have been proposed in the literature lavapuro et al 2008 pires et al 2017 unesco ihp 2011 vrba et al 2007 2006 research suggests that groundwater stress metrics are the most commonly used due to simplicity and low data requirements hora 2022 whereas no specific nor dominant groundwater resilience or sustainability indicators are identified van der gun 2021 see supplementary material the indicators used in this work are fit for purpose measurable observable cover groundwater quantity and quality occurrence and diversity of gdes and aquifer performance aspects they are therefore well aligned with principles on groundwater indicator selection suggested by lavapuro et al 2008 they are also assessed at relevant management units i e groundwater sdl and are therefore closely aligned with recent definitions for groundwater sustainability elshall et al 2020 gleeson et al 2020 similarly the three lines of evidence and proxies used for groundwater resilience stress and sustainability are well aligned with the seven criteria proposed by liverman et al 1988 to define sustainability indicators singh and bhakar 2021 it can be argued that the indicators employed in this work are not comprehensive of each individual concept resilience stress sustainability we accept the premise that different aspects of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability might be intermingled in the indicators used in this framework for example the development and responsiveness scores barron et al 2011 currie et al 2010 used as proxies for groundwater sustainability consider aspects related to the occurrence and diversity of gdes ratios between groundwater use and availability sensitivity to changes in recharge and groundwater storage reserves all elements that can well be related to the ideas of groundwater stress richey 2014 richey et al 2015b and or resilience de la hera portillo et al 2021 2020 we argue that the value of the framework implemented in this work rests upon simultaneously examining the three lines of evidence rather than exploring the concepts of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability in isolation as tabarmayeh et al 2022 suggested an isolated analysis might result in conflicting results and erroneous policy recommendations we agree with preda et al 2014 that indicator based approaches are tools for problem identification and not for problem solving and can be used to bridge academic work and political needs which might facilitate the interactions between science policy and practice milman and macdonald 2020 however they might also oversimplify complex groundwater systems thus amplifying the risk of groundwater mismanagement this again confirms the value of analysing resilience stress and sustainability aspects simultaneously we embraced de la hera portillo et al 2021 idea that for heavily exploited aquifers the resilience analysis makes sense within a framework identifying the groundwater system s trend towards a new dynamic equilibrium if any groundwater resilience is not a single number but an emergent and contextual property of the groundwater system analysed de la hera portillo et al 2021 patterns observed from long term trend analysis suggest that for a majority ca 85 of the observation bores in the alluvial aquifers of the mdb analysed by fu et al 2022a a persistent declining trend in groundwater levels is observed for the period 1971 2021 results also show large proportions of observation bores showing statistically significant deepening trends and relatively high aquifer depletion rates particularly in those groundwater sdls experiencing continued exploitation the latter provides the foundation to identify resilience issues in those groundwater sdls with above average declining trends in groundwater levels across the mdb these metrics allow for an impartial comparison across groundwater sdls and can be further used to assess reliability resilience and vulnerability rrv sandoval solis et al 2011 once management interventions are implemented we acknowledge that the scale of the analysis groundwater sdl might not be representative of local circumstances reflecting the presence of confining conditions water table vs piezometric heads or flood recharge which might result in stable or even localised rising groundwater levels clark 2022 giambastiani and kelly 2010 kelly et al 2014 as mentioned in section 1 our objective is to provide a regional scale assessment across all main alluvial aquifers of the mdb thus evaluating local conditions or hotspots within groundwater sdls or differences between changes in pressure head and water table conditions is beyond the scope of this work groundwater stress estimated through the gf is driven by the ratio between groundwater outputs and inputs including the contributions from groundwater to environmental streamflow gleeson et al 2012 in this regard some authors acknowledge that groundwater stress analyses should be linked to fluctuations in groundwater storage assessments richey et al 2015a b taylor 2009 although the gf does not explicitly account for this in the stress calculation our proposed framework explicitly considers changes in storage in time and spatially through the groundwater trend analysis and the calculation of the responsiveness score i e f r s the namoi alluvium gs29 and gs47 shows the highest stress levels which reflects the comparatively high groundwater consumption for irrigation purposes rassam et al 2013 whereas high values of groundwater contribution to streamflows reported by mdba 2020a for the upper macquarie alluvium gs47 drive the gf in that sdl this highlights an important advantage of using the gf to assess groundwater stress identifying the factors driving groundwater stress chen et al 2020 according to chen et al 2020 the stress levels observed in these groundwater sdls suggest mild over exploitation the incorporation of groundwater salinity increased the stress index igf a for sdl areas with large proportions of saline and brackish water e g goulburn murray sp and sir and had little effect on areas dominated by fresh groundwater table 3 and fig 5 groundwater salinity and soil salinisation in the mdb especially in the mid and lower parts of the basin are well documented issues hart et al 2020b mdba 2015 much of the basin particularly the southern basin has naturally saline groundwater due to millennia of deposition weathering and a marine geological history walker and prosser 2021 however two centuries of deep rooted vegetation clearance for cropping and grazing and expansion of irrigated land have led to groundwater mounding landscape salinisation and discharge of saline groundwater to streams and rivers that have been associated with losses of native vegetation and agricultural production hart et al 2020b these issues have necessitated active management programs such as salt interception schemes over the past few decades to lower the water table to prevent further damage restore landscapes and riverine ecosystems and reduce salt input to rivers mdba 2015 there are 14 salt interception schemes operating mainly adjacent to the murray river that are essential to achieving salinity reduction targets mdba 2015 two are in the proximity of the goulburn murray gs8c highly saline area identified in fig 4 and the rest are downstream of the main alluvial sdl areas in this study in the shepparton irrigation region gs8a active management of water table heights through additional pumping is applied to reduce risks of soil salinisation induced through irrigation mdba 2020a by incorporating salinity in the groundwater stress index the current study has highlighted that along with extraction groundwater quality risks also threaten the long term sustainability of groundwater resources for environmental and consumptive purposes in critical parts of the mdb there is a rich literature on methods to assess groundwater sustainability and as a result some degree of ambiguity regarding assessment metrics chen et al 2015 van der gun 2021 we embraced the ideas by elshall et al 2020 and gleeson et al 2020 that sustainability should be assessed with respect to aquifer performance and management governance aspects first data on recharge storage groundwater use groundwater sustainable diversion limits presence and diversity of gdes and buffering capacity of groundwater sdl resource units were considered these aspects align well with system properties and current stresses driving sustainability van der gun 2021 and the objectives of sustainability assessments lambán et al 2011 despite some ambiguity in the development score due to alternative methods for calculating the f gde factor the ordination approach to identify groundwater sdls was robust one advantage of the metrics employed as a proxy for sustainability development and responsiveness is identifying the main factors driving the corresponding scores this further supports the advantage of assessing multiple lines of evidence in the proposed framework majidipour et al 2021 at the same time data requirements are relatively modest compared to other proposed frameworks used to assess groundwater sustainability chen et al 2015 hosseini et al 2019 majidipour et al 2021 pandey et al 2011 samani 2021 some degree of uncertainty might be expected in our results and analysis we tried minimising this by accessing quality controlled and officially reported datasets although this does not guarantee error free datasets 5 conclusions long term trend analysis indicates that nine groundwater sdls show above average declining trends in groundwater levels a high number of observation bores showing statistically significant declining trends and high depletion rates thus pointing towards groundwater resilience issues to achieve a new equilibrium stage groundwater footprint assessment indicates that three groundwater sdls are under stress mainly driven by groundwater extraction and contributions to environmental streamflow including data on groundwater salinity in the assessment adds substantial pressure to the groundwater sdls groundwater sustainability assessment shows that two groundwater sdls can be regarded as relevant following the ordination approach based on the development and responsiveness scores despite some sensitivity observed by using different gde diversity metrics the ordination approach was robust overall eleven out of 22 groundwater sdls were identified as having resilience stress or sustainability issues across the main alluvial aquifers of the mdb the namoi alluvium gs29 and gs47 shows simultaneous signs of resilience stress and potential sustainability issues whereas mid murrumbidgee gs31 shows resilience and sustainability issues the upper condamine alluvium gs64a lower murrumbidgee deep gs28b and goulburn murray sedimentary plains gs8c show signs of resilience issues potential stress issues when considering groundwater salinity and potential sustainability issues due to the presence and diversity of gdes upper macquarie gs45 shows stress driven by groundwater contributions to streamflow in contrast upper lachlan gs44 shows resilience issues driven by declining trends and high depletion rates and potential sustainability issues driven by the aquifer development score a similar pattern is observed for gs8a with stronger evidence indicating sustainability issues despite having above average values across all indicators lower gwydir gs24 and lower lachlan gs25 show no clear evidence of specific resilience stress or sustainability issues the exception is for lower lachlan gs25 when considering groundwater salinity two other specific groundwater management units show signs of emergent resilience gs64b or sustainability issues gs26 due to localised maximum declining trends and the presence and diversity of gdes in this work we showed the value of simultaneously examining aspects related to groundwater resilience stress and sustainability rather than analysing each aspect in isolation which ultimately might result in biased and or conflicting results this framework can help guide efforts to improve groundwater management in those areas identified by addressing specific resilience stress and sustainability issues and providing guidance to focus efforts on priority regions for future development

7686,study region main alluvial aquifers of the murray darling basin mdb australia study focus around 75 of total metered groundwater use within australia s murray darling basin mdb arguably the nation s most important food and fibre production region is extracted from eight main alluvial aquifer systems to date regional scale analyses of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability for the region have not been completed this study provides a systemic overview of the main alluvial systems anchored in these concepts to achieve this we combined three lines of evidence encompassing a long term trend analysis of groundwater levels b calculation of groundwater footprint indices considering volume and quality and c an explicit comparison of groundwater management areas in terms of groundwater usage sustainable use storage volumes presence and diversity of groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes and buffering capacity to absorb changes in recharge rates new hydrological insights for the region the novelty of our work rests upon an integrated assessment of these three lines of evidence incorporating twelve different metrics to prioritise future groundwater management efforts results indicate that eleven out of twenty two groundwater management areas show resilience stress and or sustainability issues and a further two with emergent issues efforts to improve our understanding and management of these key groundwater resources would be most effective if focussed on these areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater resilience groundwater stress groundwater footprint groundwater sustainability indicator based assessment mdb data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is the largest freshwater resource across the globe nearly 50 of drinking water and 43 of irrigation water is sourced from aquifers elshall et al 2020 around the world the continued use of groundwater has resulted in problems such as declining groundwater levels land subsidence groundwater quality deterioration decrease or loss of streamflow springs and threats to groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes at different scales anderson 2014 de graaf et al 2019 martinsen et al 2022 milman and macdonald 2020 despite these challenges due to the buffering effect of high storage volumes relative to recharge some groundwater systems can offer a more robust and resilient supply compared with surface water systems which are generally more directly impacted by increased climate variability kundzewicz and döll 2009 thomas et al 2017 however groundwater systems with limited storage e g shallow narrow aquifers and those with strong surface water connections are vulnerable and sensitive to climate variability change kundzewicz and döll 2009 research on the concepts of aquifer vulnerability sensitivity rine et al 2006 watson et al 2020 and potential mukherjee et al 2012 has been primarily dominated by methods assessing pollution risk and vulnerability butler 2010 rine et al 2006 only recently concepts such as groundwater resilience stress and sustainability have received a surge of attention to describing groundwater resources under a systemic lens akbar et al 2022 de la hera portillo et al 2021 elshall et al 2020 gleeson et al 2012 2020 majidipour et al 2021 richey et al 2015b except for akbar et al 2022 who simultaneously analyse the concepts of groundwater scarcity stress and sustainability using index based assessment previous research has focused mainly on the individual assessment of these concepts these assessments have been mostly at a global scale and cover different aquifer types with only a handful of articles addressing alluvial aquifers specifically fuchs et al 2018 jianbing et al 2020 tabarmayeh et al 2022 alexakis et al 2021 samani 2021 however none of the previous research on alluvial aquifers analysed these concepts simultaneously in this work we simultaneously explored and applied the concepts of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability to a case study in the murray darlin basin mdb australia to obtain a systemic view of groundwater resources hosted in the main alluvial aquifers groundwater resilience can be defined as the ability of a groundwater system to maintain reserves and its essential functions despite major anthropogenic disturbances sharma and sharma 2006 de la hera portillo et al 2021 supply oriented definitions define it as the long term reliability of groundwater supplies balancing long term recharge and pumping rates chinnasamy et al 2018 or as the capacity to absorb variable pumping stresses under variable recharge and surface water availability fuchs et al 2018 description of groundwater storage long term pumping stresses and recharge rates and the groundwater system s functionality e g water supply support to gdes are key aspects of these definitions it can then be argued that systems with larger storage capacities are expected to be more resilient to external drivers compared to those of smaller volume chinnasamy et al 2018 macdonald et al 2011 and that groundwater storage is necessary to describe groundwater resilience richey 2014 for intensively exploited aquifers pumping stress is a major driver and therefore the resilience analysis should be framed around identifying trends towards new dynamic equilibrium stages de la hera portillo et al 2021 groundwater stress can be broadly defined as the ratio between the use and availability of groundwater resources thomas and famiglietti 2019 the ratio between the groundwater footprint gf and the aquifer area gleeson et al 2012 gleeson and wada 2013 or the ratio of total storage to the groundwater depletion rate richey et al 2015a there exists an abundant collection of methods to calculate groundwater stress supplementary material s 2 see e g mohan 2019 richey et al 2015b alley et al 2018 herbert and döll 2019 hernández espriú et al 2019 gleeson et al 2012 gleeson

conditions when driven by global scale datasets alley et al 2018 groundwater stress metrics are commonly used due to their ease of computation and low data requirements hora 2022 one of the most widely used stress metrics is the gf introduced by gleeson et al 2012 see nayyeri et al 2021 for references the gf explicitly includes environmental flows and a user friendly representation of the area required to sustain groundwater use and gdes its main disadvantage is underestimating stress levels when groundwater quality issues are observed to address the latter kourgialas et al 2018 presented a modified gf metric to account for quality aspects recently akbar et al 2022 reviewed fifteen metrics to calculate groundwater stress scarcity and sustainability the gf metric received the highest score across all metrics analysed based on five criteria i e tractability sophistication scientific robustness transparency and extendibility used for comparison groundwater sustainability can be defined as the beneficial use and development of groundwater to support present and future generations while ensuring that unacceptable environmental economic and social consequences do not occur akbar et al 2022 alley et al 1999 alley and leake 2004 anderson 2014 huang et al 2022 majidipour et al 2021 mays 2013 pandey et al 2011 van der gun 2021 velis et al 2017 groundwater sustainability therefore suggests the idea of maintaining a state of a groundwater system over an indefinite period van der gun 2021 more recently elshall et al 2020 and gleeson et al 2020 converged into a revised definition of groundwater sustainability as maintaining long term dynamically stable storage and flow of high quality groundwater using inclusive equitable and long term governance and management this definition explicitly incorporates the idea of proper management and governance to address the co evolution of groundwater systems social and biophysical state milman and macdonald 2020 it seems therefore reasonable to account for the aquifer performance e g natural groundwater system and infrastructure as well as management e g institutional and socioeconomic aspects when evaluating groundwater sustainability elshall et al 2020 multiple metrics exist to assess groundwater sustainability with no clear preference in the literature alexakis 2021 borji et al 2018 bui et al 2019

groundwater sustainability from an aquifer performance perspective elshall et al 2020 whereas only a handful include governance management aspects jia et al 2019 molina et al 2012 pandey et al 2011 senent aparicio et al 2015 the latter is due primarily to the substantial data needed in the sustainability assessment in this work we explore the concepts of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability using the main alluvial aquifers of the murray darling basin mdb australia as a case study the relevance of the mdb is reflected in the substantial literature researching environmental socioeconomic hydrological and water management aspects in the last decades and summarised in recent reviews hart et al 2020a leblanc et al 2012 ross 2012 stewardson et al 2021 g r walker et al 2020 g walker et al 2020 williams 2011 mdba 2020a however a regional basin scale analysis on the main alluvial aquifers of the mdb anchored on the concepts of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability is currently missing to address this issue we analysed long term groundwater level trends metered groundwater usage groundwater salinity storage volumes recharge rates aquifers buffering capacity to absorb changes in recharge rates and the occurrence and diversity of gdes our work aims to provide a systemic overview of the alluvial aquifers of the mdb anchored in concepts of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability to identify potential opportunities to improve groundwater management to achieve this we combine three lines of evidence encompassing the ideas of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability a long term trend analysis of groundwater levels in more than 910 observation bores b calculation of the gf considering both groundwater quantity gleeson et al 2012 and quality salinity kourgialas et al 2018 aspects and c an explicit comparison among groundwater management units termed sustainable diversion limits sdl resource units regarding the resource size groundwater usage storage buffering capacity to recharge changes and the presence and diversity of gdes the novelty of our work rests upon the integrated assessment of these three independent lines of evidence to identify potential sdl areas where considerations of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability are required for future groundwater management additionally we contribute to closing the research gap in analysing these concepts in alluvial systems we also improve on the works by barron et al 2011 and currie et al 2010 to account for the occurrence and diversity of gdes in the alluvial aquifers of the mdb finally we assess groundwater sustainability by explicitly comparing groundwater sdls thus aligning with the most recent definition proposed in the literature elshall

west rainfall gradient from high to low annual averages of around 1500 300 mm crosbie et al 2010 there are four main groundwater systems in the mdb fig 1 surficial sediments with unconsolidated sedimentary plain and alluvial aquifers where most extraction occurs tertiary limestone aquifers throughout the western mdb underlying and outcropping fractured and consolidated rock and the mesozoic sediments of the great artesian basin gab ross 2012 stewardson et al 2021 walker et al 2020a 2020b wang et al 2018 this study focussed on the mdb s eight main alluvial aquifer systems from which nearly 75 of groundwater extraction in the basin occurs walker et al 2020a 2020b the study was conducted and reported results at the groundwater sdl scale these are reporting areas that reflect different aquifer characteristics levels of management and knowledge of the groundwater resources across the mdb of the total 79 groundwater sdl areas in the mdb 22 representing the main alluvial aquifer systems within the basin were analysed see fig 1 and table 1 2 2 conceptual framework fig 2 shows the conceptual framework implemented in this work we embraced the concepts of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability by merging three lines of evidence a long term trend analysis of groundwater levels b insights on groundwater stress and c a systematic comparison among the groundwater sdl management units each line of evidence used a series of groundwater indicators as proxies for resilience stress and sustainability it is worth noting that the main objective was to obtain a basin scale perspective therefore this work does not discuss the analysis of localised hotspots in specific management zones in the following we briefly explain each of these steps 2 2 1 trends in groundwater levels of alluvial aquifers we built upon the long term trend analysis on groundwater levels for the alluvial aquifers of the mdb described in fu et al 2022a to frame the analysis of groundwater resilience around ideas by de la hera portillo 2021 trend analysis was performed for 910 observation bores with at least two annual groundwater level measurements from 1971 to 2021 fig 1 data on the depth to standing water level dtw was accessed from the national groundwater information system ngis v1 7 0 updated in july 2021 out of the 22 groundwater sdls analysed see table 1 only 14 fulfilled the following criterion at least two annual measurements for 40 years three trend analysis methods namely kendall sen s slope hirsch et al 1982 linear slope and two period comparison innovative trend analysis ita dong et al 2020 şen 2012 were applied to the annual minimum maximum and average dtw to ensure the robustness of the analysis the reader is referred to fu et al 2022a for details on the trend analysis methods basin scale average long term trends for dtw were obtained for each groundwater sdl and a series of statistics e g mean trends max trends no of wells showing statistically significant trends groundwater depletion rate were calculated to identify a subset of sdls showing groundwater resilience issues 2 2 2 groundwater footprint stress the groundwater footprint gf was calculated as gleeson et al 2012 1 gf a c r e where a is the areal extent of the region of interest e g aquifer management area l2 c is the annual groundwater abstraction use l3 t r is the annual recharge rate l3 t and e is the groundwater contribution to environmental streamflow l3 t gleeson et al 2012 and mahdavi 2021 suggest alternative ways to calculate e for example hydro ecological studies direct measurements of springs hydrological modelling results expert elicitation judgement expressed as a fraction of recharge or as a low flow statistic e g q95 q90 qavg as defined by smakhtin et al 2004 groundwater contribution to environmental streamflow e was obtained from either 1 available modelling results mdba 2020a 2 reports describing groundwater contributions to streamflow nsw dpie 2019a nsw dpie 2019b welsh et al 2014a 2014b 3 or by estimating the q95 q90 qavg statistics from representative gauging stations for the latter we used a spatial dataset describing the groundwater surface interactions to identify river reaches and suitable gauging stations where contributions from groundwater to streamflow are expected in gs8a and gs8c vic delwp 2020 see fig 1 2 2 2 1 salinity and groundwater stress we included groundwater quality aspects using a revised version of the gf proposed by kourgialas et al 2018 and defined as 2 igf gf 1 n cf 1 a 1 a cf 2 a 2 a cf n a n a where gf is defined in equation 1 n is the number of contaminants in the aquifer system cf 1 n is a factor for contaminant j with j 1 n with cf j equal to 1 if the contaminant is present or above a threshold and zero otherwise a 1 n is the extent of the contaminated area and a is the areal extent of the region of interest we used groundwater salinity data from 12 513 observation bores from the ngis to calculate igf in the 22 groundwater sdl management units analysed table 1 the upper and lower two percent of salinity data were removed for data quality assurance to filter out extreme values from the remaining data the 95th percentile salinity value was calculated for each bore for use in spatial interpolation a summary of the salinity data is given in table 1 there were no salinity data in the upper gwydir gs43 sparse in the lower murrumbidgee shallow alluvium gs28a and poorly distributed across the lower murray shallow alluvium gs27a these sdl areas were therefore excluded from spatial interpolation interpolation across the border rivers alluvium sdl areas gs32 33 54 included 36 bores in total although they were unevenly distributed a range of kriging interpolation models and parameter combinations were tested to create prediction surfaces of salinity across sdl areas from bore data model fit was assessed using cross validation the semi variogram model and parameter combination that minimised root mean square error rmse was selected a separate kriging model was applied in the shepparton irrigation region sir gs8a as it overlaps and has a variable hydraulic connection with the underlying sedimentary plain gs8c kriging model performance is summarised in table 1 continuous predicted values were contoured into salinity classes tds mg l following the recharge risk assessment method rram described in mdba 2020a 1 fresh 1500 mg l 2 brackish 1500 3000 mg l 3 saline 3000 14 000 mg l and 4 highly saline 14 000 mg l the total areas of these salinity classes within each groundwater sdl were used as inputs to calculate igf in eq 2 2 2 3 aquifer development and responsiveness groundwater sustainability is a complex concept with no simple metric to assess it unambiguously van der gun 2021 in this work we embraced the idea by elshall et al 2020 suggesting that sustainability should be assessed from both aquifer performance and management perspectives to achieve this we employed modified versions of indicators reflecting aquifer development and responsiveness proposed by barron et al 2011 and currie et al 2010 to compare different aspects such as storage volumes current and allowable groundwater use recharge rates occurrence and diversity of gdes and buffering capacity storage proportional to recharge across groundwater management units the indicators proposed are defined as follows 3 development sdl i d i actual gw use i max actual gw use i i 1 n sdl i max sdl i i 1 n f gde i 4 responsiveness sdl i re i actual gw use i sdl i f r s i where i i 1 22 is the i th groundwater sdl management unit n 22 is the total number of sdl resource units actual gw use ml y represents metered groundwater usage reported for the period 2012 2019 for the i th groundwater sdl sdl i represents the long term average groundwater sustainable diversion limit ml y associated with i th sdl f gde i represents a factor accounting for gde presence and diversity in the i th sdl and f r s i is a factor reflecting the buffering capacity to absorb changes in recharge rates r with respect to storage capacity s of the i th sdl both indicators can be combined to obtain a numerical ranking following the standardisation process described in appendix a barron et al 2011 we employed a revised method to rank groundwater management units based on an ordination approach barron et al 2011 as follows developed aquifer systems low responsiveness and high development scores responsive aquifer systems low development and high responsiveness scores and relevant aquifer systems high development and high responsiveness scores 2 2 3 1 occurrence and diversity of groundwater dependent ecosystems f gde in this work we improved on the calculation of f gde i in eq 3 currie et al 2010 barron et al 2011 by using the latest spatial data available from the gde atlas v 2019 published by the australian bureau of meteorology bom http www bom gov au water groundwater gde the gde atlas contains spatial information on aspects such as gde potential unknown low moderate high potential of interacting with groundwater gde ecotypes eco hydrogeological zones and specific areal extents this information was used to refine the f gde i factor to obtain a more robust and representative index eq 3 to achieve this we grouped aquatic gdes based on ecotype wetland river spring and eco hydrogeological zones resulting in 26 classes for aquatic gdes terrestrial gdes one vegetation ecotype class were grouped according to sub ecotype resulting in 476 classes we then adapted two widely used diversity indices namely shannon and simpson diversity indices gorelick 2006 spellerberg and fedor 2003 to use class areas instead of species counts within each groundwater sdl these diversity indices were calculated on filtered gde data to exclude areas defined as low or unknown gde potential for connection to groundwater they were weighted by the ratio between the gde area and the total sdl area areagde areasdl to account for the spatial relevance of gdes 2 2 3 2 recharge buffering capacity f r s the aquifer responsiveness indicator eq 4 combines the resource size the current level of groundwater use and the aquifer s capacity to buffer potential changes in recharge rates the factor f r s i barron et al 2011 is expressed as a membership function as follows 5 f r s 0 9 0 3 0 01 high r s moderate r s low r s to define the three classes high moderate and low r s ratios we used recharge estimates reported in the literature and average values of standing water levels the base level of the aquifer planar areas aquifer types and estimates of porosity for storage calculations dnrme 2018 mcneil et al 2018 mdba 2020a nsw dpi 2019b nsw dpi 2018c nsw dpi 2018b nsw dpi 2018a nsw dpi 2019a nsw dpie 2019a ogia 2016 water 2015 welsh et al 2014 welsh et al 2014 when alluvial depth was unavailable we used the depth of the regolith digital product wilford et al 2018 3 results 3 1 groundwater level trends in alluvial aquifers of the mdb up to 95 of the 910 observation bores used in the analysis showed deepening trends with 87 being statistically significant at an α 0 05 level there is therefore an overall deepening trend of dtw for the mdb alluvial aquifers during the last 50 years 1971 2021 regardless of annual statistic mean minimum and maximum dtw and the trend detection method used non parametric kendall test linear regression and two period comparison fu et al 2022 fig 3 shows sdl averaged trends for two groundwater sdls showing some of the most substantial decreasing trends across the alluvial aquifers this figure shows marked decreasing trends underlying cycles of recharge discharge at the sdl scale and substantial variation across observations grey dots used to estimate these trends sdl scale trends and the impact of large scale climate events such as the millennium drought are more pronounced in specific groundwater sdls see figure s 1 in the supplementary material table 2 shows the trend magnitudes sen s slope from the non parametric kendall s test hirsch et al 1982 for the average annual dtw other methods linear slope and ita and statistics minimum and maximum dtw showed similar results only 14 groundwater sdls fulfilled the criteria for data selection results showed that mean trend magnitudes vary between 0 03 m y and 0 19 m y with an average trend across sdls equal to 0 11 m y sdls showing above average deepening trends for mean annual dtw were identified as lower namoi alluvium gs29 lower murrumbidgee deep alluvium gs28b upper namoi alluvium gs47 goulburn murray sedimentary plain gs8c upper condamine alluvium cca gs64a lower gwydir alluvium gs24 and mid murrumbidgee alluvium gs31 except for gs28b 81 and gs24 73 groundwater sdls mentioned above show statistically significant decreasing trends in more than 90 of the observation bores in addition the long term mean trend for each sdl was used to estimate the groundwater depletion rate defined as the ratio between storage and net changes in storage richey et al 2015a these values are a worst case scenario as they represent the mean trend applied over the whole sdl area and are therefore only referential for the same sdls mentioned above except for gs8c 282 years we observe depletion rates below 125 years with lower values for upper and lower namoi alluvium gs29 ad gs47 interestingly gs44 and gs64b also show more than 90 of observation wells with statistically significant decreasing trends less than 100 years for the depletion rate and above average maximum trends they show below average mean trends indicating most likely the occurrence of hot spots with localised and intensive groundwater exploitation based on richey et al 2015a and de la hera portillo et al 2021 it is argued that groundwater sdls showing above average mean decreasing trends 90 of observation wells with statistically significant decreasing trends and low values of depletion rate are less resilient to long term changes and in reaching a new dynamic equilibrium state 3 2 groundwater footprint stress in alluvial aquifers of the mdb conceptually the gf represents the ratio between groundwater outputs inputs for a given area a table 3 shows the results for the gf and stress calculations when considering average metered groundwater usage for the period 2012 2019 we identified three groundwater sdls under stress gf a 1 lower namoi gs29 upper macquarie alluvium gs45 and upper namoi alluvium gs47 the main factors driving stress levels are groundwater usage in the namoi alluvium gs29 and gs47 rassam et al 2013 and groundwater contribution to environmental streamflow in the upper macquarie alluvium gs45 mdba 2020a the lower lachlan alluvium gs25 and lower gwydir alluvium gs24 show gf a ratios closer to 1 thus indicating that groundwater outputs are similar to the main inputs to the system to account for groundwater quality we used the igf section 2 2 2 and recalculated stress levels for different salinity classes fig 4 shows the spatial interpolation of the 95th percentile salinity values across all groundwater management units sdls and the corresponding salinity class areas used to calculate igf on average 72 of the groundwater sdl areas covering the alluvial aquifers are classified as freshwater 54 or brackish 18 groundwater whereas 25 is classified as saline highly saline areas are identified around the lower sections of the murray river in the gs8c gs27b and a localised area of the shepparton irrigation region gs8a fig 4 also shows that most of the freshwater areas 80 of the total sdl area concentrate around the narrow alluvial deposits located towards the uplands of the mdb and in the lower gwydir alluvium gs24 for the condamine alluvium gs64a fresh groundwater aligns well with the condamine river similarly alluvial aquifers in the mdb s extensive alluvial plains show freshwater pockets closely aligned with these regions main rivers e g lachlan gs25 murrumbidgee gs31 and gs28b and murray gs27b rivers this would suggest strong connections between surface water and groundwater for these alluvial aquifers extensive brackish and saline groundwater areas concentrate towards the lower sections of the sdl areas e g gs29 gs28b gs27b gs8c when including different salinity class areas in the calculation of the gf we observe substantial increases in stress levels igf in table 3 for example for groundwater sdls initially identified gs29 gs45 and gs47 stress levels increase between 60 and 160 whereas for lower lachlan gs25 a 3 4 fold increase in stress levels is observed similarly when using freshwater areas only in the calculation of groundwater stress i e discounting highly saline saline and brackish groundwater areas in the alluvial aquifers other groundwater sdls are identified under stress namely lower macquarie gs26 lower murrumbidgee deep gs28b upper condamine alluvium gs64a and gs64b and goulburn murray sedimentary plain gs8c the latter showing the largest 3 4 fold increase in the stress metric fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of the groundwater stress metric gf a at the sdl scale fig 5a shows the stress metric with no account for salinity data baseline for comparison this figure assumes all areas extent contributes to the calculation of the stress metric fig 5b accounts for areas defined as highly saline to calculate igf gs8a gs8c and gs27b these areas however are not extensive enough to move the groundwater stress metric igf a to values larger than one and no changes with respect to the baseline panel a are observed fig 5c accounts for highly saline and saline groundwater areas to calculate igf both lower lachlan alluvium gs25 and lower murrumbidgee deep alluvium gs28b move into stress conditions igf a 1 given the increase in areas falling under this salinity class 57 and 48 of total sdl area respectively at the same time lower gwydir alluvium gs24 lower macquarie alluvium gs26 and goulburn murray sedimentary plan gs8c show values greater than 0 8 for igf a finally fig 5d accounts for highly saline saline and brackish groundwater areas for this case a few sdls showing groundwater stress are added to the previous group lower macquarie alluvium gs26 upper condamine alluvium cca gs64a upper condamine alluvium tributaries gs64b and goulburn murray sedimentary plan gs8c it is interesting to note the case of the goulburn murray shepparton irrigation region gs8a which is below stress levels after accounting for highly saline saline and brackish groundwater areas given the low groundwater use and the substantial recharge and area considered in the calculation of the gf 3 3 3 3 development and responsiveness scores in the alluvial aquifers of the mdb fig 6 shows the total gde area and moderate to high gde potential areas for each groundwater sdl obtained from the gde atlas and used for calculating the f gde factor in eq 3 some sdls e g gs25 gs28a have substantial areas classified as gdes but these areas show limited areal extent for moderate to high gde potential for the alluvial aquifers moderate to high gde potential areas fluctuate between 3 and 29 of the total groundwater sdl areas analysed interestingly in some cases most of the gde area shows a documented moderate to high potential of interacting with groundwater e g gs43 gs64a gs64b gs8a gs8b thus the f gde calculation is anticipated to be robust across the proposed area weighting schemes fig 7 shows the calculation of f gde based on the normalised simpson dn and shannon hn diversity indices using gde areas presented in fig 6 this figure shows that trends for both diversity indices are similar when using all gdes e g dn vs hn or when diversity indices are weighted by the areal ratio areagde areasdl dan vs han interestingly there is more variability in f gde when an area weighted factor is implemented although not shown here there is also substantial variation in the diversity indices when only gde areas of moderate to high potential are considered fig 7 also shows that for certain groundwater sdls e g gs26 gs64a gs64b gs8a and gs8c the gde richness captured in the f gde metric e g dn is diluted when the diversity metric is weighted by the area e g dan this suggests that the relevance of gde areas with regard to the total groundwater sdl area might impact the calculation of the aquifer development score eq 3 this sensitivity must be accounted for when combining development and responsiveness scores fig 8 shows the f r s factor calculated for all groundwater sdls resource units in this figure a high recharge to storage ratio suggests higher sensitivity as there will be minimal buffering capacity in the aquifer to absorb changes in recharge in contrast lower sensitivity will be observed in the opposite situation currie et al 2010 higher values for the f r s factor are therefore observed for small groundwater sdls such as the upper macquarie alluvium gs45 upper gwydir alluvium gs43 and namoi tributary alluvium gs48 see table 1 in contrast lower values are associated with larger alluvial systems such as lower murray deep alluvium gs27b and lower lachlan alluvium gs25 to assess the sensitivity in estimating f gde fig 9 shows the development responsiveness and numerical relevance scores using different weighting schemes for the simpson s diversity index sdi similar results are obtained using shannon s diversity index and therefore they are omitted here it is worth noting that the responsiveness score remains unchanged as changes in f gde only impact the development and numerical relevance scores when weighing the simpson diversity indices by the gde area d vs da or by the moderate to high potential gde area i e da vs daf to calculate f gde discrepancies arise in the development score e g gs8c gs64a gs64b gs24 this is expected as these groundwater sdls have less than 8 of the total area defined as gdes similarly when the diversity index is weighted by the gde areas of moderate to high potential gs25 gs8c gs8a and gs26 show the largest fluctuations in the development score sensitivities in the numerical relevance score size of the symbol in fig 9 are less relevant thus indicating robust values across groundwater sdls when combining the development and responsiveness scores fig 9 also shows the ordination approach defined as coloured regions in the panels of the figure i e blue region high development and low responsiveness scores green region high responsiveness and low development scores and yellow region high development and high responsiveness scores following barron et al 2011 we defined the top 10 out of 22 groundwater sdls as cut off values to determine the coloured regions of the ordination approach upper macquarie gs45 shows a high responsiveness score given a high f r s factor 0 9 and b average annual groundwater use 16 643 ml y closely approaching the sustainable diversion limit value of 17 900 ml y goulburn murray sedimentary plain gs8c and the shepparton irrigation region gs8a show high development scores this changes when weighting the diversity index d by gde area da positioning lower lachlan gs25 at the top and upper namoi gs47 second this is explained by the large ratio of groundwater extraction of gs25 and gs47 with respect to the largest groundwater extraction across all groundwater sdls and the changes in f gde observed in gs8a and gs8c when weighting the diversity index by gde area see fig 7 notably groundwater sdls in the blue region dominate the numerical relevance score bubble size in contrast groundwater sdls showing high responsiveness scores green region have little impact on the numerical relevance score bubble size the development score thus drives the numerical relevance score however groundwater sdls with a high numerical relevance score small bubble size might not fall in the yellow area defined by the ordination approach following the ordination approach two groundwater sdls gs8a and gs31 were consistently identified as showing high development and responsiveness scores for the different weighting schemes shown in fig 9 for gs8a goulburn murray shepparton irrigation region this is mainly driven by the ratio between sdlgs8a 244 100 ml y and sdlmax gs28b 273 600 ml y to calculate the development score eq 3 this ratio reflects the size of the sustainably exploitable resource in gs8a with respect to the largest groundwater sdl in the dataset gs28b it is worth noting that the average groundwater use metered in gs8a for 2012 2019 represents only 23 of its sustainable diversion limit sdlgs8a 244 100 ml y for gs31 mid murrumbidgee this is mainly driven by the ratio between metered groundwater use for the period 2012 2019 38 957 ml y and the sdlgs31 53 500 ml y used to calculate the responsiveness score eq 4 combined with a moderate r s ratio as shown in fig 8 3 4 aspects of resilience stress and sustainability of alluvial aquifers of the mdb fig 10 summarises the standardised groundwater based indicators used as proxies for analysing groundwater resilience stress and sustainability aspects results show eleven groundwater sdls where resilience stress or sustainability issues have been identified lower gwydir alluvium gs24 lower lachlan alluvium gs25 lower murrumbidgee deep alluvium gs28b lower namoi alluvium gs29 mid murrumbidgee alluvium gs31 upper lachlan alluvium gs44 upper macquarie alluvium gs45 upper namoi alluvium gs47 upper condamine alluvium cca gs64a goulburn murray shepparton irrigation region gs8a and goulburn murray sedimentary plain gs8c out of these groundwater sdls evidence indicates that stress resilience and potential sustainability issues are simultaneously identified for the namoi alluvial aquifer comprising gs29 and gs47 in contrast the mid murrumbidgee alluvial aquifer gs31 shows resilience and sustainability issues for the case of the upper condamine alluvium gs64a lower murrumbidgee deep gs28b as well as the goulburn murray sedimentary plain gs8c evidence suggests groundwater management units experience resilience issues due to declining groundwater levels and high depletion rates potential stress issues when considering salinity levels in groundwater stress calculations and potential sustainability issues when presence and diversity of gdes are considered upper macquarie gs45 shows stress issues mainly driven by the reported contribution from groundwater to streamflow mdba 2020a in contrast upper lachlan gs44 shows resilience issues driven by the number of wells showing statistically significant declining trends and high depletion rates and potential sustainability issues driven by the aquifer development score a similar pattern is observed for gs8a but with strong evidence from the development score and ordination approach indicating sustainability issues lower gwydir gs24 and lower lachlan gs25 show above average values for all indicators across all sdls used as proxies to analyse resilience stress and sustainability except for lower lachlan gs25 stress issues when considering groundwater salinity all other indicators are similar for these two groundwater sdls thus indicating no clear evidence of specific resilience stress or sustainability issues similarly emerging stress and sustainability issues have been identified for lower macquarie alluvium gs26 when groundwater salinity and the occurrence and diversity of gdes are considered in contrast for the upper condamine alluvium tributaries gs64b potential resilience issues have been identified localised highest maximum trend values across sdls 4 discussion we proposed an indicator based framework anchored in groundwater resilience stress and sustainability to assess the main alluvial aquifers of the mdb systemically numerous groundwater related indicators to inform decision making for sustainable management have been proposed in the literature lavapuro et al 2008 pires et al 2017 unesco ihp 2011 vrba et al 2007 2006 research suggests that groundwater stress metrics are the most commonly used due to simplicity and low data requirements hora 2022 whereas no specific nor dominant groundwater resilience or sustainability indicators are identified van der gun 2021 see supplementary material the indicators used in this work are fit for purpose measurable observable cover groundwater quantity and quality occurrence and diversity of gdes and aquifer performance aspects they are therefore well aligned with principles on groundwater indicator selection suggested by lavapuro et al 2008 they are also assessed at relevant management units i e groundwater sdl and are therefore closely aligned with recent definitions for groundwater sustainability elshall et al 2020 gleeson et al 2020 similarly the three lines of evidence and proxies used for groundwater resilience stress and sustainability are well aligned with the seven criteria proposed by liverman et al 1988 to define sustainability indicators singh and bhakar 2021 it can be argued that the indicators employed in this work are not comprehensive of each individual concept resilience stress sustainability we accept the premise that different aspects of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability might be intermingled in the indicators used in this framework for example the development and responsiveness scores barron et al 2011 currie et al 2010 used as proxies for groundwater sustainability consider aspects related to the occurrence and diversity of gdes ratios between groundwater use and availability sensitivity to changes in recharge and groundwater storage reserves all elements that can well be related to the ideas of groundwater stress richey 2014 richey et al 2015b and or resilience de la hera portillo et al 2021 2020 we argue that the value of the framework implemented in this work rests upon simultaneously examining the three lines of evidence rather than exploring the concepts of groundwater resilience stress and sustainability in isolation as tabarmayeh et al 2022 suggested an isolated analysis might result in conflicting results and erroneous policy recommendations we agree with preda et al 2014 that indicator based approaches are tools for problem identification and not for problem solving and can be used to bridge academic work and political needs which might facilitate the interactions between science policy and practice milman and macdonald 2020 however they might also oversimplify complex groundwater systems thus amplifying the risk of groundwater mismanagement this again confirms the value of analysing resilience stress and sustainability aspects simultaneously we embraced de la hera portillo et al 2021 idea that for heavily exploited aquifers the resilience analysis makes sense within a framework identifying the groundwater system s trend towards a new dynamic equilibrium if any groundwater resilience is not a single number but an emergent and contextual property of the groundwater system analysed de la hera portillo et al 2021 patterns observed from long term trend analysis suggest that for a majority ca 85 of the observation bores in the alluvial aquifers of the mdb analysed by fu et al 2022a a persistent declining trend in groundwater levels is observed for the period 1971 2021 results also show large proportions of observation bores showing statistically significant deepening trends and relatively high aquifer depletion rates particularly in those groundwater sdls experiencing continued exploitation the latter provides the foundation to identify resilience issues in those groundwater sdls with above average declining trends in groundwater levels across the mdb these metrics allow for an impartial comparison across groundwater sdls and can be further used to assess reliability resilience and vulnerability rrv sandoval solis et al 2011 once management interventions are implemented we acknowledge that the scale of the analysis groundwater sdl might not be representative of local circumstances reflecting the presence of confining conditions water table vs piezometric heads or flood recharge which might result in stable or even localised rising groundwater levels clark 2022 giambastiani and kelly 2010 kelly et al 2014 as mentioned in section 1 our objective is to provide a regional scale assessment across all main alluvial aquifers of the mdb thus evaluating local conditions or hotspots within groundwater sdls or differences between changes in pressure head and water table conditions is beyond the scope of this work groundwater stress estimated through the gf is driven by the ratio between groundwater outputs and inputs including the contributions from groundwater to environmental streamflow gleeson et al 2012 in this regard some authors acknowledge that groundwater stress analyses should be linked to fluctuations in groundwater storage assessments richey et al 2015a b taylor 2009 although the gf does not explicitly account for this in the stress calculation our proposed framework explicitly considers changes in storage in time and spatially through the groundwater trend analysis and the calculation of the responsiveness score i e f r s the namoi alluvium gs29 and gs47 shows the highest stress levels which reflects the comparatively high groundwater consumption for irrigation purposes rassam et al 2013 whereas high values of groundwater contribution to streamflows reported by mdba 2020a for the upper macquarie alluvium gs47 drive the gf in that sdl this highlights an important advantage of using the gf to assess groundwater stress identifying the factors driving groundwater stress chen et al 2020 according to chen et al 2020 the stress levels observed in these groundwater sdls suggest mild over exploitation the incorporation of groundwater salinity increased the stress index igf a for sdl areas with large proportions of saline and brackish water e g goulburn murray sp and sir and had little effect on areas dominated by fresh groundwater table 3 and fig 5 groundwater salinity and soil salinisation in the mdb especially in the mid and lower parts of the basin are well documented issues hart et al 2020b mdba 2015 much of the basin particularly the southern basin has naturally saline groundwater due to millennia of deposition weathering and a marine geological history walker and prosser 2021 however two centuries of deep rooted vegetation clearance for cropping and grazing and expansion of irrigated land have led to groundwater mounding landscape salinisation and discharge of saline groundwater to streams and rivers that have been associated with losses of native vegetation and agricultural production hart et al 2020b these issues have necessitated active management programs such as salt interception schemes over the past few decades to lower the water table to prevent further damage restore landscapes and riverine ecosystems and reduce salt input to rivers mdba 2015 there are 14 salt interception schemes operating mainly adjacent to the murray river that are essential to achieving salinity reduction targets mdba 2015 two are in the proximity of the goulburn murray gs8c highly saline area identified in fig 4 and the rest are downstream of the main alluvial sdl areas in this study in the shepparton irrigation region gs8a active management of water table heights through additional pumping is applied to reduce risks of soil salinisation induced through irrigation mdba 2020a by incorporating salinity in the groundwater stress index the current study has highlighted that along with extraction groundwater quality risks also threaten the long term sustainability of groundwater resources for environmental and consumptive purposes in critical parts of the mdb there is a rich literature on methods to assess groundwater sustainability and as a result some degree of ambiguity regarding assessment metrics chen et al 2015 van der gun 2021 we embraced the ideas by elshall et al 2020 and gleeson et al 2020 that sustainability should be assessed with respect to aquifer performance and management governance aspects first data on recharge storage groundwater use groundwater sustainable diversion limits presence and diversity of gdes and buffering capacity of groundwater sdl resource units were considered these aspects align well with system properties and current stresses driving sustainability van der gun 2021 and the objectives of sustainability assessments lambán et al 2011 despite some ambiguity in the development score due to alternative methods for calculating the f gde factor the ordination approach to identify groundwater sdls was robust one advantage of the metrics employed as a proxy for sustainability development and responsiveness is identifying the main factors driving the corresponding scores this further supports the advantage of assessing multiple lines of evidence in the proposed framework majidipour et al 2021 at the same time data requirements are relatively modest compared to other proposed frameworks used to assess groundwater sustainability chen et al 2015 hosseini et al 2019 majidipour et al 2021 pandey et al 2011 samani 2021 some degree of uncertainty might be expected in our results and analysis we tried minimising this by accessing quality controlled and officially reported datasets although this does not guarantee error free datasets 5 conclusions long term trend analysis indicates that nine groundwater sdls show above average declining trends in groundwater levels a high number of observation bores showing statistically significant declining trends and high depletion rates thus pointing towards groundwater resilience issues to achieve a new equilibrium stage groundwater footprint assessment indicates that three groundwater sdls are under stress mainly driven by groundwater extraction and contributions to environmental streamflow including data on groundwater salinity in the assessment adds substantial pressure to the groundwater sdls groundwater sustainability assessment shows that two groundwater sdls can be regarded as relevant following the ordination approach based on the development and responsiveness scores despite some sensitivity observed by using different gde diversity metrics the ordination approach was robust overall eleven out of 22 groundwater sdls were identified as having resilience stress or sustainability issues across the main alluvial aquifers of the mdb the namoi alluvium gs29 and gs47 shows simultaneous signs of resilience stress and potential sustainability issues whereas mid murrumbidgee gs31 shows resilience and sustainability issues the upper condamine alluvium gs64a lower murrumbidgee deep gs28b and goulburn murray sedimentary plains gs8c show signs of resilience issues potential stress issues when considering groundwater salinity and potential sustainability issues due to the presence and diversity of gdes upper macquarie gs45 shows stress driven by groundwater contributions to streamflow in contrast upper lachlan gs44 shows resilience issues driven by declining trends and high depletion rates and potential sustainability issues driven by the aquifer development score a similar pattern is observed for gs8a with stronger evidence indicating sustainability issues despite having above average values across all indicators lower gwydir gs24 and lower lachlan gs25 show no clear evidence of specific resilience stress or sustainability issues the exception is for lower lachlan gs25 when considering groundwater salinity two other specific groundwater management units show signs of emergent resilience gs64b or sustainability issues gs26 due to localised maximum declining trends and the presence and diversity of gdes in this work we showed the value of simultaneously examining aspects related to groundwater resilience stress and sustainability rather than analysing each aspect in isolation which ultimately might result in biased and or conflicting results this framework can help guide efforts to improve groundwater management in those areas identified by addressing specific resilience stress and sustainability issues and providing guidance to focus efforts on priority regions for future development

7687,study region the dongting lake basin is a typical regional study in humid southern china with data scarce areas study focus this study improved the streamflow simulation by coupling hydrological and hydrodynamic models and considering water yields in data scarce areas we constructed a soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model of the dongting lake basin to simulate the streamflow in the data scarce areas which was further coupled into the mike21 hydrodynamic model as additional boundary conditions new hydrological insights the results showed that the relative error of streamflow simulation was reduced from 24 64 to 10 50 in the coupled hydrological hydraulic model over the singular hydrodynamic model which also indirectly verified the results of streamflow simulation in the data scarce area based on the coupled model the annual water yields in the data scarce areas were estimated to be 38 95 109 m3 representing 15 13 of the yearly water yields in the basin the water yields in the data scarce areas showed a seasonal variation which was concentrated from april to july the monthly water balance error of the dongting lake basin was significantly reduced 57 42 when considering the water yields in data scarce areas the model coupling approach in this study can be applied to other data scarce areas to improve streamflow simulation graphical abstract ga1 keywords dongting lake basin data scarce area coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models streamflow simulation lake water balance data availability no data was used for the research

al 2018 nakayama and shankman 2013 parparov and gal 2012 lake hydrology has been changing dramatically however as a result of climate variability and human intervention tao et al 2020 woolway et al 2020 one of the major problems faced today is the gradual shrinking of lakes busker et al 2019 yu et al 2020 which has led to a reduction in water storage capacity and has reduced water for drinking industry and irrigation thus hindering socioeconomic development with the increasing demand for water resources haddeland et al 2014 veldkamp et al 2017 it is extremely important to study the changing patterns of the hydrological conditions of lakes and to explore the implications of natural factors and anthropogenic activities on lake hydraulics for the rational development utilization and protection of lake water resources changes in lake hydrological conditions have received significant global attention haghighi and klove 2015 lai et al 2016 using hydrodynamic models to explore the dynamic course of water flow and the propagation patterns of substances in water has become a common method to study these conditions yao et al 2019 qi et al 2017 studied the impact of basin runoff variations on the hydrodynamic characteristics of poyang lake under future climate conditions by a hydrodynamic model lai et al 2014 used a hydrodynamic model to study the influences of inlet streamflow and yangtze river streamflow on the hydraulic properties of poyang lake these researchers simulated the hydrodynamic characteristics of lakes using hydrodynamic models but ignored the streamflow in the data scarce area generally hydrodynamic models require boundary input conditions from gauging stations but lake catchment areas have a large number of data scarce areas and the streamflow in these areas is often neglected zhang et al 2020 resulting in larger uncertainty in the simulation results of lake streamflow to advance streamflow research in data scarce areas new techniques theories and methods have been applied and a series of research results have been achieved jiang et al 2021 hrachowitz et al 2013 kong et al 2019 a widely used approach is regionalization arsenault et al 2019 which is a process of transferring hydrological information from the measurement area to the data scarce areas bao et al 2012 yang et al 2020 jillo et al 2017 applied a rainfall runoff model to the runoff observation area and roughly estimated the water yields in the remaining data scarce area by the regionalization method but the results were not validated jodar et al 2018 simulated the streamflow in a data scarce area by transplanting calibrated hydrological model parameters from neighboring regions but the results of validation based on annual mean streamflow were not satisfactory because the annual time scale data were not accurate enough therefore further accuracy verification was required zhang et al 2017 estimated the water yield in the data scarce area using the regionalization method and validated it with a hydrodynamic model but the parameters of the data scarce area in the downstream of the basin were derived from the upstream calibration parameters as indicated by zhang et al 2017 the plain dominated topography of the data scarce area downstream of the basin differs greatly from the predominantly montane and hill topography upstream of the basin as a result the direct transfer of the upstream calibration parameters of the basin does not apply well to the data scarce area downstream therefore it is difficult to accurately simulate streamflow in data scarce areas and validate the results effectively the coupled hydrological hydraulic model can be used as a validation method for simulating streamflow in the data scarce area lu et al 2018 hydrological and hydrodynamic models have been frequently used to study the complex response relationships between rivers and lakes li et al 2019 applied the coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models to mountainous areas and completed a simulation of mountainous floods and the mapping of flash flood risks li et al 2014 applied the coupled hydrological watlac and hydrodynamic mike21 models to poyang lake and simulated the seasonal changes of streamflow field and water surface area in the lake munar et al 2018 applied the coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models to a large lake with the existence of several catchments to enhance the simulation of the dynamic variation in the hydrodynamic features of the lake and to provide a better insight into the relationship between the response of rivers and lake molina navarro et al 2018 developed a tool called swat2lake to reduce the uncertainty in the coupling of hydrological and hydrodynamic models due to the large differences between the delineated and actual sub basins a similar module was available in the swat model bieger et al 2017 however the lack of direct observations from gauging stations in data scarce areas makes it difficult to further validate the estimated water yields this makes it difficult to meet the needs of modern increasingly accurate hydrological simulations moreover in previous hydrodynamic models data scarce areas were often not considered or simply estimated without further validation this created more uncertainty in the results dongting lake located at the yangtze river in china is a large lake with an abundance of natural water resources and a large extent of data scarce areas exist in the lake basin area representing about 20 of the overall area of the basin after the three gorges reservoir came into service in 2003 the hydrologic conditions in dongting lake changed dramatically with a series of problems such as the shrinking of the lake intensification of drought and an early dry period hu et al 2015 wang et al 2014 xu et al 2018 after 2009 the three gorges reservoir started to operate according to the 145 175 m scheme which led to further changing hydrologic conditions in dongting lake han et al 2016 from the beginning to the middle of october 2009 the average water level at chenglingji a hydrological station at the outlet of dongting lake was 22 62 m which was 4 32 m lower than the multiyear mean water level for this period and entered the dry period one and a half months earlier than normal to better exploit and protect dongting lake many scholars have applied hydrodynamic models to study dongting lake lai et al 2013 studied the influence of the three gorges dam on the wetland conditions of dongting lake through a hydrodynamic model liu et al 2020a used mike21 to investigate the feasibility of innovative flood control schemes in dongting lake these studies however have ignored the water yields in the data scarce areas and have focused more on the simulation results of water level and less on the simulation results of streamflow although accurate water level simulations often can be obtained by calibrating model parameters the simulation of streamflow is often unsatisfactory because of the neglect of water yields in data scarce areas dai et al 2017 considered the water yield in the data scarce area in the hydrodynamic model and simulated the effects of the three gorges dam on the water exchange between dongting lake and yangtze river but the water yield in the data scarce area estimated by a simple rainfall runoff conversion relationship was crude and lacked an effective validation in summary most of previous studies on dongting lake did not consider the water yields in the data scarce areas or roughly considered it without an effective verification and instead focused more on the simulation results of water level and less on the simulation results of streamflow considering this research gap we constructed coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models of the dongting lake basin to improve streamflow simulation considering the water yields of data scarce areas in the dongting lake basin the main aims of the research were as follows 1 accurately simulate and verify the streamflow in the data scarce area 2 improve the simulation accuracy of the streamflow in the hydrodynamic model 3 estimate the water yields in the data scarce areas and analyze its evolution and 4 analyze the impact of the data scarce area on the water balance of dongting lake 2 study area dongting lake is a large lake located on the yangtze river in china it plays a crucial function in water provision flood prevention and mitigation as well as ecological diversity protection dongting lake is composed of three parts west dongting lake south dongting lake and east dongting lake the main source of streamflow in dongting lake includes four rivers xiangjiang zijiang yuanjiang and lishui in the south and inflow of the yangtze river through the songzi hudu and ouchi rivers in the north and it eventually joins the yangtze river again from chenglingji the dongting lake basin consists of the xiangjiang basin the zijang basin the yuanjiang basin the lishui basin and the data scarce area downstream of the watershed fig 1 the streamflow of the xiangjiang zijang yuanjiang and lishui basins inflow from the yangtze river and the outflow of the entire dongting lake can be monitored by hydrological gauging stations the streamflow in the data scarce areas downstream of the dongting lake basin however is not monitored and often is neglected which has led to increased uncertainty in the water balance studies the area of the dongting lake basin is about 260 000 km2 and the area of the xiangjiang zijang yuanjiang and lishui basins accounts for about 80 of the total basin area the topography of the dongting lake basin is mainly mountainous and hilly the data scarce area downstream of the dongting lake basin accounts for about 20 of the basin area with some hilly areas at the edge and the rest being alluvial plains with the elevation ranging from 23 to 45 m the plain area has a complex water system and a large amount of water exchange the dongting lake basin has a typical tropical sub monsoon atmosphere with ample heat and precipitation the mean yearly precipitation is 1427 mm yr and the mean yearly temperature is 17 c 3 data and methods this research had three components hydrological modeling hydrodynamic modeling and coupling of hydrology and hydrodynamic models first we constructed a soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model of the dongting lake basin and estimated the water yield in the data scarce area of dongting lake to analyze its evolution considering the large differences in physical properties such as topography and climate among different sub basins we divided the whole dongting lake basin into the xiangjiang zijang yuanjiang and lishui basins and the data scarce area for calibration second we constructed the mike21 model of dongting lake and simulated the hydrodynamics in the initial scenario without considering the production and sink streamflow in the data scarce area third the hydrological and hydrodynamic models were coupled and set to an adjustment scenario which was compared with the initial scenario results to assess the accuracy of the coupled models meanwhile the precision of the water yields estimated in the data scarce areas was also indirectly verified furthermore we explored the effects of the data scarce area on the water balance of dongting lake the basic data required for swat consisted of the digital elevation model dem land use data soil data meteorological data and hydrological information this research used the dem data from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm with 90 m resolution which can be downloaded from the geospatial data cloud the land use data were obtained by unsupervised classification based on the 2015 landsat 8 remote sensing images obtained from the geospatial data cloud the land use types were classified into arable land forest land grassland water bodies building land and unused land soil data were collected from the world harmony soil database and the soil classification system is fao 90 the meteorological information was obtained from 121 weather stations the daily average streamflow data of nine hydrological gauging stations i e xiangtan taojiang taoyuan jinshi xinjiangkou shadaoguan mituosi kangjiagang and guanjiapu from 2009 to 2020 were obtained from the hunan hydrological and water resources survey center the data required for mike21 included topographic elevation data and hydrological data the topographic data were the actual elevation point data in 2011 at a scale of 1 5000 obtained from the hunan provincial hydrological and water resources survey center the hydrological data included daily average water level data and streamflow data at nine hydrological gauging stations i e xiangtan taojiang taoyuan jinshi zhicheng luoshan chenglingji lujiao and yingtian from 2009 to 2020 3 1 hydrological model we used the swat hydrological model to estimate the streamflow in the data scarce areas the swat hydrological model is the geographic information system gis based distributed watershed hydrological tool designed by the united states department of agriculture in 1994 this model describes the physical processes of the water cycle accurately and can be adapted to study the impacts of climate variations and human actions on water deposition and chemistry in complicated and changing situations plunge et al 2022 liu et al 2020b the swat hydrological model extracts the water system from the dem data and then divides it into several sub basins each of which is individually divided into several hydrological response units each hydrologic response unit consists of an assembly of soil land use and slope and this unit is the smallest unit of study the swat hydrological model is widely used in watershed streamflow simulation because of its strong physical mechanism which reduces the dependence on data and achieves better simulation results even in data scarce areas kanishka and eldho 2020 cibin et al 2014 we simulated the water yields in the four sub basins and the data scarce areas of the dongting lake watershed using the swat model and considered the inflow from the yangtze river in the hydrological model by adding point sources the climatic conditions and physical characteristics of the four sub basins and the data scarce areas of the dongting lake basin vary greatly chen et al 2022 zhou et al 2019 geng et al 2021 lotz et al 2018 it is difficult to apply only one set of parameters to the whole dongting lake basin hence we calibrated the hydrological model of the whole dongting lake basin according to different sub basins first calibration was performed for the xiangjiang zijang yuanjiang and lishui basins upstream of the dongting lake basin using daily average streamflow data from xiangtan taojiang taoyuan and jinshi hydrological stations respectively we performed subsequent calibration of the data scarce areas downstream of the dongting lake basin using the daily average discharge data from the chenglingji hydrological station the simulation period was 2009 2020 with 2009 2014 as the calibration period and 2015 2020 as the validation period in this study we used the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient the coefficient of determination r2 and the relative percentage error pbias to evaluate the simulation accuracy of the hydrological model sharafati and pezeshki 2020 mengistu et al 2021 loi et al 2019 we used the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi2 function of swat cup poojashree et al 2023 to perform the sensitivity analysis of the parameters and used it to select the 10 major sensitivity parameters the selected sensitive parameters were calibrated using the sufi2 method as well as the manual rate determination method the sensitivity parameters and the optimal parameter values for sub basins are shown in table 1 3 2 hydrodynamic model we used the mike21 model to conduct simulations of the hydrodynamic characteristics of dongting lake the mike21 hydrodynamic model was developed by the danish institute of hydrology it is one of a series of hydrodynamic software programs that uses a planar two dimensional mathematical model of streamflow to simulate the streamflow field characteristics of largescale water masses such as rivers lakes estuaries coasts and bays it has been used extensively in hydrodynamic water quality and sediment studies of surface waters because of its high compatibility nigussie and altunkaynak 2019 zhang et al 2022 mike21 is based on unstructured triangular meshes which can fit complex shorelines and terrain well and it also can facilitate local grid encryption for certain key areas in addition the model has the method of discriminating dry and wet water depth by setting the minimum wet and dry water depth the model can determine whether the grid is involved in the calculation and it can accurately simulate the frequent exposure and inundation process of the continental wetland this model can adapt to shallow and wide terrain and complex shorelines because of its fully physical mechanism and flexible triangular mesh profile li et al 2017 2020 in this research we used the nonstructural grid for meshing to ensure the accuracy of the calculation and to reduce the time required for the calculation the computational grid was appropriately encrypted in key research areas and areas with large topographic variations smaller grids were used in the river with a grid size of 50 300 m a larger grid was used in the dongting lake area with a grid size of 300 700 m and a total number of 238 956 grids the scope of the study area and the grid division of the hydrodynamic model are shown in fig 2 the parameter calibration of the hydrodynamic model was carried out in the initial scenario the initial scenario did not consider the water yields in the data scarce areas which is a common way to model the hydrodynamics of dongting lake the upstream flow boundary of the initial scenario was the daily average streamflow data for zhicheng xiangtan taojiang taoyuan and jinshi stations and the downstream boundary was the actual measured water level for luoshan station the parameter manning s coefficient zaifoglu et al 2019 was applied to reflect the roughness characteristics with the parameter range of 32 65 which was well calibrated by liu et al 2020 to obtain an accurate model for the hydrodynamic characteristics of dongting lake to maintain the stability of the model and to improve the computational speed the minimum time step was set to 0 01 s the drying depth was 0 005 m the flooding depth was 0 05 m and the wetting depth was 0 1 m we used daily average water level data from 2009 to 2020 at chenglingji lujiao and yingtian stations for model calibration with 2009 2014 as the calibration period and 2015 2020 as the validation period four metrics that is nse r2 pbias and root mean square error rmse were selected to evaluate the model accuracy doan et al 2019 shen et al 2020 wang et al 2021 to analyze the effect of water yields in the data scarce areas on the hydrodynamic characteristics of dongting lake we set up two simulation scenarios the initial scenario and the adjustment scenario the adjustment scenario took the water yield in the data scarce area simulated by the hydrological model as an additional input condition and the rest of the boundary conditions were the same as they were in the initial scenario the main parameter settings of the adjustment scenario were the same as they were in the initial scenario the boundaries of the two simulation scenarios are shown in table 2 and fig 3 3 3 coupling of hydrological and hydrodynamic models we used the simulated streamflow of the hydrological model in the data scarce area as an additional input condition to couple the hydrological and hydrodynamic models the coupled hydrological hydraulic model included coupling in time and space to ensure the temporal coupling we simulated both hydrological and hydrodynamic models on a daily scale to ensure spatial coupling we generated sub basins and water systems that matched the actual river conditions 3 4 sub basin division and streamflow allocation because the data scarce areas are mostly plain areas and have complex water systems the water systems automatically generated by the swat hydrological model often differ greatly from the actual situation as a result it is difficult to assign the uninformed simulated streamflow to the corresponding hydrodynamic boundaries therefore we corrected the generated water system to reflect the true river sub basin yield streamflow correction of the water system was achieved by modifying the dem elevation we used landsat 8 remote sensing images in 2015 to extract the rivers in the data scarce area and modified the dem based on the extracted rivers to complete the correction of the water system this modification should reflect the real streamflow direction and connect the actual inlet of the rivers we divided the generated sub basins into corresponding sub basin groups according to the inlet of the actual river inflow the whole data scarce area was divided into 9 sub basin groups fig 4 which correspond to 9 additional boundary conditions in the hydrodynamic model to improve the computational efficiency and reduce the data transfer time we established a data interface between the models by matlab scripts the water yield of the sub basins corresponding to the data scarce areas in the swat model was automatically extracted and directly converted into the input file of the mike21 model to participate in the calculation of the mike21 model in the form of new boundary conditions 3 5 validation of simulated streamflow in data scarce areas to further validate the streamflow simulated results in the data scarce area we established two scenarios i e the adjusted scenario and the initial scenario and set the parameters of these two scenarios to be identical in contrast to the adjusted scenario the initial scenario did not consider the water yield in the data scarce area in the adjusted scenario the simulated water yield from the data scarce area was entered as a point source inflow at the inlet of the corresponding lake we verified the simulation results of water yield in the data scarce area by validating the simulation results of the two scenarios against the observed data if the simulation accuracy of the adjusted scenario was higher than in the initial scenario it indicated that the simulation of streamflow in the data scarce area was accurate 3 6 lake water balance analysis water balance analysis is the basis of water resources planning utilization and supply and demand forecasting the existence of a large number of data scarce areas however has led to large uncertainties in water balance analysis to evaluate the effects of the data scarce area on the water balance of dongting lake we constructed a water balance equation of the lake based on the principle that the variance among the inflow and outflow would equate to the change in lake storage as follows 1 q in s ε q out where q in is the inflow to each basin s is the change in lake storage q out is the observed outflow at chenglingji station and ε is the errors in the observed data and other components such as data scarce streamflow and model uncertainty because the hydrodynamic model can simulate the sum of q in and s it is set to simulate the streamflow at chenglingji the outlet of dongting lake the initial scenario ignores the river streamflow without information the water balance equation contains only the observed streamflow at the gauging station q simout ini q xiangtan q taojiang q taoyuan q jinshi 2 q inflow from the yangtze river s 3 q s imout ini ε ini q out the adjustment scenario takes into account the streamflow in the data scarce areas q

initial scenario hydrodynamic model in chenglingji ε ini is the error in the initial scenario equation q simout adj is the adjustment of the hydrodynamic model to simulate streamflow at chenglingji ε adj is the simulation error in the adjustment scenario q xiangtan q taojiang q taoyuan and q jinshi are the streamflow values observed at xiangtan taojiang taoyuan and jinshi gauging stations respectively q inflow from the yangtze river is the streamflow from the yangtze river and q data scarce area is the streamflow simulated by the hydrological model we analyzed the impact of water yields in the data scarce areas on the water balance of dongting lake by comparing the magnitude of ε ini and ε adj values if the data scarce streamflow simulated by the swat model had sufficient accuracy the error of the adjusted scenario ε adj was smaller than that of the initial scenario ε ini 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration and validation of swat and mike21 models to accurately simulate the streamflow in the dongting lake basin the swat hydrological model and mike21 hydrodynamic model were calibrated and validated table 3 and fig 5 show the calibration and validation results of the swat model the results of five stations achieved good results with r2 and nse greater than 0 69 and pbias within 10 this result indicated the high suitability of the swat hydrological model in dongting lake basin and also the good streamflow simulation performance table 4 and fig 6 show the calibration and validation results of the mike21 hydrodynamic model the water level simulation results of three stations yingtian lujiao and chenglingji indicated that the r2 and nse were greater than 0 98 rmse was less than 0 48 m and pbias was less than 1 32 the streamflow simulation results of chenglingji station indicated that r2 was greater than 0 95 nse was greater than 0 79 and pbias was less than 24 74 the large pbias in the streamflow simulation of chenglingji station was due to the ignorance of streamflow in the data scarce areas and it was difficult to keep a highly accurate simulation of streamflow while ensuring a fixed water level calibration therefore these results indicated the high applicability of the model in dongting lake which could well simulate the hydraulic dynamic features of the lake 4 2 validation of simulated streamflow in data scarce areas we further validated streamflow simulation results in the data scarce area by comparing the simulation accuracy of the initial scenario with the adjusted scenario table 5 and fig 6 show the simulation results of the initial and adjusted scenarios the water level simulation results of three stations yingtian lujiao and chenglingji showed that the simulation accuracy of the water level in the adjustment scenario improved slightly compared with the initial scenario the downstream boundary water level condition of the model played a controlling role and the simulation results of the water level were already sufficiently good enough therefore simply increasing the streamflow in the data scarce area did not play a significant role in the improvement for the initial scenario the streamflow simulation results of chenglingji indicated that the r2 was 0 98 nse was 0 79 and pbias was 24 64 for the adjusted scenario the streamflow simulation accuracy was significantly improved with the r2 increasing to 0 98 nse increasing to 0 94 and pbias decreasing to 10 50 these results indicated that the hydrodynamic streamflow simulation was more accurate after considering the streamflow in the data scarce area therefore the streamflow simulation in the data scarce area was reasonable 4 3 analysis of the evolution pattern of water yield in data scarce areas as shown in fig 7a the maximum and minimum monthly water yields in different years differed to some extent the maximum monthly water yield in a year was distributed from april to july and the minimum monthly water yield was distributed in january and february and from september to december in the data scarce area the maximum amount of water was 10 84 10 9 m 3 in july 2016 and the minimum amount of water was 0 30 10 9 m 3 in november 2009 extreme rainfall and drought events occurred in july 2016 and november 2009 respectively as indicated by the extreme meteorological data from the china meteorological network and these extreme rainfall and drought events largely affected the water yield in the data scarce areas as shown in fig 7b the average monthly water yields in the data scarce areas revealed clear seasonal variation patterns most of the water yields in the data scarce areas occurred from april to july and the maximum water yields occurred in july 6 74 10 9 m 3 the low water yields in the data scarce areas appeared from august to march with the minimum water yields occurring in january 1 21 10 9 m 3 as shown in fig 7c the water yields in data scarce areas showed obvious interannual variability with the maximum value 50 50 10 9 m 3 in 2020 and the minimum value 21 14 10 9 m 3 in 2011 the annual water yields in the data scarce areas followed an increasing trend with a rate of 0 89 109 m3 yr the average annual water yield in the data scarce area was 38 95 10 9 m3 representing 15 13 of the overall water yield of dongting lake the annual water yields in the data scarce areas were obtained through the water balance based on the actual measurement data of the measuring station which represented 15 33 of the overall water in dongting lake and was consistent with the simulation results 4 4 influence of water yields in data scarce areas on the water balance of dongting lake fig 8a compares the water balance error with and without considering the water yields in the data scarce areas the average monthly water balance error considering the water yields in data scarce areas was 2 21 10 9 m3 which was smaller by 57 42 than that without considering the water yields in data scarce areas these results indicated that considering the water yields in the data scarce areas significantly improved the water balance of the lake although the absolute value of ε adj was greater than that of ε ini in december 2009 and january 2010 this was reasonable because extreme drought events occurred in these two months as indicated by the china meteorological network these events resulted in a small impact on the water yields of the data scarce areas on the water balance of the lake basin instead the water yields in the data scarce areas appeared to be overestimated to some extent which eventually led to an increase in the water balance error hu et al 2018 in their dongting lake water level prediction model also found that not considering rainfall in data scarce areas would result in a severe underestimation of the dongting lake water level while considering rainfall in data scarce areas would balance between underestimation and overestimation of dongting lake water level therefore it was important to consider the water yields in data scarce areas to better understand the hydrodynamic characteristics of dongting lake figs 8b and 8c show the changes in mean monthly water balance error and the amount of change in the water balance error during the flood april september and dry january march october december periods as a percentage of the year the average monthly water balance error revealed seasonal variations the change in water balance error in dongting lake basin occurred mainly in the flood seasons 73 of the year which indicated the significant improvement of streamflow simulation in flood seasons when the adjusted scenario considered the water yields in the data scarce areas fig 9 shows the magnitude of the relative change in the monthly water balance error and the proportion of total water yield in dongting lake in the data scarce areas the magnitude of error change exhibited a gradual increase from january to april the maximum value of 91 39 followed by a decline from may to september the minimum value of 30 78 and a rise again from october to december this temporal pattern of the magnitude of error change was highly consistent with that of the proportion of total water yield in dongting lake in the data scarce areas the decrease of the relative change of water balance error was more obvious in the months when the proportion of the total water yield in dongting lake in the data scarce areas was higher 5 limitation and future work in this study a simple and commonly used method was used to couple the two models i e external coupling unidirectional coupling instead of the more advanced coupling method i e full coupling bi directional coupling such a simplified method has also been used by many recent studies yang et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 the external coupling method was easy to operate and had no restriction on the choice of models so it had strong applicability several research scholars have also conducted studies on the external coupling of the swat model with the mike21 model wang and li 2015 gu 2017 some studies do exist and solved the problem of automatic data transfer or water extraction i e full coupling or bi directional coupling between two different models peng et al 2022 wu et al 2017 however those studies were not focused on the two models used in this study i e swat and mike several research scholars have also carried out studies on the full coupling of the swat model with other models or the mike model with other models larsen et al 2014 semiromi and koch 2019 which indicate that the full coupling of swat hydrological model and mike hydrodynamic model was theoretically feasible however there is a scarcity of relevant studies to achieve the full coupling of swat and mike there are currently many obstacles and challenges to achieving full coupling of swat and mike with more advanced methods for instance the numerical solutions between swat and mike have significant differences making it difficult for data conversion and transfer also the basic language requirement for swat and mike programs was different swat is based on fortran while the scripting language in the mike operations platform is ironpython the different script languages create difficulties in coupling between models efficiently in future research we will select more suitable hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling software explore how to realize real time dynamic bidirectional data transfer between hydrological and hydrodynamic models and apply the coupled models to other areas of research further improvements on streamflow simulations may be achieved in future work by using machine learning methods such as neural networks to improve the estimation of parameter values also future work may use the models for flood research firstly flood forecasting can be realized by jointly using wrf meteorological model and the coupled models in this study secondly the simulation of streamflow can be performed at a longer time scale to explore the characteristics and patterns of historical flooding events under climate change future studies may also focus on the hydrological drought characterization and the propagation relationship and mechanisms between meteorological drought and hydrological drought using the improved long term streamflow data 6 conclusion in this study we accurately simulated and verified the streamflow in the data scarce areas of dongting lake basin by coupling the hydrological model swat and the hydrodynamic model mike21 meanwhile the simulation accuracy of the streamflow in the hydrodynamic model was improved when considering the water yields in the data scarce areas of the basin the coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models had higher simulation accuracy for both water level and streamflow compared with the single hydrodynamic model most notably the relative error of streamflow simulation reduced from 24 64 to 10 50 results indicated that the average annual water yields in the data scarce areas were 38 95 10 9 m3 representing 15 13 of the overall average yearly water in the basin the water yields in the data scarce areas showed seasonal variations and were concentrated from april to july by considering the water yields in the data scarce areas the average monthly water balance error was significantly reduced by 57 42 and a higher proportion of the overall water yields in the data scarce areas led to the more obvious reduction in the relative change in water balance error the coupled modeling method utilized in this study can be widely applied to lake basins where a large number of data scarce areas exist by considering the amount of water yields in data scarce areas it is possible to significantly reduce the errors in lake water balance and provide more accurate reference values and implications for the sustainable use of lake water and the planning of water conservation projects credit authorship

7687,study region the dongting lake basin is a typical regional study in humid southern china with data scarce areas study focus this study improved the streamflow simulation by coupling hydrological and hydrodynamic models and considering water yields in data scarce areas we constructed a soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model of the dongting lake basin to simulate the streamflow in the data scarce areas which was further coupled into the mike21 hydrodynamic model as additional boundary conditions new hydrological insights the results showed that the relative error of streamflow simulation was reduced from 24 64 to 10 50 in the coupled hydrological hydraulic model over the singular hydrodynamic model which also indirectly verified the results of streamflow simulation in the data scarce area based on the coupled model the annual water yields in the data scarce areas were estimated to be 38 95 109 m3 representing 15 13 of the yearly water yields in the basin the water yields in the data scarce areas showed a seasonal variation which was concentrated from april to july the monthly water balance error of the dongting lake basin was significantly reduced 57 42 when considering the water yields in data scarce areas the model coupling approach in this study can be applied to other data scarce areas to improve streamflow simulation graphical abstract ga1 keywords dongting lake basin data scarce area coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models streamflow simulation lake water balance data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as an important surface water resource lakes have a vital function in water provision flood prevention and mitigation and ecological security maintenance liu et al 2018 nakayama and shankman 2013 parparov and gal 2012 lake hydrology has been changing dramatically however as a result of climate variability and human intervention tao et al 2020 woolway et al 2020 one of the major problems faced today is the gradual shrinking of lakes busker et al 2019 yu et al 2020 which has led to a reduction in water storage capacity and has reduced water for drinking industry and irrigation thus hindering socioeconomic development with the increasing demand for water resources haddeland et al 2014 veldkamp et al 2017 it is extremely important to study the changing patterns of the hydrological conditions of lakes and to explore the implications of natural factors and anthropogenic activities on lake hydraulics for the rational development utilization and protection of lake water resources changes in lake hydrological conditions have received significant global attention haghighi and klove 2015 lai et al 2016 using hydrodynamic models to explore the dynamic course of water flow and the propagation patterns of substances in water has become a common method to study these conditions yao et al 2019 qi et al 2017 studied the impact of basin runoff variations on the hydrodynamic characteristics of poyang lake under future climate conditions by a hydrodynamic model lai et al 2014 used a hydrodynamic model to study the influences of inlet streamflow and yangtze river streamflow on the hydraulic properties of poyang lake these researchers simulated the hydrodynamic characteristics of lakes using hydrodynamic models but ignored the streamflow in the data scarce area generally hydrodynamic models require boundary input conditions from gauging stations but lake catchment areas have a large number of data scarce areas and the streamflow in these areas is often neglected zhang et al 2020 resulting in larger uncertainty in the simulation results of lake streamflow to advance streamflow research in data scarce areas new techniques theories and methods have been applied and a series of research results have been achieved jiang et al 2021 hrachowitz et al 2013 kong et al 2019 a widely used approach is regionalization arsenault et al 2019 which is a process of transferring hydrological information from the measurement area to the data scarce areas bao et al 2012 yang et al 2020 jillo et al 2017 applied a rainfall runoff model to the runoff observation area and roughly estimated the water yields in the remaining data scarce area by the regionalization method but the results were not validated jodar et al 2018 simulated the streamflow in a data scarce area by transplanting calibrated hydrological model parameters from neighboring regions but the results of validation based on annual mean streamflow were not satisfactory because the annual time scale data were not accurate enough therefore further accuracy verification was required zhang et al 2017 estimated the water yield in the data scarce area using the regionalization method and validated it with a hydrodynamic model but the parameters of the data scarce area in the downstream of the basin were derived from the upstream calibration parameters as indicated by zhang et al 2017 the plain dominated topography of the data scarce area downstream of the basin differs greatly from the predominantly montane and hill topography upstream of the basin as a result the direct transfer of the upstream calibration parameters of the basin does not apply well to the data scarce area downstream therefore it is difficult to accurately simulate streamflow in data scarce areas and validate the results effectively the coupled hydrological hydraulic model can be used as a validation method for simulating streamflow in the data scarce area lu et al 2018 hydrological and hydrodynamic models have been frequently used to study the complex response relationships between rivers and lakes li et al 2019 applied the coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models to mountainous areas and completed a simulation of mountainous floods and the mapping of flash flood risks li et al 2014 applied the coupled hydrological watlac and hydrodynamic mike21 models to poyang lake and simulated the seasonal changes of streamflow field and water surface area in the lake munar et al 2018 applied the coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models to a large lake with the existence of several catchments to enhance the simulation of the dynamic variation in the hydrodynamic features of the lake and to provide a better insight into the relationship between the response of rivers and lake molina navarro et al 2018 developed a tool called swat2lake to reduce the uncertainty in the coupling of hydrological and hydrodynamic models due to the large differences between the delineated and actual sub basins a similar module was available in the swat model bieger et al 2017 however the lack of direct observations from gauging stations in data scarce areas makes it difficult to further validate the estimated water yields this makes it difficult to meet the needs of modern increasingly accurate hydrological simulations moreover in previous hydrodynamic models data scarce areas were often not considered or simply estimated without further validation this created more uncertainty in the results dongting lake located at the yangtze river in china is a large lake with an abundance of natural water resources and a large extent of data scarce areas exist in the lake basin area representing about 20 of the overall area of the basin after the three gorges reservoir came into service in 2003 the hydrologic conditions in dongting lake changed dramatically with a series of problems such as the shrinking of the lake intensification of drought and an early dry period hu et al 2015 wang et al 2014 xu et al 2018 after 2009 the three gorges reservoir started to operate according to the 145 175 m scheme which led to further changing hydrologic conditions in dongting lake han et al 2016 from the beginning to the middle of october 2009 the average water level at chenglingji a hydrological station at the outlet of dongting lake was 22 62 m which was 4 32 m lower than the multiyear mean water level for this period and entered the dry period one and a half months earlier than normal to better exploit and protect dongting lake many scholars have applied hydrodynamic models to study dongting lake lai et al 2013 studied the influence of the three gorges dam on the wetland conditions of dongting lake through a hydrodynamic model liu et al 2020a used mike21 to investigate the feasibility of innovative flood control schemes in dongting lake these studies however have ignored the water yields in the data scarce areas and have focused more on the simulation results of water level and less on the simulation results of streamflow although accurate water level simulations often can be obtained by calibrating model parameters the simulation of streamflow is often unsatisfactory because of the neglect of water yields in data scarce areas dai et al 2017 considered the water yield in the data scarce area in the hydrodynamic model and simulated the effects of the three gorges dam on the water exchange between dongting lake and yangtze river but the water yield in the data scarce area estimated by a simple rainfall runoff conversion relationship was crude and lacked an effective validation in summary most of previous studies on dongting lake did not consider the water yields in the data scarce areas or roughly considered it without an effective verification and instead focused more on the simulation results of water level and less on the simulation results of streamflow considering this research gap we constructed coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models of the dongting lake basin to improve streamflow simulation considering the water yields of data scarce areas in the dongting lake basin the main aims of the research were as follows 1 accurately simulate and verify the streamflow in the data scarce area 2 improve the simulation accuracy of the streamflow in the hydrodynamic model 3 estimate the water yields in the data scarce areas and analyze its evolution and 4 analyze the impact of the data scarce area on the water balance of dongting lake 2 study area dongting lake is a large lake located on the yangtze river in china it plays a crucial function in water provision flood prevention and mitigation as well as ecological diversity protection dongting lake is composed of three parts west dongting lake south dongting lake and east dongting lake the main source of streamflow in dongting lake includes four rivers xiangjiang zijiang yuanjiang and lishui in the south and inflow of the yangtze river through the songzi hudu and ouchi rivers in the north and it eventually joins the yangtze river again from chenglingji the dongting lake basin consists of the xiangjiang basin the zijang basin the yuanjiang basin the lishui basin and the data scarce area downstream of the watershed fig 1 the streamflow of the xiangjiang zijang yuanjiang and lishui basins inflow from the yangtze river and the outflow of the entire dongting lake can be monitored by hydrological gauging stations the streamflow in the data scarce areas downstream of the dongting lake basin however is not monitored and often is neglected which has led to increased uncertainty in the water balance studies the area of the dongting lake basin is about 260 000 km2 and the area of the xiangjiang zijang yuanjiang and lishui basins accounts for about 80 of the total basin area the topography of the dongting lake basin is mainly mountainous and hilly the data scarce area downstream of the dongting lake basin accounts for about 20 of the basin area with some hilly areas at the edge and the rest being alluvial plains with the elevation ranging from 23 to 45 m the plain area has a complex water system and a large amount of water exchange the dongting lake basin has a typical tropical sub monsoon atmosphere with ample heat and precipitation the mean yearly precipitation is 1427 mm yr and the mean yearly temperature is 17 c 3 data and methods this research had three components hydrological modeling hydrodynamic modeling and coupling of hydrology and hydrodynamic models first we constructed a soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model of the dongting lake basin and estimated the water yield in the data scarce area of dongting lake to analyze its evolution considering the large differences in physical properties such as topography and climate among different sub basins we divided the whole dongting lake basin into the xiangjiang zijang yuanjiang and lishui basins and the data scarce area for calibration second we constructed the mike21 model of dongting lake and simulated the hydrodynamics in the initial scenario without considering the production and sink streamflow in the data scarce area third the hydrological and hydrodynamic models were coupled and set to an adjustment scenario which was compared with the initial scenario results to assess the accuracy of the coupled models meanwhile the precision of the water yields estimated in the data scarce areas was also indirectly verified furthermore we explored the effects of the data scarce area on the water balance of dongting lake the basic data required for swat consisted of the digital elevation model dem land use data soil data meteorological data and hydrological information this research used the dem data from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm with 90 m resolution which can be downloaded from the geospatial data cloud the land use data were obtained by unsupervised classification based on the 2015 landsat 8 remote sensing images obtained from the geospatial data cloud the land use types were classified into arable land forest land grassland water bodies building land and unused land soil data were collected from the world harmony soil database and the soil classification system is fao 90 the meteorological information was obtained from 121 weather stations the daily average streamflow data of nine hydrological gauging stations i e xiangtan taojiang taoyuan jinshi xinjiangkou shadaoguan mituosi kangjiagang and guanjiapu from 2009 to 2020 were obtained from the hunan hydrological and water resources survey center the data required for mike21 included topographic elevation data and hydrological data the topographic data were the actual elevation point data in 2011 at a scale of 1 5000 obtained from the hunan provincial hydrological and water resources survey center the hydrological data included daily average water level data and streamflow data at nine hydrological gauging stations i e xiangtan taojiang taoyuan jinshi zhicheng luoshan chenglingji lujiao and yingtian from 2009 to 2020 3 1 hydrological model we used the swat hydrological model to estimate the streamflow in the data scarce areas the swat hydrological model is the geographic information system gis based distributed watershed hydrological tool designed by the united states department of agriculture in 1994 this model describes the physical processes of the water cycle accurately and can be adapted to study the impacts of climate variations and human actions on water deposition and chemistry in complicated and changing situations plunge et al 2022 liu et al 2020b the swat hydrological model extracts the water system from the dem data and then divides it into several sub basins each of which is individually divided into several hydrological response units each hydrologic response unit consists of an assembly of soil land use and slope and this unit is the smallest unit of study the swat hydrological model is widely used in watershed streamflow simulation because of its strong physical mechanism which reduces the dependence on data and achieves better simulation results even in data scarce areas kanishka and eldho 2020 cibin et al 2014 we simulated the water yields in the four sub basins and the data scarce areas of the dongting lake watershed using the swat model and considered the inflow from the yangtze river in the hydrological model by adding point sources the climatic conditions and physical characteristics of the four sub basins and the data scarce areas of the dongting lake basin vary greatly chen et al 2022 zhou et al 2019 geng et al 2021 lotz et al 2018 it is difficult to apply only one set of parameters to the whole dongting lake basin hence we calibrated the hydrological model of the whole dongting lake basin according to different sub basins first calibration was performed for the xiangjiang zijang yuanjiang and lishui basins upstream of the dongting lake basin using daily average streamflow data from xiangtan taojiang taoyuan and jinshi hydrological stations respectively we performed subsequent calibration of the data scarce areas downstream of the dongting lake basin using the daily average discharge data from the chenglingji hydrological station the simulation period was 2009 2020 with 2009 2014 as the calibration period and 2015 2020 as the validation period in this study we used the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient the coefficient of determination r2 and the relative percentage error pbias to evaluate the simulation accuracy of the hydrological model sharafati and pezeshki 2020 mengistu et al 2021 loi et al 2019 we used the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi2 function of swat cup poojashree et al 2023 to perform the sensitivity analysis of the parameters and used it to select the 10 major sensitivity parameters the selected sensitive parameters were calibrated using the sufi2 method as well as the manual rate determination method the sensitivity parameters and the optimal parameter values for sub basins are shown in table 1 3 2 hydrodynamic model we used the mike21 model to conduct simulations of the hydrodynamic characteristics of dongting lake the mike21 hydrodynamic model was developed by the danish institute of hydrology it is one of a series of hydrodynamic software programs that uses a planar two dimensional mathematical model of streamflow to simulate the streamflow field characteristics of largescale water masses such as rivers lakes estuaries coasts and bays it has been used extensively in hydrodynamic water quality and sediment studies of surface waters because of its high compatibility nigussie and altunkaynak 2019 zhang et al 2022 mike21 is based on unstructured triangular meshes which can fit complex shorelines and terrain well and it also can facilitate local grid encryption for certain key areas in addition the model has the method of discriminating dry and wet water depth by setting the minimum wet and dry water depth the model can determine whether the grid is involved in the calculation and it can accurately simulate the frequent exposure and inundation process of the continental wetland this model can adapt to shallow and wide terrain and complex shorelines because of its fully physical mechanism and flexible triangular mesh profile li et al 2017 2020 in this research we used the nonstructural grid for meshing to ensure the accuracy of the calculation and to reduce the time required for the calculation the computational grid was appropriately encrypted in key research areas and areas with large topographic variations smaller grids were used in the river with a grid size of 50 300 m a larger grid was used in the dongting lake area with a grid size of 300 700 m and a total number of 238 956 grids the scope of the study area and the grid division of the hydrodynamic model are shown in fig 2 the parameter calibration of the hydrodynamic model was carried out in the initial scenario the initial scenario did not consider the water yields in the data scarce areas which is a common way to model the hydrodynamics of dongting lake the upstream flow boundary of the initial scenario was the daily average streamflow data for zhicheng xiangtan taojiang taoyuan and jinshi stations and the downstream boundary was the actual measured water level for luoshan station the parameter manning s coefficient zaifoglu et al 2019 was applied to reflect the roughness characteristics with the parameter range of 32 65 which was well calibrated by liu et al 2020 to obtain an accurate model for the hydrodynamic characteristics of dongting lake to maintain the stability of the model and to improve the computational speed the minimum time step was set to 0 01 s the drying depth was 0 005 m the flooding depth was 0 05 m and the wetting depth was 0 1 m we used daily average water level data from 2009 to 2020 at chenglingji lujiao and yingtian stations for model calibration with 2009 2014 as the calibration period and 2015 2020 as the validation period four metrics that is nse r2 pbias and root mean square error rmse were selected to evaluate the model accuracy doan et al 2019 shen et al 2020 wang et al 2021 to analyze the effect of water yields in the data scarce areas on the hydrodynamic characteristics of dongting lake we set up two simulation scenarios the initial scenario and the adjustment scenario the adjustment scenario took the water yield in the data scarce area simulated by the hydrological model as an additional input condition and the rest of the boundary conditions were the same as they were in the initial scenario the main parameter settings of the adjustment scenario were the same as they were in the initial scenario the boundaries of the two simulation scenarios are shown in table 2 and fig 3 3 3 coupling of hydrological and hydrodynamic models we used the simulated streamflow of the hydrological model in the data scarce area as an additional input condition to couple the hydrological and hydrodynamic models the coupled hydrological hydraulic model included coupling in time and space to ensure the temporal coupling we simulated both hydrological and hydrodynamic models on a daily scale to ensure spatial coupling we generated sub basins and water systems that matched the actual river conditions 3 4 sub basin division and streamflow allocation because the data scarce areas are mostly plain areas and have complex water systems the water systems automatically generated by the swat hydrological model often differ greatly from the actual situation as a result it is difficult to assign the uninformed simulated streamflow to the corresponding hydrodynamic boundaries therefore we corrected the generated water system to reflect the true river sub basin yield streamflow correction of the water system was achieved by modifying the dem elevation we used landsat 8 remote sensing images in 2015 to extract the rivers in the data scarce area and modified the dem based on the extracted rivers to complete the correction of the water system this modification should reflect the real streamflow direction and connect the actual inlet of the rivers we divided the generated sub basins into corresponding sub basin groups according to the inlet of the actual river inflow the whole data scarce area was divided into 9 sub basin groups fig 4 which correspond to 9 additional boundary conditions in the hydrodynamic model to improve the computational efficiency and reduce the data transfer time we established a data interface between the models by matlab scripts the water yield of the sub basins corresponding to the data scarce areas in the swat model was automatically extracted and directly converted into the input file of the mike21 model to participate in the calculation of the mike21 model in the form of new boundary conditions 3 5 validation of simulated streamflow in data scarce areas to further validate the streamflow simulated results in the data scarce area we established two scenarios i e the adjusted scenario and the initial scenario and set the parameters of these two scenarios to be identical in contrast to the adjusted scenario the initial scenario did not consider the water yield in the data scarce area in the adjusted scenario the simulated water yield from the data scarce area was entered as a point source inflow at the inlet of the corresponding lake we verified the simulation results of water yield in the data scarce area by validating the simulation results of the two scenarios against the observed data if the simulation accuracy of the adjusted scenario was higher than in the initial scenario it indicated that the simulation of streamflow in the data scarce area was accurate 3 6 lake water balance analysis water balance analysis is the basis of water resources planning utilization and supply and demand forecasting the existence of a large number of data scarce areas however has led to large uncertainties in water balance analysis to evaluate the effects of the data scarce area on the water balance of dongting lake we constructed a water balance equation of the lake based on the principle that the variance among the inflow and outflow would equate to the change in lake storage as follows 1 q in s ε q out where q in is the inflow to each basin s is the change in lake storage q out is the observed outflow at chenglingji station and ε is the errors in the observed data and other components such as data scarce streamflow and model uncertainty because the hydrodynamic model can simulate the sum of q in and s it is set to simulate the streamflow at chenglingji the outlet of dongting lake the initial scenario ignores the river streamflow without information the water balance equation contains only the observed streamflow at the gauging station q simout ini q xiangtan q taojiang q taoyuan q jinshi 2 q inflow from the yangtze river s 3 q s imout ini ε ini q out the adjustment scenario takes into account the streamflow in the data scarce areas q

initial scenario hydrodynamic model in chenglingji ε ini is the error in the initial scenario equation q simout adj is the adjustment of the hydrodynamic model to simulate streamflow at chenglingji ε adj is the simulation error in the adjustment scenario q xiangtan q taojiang q taoyuan and q jinshi are the streamflow values observed at xiangtan taojiang taoyuan and jinshi gauging stations respectively q inflow from the yangtze river is the streamflow from the yangtze river and q data scarce area is the streamflow simulated by the hydrological model we analyzed the impact of water yields in the data scarce areas on the water balance of dongting lake by comparing the magnitude of ε ini and ε adj values if the data scarce streamflow simulated by the swat model had sufficient accuracy the error of the adjusted scenario ε adj was smaller than that of the initial scenario ε ini 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration and validation of swat and mike21 models to accurately simulate the streamflow in the dongting lake basin the swat hydrological model and mike21 hydrodynamic model were calibrated and validated table 3 and fig 5 show the calibration and validation results of the swat model the results of five stations achieved good results with r2 and nse greater than 0 69 and pbias within 10 this result indicated the high suitability of the swat hydrological model in dongting lake basin and also the good streamflow simulation performance table 4 and fig 6 show the calibration and validation results of the mike21 hydrodynamic model the water level simulation results of three stations yingtian lujiao and chenglingji indicated that the r2 and nse were greater than 0 98 rmse was less than 0 48 m and pbias was less than 1 32 the streamflow simulation results of chenglingji station indicated that r2 was greater than 0 95 nse was greater than 0 79 and pbias was less than 24 74 the large pbias in the streamflow simulation of chenglingji station was due to the ignorance of streamflow in the data scarce areas and it was difficult to keep a highly accurate simulation of streamflow while ensuring a fixed water level calibration therefore these results indicated the high applicability of the model in dongting lake which could well simulate the hydraulic dynamic features of the lake 4 2 validation of simulated streamflow in data scarce areas we further validated streamflow simulation results in the data scarce area by comparing the simulation accuracy of the initial scenario with the adjusted scenario table 5 and fig 6 show the simulation results of the initial and adjusted scenarios the water level simulation results of three stations yingtian lujiao and chenglingji showed that the simulation accuracy of the water level in the adjustment scenario improved slightly compared with the initial scenario the downstream boundary water level condition of the model played a controlling role and the simulation results of the water level were already sufficiently good enough therefore simply increasing the streamflow in the data scarce area did not play a significant role in the improvement for the initial scenario the streamflow simulation results of chenglingji indicated that the r2 was 0 98 nse was 0 79 and pbias was 24 64 for the adjusted scenario the streamflow simulation accuracy was significantly improved with the r2 increasing to 0 98 nse increasing to 0 94 and pbias decreasing to 10 50 these results indicated that the hydrodynamic streamflow simulation was more accurate after considering the streamflow in the data scarce area therefore the streamflow simulation in the data scarce area was reasonable 4 3 analysis of the evolution pattern of water yield in data scarce areas as shown in fig 7a the maximum and minimum monthly water yields in different years differed to some extent the maximum monthly water yield in a year was distributed from april to july and the minimum monthly water yield was distributed in january and february and from september to december in the data scarce area the maximum amount of water was 10 84 10 9 m 3 in july 2016 and the minimum amount of water was 0 30 10 9 m 3 in november 2009 extreme rainfall and drought events occurred in july 2016 and november 2009 respectively as indicated by the extreme meteorological data from the china meteorological network and these extreme rainfall and drought events largely affected the water yield in the data scarce areas as shown in fig 7b the average monthly water yields in the data scarce areas revealed clear seasonal variation patterns most of the water yields in the data scarce areas occurred from april to july and the maximum water yields occurred in july 6 74 10 9 m 3 the low water yields in the data scarce areas appeared from august to march with the minimum water yields occurring in january 1 21 10 9 m 3 as shown in fig 7c the water yields in data scarce areas showed obvious interannual variability with the maximum value 50 50 10 9 m 3 in 2020 and the minimum value 21 14 10 9 m 3 in 2011 the annual water yields in the data scarce areas followed an increasing trend with a rate of 0 89 109 m3 yr the average annual water yield in the data scarce area was 38 95 10 9 m3 representing 15 13 of the overall water yield of dongting lake the annual water yields in the data scarce areas were obtained through the water balance based on the actual measurement data of the measuring station which represented 15 33 of the overall water in dongting lake and was consistent with the simulation results 4 4 influence of water yields in data scarce areas on the water balance of dongting lake fig 8a compares the water balance error with and without considering the water yields in the data scarce areas the average monthly water balance error considering the water yields in data scarce areas was 2 21 10 9 m3 which was smaller by 57 42 than that without considering the water yields in data scarce areas these results indicated that considering the water yields in the data scarce areas significantly improved the water balance of the lake although the absolute value of ε adj was greater than that of ε ini in december 2009 and january 2010 this was reasonable because extreme drought events occurred in these two months as indicated by the china meteorological network these events resulted in a small impact on the water yields of the data scarce areas on the water balance of the lake basin instead the water yields in the data scarce areas appeared to be overestimated to some extent which eventually led to an increase in the water balance error hu et al 2018 in their dongting lake water level prediction model also found that not considering rainfall in data scarce areas would result in a severe underestimation of the dongting lake water level while considering rainfall in data scarce areas would balance between underestimation and overestimation of dongting lake water level therefore it was important to consider the water yields in data scarce areas to better understand the hydrodynamic characteristics of dongting lake figs 8b and 8c show the changes in mean monthly water balance error and the amount of change in the water balance error during the flood april september and dry january march october december periods as a percentage of the year the average monthly water balance error revealed seasonal variations the change in water balance error in dongting lake basin occurred mainly in the flood seasons 73 of the year which indicated the significant improvement of streamflow simulation in flood seasons when the adjusted scenario considered the water yields in the data scarce areas fig 9 shows the magnitude of the relative change in the monthly water balance error and the proportion of total water yield in dongting lake in the data scarce areas the magnitude of error change exhibited a gradual increase from january to april the maximum value of 91 39 followed by a decline from may to september the minimum value of 30 78 and a rise again from october to december this temporal pattern of the magnitude of error change was highly consistent with that of the proportion of total water yield in dongting lake in the data scarce areas the decrease of the relative change of water balance error was more obvious in the months when the proportion of the total water yield in dongting lake in the data scarce areas was higher 5 limitation and future work in this study a simple and commonly used method was used to couple the two models i e external coupling unidirectional coupling instead of the more advanced coupling method i e full coupling bi directional coupling such a simplified method has also been used by many recent studies yang et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 the external coupling method was easy to operate and had no restriction on the choice of models so it had strong applicability several research scholars have also conducted studies on the external coupling of the swat model with the mike21 model wang and li 2015 gu 2017 some studies do exist and solved the problem of automatic data transfer or water extraction i e full coupling or bi directional coupling between two different models peng et al 2022 wu et al 2017 however those studies were not focused on the two models used in this study i e swat and mike several research scholars have also carried out studies on the full coupling of the swat model with other models or the mike model with other models larsen et al 2014 semiromi and koch 2019 which indicate that the full coupling of swat hydrological model and mike hydrodynamic model was theoretically feasible however there is a scarcity of relevant studies to achieve the full coupling of swat and mike there are currently many obstacles and challenges to achieving full coupling of swat and mike with more advanced methods for instance the numerical solutions between swat and mike have significant differences making it difficult for data conversion and transfer also the basic language requirement for swat and mike programs was different swat is based on fortran while the scripting language in the mike operations platform is ironpython the different script languages create difficulties in coupling between models efficiently in future research we will select more suitable hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling software explore how to realize real time dynamic bidirectional data transfer between hydrological and hydrodynamic models and apply the coupled models to other areas of research further improvements on streamflow simulations may be achieved in future work by using machine learning methods such as neural networks to improve the estimation of parameter values also future work may use the models for flood research firstly flood forecasting can be realized by jointly using wrf meteorological model and the coupled models in this study secondly the simulation of streamflow can be performed at a longer time scale to explore the characteristics and patterns of historical flooding events under climate change future studies may also focus on the hydrological drought characterization and the propagation relationship and mechanisms between meteorological drought and hydrological drought using the improved long term streamflow data 6 conclusion in this study we accurately simulated and verified the streamflow in the data scarce areas of dongting lake basin by coupling the hydrological model swat and the hydrodynamic model mike21 meanwhile the simulation accuracy of the streamflow in the hydrodynamic model was improved when considering the water yields in the data scarce areas of the basin the coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models had higher simulation accuracy for both water level and streamflow compared with the single hydrodynamic model most notably the relative error of streamflow simulation reduced from 24 64 to 10 50 results indicated that the average annual water yields in the data scarce areas were 38 95 10 9 m3 representing 15 13 of the overall average yearly water in the basin the water yields in the data scarce areas showed seasonal variations and were concentrated from april to july by considering the water yields in the data scarce areas the average monthly water balance error was significantly reduced by 57 42 and a higher proportion of the overall water yields in the data scarce areas led to the more obvious reduction in the relative change in water balance error the coupled modeling method utilized in this study can be widely applied to lake basins where a large number of data scarce areas exist by considering the amount of water yields in data scarce areas it is possible to significantly reduce the errors in lake water balance and provide more accurate reference values and implications for the sustainable use of lake water and the planning of water conservation projects credit authorship

7688,study region the study region is the coastal tra vinh province located in mekong delta vietnam study focus the objective of the study is to design preliminary monitoring networks for groundwater level and salinity monitoring in the three heavily abstracted aquifers in the tra vinh province since data from the existing monitoring were insufficient to explore variogram analysis and subsequent kriging interpolation for the network design groundwater flow and saltwater transport models were constructed to create groundwater level and salinity distributions an iterative procedure was adopted to select monitoring well locations based on the contour maps of groundwater levels and total dissolved solids tds constructed from the groundwater models the standard deviation of kriging interpolation error was used as the criteria to assess the quality of the designed monitoring networks priorities for the locating groundwater level monitoring wells were targeted in areas with cones of depression and boundaries while priorities for salinity monitoring were given to coastal zone and inland fresh saltwater interfaces new hydrological insights for the region groundwater overexploitation has resulted in storage depletion and saltwater intrusion in the tra vinh province simulations from the numerical models determined the cones of the depression and predicted intrusion from inland saltwater trapped in clays from past marine transgressions and from seawater in the coastal zone a limited number of monitoring wells is operated and is insufficient to delineate the cone of depression and fresh salt water interfaces this study combined the numerical model simulation results and kriging interpolation method and designed preliminary groundwater level and salinity monitoring networks for the tra vinh province once the designed networks are implemented observed data from the networks will provide valuable information for sustainable groundwater resources

the variance or standard deviation of the interpolation error hernández stefanoni et al 2011 venkatramanan et al 2019 the kriging method has been applied to analyze groundwater level monitoring networks in many cases for example northwest kansas sophocleous et al 1982 china chao et al 2011 yang et al 2008 zhou et al 2013 wainganga sub basin india chandan and yashwant 2017 and the netherlands

saxony anhalt germany thakur 2015 the referred studies often base their optimization of the monitoring network on existing observation wells and corresponding data when such data are scarce additional methods are required to support the understanding of the conceptual models of freshwater occurrence recharge and discharge as well as saltwater intrusion the objective of the current research is to design preliminary monitoring networks for groundwater level and salinity monitoring in the three heavily abstracted aquifers located in the tra vinh province in the mekong delta supported by the information obtained from groundwater flow and saltwater transport models the latter are applied to produce contour maps of groundwater levels and distribution of total dissolved solids tds for the three most important aquifers in the study area to complement the incomplete data of actual measurements of groundwater level and salinity during field campaigns the obtained maps of groundwater level and salinity distribution were subsequently used to select the locations and numbers of monitoring points based on monitoring criteria the kriging interpolation method was applied to reproduce groundwater level and salinity contour maps based on the proposed monitoring networks whereas the kriging standard deviation was used to evaluate the spatial representability of the proposed monitoring network finally based on the results a priority list of monitoring wells was recommended for monitoring network implementation and management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and hydrogeology the study was conducted in tra vinh province located in the coastal area of mekong delta fig 1 the province has 65 km of coastline between two large rivers the hau river and the co chien river these two rivers supply fresh water deposit alluvial sediments and are important waterways linking the ports in tra vinh the annual average precipitation in the northeast is around 1500 mm a while it rises to 1700 mm per year in the southwest mai et al 2014 the wet season typically last from april to november with the whole province receiving approximate 90 of the annual rainfall severe droughts have impacted all provinces of the mekong delta in 1985 2018 quang et al 2021 temperatures are relatively constant through the year with an average of 27 c the tra vinh province covers an area of 2341 km2 and is very flat with elevations just above mean sea level in most areas with slight elevations of a few meters above mean sea level occurring only in sand dunes and roads fig 1 as the distinguishing characteristic of the mekong delta basin fill the stratigraphy in the tra vinh area was formed during the process of transgression and regression events nguyen et al 2004 van pham et al 2019 the process lasts from the late neogene miocene pliocene up to the holocene period in which the sediment of the stratigraphy has resulted in seven heterogeneous formations in each formation there are two parts the upper part with low permeability consists of silt clay or silty clay aquitards and the lower part with high permeability aquifers which includes fine to coarse sand minderhoud et al 2017 van pham et al 2019 vuong 2013 the aquifers are namely holocene qh upper pleistocene qp3 upper middle pleistocene qp2 3 lower pleistocene qp1 middle pliocene n2 2 lower pliocene n2 1 upper miocene n1 3 and broadly distributed in the area with a thickness of 15 m to more than 50 m deltares 2011 dwrpis 2009 the two cross sections fig 2 nw se extending from the north to the coast and sw ne going from tien river to hau river provide an overview of the spatial distribution and interconnection of aquifer and aquitard systems in the tra vinh area van hiep and van long 2017 aquifer media are composed of sand and gravel with a mixture of clay and silt with medium to low water transmitting capacity table 1 groundwater quality in the holocene aquifer qh is generally below the water quality standard due to the influence from the land use activities bui et al 2017 the most developed aquifers are the upper pleistocene aquifer qp3 and upper middle pleistocene aquifer qp2 3 2 2 status of groundwater use and issues in the mekong delta groundwater is partially used in aquaculture and is widely used for domestic and industrial purposes since 2000s in the period of 2004 and 2008 groundwater abstraction almost doubled due to a rapid growth in number of households using groundwater for domestic activities sanh 2010 the most recent report showed that about 224 773 m3 day of groundwater was abstracted in whole province mainly from qp3 20 and qp2 3 aquifers 70 with a small amount exploited from the upper qh aquifer and deeper qp1 aquifer other aquifers n2 2 n2 1 and n1 3 have not yet been exploited vuong 2013 the total number of abstraction wells is about 88 927 of which 114 have a capacity 200 m3 day registered wells and the majority 88 813 with capacity 200 m3 day non registered wells because of the rapid population growth and fast economic development in the mekong delta surface water resources were unable to meet the demands and groundwater was overexploited ha et al 2015 resulting groundwater depletion and saline water intrusion are the main problems that threaten drinking water supplies farming systems and livelihoods in the delta especially in a coastal province such as tra vinh vuong 2013 besides land subsidence is estimated to be about 20 cm for the cities of tra vinh due to the impact of 25 years of groundwater extraction minderhoud et al 2017 2 3 current groundwater monitoring network groundwater levels in tra vinh province have been monitored since 1994 as the groundwater started to be exploited in mekong delta currently there are only six groundwater monitoring stations consisting of 13 monitoring wells fig 1 and table 1 operated by the national center of water resources planning and investigation nawapi to observe both groundwater quality and level in different aquifers of tra vinh province most monitoring wells are now equipped with automatic data loggers to measure the groundwater level every hour monitoring wells are installed and operated from shallowest to deepest aquifers except for the lower pleistocene aquifer however there are less than 2 monitoring wells per aquifer even for the middle pleistocene aquifer which contributes up to 70 of the total amount of groundwater abstraction in the province groundwater quality analysis is conducted twice per year to analyze the level of major ions ca2 mg2 na k cl hco3 so4 2 and no3 along the coastline where abstractions can be directly affected by seawater intrusion no monitoring wells exist for groundwater level or quality 2 4 methods the methodology used for the design of groundwater level and salinity monitoring networks for tra vinh province is shown in the fig 3 since existing groundwater monitoring wells are very limited a combination of groundwater modeling and geostatistical methods was used first a conceptual hydrogeological model was constructed with data from various sources then a 3d transient groundwater flow model was constructed and calibrated with groundwater time series from 11 monitoring wells a 3d saltwater transport model was constructed and checked with salinity measurements carried out during a number of field campaigns contour maps of groundwater levels and salinity distribution were prepared from the models afterwards fictitious monitoring locations wells were selected and groundwater level and salinity values were read from these contour maps of groundwater levels and salinity distribution from selected monitoring wells kriging methods were used to fit variogram models and construct contour maps of groundwater levels and salinity and standard deviation of interpolation errors if needed locations of monitoring wells were adjusted or additional monitoring wells were added to update and assess the monitoring network configuration once the interpolated contour maps from fictitious monitoring wells resembled contour maps of groundwater level and salinity from the models and standard deviation of interpolation errors was smaller than the threshold value a priority list of monitoring wells for stepwise implementation was defined the fictitious wells would need to be constructed in the case of groundwater level monitoring but in the case of salinity monitoring the wells could be selected among the many private wells installed in the three aquifers 2 4 1 salinity measurements field campaigns of ec measurements were carried out at a large number of domestic wells in the tra vinh province in the years of 2017 2018 and 2019 for the upper three aquifers students from ho chi minh city university of technology were mobilized to measure ec values with ec meters guided by university lecturers local youth and women unions participated in the monitoring campaigns the number of ec measurements were 756 86 and 180 in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively spatial distribution maps of groundwater salinity were created to delineate the interfaces of fresh salt water in these three aquifers subsequently a number of monitoring wells were assigned along the interfaces to observe the changes of tds concentration monthly a participatory salinity monitoring program was established in tra vinh province 2 4 2 construction of groundwater models the objectives of the numerical groundwater modeling were to enhance understanding of the conceptual model and provide a first estimate of spatial temporal variations of groundwater levels gwls and salinity distribution under scarce measurements the groundwater flow and saltwater intrusion models were constructed with popular model codes modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 and seawat dausman et al 2009 the models were constructed with a conceptual model approach in groundwater modeling system gms10 4 kumar 2012 zhou and li 2011 the models consisted of 13 model layers corresponding to 7 aquifers and 6 aquitards the model grid is uniform with cell size of 500 by 500 m model boundaries included coastal line two rivers and upstream province boundary which were all simulated as head dependent flow boundaries the hydrological stresses included recharge from precipitation infiltration in the top unconfined aquifer interactions with surface water and groundwater extractions the models were transient from 2007 to 2018 with monthly stress period in the groundwater flow model time series of gwl at 11 monitoring wells were compared with simulated gwl during the calibration process fig 1 in this process hydraulic parameters were adjusted to calibrate the model and obtain the best fit to observed gwl fluctuations based on the trial and error method the saltwater transport model included advection dispersion and density variations the sources of saltwater were seawater and saltwater entrapped in the aquifers the initial tds concentrations of the fresh and saline groundwater were assigned based on the kriging interpolation maps of the dataset of ec measurements and a spatial distribution map of saline groundwater was created to define the interface of fresh salt water in three shallowest aquifers similarly the trial and error method was applied to calibrate the salinity model based on the dataset of ec measurements and 1 5 years data of tds observations at 5 locations of the qp2 3 aquifer fig 1 during the calibration process longitudinal dispersion and effective porosity were adjusted to obtain reasonable agreement between computed tds and monitoring ones the details of modeling are described in another manuscript van et al 2023 2 4 3 selection of locations of monitoring wells the main objectives of gwl monitoring are to characterize the regional groundwater regime to assess impacts of groundwater abstractions to identify interactions with surface water and to detect trend of groundwater level declines contour maps of groundwater levels from the modflow model provided the spatial distribution of groundwater levels cones of depression and relations to surface water therefore these contour maps were used to select fictitious monitoring wells for the intensively abstracted aquifers at the cones of depression near and perpendicular to rivers and the coastline as well as in urban areas fictitious monitoring wells were selected and groundwater level values were read from the modflow model cells furthermore a denser monitoring network for instance one monitoring well per 10 25 km2 in the coastal area was considered to be necessary to monitor hydraulic head variations as negative heads here could result in seawater intrusion jousma et al 2006 the main objectives of groundwater salinity monitoring are to delineate saline groundwater distribution to monitor saltwater migration and to detect trend of salinity increase the contour maps of tds distribution from the seawat model provided locations of saltwater distribution and seawater intrusion these contour maps were used to locate wells for salinity monitoring target monitoring wells were selected from fresh saltwater transition zones and saltwater intrusion zones representative wells were also selected in areas with different salinity levels tds values were read at locations of these fictitious wells from the seawat model cells 2 4 4 construction of contour maps with kriging interpolation method kriging is a spatial interpolation method that builds on the geostatistical principle of regionalized variables oliver 2010 the interpolated value is a weighted average of the measurements as 1 z 0 i 1 n λ 0 i z i where z 0 is the interpolated value at the location x 0 z i is the measurement at the location x i i 1 2 n n is the number of measurements λ0 i is the kriging weighting coefficients associated with the location x 0 the kriging weighting coefficients can be found from the kriging system equations 2a j 1 n λ 0 j γ x i x j μ γ x i x 0 i 1 n 2b i 1 n λ 0 i 1 where γ d is called the semi variogram or simply variogram d is the distance between two locations x i and x j the variance of the interpolation error is computed as 3 v a r z 0 z 0 i 1 n λ 0 i γ x i x 0 μ the variogram function is usually identified with the measurements for groundwater levels a linear function is usually defined as 4 γ d c 0 θ d where c 0 is the nugget effect and θ is the slope of the linear function sometimes exponential function may be used 5 γ d c 0 c 1 1 e d α where c 0 c 1 is the sill value which is the variogram value for very large distance α is the correlation length kriging interpolation error was often used as a criterion for monitoring network design zhou et al 2013 in this study ordinary kriging in surfer software bresnahan and dickenson 2002 was used to re construct contour maps of groundwater levels and salinity groundwater level and salinity values at fictitious monitoring wells were obtained from the models and used to fit variogram models and create contour maps of groundwater level and salinity and interpolation errors when monitoring wells were properly chosen constructed contour maps of groundwater levels and salinity should resemble the contour maps from modflow and seawat models furthermore standard deviation of interpolation error should be smaller than a threshold value the threshold values for groundwater level and tds were considered as 1 0 m and 500 mg l respectively the maximum root mean square error of the model calibration is 0 6 m van et al 2023 therefore a threshold value for the groundwater level is chosen as 1 0 m for tds the threshold value should be less than fresh saltwater interface 1000 mg l therefore a value of 500 mg l is chosen so that the interpolation accuracy is high enough to determine the interface 2 4 5 design procedures an iterative procedure was used to select a minimum number of monitoring wells starting with a small number of monitoring wells contour maps were compared and the interpolation error was checked new monitoring wells were added at locations where contour maps show large differences and the interpolation error is larger than threshold values when both criteria were satisfied designed monitoring wells were distributed among different levels of priority for stepwise implementation first initial monitoring wells were determined based on the hydrogeological conditions topography and abstractions groundwater levels and tds at the designed wells were read from the corresponding cell values of the groundwater flow and saltwater transport models second a variogram model was fitted with the designed well locations and computed groundwater levels and tds third contour maps of groundwater levels and tds and standard deviation of interpolation error were constructed with kriging interpolation method fourth the similarity of groundwater level and tds contour maps from kriging interpolation was compared with the contour map from the groundwater flow and saltwater transport models standard deviation of interpolation error was checked with the threshold value fifth new observation wells were added in areas where the contour maps of groundwater levels and tds from the kriging interpolation are different from models and or standard deviations are higher than the threshold values then steps 2 5 were repeated until a satisfactory monitoring network was designed 3 results and discussion 3 1 design of groundwater level monitoring network the holocene aquifer qh is unconfined interacts with rivers and receives recharge from precipitation infiltration a smaller cone of depression was formed in the northwest area due to intensive groundwater abstractions in underling aquifers fig 4a therefore it is important to monitor groundwater levels in this aquifer even though the aquifer is not intensively abstracted for water supply due to lower permeability and limited thickness with the above mentioned iterative procedure 30 observation wells were selected blue points in fig 4a including 3 existing wells groundwater levels at these fictitious wells were read from the model cell values the variogram analysis identified a linear variogram model with a slope of 0 0002 and no nugget effect see supplementary material the contour map from the kriging interpolation was shown in fig 4b which is similar as the contour map from the groundwater model in fig 4a furthermore contour map of the standard deviation of the interpolation error is smaller than 1 0 m in most important areas fig 7a it is higher than 1 0 m in some areas where a larger error is accepted where no groundwater abstraction takes place and nor important hydrogeological conditions present intensive groundwater abstraction takes place in the upper pleistocene aquifer qp3 contour map of groundwater levels from the model fig 5a shows a large cone of depression is formed at the west area the computed groundwater levels along the coast are slightly below the sea level so that seawater intrusion may occur 28 observation wells include one existing well were finally selected to monitor the cone of depression seawater intrusion and groundwater levels along the boundary a linear variogram model was fitted with a slope of 0 00012 and no nugget effect the contour map from the kriging interpolation was shown in fig 5b resembling the contour map from the groundwater model in fig 5a furthermore contour map of the standard deviation of the interpolation error is smaller than 1 5 m in all areas fig 7b the upper middle pleistocene aquifer qp2 3 is also intensively exploited for water supply contour map of groundwater levels also shows a large cone of depression with lower groundwater level in the west area a smaller cone of the depression occurs in the coastal area groundwater in this aquifer comes mainly from the leakage of the aquifers above 28 observation wells include two existing wells were finally selected to monitor the cone of depression seawater intrusion and groundwater levels along the boundary a linear variogram model was fitted with a slope of 0 00011 and no nugget effect the contour map from the kriging interpolation was shown in fig 6b resembling the contour map from the groundwater model in fig 6a contour map of the standard deviation of the interpolation error is smaller than 1 2 m in all areas fig 7c 3 2 design of groundwater salinity monitoring network the tds contour map interpolated from 412 ec measurements in the qp2 3 aquifer in 2017 is shown in fig 8a together with the model computed contour map fig 8b in the same period they show similar distributions the highest salinities in the northeast and the freshwater occurring in a large part of the area also near the coast this shows the predominant source of old saltwater in the aquifer trapped during marine transgressions and modern seawater intrusion occurs in the coast at the wedge shaped interface for the other aquifers the model and observed values also correspond quite well van et al 2023 the results of the seawat model also indicated that there is an increasing saline area in all aquifers except for the qh aquifer in the holocene aquifer qh saltwater is distributed in a large portion of the province area except for the fresh water lenses in sand dune areas the tds concentration of the qh aquifer fluctuates seasonally due to direct recharge from rainfall subsequently a preliminary groundwater salinity monitoring network was also designed for the tra vinh province focusing on top three aquifers we used the same iterative procedure as for the design of groundwater level monitoring network however monitoring wells were selected from existing pumping wells for salinity monitoring so no new monitoring wells are to be installed contour maps of tds computed by seawat model in march 2016 were used as basic maps to select potential monitoring wells for the top 3 aquifers fig 9a fig 10a and fig 11a through a number of trial and error iterations the final number of selected monitoring wells are 57 59 and 74 for the holocene aquifer qh upper pleistocene aquifer qp3 and upper middle pleistocene aquifer qp2 3 respectively table 2 linear variogram models were identified for qh qp3 and qp2 3 aquifers with a slope of 27 23 and 42 and no nugget effect respectively the constructed contour maps of groundwater tds with kriging interpolation from the selected monitoring wells fig 9b fig 10b and fig 11b using the fitted variogram models resemble the contour maps from the seawat model in the coastline two rows of wells parallel to the coastline were selected in order to monitor the seawater intrusion similarly at the inland fresh salt water interfaces two parallel wells were selected to monitor the migration of the interface due to groundwater abstraction the standard deviation of kriging interpolation error is smaller than 500 mg l threshold value in qh qp3 and qp2 3 aquifers fig 12 however the standard deviation of interpolation error is larger in the middle pleistocene qp2 3 aquifer since the variogram has a larger slope in conclusion these selected monitoring wells consist of a good preliminary groundwater salinity monitoring network for the tra vinh province 3 3 priority of implementation installation of groundwater monitoring wells is very expensive so a stepwise implementation approach is recommended monitoring wells were divided in two categories of priorities for implementing the groundwater level monitoring the first category includes 53 monitoring wells which are distributed at depression cones and along provincial boundaries table 2 there were 27 monitoring wells of the second category located in other areas of the three different aquifers in case of implementing the salinity monitoring network 110 monitoring wells were identified in the first category of priorities which focus on the fresh saline interface the coastline and the province boundaries the second category includes 80 monitoring wells distributed following the salinity distribution of the three aquifers table 2 pumping wells at the designed locations of monitoring wells can be selected for monitoring groundwater salinity with ec meters participatory monitoring by local stakeholders can be established for salinity monitoring farmers water supply companies youth and women unions are to be attracted to monitor groundwater salinity voluntarily 3 4 discussion groundwater in the coastal aquifers provide essential domestic water supply for tra vinh province limited groundwater recharge and existence of saltwater distribution and potential seawater intrusion are threatening sustainable development of groundwater resources current groundwater level and salinity monitoring is limited and insufficient to characterize the regional groundwater regime to delineate the cones of depression and the spatial distribution of saltwater the existent monitoring wells are also not able to representatively detect the trend of groundwater level decline and increase of salinity systematic monitoring networks for groundwater level and salinity are urgently required for the security of domestic water supply as a start preliminary monitoring networks with a minimum number of monitoring wells should be designed to initiate the monitoring process the networks can be further optimized later on when sufficient data are collected from the preliminary networks zhou et al 2013 since there is not enough information available for the design of preliminary monitoring networks in the tra vinh province groundwater models were constructed and used to provide contour maps of groundwater levels and salinity tds so that potential monitoring locations could be selected from the contour maps following hydrogeological considerations values of groundwater levels and tds can then be read from these contour maps at locations of selected monitoring wells the kriging interpolation method revealed capable of analyzing the monitoring network configurations and assessing the minimum number of wells necessary to re construct the contour maps they further allowed computing interpolation errors and using these in the assessment the similarity between these contour maps and interpolation error provided the criteria to select proper locations for the set up of preliminary monitoring networks this methodology has been applied in several other case studies chao et al 2011 nabi et al 2011 ohmer et al 2019 sheikhy narany et al 2014 yang et al 2008 the contour maps of groundwater levels from the modflow model clearly show that regional cones of depression are formed in the three aquifers groundwater levels are below sea level triggering flow of inland saltwater towards the wells and possible seawater intrusion near the coast alfarrah and walraevens 2018 badaruddin et al 2015 costall et al 2020 in addition groundwater recharge may be induced from surface waters da costa et al 2019 döll et al 2012 jinno et al 2009 therefore priorities for groundwater level monitoring should target these areas monitoring wells defined as first priority should be installed first measurements from these new monitoring wells can validate the model results and further help to calibrate the modflow model the computed groundwater levels from the improved model can then be used to adjust locations of monitoring wells in the second priority list iterations between the groundwater modeling and monitoring can lead to an optimal monitoring network and a reliable model as a tool for the planning and management of groundwater resources development chadalavada et al 2012 lal and datta 2019 sreekanth and datta 2014 zhou et al 2013 contour maps of groundwater salinity tds from the seawat model indicate limited seawater intrusion in the coastal area and the existence of saltwater in inland areas these saltwater areas have been confirmed from salinity monitoring campaigns at pumping wells in 2017 it is relatively easier to monitor groundwater salinity from a large number of monitoring wells pumping wells with the well screen located in a specific aquifer can be selected for measuring salinity with ec meters owners of wells are interested to measure ec values as volunteers within a framework of participatory monitoring systems awareness education and training of using ec meters should be provided to volunteers office 2011 prouteau and wolff 2008 a protocol of quality control system is also important additional ec measurements can be obtained from groundwater level monitoring wells when installed it is not necessary to measure ec values with a high frequency since groundwater salinity only shows gradual changes ec measurements of twice a year one in dry period december april and one in raining period may november are good practice to begin with intensive measurements of ec values can also help to improve saltwater transport model faneca sànchez et al 2015 guo et al 2019 shin and hwang 2020 and support the use of this tool for salinity control and mitigation abd elhamid et al 2020 altalmas 2012 huang and chiu 2018 hussain et al 2019 4 conclusions groundwater monitoring networks for tra vinh province were designed for monitoring of groundwater level and salinity for groundwater resources management and safety of drinking water supply in particular since only a few groundwater monitoring wells exist groundwater models were used to simulate groundwater level and salinity distributions based on contour maps of groundwater level and salinity constructed from models monitoring wells were selected following the criteria of network design in the coastal area using kriging method the groundwater level monitoring network designed for tra vinh province consists of 80 monitoring wells for three shallow aquifers thirteen wells are located along the coastline and boundaries of the province to identify cross boundary flow eleven monitoring wells are distributed in the regional cones of depression twenty seven monitoring wells are scattered evenly in the aquifers in order to construct contour maps of groundwater levels with similar accuracy the standard deviation of the interpolation error from the designed monitoring network varies from 0 2 to 1 4 m tds contour maps were constructed with the saltwater transport model and provided the distribution of fresh and saline groundwater in tra vinh province revealing that saltwater is mostly present in the northeastern area in the main aquifers a denser network of salinity monitoring was designed with 190 wells for three shallow aquifers a large number of salinity monitoring wells are located along the coastline and inland fresh salt water interfaces a considerable amount of monitoring wells was designed along main tds contour lines of 1500 mg l and 500 mg l for assessing the risk of salinization of drinking water wells the standard deviation of interpolation error is less than 500 mg l in all 3 aquifers professional monitoring wells for groundwater level monitoring are preferred since water levels in pumping wells are not representative for water levels in the aquifer however pumping wells provide easy access for salinity monitoring when well screens are located in a specific aquifer owners of the wells can be recruited as volunteer observers for salinity monitoring equipped with an ec meter the designed monitoring wells can be installed in a stepwise manner following the priority lists groundwater level monitoring wells in the areas of significant groundwater drawdown should be given high priority for controlling aquifer depletion

7688,study region the study region is the coastal tra vinh province located in mekong delta vietnam study focus the objective of the study is to design preliminary monitoring networks for groundwater level and salinity monitoring in the three heavily abstracted aquifers in the tra vinh province since data from the existing monitoring were insufficient to explore variogram analysis and subsequent kriging interpolation for the network design groundwater flow and saltwater transport models were constructed to create groundwater level and salinity distributions an iterative procedure was adopted to select monitoring well locations based on the contour maps of groundwater levels and total dissolved solids tds constructed from the groundwater models the standard deviation of kriging interpolation error was used as the criteria to assess the quality of the designed monitoring networks priorities for the locating groundwater level monitoring wells were targeted in areas with cones of depression and boundaries while priorities for salinity monitoring were given to coastal zone and inland fresh saltwater interfaces new hydrological insights for the region groundwater overexploitation has resulted in storage depletion and saltwater intrusion in the tra vinh province simulations from the numerical models determined the cones of the depression and predicted intrusion from inland saltwater trapped in clays from past marine transgressions and from seawater in the coastal zone a limited number of monitoring wells is operated and is insufficient to delineate the cone of depression and fresh salt water interfaces this study combined the numerical model simulation results and kriging interpolation method and designed preliminary groundwater level and salinity monitoring networks for the tra vinh province once the designed networks are implemented observed data from the networks will provide valuable information for sustainable groundwater resources

principally used for identifying hydrological tresses and assess the impact of these stress on other hydrogeological components and groundwater recharge discharge and storage taylor and alley 2002 groundwater quality monitoring can assess quality status and long term trends of quality changes broers et al 2009 jeon et al 2020 in many countries around the world groundwater quantity and quality monitoring is conducted at a local scale and regional scale or national scale daughney et al 2012 geophysical and geochemical data of the aquifers and their water resources provide the necessary

fallatah 2018 hydrogeological geostatistical and modeling approaches or interactive visualization for monitoring network optimization are methods used to design groundwater monitoring networks based on published references thakur 2015 zhou et al 2013 within the geostatistical method the kriging interpolation method has been widely used since it is not only the best interpolator but also provides the variance or standard deviation of the interpolation error hernández stefanoni et al 2011 venkatramanan et al 2019 the kriging method has been applied to analyze groundwater level monitoring networks in many cases for example northwest kansas sophocleous et al 1982 china chao et al 2011 yang et al 2008 zhou et al 2013 wainganga sub basin india chandan and yashwant 2017 and the netherlands thakur 2015 van bracht and romijn 1985 geostatistical method based on kriging interpolation was applied to identify essential priority and additional monitoring wells in bitterfeld federal state of saxony anhalt germany thakur 2015 the referred studies often base their optimization of the monitoring network on existing observation wells and corresponding data when such data are scarce additional methods are required to support the understanding of the conceptual models of freshwater occurrence recharge and discharge as well as saltwater intrusion the objective of the current research is to design preliminary monitoring networks for groundwater level and salinity monitoring in the three heavily abstracted aquifers located in the tra vinh province in the mekong delta supported by the information obtained from groundwater flow and saltwater transport models the latter are applied to produce contour maps of groundwater levels and distribution of total dissolved solids tds for the three most important aquifers in the study area to complement the incomplete data of actual measurements of groundwater level and salinity during field campaigns the obtained maps of groundwater level and salinity distribution were subsequently used to select the locations and numbers of monitoring points based on monitoring criteria the kriging interpolation method was applied to reproduce groundwater level and salinity contour maps based on the proposed monitoring networks whereas the kriging standard deviation was used to evaluate the spatial representability of the proposed monitoring network finally based on the results a priority list of monitoring wells was recommended for monitoring network implementation and management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and hydrogeology the study was conducted in tra vinh province located in the coastal area of mekong delta fig 1 the province has 65 km of coastline between two large rivers the hau river and the co chien river these two rivers supply fresh water deposit alluvial sediments and are important waterways linking the ports in tra vinh the annual average precipitation in the northeast is around 1500 mm a while it rises to 1700 mm per year in the southwest mai et al 2014 the wet season typically last from april to november with the whole province receiving approximate 90 of the annual rainfall severe droughts have impacted all provinces of the mekong delta in 1985 2018 quang et al 2021 temperatures are relatively constant through the year with an average of 27 c the tra vinh province covers an area of 2341 km2 and is very flat with elevations just above mean sea level in most areas with slight elevations of a few meters above mean sea level occurring only in sand dunes and roads fig 1 as the distinguishing characteristic of the mekong delta basin fill the stratigraphy in the tra vinh area was formed during the process of transgression and regression events nguyen et al 2004 van pham et al 2019 the process lasts from the late neogene miocene pliocene up to the holocene period in which the sediment of the stratigraphy has resulted in seven heterogeneous formations in each formation there are two parts the upper part with low permeability consists of silt clay or silty clay aquitards and the lower part with high permeability aquifers which includes fine to coarse sand minderhoud et al 2017 van pham et al 2019 vuong 2013 the aquifers are namely holocene qh upper pleistocene qp3 upper middle pleistocene qp2 3 lower pleistocene qp1 middle pliocene n2 2 lower pliocene n2 1 upper miocene n1 3 and broadly distributed in the area with a thickness of 15 m to more than 50 m deltares 2011 dwrpis 2009 the two cross sections fig 2 nw se extending from the north to the coast and sw ne going from tien river to hau river provide an overview of the spatial distribution and interconnection of aquifer and aquitard systems in the tra vinh area van hiep and van long 2017 aquifer media are composed of sand and gravel with a mixture of clay and silt with medium to low water transmitting capacity table 1 groundwater quality in the holocene aquifer qh is generally below the water quality standard due to the influence from the land use activities bui et al 2017 the most developed aquifers are the upper pleistocene aquifer qp3 and upper middle pleistocene aquifer qp2 3 2 2 status of groundwater use and issues in the mekong delta groundwater is partially used in aquaculture and is widely used for domestic and industrial purposes since 2000s in the period of 2004 and 2008 groundwater abstraction almost doubled due to a rapid growth in number of households using groundwater for domestic activities sanh 2010 the most recent report showed that about 224 773 m3 day of groundwater was abstracted in whole province mainly from qp3 20 and qp2 3 aquifers 70 with a small amount exploited from the upper qh aquifer and deeper qp1 aquifer other aquifers n2 2 n2 1 and n1 3 have not yet been exploited vuong 2013 the total number of abstraction wells is about 88 927 of which 114 have a capacity 200 m3 day registered wells and the majority 88 813 with capacity 200 m3 day non registered wells because of the rapid population growth and fast economic development in the mekong delta surface water resources were unable to meet the demands and groundwater was overexploited ha et al 2015 resulting groundwater depletion and saline water intrusion are the main problems that threaten drinking water supplies farming systems and livelihoods in the delta especially in a coastal province such as tra vinh vuong 2013 besides land subsidence is estimated to be about 20 cm for the cities of tra vinh due to the impact of 25 years of groundwater extraction minderhoud et al 2017 2 3 current groundwater monitoring network groundwater levels in tra vinh province have been monitored since 1994 as the groundwater started to be exploited in mekong delta currently there are only six groundwater monitoring stations consisting of 13 monitoring wells fig 1 and table 1 operated by the national center of water resources planning and investigation nawapi to observe both groundwater quality and level in different aquifers of tra vinh province most monitoring wells are now equipped with automatic data loggers to measure the groundwater level every hour monitoring wells are installed and operated from shallowest to deepest aquifers except for the lower pleistocene aquifer however there are less than 2 monitoring wells per aquifer even for the middle pleistocene aquifer which contributes up to 70 of the total amount of groundwater abstraction in the province groundwater quality analysis is conducted twice per year to analyze the level of major ions ca2 mg2 na k cl hco3 so4 2 and no3 along the coastline where abstractions can be directly affected by seawater intrusion no monitoring wells exist for groundwater level or quality 2 4 methods the methodology used for the design of groundwater level and salinity monitoring networks for tra vinh province is shown in the fig 3 since existing groundwater monitoring wells are very limited a combination of groundwater modeling and geostatistical methods was used first a conceptual hydrogeological model was constructed with data from various sources then a 3d transient groundwater flow model was constructed and calibrated with groundwater time series from 11 monitoring wells a 3d saltwater transport model was constructed and checked with salinity measurements carried out during a number of field campaigns contour maps of groundwater levels and salinity distribution were prepared from the models afterwards fictitious monitoring locations wells were selected and groundwater level and salinity values were read from these contour maps of groundwater levels and salinity distribution from selected monitoring wells kriging methods were used to fit variogram models and construct contour maps of groundwater levels and salinity and standard deviation of interpolation errors if needed locations of monitoring wells were adjusted or additional monitoring wells were added to update and assess the monitoring network configuration once the interpolated contour maps from fictitious monitoring wells resembled contour maps of groundwater level and salinity from the models and standard deviation of interpolation errors was smaller than the threshold value a priority list of monitoring wells for stepwise implementation was defined the fictitious wells would need to be constructed in the case of groundwater level monitoring but in the case of salinity monitoring the wells could be selected among the many private wells installed in the three aquifers 2 4 1 salinity measurements field campaigns of ec measurements were carried out at a large number of domestic wells in the tra vinh province in the years of 2017 2018 and 2019 for the upper three aquifers students from ho chi minh city university of technology were mobilized to measure ec values with ec meters guided by university lecturers local youth and women unions participated in the monitoring campaigns the number of ec measurements were 756 86 and 180 in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively spatial distribution maps of groundwater salinity were created to delineate the interfaces of fresh salt water in these three aquifers subsequently a number of monitoring wells were assigned along the interfaces to observe the changes of tds concentration monthly a participatory salinity monitoring program was established in tra vinh province 2 4 2 construction of groundwater models the objectives of the numerical groundwater modeling were to enhance understanding of the conceptual model and provide a first estimate of spatial temporal variations of groundwater levels gwls and salinity distribution under scarce measurements the groundwater flow and saltwater intrusion models were constructed with popular model codes modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 and seawat dausman et al 2009 the models were constructed with a conceptual model approach in groundwater modeling system gms10 4 kumar 2012 zhou and li 2011 the models consisted of 13 model layers corresponding to 7 aquifers and 6 aquitards the model grid is uniform with cell size of 500 by 500 m model boundaries included coastal line two rivers and upstream province boundary which were all simulated as head dependent flow boundaries the hydrological stresses included recharge from precipitation infiltration in the top unconfined aquifer interactions with surface water and groundwater extractions the models were transient from 2007 to 2018 with monthly stress period in the groundwater flow model time series of gwl at 11 monitoring wells were compared with simulated gwl during the calibration process fig 1 in this process hydraulic parameters were adjusted to calibrate the model and obtain the best fit to observed gwl fluctuations based on the trial and error method the saltwater transport model included advection dispersion and density variations the sources of saltwater were seawater and saltwater entrapped in the aquifers the initial tds concentrations of the fresh and saline groundwater were assigned based on the kriging interpolation maps of the dataset of ec measurements and a spatial distribution map of saline groundwater was created to define the interface of fresh salt water in three shallowest aquifers similarly the trial and error method was applied to calibrate the salinity model based on the dataset of ec measurements and 1 5 years data of tds observations at 5 locations of the qp2 3 aquifer fig 1 during the calibration process longitudinal dispersion and effective porosity were adjusted to obtain reasonable agreement between computed tds and monitoring ones the details of modeling are described in another manuscript van et al 2023 2 4 3 selection of locations of monitoring wells the main objectives of gwl monitoring are to characterize the regional groundwater regime to assess impacts of groundwater abstractions to identify interactions with surface water and to detect trend of groundwater level declines contour maps of groundwater levels from the modflow model provided the spatial distribution of groundwater levels cones of depression and relations to surface water therefore these contour maps were used to select fictitious monitoring wells for the intensively abstracted aquifers at the cones of depression near and perpendicular to rivers and the coastline as well as in urban areas fictitious monitoring wells were selected and groundwater level values were read from the modflow model cells furthermore a denser monitoring network for instance one monitoring well per 10 25 km2 in the coastal area was considered to be necessary to monitor hydraulic head variations as negative heads here could result in seawater intrusion jousma et al 2006 the main objectives of groundwater salinity monitoring are to delineate saline groundwater distribution to monitor saltwater migration and to detect trend of salinity increase the contour maps of tds distribution from the seawat model provided locations of saltwater distribution and seawater intrusion these contour maps were used to locate wells for salinity monitoring target monitoring wells were selected from fresh saltwater transition zones and saltwater intrusion zones representative wells were also selected in areas with different salinity levels tds values were read at locations of these fictitious wells from the seawat model cells 2 4 4 construction of contour maps with kriging interpolation method kriging is a spatial interpolation method that builds on the geostatistical principle of regionalized variables oliver 2010 the interpolated value is a weighted average of the measurements as 1 z 0 i 1 n λ 0 i z i where z 0 is the interpolated value at the location x 0 z i is the measurement at the location x i i 1 2 n n is the number of measurements λ0 i is the kriging weighting coefficients associated with the location x 0 the kriging weighting coefficients can be found from the kriging system equations 2a j 1 n λ 0 j γ x i x j μ γ x i x 0 i 1 n 2b i 1 n λ 0 i 1 where γ d is called the semi variogram or simply variogram d is the distance between two locations x i and x j the variance of the interpolation error is computed as 3 v a r z 0 z 0 i 1 n λ 0 i γ x i x 0 μ the variogram function is usually identified with the measurements for groundwater levels a linear function is usually defined as 4 γ d c 0 θ d where c 0 is the nugget effect and θ is the slope of the linear function sometimes exponential function may be used 5 γ d c 0 c 1 1 e d α where c 0 c 1 is the sill value which is the variogram value for very large distance α is the correlation length kriging interpolation error was often used as a criterion for monitoring network design zhou et al 2013 in this study ordinary kriging in surfer software bresnahan and dickenson 2002 was used to re construct contour maps of groundwater levels and salinity groundwater level and salinity values at fictitious monitoring wells were obtained from the models and used to fit variogram models and create contour maps of groundwater level and salinity and interpolation errors when monitoring wells were properly chosen constructed contour maps of groundwater levels and salinity should resemble the contour maps from modflow and seawat models furthermore standard deviation of interpolation error should be smaller than a threshold value the threshold values for groundwater level and tds were considered as 1 0 m and 500 mg l respectively the maximum root mean square error of the model calibration is 0 6 m van et al 2023 therefore a threshold value for the groundwater level is chosen as 1 0 m for tds the threshold value should be less than fresh saltwater interface 1000 mg l therefore a value of 500 mg l is chosen so that the interpolation accuracy is high enough to determine the interface 2 4 5 design procedures an iterative procedure was used to select a minimum number of monitoring wells starting with a small number of monitoring wells contour maps were compared and the interpolation error was checked new monitoring wells were added at locations where contour maps show large differences and the interpolation error is larger than threshold values when both criteria were satisfied designed monitoring wells were distributed among different levels of priority for stepwise implementation first initial monitoring wells were determined based on the hydrogeological conditions topography and abstractions groundwater levels and tds at the designed wells were read from the corresponding cell values of the groundwater flow and saltwater transport models second a variogram model was fitted with the designed well locations and computed groundwater levels and tds third contour maps of groundwater levels and tds and standard deviation of interpolation error were constructed with kriging interpolation method fourth the similarity of groundwater level and tds contour maps from kriging interpolation was compared with the contour map from the groundwater flow and saltwater transport models standard deviation of interpolation error was checked with the threshold value fifth new observation wells were added in areas where the contour maps of groundwater levels and tds from the kriging interpolation are different from models and or standard deviations are higher than the threshold values then steps 2 5 were repeated until a satisfactory monitoring network was designed 3 results and discussion 3 1 design of groundwater level monitoring network the holocene aquifer qh is unconfined interacts with rivers and receives recharge from precipitation infiltration a smaller cone of depression was formed in the northwest area due to intensive groundwater abstractions in underling aquifers fig 4a therefore it is important to monitor groundwater levels in this aquifer even though the aquifer is not intensively abstracted for water supply due to lower permeability and limited thickness with the above mentioned iterative procedure 30 observation wells were selected blue points in fig 4a including 3 existing wells groundwater levels at these fictitious wells were read from the model cell values the variogram analysis identified a linear variogram model with a slope of 0 0002 and no nugget effect see supplementary material the contour map from the kriging interpolation was shown in fig 4b which is similar as the contour map from the groundwater model in fig 4a furthermore contour map of the standard deviation of the interpolation error is smaller than 1 0 m in most important areas fig 7a it is higher than 1 0 m in some areas where a larger error is accepted where no groundwater abstraction takes place and nor important hydrogeological conditions present intensive groundwater abstraction takes place in the upper pleistocene aquifer qp3 contour map of groundwater levels from the model fig 5a shows a large cone of depression is formed at the west area the computed groundwater levels along the coast are slightly below the sea level so that seawater intrusion may occur 28 observation wells include one existing well were finally selected to monitor the cone of depression seawater intrusion and groundwater levels along the boundary a linear variogram model was fitted with a slope of 0 00012 and no nugget effect the contour map from the kriging interpolation was shown in fig 5b resembling the contour map from the groundwater model in fig 5a furthermore contour map of the standard deviation of the interpolation error is smaller than 1 5 m in all areas fig 7b the upper middle pleistocene aquifer qp2 3 is also intensively exploited for water supply contour map of groundwater levels also shows a large cone of depression with lower groundwater level in the west area a smaller cone of the depression occurs in the coastal area groundwater in this aquifer comes mainly from the leakage of the aquifers above 28 observation wells include two existing wells were finally selected to monitor the cone of depression seawater intrusion and groundwater levels along the boundary a linear variogram model was fitted with a slope of 0 00011 and no nugget effect the contour map from the kriging interpolation was shown in fig 6b resembling the contour map from the groundwater model in fig 6a contour map of the standard deviation of the interpolation error is smaller than 1 2 m in all areas fig 7c 3 2 design of groundwater salinity monitoring network the tds contour map interpolated from 412 ec measurements in the qp2 3 aquifer in 2017 is shown in fig 8a together with the model computed contour map fig 8b in the same period they show similar distributions the highest salinities in the northeast and the freshwater occurring in a large part of the area also near the coast this shows the predominant source of old saltwater in the aquifer trapped during marine transgressions and modern seawater intrusion occurs in the coast at the wedge shaped interface for the other aquifers the model and observed values also correspond quite well van et al 2023 the results of the seawat model also indicated that there is an increasing saline area in all aquifers except for the qh aquifer in the holocene aquifer qh saltwater is distributed in a large portion of the province area except for the fresh water lenses in sand dune areas the tds concentration of the qh aquifer fluctuates seasonally due to direct recharge from rainfall subsequently a preliminary groundwater salinity monitoring network was also designed for the tra vinh province focusing on top three aquifers we used the same iterative procedure as for the design of groundwater level monitoring network however monitoring wells were selected from existing pumping wells for salinity monitoring so no new monitoring wells are to be installed contour maps of tds computed by seawat model in march 2016 were used as basic maps to select potential monitoring wells for the top 3 aquifers fig 9a fig 10a and fig 11a through a number of trial and error iterations the final number of selected monitoring wells are 57 59 and 74 for the holocene aquifer qh upper pleistocene aquifer qp3 and upper middle pleistocene aquifer qp2 3 respectively table 2 linear variogram models were identified for qh qp3 and qp2 3 aquifers with a slope of 27 23 and 42 and no nugget effect respectively the constructed contour maps of groundwater tds with kriging interpolation from the selected monitoring wells fig 9b fig 10b and fig 11b using the fitted variogram models resemble the contour maps from the seawat model in the coastline two rows of wells parallel to the coastline were selected in order to monitor the seawater intrusion similarly at the inland fresh salt water interfaces two parallel wells were selected to monitor the migration of the interface due to groundwater abstraction the standard deviation of kriging interpolation error is smaller than 500 mg l threshold value in qh qp3 and qp2 3 aquifers fig 12 however the standard deviation of interpolation error is larger in the middle pleistocene qp2 3 aquifer since the variogram has a larger slope in conclusion these selected monitoring wells consist of a good preliminary groundwater salinity monitoring network for the tra vinh province 3 3 priority of implementation installation of groundwater monitoring wells is very expensive so a stepwise implementation approach is recommended monitoring wells were divided in two categories of priorities for implementing the groundwater level monitoring the first category includes 53 monitoring wells which are distributed at depression cones and along provincial boundaries table 2 there were 27 monitoring wells of the second category located in other areas of the three different aquifers in case of implementing the salinity monitoring network 110 monitoring wells were identified in the first category of priorities which focus on the fresh saline interface the coastline and the province boundaries the second category includes 80 monitoring wells distributed following the salinity distribution of the three aquifers table 2 pumping wells at the designed locations of monitoring wells can be selected for monitoring groundwater salinity with ec meters participatory monitoring by local stakeholders can be established for salinity monitoring farmers water supply companies youth and women unions are to be attracted to monitor groundwater salinity voluntarily 3 4 discussion groundwater in the coastal aquifers provide essential domestic water supply for tra vinh province limited groundwater recharge and existence of saltwater distribution and potential seawater intrusion are threatening sustainable development of groundwater resources current groundwater level and salinity monitoring is limited and insufficient to characterize the regional groundwater regime to delineate the cones of depression and the spatial distribution of saltwater the existent monitoring wells are also not able to representatively detect the trend of groundwater level decline and increase of salinity systematic monitoring networks for groundwater level and salinity are urgently required for the security of domestic water supply as a start preliminary monitoring networks with a minimum number of monitoring wells should be designed to initiate the monitoring process the networks can be further optimized later on when sufficient data are collected from the preliminary networks zhou et al 2013 since there is not enough information available for the design of preliminary monitoring networks in the tra vinh province groundwater models were constructed and used to provide contour maps of groundwater levels and salinity tds so that potential monitoring locations could be selected from the contour maps following hydrogeological considerations values of groundwater levels and tds can then be read from these contour maps at locations of selected monitoring wells the kriging interpolation method revealed capable of analyzing the monitoring network configurations and assessing the minimum number of wells necessary to re construct the contour maps they further allowed computing interpolation errors and using these in the assessment the similarity between these contour maps and interpolation error provided the criteria to select proper locations for the set up of preliminary monitoring networks this methodology has been applied in several other case studies chao et al 2011 nabi et al 2011 ohmer et al 2019 sheikhy narany et al 2014 yang et al 2008 the contour maps of groundwater levels from the modflow model clearly show that regional cones of depression are formed in the three aquifers groundwater levels are below sea level triggering flow of inland saltwater towards the wells and possible seawater intrusion near the coast alfarrah and walraevens 2018 badaruddin et al 2015 costall et al 2020 in addition groundwater recharge may be induced from surface waters da costa et al 2019 döll et al 2012 jinno et al 2009 therefore priorities for groundwater level monitoring should target these areas monitoring wells defined as first priority should be installed first measurements from these new monitoring wells can validate the model results and further help to calibrate the modflow model the computed groundwater levels from the improved model can then be used to adjust locations of monitoring wells in the second priority list iterations between the groundwater modeling and monitoring can lead to an optimal monitoring network and a reliable model as a tool for the planning and management of groundwater resources development chadalavada et al 2012 lal and datta 2019 sreekanth and datta 2014 zhou et al 2013 contour maps of groundwater salinity tds from the seawat model indicate limited seawater intrusion in the coastal area and the existence of saltwater in inland areas these saltwater areas have been confirmed from salinity monitoring campaigns at pumping wells in 2017 it is relatively easier to monitor groundwater salinity from a large number of monitoring wells pumping wells with the well screen located in a specific aquifer can be selected for measuring salinity with ec meters owners of wells are interested to measure ec values as volunteers within a framework of participatory monitoring systems awareness education and training of using ec meters should be provided to volunteers office 2011 prouteau and wolff 2008 a protocol of quality control system is also important additional ec measurements can be obtained from groundwater level monitoring wells when installed it is not necessary to measure ec values with a high frequency since groundwater salinity only shows gradual changes ec measurements of twice a year one in dry period december april and one in raining period may november are good practice to begin with intensive measurements of ec values can also help to improve saltwater transport model faneca sànchez et al 2015 guo et al 2019 shin and hwang 2020 and support the use of this tool for salinity control and mitigation abd elhamid et al 2020 altalmas 2012 huang and chiu 2018 hussain et al 2019 4 conclusions groundwater monitoring networks for tra vinh province were designed for monitoring of groundwater level and salinity for groundwater resources management and safety of drinking water supply in particular since only a few groundwater monitoring wells exist groundwater models were used to simulate groundwater level and salinity distributions based on contour maps of groundwater level and salinity constructed from models monitoring wells were selected following the criteria of network design in the coastal area using kriging method the groundwater level monitoring network designed for tra vinh province consists of 80 monitoring wells for three shallow aquifers thirteen wells are located along the coastline and boundaries of the province to identify cross boundary flow eleven monitoring wells are distributed in the regional cones of depression twenty seven monitoring wells are scattered evenly in the aquifers in order to construct contour maps of groundwater levels with similar accuracy the standard deviation of the interpolation error from the designed monitoring network varies from 0 2 to 1 4 m tds contour maps were constructed with the saltwater transport model and provided the distribution of fresh and saline groundwater in tra vinh province revealing that saltwater is mostly present in the northeastern area in the main aquifers a denser network of salinity monitoring was designed with 190 wells for three shallow aquifers a large number of salinity monitoring wells are located along the coastline and inland fresh salt water interfaces a considerable amount of monitoring wells was designed along main tds contour lines of 1500 mg l and 500 mg l for assessing the risk of salinization of drinking water wells the standard deviation of interpolation error is less than 500 mg l in all 3 aquifers professional monitoring wells for groundwater level monitoring are preferred since water levels in pumping wells are not representative for water levels in the aquifer however pumping wells provide easy access for salinity monitoring when well screens are located in a specific aquifer owners of the wells can be recruited as volunteer observers for salinity monitoring equipped with an ec meter the designed monitoring wells can be installed in a stepwise manner following the priority lists groundwater level monitoring wells in the areas of significant groundwater drawdown should be given high priority for controlling aquifer depletion

7689,study region the baltic countries estonia latvia lithuania north eastern europe study focus time series models are a convenient tool for modeling hydraulic head time series due to their parsimonious parameterization and quick calculation time however it is unclear how the model structure and the outcome relate to the respective site characteristics time series modeling with impulse response functions was used to model the head time series the correlations between the model performance and the environmental settings and between the model parameters and the environmental settings were analyzed using spearman rank correlation and random forest regression analyses new hydrological insights from the 460 analyzed head time series 145 were modeled with satisfactory goodness of fit in the calibration period using only precipitation potential evaporation and temperature as model inputs this number decreased to 68 time series with a satisfactory fit in the validation period including additional drivers in wells where a substantial influence is characteristic could improve modeling results the model results suggest that snow processes are affecting head dynamics in many wells in the baltic countries most correlations between the model performance and the environmental setting were observed with the geological and climatic setting of the site models performed best in monitoring wells with shallow groundwater and lower precipitation seasonality graphical abstract keywords time series models irf hydraulic head shap values environmental variables data availability

supply to ecosystems kløve et al 2011 and for human consumption kitterød et al 2022 replenishment recharge and depletion discharge abstraction of the groundwater resources have a strong seasonal character driven by changing weather patterns as a result strong seasonal and intra seasonal fluctuations of groundwater hydraulic heads hereafter heads are observed worldwide jasechko et al 2014 head dynamics are affected by various environmental factors including climate land use and cover vegetation geological setting and artificial abstraction many environmental processes are controlled by local fluctuations of heads which are as diverse as greenhouse gas emissions from soils evans et al 2021 mander et al 2022 leaching and attenuation of fertilizers and pesticides from farmlands baran et al 2021 marsala et al 2020 or river base flow hendriks et al 2014 to gain valuable insights into the aforementioned processes a robust and simple method to model heads would be beneficial the models used to simulate heads vary in their level of complexity both in spatial and temporal discretization and the level of represented physical processes relatively simple one dimensional lumped parameter models use time series of input drivers and calibration targets without considering the physical characteristics of the studied location devia et al 2015 since only a point in space is modeled e g head fluctuations in monitoring well in the study of mackay et al 2014 spatial conclusions drawn from individual instances of such models may not be valid although this is a substantial drawback of the modeling approach as compared to distributed process based models lumped parameter models require a lower amount of input data a shorter calibration time and a lower effort for model development while generally good model fits are obtained bakker and schaars 2019 time series models using impulse response functions irf as proposed by von asmuth et al 2002 are lumped parameter models that translate precipitation and other drivers into the output the head it has been shown that the use of such models is a simple and effective method for predicting head fluctuations e g marchant and bloomfield 2018 the impulse response function characterizes head response to an impulse of a driver such as a precipitation event von asmuth et al 2001 the function can take various shapes and thus is capable of describing a broad range of possible relationships between the impulse precipitation or another driver and the response the head bakker et al 2008 2007 von asmuth et al 2002 being a lumped parameter model a model instance is created for each head time series individually collenteur et al 2019 time series models with impulse response functions have been applied to a variety of problems ranging from gap filling of time series peterson and western 2018 hindcasting babre et al 2022 to recharge estimation collenteur et al 2021 hocking and kelly 2016 another common application is to quantify the effects of different drivers on the heads brakenhoff et al 2022 shapoori et al 2015b van dijk et al 2020 these models can be calibrated to head time series with irregular measurements bierkens et al 1999 as is the case for most historical groundwater level observations retike et al 2022 careful consideration should be given to selecting an appropriate model structure a good resulting fit of time series models indicates that the head fluctuations can be explained well by the explanatory series a low fit on the other hand can be caused by missing or non representative input drivers or model structural errors among other reasons zaadnoordijk et al 2019 a linear precipitation excess model calculates recharge as the difference between precipitation and evaporation a nonlinear recharge model on the other hand also considers moisture retention in the soil and the limitation of actual evaporation by soil moisture availability this can improve the simulation of the heads peterson and western 2014 collenteur et al 2021 recently collenteur 2022 extended a nonlinear recharge model with a degree day snow model e g kavetski and kuczera 2007 to improve the model fit at sites where snowfall occurs regularly the relationships between the site characteristics e g depth to water table and the model fit or model parameters respectively are currently not well understood irf based models have mainly been used as a tool in studies that characterize links between the environment and groundwater variability e g hocking and kelly 2016 lu et al 2021 van dijk et al 2020 or that describe similarities between some environmental factors and the groundwater e g manzione et al 2017 long and mahler 2013 the links between model performance and the study site characteristics have not been extensively described beyond the influence of individual factors e g the thickness of unsaturated zone zaadnoordijk et al 2019 and aquifer properties obergfell et al 2013 shapoori et al 2015a to the best knowledge of the authors correlations between the irf parameters and the environmental variables were only systematically explored in a study of switzerland with a limited number of wells collenteur 2022 the study showed that such relations may exist but also concluded that additional research with more data is required the aim of this study is to systematically analyze and better understand the relationships between 1 the environmental variables and the model fit and 2 the environmental variables and the model parameter values to achieve these aims the following steps were taken in the first step head time series from the baltic countries were modeled using four different model structures with increasing complexity in the second step the differences in goodness of fit between the model structures were compared using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse in the third step the correlation between the model fit nse and the environmental variables was explored with the spearman rank correlation analysis in the fourth step random forest rf regression models were built with environmental variables as predictors and nse values as the prediction target to gain additional insights into the variables that may explain where a model structure works well and where not to explore the correlations between the environmental variables and the parameters determining the shape of irf steps 3 to 5 were repeated using the parameters describing the irf separately 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the baltic states estonia latvia and lithuania are located in the northeast of europe and span 175 117 km 2 kriauciuniene et al 2012 they belong to the snow climate fully humid with warm summers d f b köppen geiger climate classification type beck et al 2018 kottek et al 2006 locally the climate varies between maritime and continental climates in the west east direction with additional variations in the north south direction and based on orography where a lower temperature and higher precipitation are characteristic in the highlands bethere et al 2017 the mean annual precipitation ranges between 600 mm and over 800 mm per year jaagus et al 2010 the highest elevation point is just over 300 m a s l and s sw winds prevail pogumirskis et al 2021 2 2 hydrogeological setting the study area is located in the baltic artesian basin and the three baltic countries cover most of its terrestrial part the baltic artesian basin is a multi layered sedimentary basin with vast amounts of groundwater kitterød et al 2022 it consists of many aquifers forming three principal zones according to water exchange intensity stagnant passive and active water exchange zones the latter of which is predominantly used for water supply lukševičs et al 2012 aquifers typically consist of weakly cemented terrigenous and carbonate rocks and evaporites are less common the principal zones are separated from each other by regional aquitards which are formed mostly of marls and clays kitterød et al 2022 the active water exchange zone is formed by cambrian vendian northern estonia silurian ordovician central and western estonia upper middle devonian southern estonia latvia lithuania and cenozoic mesozoic lithuania aquifer systems kitterød et al 2022 quaternary deposits glacial glaciolacustrine glaciofluvial and marine sediments are very heterogeneous and form the upper part of the active water exchange zone over bedrock aquifers with a thickness of a few meters in the northwestern part of the territory and the lowlands up to 200 meters in the uplands and more than 300 meters in the buried valleys popovs et al 2015 2022 although less so than the deeper bedrock aquifers quaternary groundwater is also used for centralized and decentralized water supply and is a major source of water for groundwater dependent ecosystems kalvāns et al 2021 terasmaa et al 2020 2 3 data collection and preparation 2 3 1 hydraulic head data the head data were obtained from various organizations responsible for maintaining head monitoring networks in the baltic states the republic of estonia environment agency the latvian environment geology and meteorology center and the lithuanian geological survey the data set consists of 1671 time series of heads and the metadata measured in each of them the metadata includes information on the respective station if applicable coordinates the elevation of the monitoring well the respective aquifer well screen and depth to groundwater information varying start and end dates and data gaps with different lengths are present in the data the monitoring frequency of heads varied from a few measurements per year to twice a day measurements the automatic data logging two measurements per day started after 2004 in lithuania and after 2009 in estonia and latvia the raw head measurements were pre processed using the four eye principle and expert judgment following the methodology outlined in retike et al 2022 we deleted visible outliers and corrected shifts and systematic errors i e errors caused by automatic logger problems short term abstraction impacts human introduced and other miscellaneous errors the time series used for the analysis were selected based on two criteria first the required length of the time series was set to 15 years with no more than 12 data gaps where a data gap corresponded to a month where there were no observations if the length of the time series was longer the most recent 15 years of data were selected it ensures that the time series contain more observations since generally the measuring frequency was higher in the most recent years the data for periods where two measurements per day were taken was averaged to daily data as part of the pre processing step the second criterion was that the time series do not have a substantial trend during the calibration period chosen as the first ten years of the 15 year time series the trend analysis was performed by calculating sen s slopes sen 1968 before the calculation time series were aggregated by the mean over 3 month time steps such a value was chosen because a regular time step between measurements was necessary to perform the trend analysis additionally this aggregation step was chosen to balance between decreasing the noise that might impact the calculated trend and maintaining enough entries in the time series for the test given the varying frequencies in the head data the head values were re scaled in the range 0 1 by subtracting the mean and dividing over the range of the values we argue that small trends in the head data may be explained by trends in the explanatory time series selecting only time series with a slope of zero would exclude head time series that may still be explained well with the input data used in this study therefore the choice for the threshold value was made semi quantitatively its value was determined as the elbow point in the histogram of all slope values bins 20 the elbow point is the inflection point where the curvature changes and it was determined visually an additional visual evaluation was subsequently performed on a subset of the series below the determined threshold to ensure that it corresponds to series that are approximately stationary time series with a median slope of less than or equal to 0 07 in absolute values per 3 months were selected for further modeling the resulting data set after the different pre processing steps is as follows of the original data set with 1671 time series 735 time series cover a minimum 15 year period of these 735 time series 460 had a slope smaller or equivalent to the chosen slope threshold 0 07 over 3 months for the re scaled head series in the calibration period these 460 time series are used for further analysis in the remainder of this paper the locations of the selected monitoring wells are shown in fig 1 2 3 2 meteorological data the daily precipitation sum and the mean maximum and minimum temperature data were obtained from the european climate assessment dataset e obs gridded data ensemble v 25 0e resolution 0 1 cornes et al 2018 the potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated using the hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 from the temperature data the time series of all of these drivers are available from the year 1953 to 2021 2 3 3 environmental variables to determine the correlations between the environmental setting of the monitoring well the model fit and the parameters of the impulse response functions a set of environmental variables were derived from climatic topographic geologic and boundary data following haaf et al 2020 this data set was further extended with land cover variables in total 11 climatic 15 geological 7 boundary 5 land cover and 8 topographic variables were computed summarized in table 1 the histograms of the environmental variables can be seen in fig s2 of the supplement the geological variables were prepared using the lithology and geological cross section data from popovs et al 2015 and virbulis et al 2013 the lithology data contained 12 unique classes the dataset contained information on the geological indices and the depth of both the top and the bottom of the geological layers present in each of the cross sections the boundary variables were calculated using a digital elevation model dem with a 10 m resolution compiled from respective 10 m dems from the republic of estonia land board republic of estonia land board 2022 the latvian geospatial information agency latvian geospatial information agency 2022 the lithuanian geological survey provided upon request and water body data from open street map geofabrik gmbh and contributors of open street map 2018 the topography parameters were calculated for 500 m buffers around the monitoring wells using the compiled dem the climatic variables were calculated using daily mean temperature and daily precipitation from the e obs data for the respective 10 year period of calibration using the closest cell center values for each monitoring well the land cover variables were extracted over a 500 m buffer around the monitoring well from the copernicus corine land cover clc data european environment agency 2018 version 2018 to the first level e g group 1 artificial surfaces and the area within the buffer was summarized 2 4 methods 2 4 1 time series modeling using impulse response functions time series models using impulse response functions irf are used to model the head time series von asmuth et al 2002 predefined response functions are used to characterize the head response to a unit pulse of a driver e g precipitation in this study daily precipitation potential evaporation and mean temperature data are used as drivers the head at each time step is modeled as a superposition of the lagged driver impacts the value of the driver of each lagged time step is multiplied by the impulse response value of the respective time step and subsequently summed the shape and size of the response function are described by only a few parameters which are estimated by fitting the simulated head time series to the observed the choice for a certain irf type depends on its capability to characterize the head response accurately a scaled gamma distribution function is often used to simulate the head response to different drivers e g von asmuth et al 2008 the impulse response function is written as 1 θ p t a t n 1 a n γ n e t a for t 0 where a a and n are parameters that describe the shape of the response function alternatively a four parameter function may be used bakker et al 2008 for which the impulse response function is approximated as follows 2 θ p t a t n 1 e t a a b t for t 0 where a n a b are the shape parameters of the response function for both response functions the parameter a corresponds to the gain of the system the magnitude of the impact and the parameters n and a determine the shape i e larger values of n and a simulate a more lagged response to an impulse of a driver the parameter b of the four parameter function eq 2 allows for a larger delay in the response by shifting the response in time the parameter values of the different impulse response functions are unknown and need to be inferred from the data two approaches are applied to account for precipitation and potential evaporation in the model a linear precipitation excess model and a nonlinear root zone model these models are only briefly introduced here and we refer to collenteur et al 2021 and references therein for a more detailed explanation the linear model assumes a linear relationship between precipitation and evaporation the nonlinear model on the other hand accounts for the nonlinear response of the head to precipitation and evaporation this nonlinear model assumes that the system can be modeled as two connecting reservoirs an interception and root zone reservoirs thus including short term water retention in the soil in the calculations under certain conditions a linear model combined with a more complex impulse response function can produce results similar to those of the root zone model however as also stated by peterson and western 2018 the missing soil moisture representation may introduce possible errors if snow processes e g snowfall and snowmelt are of importance a snow reservoir may be added on top of the nonlinear model collenteur 2022 in general it can be assumed that the model that is most appropriate for each individual monitoring well is unknown a multi model approach is therefore applied here assessing the performance of four different model structures with increasing complexity to simulate the heads these include linear and nonlinear approaches to take precipitation and evaporation into account combined with a gamma or four parameter function to describe the shape of the response the models used in the study were from the simplest to the most complex a linear model with gamma function lg a linear model with a four parameter function l4 a nonlinear model with a gamma function nlg and a nonlinear snow model with a gamma function nls see table 2 different hydrological processes are represented in these models and the models have an increasing amount of parameters that need to be estimated 2 4 2 model calibration and evaluation the models were calibrated by fitting the simulated heads to the observed ones the residuals of models simulating head time series often show strong autocorrelation and are therefore first modeled with an auto regressive noise model of order one ar1 the resulting noise time series which should have reduced autocorrelation compared to the raw model residuals is then minimized using a nonlinear least squares approach the parameters were estimated first without the noise model and subsequently with a noise model to ensure better parameter calibration for a thorough explanation of this calibration process readers are referred to von asmuth and bierkens 2005 and collenteur et al 2021 the models were calibrated over a 10 years period it should be noted that the start and end dates of calibration for each monitoring well change depending on the available head data for that well a warmup period of 10 years was applied and the modeling time step was 1 day the performance of the ar1 noise model was evaluated with the non parametric stoffer toloi test to determine whether the autocorrelation is significantly different from zero on non equidistant time series a significance level of 0 05 was used the model fit was determined by a combination of an evaluation metric and visual evaluation as suggested by bennett et al 2013 legates and mccabe 1999 moriasi et al 2007 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the root mean squared error rmse were calculated nse is the ratio between the variance of the residuals and the variance of the observations with resulting values in the range 1 a value above zero indicates that the simulation gives a better result than using the mean of the values gupta and kling 2011 knoben et al 2019 the rmse values span 0 moriasi et al 2015 and are in the units of measure legates and mccabe 1999 both metrics were calculated for the calibration and validation periods separately models reaching the threshold of 0 65 for nse and passing visual evaluation does the simulation follow the trend of the observations in the calibration period were determined as having a good fit the rmse values were used to additionally assess the model fit but not used as a threshold because the amplitudes of the head series were different mann whitney u test e g nachar 2008 was performed on the obtained nse values over the calibration period of the different model structures to determine if the resulting difference is statistically significant 2 4 3 assessing correlations between model performance model parameterization and the environmental variables to investigate if changes in the model performance and calibrated parameter values correspond to those of the independent environmental variables correlation and regression analyses were performed the aim of these analyses is twofold 1 to determine which model structures work best in which environmental settings as quantified by the environmental variables and 2 to investigate how the parameters of the response function are related to the environmental settings for the first purpose the nse value of a model during the calibration period is used here to quantify the model performance for the analysis between the model performance and the environmental variables the nse values during the calibration period of all models irrespective of the model fit were used for the analysis concerning the parameters a n and a of the irf however the analysis was performed on the parameter values of the models that reached a good fit for all model structures using only the time series where all model structures passed the threshold ensures that the models could reasonably quantify the head fluctuations with the calibrated parameters for both analyses an equal subset of the time series was used for all four model structures thus the observed strength of relations could be compared between model structures to determine if the nse or parameter values are related to the value of environmental variables a non parametric spearman rank correlation analysis was performed this was done for each environmental variable and the nse or irf parameter values for each model structure separately both the correlation coefficients and their statistical significance were calculated the significance level used to determine if the correlations are significant was set to 0 05 subsequently a random forest regression was applied together with a shapely additive explanations shap values analysis and plotting partial dependence random forest is a widely used non parametric machine learning approach for regression problems the prediction is obtained by creating decision trees from randomly selected inputs and averaging their outcome the advantages of this regression approach include robustness to overfitting breiman 2001 and its explainability the concept of shap values has recently been demonstrated to be useful to quantify the impact of each explanatory variable on the prediction in machine learning models e g stream nutrients in virro et al 2022 or groundwater levels in wunsch et al 2022 the shap values can be calculated both globally dataset wide and locally individual instances and reveal the direction of the association a positive or negative contribution lipovetsky and conklin 2001 the values are in the units of the prediction target and therefore simple to interpret molnar 2022 for random forest models the purpose adjusted treeexplainer was used to calculate the shap values lundberg et al 2020 the shap value analysis is often combined with partial dependence plots the plots visualize the contribution of an explanatory variable on the prediction target after the average impacts of other variables have been removed the marginal effect friedman and meulman 2003 the plots reveal if the association is linear non linear or monotonic molnar 2022 for further details the readers are referred to friedman 2001 the nse and the irf parameters of each of the model structures lg l4 nlg and nls were analyzed separately using the respective environmental variables as the independent variables and the nse or parameter values as the prediction target since the rf model does not accept empty input values the monitoring wells with at least one missing environmental variable value were eliminated before the regression analysis the default random forest parameters n estimators 100 max depth none min samples split 2 were used both the average and individual shap values were calculated the partial dependence was plotted for 10 variables with the highest influence 3 results 3 1 overall model performances each of the 460 time series selected for the analysis was modeled with the four different model structures in total 1840 models were created of the 1840 models 334 models corresponding to 145 out of 460 unique monitoring wells had a good fit in the calibration period i e they reached or exceeded the chosen metric threshold the nls model structure performed the best having the highest number of models with a good fit 34 of the models respectively table 3 the nlg model structure scored the lowest with 20 of models with a good fit of the 334 models 131 reached the metric threshold in the validation period 68 unique monitoring wells the highest count of models with a good fit was again for the nls model 31 with the lg l4 and nlg model structures all achieving lower numbers a visual evaluation was performed on the hydrographs of the models that exceeded the goodness of fit thresholds in the validation period no models were discarded showing that the goodness of fit metric and its threshold sufficed as an evaluation in this study fig 2 shows boxplots of the goodness of fit metrics for all four model structures for both the calibration upper row and the validation period lower row the median nse of the calibration period varied between 0 45 and 0 52 for the four model structures this indicates that the models have a notable difference in modeling performance the nls model structure had the highest average nse value and the nlg model structure scored the lowest the mann whitney u test revealed that the difference in performance between both model structures is statistically significant for any other combination of the model structures there was no significant difference the rmse values are in the same units as the studied variable in this study in meters all of the model structures had similar rmse values in the calibration period with a difference of 1 cm between medians and they varied between 21 and 22 cm the median amplitude the maximum diversion from the mean of the time series was 90 cm therefore the obtained rmse compared against the median amplitude of the time series indicates that the heads were generally simulated well in the validation period all median metrics were worse than those in the calibration period this indicates that less of the groundwater level variability in that period was captured compared to the calibration period the l4 model structure had the highest nse median value and the nlg model structure scored the lowest however none of the differences between model structures were statistically significant like in the calibration period all model structures had very similar median rmse values 0 27 and 0 28 and they had increased by 6cm as compared to the calibration period many of the models showed particularly low performance during the validation period i e nse below zero a visual inspection of the results showed that these low fits in the validation period were caused by strong trends in the head data during that period which was not checked for the presence of trends we illustrate the results of model performance based on the structure with an example of well 2010 in estonia see fig 3 the nls model structure performed best in replicating the extremes especially in the colder months of the year from the remaining three model structures the nlg performed the best at replicating both peaks and lows while both linear models performed the poorest the obtained nse values for model structures are similarly ordered the nls model structure had nse over 0 7 for both calibration and validation periods followed by the nlg and l4 nse between 0 4 0 5 the lg performed the poorest with nse values of 0 25 and 0 3 in the calibration and validation periods respectively a stoffer toloi test was performed to evaluate the autocorrelation in the noise series across the model structures no significant autocorrelation was detected for approximately 33 to 42 of the models depending on the model structure the nls model resulted in the largest number of models without significant autocorrelation 196 models out of 460 models followed by the nlg 169 models the poorest results were obtained with both linear model structures 154 models for l4 and 158 for lg 3 2 correlation between environmental variables and model fit since the same monitoring well data was used for all model types 460 unique monitoring wells the correlation coefficients can be directly compared between the model structures overall low correlation coefficients were obtained see fig 4 the model fit described with the nse value most strongly correlated with various climatic variables both those that describe the average yearly meteorological conditions t avg pe avg and the seasonality effects si meanpwettest meanpdriest ai notably all model structures fits had negligible correlations with the average yearly precipitation p avg not displayed it indicates that the changes in model fit correspond with the respective precipitation seasonality more specifically a higher model fit is associated with lower precipitation seasonality for all model fits lower seasonality index more precipitation in the driest season and less precipitation in the wettest season additionally the model fit of nls had negligible correlations with those climatic variables that depend on temperature such as t avg pe avg and ai the model fit of nls correlated less with the precipitation seasonality variables it indicates that the nls model structure is the most robust model structure considering the seasonality setting of the monitoring wells the fit of both linear models was inversely correlated to the placement of the groundwater table described with the variables depth to gw and screen upp as well as the aquifer thickness a thickness namely more shallow groundwater level and thinner aquifer in study site corresponded to a higher model fit a similar conclusion could apply to the nlg model structure although a significant correlation was present only with one of the variables various lithology variable correlations with the model fit indicate that the model fit positively correlates with increasing thickness of highly permeable sediments gravel m and negatively with increasing thickness of less permeable sediments such as clay silt m however the lack of statistical significance and negligible correlation coefficients of other lithology groups indicates that within this study there is not enough evidence to reliably claim it in addition to the correlation analysis a regression analysis was performed based on the interpretable random forest rf algorithm on the data from 336 unique monitoring wells the 336 monitoring wells out of 460 selected for groundwater modeling correspond to those that remained after eliminating monitoring wells with missing environmental variables the obtained model fits r 2 varied between 0 85 0 89 indicating that the nse for all model structures could be predicted well from the selected environmental variables these variables were not used as input in modeling the groundwater level with the time series models therefore the relationships obtained with rf are an indirect interpretation that nevertheless can reveal valuable insights the shap values were used to analyze which environmental factors primarily explain the variation in nse among the different models the summary shap plot for all model structures is visualized in fig 5 displayed in the order of average importance descending the most important characteristics for prediction of model fit across all model structures were the geological depth to gw screep upp and climatic si meanpwettest and t avg setting of the monitoring wells while the absolute shap values describe the general impact of the variable on the nse values the summary plot allows exploring the direction of the impact for all model structures both larger values of depth to gw and screen upp contribute negatively to the model fit indicating that a higher fit is achieved for wells where the groundwater was more shallow similarly higher values of the climatic variables si seasonality index for both linear models and meanpwettest for both nonlinear models decreased the model fit indicating that for monitoring wells with more pronounced precipitation seasonality a lower fit of the models might be achieved however the climatic variable t avg present for all but nls structure contributed positively to the model fit while on average each variable had a minor influence on the nse value 0 05 the influence was substantial in individual locations for example a deeper upper level of the screen high values of variable screen upp decreased the model fit value by more than 0 5 for the lg model structure or up to 0 3 for the nlg model structure similarly deeper groundwater level higher values of the variable depth to gw contributed to decreasing the model fit by up to 0 2 or 0 3 depending on both the model structure and specific instance other variables with substantial local influence were the seasonality index for l4 and the topographic wetness index for the nls model structure across the four model structures a larger contribution was evident towards decreasing the nse value the highest positive influence on the model fit however was by the depth of groundwater level and the mean yearly temperature for the l4 model structure the nse value was increased by only up to 0 1 selected partial dependence plots are shown in fig 6 partial dependence plots provide insights into the impact of the value of the studied variable e g depth to the water table on the resulting model fit hence thresholds of impact can be determined by reading the horizontal axis where the variable values are displayed the influence of the variable t avg for the nlg model structure increases substantially from the 5 5 c mark the influence of the variable depth to gw is highest until the 2 m mark after which it drops and evens out in the case of the variable meanpwettest for the nls model structure partial dependence increased until around the 75 mm mark and subsequently decreased see the supplementary material figs 3 to 6 for partial dependence plots of the top 10 variables of all model structures 3 3 correlation between the environmental variables and the parameterization of irf the correlation analysis was performed for the parameters a n and a that describe the shape and size of the irf weak to medium correlation coefficients were obtained the resulting correlations for all model structures and the three parameters are shown in figs 7 8 and 9 the parameter a that characterizes the gain of the system significantly correlates with various lithology variables fig 7 with gravel m the correlation coefficient was negative more gravel means smaller gains while it was positive with the variable silt loam m which are less permeable sediments similarly negative correlations were present with the variables limestone m and marl m this indicates that the parameter a value is larger in locations with thicker low permeability sediments and smaller where more of less permeable sediments are present thus positively correlating with low permeability additionally the gain parameter was larger where the groundwater table was deeper positive correlation with depth to gw but the respective aquifer was thinner negative a thickness the parameter a was present in monitoring wells higher in the topography revealed by the value of a was larger when hgthps were higher and cnvr and cncv were lower mostly the significant correlations were shared between the model types e g pe avg for both nonlinear model structures or were individual the reason could be that the dataset could be too small to make reliable statistical claims or there indeed are differences between the correlations based on model types the shared correlation with limestone m indicates that different model types linear or nonlinear can correlate differently to some characteristics of the environmental setting the parameter n determines the time lag in the head response to the recharge or precipitation excess signals the positive correlations with variables depth to gw and screen upp fig 8 indicate that the value of n is larger in instances of a thicker unsaturated zone additionally the parameter value is higher where a thicker silt layer in the profile larger values of variable silt loam m is present similar to the parameter a a higher parameter n value is characteristic higher in the topography based on both hgthps and arbel variables and in locations with more pronounced rainfall seasonality variables si and meanpwettest the parameter a of the irf similar to the parameter n correlated to the depth of water table variables depth to gw and screen upp in addition the parameter of both linear model structures lg and l4 positively correlated with the absolute and relative elevation of the observation well hgthps and height ow while within this dataset positive correlations were obtained for both nonlinear models also there is not enough statistical evidence to claim that the correlations are significant similarly a negative correlation with marl m and a positive one with gravel m could mean that the parameter a correlates to the permeability of sediments however there is not enough statistical evidence 4 discussion 4 1 modeling hydraulic heads in the baltics application of the time series models on the 460 head time series selected for the analysis resulted in 145 monitoring wells where at least one model structure had a good fit with the head data this result shows that for about a third of the monitoring wells 30 it is possible to simulate the heads with reasonable accuracy using relatively simple models and only a few driving forces as such these monitoring wells appear to observe mostly natural fluctuations with relatively little impact from anthropogenic influences these results are in line with those from zaadnoordijk et al 2019 who found in a large scale study in the netherlands that less than half of the wells could be modeled satisfactorily with only precipitation and evaporation as driving forces for the remaining 70 of the monitoring wells in this study the results can be interpreted as an indication that other drivers may influence the heads e g pumping surface water levels the importance of other driving forces should not be unexpected as monitoring networks are often established with the purpose of monitoring human influences or changes on the groundwater as also suggested by zaadnoordijk et al 2019 including these additional drivers such as surface water fluctuations and pumping in the models could improve the results adding additional drivers to improve the modeling results is relatively easy for the type of model used in this study as shown in von asmuth et al 2008 for example based on the results of this study we recommend testing the use of additional input data to model the heads such as groundwater pumping and river stage data if such data is available only 131 models reached the goodness of fit thresholds in the validation period one reason for the decline in the model performance in the validation period is the presence of trends revealed from a visual inspection that could not be explained by the driving forces that were used checking for trends over both the calibration and validation period rather than only the calibration period as was done now could have prevented this this would however lead to a higher number of wells rejected from the analysis and not to more models with a good fit to increase the model fit including a linear trend in the model would be an option to try and improve the model fit without information on the cause of such trends this would however not lead to a better system understanding and was therefore judged outside the scope of this study the most appropriate model structure to simulate the heads will depend on the environmental settings of the monitoring well some general patterns however became apparent from the modeling results the nonlinear snow model with a gamma response function resulted in the highest number of models with a good fit high median metrics were also obtained for the linear model with a four parameter response function thus both model structures appear to be more applicable than the other models for a large number of wells in the baltics the improvement associated with the nls model structure over the other models can mostly be attributed to the inclusion of snow processes in this model as none of the other models included this process the linear four parameter function model can represent the delayed head response due to snow processes by shifting the response in time based on these results we conclude that when modeling the heads in the baltic countries it is important to account for the presence of snow cover when the temperatures are below zero this is in line with the general perception of the importance of these processes on the hydrological regime in the baltics e g kriauciuniene et al 2012 jaagus et al 2017 it is expected that these models will also perform better in other snow dominated regions around the world 4 2 the correlation between the environmental variables and the model fit or the model parameterization the obtained coefficients in correlation studies were weak to moderate however they give an insight into similarities between the placement of the monitoring well and the modeling outcome from the five groups of environmental variables the strongest correlations with the model fit were found with geological and climatic variable groups more specifically the thickness of the unsaturated zone or the upper level of the well screen variables depth to gw and screen upp respectively were found to be two of the most important variables in both the correlation and regression analyses negatively impacting the model fit e g lower fits for deeper water tables aquifers we only speculate about possible reasons that may explain this finding here shallow groundwater generally responds more quickly to the precipitation signal but as the thickness increases the head response becomes lagged at a certain depth it is entirely independent of the signal wang et al 2022 this may decrease our ability to determine the association other possible reasons include inappropriate model structures and unknown drivers such as pumping that disproportionately affect deeper aquifers e g pumping for safe drinking water from the climatic variables the mean precipitation of the wettest quarter meanpwettest correlated with the nse of all model structures it characterizes the summed precipitation of the wettest season june july and august which in this study was also the warmest season in addition the mean precipitation of the driest quarter meanpdriest february march and april and the seasonality index si correlated with all model structures nse values and scored high in the top 10 variables in the regression analysis the monitoring wells in the baltics correspond to two classes of si values monitoring wells without precipitation seasonality si 0 19 and monitoring wells with a more pronounced wet season si 0 2 0 39 walsh and lawler 1981 the driest season corresponds to months with both snow cover february sometimes march and spring floods april the months when the infiltration is highly affected by the mean temperature the lowest correlations were present with the nse of the nls model structure where the mean daily temperature was used as model input this is an additional indication that the inclusion of snow processes improves the model fit for the baltic states the correlations of the climatic variables indicate that the model fit is affected by the precipitation seasonality the model fit was higher for the monitoring wells where the precipitation seasonality was less pronounced while similarities between model structure correlations were evident the coefficient values varied the nls model structure appeared to be more robust towards the climatic impact since there were fewer statistically significant correlations with the variables of the group there were instances where both linear models shared a significant correlation while both nonlinear models did not and vice versa it could indicate that changing the model type to nonlinear brings more substantial changes than increasing the complexity of the irf function it is necessary however to point out that correlation coefficients without statistical significance mean that there is not enough statistical evidence to claim that the correlation is significant but we cannot claim that there is no correlation we cannot accept the null hypothesis just fail to reject it amrhein et al 2019 therefore the results should not be taken at face value and should be evaluated in the context they represent further larger scale studies would be advisable thus our conclusions are affected by our chosen dataset the correlation analysis performed on the models with a good fit in the validation period not shown revealed that the significant correlation coefficients were moderate 0 3 0 5 as opposed to weak when the analysis was performed on all models the number of significant correlations decreased however most probably due to the decreased dataset the variables correlating with model fit were from the climatic group for the lg l4 and nlg model structures variables si ai meanpdriest and t avg and topographic and boundary arbel and height to stream for the nls model structure we stress that within this study the environmental variables were not used in the irf models as an input the rf models were built using the independent environmental variables as the predictors and the model fit obtained from the irf models as the prediction target thus links between the environmental setting and the model fit can be explored for models that need parsimonious input the obtained results of the shap value analysis reveal that depth to groundwater level seasonality index the upper level of the well screen and other variables can have substantial impacts on the resulting model fit up to 0 5 in absolute values depending on the selected model structure and environmental settings of the monitoring well the obtained partial dependence plots reveal that beyond the depth of 2 m the depth of groundwater has a close to uniform low impact on the modeling outcome similarly the yearly average temperature has the highest impact on the modeling outcome when the temperature is higher than 5 5 degrees and the mean precipitation in the wettest quarter is lower than 73 mm we note here that both methods assume independence of the features molnar 2022 which could have affected the obtained results conclusions drawn from shap values and partial dependence plots however could aid in pre screening wells where modeling could be applicable for the parameters of the irf moderate correlations with the independent topographic variables were observed besides both the geological and climatic variables among these variables describing the topographic location were present for the gain parameter a such as the variable hgthps the position of the well relative to the height range a higher parameter a and a value was observed in the monitoring wells higher in the topography and with thicker vadose zones similarly higher values of the parameter n which describes the time delay of the head response to a driver impulse were observed in monitoring wells higher in the catchment variable arbel some of the variables however can represent other processes and hence may be proxy values for different impacts for example the mean yearly temperature t avg can also represent the orography since lower temperatures on average are characteristic in the highlands bethere et al 2017 4 3 limitations and possibilities to investigate the correlations between the model parameters and the environmental variables only good models were selected the criterion of model selection could be improved in this study a good fit corresponded to exceeding a metric threshold here good is defined as passing a threshold of 0 65 for the nse which was arbitrarily set and a modelers choice if this threshold would be set to 0 5 already 818 and 380 models would have a good fit in the calibration and validation period respectively as opposed to 334 and 131 models respectively with the threshold of 0 65 different selection criteria have been used in other studies such as performing autocorrelation tests and determining the plausibility of the parameters e g brakenhoff et al 2022 zaadnoordijk et al 2019 within this study the selection criterion impacts the regression and correlation analyses with the model parameters the strength of correlations could change with different model selection criteria or with a different threshold value over 40 environmental variables were used in the study to characterize the sites of the monitoring wells the variables covered five groups geologic topographic boundary climatic and land cover however the head is also influenced by other factors such as soil texture chaudhuri and ale 2014 szymkiewicz et al 2019 but soil data is available at different quality and coverage in the baltics kmoch et al 2021 furthermore some of the variables were calculated over a specified radius 500 m since both local and regional processes influence head variability multiple radii values could have been used to gain more insights the influence of physical processes is not limited to a certain buffer distance but rather process based locations for example recharge and discharge points to improve the representativeness of the environmental variables a more thorough value calculation of the variables should be performed there is further potential in making groundwater related data more readily accessible for regular assessments and forecasts kmoch et al 2016 the dataset used for both correlation and regression analyses of the model fit 336 monitoring wells was large enough for the insights to be representative for the parameter studies however only 33 monitoring well data were used therefore the results can present a distorted impression and should be interpreted carefully additionally more environmental variables than time series were used indicating that the random forest models could have been overfitted a larger dataset for the parameter value studies could give more precise insight into the correlations there are initiatives underway that could support accessibility to larger scale harmonized data for such use cases that could be considered for groundwater data and the baltics as well addor et al 2017 2020 virro et al 2021 the shap values for multiple variables were very low indicating that only some of the variables impacted the predicted nse value therefore we chose to describe and analyze only the 5 most influential ones however the interpretation could be more insightful if the rf models were refitted and shap values recalculated with lower number of environmental variables thus the regression could be improved by performing forward feature selection whereby a random forest model is fitted first on each variable separately models are further developed with the highest scoring variable and one of the others again determining the highest score and so on it is repeated until adding an additional variable does not significantly improve the model fit e g virro et al 2022 macedo et al 2019 thus the most influential variables are determined further shap values could be subsequently analyzed and mapped for each separate monitoring well which could give insights into regional differences of the most influencing environmental variables 5 conclusion head time series from 460 monitoring wells were modeled using time series models with impulse response functions only precipitation potential evaporation and temperature were used as driving forces for each time series four different model structures with different levels of complexity were used from the 460 time series in the data set 145 could be modeled well during the calibration period with at least one of the model structures only 68 time series could be modeled well with at least one of the models during the validation period of the four model structures the nonlinear model with snow processes included nls most often resulted in a good fit this suggests that snow is an important process to take into account when modeling heads in the baltics the fit of the model measured as nse in the calibration period showed only weak correlations with the environmental variables some patterns however did appear from the results the model fit correlates most strongly with the geological and climatic setting of the monitoring well these results suggest that these models in combination with the used driving forces are most appropriate for modeling heads measured in monitoring wells with shallow groundwater and lower precipitation seasonality correlations between parameter values and the environmental variables were also observed larger values for the gain and time lag parameters were generally found for locations with deeper water tables less permeable sediments and higher altitudes the relatively small number of time series that could be modeled well in this study may be explained by the limited number of driving forces that were used we emphasize here that many of the wells are likely to be influenced by other driving forces such as groundwater pumping and surface water levels and that adding these to the models may substantially improve the simulation of the heads nonetheless we believe that the proposed methodology may help to gain a better understanding of the relationships between model performance model parameters and environmental and climatic settings both the good and the bad models provide insights that could direct future investigations into the groundwater in the baltic states for example as the initial analysis before the development of a distributed model or when input data

7689,study region the baltic countries estonia latvia lithuania north eastern europe study focus time series models are a convenient tool for modeling hydraulic head time series due to their parsimonious parameterization and quick calculation time however it is unclear how the model structure and the outcome relate to the respective site characteristics time series modeling with impulse response functions was used to model the head time series the correlations between the model performance and the environmental settings and between the model parameters and the environmental settings were analyzed using spearman rank correlation and random forest regression analyses new hydrological insights from the 460 analyzed head time series 145 were modeled with satisfactory goodness of fit in the calibration period using only precipitation potential evaporation and temperature as model inputs this number decreased to 68 time series with a satisfactory fit in the validation period including additional drivers in wells where a substantial influence is characteristic could improve modeling results the model results suggest that snow processes are affecting head dynamics in many

supply to ecosystems kløve et al 2011 and for human consumption kitterød et al 2022 replenishment recharge and depletion discharge abstraction of the groundwater resources have a strong seasonal character driven by changing weather patterns as a result strong seasonal and intra seasonal fluctuations of groundwater hydraulic heads hereafter heads are observed worldwide jasechko et al 2014 head dynamics are affected by various environmental factors including climate land use and cover vegetation geological setting and artificial abstraction many environmental processes are controlled by local fluctuations of heads which are as diverse as greenhouse gas emissions from soils evans et al 2021 mander et al 2022 leaching and attenuation of fertilizers and pesticides from farmlands baran et al 2021 marsala et al 2020 or river base flow hendriks et al 2014 to gain valuable insights into the aforementioned processes a robust and simple method to model heads would be beneficial the models used to simulate heads vary in their level of complexity both in spatial and temporal discretization and the level of represented physical processes relatively simple one dimensional lumped parameter models use time series of input drivers and calibration targets without considering the physical characteristics of the studied location devia et al 2015 since only a point in space is modeled e g head fluctuations in monitoring well in the study of mackay et al 2014 spatial conclusions drawn from individual instances of such models may not be valid although this is a substantial drawback of the modeling approach as compared to distributed process based models lumped parameter models require a lower amount of input data a shorter calibration time and a lower effort for model development while generally good model fits are obtained bakker and schaars 2019 time series models using impulse response functions irf as proposed by von asmuth et al 2002 are lumped parameter models that translate precipitation and other drivers into the output the head it has been shown that the use of such models is a simple and effective method for predicting head fluctuations e g marchant and bloomfield 2018 the impulse response function characterizes head response to an impulse of a driver such as a precipitation event von asmuth et al 2001 the function can take various shapes and thus is capable of describing a broad range of possible relationships between the impulse precipitation or another driver and the response the head bakker et al 2008 2007 von asmuth et al 2002 being a lumped parameter model a model instance is created for each head time series individually collenteur et al 2019 time series models with impulse response functions have been applied to a variety of problems ranging from gap filling of time series peterson and western 2018 hindcasting babre et al 2022 to recharge estimation collenteur et al 2021 hocking and kelly 2016 another common application is to quantify the effects of different drivers on the heads brakenhoff et al 2022 shapoori et al 2015b van dijk et al 2020 these models can be calibrated to head time series with irregular measurements bierkens et al 1999 as is the case for most historical groundwater level observations retike et al 2022 careful consideration should be given to selecting an appropriate model structure a good resulting fit of time series models indicates that the head fluctuations can be explained well by the explanatory series a low fit on the other hand can be caused by missing or non representative input drivers or model structural errors among other reasons zaadnoordijk et al 2019 a linear precipitation excess model calculates recharge as the difference between precipitation and evaporation a nonlinear recharge model on the other hand also considers moisture retention in the soil and the limitation of actual evaporation by soil moisture availability this can improve the simulation of the heads peterson and western 2014 collenteur et al 2021 recently collenteur 2022 extended a nonlinear recharge model with a degree day snow model e g kavetski and kuczera 2007 to

obergfell et al 2013 shapoori et al 2015a to the best knowledge of the authors correlations between the irf parameters and the environmental variables were only systematically explored in a study of switzerland with a limited number of wells collenteur 2022 the study showed that such relations may exist but also concluded that additional research with more data is required the aim of this study is to systematically analyze and better understand the relationships between 1 the environmental variables and the model fit and 2 the environmental variables and the model parameter values to achieve these aims the following steps were taken in the first step head time series from the baltic countries were modeled using four different model structures with increasing complexity in the second step the differences in goodness of fit between the model structures were compared using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse in the third step the correlation between the model fit nse and the environmental variables was explored with the spearman rank correlation analysis in the fourth step random forest rf regression models were built with environmental variables as predictors and nse values as the prediction target to gain additional insights into the variables that may explain where a model structure works well and where not to explore the correlations between the environmental variables and the parameters determining the shape of irf steps 3 to 5 were repeated using the parameters describing the irf separately 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the baltic states estonia latvia and lithuania are located in the northeast of europe and span 175 117 km 2 kriauciuniene et al 2012 they belong to the snow climate fully humid with warm summers d f b köppen geiger climate classification type beck et al 2018 kottek et al 2006 locally the climate varies between maritime and continental climates in the west east direction with additional variations in the north south direction and based on orography where a lower temperature and higher precipitation are characteristic in the highlands bethere et al 2017 the mean annual precipitation ranges between 600 mm and over 800 mm per year jaagus et al 2010 the highest elevation point is just over 300 m a s l and s sw winds prevail pogumirskis et al 2021 2 2 hydrogeological setting the study area is located in the baltic artesian basin and the three baltic countries cover most of its terrestrial part the baltic artesian basin is a multi layered sedimentary basin with vast amounts of groundwater kitterød et al 2022 it consists of many aquifers forming three principal zones according to water exchange intensity stagnant passive and active water exchange zones the latter of which is predominantly used for water supply lukševičs et al 2012 aquifers typically consist of weakly cemented terrigenous and carbonate rocks and evaporites are less common the principal zones are separated from each other by regional aquitards which are formed mostly of marls and clays kitterød et al 2022 the active water exchange zone is formed by cambrian vendian northern estonia silurian ordovician central and western estonia upper middle devonian southern estonia latvia lithuania and cenozoic mesozoic lithuania aquifer systems kitterød et al 2022 quaternary deposits glacial glaciolacustrine glaciofluvial and marine sediments are very heterogeneous and form the upper part of the active water exchange zone over bedrock aquifers with a thickness of a few meters in the northwestern part of the territory and the lowlands up to 200 meters in the uplands and more than 300 meters in the buried valleys popovs et al 2015 2022 although less so than the deeper bedrock aquifers quaternary groundwater is also used for centralized and decentralized water supply and is a major source of water for groundwater dependent ecosystems kalvāns et al 2021 terasmaa et al 2020 2 3 data collection and preparation 2 3 1 hydraulic head data the head data were obtained from various organizations responsible for maintaining head monitoring networks in the baltic states the republic of estonia environment agency the latvian environment geology

respective station if applicable coordinates the elevation of the monitoring well the respective aquifer well screen and depth to groundwater information varying start and end dates and data gaps with different lengths are present in the data the monitoring frequency of heads varied from a few measurements per year to twice a day measurements the automatic data logging two measurements per day started after 2004 in lithuania and after 2009 in estonia and latvia the raw head measurements were pre processed using the four eye principle and expert judgment following the methodology outlined in retike et al 2022 we deleted visible outliers and corrected shifts and systematic errors i e errors caused by automatic logger problems short term abstraction impacts human introduced and other miscellaneous errors the time series used for the analysis were selected based on two criteria first the required length of the time series was set to 15 years with no more than 12 data gaps where a data gap corresponded to a month where there were no observations if the length of the time series was longer the most recent 15 years of data were selected it ensures that the time series contain more observations since generally the measuring frequency was higher in the most recent years the data for periods where two measurements per day were taken was averaged to daily data as part of the pre processing step the second criterion was that the time series do not have a substantial trend during the calibration period chosen as the first ten years of the 15 year time series the trend analysis was performed by calculating sen s slopes sen 1968 before the calculation time series were aggregated by the mean over 3 month time steps such a value was chosen because a regular time step between measurements was necessary to perform the trend analysis additionally this aggregation step was chosen to balance between decreasing the noise that might impact the calculated trend and maintaining enough entries in the time series for the test given the varying frequencies in the head data the head values were re scaled in the range 0 1 by subtracting the mean and dividing over the range of the values we argue that small trends in the head data may be explained by trends in the explanatory time series selecting only time series with a slope of zero would exclude head time series that may still be explained well with the input data used in this study therefore the choice for the threshold value was made semi quantitatively its value was determined as the elbow point in the histogram of all slope values bins 20 the elbow point is the inflection point where the curvature changes and it was determined visually an additional visual evaluation was subsequently performed on a subset of the series below the determined threshold to ensure that it corresponds to series that are approximately stationary time series with a median slope of less than or equal to 0 07 in absolute values per 3 months were selected for further modeling the resulting data set after the different pre processing steps is as follows of the original data set with 1671 time series 735 time series cover a minimum 15 year period of these 735 time series 460 had a slope smaller or equivalent to the chosen slope threshold 0 07 over 3 months for the re scaled head series in the calibration period these 460 time series are used for further analysis in the remainder of this paper the locations of the selected monitoring wells are shown in fig 1 2 3 2 meteorological data the daily precipitation sum and the mean maximum and minimum temperature data were obtained from the european climate assessment dataset e obs gridded data ensemble v 25 0e resolution 0 1 cornes et al 2018 the potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated using the hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 from the temperature data the time series of all of these drivers are available from the year 1953 to 2021 2 3 3 environmental variables to determine the correlations between the environmental setting of the monitoring well the model fit and the parameters of the impulse response functions a set of environmental variables were derived from climatic topographic geologic and boundary data following haaf et al 2020 this data set was further extended with land cover variables in total 11 climatic 15 geological 7 boundary 5 land cover and 8 topographic variables were computed summarized in table 1 the histograms of the environmental variables can be seen in fig s2 of the supplement the geological variables were prepared using the lithology and geological cross section data from popovs et al 2015 and virbulis et al 2013 the lithology data contained 12 unique classes the dataset contained information on the geological indices and the depth of both the top and the bottom of the geological layers present in each of the cross sections the boundary variables were calculated using a digital elevation model dem with a 10 m resolution compiled from respective 10 m dems from the republic of estonia land board republic of estonia land board 2022 the latvian geospatial information agency latvian geospatial information agency 2022 the lithuanian geological survey provided upon request and water body data from open street map geofabrik gmbh and contributors of open street map 2018 the topography parameters were calculated for 500 m buffers around the monitoring wells using the compiled dem the climatic variables were calculated using daily mean temperature and daily precipitation from the e obs data for the respective 10 year period of calibration using the closest cell center values for each monitoring well the land cover variables were extracted over a 500 m buffer around the monitoring well from the copernicus corine land cover clc data european environment agency 2018 version 2018 to the first level e g group 1 artificial surfaces and the area within the buffer was summarized 2 4 methods 2 4 1 time series modeling using impulse response functions time series models using impulse response functions irf are used to model the head time series von asmuth et al 2002 predefined response functions are used to characterize the head response to a unit pulse of a driver e g precipitation in this study daily precipitation potential evaporation and mean temperature data are used as drivers the head at each time step is modeled as a superposition of the lagged driver impacts the value of the driver of each lagged time step is multiplied by the impulse response value of the respective time step and subsequently summed the shape and size of the response function are described by only a few parameters which are estimated by fitting the simulated head time series to the observed the choice for a certain irf type depends on its capability to characterize the head response accurately a scaled gamma distribution function is often used to simulate the head response to different drivers e g von asmuth et al 2008 the impulse response function is written as 1 θ p t a t n 1 a n γ n e t a for t 0 where a a and n are parameters that describe the shape of the response function alternatively a four parameter function may be used bakker et al 2008 for which the impulse response function is approximated as follows 2 θ p t a t n 1 e t a a b t for t 0 where a n a b are the shape parameters of the response function for both response functions the parameter a corresponds to the gain of the system the magnitude of the impact and the parameters n and a determine the shape i e larger values of n and a simulate a more lagged response to an impulse of a driver the parameter b of the four parameter function eq 2 allows for a larger delay in the response by shifting the response in time the parameter values of the different impulse response functions are unknown and need to be inferred from the data two approaches are applied to account for precipitation and potential evaporation in the model a linear precipitation excess model and a nonlinear root zone model these models are only briefly introduced here and we refer to collenteur et al 2021 and references therein for a more detailed explanation the linear model assumes a linear relationship between precipitation and evaporation the nonlinear model on the other hand accounts for the nonlinear response of the head to precipitation and evaporation this nonlinear model assumes that the system can be modeled as two connecting reservoirs an interception and root zone reservoirs thus including short term water retention in the soil in the calculations under certain conditions a linear model combined with a more complex impulse response function can produce results similar to those of the root zone model however as also stated by peterson and western 2018 the missing soil moisture representation may introduce possible errors if snow processes e g snowfall and snowmelt are of importance a snow reservoir may be added on top of the nonlinear model collenteur 2022 in general it can be assumed that the model that is most appropriate for each individual monitoring well is unknown a multi model approach is therefore applied here assessing the performance of four different model structures with increasing complexity to simulate the heads these include linear and nonlinear approaches to take precipitation and evaporation into account combined with a gamma or four parameter function to describe the shape of the response the models used in the study were from the simplest to the most complex a linear model with gamma function lg a linear model with a four parameter function l4 a nonlinear model with a gamma function nlg and a nonlinear snow model with a gamma function nls see table 2 different hydrological processes are represented in these models and the models have an increasing amount of parameters that need to be estimated 2 4 2 model calibration and evaluation the models were calibrated by fitting the simulated heads to the observed ones the residuals of models simulating head time series often show strong autocorrelation and are therefore first modeled with an auto regressive noise model of order one ar1 the resulting noise time series which should have reduced autocorrelation compared to the raw model residuals is then minimized using a nonlinear least squares approach the parameters were estimated first without the noise model and subsequently with a noise model to ensure better parameter calibration for a thorough explanation of this calibration process readers are referred to von asmuth and bierkens 2005 and collenteur et al 2021 the models were calibrated over a 10 years period it should be noted that the start and end dates of calibration for each monitoring well change depending on the available head data for that well a warmup period of 10 years was applied and the modeling time step was 1 day the performance of the ar1 noise model was evaluated with the non parametric stoffer toloi test to determine whether the autocorrelation is significantly different from zero on non equidistant time series a significance level of 0 05 was used the model fit was determined by a combination of an evaluation metric and visual evaluation as suggested by bennett et al 2013 legates and mccabe 1999 moriasi et al 2007 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the root mean squared error rmse were calculated nse is the ratio between the variance of the residuals and the variance of the observations with resulting values in the range 1 a value above zero indicates that the simulation gives a better result than using the mean of the values gupta and kling 2011 knoben et al 2019 the rmse values span 0 moriasi et al 2015 and are in the units of measure legates and mccabe 1999 both metrics were calculated for the calibration and validation periods separately models reaching the threshold of 0 65 for nse and passing visual evaluation does the simulation follow the trend of the observations in the calibration period were determined as having a good fit the rmse values were used to additionally assess the model fit but not used as a threshold because the amplitudes of the head series were different mann whitney u test e g nachar 2008 was performed on the obtained nse values over the calibration period of the different model structures to determine if the resulting difference is statistically significant 2 4 3 assessing correlations between model performance model parameterization and the environmental variables to investigate if changes in the model performance and calibrated parameter values correspond to those of the independent environmental variables correlation and regression analyses were performed the aim of these analyses is twofold 1 to determine which model structures work best in which environmental settings as quantified by the environmental variables and 2 to investigate how the parameters of the response function are related to the environmental settings for the first purpose the nse value of a model during the calibration period is used here to quantify the model performance for the analysis between the model performance and the environmental variables the nse values during the calibration period of all models irrespective of the model fit were used for the analysis concerning the parameters a n and a of the irf however the analysis was performed on the parameter values of the models that reached a good fit for all model structures using only the time series where all model structures passed the threshold ensures that the models could reasonably quantify the head fluctuations with the calibrated parameters for both analyses an equal subset of the time series was used for all four model structures thus the observed strength of relations could be compared between model structures to determine if the nse or parameter values are related to the value of environmental variables a non parametric spearman rank correlation analysis was performed this was done for each environmental variable and the nse or irf parameter values for each model structure separately both the correlation coefficients and their statistical significance were calculated the significance level used to determine if the correlations are significant was set to 0 05 subsequently a random forest regression was applied together with a shapely additive explanations shap values analysis and plotting partial dependence random forest is a widely used non parametric machine learning approach for regression problems the prediction is obtained by creating decision trees from randomly selected inputs and averaging their outcome the advantages of this regression approach include robustness to overfitting breiman 2001 and its explainability the concept of shap values has recently been demonstrated to be useful to quantify the impact of each explanatory variable on the prediction in machine learning models e g stream nutrients in virro et al 2022 or groundwater levels in wunsch et al 2022 the shap values can be calculated both globally dataset wide and locally individual instances and reveal the direction of the association a positive or negative contribution lipovetsky and conklin 2001 the values are in the units of the prediction target and therefore simple to interpret molnar 2022 for random forest models the purpose adjusted treeexplainer was used to calculate the shap values lundberg et al 2020 the shap value analysis is often combined with partial dependence plots the plots visualize the contribution of an explanatory variable on the prediction target after the average impacts of other variables have been removed the marginal effect friedman and meulman 2003 the plots reveal if the association is linear non linear or monotonic molnar 2022 for further details the readers are referred to friedman 2001 the nse and the irf parameters of each of the model structures lg l4 nlg and nls were analyzed separately using the respective environmental variables as the independent variables and the nse or parameter values as the prediction target since the rf model does not accept empty input values the monitoring wells with at least one missing environmental variable value were eliminated before the regression analysis the default random forest parameters n estimators 100 max depth none min samples split 2 were used both the average and individual shap values were calculated the partial dependence was plotted for 10 variables with the highest influence 3 results 3 1 overall model performances each of the 460 time series selected for the analysis was modeled with the four different model structures in total 1840 models were created of the 1840 models 334 models corresponding to 145 out of 460 unique monitoring wells had a good fit in the calibration period i e they reached or exceeded the chosen metric threshold the nls model structure performed the best having the highest number of models with a good fit 34 of the models respectively table 3 the nlg model structure scored the lowest with 20 of models with a good fit of the 334 models 131 reached the metric threshold in the validation period 68 unique monitoring wells the highest count of models with a good fit was again for the nls model 31 with the lg l4 and nlg model structures all achieving lower numbers a visual evaluation was performed on the hydrographs of the models that exceeded the goodness of fit thresholds in the validation period no models were discarded showing that the goodness of fit metric and its threshold sufficed as an evaluation in this study fig 2 shows boxplots of the goodness of fit metrics for all four model structures for both the calibration upper row and the validation period lower row the median nse of the calibration period varied between 0 45 and 0 52 for the four model structures this indicates that the models have a notable difference in modeling performance the nls model structure had the highest average nse value and the nlg model structure scored the lowest the mann whitney u test revealed that the difference in performance between both model structures is statistically significant for any other combination of the model structures there was no significant difference the rmse values are in the same units as the studied variable in this study in meters all of the model structures had similar rmse values in the calibration period with a difference of 1 cm between medians and they varied between 21 and 22 cm the median amplitude the maximum diversion from the mean of the time series was 90 cm therefore the obtained rmse compared against the median amplitude of the time series indicates that the heads were generally simulated well in the validation period all median metrics were worse than those in the calibration period this indicates that less of the groundwater level variability in that period was captured compared to the calibration period the l4 model structure had the highest nse median value and the nlg model structure scored the lowest however none of the differences between model structures were statistically significant like in the calibration period all model structures had very similar median rmse values 0 27 and 0 28 and they had increased by 6cm as compared to the calibration period many of the models showed particularly low performance during the validation period i e nse below zero a visual inspection of the results showed that these low fits in the validation period were caused by strong trends in the head data during that period which was not checked for the presence of trends we illustrate the results of model performance based on the structure with an example of well 2010 in estonia see fig 3 the nls model structure performed best in replicating the extremes especially in the colder months of the year from the remaining three model structures the nlg performed the best at replicating both peaks and lows while both linear models performed the poorest the obtained nse values for model structures are similarly ordered the nls model structure had nse over 0 7 for both calibration and validation periods followed by the nlg and l4 nse between 0 4 0 5 the lg performed the poorest with nse values of 0 25 and 0 3 in the calibration and validation periods respectively a stoffer toloi test was performed to evaluate the autocorrelation in the noise series across the model structures no significant autocorrelation was detected for approximately 33 to 42 of the models depending on the model structure the nls model resulted in the largest number of models without significant autocorrelation 196 models out of 460 models followed by the nlg 169 models the poorest results were obtained with both linear model structures 154 models for l4 and 158 for lg 3 2 correlation between environmental variables and model fit since the same monitoring well data was used for all model types 460 unique monitoring wells the correlation coefficients can be directly compared between the model structures overall low correlation coefficients were obtained see fig 4 the model fit described with the nse value most strongly correlated with various climatic variables both those that describe the average yearly meteorological conditions t avg pe avg and the seasonality effects si meanpwettest meanpdriest ai notably all model structures fits had negligible correlations with the average yearly precipitation p avg not displayed it indicates that the changes in model fit correspond with the respective precipitation seasonality more specifically a higher model fit is associated with lower precipitation seasonality for all model fits lower seasonality index more precipitation in the driest season and less precipitation in the wettest season additionally the model fit of nls had negligible correlations with those climatic variables that depend on temperature such as t avg pe avg and ai the model fit of nls correlated less with the precipitation seasonality variables it indicates that the nls model structure is the most robust model structure considering the seasonality setting of the monitoring wells the fit of both linear models was inversely correlated to the placement of the groundwater table described with the variables depth to gw and screen upp as well as the aquifer thickness a thickness namely more shallow groundwater level and thinner aquifer in study site corresponded to a higher model fit a similar conclusion could apply to the nlg model structure although a significant correlation was present only with one of the variables various lithology variable correlations with the model fit indicate that the model fit positively correlates with increasing thickness of highly permeable sediments gravel m and negatively with increasing thickness of less permeable sediments such as clay silt m however the lack of statistical significance and negligible correlation coefficients of other lithology groups indicates that within this study there is not enough evidence to reliably claim it in addition to the correlation analysis a regression analysis was performed based on the interpretable random forest rf algorithm on the data from 336 unique monitoring wells the 336 monitoring wells out of 460 selected for groundwater modeling correspond to those that remained after eliminating monitoring wells with missing environmental variables the obtained model fits r 2 varied between 0 85 0 89 indicating that the nse for all model structures could be predicted well from the selected environmental variables these variables were not used as input in modeling the groundwater level with the time series models therefore the relationships obtained with rf are an indirect interpretation that nevertheless can reveal valuable insights the shap values were used to analyze which environmental factors primarily explain the variation in nse among the different models the summary shap plot for all model structures is visualized in fig 5 displayed in the order of average importance descending the most important characteristics for prediction of model fit across all model structures were the geological depth to gw screep upp and climatic si meanpwettest and t avg setting of the monitoring wells while the absolute shap values describe the general impact of the variable on the nse values the summary plot allows exploring the direction of the impact for all model structures both larger values of depth to gw and screen upp contribute negatively to the model fit indicating that a higher fit is achieved for wells where the groundwater was more shallow similarly higher values of the climatic variables si seasonality index for both linear models and meanpwettest for both nonlinear models decreased the model fit indicating that for monitoring wells with more pronounced precipitation seasonality a lower fit of the models might be achieved however the climatic variable t avg present for all but nls structure contributed positively to the model fit while on average each variable had a minor influence on the nse value 0 05 the influence was substantial in individual locations for example a deeper upper level of the screen high values of variable screen upp decreased the model fit value by more than 0 5 for the lg model structure or up to 0 3 for the nlg model structure similarly deeper groundwater level higher values of the variable depth to gw contributed to decreasing the model fit by up to 0 2 or 0 3 depending on both the model structure and specific instance other variables with substantial local influence were the seasonality index for l4 and the topographic wetness index for the nls model structure across the four model structures a larger contribution was evident towards decreasing the nse value the highest positive influence on the model fit however was by the depth of groundwater level and the mean yearly temperature for the l4 model structure the nse value was increased by only up to 0 1 selected partial dependence plots are shown in fig 6 partial dependence plots provide insights into the impact of the value of the studied variable e g depth to the water table on the resulting model fit hence thresholds of impact can be determined by reading the horizontal axis where the variable values are displayed the influence of the variable t avg for the nlg model structure increases substantially from the 5 5 c mark the influence of the variable depth to gw is highest until the 2 m mark after which it drops and evens out in the case of the variable meanpwettest for the nls model structure partial dependence increased until around the 75 mm mark and subsequently decreased see the supplementary material figs 3 to 6 for partial dependence plots of the top 10 variables of all model structures 3 3 correlation between the environmental variables and the parameterization of irf the correlation analysis was performed for the parameters a n and a that describe the shape and size of the irf weak to medium correlation coefficients were obtained the resulting correlations for all model structures and the three parameters are shown in figs 7 8 and 9 the parameter a that characterizes the gain of the system significantly correlates with various lithology variables fig 7 with gravel m the correlation coefficient was negative more gravel means smaller gains while it was positive with the variable silt loam m which are less permeable sediments similarly negative correlations were present with the variables limestone m and marl m this indicates that the parameter a value is larger in locations with thicker low permeability sediments and smaller where more of less permeable sediments are present thus positively correlating with low permeability additionally the gain parameter was larger where the groundwater table was deeper positive correlation with depth to gw but the respective aquifer was thinner negative a thickness the parameter a was present in monitoring wells higher in the topography revealed by the value of a was larger when hgthps were higher and cnvr and cncv were lower mostly the significant correlations were shared between the model types e g pe avg for both nonlinear model structures or were individual the reason could be that the dataset could be too small to make reliable statistical claims or there indeed are differences between the correlations based on model types the shared correlation with limestone m indicates that different model types linear or nonlinear can correlate differently to some characteristics of the environmental setting the parameter n determines the time lag in the head response to the recharge or precipitation excess signals the positive correlations with variables depth to gw and screen upp fig 8 indicate that the value of n is larger in instances of a thicker unsaturated zone additionally the parameter value is higher where a thicker silt layer in the profile larger values of variable silt loam m is present similar to the parameter a a higher parameter n value is characteristic higher in the topography based on both hgthps and arbel variables and in locations with more pronounced rainfall seasonality variables si and meanpwettest the parameter a of the irf similar to the parameter n correlated to the depth of water table variables depth to gw and screen upp in addition the parameter of both linear model structures lg and l4 positively correlated with the absolute and relative elevation of the observation well hgthps and height ow while within this dataset positive correlations were obtained for both nonlinear models also there is not enough statistical evidence to claim that the correlations are significant similarly a negative correlation with marl m and a positive one with gravel m could mean that the parameter a correlates to the permeability of sediments however there is not enough statistical evidence 4 discussion 4 1 modeling hydraulic heads in the baltics application of the time series models on the 460 head time series selected for the analysis resulted in 145 monitoring wells where at least one model structure had a good fit with the head data this result shows that for about a third of the monitoring wells 30 it is possible to simulate the heads with reasonable accuracy using relatively simple models and only a few driving forces as such these monitoring wells appear to observe mostly natural fluctuations with relatively little impact from anthropogenic influences these results are in line with those from zaadnoordijk et al 2019 who found in a large scale study in the netherlands that less than half of the wells could be modeled satisfactorily with only precipitation and evaporation as driving forces for the remaining 70 of the monitoring wells in this study the results can be interpreted as an indication that other drivers may influence the heads e g pumping surface water levels the importance of other driving forces should not be unexpected as monitoring networks are often established with the purpose of monitoring human influences or changes on the groundwater as also suggested by zaadnoordijk et al 2019 including these additional drivers such as surface water fluctuations and pumping in the models could improve the results adding additional drivers to improve the modeling results is relatively easy for the type of model used in this study as shown in von asmuth et al 2008 for example based on the results of this study we recommend testing the use of additional input data to model the heads such as groundwater pumping and river stage data if such data is available only 131 models reached the goodness of fit thresholds in the validation period one reason for the decline in the model performance in the validation period is the presence of trends revealed from a visual inspection that could not be explained by the driving forces that were used checking for trends over both the calibration and validation period rather than only the calibration period as was done now could have prevented this this would however lead to a higher number of wells rejected from the analysis and not to more models with a good fit to increase the model fit including a linear trend in the model would be an option to try and improve the model fit without information on the cause of such trends this would however not lead to a better system understanding and was therefore judged outside the scope of this study the most appropriate model structure to simulate the heads will depend on the environmental settings of the monitoring well some general patterns however became apparent from the modeling results the nonlinear snow model with a gamma response function resulted in the highest number of models with a good fit high median metrics were also obtained for the linear model with a four parameter response function thus both model structures appear to be more applicable than the other models for a large number of wells in the baltics the improvement associated with the nls model structure over the other models can mostly be attributed to the inclusion of snow processes in this model as none of the other models included this process the linear four parameter function model can represent the delayed head response due to snow processes by shifting the response in time based on these results we conclude that when modeling the heads in the baltic countries it is important to account for the presence of snow cover when the temperatures are below zero this is in line with the general perception of the importance of these processes on the hydrological regime in the baltics e g kriauciuniene et al 2012 jaagus et al 2017 it is expected that these models will also perform better in other snow dominated regions around the world 4 2 the correlation between the environmental variables and the model fit or the model parameterization the obtained coefficients in correlation studies were weak to moderate however they give an insight into similarities between the placement of the monitoring well and the modeling outcome from the five groups of environmental variables the strongest correlations with the model fit were found with geological and climatic variable groups more specifically the thickness of the unsaturated zone or the upper level of the well screen variables depth to gw and screen upp respectively were found to be two of the most important variables in both the correlation and regression analyses negatively impacting the model fit e g lower fits for deeper water tables aquifers we only speculate about possible reasons that may explain this finding here shallow groundwater generally responds more quickly to the precipitation signal but as the thickness increases the head response becomes lagged at a certain depth it is entirely independent of the signal wang et al 2022 this may decrease our ability to determine the association other possible reasons include inappropriate model structures and unknown drivers such as pumping that disproportionately affect deeper aquifers e g pumping for safe drinking water from the climatic variables the mean precipitation of the wettest quarter meanpwettest correlated with the nse of all model structures it characterizes the summed precipitation of the wettest season june july and august which in this study was also the warmest season in addition the mean precipitation of the driest quarter meanpdriest february march and april and the seasonality index si correlated with all model structures nse values and scored high in the top 10 variables in the regression analysis the monitoring wells in the baltics correspond to two classes of si values monitoring wells without precipitation seasonality si 0 19 and monitoring wells with a more pronounced wet season si 0 2 0 39 walsh and lawler 1981 the driest season corresponds to months with both snow cover february sometimes march and spring floods april the months when the infiltration is highly affected by the mean temperature the lowest correlations were present with the nse of the nls model structure where the mean daily temperature was used as model input this is an additional indication that the inclusion of snow processes improves the model fit for the baltic states the correlations of the climatic variables indicate that the model fit is affected by the precipitation seasonality the model fit was higher for the monitoring wells where the precipitation seasonality was less pronounced while similarities between model structure correlations were evident the coefficient values varied the nls model structure appeared to be more robust towards the climatic impact since there were fewer statistically significant correlations with the variables of the group there were instances where both linear models shared a significant correlation while both nonlinear models did not and vice versa it could indicate that changing the model type to nonlinear brings more substantial changes than increasing the complexity of the irf function it is necessary however to point out that correlation coefficients without statistical significance mean that there is not enough statistical evidence to claim that the correlation is significant but we cannot claim that there is no correlation we cannot accept the null hypothesis just fail to reject it amrhein et al 2019 therefore the results should not be taken at face value and should be evaluated in the context they represent further larger scale studies would be advisable thus our conclusions are affected by our chosen dataset the correlation analysis performed on the models with a good fit in the validation period not shown revealed that the significant correlation coefficients were moderate 0 3 0 5 as opposed to weak when the analysis was performed on all models the number of significant correlations decreased however most probably due to the decreased dataset the variables correlating with model fit were from the climatic group for the lg l4 and nlg model structures variables si ai meanpdriest and t avg and topographic and boundary arbel and height to stream for the nls model structure we stress that within this study the environmental variables were not used in the irf models as an input the rf models were built using the independent environmental variables as the predictors and the model fit obtained from the irf models as the prediction target thus links between the environmental setting and the model fit can be explored for models that need parsimonious input the obtained results of the shap value analysis reveal that depth to groundwater level seasonality index the upper level of the well screen and other variables can have substantial impacts on the resulting model fit up to 0 5 in absolute values depending on the selected model structure and environmental settings of the monitoring well the obtained partial dependence plots reveal that beyond the depth of 2 m the depth of groundwater has a close to uniform low impact on the modeling outcome similarly the yearly average temperature has the highest impact on the modeling outcome when the temperature is higher than 5 5 degrees and the mean precipitation in the wettest quarter is lower than 73 mm we note here that both methods assume independence of the features molnar 2022 which could have affected the obtained results conclusions drawn from shap values and partial dependence plots however could aid in pre screening wells where modeling could be applicable for the parameters of the irf moderate correlations with the independent topographic variables were observed besides both the geological and climatic variables among these variables describing the topographic location were present for the gain parameter a such as the variable hgthps the position of the well relative to the height range a higher parameter a and a value was observed in the monitoring wells higher in the topography and with thicker vadose zones similarly higher values of the parameter n which describes the time delay of the head response to a driver impulse were observed in monitoring wells higher in the catchment variable arbel some of the variables however can represent other processes and hence may be proxy values for different impacts for example the mean yearly temperature t avg can also represent the orography since lower temperatures on average are characteristic in the highlands bethere et al 2017 4 3 limitations and possibilities to investigate the correlations between the model parameters and the environmental variables only good models were selected the criterion of model selection could be improved in this study a good fit corresponded to exceeding a metric threshold here good is defined as passing a threshold of 0 65 for the nse which was arbitrarily set and a modelers choice if this threshold would be set to 0 5 already 818 and 380 models would have a good fit in the calibration and validation period respectively as opposed to 334 and 131 models respectively with the threshold of 0 65 different selection criteria have been used in other studies such as performing autocorrelation tests and determining the plausibility of the parameters e g brakenhoff et al 2022 zaadnoordijk et al 2019 within this study the selection criterion impacts the regression and correlation analyses with the model parameters the strength of correlations could change with different model selection criteria or with a different threshold value over 40 environmental variables were used in the study to characterize the sites of the monitoring wells the variables covered five groups geologic topographic boundary climatic and land cover however the head is also influenced by other factors such as soil texture chaudhuri and ale 2014 szymkiewicz et al 2019 but soil data is available at different quality and coverage in the baltics kmoch et al 2021 furthermore some of the variables were calculated over a specified radius 500 m since both local and regional processes influence head variability multiple radii values could have been used to gain more insights the influence of physical processes is not limited to a certain buffer distance but rather process based locations for example recharge and discharge points to improve the representativeness of the environmental variables a more thorough value calculation of the variables should be performed there is further potential in making groundwater related data more readily accessible for regular assessments and forecasts kmoch et al 2016 the dataset used for both correlation and regression analyses of the model fit 336 monitoring wells was large enough for the insights to be representative for the parameter studies however only 33 monitoring well data were used therefore the results can present a distorted impression and should be interpreted carefully additionally more environmental variables than time series were used indicating that the random forest models could have been overfitted a larger dataset for the parameter value studies could give more precise insight into the correlations there are initiatives underway that could support accessibility to larger scale harmonized data for such use cases that could be considered for groundwater data and the baltics as well addor et al 2017 2020 virro et al 2021 the shap values for multiple variables were very low indicating that only some of the variables impacted the predicted nse value therefore we chose to describe and analyze only the 5 most influential ones however the interpretation could be more insightful if the rf models were refitted and shap values recalculated with lower number of environmental variables thus the regression could be improved by performing forward feature selection whereby a random forest model is fitted first on each variable separately models are further developed with the highest scoring variable and one of the others again determining the highest score and so on it is repeated until adding an additional variable does not significantly improve the model fit e g virro et al 2022 macedo et al 2019 thus the most influential variables are determined further shap values could be subsequently analyzed and mapped for each separate monitoring well which could give insights into regional differences of the most influencing environmental variables 5 conclusion head time series from 460 monitoring wells were modeled using time series models with impulse response functions only precipitation potential evaporation and temperature were used as driving forces for each time series four different model structures with different levels of complexity were used from the 460 time series in the data set 145 could be modeled well during the calibration period with at least one of the model structures only 68 time series could be modeled well with at least one of the models during the validation period of the four model structures the nonlinear model with snow processes included nls most often resulted in a good fit this suggests that snow is an important process to take into account when modeling heads in the baltics the fit of the model measured as nse in the calibration period showed only weak correlations with the environmental variables some patterns however did appear from the results the model fit correlates most strongly with the geological and climatic setting of the monitoring well these results suggest that these models in combination with the used driving forces are most appropriate for modeling heads measured in monitoring wells with shallow groundwater and lower precipitation seasonality correlations between parameter values and the environmental variables were also observed larger values for the gain and time lag parameters were generally found for locations with deeper water tables less permeable sediments and higher altitudes the relatively small number of time series that could be modeled well in this study may be explained by the limited number of driving forces that were used we emphasize here that many of the wells are likely to be influenced by other driving forces such as groundwater pumping and surface water levels and that adding these to the models may substantially improve the simulation of the heads nonetheless we believe that the proposed methodology may help to gain a better understanding of the relationships between model performance model parameters and environmental and climatic settings both the good and the bad models provide insights that could direct future investigations into the groundwater in the baltic states for example as the initial analysis before the development of a distributed model or when input data is limited and a short calculation time is favored to support future investigations using the same methodology all the processed input data and code is made publicly available through a zenodo
