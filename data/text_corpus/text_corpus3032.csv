15160,the occurrence and fate of 17β estradiol e2 in natural water have gained extensive attention owing to its high ecotoxic risk to wildlife dissolved organic matter dom is a ubiquitous water constituent and contributes significantly to e2 removal although the reaction mechanism is rarely clarified the present study aims to investigate e2 transformation in water containing fresh or aged dom surrogates at environmentally relevant concentrations in the dark experiments along with radical probes of benzene and furfuryl alcohol reveal that reactive radicals particularly hydroxyl radical oh formed non photochemically at higher concentrations in aged dom than in fresh dom the contribution of oh in e2 removal is indicated by the decreases in the removal of radical probes in the presence of e2 moreover e2 removal is inhibited in the presence of radical scavengers the dose dependent inhibitive effect of substrate concentrations including e2 and coexistent propylparaben shows that the radical concentration is a limiting factor for e2 removal which could be enhanced by increasing dom concentration dissolved oxygen and light supply as the main byproduct estrone e1 is persistent in the current dom water in the dark but it can be easily photodegraded when exposed to light theoretical analysis reveals that the initial step is oh initiated h abstraction on the hydroxyl group in the cyclopentane ring of e2 the formed singlet excited state of e2 undergoes further intramolecular rearrangement and oxidative dehydrogenation to generate e1 and the hydroperoxy radical ho2 considering the universal occurrence of e2 in dom rich aquatic matrices the present findings have special implications for the biogeochemical cycle and risk assessment of this pollutant in natural aquatic environments particularly those beyond the photic zone graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reactive radicals steroid hormone humic acid h abstraction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction steroid hormone 17β estradiol e2 one of the most bioactive chemicals from in vivo steroidogenesis in mammals has specific estrogenic activity in maintaining normal growth development and reproduction in the body fortune 1994 in addition to its biogenic sources e2 is applied as drugs for the treatment of estrogenic deficiencies with doses of 1 2 mg orally once a day or external use or as an injection https www drugs com estradiol html this steroid hormone enters the aquatic system mainly through municipal wastewater effluent runoff from animal feeding operations and land applied manure patel et al 2019 e2 is of particular concern owing to its frequent detection in environmental water at concentrations of nanograms to micrograms per liter which can induce endocrine disruption in wildlife mills and chichester 2005 tiedeken et al 2017 according to e2 toxicity data based on priority indices the presence of this hormone at the detected concentrations poses a high risk to the most sensitive aquatic organisms liu et al 2020 the occurrence and risk of e2 are controlled by the natural attenuation in the aquatic environments which has recently gained extensive attention particularly our previous work on the contribution of biotic and abiotic processes shows that e2 removal is controlled mainly by the abiotic transformation of estuarine dissolved matter present in the water column yang et al 2016 dissolved organic matter dom which is composed of thousands of degradation byproducts as well as freshly produced compounds is a central component of biogeochemical cycles in aquatic ecosystems kellerman et al 2015 phytoplankton and bacteria release highly variable fractions of primary production into seawater as fresh dom jiao et al 2010 the amount of which can be substantial humic acid ha forms through the degradation of these microbial and plant precursors and represents a significant fraction of dom in aquatic environments klupfel et al 2014 ohno 2002 as an important constituent in natural water matrices dom is a key factor influencing the fate and toxicity of e2 increased concentrations of dom including ha can accelerate e2 sorption onto the sediment sun et al 2007 accelerate e2 photodegradation in water leech et al 2009 zhang et al 2007 affect microbial biodegradation of e2 gu et al 2016 inhibit laccase enabled e2 oxidation and oligomerization li and sun 2022 liu et al 2021 and decrease the estrogenicity of e2 in aquatic environments lee et al 2011 in addition dom exhibits a well known direct binding or coupling interaction with e2 through π π electron donor acceptor interaction and hydrogen bonding ma and yates 2018 the binding of estrogens to ha occurs most likely at the aromatic ring containing the hydroxyl group bedard et al 2014 yamamoto et al 2003 dom particularly that containing ha is composed of heterogeneous organic macromolecules that accept and donate electrons in many biogeochemical redox reactions at oxic anoxic interfaces kappler et al 2004 characterized by its primary light absorbing chromophores chromophoric dom cdom can photochemically generate highly reactive intermediates e g organic radicals and reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and superoxide o2 aiken et al 2011 cdom can also be excited by the absorption of a photon to form excited singlet and triplet states of cdom 1cdom and 3cdom respectively mcneill and canonica 2016 in addition ha forms humic metal complexes and can be reduced in anoxic systems owing to its redox active functional groups e g quinones lovley et al 1996 reactive oh is formed non photochemically in the dark through a fenton type mechanism in the presence of molecular oxygen o2 reduced ha and complexed iron page et al 2012 such processes are intriguing because they do not require sunlight and involve the aeration of anoxic water thus research is frequently conducted on the dark production of oh by aeration of anoxic water and sediment minella et al 2015 page et al 2013 tong et al 2016 these reactive species might induce electron transfer with organic compounds and promote their degradation indirectly although the radical mediated degradation of e2 in dom water is rarely reported in the literature reactive radicals are the main contributors to e2 removal during ultraviolet uv photolysis and advanced oxidation processes aops gabet et al 2021 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 zhang and li 2014 direct or indirect photodegradation of e2 in dom water has been widely reported leech et al 2009 mazellier et al 2008 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2021 however little is known about its removal in the dark aside from that the dark aphotic zone constitutes most water bodies in the aquatic ecosystems because of the light attenuation and during the diurnal cycle at night therefore e2 is expected to react with dom in the dark either through the direct binding or indirect degradation mediated by reactive radicals in addition the transformation of propylparaben to methylparaben mediated by oh in the presence of dom surrogates in the dark has been confirmed he et al 2021 however the underlying reaction mechanism contributing to the previously observed e2 removal by estuarine dissolved matter yang et al 2016 remains unknown to supplement the related knowledge based on the combination of experimental investigation with theoretical calculation the present study tends to investigate e2 transformation in water with the presence of fresh or aged dom surrogates as well as clarify the specific role of reactive radicals and the effects of varied water parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents ha cas 1415 93 6 purity

et al 2010 he et al 2021 silva et al 2016 2 effect of substrate concentration the effect of substrate concentration was evaluated considering two aspects different e2 concentrations at 10 50 and 100 μg l 1 and the presence of co existent pp at concentration of 0 10 100 and 1000 μg l 1 respectively this high concentration is based on the possibility of 1000 μg pharmaceutical e2 tablets being

was 110 61 120 90 and 72 56 kj mol 1 respectively proving that the formations of im1 im2 and e1 were thermodynamically favored the calculated energy barrier δg of the formation of im1 and e1 was 29 33 and 58 71 kj mol 1 respectively through which the second order rate constant k was calculated as 4 49 107 and 3 22 102 m 1 s 1 respectively because the ground state oxygen is a triplet state which could be considered a biradical system and therefore could induce barrierless addition to radicals no energy barrier is present in the transformation from im1 to im2 this result could indicate that the formation of e1 from im2 is a rate determining step in the present reaction 4 discussion significant amounts of phenol formation and ffa loss were detected in the dom spiked water and showed a positive correlation ben undergoes a fast reaction with oh to form phenol at a rate constant of 7 8 109 m 1 s 1 95 yield al housari et al 2010 vione et al 2006 ffa is easily oxidized by ros of both oh and 1o2 at rate constants of 1 5 10 10 and 1 2 10 8 m 1 s 1 respectively brame et al 2014 buxton et al 1988 ffa can also be removed by 3cdom or other species as reported in the literature al housari et al 2010 thus the concentration of phenol formed from ben indicates the specific cumulated oh concentration whereas the ffa loss indicates the sum of the contributions of oh 1o2 and 3cdom or other ros radicals these results imply that ros particularly oh were produced in dom water in the dark comparable oh levels were also observed by aeration of anoxic lake water in the dark using terephthalic acid as the probe reaction minella et al 2015 page et al 2012 dom appeared to be the main source for oh over most oceans mopper and zhou 1990 these dom surrogates are redox active organic macromolecules containing active functional moieties i e semiquinones and hydroquinones and complexed iron kappler et al 2004 lovley et al 1996 they are reduced in anoxic water thus the interaction of reduced dom with dissolved oxygen might non photochemically generate reactive oh through a fenton type mechanism even in the dark gligorovski et al 2015 page et al 2012 xiao et al 2020 compared with the fresh oms the aged ha exhibited higher aromaticity and more unsaturated bonds he et al 2021 which contributed to the higher ros production in ha relative to that in the ec and sc the presence of e2 substantially reduced the rate constant of phenol formation in all dom water types including the pw and ffa loss in the sc conversely the presence of ffa or ben substantially reduced the rate constant of e2 removal substantially in nearly all dom water types an exception is the ec in which the rate constant was reduced only by ffa the higher concentrations of tba 50 and 500 mg l 1 which is a specific scavenger for quenching oh al housari et al 2010 inhibited e2 removal a specific scavenger of higher nan3 concentration 1000 mg l 1 which can quench oh at a second order rate constant of 1 4 1010 m 1 s 1 al housari et al 2010 silva et al 2016 also inhibited e2 removal these inhibitive effects indicate competitive reactions of ros particularly oh which contributed significantly to e2 removal this conclusion is supported by the linear correlation of e2 removal kinetics with the concentrations of ffa loss or phenol formation in all dom groups this indicateds that oh in aquatic environments is the most reactive oxidant that can degrade chemicals nonselectively through photochemistry as well as in aops for example liu et al 2017 reported that oh is predominantly responsible for the indirect photodegradation of e2 the oh involvement in the indirect photo transformation of e2 has been widely reported in fenton and uv driven aops rosenfeldt and linden 2004 the results also showed enhanced e2 removal in the presence of lower nan3 concentrations 10 and 100 mg l 1 which might be attributed to the reaction of e2 with appropriate concentrations of azide radical n3 formed from the azide anion in the presence of oxygen he et al 2021 silva et al 2016 these results indicate that in addition to oh other ros radicals might contribute to the removal of e2 and ffa in water for example carbon centered radicals r c produced from the uv peracetic acid process have been recognized as predominant contributors to the degradation of e2 hu et al 2022 moreover a single electron to generate phenoxyl radicals of e2 and then the oligomerization products mediated by mn iii in the presence of ha under visible light irradiation has also been reported wang et al 2018 notably the presence of e2 in the pw enhanced ffa loss and the presence of ffa or ben in the pw enhanced thee2 removal a low concentration of 5 mg l 1 tba enhanced e2 removal in the ha water a similar result has been reported by wang et al 2020 such that a phenolic acid compound promoted on the photo removal of e2 from water under simulated sunlight irradiation additional supporting evidence has been reported for other chemicals such as significant enhancement of trichloroethylene degradation by adding a small amount of methane chang and criddle 1997 and increased enzymatic removal of refractory sulfamethoxazole in the presence of co existent sulfonamides yang et al 2018 these enhanced effects referred to as co metabolism indicate that one co existent chemical can act as an electron shuttle mediator for the removal of another chemical nguyen et al 2021 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2018 further enhanced removal of both ffa and e2 in the presence of another chemical was observed in the ec but not in the ha and sc this indicates that specific components existing in the ec might favor the removal process of these two chemicals our previous ftir analysis showed that compared to the ha and sc the ec exhibited a unique absorbance band at the wave number of 2854 cm 1 corresponding to the functional group of ch2 symmetric stretching vibration he et al 2021 however because the related information is limited in depth research should be conducted in the future the acid dissociation constant pka value for e2 has been reported as 10 23 10 4 neale et al 2009 westerhoff et al 2005 which indicates that the e2 is not ionized and hydrolyzed at the experimental ph value of 7 0 in the present work the decay rate constant k 1 60 14 26 10 7 s 1 and removal percentage r e 2 21 25 1 91 1 for e2 was higher in the ha than in the sc and ec the t1 2 was at 4 7 105 s equivalent to 5 5d in the ha which is shorter than that in ec and sc at 50 16 days respectively the observed value of e2 removal in the present study is comparable to the reported e2 biodegradation by quinone reducing bacteria with rate constants of 1 59 3 18 10 3 h 1 and t1 2 at 217 97 435 94 h gu et al 2016 moreover microorganisms in river water samples are capable of transforming e2 to e1 with half lives of 0 2 9 days jurgens et al 2002 further a decay constant of 0 33 d 1 and a t1 2 value of 3 12 days have been reported for the natural attenuation of e2 in a simulated estuary water system yang et al 2016 however the moderate removal rate of e2 in water in the present study is far lower than those in manual reinforcement processes such as photocatalysis and aop for example the rate constant of e2 in photolytic removal is 0 05 h 1 at a constant irradiance of 11 040 µmol m 2 650 w m2 leech et al 2009 the dose dependent inhibitive effect of substrate concentrations e2 and coexistent pp revealed ros concentration to being a limiting factor for e2 removal the e2 reacts rapidly with the oh at a second order rate constant of 0 53 1 41 1010 m 1 s 1 as determined by the competitive kinetics method or theoretical calculation rosenfeldt and linden 2004 zhao et al 2010 as the main contributor of e2 removal the cumulated oh concentration on day 21 was 0 23 μm in the ha water with a slow production rate whereas the corresponding e2 concentrations were at 0 037 0 184 and 0 367 μm in groups of 10 50 and 100 μg l 1 respectively according to the molar mass balance the oh production limited e2 removal thus it could be expected that the quantum yield of e2 removal is identical in these groups and a lower substrate concentration leads to a higher removal rate because oh contributing to pp removal he et al 2021 the competitive oh consumption by higher concentrations of co existent pp might have led to the reduced e2 removal moreover the ros production correlated with the aromaticity of the doms and the higher oh production leads to the higher removal of e2 in the ha than the ec and sc these observations are similar to the reported pp degradation mediated by oh in dom water he et al 2021 although numerous studies have shown that the binding of e2 to the dom surrogate occurs at the aromatic ring of e2 bedard et al 2014 yamamoto and liljestrand 2003 yamamoto et al 2003 or dom gu et al 2016 the well fitted linear relationship between e1 formation and e2 loss confirmed that e1 is the main byproduct of e2 in the present dom water along with the removal of e2 e1 is widely observed as the main byproduct or immediate product in an oxidation process by soil manganese oxides sheng et al 2009 biodegradation by bacteria li et al 2012 zhang et al 2022 enzymatic catalyzed reactions in the presence of ha li et al 2017 sun et al 2016 ε mno2 nanorods in ha solution sun et al 2020 heterogeneous photo fenton reaction zhao et al 2008 photo removal under simulated sunlight irradiation wang et al 2020 and the natural transformation product in simulated aquatic systems jurgens et al 2002 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 notably this observed product is different from the formation of aliphatic and hydroxylated byproducts in aops perondi et al 2020 or the self cross oligomeric products between e2 and model dom constituents li and sun 2022 compared to the corresponding parent e2 the estrogenic activity of e1 is relatively lower zhao et al 2008 this finding has implications for the self purification ability of natural ecosystem and the development of pollution control techniques in addition the r e 2 e 1 21 was maintained at relatively low values of 15 in nearly all treatments in the dark but increased to 55 2 and 84 2 when the light intensity increased to 2000 and 4000 lux respectively these observations indicate that e1 was persistent and could not be degraded in the current dom water in the dark but could be easily photodegraded when exposed to light rokhina and suri 2012 also indicated that e1 is more persistent to chemical oxidation because its computed stability index is significantly lower than that of e2 by theoretical analysis direct photolysis of e1 other than e2 in aqueous solutions has been shown to occur under irradiation using a high pressure mercury lamp λ 365 nm 125 w liu and liu 2004 this result is in line with the wavelength range of 310 750 nm applied in the present work one to three additional hydroxylations located on the aromatic ring of the parent e1 were reported as the main byproducts induced by photodegradation processes souissi et al 2012 photodegradation of e1 under simulated sunlight can be enhanced by the presence of 7 7 8 9 mg l 1 of dissolved organic carbon caupos et al 2011 e2 and its byproduct e1 share the same molecular framework which is composed of four rings a phenol ring two cyclohexane rings and a cyclopentane ring rokhina and suri 2012 the major configuration difference between the two chemicals is the cyclopentane ring at position c17 which has a hydroxyl group in e2 and a carbonyl group in e1 this indicates that the initial attack site of ros on e2 is the hydroxyl group in the cyclopentane ring rokhina and suri 2012 pointed out that in addition to the carbon atoms in the phenol ring the oxygen atoms of the carbonyl groups carbon and oxygen atoms in the cyclopentane ring can be attacked by oh as indicated by their high fukui functions moreover wang et al 2018 also found the higher charge densities 0 409 localized at the oxygen atoms of the carbonyl groups in the cyclopentane ring of e2 molecule have the greatest potential to be reaction sites in the present study the oh mediated e2 transformation to e1 was computerized by theoretical calculation e2 underwent h abstraction by oh attack at position c17 of the cyclopentane ring to form the im1 radical which can transform into im2 rapidly in the presence of dissolved ground state oxygen im2 underwent intramolecular rearrangement and oxidative dehydrogenation to generate e1 and the radical of ho2 the reactive species of ho2 might be a reason for the above observation e2 enhancing the ffa removal in the ec notably our result is slightly different from the theoretical proposition that the oh attack of carbon atoms at the aromatic ring of e2 with the subsequent formation of dihydroxy photoproducts and quinone like products rokhina and suri 2012 furthermore wang et al 2018 proposed that the o 19 of the e2 molecule might undergo the loss of one electron mediated by mn iii to form a radical intermediate and be subsequently oxidized to e1 it could be noted that the intermediate products of im1 and im2 deserve to be identified through high resolution mass spectrum analysis in the future the environmental factors favorable for ros formation and the reaction process can significantly enhance e2 removal as an important substrate the increase in ha concentration increased e2 removal in a dose dependent matter which is slightly different from the effect of ha on pp removal he et al 2021 this difference might be attributed to the fact that e2 can be removed not only by oh but also by other ros radicals or mediators whereas pp is removed only by oh do was found to be another substrate for ros formation in dom water the dioxygen dependent pathway for oh production has also been reported such that the apparent oh quantum yield in surface waters under aerobic conditions is significantly higher than that obtained anaerobically vaughan and blough 1998 molecular oxygen is also shown to be an important substrate for the formation of im2 from im1 by theoretical calculation thus a sufficient oxygen supply might accelerate the reaction process and enhance e2 removal because the light source provides energy gligorovski et al 2015 sun et al 2015 it is reasonable to predict that the processes of oh formation by interacting of dom and do can be enhanced significantly through light adsorption further because byproduct e1 can be easily photodegraded the lower concentration of accumulated e1 might accelerate the removal of parent e2 5 conclusion according to the concentration difference in radical probes accompanied by e2 removal oh is the most important contributor to e2 removal in dom water in the dark however other radicals and mediators might also exist and contribute to e2 removal compared with fresh doms aged dom matrices are more favorable for oh production and thus e2 removal e1 is the main byproduct from e2 removal and rather persistent in the present dom water in the dark but can easily be photodegraded when exposed to light considering the configuration difference the oh initiated h abstraction on the hydroxyl group in the cyclopentane ring of e2 was proposed to be the main reaction mechanism the increases in ha do and light intensity were favorable for the transformation process of e2 to e1 which provides operational implications for in situ pollution control considering the universal occurrence of dom and e2 in the oxic anoxic interfaces and photic aphotic zones in the water column the present findings have specific implications for the biogeochemical cycle and risk assessment of this pollutant in real aquatic environments declaration of

15160,the occurrence and fate of 17β estradiol e2 in natural water have gained extensive attention owing to its high ecotoxic risk to wildlife dissolved organic matter dom is a ubiquitous water constituent and contributes significantly to e2 removal although the reaction mechanism is rarely clarified the present study aims to investigate e2 transformation in water containing fresh or aged dom surrogates at environmentally relevant concentrations in the dark experiments along with radical probes of benzene and furfuryl alcohol reveal that reactive radicals particularly hydroxyl radical oh formed non photochemically at higher concentrations in aged dom than in fresh dom the contribution of oh in e2 removal is indicated by the decreases in the removal of radical probes in the presence of e2 moreover e2 removal is inhibited in the presence of radical scavengers the dose dependent inhibitive effect of substrate concentrations including e2 and coexistent propylparaben shows that the radical concentration is a limiting factor for e2 removal which could be enhanced by increasing dom concentration dissolved oxygen and light supply as the main byproduct estrone e1 is persistent in the current dom water in the dark but it can be easily photodegraded when exposed to light theoretical analysis reveals that the initial step is oh initiated h abstraction on the hydroxyl group in the cyclopentane ring of e2 the formed singlet excited state of e2 undergoes further intramolecular rearrangement and oxidative dehydrogenation to generate e1 and the hydroperoxy radical ho2 considering the universal occurrence of e2 in dom rich aquatic matrices the present findings have special implications for the biogeochemical cycle and risk assessment of this pollutant in natural aquatic environments particularly those beyond the photic zone graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reactive radicals steroid hormone humic acid h abstraction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction steroid hormone 17β estradiol e2 one of the most bioactive chemicals from in vivo steroidogenesis in mammals has specific estrogenic activity in maintaining normal growth development and reproduction in the body fortune 1994 in addition to its biogenic sources e2 is applied as drugs for the treatment of estrogenic deficiencies with doses of 1 2 mg orally once a day or external use or as an injection https www drugs com estradiol html this steroid hormone enters the aquatic system mainly through municipal wastewater effluent runoff from animal feeding operations and land applied manure patel et al 2019 e2 is of particular concern owing to its frequent detection in environmental water at concentrations of nanograms to micrograms per liter which can induce endocrine disruption in wildlife mills and chichester 2005 tiedeken et al 2017 according to e2 toxicity data based on priority indices the presence of this hormone at the detected concentrations poses a high risk to the most sensitive aquatic organisms liu et al 2020 the occurrence and risk of e2 are controlled by the natural attenuation in the aquatic environments which has recently gained extensive attention particularly our previous work on the contribution of biotic and abiotic processes shows that e2 removal is controlled mainly by the abiotic transformation of estuarine dissolved matter present in the water column yang et al 2016 dissolved organic matter dom which is composed of thousands of degradation byproducts as well as freshly produced compounds is a central component of biogeochemical cycles in aquatic ecosystems kellerman et al 2015 phytoplankton and bacteria release highly variable fractions of primary production into seawater as fresh dom jiao et al 2010 the amount of which can be substantial humic acid ha forms through the degradation of these microbial and plant precursors and represents a significant fraction of dom in aquatic environments klupfel et al 2014 ohno 2002 as an important constituent in natural water matrices dom is a key factor influencing the fate and toxicity of e2 increased concentrations of dom including ha can accelerate e2 sorption onto the sediment sun et al 2007 accelerate e2 photodegradation in water leech et al 2009 zhang et al 2007 affect microbial biodegradation of e2 gu et al 2016 inhibit laccase enabled e2 oxidation and oligomerization li and sun 2022 liu et al 2021 and decrease the estrogenicity of e2 in aquatic environments lee et al 2011 in addition dom exhibits a well known direct binding or coupling interaction with e2 through π π electron donor acceptor interaction and hydrogen bonding ma and yates 2018 the binding of estrogens to ha occurs most likely at the aromatic ring containing the hydroxyl group bedard et al 2014 yamamoto et al 2003 dom particularly that containing ha is composed of heterogeneous organic macromolecules that accept and donate electrons in many biogeochemical redox reactions at oxic anoxic interfaces kappler et al 2004 characterized by its primary light absorbing chromophores chromophoric dom cdom can photochemically generate highly reactive intermediates e g organic radicals and reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen 1o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and superoxide o2 aiken et al 2011 cdom can also be excited by the absorption of a photon to form excited singlet and triplet states of cdom 1cdom and 3cdom respectively mcneill and canonica 2016 in addition ha forms humic metal complexes and can be reduced in anoxic systems owing to its redox active functional groups e g quinones lovley et al 1996 reactive oh is formed non photochemically in the dark through a fenton type mechanism in the presence of molecular oxygen o2 reduced ha and complexed iron page et al 2012 such processes are intriguing because they do not require sunlight and involve the aeration of anoxic water thus research is frequently conducted on the dark production of oh by aeration of anoxic water and sediment minella et al 2015 page et al 2013 tong et al 2016 these reactive species might induce electron transfer with organic compounds and promote their degradation indirectly although the radical mediated degradation of e2 in dom water is rarely reported in the literature reactive radicals are the main contributors to e2 removal during ultraviolet uv photolysis and advanced oxidation processes aops gabet et al 2021 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 zhang and li 2014 direct or indirect photodegradation of e2 in dom water has been widely reported leech et al 2009 mazellier et al 2008 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2021 however little is known about its removal in the dark aside from that the dark aphotic zone constitutes most water bodies in the aquatic ecosystems because of the light attenuation and during the diurnal cycle at night therefore e2 is expected to react with dom in the dark either through the direct binding or indirect degradation mediated by reactive radicals in addition the transformation of propylparaben to methylparaben mediated by oh in the presence of dom surrogates in the dark has been confirmed he et al 2021 however the underlying reaction mechanism contributing to the previously observed e2 removal by estuarine dissolved matter yang et al 2016 remains unknown to supplement the related knowledge based on the combination of experimental investigation with theoretical calculation the present study tends to investigate e2 transformation in water with the presence of fresh or aged dom surrogates as well as clarify the specific role of reactive radicals and the effects of varied water parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents ha cas 1415 93 6 purity

preparation and characterization of dom surrogates followed the processes described in our previous work he et al 2021 in brief the cell lysis of the universal species of green microalga selenastrum capricornutum sc and coliform bacterium escherichia coli ec were selected as fresh organic matter oms to avoid the ionic effect of the culture medium on subsequent tests the microbial cells of sc and ec were first gathered through centrifugation dissolved solutions of sc and ec were obtained by repeated freeze thaw cycles ultrasonication and centrifugation dissolved ha considered as aged oms was obtained through a thermostatic process using 0 1 m naoh in a water bath these dom surrogates were further filtered using a glass fiber gf f φ 0 45 μm whatman international ltd maidstone england and the filtrate was submitted for dom characterization and the determination of total organic carbon toc concentration using toc analyzer aurora 1030 oi analytical texas united states as described in he et al 2021 ha has the most extended aromatic ring network c n ratio 78 7 and e465 e665 3 7 while sc and ec feature more aliphatic characteristics c n ratio and e465 e665 at comparable levels of 3 5 9 7 and 1 5 2 1 respectively fourier transform infrared spectra ftir indicated that these dom surrogates share similar active functional groups including aromatic carbonyl aliphatic and amide groups and the ha structure is more complicated than that of ec or sc to ensure aseptic conditions all vessels and mediums were sterilized in an autoclave at 121 c for 25 min prior to use further a fluorescence microscope dm 5000b leica microsystems wetzlar german was used for fluorescence stained with 40 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi st louis missouri united states to confirm that the obtained dom surrogates were axenic according to the apparent absence of bacteria porter and feig 1980 2 3 batch tests of e2 removal and radical analysis for the different analyses three experimental series were set up under the following conditions 1 e2 analysis e2 at a nominal concentration of 100 μg l 1 spiked in various types of dom water 2 radical analysis radical probe of either ben or ffa at a concentration of 100 μm was spiked in various types of dom water and 3 combined e2 and radical analysis both e2 at 100 μg l 1 and radical probe at 100 μm spiked in various types of dom water pure water pw as well as various dom water group were spiked with dissolved ha ec or sc at consistent concentration because the dom concentrations ranged widely from several to dozens of milligrams of carbon per liter in most water bodies evans et al 2005 minella et al 2015 the median concentration of 3 mg c l 1 was applied in the present work these experiment setups were prepared in triplicate with a working volume of 150 ml and were incubated statically at 25 1 c in the dark a multiparameter water analyzer ysi xylem inc yellow springs ohio united states was used to intermittently analyze the dissolved oxygen content which fluctuated at 7 36 0 41 mg l 1 at a ph range of 7 0 7 5 on days 0 1 3 7 14 and 21 accurate 5 ml samples of the water were filtrated and submitted for the further analysis of e2 and or radical probe 2 4 effects of variable factors on e2 removal in ha water the experimental setups of the variable factors in e2 removal were also prepared in triplicate but for only ha to evaluate the following effects 1 effect of radical scavenger specific scavengers of tba at a series of 0 5 50 and 500 mg l 1 or nan3 at a series of 0 10 100 and 1000 mg l 1 were spiked into the ha this high concentration of radical scavenger was added in excess to ensure total suppression of the radical reaction and is comparable to the applied concentrations in the literature al housari et al 2010 he et al 2021 silva et al 2016 2 effect of substrate concentration the effect of substrate concentration was evaluated considering two aspects different e2 concentrations at 10 50 and 100 μg l 1 and the presence of co existent pp at concentration of 0 10 100 and 1000 μg l 1 respectively this high concentration is based on the possibility of 1000 μg pharmaceutical e2 tablets being accidentally discarded into the water body yang et al 2016 3 effect of ha concentration ha was spiked with a concentration of 0 0 3 3 or 30 mg c l 1 on the basis of the above mentioned doc concentration range in actual water as discussed previously evans et al 2005 minella et al 2015 4 effect of do concentration in addition to the above group without further treatment which is considered to be an oxygen rich group an oxygen poor group was created by purging the oxygen by nitrogen aeration for 30 min the oxygen saturated group was treated by aeration with an air pump for 60 min the do concentrations detected in the oxygen poor and saturated groups were 0 85 0 18 and 8 10 0 26 mg o l 1 respectively 5 effect of light intensity light intensities at 0 2000 and 4000 lux were evaluated using cool white fluorescent lamps λ 310 750 nm in an incubator unless otherwise noted the conditions in each series of tests were set up with e2 at 100 μg l 1 ha at 3 mg c l 1 and do at 7 36 0 41 mg o l 1 which was incubated statically in 100 ml serum bottles at 25 1 c in the dark 2 5 analysis of e2 removal and e1 formation following the addition of e1 d4 as the internal standard

decreased by 0 14 0 08 0 07 and 0 02 μm in the ha ec sc pw respectively correspondingly the k b e n value in the group with e2 decreased by 31 4 50 5 among the dom waters including pw compared with that in the group without e2 the lost amount or removal rate constant k f f a of ffa in the group with e2 decreased slightly by 1 5 μm 15 3 in the ha and 3 5 μm 26 9 in the sc but increased by 3 3 μm

observed in the water spiked with dom surrogates fig s3a d the r e 2 21 value was highest at 91 1 in the ha followed by 54 8 and 25 1 in the sc and ec respectively the e2 removal in the various dom

increased the k e 2 value in the pw by 178 9 or 131 6 respectively the e2 removal showed good negative correlation with both phenol formation and ffa loss with the pearson s r of 0 677 adj r2 0 454

lost amount of the summed concentration of e2 and its main byproduct e1 r e 2 e 1 21 indicated further removal of e1 as shown in fig s5a d the r e 2 e 1 21 value was consistently 10 8 14 7 in all ha groups which is slightly higher than those ranging from 1 0 to 5 6 in the pw sc and ec additionally ffa and ben had insignificant effects on further e1 removal the e2 removal was linearly well fitted

nan3 addition on e2 removal and e1 formation were relatively complex showing enhanced effects at 10 and 100 mg l 1 but inhibitive effects at 1000 mg l 1 figs 2b s6c and d the k e 2 value 10 7 s 1 increased from 4 35 in the nan3 non spiked group to 5 62 and 18 25 in the groups of 10 and 100 mg l 1 nan3 respectively this was accompanied by increases in the r e 2 21 value from 65 0 to 73 5 and 95 8 respectively however a higher concentration of 1000 mg l 1 nan3 addition inhibited e2 removal completely which was accompanied by decreases in the k e 2 and r e 2 21 values to 0 04 10 7 s 1 and 3 2 respectively further the r e 2 e 1 21 value was maintained at lower levels of 2 4 11 0 in all groups with and without the addition of nan3 3 5 effects of substrate concentration the increase in e2 concentration had a negative effect on e2 removal and e1 formation figs 3 a s7a and b when the e2 concentration decreased from 100 μg l 1 to 50 and 10 μg l 1 the k e 2 value increased by 72 9 and 146

value of 7 18 0 53 10 9 μg 1 l s 1 pearson s r 0 997 adj r2 0 989 however the final r e 2 e 1 21 value was maintained at less than 10 0 in all the groups within different e2 concentrations further the co existence of pp exhibited an inhibitive effect on e2 removal and e1 formation in a concentration dependent manner fig s7c and d compared with the value of 12 03 in the pp non spiked group the k e 2 value 10 7 s 1 decreased to 11 28 6 86 and 4 70 in the pp spiked group of 10 100 and 1000 μg l 1 respectively fig 3 b simultaneously the r e 2 21 value decreased from 87 1 to 83 7 70 3 and 56 1 respectively the calculated negative effect of co existent pp on the e2 removal was 6 39 1 38 10 10 μg 1 l s 1 with pearson s r of 0 956 and adj r² of 0 872 the r e 2 e 1 21 value was maintained at a lower level of 6 4 12 2 regardless of the variation in co existent pp concentration 3 6 effects of environmental factors the effect of increased ha concentrations on e2 removal and e1 formation exhibited a dose dependent positive manner figs 4 a s6a and b compared with the value of 4 35 in 3 mg c l 1 the k e 2 value 10 7 s 1 decreased to 1 08 in 0 3 mg c l 1 but increased to 10 12 in 30 mg c l 1 simultaneously the r e 2 21 value decreased from 65 0 in 3 mgc l 1 to 17 5 in 0 3 mg c l 1 but increased to 80 6 in 30 mg c l 1 based on the spiked concentration the calculated effect of ha on the rate constant of e2 removal was positive at 3 09 0 57 10 8 mg 1 l s 1 with pearson s r of 0 967 and adj r² at 0 903 the r e 2 e 1 21 value was maintained at 2 4 8 9 in all the groups regardless of the varied ha concentration the k e 2 values 10 7 s 1 were at 6 07 and 2 33 in the oxygen rich and oxygen poor water but increased remarkably to 14 22 in the oxygen saturated water fig 4b correspondingly the r e 2 21 values were 63 0 in the oxygen rich water 30 4 in the oxygen poor water and 92 1 in the oxygen saturated water on the basis of the detected do concentration the calculated effect of do on e2 removal was positive at 6 37 2 67 10 8 mg 1 l s 1 with pearson s r of 0 922 and adj r² of 0 701 the r e 2 e 1 21 value was maintained at 5 2 12 1 in all groups regardless of the variation in do concentration the k e 2 value 10 7 s 1 increased dramatically from 6 07 to 11 35 and 16 95 when the light intensity increased from 0 to 2000 and 4000 lux amounting to 86 9 and 178 7 increases respectively fig 4c correspondingly the r e 2 21 value increased from 63 0 to 86 0 and 94 9 respectively on the basis of the applied light intensity the calculated positive effect of light on e2 removal was almost linear at 2 73 0 05 10 10 lux 1 s 1 with pearson s r of 1 000 and adj r² of 0 999 along with the e2 removal the formed e1 accumulated gradually to similar peak concentrations of 52 7 54 7 μg l 1 fig s6f however the peak time differed among these groups at 21 14 and 7 days in the groups of 0 2000 lux and 4000 lux respectively further the formed e1 decreased dramatically from the peak concentration to 29 6 and 10 4 µg l 1 in the groups of 2000 lux and 4000 lux on day 21 respectively correspondingly the r e 2 e 1 21 value increased from 7 0 in the 0 lux group to 55 2 and 84 2 in the 2000 and 4000 lux groups respectively these observations indicate that the byproduct e1 underwent further removal in the presence of light 3 7 quantum chemical calculation degradation of e2 mediated by oh was theorically calculated at the b3lyp 6 311g d p m06 2x def2 tzvp level the reaction route corresponding intermediate im and transitional ts products gibbs free energy change energy barrier and second rate constant are shown in fig 5 detailed gibbs free energies for all molecules are presented in table s1 when attacked by oh e2 can undergo hydrogen abstraction to form the im1 radical and h2o followed by rapid transformation to im2 in the presence of ground state oxygen dissolved in water intramolecular rearrangement would likely occur in the newly formed intermediate product of im2 causing deoxygenation and dehydrogenation from which e1 and the hydroperoxy radical ho2 are generated the calculated free gibbs energy change of reaction δg for these three processes was 110 61 120 90 and 72 56 kj mol 1 respectively proving that the formations of im1 im2 and e1 were thermodynamically favored the calculated energy barrier δg of the formation of im1 and e1 was 29 33 and 58 71 kj mol 1 respectively through which the second order rate constant k was calculated as 4 49 107 and 3 22 102 m 1 s 1 respectively because the ground state oxygen is a triplet state which could be considered a biradical system and therefore could induce barrierless addition to radicals no energy barrier is present in the transformation from im1 to im2 this result could indicate that the formation of e1 from im2 is a rate determining step in the present reaction 4 discussion significant amounts of phenol formation and ffa loss were detected in the dom spiked water and showed a positive correlation ben undergoes a fast reaction with oh to form phenol at a rate constant of 7 8 109 m 1 s 1 95 yield al housari et al 2010 vione et al 2006 ffa is easily oxidized by ros of both oh and 1o2 at rate constants of 1 5 10 10 and 1 2 10 8 m 1 s 1 respectively brame et al 2014 buxton et al 1988 ffa can also be removed by 3cdom or other species as reported in the literature al housari et al 2010 thus the concentration of phenol formed from ben indicates the specific cumulated oh concentration whereas the ffa loss indicates the sum of the contributions of oh 1o2 and 3cdom or other ros radicals these results imply that ros particularly oh were produced in dom water in the dark comparable oh levels were also observed by aeration of anoxic lake water in the dark using terephthalic acid as the probe reaction minella et al 2015 page et al 2012 dom appeared to be the main source for oh over most oceans mopper and zhou 1990 these dom surrogates are redox active organic macromolecules containing active functional moieties i e semiquinones and hydroquinones and complexed iron kappler et al 2004 lovley et al 1996 they are reduced in anoxic water thus the interaction of reduced dom with dissolved oxygen might non photochemically generate reactive oh through a fenton type mechanism even in the dark gligorovski et al 2015 page et al 2012 xiao et al 2020 compared with the fresh oms the aged ha exhibited higher aromaticity and more unsaturated bonds he et al 2021 which contributed to the higher ros production in ha relative to that in the ec and sc the presence of e2 substantially reduced the rate constant of phenol formation in all dom water types including the pw and ffa loss in the sc conversely the presence of ffa or ben substantially reduced the rate constant of e2 removal substantially in nearly all dom water types an exception is the ec in which the rate constant was reduced only by ffa the higher concentrations of tba 50 and 500 mg l 1 which is a specific scavenger for quenching oh al housari et al 2010 inhibited e2 removal a specific scavenger of higher nan3 concentration 1000 mg l 1 which can quench oh at a second order rate constant of 1 4 1010 m 1 s 1 al housari et al 2010 silva et al 2016 also inhibited e2 removal these inhibitive effects indicate competitive reactions of ros particularly oh which contributed significantly to e2 removal this conclusion is supported by the linear correlation of e2 removal kinetics with the concentrations of ffa loss or phenol formation in all dom groups this indicateds that oh in aquatic environments is the most reactive oxidant that can degrade chemicals nonselectively through photochemistry as well as in aops for example liu et al 2017 reported that oh is predominantly responsible for the indirect photodegradation of e2 the oh involvement in the indirect photo transformation of e2 has been widely reported in fenton and uv driven aops rosenfeldt and linden 2004 the results also showed enhanced e2 removal in the presence of lower nan3 concentrations 10 and 100 mg l 1 which might be attributed to the reaction of e2 with appropriate concentrations of azide radical n3 formed from the azide anion in the presence of oxygen he et al 2021 silva et al 2016 these results indicate that in addition to oh other ros radicals might contribute to the removal of e2 and ffa in water for example carbon centered radicals r c produced from the uv peracetic acid process have been recognized as predominant contributors to the degradation of e2 hu et al 2022 moreover a single electron to generate phenoxyl radicals of e2 and then the oligomerization products mediated by mn iii in the presence of ha under visible light irradiation has also been reported wang et al 2018 notably the presence of e2 in the pw enhanced ffa loss and the presence of ffa or ben in the pw enhanced thee2 removal a low concentration of 5 mg l 1 tba enhanced e2 removal in the ha water a similar result has been reported by wang et al 2020 such that a phenolic acid compound promoted on the photo removal of e2 from water under simulated sunlight irradiation additional supporting evidence has been reported for other chemicals such as significant enhancement of trichloroethylene degradation by adding a small amount of methane chang and criddle 1997 and increased enzymatic removal of refractory sulfamethoxazole in the presence of co existent sulfonamides yang et al 2018 these enhanced effects referred to as co metabolism indicate that one co existent chemical can act as an electron shuttle mediator for the removal of another chemical nguyen et al 2021 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2018 further enhanced removal of both ffa and e2 in the presence of another chemical was observed in the ec but not in the ha and sc this indicates that specific components existing in the ec might favor the removal process of these two chemicals our previous ftir analysis showed that compared to the ha and sc the ec exhibited a unique absorbance band at the wave number of 2854 cm 1 corresponding to the functional group of ch2 symmetric stretching vibration he et al 2021 however because the related information is limited in depth research should be conducted in the future the acid dissociation constant pka value for e2 has been reported as 10 23 10 4 neale et al 2009 westerhoff et al 2005 which indicates that the e2 is not ionized and hydrolyzed at the experimental ph value of 7 0 in the present work the decay rate constant k 1 60 14 26 10 7 s 1 and removal percentage r e 2 21 25 1 91 1 for e2 was higher in the ha than in the sc and ec the t1 2 was at 4 7 105 s equivalent to 5 5d in the ha which is shorter than that in ec and sc at 50 16 days respectively the observed value of e2 removal in the present study is comparable to the reported e2 biodegradation by quinone reducing bacteria with rate constants of 1 59 3 18 10 3 h 1 and t1 2 at 217 97 435 94 h gu et al 2016 moreover microorganisms in river water samples are capable of transforming e2 to e1 with half lives of 0 2 9 days jurgens et al 2002 further a decay constant of 0 33 d 1 and a t1 2 value of 3 12 days have been reported for the natural attenuation of e2 in a simulated estuary water system yang et al 2016 however the moderate removal rate of e2 in water in the present study is far lower than those in manual reinforcement processes such as photocatalysis and aop for example the rate constant of e2 in photolytic removal is 0 05 h 1 at a constant irradiance of 11 040 µmol m 2 650 w m2 leech et al 2009 the dose dependent inhibitive effect of substrate concentrations e2 and coexistent pp revealed ros concentration to being a limiting factor for e2 removal the e2 reacts rapidly with the oh at a second order rate constant of 0 53 1 41 1010 m 1 s 1 as determined by the competitive kinetics method or theoretical calculation rosenfeldt and linden 2004 zhao et al 2010 as the main contributor of e2 removal the cumulated oh concentration on day 21 was 0 23 μm in the ha water with a slow production rate whereas the corresponding e2 concentrations were at 0 037 0 184 and 0 367 μm in groups of 10 50 and 100 μg l 1 respectively according to the molar mass balance the oh production limited e2 removal thus it could be expected that the quantum yield of e2 removal is identical in these groups and a lower substrate concentration leads to a higher removal rate because oh contributing to pp removal he et al 2021 the competitive oh consumption by higher concentrations of co existent pp might have led to the reduced e2 removal moreover the ros production correlated with the aromaticity of the doms and the higher oh production leads to the higher removal of e2 in the ha than the ec and sc these observations are similar to the reported pp degradation mediated by oh in dom water he et al 2021 although numerous studies have shown that the binding of e2 to the dom surrogate occurs at the aromatic ring of e2 bedard et al 2014 yamamoto and liljestrand 2003 yamamoto et al 2003 or dom gu et al 2016 the well fitted linear relationship between e1 formation and e2 loss confirmed that e1 is the main byproduct of e2 in the present dom water along with the removal of e2 e1 is widely observed as the main byproduct or immediate product in an oxidation process by soil manganese oxides sheng et al 2009 biodegradation by bacteria li et al 2012 zhang et al 2022 enzymatic catalyzed reactions in the presence of ha li et al 2017 sun et al 2016 ε mno2 nanorods in ha solution sun et al 2020 heterogeneous photo fenton reaction zhao et al 2008 photo removal under simulated sunlight irradiation wang et al 2020 and the natural transformation product in simulated aquatic systems jurgens et al 2002 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 notably this observed product is different from the formation of aliphatic and hydroxylated byproducts in aops perondi et al 2020 or the self cross oligomeric products between e2 and model dom constituents li and sun 2022 compared to the corresponding parent e2 the estrogenic activity of e1 is relatively lower zhao et al 2008 this finding has implications for the self purification ability of natural ecosystem and the development of pollution control techniques in addition the r e 2 e 1 21 was maintained at relatively low values of 15 in nearly all treatments in the dark but increased to 55 2 and 84 2 when the light intensity increased to 2000 and 4000 lux respectively these observations indicate that e1 was persistent and could not be degraded in the current dom water in the dark but could be easily photodegraded when exposed to light rokhina and suri 2012 also indicated that e1 is more persistent to chemical oxidation because its computed stability index is significantly lower than that of e2 by theoretical analysis direct photolysis of e1 other than e2 in aqueous solutions has been shown to occur under irradiation using a high pressure mercury lamp λ 365 nm 125 w liu and liu 2004 this result is in line with the wavelength range of 310 750 nm applied in the present work one to three additional hydroxylations located on the aromatic ring of the parent e1 were reported as the main byproducts induced by photodegradation processes souissi et al 2012 photodegradation of e1 under simulated sunlight can be enhanced by the presence of 7 7 8 9 mg l 1 of dissolved organic carbon caupos et al 2011 e2 and its byproduct e1 share the same molecular framework which is composed of four rings a phenol ring two cyclohexane rings and a cyclopentane ring rokhina and suri 2012 the major configuration difference between the two chemicals is the cyclopentane ring at position c17 which has a hydroxyl group in e2 and a carbonyl group in e1 this indicates that the initial attack site of ros on e2 is the hydroxyl group in the cyclopentane ring rokhina and suri 2012 pointed out that in addition to the carbon atoms in the phenol ring the oxygen atoms of the carbonyl groups carbon and oxygen atoms in the cyclopentane ring can be attacked by oh as indicated by their high fukui functions moreover wang et al 2018 also found the higher charge densities 0 409 localized at the oxygen atoms of the carbonyl groups in the cyclopentane ring of e2 molecule have the greatest potential to be reaction sites in the present study the oh mediated e2 transformation to e1 was computerized by theoretical calculation e2 underwent h abstraction by oh attack at position c17 of the cyclopentane ring to form the im1 radical which can transform into im2 rapidly in the presence of dissolved ground state oxygen im2 underwent intramolecular rearrangement and oxidative dehydrogenation to generate e1 and the radical of ho2 the reactive species of ho2 might be a reason for the above observation e2 enhancing the ffa removal in the ec notably our result is slightly different from the theoretical proposition that the oh attack of carbon atoms at the aromatic ring of e2 with the subsequent formation of dihydroxy photoproducts and quinone like products rokhina and suri 2012 furthermore wang et al 2018 proposed that the o 19 of the e2 molecule might undergo the loss of one electron mediated by mn iii to form a radical intermediate and be subsequently oxidized to e1 it could be noted that the intermediate products of im1 and im2 deserve to be identified through high resolution mass spectrum analysis in the future the environmental factors favorable for ros formation and the reaction process can significantly enhance e2 removal as an important substrate the increase in ha concentration increased e2 removal in a dose dependent matter which is slightly different from the effect of ha on pp removal he et al 2021 this difference might be attributed to the fact that e2 can be removed not only by oh but also by other ros radicals or mediators whereas pp is removed only by oh do was found to be another substrate for ros formation in dom water the dioxygen dependent pathway for oh production has also been reported such that the apparent oh quantum yield in surface waters under aerobic conditions is significantly higher than that obtained anaerobically vaughan and blough 1998 molecular oxygen is also shown to be an important substrate for the formation of im2 from im1 by theoretical calculation thus a sufficient oxygen supply might accelerate the reaction process and enhance e2 removal because the light source provides energy gligorovski et al 2015 sun et al 2015 it is reasonable to predict that the processes of oh formation by interacting of dom and do can be enhanced significantly through light adsorption further because byproduct e1 can be easily photodegraded the lower concentration of accumulated e1 might accelerate the removal of parent e2 5 conclusion according to the concentration difference in radical probes accompanied by e2 removal oh is the most important contributor to e2 removal in dom water in the dark however other radicals and mediators might also exist and contribute to e2 removal compared with fresh doms aged dom matrices are more favorable for oh production and thus e2 removal e1 is the main byproduct from e2 removal and rather persistent in the present dom water in the dark but can easily be photodegraded when exposed to light considering the configuration difference the oh initiated h abstraction on the hydroxyl group in the cyclopentane ring of e2 was proposed to be the main reaction mechanism the increases in ha do and light intensity were favorable for the transformation process of e2 to e1 which provides operational implications for in situ pollution control considering the universal occurrence of dom and e2 in the oxic anoxic interfaces and photic aphotic zones in the water column the present findings have specific implications for the biogeochemical cycle and risk assessment of this pollutant in real aquatic environments declaration of

decreases effluent total nitrogen tn analysis of don fluorescent components and molecular characteristics indicated that suddenly shifting the environment from anoxic condition to aerobic condition in the intermittent aeration cw iacw would stimulate microorganisms to release tryptophan and simple aromatic proteins like substances which does not occur in the limited continuous aeration cw cacw consequently the abundance of don resembling lipids proteins amino sugars and carbohydrates like molecules in iacw were about 2 1 times higher than that in cacw bioassay results showed that selenastrum capricornutum and microcystis aeruginosa incubated with effluent from iacw both generate larger phytoplankton biomass than that with cacw effluent even though iacw effluent contains less tn than its counterpart moreover microcystis aeruginosa can simultaneously utilize don and din while selenastrum capricornutum seem to utilize the don only when din was not available this result implies that increasing don discharge may also influence phytoplankton composition and stimulate harmful phytoplankton species overall this study indicates that upgrading cw solely depending on din removal level cannot ensure a mitigation of nitrogen related eutrophication and more efforts should be paid to curb don discharge graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic

resource management ho et al 2019 yao et al 2018 reducing nitrogen n loading is a primary management strategy to mitigate eutrophication conley et al 2009 given the practical advantages of ecological benefits and cost effectiveness constructed wetlands cws are widely used for nitrogen removal in economically developing areas and as tertiary nitrogen removal in existing wastewater treatment plants wwtps wang et al 2019 to meet the requirement of the more and more stringent total nitrogen tn discharge permit several types of aeration cws were invented in the last three decades e g artificial aeration effluent recirculation and tidal flow cws ilyas and masih 2017 although the effluent tn has decreased substantially in these aeration cws regulatory efforts have only focused on reducing dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and disregarding the dissolved organic nitrogen don don is an inevitable nitrogen component in the final effluents of wastewater treatment systems effluent don can cause a variety of problems including nitrogenous disinfection byproducts generating coloration and odor of water chu et al 2011 liao et al 2022 more importantly recent studies have shown that several components of the don pool are bioavailable abdon to phytoplankton and bacteria and are dynamic actors in aquatic ecosystems paul et al 2010 for instance in haizhou bay don has been proven to be a major source of nitrogen for phytoplankton zhang et al 2022 yet the possible effects of effluent don on eutrophication have been neglected in most studies this is mainly because don used to comprise a small fraction of effluent nitrogen however with recent advanced nitrogen treatment technologies most din can be efficiently removed and don becomes a non negligible even dominant component approximately 25 95 of residual nitrogen in the final effluent eom et al 2017 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2006 therefore understanding the characteristics of effluent don in wastewater treatment systems with high din removal efficiency has drawn a growing body of attention recently previous researches suggest that reducing din in the effluent cannot ensure a reduction in don or its bioavailability and the merit of removing din via upgrading wastewater treatment systems might be potentially offset by producing a small amount yet highly bioavailable don bronk et al 2007 he et al 2018 for instance a relative work of post denitrification biofilter system found that increasing the influent cod n ratio could greatly reduce the effluent din concentration but could not decrease the don concentration in the effluent hu et al 2018a similarly hu et al 2018b found that prolonging sludge retention time srt in the activated sludge system could enhance tn removal but can not sequester the abdon and occasionally contributed to greater amounts of abdon in effluents additionally a previous study reported that accelerating eutrophication and hypoxia continue to occur in the long island sound area even after a significant decrease of nitrogen loads with upgrades of wwtps from conventional activated sludge systems to predenitrification biological nutrient removal systems suter et al 2014 one possible explanation for this phenomenon is that predenitrification is prone to the production of low molecular weight don which can produce nearly 10 times more chlorophyll a chl a than din on a per mg n basis eom et al 2017 the unrelated removal performance of din and don urge the nutrient removal field of cws to move forward in answering the most practical and vital question regarding the nitrogen removal whether upgrading conventional cws to intensified cws would introduce more don or abdon in the final effluent consequently whether improving din removal efficiency via upgrading cws with high capital and operational costs could really alleviate eutrophication in receiving waters to address these questions two typical aeration cws an intermittent aeration cw and a limited continuous aeration cw were chosen as model systems the reasons for choosing these two types of cws are as follows 1 because of efficient nitrogen removal performance both intermittent aeration cw iacw and limited continuous aeration cw cacw have been widely applied in removing nitrogen from various wastewater 2 it has been well documented that aeration strategy plays an important role in controlling din removal in cws moreover recent studies found that the aeration strategy also could affect the removal of nitrogenous organic micropollutants and the production of soluble microbial products smps capodici et al 2015 which are both important fractions of don hu et al 2020a thus it is expected that the artificial aeration would not only affect the din removal but also don removal in cws 3 from practical perspectives the chemical fraction of effluent don varied depending on the influent sources cannot be easily controllable however the microbially derived don produced during the treatment process could be regulated by adjusting the operation condition therefore understanding the role of aeration strategy on the performance of don removal will assist in the proper design and operation of cws the objectives of this study were to investigate whether and how artificial aeration affects effluent don concentration chemical composition and bioavailability in cws to determine the major environmental factors affecting the characteristics of effluent don and to access the potential ecological risks of effluent don with respect to eutrophication 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the lab scale wetland two parallel lab scale vertical flow cws were constructed with pvc column height 120 cm diameter 20 cm in the greenhouse with temperature controlled at 24 3 the cw bed contained a 10 cm supporting layer filled with gravel with a diameter ranging from 2 to 3 cm followed by an 80 cm treatment layer filled with gravel with a diameter ranging from 0 8 to 1 cm fig 1 in the middle of cw bed a vertical perforated pvc pipe diameter 3 cm was pre buried for monitoring the parameters temperature do and ph in situ with a ysi pro professional plus usa air was supplied from a diffuser placed on the support layer and the aeration rate was controlled by an airflow meter the initial working volume was 8 79 l for each cw to minimize the effects of fluctuations in plant growth on don removal performance iris pseudacorus with a strong adaptation to the environment and strong stress resistance was selected and planted in cw jia et al 2018 li et al 2021 the density of iris pseudacorus was 50 plants m2 the influent raw wastewater was collected from an on campus septic tank effluent in the huazhong agricultural university wuhan china the raw wastewater was firstly pumped into an intermediate tank 1 m3 and set for one week before being pumped into the cws the water table was kept 3 cm below the substrate surface a summary of influent characteristics is shown in table s1 and fig s1 the hydraulic retention time hrt of the cw was fixed at 12 h 2 2 process operation and samples collection the overall experiment was divided into the start up period 60 days and operation period 135 days during the start up period both cws were operated under continuous aeration with a do concentration of 0 6 1 2 mg l by adjusting the aeration flow rate to facilitate the development of microbes and plants after the effluent tn and din became stable two strategies were executed in cws as previously done by fan et al 2013 intermittent aeration with an airflow rate of 400 ml min for 1 h do concentration of 3 0 5 0 mg l and non aeration for 4 5 h was applied in one cw termed as iacw meanwhile the other cw was maintained as limited continuous aeration termed as cacw with an airflow flow rate of 60 ml min do concentration of 0 6 1 2 mg l the system was then maintained at the same operational conditions for about two weeks to verify and ensure the effluent tn and din became stable during the operation period water samples of influent and effluent were collected twice per week for analyzing nh 4 n no 2 n no 3 n and total dissolved nitrogen tdn to investigate the effect of the aeration mode on don removal characteristics five don samples were used for don bioavailability determination and don molecular composition analysis to investigate the influence of aeration modes on don removal high time resolutions within the cycle study were conducted on days 57 89 and 123 respectively during each within cycle study water samples were collected over time during the whole operation period to investigate the change of nh 4 n no 2 n no 3 n tdn and fluorescent components in detail water samples were collected every 30 min during the aerobic stage and every 90 min during the anoxic stage for iacw and the sampling frequencies of cacw were the same as those of iacw 2 3 bioassay a total of three sets of bioassays were performed on effluents from iacw and cacw day 40 82 and 115 each bioassays test was performed in triplicates selenastrum capricornutum s capricornutum and microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa were chosen as the algal species for the bioassay studies because they have been widely used as standard test organisms for eutrophication pehlivanoglu and sedlak 2004 halling sùrensen 2000 and m aeruginosa is also the most common bloom forming phytoplankton species in freshwater eutrophic lakes stone 2011 the algal species used in this study were obtained from the center of culture collection of algae at the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences on the starting day of each bioassay water samples were collected from the lake nanhu a typical freshwater eutrophic lake located in wuhan china these water samples were brought back to the laboratory within 1 h of collection 5 l of water was firstly filtered through a 0 7 μm glass fiber filter to remove particles and algae and then filtered through a 0 2 μm membrane filter the retentate on the 0 2 μm filter was resuspended in 50 ml of the 0 2 μm filtered water and used as the bacterial inoculum to start the bioassay 1 5 ml of n starved algal seeds 1 5 ml bacterial inoculum and 100 ml milli q water were added to 100 ml of filter sterilized effluents 0 2 μm membrane filter in a 500 ml erlenmeyer flask moreover to ensure all necessary nutrients except for nitrogen were adequate during the bioassay potassium phosphate k2hpo4 was added to the media to give an initial p concentration of 7 0 mg l the same as bg 11 culture medium and 2 ml of 100 bg 11 stock solution without nitrogen and phosphorus was also added to the media to supply the other necessary nutrition e g mg2 sulfur and carbon source each bioassay was incubated in triplicate at 25 1 with a 12 12 h light dark cycle in a photobioreactor the light intensity was kept at 2500 lux the sampling of biomass measured as chl a nitrogen and phosphorus p were conducted every 2 days 2 4 batch tests batch tests were conducted to explore the effect of do concentrations on don characteristics of cacw on the 136th day the do concentration of cacw was adjusted to 3 0 5 0 mg l and other operating parameters and environmental conditions were kept the same as before the tests were performed for 2 weeks during the batch tests water samples overtime during the whole operation period were collected in duplication to investigate the change of nh 4 n no 2 n no 3 n tdn and fluorescent components 2 5 analytical methods nh 4 n no 2 n no 3 n po 4 3 p tdn and chl a were analyzed using standard methods apha 2005 the don concentration was determined by the difference between tdn and din the abdon and bioavailability of don were determined with a 14 day algal growth bioassay hu et al 2020b the don molecular composition was analyzed according to hu et al 2018a details of the abdon measurement don bioavailability calculation and the don molecular composition analysis are provided in the supporting information the fluorescent components were measured using the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3deem in a fluorescent spectrophotometer f 4600 fl spectrophotometer hitachi japan during the scanning the excitation wavelength was set from 200 nm to 450 nm with 5 nm intervals while the emission wavelength was set from 250 nm to 600 nm with 5 nm intervals the excitation and emission slits were maintained at 5 nm and the scanning speed was set at 1200 nm min with a pmt voltage of 700 v to distinguish the removal selectivity of each fluorescent component under different operational conditions the don and fluorescent components were calculated as fllows 3 δ don don previous sampling time don present sampling time 4 δ fluorescent component fluorescent component previous sampling time fluorescent component present sampling time 2 6 statistical analysis student s t test and anova analysis were performed using the spss 19 0 package ibm armonk new york with a value of 0 05 or 0 01 selected for significance the parafac analysis was carried out in matlab r2018a mathworks usa the difference in don composition between cws was analyzed using permutation multivariate analysis of variance permanova based on pcoa bray curtis distances using r software r studio pbc boston ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall nitrogen removal performance 3 1 1 effluent tn and din of the cws effluent tn and different forms of din in two cws are presented in fig 2 the iacw showed a significantly higher tn removal efficiency 73 92 than the cacw 64 03 p 0 01 as reported tn removal in cws was mainly dependent on the coupled nitrification denitrification process wu et al 2016 as shown in fig 2a complete nh 4 n removal was achieved in both iacw and cacw in which effluent nh 4 n concentrations were all below 1 50 mg l and no no 2 n accumulation was observed in any of the cws 0 06 mg l these results were consistent with previous studies indicating artificial aeration is an effective way to establish complete nitrification in cws hou et al 2017 with effective nitrification no 3 n became a major part of the effluent din in both iacw and cacw however the effluent no 3 n concentration in iacw 11 82 mg l was significantly lower than that in cacw 16 94 mg l p 0 01 the result was in keeping with previous observational studies indicating continuous aeration could promote ammonium removal 98 78 but often resulted in nitrate accumulation in the effluent tang et al 2021 on the other hand intermittent aeration was a reliable way to enhance the tn removal performance of cws via developing alternated aerobic and anoxic conditions for nitrification and denitrification hu et al 2012 wu et al 2015 3 1 2 effluent don abdon and don bioavailability of the cws although iacw effluent contained much less effluent tn it contained 2 1 times as many effluent don as cacw as detailed in fig 2b the effluent don concentrations in iacw 1 93 mg l on average were always higher than that in cacw 0 90 mg l on average p 0 05 despite a high frequent change of influent don fig s1 moreover the effluent abdon in iacw 1 25 mg l was also significantly higher than that in cacw 0 32 mg l p 0 05 and there was a significant increase of don bioavailability abdon don in iacw p 0 05 fig s2 the significant increase in effluent abdon and don bioavailability implied that not only concentration but also the chemical composition of effluent don was different between iacw and cacw taken together the above results illustrated that an intermittent aeration strategy could lead to more don in the effluent of the cw particularly in the form of abdon although it greatly decreases tn by reducing din 3 2 molecular compositions of effluent don in the cws to gain insight into the impact of aeration strategies on the characteristics of effluent don in cws the molecular composition of effluent don was analyzed by fticr ms fig 3 despite the higher effluent concentration of don and abdon in iacw no significant difference was found in effluent don composition between iacw and cacw permanova s p 0 05 however if the data were analyzed separately for h c 1 5 regions and h c 1 5 regions the composition of molecules in h c 1 5 regions was significantly different between iacw and cacw permanova s p 0 05 especially only 38 57 of the identified don molecules in h c 1 5 regions were consistent in the effluent of iacw and cacw moreover the chemodiversity and relative abundance of molecules in h c 1 5 regions from iacw 247 formulae in diversity and 63 66 in relative abundance were both higher than that from cacw 141 formulae in diversity and 36 34 in relative abundance based on previous studies molecules in h c 1 5 regions are likely to be microbially derived don and are more bioavailable hu et al 2018b ohno et al 2014 thus the effluent don from iacw which is more lipids h c 1 7 2 2 o c 0 0 2 proteins amino sugars h c 1 5 2 2 o c 0 2 0 6 n c 0 05 and carbohydrates like h c 1 5 2 2 o c 0 6 1 in character is likely the reason why the highly bioavailable of effluent don was observed in the iacw to further distinguish the source of effluent don the differences in n containing molecular formulas between influent and effluent of iacw and between influent and effluent of cacw were analyzed don molecules were divided into recalcitrant consumed and produced parts respectively based on the venn diagram recalcitrant don is the don molecules that exist in the influent and remain in the effluent consumed don is the don molecules that exist in the influent but disappear in the effluent and the produced don is the molecules that appear only in the effluent there were no significant differences in recalcitrant and consumed don compositions between iacw and cacw permanova s p 0 05 however a significant difference in produced don composition was observed permanova s p 0 05 specifically over 80 of the identified consumed and recalcitrant don molecules were consistent between iacw and cacw while only 49 of produced don molecules were consistent between iacw and cacw moreover among the produced don iacw tended to generate more proteins amino sugars molecules 130 molecules in iacw and 58 molecules in cacw respectively carbohydrates molecules 52 molecules in iacw and 33 molecules in cacw respectively and lipids like molecules 11 molecules in iacw and 1 molecule in cacw respectively in contrast cacw tended to produce more unsaturated hydrocarbons 7 molecules in iacw and 20 molecules in cacw respectively condensed aromatics 54 molecules in cacw and 23 molecules in iacw respectively and tannins like 229 molecules in iacw and 265 molecules in cacw respectively nitrogenous substances taking the don molecule abundance into consideration the abundance of produced don in iacw was about 1 13 times higher than that in cacw and the abundance of produced don resembling lipids proteins amino sugars and carbohydrates in iacw was about 2 1 times higher than that in cacw in contrast there was no obvious difference in consumed and recalcitrant don between iacw and cacw in terms of abundance based on these results the high effluent don concentration and bioavailability observed in iacw were likely mainly contributed by the generation of microbially derived nitrogenous organics 3 3 variations in fluorescent components and don over the treatment process changes in fluorescent components during the whole operation process were monitored to better understand the cause of the greater amount of don especially abdon present in iacw effluents compared to cacw effluents four fluorescent components were identified from all the measured samples in the eem spectra based on previous studies c1 and c4 are likely from humic like compounds c2 is likely from tryptophan protein like compounds and c3 from simple aromatic protein like compounds hu et al 2020b komatsu et al 2020 tang et al 2020 xue et al 2017 fig s3 fig 4 shows the changes in don and fluorescent components over the operation period in the iacw don decreased rapidly from 8 61 mg l to 1 73 mg l during the first aerobic and anoxic stage fig 4a however during the second aerobic stage don increased back to 2 17 mg l which was entirely caused by increasing of c2 and c3 although the don reduced slightly to 1 30 mg l in the second anoxic phase it increased again in the subsequent aeration phase removal percentages of the parafac components in iacw were 39 71 for c1 47 37 for c2 85 15 for c3 and 33 27 for c4 respectively fig s4 in contrast in the cacw don decreased continuously as aeration proceeded and its removal occurred mainly via removing the protein like c2 and c3 removal percentages of c1 c2 c3 and c4 in cacw were 41 16 64 53 100 and 39 83 respectively fig s4 overall although the removal percentages of c1 and c4 components were comparable in iacw and cacw the effluent don from iacw was significantly higher than that from cacw due to the lower removal efficiency of c2 and c3 to further distinguish the removal selectivity of each fluorescent component under different operational conditions various characteristics of don and fluorescent components were compared as shown in fig 5 in the first aerobic stage 0 60 min c1 c2 and c4 were all negative whereas don and c3 were positive in both iacw and cacw in other words in the first aerobic stage the concentration of don decreased drastically along with the decrease of c3 even when the concentrations of c1 c2 and c4 fluorophores all increased these results suggested that simple aromatic proteins like c3 could be more easily removed than other fluorescent components and don removal was mainly based on removing proteins like c3 in the first aerobic stage moreover the simple aromatic proteins like c3 were likely not completely biodegraded but instead were partially transformed into don with other fluorophores and thus resulting in an increase of c1 c2 and c4 apart from the first aerobic stage a strong linear relationship between don and c2 and between don and c3 was observed in cacw and no obvious differences in this relationship were found over the reaction periods in contrast although don c1 and c4 were all positive after the first aerobic stage no significant correlation was found between don and c1 or between don and c4 this result was consistent with previous studies which indicated that protein like components were more easily removed during the wastewater treatment process in comparison with cacw plotting don against c1 c2 c3 or c4 in iacw differed among the treatment conditions aerobic and anoxic especially c1 c2 c3 and c4 were all positive in the anoxic stage 60 330 min and 390 660 min and all showed a strong linear correlation with don on the contrary c2 c3 and don were all negative while c1 and c4 were nearly zero in the post aerobic stage aerobic stage after anoxic conditions 330 390 min and 660 720 min these results suggested that don was selectively removed by anoxic treatment in iacw whereas aerobic treatment seemed to inhibit don removal however in the cacw c1 c2 c3 and c4 were all removed efficiently under aerobic conditions these contrary outcomes raise a question regarding the major factor controlling don removal in this study there were two major operational parameters different between iacw and cacw 1 aeration mode intermittent aeration for iacw and continuous aeration for cacw 2 do concentration during aeration 3 0 5 0 mg l for iacw and 0 6 1 2 mg l for cacw to distinguish the effect of these two operational parameters on don removal a continuous aerated batch experiment was conducted as shown in fig s5 when do concentration was maintained at 3 0 5 0 mg l under continuous aeration condition don and fluorescent components decreased gradually over operation periods and showed similar patterns of variation with low do concentration under lab culture conditions these results indicated that alternated anoxic aerobic conditions instead of do concentration should be the major operational factor affecting don removal it is also very interesting to explore the main source of the increased fluorescent compounds during the post aerobic phase in iacw generally if the increase of protein like fluorescent compounds c2 and c3 were mainly caused by incomplete biodegradation of other fluorescent compounds c1 and c4 a higher decreased concentration of such incomplete biodegraded fluorescent compounds than that of protein like fluorescent compounds could be expected however in the post aerobic stage c1 and c4 were nearly zero whereas c2 and c3 concentrations both increased rapidly and showed a strong linear relationship with don this suggested that the release of smps instead of incomplete biodegradation of other fluorescent components should be the major source of the increase of c2 and c3 during the post aerobic phase although the mechanism of the sudden increase of protein like c2 and c3 in the post aerobic process was still unclear similar phenomena were found in previous studies huo et al 2013 yang et al 2020 for instance eom et al 2017 found that most don was removed by anaerobic and anoxic treatment whereas an increase in don concentration was observed in aerobic units in a full scale activated sludge wwtp zhang et al 2016 revealed that in an anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o bioreactor higher don concentration was mainly caused by the protein like substance formation during the aerobic phase therefore it seems that suddenly shifting the environment from an anaerobic anoxic condition to an aerobic condition would stimulate microorganisms to release smps and thus enhance don especially abdon concentration during the treatment process 3 4 phytoplankton growth supported by iacw and cacw effluents to better understand the ecological impacts of the increased don discharge on the aquatic environment lab bioassay studies were conducted to investigate and compare phytoplankton growth supported by iacw and cacw effluents patterns of n consumption and algae growth were similar for the same type of cw effluent in three sets of bioassays thus only the results from one bioassay set that was conducted on day 115 were shown in fig 6 the results of other bioassay sets were presented in fig s6 with respect to don utilization s capricornutum and m aeruginosa both showed high don utilization ability while their don utilization patterns were obviously different fig 6 for m aeruginosa removal of don occurred at the beginning of the bioassay regardless of the type of effluent and most of the don was removed during the initial period of bioassay day 1 8 when don which is easily absorbed and utilized by algae was used up din concentration started decreasing rapidly in m aeruginosa bioassay regardless of the type of effluents in contrast removal of don occurred much slower than din in s capricornutum group at the beginning of the bioassay day 1 8 only 3 00 12 08 of don was removed during the initial period of bioassay in terms of phytoplankton biomass production measured as chl a concentration regardless of algal species effluent from iacw always generated higher phytoplankton biomass than cacw effluents even though effluents from iacw contained less dtn than those from cacw for s capricornutum during the initial period of bioassay from days 1 8 the biomass concentration increased from 0 05 to 0 69 mg l of chl a in the iacw group which was accompanied by the decrease of din from 4 85 to 0 98 mg l and don from 1 25 to 1 10 mg l in parallel the biomass concentration increased from 0 05 to 0 59 mg l in the cacw group from days 1 8 accompanied by the decrease of din from 7 28 to 3 37 mg l and don from 0 48 to 0 46 mg l that is when mainly din was consumed as nitrogen sources neither the nitrogen removal efficiency nor n based biomass production was obviously different between the iacw group and cacw group however when din was almost used up in the iacw group the don concentration decreased rapidly from 1 10 to 0 26 mg l corresponding to the increase of biomass concentration from 0 69 to 1 31 from days 8 14 in contrast lower increased biomass from 0 59 to 1 16 mg l was observed in cacw group in which din was still the main nitrogen source din decreased from 3 37 to 0 42 mg l in comparison with s capricornutum an opposite growth pattern was found for m aeruginosa in detail when din and don were simultaneously utilized as nitrogen sources in the iacw group from days 1 10 its biomass concentration increased much faster than that in the cacw group 0 58 mg l of chl a in the iacw and 0 37 mg l of chl a in the cacw respectively however when don was almost used up there was no significant difference in n based biomass production between iacw and cacw these results implied that n based biomass productivity mass of biomass generated per mass of n consumed was greater for don than that for din which was also supported by relationships between ratios of consumed nitrogen forms din or don to dtn and n based biomass production as shown in fig s7 regardless of algal species a strong negative relationship could be observed between the consumed din dtn and n based biomass p 0 05 while the relationship between consumed don dtn and n based biomass was positive p 0 05 these results suggested that effluent don has a greater potential to simulate phytoplankton growth rate and biomass than din however apart from nitrogen phytoplankton growth may also be affected by many other factors such as phosphorus n p ratio and carbon sources das et al 2014 ha et al 2022 obernosterer and herndl 1995 despite this larger amounts of biomass in the iacw group than those in the cacw group were observed simultaneously in both of the algal species studied moreover although two algal species showed a different pattern of don utilization when don was consumed n based biomass production was both much higher than that of din furthermore to minimize the effect of other factors on algae growth except for the nitrogen source all necessary nutrients were in excess in the present bioassays consistent with the bg11 medium the nitrogen and phosphorus utilization results showed that in all sets of bioassays most dtn 88 72 95 41 was removed while only 37 20 57 63 of po 4 3 p was consumed table s2 confirming that the growth limiting substrate was nitrogen not phosphorus in the present bioassay studies all of these results suggest that the greater amount of don is likely the major reason why iacw effluents containing less tn caused larger increases in phytoplankton biomass than cacw effluent although there may be other factors that affect phytoplankton biomass 3 5 implications advanced nitrogen treatment technologies are increasingly implemented in various wastewater treatment systems worldwide in most cases the motivation is to reduce din discharge whereas little attention has been paid to other nitrogen forms does reducing din discharge is enough to inhibit nitrogen related eutrophication in receiving waters the results obtained from this study show that the link between the application of advanced nitrogen treatment technologies and eutrophication is more complex than previously thought firstly increasing din removal efficiency cannot ensure an improvement in don removal in contrast our results indicated that intermittent aeration is vulnerable to stimulating microorganisms to release smps and greatly increase the effluent don and abdon concentrations even though it can decrease tn by reducing din secondly the produced don is highly bioavailable to phytoplankton and shows a greater stimulating effect on algae biomass than din under lab culture conditions for a long time nitrogen regulations to control eutrophication have been developed primarily based on total maximum daily loads with underlying assumptions that all forms of nitrogen have an equal effect on algae growth pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2006 in other words it is assumed that reducing tn discharge could effectively mitigate nitrogen related eutrophication in receiving waters however bioassay studies show that s capricornutum and m aeruginosa incubated with effluent from iacw both generate larger increases in phytoplankton biomass than that with cacw effluent even though iacw effluent contains less tn than its counterpart these results suggested that even a small increase in don especially abdon in final effluent might offset the merit of reducing din and increase the risk of eutrophication in receiving waters thirdly don may also modify phytoplankton composition in receiving waters our bioassay studies revealed that s capricornutum and m aeruginosa exist different strategies for don utilization s capricornutum seems to utilize don only when din was not available whereas m aeruginosa seems to be able to simultaneously utilize don and din this implies that m aeruginosa may gain a competitive advantage in natural aquatic ecosystems where din and don are normally coexisting therefore a substantial increase in don discharge may also influence phytoplankton composition and stimulate harmful phytoplankton species in nitrogen sensitive aquatic ecosystems eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems is a complex phenomenon affected by a multitude of environmental factors including nutrients temperature light and food web structure koelmans et al 2001 additionally the don cycle is complicated in natural aquatic systems and substantial effluent don might be directly degraded into din before being utilized by phytoplankton therefore it is acknowledged that increasing don discharge does not necessarily lead to aquatic eutrophication nevertheless the significance of the present study is finding that upgrading cws may introduce more don especially abdon in the effluents and the merit of improving din removal performance by upgrading cws could be offset by the increased effluent don in china alone the area of cws exceeds 67 000 km2 zhang et al 2021 however what water quality outcomes should be expected under future increased application of advanced nitrogen removal technologies scenarios with the greater stimulating effect of don on phytoplankton especially harmful phytoplankton species growth in mind this paper proposes that solely controlling din discharge cannot ensure mitigation of nitrogen related eutrophication and more efforts should be paid to curb don discharge especially for receiving waters where wastewater treatment system effluent constitute a significant source of nitrogen pollution 4 conclusion this study investigated the effect of the aeration strategy on the concentration bioavailability molecular characteristics and fluorescent components of don in cws the results showed that suddenly shifting environment from an anoxic condition to an aerobic condition in the iacw would stimulate microorganisms to release proteins amino sugars like and carbohydrates like nitrogenous organic formulas which does not occur in cacw consequently although iacw effluents contained less tn than cacw it produced a larger amount of don particularly in the form of abdon more importantly s capricornutum and m aeruginosa incubated with iacw effluent both generate larger phytoplankton biomass than that with cacw effluent despite lower tn concentrations suggesting the merit of decreasing din discharge by applying intermittent aeration may be offset by increasing a small amount yet highly bioavailable don in effluents additionally s capricornutum seems to utilize the effluent don only when din was not available whereas m aeruginosa can simultaneously utilize don and din thus don discharge may also influence phytoplankton composition and stimulate harmful phytoplankton species in nitrogen sensitive aquatic ecosystems as advanced nitrogen treatment technologies are increasingly implemented in cws more holistic approaches toward selecting the proper design and operation of cws are thereby required taking into consideration the potential influence of effluent don on eutrophication and the

15161,to control eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems enhancing nitrogen removal in the constructed wetland cw by upgrading conventional cw to aeration cw is commonplace however regulatory efforts have only focused on reducing dissolved inorganic nitrogen din discharge and disregarding dissolved organic nitrogen don here we used experimental mesocosms to investigate the effect of aeration mode on the characteristics of effluent don in cw the results showed that intermittent aeration is prone to introduce large amounts of don and bioavailable don abdon in the effluents although it greatly decreases effluent total nitrogen tn analysis of don fluorescent components and molecular characteristics indicated that suddenly shifting the environment from anoxic condition to aerobic condition in the intermittent aeration cw iacw would stimulate microorganisms to release tryptophan and simple aromatic proteins like substances which does not occur in the limited continuous aeration cw cacw consequently the abundance of don resembling lipids proteins amino sugars and carbohydrates like molecules in iacw were about 2 1 times higher than that in cacw bioassay results showed that selenastrum capricornutum and microcystis aeruginosa incubated with effluent from iacw both generate larger phytoplankton biomass than that with cacw effluent even though iacw effluent contains less tn than its counterpart moreover microcystis aeruginosa can simultaneously utilize don and din while selenastrum capricornutum seem to utilize the don only when din was not available this result implies that increasing don discharge may also influence phytoplankton composition and stimulate harmful phytoplankton species overall this study indicates that upgrading cw solely depending on din removal level cannot ensure a mitigation of nitrogen related eutrophication and more efforts should be paid to curb don discharge graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic

resource management ho et al 2019 yao et al 2018 reducing nitrogen n loading is a primary management strategy to mitigate eutrophication conley et al 2009 given the practical advantages of ecological benefits and cost effectiveness constructed wetlands cws are widely used for nitrogen removal in economically developing areas and as tertiary nitrogen removal in existing wastewater treatment plants wwtps wang et al 2019 to meet the requirement of the more and more stringent total nitrogen tn discharge permit several types of aeration cws were invented in the last three decades e g artificial aeration effluent recirculation and tidal flow cws ilyas and masih 2017 although the effluent tn has decreased substantially in these aeration cws regulatory efforts have only focused on reducing dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and disregarding the dissolved organic nitrogen don don is an inevitable nitrogen component in the final effluents of wastewater treatment systems effluent don can cause a variety of problems including nitrogenous disinfection byproducts generating coloration and odor of water chu et al 2011 liao et al 2022 more importantly recent studies have shown that several components of the don pool are bioavailable abdon to phytoplankton and bacteria and are dynamic actors in aquatic ecosystems paul et al 2010 for instance in haizhou bay don has been proven to be a major source of nitrogen for phytoplankton zhang et al 2022 yet the possible effects of effluent don on eutrophication have been neglected in most studies this is mainly because don used to comprise a small fraction of effluent nitrogen however with recent advanced nitrogen treatment technologies most din can be efficiently removed and don becomes a non negligible even dominant component approximately 25 95 of residual nitrogen in the final effluent eom et al 2017 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2006 therefore understanding the characteristics of effluent don in wastewater treatment systems with high din removal efficiency has drawn a growing body of attention recently previous researches suggest that reducing din in the effluent cannot ensure a reduction in don or its bioavailability and the merit of removing din via upgrading wastewater treatment systems might be potentially offset by producing a small amount yet highly bioavailable don bronk et al 2007 he et al 2018 for instance a relative work of post denitrification biofilter system found that increasing the influent cod n ratio could greatly reduce the effluent din concentration but could not decrease the don concentration in the effluent hu et al 2018a similarly hu et al 2018b found that prolonging sludge retention time srt in the activated sludge system could enhance tn removal but can not sequester the abdon and occasionally contributed to greater amounts of abdon in effluents additionally a previous study reported that accelerating eutrophication and hypoxia continue to occur in the long island sound area even after a significant decrease of nitrogen loads with upgrades of wwtps from conventional activated sludge systems to predenitrification biological nutrient removal systems suter et al 2014 one possible explanation for this phenomenon is that predenitrification is prone to the production of low molecular weight don which can produce nearly 10 times more chlorophyll a chl a than din on a per mg n basis eom et al 2017 the unrelated removal performance of din and don urge the nutrient removal field of cws to move forward in answering the most practical and vital question regarding the nitrogen removal whether upgrading conventional cws to intensified cws would introduce more don or abdon in the final effluent consequently whether improving din removal efficiency via upgrading cws with high capital and operational costs could really alleviate eutrophication in receiving waters to address these questions two typical aeration cws an intermittent aeration cw and a limited continuous aeration cw were chosen as model systems the reasons for choosing these two types of cws are as follows 1 because of efficient nitrogen removal performance both intermittent aeration cw iacw and limited continuous aeration cw cacw have been widely applied in removing nitrogen from various wastewater 2 it has been well documented that aeration strategy plays an important role in controlling din removal in cws moreover recent studies found that the aeration strategy also could affect the removal of nitrogenous organic micropollutants and the production of soluble microbial products smps capodici et al 2015 which are both important fractions of don hu et al 2020a thus it is expected that the artificial aeration would not only affect the din removal but also don removal in cws 3 from practical perspectives the chemical fraction of effluent don varied depending on the influent sources cannot be easily controllable however the microbially derived don produced during the treatment process could be regulated by adjusting the operation condition therefore understanding the role of aeration strategy on the performance of don removal will assist in the proper design and operation of cws the objectives of this study were to investigate whether and how artificial aeration affects effluent don concentration chemical composition and bioavailability in cws to determine the major environmental factors affecting the characteristics of effluent don and to access the potential ecological risks of effluent don with respect to eutrophication 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the lab scale wetland two parallel lab scale vertical flow cws were constructed with pvc column height 120 cm diameter 20 cm in the greenhouse with temperature controlled at 24 3 the cw bed contained a 10 cm supporting layer filled with gravel with a diameter ranging from 2 to 3 cm followed by an 80 cm treatment layer filled with gravel with a diameter ranging from 0 8 to 1 cm fig 1 in the middle of cw bed a vertical perforated pvc pipe diameter 3 cm was pre buried for monitoring the parameters temperature do and ph in situ with a ysi pro professional plus usa air was supplied from a diffuser placed on the support layer and the aeration rate was controlled by an airflow meter the initial working volume was 8 79 l for each cw to minimize the effects of fluctuations in plant growth on don removal performance iris pseudacorus with a strong adaptation to the environment and strong stress resistance was selected and planted in cw jia et al 2018 li et al 2021 the density of iris pseudacorus was 50 plants m2 the influent raw wastewater was collected from an on campus septic tank effluent in the huazhong agricultural university wuhan china the raw wastewater was firstly pumped into an intermediate tank 1 m3 and set for one week before being pumped into the cws the water table was kept 3 cm below the substrate surface a summary of influent characteristics is shown in table s1 and fig s1 the hydraulic retention time hrt of the cw was fixed at 12 h 2 2 process operation and samples collection the overall experiment was divided into the start up period 60 days and operation period 135 days during the start up period both cws were operated under continuous aeration with a do concentration of 0 6 1 2 mg l by adjusting the aeration flow rate to facilitate the development of microbes and plants after the effluent tn and din became stable two strategies were executed in cws as previously done by fan et al 2013 intermittent aeration with an airflow rate of 400 ml min for 1 h do concentration of 3 0 5 0 mg l and non aeration for 4 5 h was applied in one cw termed as iacw meanwhile the other cw was maintained as limited continuous aeration termed as cacw with an airflow flow rate of 60 ml min do concentration of 0 6 1 2 mg l the system was then maintained at the same operational conditions for about two weeks to verify and ensure the effluent tn and din became stable during the operation period water samples of influent and effluent were collected twice per week for analyzing nh 4 n no 2 n no 3 n and total dissolved nitrogen tdn to investigate the effect of the aeration mode on don removal characteristics five don samples were used for don bioavailability determination and don molecular composition analysis to investigate the influence of aeration modes on don removal high time resolutions within the cycle study were conducted on days 57 89 and 123 respectively during each within cycle study water samples were collected over time during the whole operation period to investigate the change of nh 4 n no 2 n no 3 n tdn and fluorescent components in detail water samples were collected every 30 min during the aerobic stage and every 90 min during the anoxic stage for iacw and the sampling frequencies of cacw were the same as those of iacw 2 3 bioassay a total of three sets of bioassays were performed on effluents from iacw and cacw day 40 82 and 115 each bioassays test was performed in triplicates selenastrum capricornutum s capricornutum and microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa were chosen as the algal species for the bioassay studies because they have been widely used as standard test organisms for eutrophication pehlivanoglu and sedlak 2004 halling sùrensen 2000 and m aeruginosa is also the most common bloom forming phytoplankton species in freshwater eutrophic lakes stone 2011 the algal species used in this study were obtained from the center of culture collection of algae at the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences on the starting day of each bioassay water samples were collected from the lake nanhu a typical freshwater eutrophic lake located in wuhan china these water samples were brought back to the laboratory within 1 h of collection 5 l of water was firstly filtered through a 0 7 μm glass fiber filter to remove particles and algae and then filtered through a 0 2 μm membrane filter the retentate on the 0 2 μm filter was resuspended in 50 ml of the 0 2 μm filtered water and used as the bacterial inoculum to start the bioassay 1 5 ml of n starved algal seeds 1 5 ml bacterial inoculum and 100 ml milli q water were added to 100 ml of filter sterilized effluents 0 2 μm membrane filter in a 500 ml erlenmeyer flask moreover to ensure all necessary nutrients except for nitrogen were adequate during the bioassay potassium phosphate k2hpo4 was added to the media to give an initial p concentration of 7 0 mg l the same as bg 11 culture medium and 2 ml of 100 bg 11 stock solution without nitrogen and phosphorus was also added to the media to supply the other necessary nutrition e g mg2 sulfur and carbon source each bioassay was incubated in triplicate at 25 1 with a 12 12 h light dark cycle in a photobioreactor the light intensity was kept at 2500 lux the sampling of biomass measured as chl a nitrogen and phosphorus p were conducted every 2 days 2 4 batch tests batch tests were conducted to explore the effect of do concentrations on don characteristics of cacw on the 136th day the do concentration of cacw was adjusted to 3 0 5 0 mg l and other operating parameters and environmental conditions were kept the same as before the tests were performed for 2 weeks during the batch tests water samples overtime during the whole operation period were collected in duplication to investigate the change of nh 4 n no 2 n no 3 n tdn and fluorescent components 2 5 analytical methods nh 4 n no 2 n no 3 n po 4 3 p tdn and chl a were analyzed using standard methods apha 2005 the don concentration was determined by the difference between tdn and din the abdon and bioavailability of don were determined with a 14 day algal growth bioassay hu et al 2020b the don molecular composition was analyzed according to hu et al 2018a details of the abdon measurement don bioavailability calculation and the don molecular composition analysis are provided in the supporting information the fluorescent components were measured using the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3deem in a fluorescent spectrophotometer f 4600 fl spectrophotometer hitachi japan during the scanning the excitation wavelength was set from 200 nm to 450 nm with 5 nm intervals while the emission wavelength was set from 250 nm to 600 nm with 5 nm intervals the excitation and emission slits were maintained at 5 nm and the scanning speed was set at 1200 nm min with a pmt voltage of 700 v to distinguish the removal selectivity of each fluorescent component under different operational conditions the don and fluorescent components were calculated as fllows 3 δ don don previous sampling time don present sampling time 4 δ fluorescent component fluorescent component previous sampling time fluorescent component present sampling time 2 6 statistical analysis student s t test and anova analysis were performed using the spss 19 0 package ibm armonk new york with a value of 0 05 or 0 01 selected for significance the parafac analysis was carried out in matlab r2018a mathworks usa the difference in don composition between cws was analyzed using permutation multivariate analysis of variance permanova based on pcoa bray curtis distances using r software r studio pbc boston ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall nitrogen removal performance 3 1 1 effluent tn and din of the cws effluent tn and different forms of din in two cws are presented in fig 2 the iacw showed a significantly higher tn removal efficiency 73 92 than the cacw 64 03 p 0 01 as reported tn removal in cws was mainly dependent on the coupled nitrification denitrification process wu et al 2016 as shown in fig 2a complete nh 4 n removal was achieved in both iacw and cacw in which effluent nh 4 n concentrations were all below 1 50 mg l and no no 2 n accumulation was observed in any of the cws 0 06 mg l these results were consistent with previous studies indicating artificial aeration is an effective way to establish complete nitrification in cws hou et al 2017 with effective nitrification no 3 n became a major part of the effluent din in both iacw and cacw however the effluent no 3 n concentration in iacw 11 82 mg l was significantly lower than that in cacw 16 94 mg l p 0 01 the result was in keeping with previous observational studies indicating continuous aeration could promote ammonium removal 98 78 but often resulted in nitrate accumulation in the effluent tang et al 2021 on the other hand intermittent aeration was a reliable way to enhance the tn removal performance of cws via developing alternated aerobic and anoxic conditions for nitrification and denitrification hu et al 2012 wu et al 2015 3 1 2 effluent don abdon and don bioavailability of the cws although iacw effluent contained much less effluent tn it contained 2 1 times as many effluent don as cacw as detailed in fig 2b the effluent don concentrations in iacw 1 93 mg l on average were always higher than that in cacw 0 90 mg l on average p 0 05 despite a high frequent change of influent don fig s1 moreover the effluent abdon in iacw 1 25 mg l was also significantly higher than that in cacw 0 32 mg l p 0 05 and there was a significant increase of don bioavailability abdon don in iacw p 0 05 fig s2 the significant increase in effluent abdon and don bioavailability implied that not only concentration but also the chemical composition of effluent don was different between iacw and cacw taken together the above results illustrated that an intermittent aeration strategy could lead to more don in the effluent of the cw particularly in the form of abdon although it greatly decreases tn by reducing din 3 2 molecular compositions of effluent don in the cws to gain insight into the impact of aeration strategies on the characteristics of effluent don in cws the molecular composition of effluent don was analyzed by fticr ms fig 3 despite the higher effluent concentration of don and abdon in iacw no significant difference was found in effluent don composition between iacw and cacw permanova s p 0 05 however if the data were analyzed separately for h c 1 5 regions and h c 1 5 regions the composition of molecules in h c 1 5 regions was significantly different between iacw and cacw permanova s p 0 05 especially only 38 57 of the identified don molecules in h c 1 5 regions were consistent in the effluent of iacw and cacw moreover the chemodiversity and relative abundance of molecules in h c 1 5 regions from iacw 247 formulae in diversity and 63 66 in relative abundance were both higher than that from cacw 141 formulae in diversity and 36 34 in relative abundance based on previous studies molecules in h c 1 5 regions are likely to be microbially derived don and are more bioavailable hu et al 2018b ohno et al 2014 thus the effluent don from iacw which is more lipids h c 1 7 2 2 o c 0 0 2 proteins amino sugars h c 1 5 2 2 o c 0 2 0 6 n c 0 05 and carbohydrates like h c 1 5 2 2 o c 0 6 1 in character is likely the reason why the highly bioavailable of effluent don was observed in the iacw to further distinguish the source of effluent don the differences in n containing molecular formulas between influent and effluent of iacw and between influent and effluent of cacw were analyzed don molecules were divided into recalcitrant consumed and produced parts respectively based on the venn diagram recalcitrant don is the don molecules that exist in the influent and remain in the effluent consumed don is the don molecules that exist in the influent but disappear in the effluent and the produced don is the molecules that appear only in the effluent there were no significant differences in recalcitrant and consumed don compositions between iacw and cacw permanova s p 0 05 however a significant difference in produced don composition was observed permanova s p 0 05 specifically over 80 of the identified consumed and recalcitrant don molecules were consistent between iacw and cacw while only 49 of produced don molecules were consistent between iacw and cacw moreover among the produced don iacw tended to generate more proteins amino sugars molecules 130 molecules in iacw and 58 molecules in cacw respectively carbohydrates molecules 52 molecules in iacw and 33 molecules in cacw respectively and lipids like molecules 11 molecules in iacw and 1 molecule in cacw respectively in contrast cacw tended to produce more unsaturated hydrocarbons 7 molecules in iacw and 20 molecules in cacw respectively condensed aromatics 54 molecules in cacw and 23 molecules in iacw respectively and tannins like 229 molecules in iacw and 265 molecules in cacw respectively nitrogenous substances taking the don molecule abundance into consideration the abundance of produced don in iacw was about 1 13 times higher than that in cacw and the abundance of produced don resembling lipids proteins amino sugars and carbohydrates in iacw was about 2 1 times higher than that in cacw in contrast there was no obvious difference in consumed and recalcitrant don between iacw and cacw in terms of abundance based on these results the high effluent don concentration and bioavailability observed in iacw were likely mainly contributed by the generation of microbially derived nitrogenous organics 3 3 variations in fluorescent components and don over the treatment process changes in fluorescent components during the whole operation process were monitored to better understand the cause of the greater amount of don especially abdon present in iacw effluents compared to cacw effluents four fluorescent components were identified from all the measured samples in the eem spectra based on previous studies c1 and c4 are likely from humic like compounds c2 is likely from tryptophan protein like compounds and c3 from simple aromatic protein like compounds hu et al 2020b komatsu et al 2020 tang et al 2020 xue et al 2017 fig s3 fig 4 shows the changes in don and fluorescent components over the operation period in the iacw don decreased rapidly from 8 61 mg l to 1 73 mg l during the first aerobic and anoxic stage fig 4a however during the second aerobic stage don increased back to 2 17 mg l which was entirely caused by increasing of c2 and c3 although the don reduced slightly to 1 30 mg l in the second anoxic phase it increased again in the subsequent aeration phase removal percentages of the parafac components in iacw were 39 71 for c1 47 37 for c2 85 15 for c3 and 33 27 for c4 respectively fig s4 in contrast in the cacw don decreased continuously as aeration proceeded and its removal occurred mainly via removing the protein like c2 and c3 removal percentages of c1 c2 c3 and c4 in cacw were 41 16 64 53 100 and 39 83 respectively fig s4 overall although the removal percentages of c1 and c4 components were comparable in iacw and cacw the effluent don from iacw was significantly higher than that from cacw due to the lower removal efficiency of c2 and c3 to further distinguish the removal selectivity of each fluorescent component under different operational conditions various characteristics of don and fluorescent components were compared as shown in fig 5 in the first aerobic stage 0 60 min c1 c2 and c4 were all negative whereas don and c3 were positive in both iacw and cacw in other words in the first aerobic stage the concentration of don decreased drastically along with the decrease of c3 even when the concentrations of c1 c2 and c4 fluorophores all increased these results suggested that simple aromatic proteins like c3 could be more easily removed than other fluorescent components and don removal was mainly based on removing proteins like c3 in the first aerobic stage moreover the simple aromatic proteins like c3 were likely not completely biodegraded but instead were partially transformed into don with other fluorophores and thus resulting in an increase of c1 c2 and c4 apart from the first aerobic stage a strong linear relationship between don and c2 and between don and c3 was observed in cacw and no obvious differences in this relationship were found over the reaction periods in contrast although don c1 and c4 were all positive after the first aerobic stage no significant correlation was found between don and c1 or between don and c4 this result was consistent with previous studies which indicated that protein like components were more easily removed during the wastewater treatment process in comparison with cacw plotting don against c1 c2 c3 or c4 in iacw differed among the treatment conditions aerobic and anoxic especially c1 c2 c3 and c4 were all positive in the anoxic stage 60 330 min and 390 660 min and all showed a strong linear correlation with don on the contrary c2 c3 and don were all negative while c1 and c4 were nearly zero in the post aerobic stage aerobic stage after anoxic conditions 330 390 min and 660 720 min these results suggested that don was selectively removed by anoxic treatment in iacw whereas aerobic treatment seemed to inhibit don removal however in the cacw c1 c2 c3 and c4 were all removed efficiently under aerobic conditions these contrary outcomes raise a question regarding the major factor controlling don removal in this study there were two major operational parameters different between iacw and cacw 1 aeration mode intermittent aeration for iacw and continuous aeration for cacw 2 do concentration during aeration 3 0 5 0 mg l for iacw and 0 6 1 2 mg l for cacw to distinguish the effect of these two operational parameters on don removal a continuous aerated batch experiment was conducted as shown in fig s5 when do concentration was maintained at 3 0 5 0 mg l under continuous aeration condition don and fluorescent components decreased gradually over operation periods and showed similar patterns of variation with low do concentration under lab culture conditions these results indicated that alternated anoxic aerobic conditions instead of do concentration should be the major operational factor affecting don removal it is also very interesting to explore the main source of the increased fluorescent compounds during the post aerobic phase in iacw generally if the increase of protein like fluorescent compounds c2 and c3 were mainly caused by incomplete biodegradation of other fluorescent compounds c1 and c4 a higher decreased concentration of such incomplete biodegraded fluorescent compounds than that of protein like fluorescent compounds could be expected however in the post aerobic stage c1 and c4 were nearly zero whereas c2 and c3 concentrations both increased rapidly and showed a strong linear relationship with don this suggested that the release of smps instead of incomplete biodegradation of other fluorescent components should be the major source of the increase of c2 and c3 during the post aerobic phase although the mechanism of the sudden increase of protein like c2 and c3 in the post aerobic process was still unclear similar phenomena were found in previous studies huo et al 2013 yang et al 2020 for instance eom et al 2017 found that most don was removed by anaerobic and anoxic treatment whereas an increase in don concentration was observed in aerobic units in a full scale activated sludge wwtp zhang et al 2016 revealed that in an anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o bioreactor higher don concentration was mainly caused by the protein like substance formation during the aerobic phase therefore it seems that suddenly shifting the environment from an anaerobic anoxic condition to an aerobic condition would stimulate microorganisms to release smps and thus enhance don especially abdon concentration during the treatment process 3 4 phytoplankton growth supported by iacw and cacw effluents to better understand the ecological impacts of the increased don discharge on the aquatic environment lab bioassay studies were conducted to investigate and compare phytoplankton growth supported by iacw and cacw effluents patterns of n consumption and algae growth were similar for the same type of cw effluent in three sets of bioassays thus only the results from one bioassay set that was conducted on day 115 were shown in fig 6 the results of other bioassay sets were presented in fig s6 with respect to don utilization s capricornutum and m aeruginosa both showed high don utilization ability while their don utilization patterns were obviously different fig 6 for m aeruginosa removal of don occurred at the beginning of the bioassay regardless of the type of effluent and most of the don was removed during the initial period of bioassay day 1 8 when don which is easily absorbed and utilized by algae was used up din concentration started decreasing rapidly in m aeruginosa bioassay regardless of the type of effluents in contrast removal of don occurred much slower than din in s capricornutum group at the beginning of the bioassay day 1 8 only 3 00 12 08 of don was removed during the initial period of bioassay in terms of phytoplankton biomass production measured as chl a concentration regardless of algal species effluent from iacw always generated higher phytoplankton biomass than cacw effluents even though effluents from iacw contained less dtn than those from cacw for s capricornutum during the initial period of bioassay from days 1 8 the biomass concentration increased from 0 05 to 0 69 mg l of chl a in the iacw group which was accompanied by the decrease of din from 4 85 to 0 98 mg l and don from 1 25 to 1 10 mg l in parallel the biomass concentration increased from 0 05 to 0 59 mg l in the cacw group from days 1 8 accompanied by the decrease of din from 7 28 to 3 37 mg l and don from 0 48 to 0 46 mg l that is when mainly din was consumed as nitrogen sources neither the nitrogen removal efficiency nor n based biomass production was obviously different between the iacw group and cacw group however when din was almost used up in the iacw group the don concentration decreased rapidly from 1 10 to 0 26 mg l corresponding to the increase of biomass concentration from 0 69 to 1 31 from days 8 14 in contrast lower increased biomass from 0 59 to 1 16 mg l was observed in cacw group in which din was still the main nitrogen source din decreased from 3 37 to 0 42 mg l in comparison with s capricornutum an opposite growth pattern was found for m aeruginosa in detail when din and don were simultaneously utilized as nitrogen sources in the iacw group from days 1 10 its biomass concentration increased much faster than that in the cacw group 0 58 mg l of chl a in the iacw and 0 37 mg l of chl a in the cacw respectively however when don was almost used up there was no significant difference in n based biomass production between iacw and cacw these results implied that n based biomass productivity mass of biomass generated per mass of n consumed was greater for don than that for din which was also supported by relationships between ratios of consumed nitrogen forms din or don to dtn and n based biomass production as shown in fig s7 regardless of algal species a strong negative relationship could be observed between the consumed din dtn and n based biomass p 0 05 while the relationship between consumed don dtn and n based biomass was positive p 0 05 these results suggested that effluent don has a greater potential to simulate phytoplankton growth rate and biomass than din however apart from nitrogen phytoplankton growth may also be affected by many other factors such as phosphorus n p ratio and carbon sources das et al 2014 ha et al 2022 obernosterer and herndl 1995 despite this larger amounts of biomass in the iacw group than those in the cacw group were observed simultaneously in both of the algal species studied moreover although two algal species showed a different pattern of don utilization when don was consumed n based biomass production was both much higher than that of din furthermore to minimize the effect of other factors on algae growth except for the nitrogen source all necessary nutrients were in excess in the present bioassays consistent with the bg11 medium the nitrogen and phosphorus utilization results showed that in all sets of bioassays most dtn 88 72 95 41 was removed while only 37 20 57 63 of po 4 3 p was consumed table s2 confirming that the growth limiting substrate was nitrogen not phosphorus in the present bioassay studies all of these results suggest that the greater amount of don is likely the major reason why iacw effluents containing less tn caused larger increases in phytoplankton biomass than cacw effluent although there may be other factors that affect phytoplankton biomass 3 5 implications advanced nitrogen treatment technologies are increasingly implemented in various wastewater treatment systems worldwide in most cases the motivation is to reduce din discharge whereas little attention has been paid to other nitrogen forms does reducing din discharge is enough to inhibit nitrogen related eutrophication in receiving waters the results obtained from this study show that the link between the application of advanced nitrogen treatment technologies and eutrophication is more complex than previously thought firstly increasing din removal efficiency cannot ensure an improvement in don removal in contrast our results indicated that intermittent aeration is vulnerable to stimulating microorganisms to release smps and greatly increase the effluent don and abdon concentrations even though it can decrease tn by reducing din secondly the produced don is highly bioavailable to phytoplankton and shows a greater stimulating effect on algae biomass than din under lab culture conditions for a long time nitrogen regulations to control eutrophication have been developed primarily based on total maximum daily loads with underlying assumptions that all forms of nitrogen have an equal effect on algae growth pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2006 in other words it is assumed that reducing tn discharge could effectively mitigate nitrogen related eutrophication in receiving waters however bioassay studies show that s capricornutum and m aeruginosa incubated with effluent from iacw both generate larger increases in phytoplankton biomass than that with cacw effluent even though iacw effluent contains less tn than its counterpart these results suggested that even a small increase in don especially abdon in final effluent might offset the merit of reducing din and increase the risk of eutrophication in receiving waters thirdly don may also modify phytoplankton composition in receiving waters our bioassay studies revealed that s capricornutum and m aeruginosa exist different strategies for don utilization s capricornutum seems to utilize don only when din was not available whereas m aeruginosa seems to be able to simultaneously utilize don and din this implies that m aeruginosa may gain a competitive advantage in natural aquatic ecosystems where din and don are normally coexisting therefore a substantial increase in don discharge may also influence phytoplankton composition and stimulate harmful phytoplankton species in nitrogen sensitive aquatic ecosystems eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems is a complex phenomenon affected by a multitude of environmental factors including nutrients temperature light and food web structure koelmans et al 2001 additionally the don cycle is complicated in natural aquatic systems and substantial effluent don might be directly degraded into din before being utilized by phytoplankton therefore it is acknowledged that increasing don discharge does not necessarily lead to aquatic eutrophication nevertheless the significance of the present study is finding that upgrading cws may introduce more don especially abdon in the effluents and the merit of improving din removal performance by upgrading cws could be offset by the increased effluent don in china alone the area of cws exceeds 67 000 km2 zhang et al 2021 however what water quality outcomes should be expected under future increased application of advanced nitrogen removal technologies scenarios with the greater stimulating effect of don on phytoplankton especially harmful phytoplankton species growth in mind this paper proposes that solely controlling din discharge cannot ensure mitigation of nitrogen related eutrophication and more efforts should be paid to curb don discharge especially for receiving waters where wastewater treatment system effluent constitute a significant source of nitrogen pollution 4 conclusion this study investigated the effect of the aeration strategy on the concentration bioavailability molecular characteristics and fluorescent components of don in cws the results showed that suddenly shifting environment from an anoxic condition to an aerobic condition in the iacw would stimulate microorganisms to release proteins amino sugars like and carbohydrates like nitrogenous organic formulas which does not occur in cacw consequently although iacw effluents contained less tn than cacw it produced a larger amount of don particularly in the form of abdon more importantly s capricornutum and m aeruginosa incubated with iacw effluent both generate larger phytoplankton biomass than that with cacw effluent despite lower tn concentrations suggesting the merit of decreasing din discharge by applying intermittent aeration may be offset by increasing a small amount yet highly bioavailable don in effluents additionally s capricornutum seems to utilize the effluent don only when din was not available whereas m aeruginosa can simultaneously utilize don and din thus don discharge may also influence phytoplankton composition and stimulate harmful phytoplankton species in nitrogen sensitive aquatic ecosystems as advanced nitrogen treatment technologies are increasingly implemented in cws more holistic approaches toward selecting the proper design and operation of cws are thereby required taking into consideration the potential influence of effluent don on eutrophication and the methods to minimize the discharge of bioavailable don declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgments this work was supported by the

15162,domestic wastewater dww contains a reservoir of nutrients such as nitrogen potassium and phosphorus however emerging micropollutants emps hinder its applications in resource recovery in this study a novel class of nanofiltration nf membranes was developed it enabled the efficient removal of harmful emp constituents while preserving valuable nutrients in the permeate neutral im n and positively charged im p imidazole derivative compounds have been used to chemically functionalize pristine polyamide pa membranes to synchronously inhibit the hydrolysis of residual acyl chloride and promote their amination owing to their distinct properties these im modifiers can custom build the membrane physicochemical properties and structures to benefit the nf process in dww treatment the electroneutral nf membrane exhibited ultrahigh solute solute selectivity by minimizing the donnan effects on ion penetration k n and p ions rejection 25 while imposing remarkable size sieving obstruction against emps rejection ratio 91 moreover the hydrophilic im modifier synergistically led to enhanced water permeance of 9 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 reaching a 2 fold higher magnitude than that of the pristine pa membrane along with excellent antifouling antibacterial fouling properties this study may provide a paradigm shift in membrane technology to convert wastewater streams into valuable water and nutrient resources graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanofiltration imidazole derivative compound electroneutral membrane interfacial polymerization solute solute selectivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the escalating global food consumption demands sustainable agricultural management to supply clean safe and adequate food modern agriculture relies upon the usage of fertilizers rich in nitrogen n potassium k and phosphorus p international fertilizer association forecasted that the global demand for k2o n and p2o5 will be increased to 41 2 114 5 and 52 5 megatonne mt respectively by 2025 chang et al 2022 the main employed procedure for producing most n fertilizers harber bosch is energy intensive with a significant carbon footprint consuming nearly 1 of the global energy supply xie et al 2016 at current consumption rates the reserve of potash which is a non renewable resource is estimated to get exhausted in 93 years while phosphate rock reserves are estimated to be depleted within the next 100 years walan et al 2014 under such circumstances domestic wastewater dww has gained considerable attention as an alternative to the recovery of fertilizer resources approximately 30 and 15 of the n and p respectively applied as fertilizers end up in dww which has the potential to serve nearly half of the global market johansson et al 2017 johansson et al 2019 small et al 2019 currently nearly 80 of n is transferred to nitrogen by microbes generating high volumes of wet sludge by products approximately 90 of p is lost after precipitation creating solid waste or minerals that cannot be absorbed by plants li et al 2015 all wastes are dried and require final disposal in landfills accounting for 30 50 of dww treatment costs ansari et al 2017 li et al 2015 moreover most nutrient resource recovery technologies target side streams containing less than 30 of the nutrients in their effluents small et al 2019 wielemaker et al 2019 by utilizing proper treatment processes these valuable elements including k n and p can be separated from dww providing reliable nutrient resources without using extra energy therefore the development of a new technology that enables efficient nutrient resource recovery from dww mainstream is highly desired however the presence of emerging micropollutants emps tends to degenerate the utilization of dww for agricultural irrigation luo et al 2014 consequently the selective removal of harmful emps while preserving nutrient constituents is of paramount importance for resource recovery from dww treatments nanofiltration nf has become the most promising technology to address the severe shortage of nutrient recovery through the dww process without adding excessive chemicals such as coagulants thereby reducing the uncertainties of the produced water nf membranes play an increasingly important role in differentiating organic compounds and inorganic salts by the synergistic effects of size exclusion molecular weight cut off mwco of 200 1000 da and electrostatic repulsion donnan effect teow et al 2021 however owing to the small molecular weights of emps such as trimethoprim tmp 290 da carbamazepine cbz 236 da and diclofenac dcf 318 da and similar charged states at neutral ph conditions to nf membrane surfaces the existing polyamide pa based nf membranes still struggle to achieve high fractionation of emps while enhancing target nutrient ion permeation guo et al 2019 commercial nf membranes have been used to separate po4 2 from sewage sludge but their inhomogeneous pore size distributions with tight structures lead to an undesired high rejection ratio lópez et al 2022 some studies reported lower primary phosphorous average rejection capability 40 however they still maintained high rejection against the other metal cation nutrients 85 remmen et al 2019 soyekwo et al 2019 thong et al 2016 under highly acidic ph values 0 7 2 owing to the strengthened donnan exclusion effect another recently published study fabricated nanofiltration membranes with less negatively charged properties the membrane showed promise in solute nutrient ions solute polyfluoroalkyl substances separation zhao et al 2022b however the precise separation of nutrients from coexisting emp contaminants has not yet been achieved and the solute solute selectivity of these important species requires ultrahighly selective nf membranes to realize cost effective and valuable resource recovery the performance of the solute solute separation between nutrient ions k nh4 no3 h2po4 hpo4 2 and emps tmp cbz and dcf under neutral ph conditions is primarily dependent on the properties of the pa selective layer most reported pa nf membranes are electrically charged cheng et al 2015 tang et al 2022 owing to the formation of surface functional groups i e carboxyl or amino following the interfacial polymerization ip process istirokhatun et al 2022 zhao et al 2022a the negatively or positively charged states of nf membranes lead to the high rejection of nutrient anions or cations fan et al 2018 but the unsatisfactory selectivity of emps with counter ionic valence consequently an electroneutral nf membrane can theoretically achieve a comparable membrane rejection capability against various electrically charged solutes which is favorable for achieving excellent overall removal of emps with varied charges in the feed water zhao et al 2017 furthermore the nf membrane should possess precise pore sizes that can efficiently fractionate low molecular weight emps from relatively small nutrient ions within an extremely small pore range of 0 3 0 4 nm table s1 a sharp pore size distribution with a tightly uniform pore structure plays a key role in ensuring efficient separation at the angstrom or even sub angstrom level which can usually be achieved using materials with strictly controlled free volume cavities lu et al 2020 zheng et al 2016 however all these membranes are only developed based on complicated reaction processes with increased expenses consequently the development of a neutral nf membrane with ultrahigh selectivity which mainly utilizes size exclusion rather than donnan equilibrium holds great promise for treating high pollution dww effluents rich in nutrient ions however little progress has been achieved to date a new class of imidazole derivatives of n 3 aminopropyl imidazole has been developed as grafting monomers to achieve membrane surface functionalization sun et al bai et al 2022 constructed an acid resistant nf membrane with highly efficient separation of metal ions at lower ph values of 1 3 after modification with im n compounds kim et al tuan et al 2018 grafted poly arylene ether ketone s with pendant imidazolium groups to fabricate an anion exchange membrane and found that an improved anion conductivity could be obtained by introducing more monomers after their quaternization treatment with ch3i active amine groups were further employed to develop nf membranes with positively charged properties by blending with piperazine pip monomers to strengthen the donnan effect against metal ionic solutes jin et al 2020 consequently it can be concluded that the imidazole derivatives were chosen as modification monomers because of the following advantages 1 the highly active primary amine groups can react with acyl chloride groups of tmc forming covalent bonds and ensuring the validity of the modification 2 only one functional group amine can participate in the grafting reaction to avoid the formation of excess polymer network to a minimum extent without blocking pore channels 3 the imidazole groups can be easily protonated through quaternization treatment to further adjust the membrane surface charge properties for specific separation purposes in this study an ultrahighly selective membrane was fabricated through the in situ modification of imidazole derivative compounds which have a neutral and positive charge with the advantages of design flexibility high stability and environmental friendliness reis et al 2015 anchoring compounds with distinct properties onto the pa membrane surface through a fast one step reaction under mild conditions inhibited the hydrolysis of acyl chloride groups into carboxyl groups thereby reducing the negative membrane charge and identifying the factors that govern membrane separation fig 1a meanwhile highly packed imidazole derivative compounds ims could act as an effective nanofluidic platform to precisely regulate pore structures without compromising water permeability as a result the proposed electroneutral nf membrane exhibited excellent solute emps solute nutrient ion separation properties by minimizing donnan exclusion upon ion penetration nutrient k n and p ion rejection 25 while imposing a remarkable size sieving obstruction of emps rejection ratio 91 fig 1c moreover these imidazole derivative modifiers with strong hydration ability synergistically lead to enhanced water permeance of 9 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 reaching approximately 2 fold higher magnitude than that of the pristine pa membrane and excellent antifouling anti biofouling properties fig 1b indicating their great potential in dww treatments for pollutant removal resource recovery and other applications 2 materials and

shimadzu corp kyoto japan the pore size distributions of the pristine pa and im modified membranes were calculated using eq 1 lin et al 2021 1 d r d p d d p 1 d p l n σ p 2 π e x p l n d p l n μ p 2 2 l n σ p 2 where the mean pore size µp is the same as the solute size d at a rejection ratio of 50 and the geometric standard deviation σp was calculated as the ds at the rejection ratio of 84 13 to that of dm at the rejection ratio of 50 the concentrations of microcontaminants such as trimethoprim tmp 99 diclofenac sodium salt dcf 99 and carbamazepine cbz 99 were quantified using lcms 8045

performance evaluation the performance of the membranes was evaluated using a bench scale cross flow filtration system the effective filtration area was 8 04 cm2 and the permeate and concentrate were recirculated into the feed tank prior to each set of tests the membranes were compacted using di water for 1 h until a stable permeating flux was reached all tests were conducted under a filtration pressure of 10 bar the pure water permeance was estimated using eq 2 song et al 2021 2 p w p δ v δ p δ t a where δv l represents the permeating volume after a given time period δt h δp bar represents the transmembrane pressure between the feed and permeate sides and a m2 represents the effective membrane surface area the rejection tests were conducted using a water matrix containing 1000 μg l

rejection ratio and cf and cp are the concentrations of the feed and permeate solutions respectively 2 6 antifouling anti biofouling fouling properties evaluation the antifouling properties of the membranes were evaluated using ha sa and bovine serum albumin bsa for pre compaction the membranes were filtered under a transmembrane pressure of 10 bar for 1 h and jo l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was used to

permeating flux was labeled j1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the membrane was rinsed with di water under 10 bar for another 30 min and the as obtained water permeating flux was labeled j2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the fouling ratio fr and fouling recovery ratio frr were obtained using eqs 4 and 5 as follows 4 f r 1 j 1 j 0 100 5 f r r j 2 j 0 100 where fr represents the degree of total flux loss due to the surface fouling phenomenon which can be divided into irreversible rir and reversible fouling rr the fouling ratios were obtained according to the following equations lin et al 2021 6 r r j 2 j 1 j 0 100 7 r i r j 0 j 2 j 0 100 the antibacterial activity of the prepared membranes was evaluated using two methods a static bacterial adhesion test and dynamic biofouling filtration of e coli first a colony of e coli taken from an agar dish was precultured in 20 ml of 30 g l 1 fresh tsb for 12 h at 30 c and then stirred by shaking until it reached a mid exponential growth phase the precultured bacterial suspension was diluted 50 times using a tsb medium and then cultured for 4 h at 30 c finally the cultured bacterial suspension was diluted with tsb medium to an optical density of 0 05 at 450 nm and measured using a spectrophotometer v 650 jasco japan the membranes 0 5 cm 1 0 cm were soaked in 2 ml of the bacterial suspension at ph 7 to examine the membrane bacterial adhesion property and then incubated at 30 c the samples were rinsed twice with 0 85 w w aqueous nacl solution after incubation and stained using the live dead baclight bacterial viability test kit life technologies thermo fisher scientific to fix the stained bacteria the membranes were immersed in a 2 5 v v aqueous glutaraldehyde solution for 10 min and kept in 0 85 w w aqueous nacl solution confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm fv1000d olympus corporation japan was used to qualitatively evaluate the number of attached live and dead bacterial cells for the dynamic biofouling test e coli was precultured in a tsb medium for 12 h at 30 c and then diluted with a fresh tsb medium until a final optical density of 0 05 at 450 nm measured using a spectrophotometer the same device that was used in the first method was obtained the 6 h dynamic biofouling filtration tests were conducted at 30 c with three cycles of 1 h filtration with pure water followed by 1 h filtration with a bacterial suspension after filtration the bacterial growth of the membrane samples was observed using fe sem and clsm imaging the protocols before observation followed the procedure of the static bacterial adhesion test 2 7 molecular dynamic simulations the molecular models used in this simulation were all modeled using the commercial software biovia materials studio 2018 and the molecular dynamics simulations were conducted using the same software the condensed phase optimized molecular potential for atomistic simulation studies ii compass ii force field was used for the energy minimization and md simulations two membrane models with different charges depending on the imidazole derivative were prepared the structure of the water molecules around the membrane model was investigated using the radial distribution function rdf the two membrane models used in this study are shown in fig s13 a simulation cell with a size of 31 31 31 å and periodic boundaries in all directions was prepared in the cell 1000 water molecules were included to model an aqueous phase with a density of 1 0 g cm3 in this aqueous phase the system was modeled using im n and im p fig s14 after the structural optimization of these cells md simulations were performed under the condition of constant n the number of molecules v volume t temperature and nvt ensemble for 3 0 ns at 298 k the specific information on the atomic mass density of the water molecules in near the region of the im p and im n compounds was summarized in supporting information as shown in fig s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical property characterizations of im modified membranes the imidazole derivative compounds were employed as modifiers for surface functionalization through a facile one step reaction in which each imidazole derivative unit could easily capture water molecules through surface hydration the orientations of the binding water molecules were evenly distributed on the membrane surfaces which had strong binding forces for the im modified membranes the hydration layer comprising these binding water molecules is crucial for improving water permeability and antifouling performance the nmr characterization of the as synthesized imidazole derivative im p as well as the reactants of 3 bromopropylamine hydrobromide and n methylimidazole was performed to confirm its successful development as shown in fig s1 according to these results the signals corresponding to the proton resonances from the propyl amine and imidazole ring of im p comply well with those of 3 bromopropylamine hydrobromide and n methylimidazole demonstrating the important reactants of the active compounds this result further indicates the validity of the synthesis route as reported in the literature fogarty 2013 qiao et al 2014 the nmr results of the im p and commercial im n compounds were compared to reveal the new structure of the as synthesized compounds the proton resonances of the side chain of propyl amine δ 2 29 4 56 ppm were downfield shifted relative to those of im n which can be explained by the stronger electron withdrawing effect exerted by the positively charged imidazole ring in the im p compound yen et al 2010 in addition the protons from the imidazole ring in im p δ 7 49 8 82 ppm were shifted downfield compared to those in im n δ 6 76 7 59 ppm which can be explained by the mechanism of electron deficiency resulting from the quaternization of the imidazole ring of im p xu et al 2014 specifically the resonance at 3 88 ppm was attributed to the methyl group connected to the n atom of the imidazole ring lin et al 2020 xu et al 2014 yen et al 2010 the proton resonances in the 1h nmr spectra are in accordance with the proposed structure as reported in the literature guo et al 2021 according to the ftir characterization results both the as synthesized im p and commercial im n exhibited similar spectra fig s2 where the peaks located at 2850 3025 and 3400 cm 1 were attributed to the stretching vibration of the ch2 ch3 and amine nh2 functional groups gao et al 2014 xu et al 2018 acting as active sites for subsequent covalent grafting through amidation similarly more minor characteristic peaks were assigned including ch stretching 1010 1050 cm 1 from alkyl moieties bai et al 2022 c n cn bending 1565 1195 cm 1 and c c stretching 1230 cm 1 from imidazole rings in both compounds gui et al 2020 consequently both nmr and ftir spectra confirmed the successful synthesis of the imidazole derivative im p compound pristine pa membrane substrates were developed through ip in which the excess acyl chloride from tmc was employed as active sites to react in situ with the amino groups of both imidazole derivative compounds the reaction scheme for the surface modification of the imidazole compound neutral charge im n is shown in fig s3 this acylation process was the primary mechanism to implement the functionalization by immobilizing both im p and im n which is more facile than that of the original schiff base and or michael addition reactions with a strong base and or acid in organic solvents guo et al 2021 significantly minimizing damage to the underlying substrate the reaction was verified by ftir results fig 2a and the unreacted acyl chloride peak 1718 cm 1 dong and ge 2019 yang et al 2019 disappeared after introducing the imidazole derivative compounds which were consumed by the polymerization reaction between acyl chloride and the primary amine groups thus generating a stretching vibration of amide groups located at 1670 cm 1 more characteristic peaks of typical pa membranes were obtained in which the peaks at 1530 1552 and 1478 cm 1 were related to the cc and ch stretching vibrations from the aromatic rings of the tmc monomer rahimi kashkouli et al 2020 while the peak at 1132 cm 1 was ascribed to the cn vibration of the pip monomer the main peak at 1178 cm 1 can be attributed to the scissoring vibration of so3 from the psf substrate istirokhatun et al 2020 since no significant difference could be observed between the pristine pa im n and im p membranes therefore the ultrathin thickness of the im n and im p modification layers was hardly detected by the ftir instrument the xps characterization results fig 2b show a more prominent shoulder peak located at 401 ev assigned to n from the im p and im n membranes compared to that of pristine pa this trend was more clearly observed after splitting the xps curves fig s4 and could be attributed to the introduction of ammonium and or quaternary ammonium groups from the imidazole cations furthermore the o n ratio decreased from 1 1 for the pristine pa to approximately 0 70 for the im modified pa membranes table s2 owing to the imidazole ring with a nitrogen rich but oxygen free composition the ftir and xps characterization results clearly verified the successful grafting of the imidazole derivative compounds onto the pa membrane surfaces the surface functionalization of imidazole derivative compounds enhanced the hydrophilicity of the pa membrane fig 2c with lower water contact angles of 33º and 39º for the im p and im p membranes respectively both surface modification layers exhibited better surface hydrophilicity than that of the pristine pa membrane 69º especially with increased concentration of the imidazole derivative compounds and protracted surface modification periods the enhanced water capturing capability can be attributed to the deposited imidazole rings and or quaternary ammonium with stronger ionic hydration properties wang et al 2020 besides the md simulation was constructed to reveal the underlying mechanism of pristine pa and or imidazole derivative modifier s affinities toward water molecules as shown in fig s5 as shown in fig s5a 5c the dynamic water permeation was constructed by imposing water molecules passing through the pa im n and im p structure model and the distributed atomic mass densities of water molecules during the whole permeation processes were summarized as shown in fig s5d obviously the im n and im p captured more water molecules demonstrating the larger atomic mass density of water molecules in near the region of the deposited im p and im n compounds compared to that of pristine pa furthermore the intensity of the first peak in rdf for water pa water im n and water im p was 0 22 0 46 and 0 89 respectively further indicating a stronger interaction between water and imidazole derivatives than that between water and pristine pa this result agreed with the ca measurements shown in fig 2c the surface immobilization of the imidazole derivatives influenced the surface potentials of the pa based membranes fig 2d the pristine pa membrane exhibits a negatively charged surface at a ph of 6 7 for water treatment conditions owing to the deprotonation of carboxylic groups resulting from the hydrolysis of the residual acyl chloride groups from tmc after the ip process however the grafting of the imidazole derivative compounds introduces electroneutral imidazole rings or quaternary ammonium groups via the reaction of acyl chloride sites this transforms the negatively charged pa membrane into a neutral positively charged surface liu et al 2020 compared to the pristine pa membrane featuring typical nodular structures fig 3a a relatively smooth surface structure with small nodules was obtained fig 3b 3c this can be ascribed to the modification of the imidazole derivative compounds on the pa membrane the changes in surface morphology were examined using afm characterization fig 3g 3i where the average roughness ra and root mean square roughness rms of the im modified membranes were reduced to 15 9 20 4 and 16 7 21 6 nm from the initial value of 27 9 32 7 nm for the pristine pa membrane fig s6 and table s3 by filling up the valley structure and hence smoothening the rough surface of the nascent pa membrane such a slight variation less than 10 nm in ra and rms further demonstrates the formation of an ultrathin modification layer fig 3d 3f without significantly changing the pristine pa surface microstructure 3 2 separation performances of im modified membranes the separation properties of the pristine pa and im modified membranes were systematically investigated fig s7 s10 and the optimum concentration of 1 wt compound grafting and 30 min modification time were selected for further investigation as for the im modified membrane the water permeance significantly increased from 4 3 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 for the pristine pa to 9 2 and 9 6 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 for the im n and im p membranes respectively more than 2 fold that of pristine pa under the same transmembrane pressure of 10 bar fig 4a the effects of the imidazole derivative compound grafting on the pore structures of the nf membranes were evaluated by characterizing the rejection of neutral organic molecules such as raffinose sucrose glucose and glycerol which are mainly dominated by the size exclusion mechanism as derived from the rejection curves fig 4b the mwco values of the pristine pa im p and im n membranes were 375 6 325 7 and 310 32 da respectively this suggests that imidazole derivative modification narrowed the free volume cavities of the pa membranes of which the most frequent cavity was slightly reduced from 0 58 nm for pristine pa to 0 43 and 0 46 nm for im modified membranes fig 4c grafting imidazole derivatives onto the membrane surface increased the hydrophilicity and water transport resistance with smaller pore structures however the significantly enhanced surface hydrophilicity contributes more to facilitating the rapid penetration of water molecules through the membrane bulk this is because the water dragging effect compensates for the negative influence of reduced free volumes explaining why the permeance of the im modified membrane was highly improved without a minimum sacrifice of its permeating flux to investigate the properties of the membrane separation against emps removal three typical emps tmp dcf and cbz with low mws but different valences were selected fig 5a the pristine pa membrane exhibited a high rejection of dcf of up to 97 as a result of its confined pore structures with negatively charged surface properties but a relatively reduced selectivity for tmp 82 and cbz 85 was obtained however the im p membrane showed an opposite trend of emps selectivity following the order of rejection ratios tmp 96 cbz 92 dcf 83 the positively charged tmp was more efficiently rejected owing to the stronger electrostatic repulsion of the membrane surfaces while the lower rejection ratios were attributed to the smaller size cbz and weaker donnan exclusion effect on dcf demonstrating the dominant role of electrostatic repulsion in the emp removal of nf membranes over size exclusion effect for the im n membrane the rejection ratios of the three microcontaminants ranged from 91 to 94 specifically the im modified membranes exhibited higher rejection ratios of neutrally charged cbz than the pristine pa membrane this can be explained by the tighter free volume cavities and sharpened free volume cavity distributions of the im modified membranes which favor the solute selectivity by enhanced size exclusion the membrane ionic separation properties were examined using a series of anion and cation inorganic salts which are typically prevalent in the effluent of dww applications for the removal performance of different anions fig 5b the negatively charged pa membrane exhibited a high rejection of so4 2 80 and hpo4 2 h2po4 61 2 but a lower rejection of cl 31 and no3 36 this trend agrees well with that of the positively charged im p membranes against various cations including ca2 60 4 mg2 59 k 11 5 na 8 2 and nh4 9 2 fig 5c the high rejection ratios could be explained mainly by the relatively larger sizes of divalent anions that suffered from the promoted size sieving and strengthened donnan exclusion effects however the neutrally charged im n membrane exhibited less remarkable differences between the rejection ratios of various ion solutes preserving higher amounts of nutrients for agricultural irrigation such as significantly higher h2po4 hpo4 2 24 7 but relatively low no3 23 1 nh4 16 1 and k 16 3 in the permeate this could be attributed to the charge free surface with negligible electrostatic repulsion between the ionic solutes and the membrane surfaces sahu et al 2017 the improved solute emps solute nutrient ions selectivity performs better than those of the pristine pa and im p membranes which verifies that the neutral im n membrane plays a superior role in the ultrahigh selective removal of emps while maintaining valuable target ingredients in a highly polluted environment 3 3 antifouling anti biofouling property of im n membranes three cycle filtration tests were performed to evaluate the antifouling properties of the pristine pa and im n membranes against organic foulants bsa sa and ha served as typical fouling precursors representing contaminants of proteins polysaccharides and microbial substances as shown in fig 6a 6c the pristine pa membrane exhibited a significant flux decline at the beginning of the fouling test which could be ascribed to the fouling cake and pore blockage induced by the deposition of foulants on the membrane zydney 2022 the electroneutral nf membrane with im n modification exhibited excellent antifouling properties which were mainly because of its smooth structure neutral surface charge no electrostatic adsorption and hydrophilicity furthermore the frr of the im n membrane was 91 7 85 6 and 89 4 after simple hydrophilic flushing which was significantly higher than those of the pristine pa membrane 83 3 53 and 88 treated with bsa sa and ha respectively fig s11 additionally the im n modification confers a remarkable antibacterial fouling property to the pristine pa membrane with less e coli on the membrane surface incubated and sustained for 18 h fig 6d 6e in contrast to the thriving bacterial growth of the pristine pa membrane this improved antibacterial capability of the im n membrane is mainly attributed to the ammonium groups in the imidazole ring structure which is consistent with the results in the literature he et al 2020 furthermore this tends to decrease e coli attachment to the modified membrane was due to the increase in the membrane surface hydrophilicity whereby the hydration layer retards the interactions between the bacteria and the membrane surface saeki et al 2021 yang et al 2020 dynamic biofouling filtration was performed in this study to confirm the biofouling control behavior of the im n membrane and to develop a more practical approach for biofilm formation in membrane processes fig s12 shows the permeability of the pa and im n membranes where both membranes suffered flux decline during dynamic biofouling filtration despite the decrease in the flux performance of the im n membrane its biofouling control was superior to that of the pa membrane consequently electroneutral nf membranes can simultaneously exhibit antifouling and anti biofouling properties which holds great promise for high performance separation in complex systems 3 4 mechanism implications the absorption and diffusion of water molecules into a highly hydrophilic surface are considered to confer high water permeance as previously demonstrated fig 2b the imidazole derivative modification layer exhibited better surface hydrophilicity compared to the pristine pa membrane owing to the higher surface free energy fig 7b promoting the water capturing capabilities in the surface region of the membranes wang et al 2020 furthermore an md simulation was conducted to determine how imidazole derivative compounds influence water transport through the membrane in this work the water binding capabilities of the pip tmc and im n segments in the membranes are denoted as i tmccooh monomer ii pip monomer and iii imidazole ring as shown in fig 7a through the rdf analysis the amounts of water molecules around segments i ii and iii were calculated to be 1 44 1 09 and 0 01 in the first coordination layer r 2 3 å respectively fig 7d furthermore the rdf results show that the peak value of i h2o 1 59 is much higher than that of ii h2o 1 09 and iii h2o 0 83 as shown in fig 7c the results indicated that the water bonding wb capabilities of different segments were in the order of wbi wbii wbiii in accordance with the binding energies of segments i ii and iii that are in the sequence ei eii eiii as shown in fig 7d based on these data fig 7e illustrates the mechanism of high water permeability which can be ascribed to the ultrathin imidazole derivative modification layer with negligible resistance capturing larger amounts of water molecules permeating into the membrane bulk to transport through in comparison the pristine pa membrane captured fewer water molecules to permeate into the membrane bulk with lower water permeance owing to its relatively hydrophobic property 4 conclusion novel imidazole derivative compounds were used to grant the traditional pa membrane better properties for nf water reclamation through changes in the microstructure and chemistry of the proposed compounds the underlying mechanism for the improved separation and antifouling anti biofouling properties of the im modified membranes were elucidated the presence of a neutral surface charge was essential to achieve the charge shielding effect no electrostatic attraction repulsion that underpinned the passing through of nutrients of ionic solutes while imposing effective obstruction on micropollutants within the effluent of dww treatment moreover the efficient control over the deposition of ultrathin im n membranes with high hydrophilicity facilitated the rapid passage of water molecules and endowed the membrane with excellent antifouling antibacterial fouling properties in

15162,domestic wastewater dww contains a reservoir of nutrients such as nitrogen potassium and phosphorus however emerging micropollutants emps hinder its applications in resource recovery in this study a novel class of nanofiltration nf membranes was developed it enabled the efficient removal of harmful emp constituents while preserving valuable nutrients in the permeate neutral im n and positively charged im p imidazole derivative compounds have been used to chemically functionalize pristine polyamide pa membranes to synchronously inhibit the hydrolysis of residual acyl chloride and promote their amination owing to their distinct properties these im modifiers can custom build the membrane physicochemical properties and structures to benefit the nf process in dww treatment the electroneutral nf membrane exhibited ultrahigh solute solute selectivity by minimizing the donnan effects on ion penetration k n and p ions rejection 25 while imposing remarkable size sieving obstruction against emps rejection ratio 91 moreover the hydrophilic im modifier synergistically led to enhanced water permeance of 9 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 reaching a 2 fold higher magnitude than that of the pristine pa membrane along with excellent antifouling antibacterial fouling properties this study may provide a paradigm shift in membrane technology to convert wastewater streams into valuable water and nutrient resources graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanofiltration imidazole derivative compound electroneutral membrane interfacial polymerization solute solute selectivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the escalating global food consumption demands sustainable agricultural management to supply clean safe and adequate food modern agriculture relies upon the usage of fertilizers rich in nitrogen n potassium k and phosphorus p international fertilizer association forecasted that the global demand for k2o n and p2o5 will be increased to 41 2 114 5 and 52 5 megatonne mt respectively by 2025 chang et al 2022 the main employed procedure for producing most n fertilizers harber bosch is energy intensive with a significant carbon footprint consuming nearly 1 of the global energy supply xie et al 2016 at current consumption rates the reserve of potash which is a non renewable resource is estimated to get exhausted in 93 years while phosphate rock reserves are estimated to be depleted within the next 100 years walan et al 2014 under such circumstances domestic wastewater dww has gained considerable attention as an alternative to the recovery of fertilizer resources approximately 30 and 15 of the n and p respectively applied as fertilizers end up in dww which has the potential to serve nearly half of the global market johansson et al 2017 johansson et al 2019 small et al 2019 currently nearly 80 of n is transferred to nitrogen by microbes generating high volumes of wet sludge by products approximately 90 of p is lost after precipitation creating solid waste or minerals that cannot be absorbed by plants li et al 2015 all wastes are dried and require final disposal in landfills accounting for 30 50 of dww treatment costs ansari et al 2017 li et al 2015 moreover most nutrient resource recovery technologies target side streams containing less than 30 of the nutrients in their effluents small et al 2019 wielemaker et al 2019 by utilizing proper treatment processes these valuable elements including k n and p can be separated from dww providing reliable nutrient resources without using extra energy therefore the development of a new technology that enables efficient nutrient resource recovery from dww mainstream is highly desired however the presence of emerging micropollutants emps tends to degenerate the utilization of dww for agricultural irrigation luo et al 2014 consequently the selective removal of harmful emps while preserving nutrient constituents is of paramount importance for resource recovery from dww treatments nanofiltration nf has become the most promising technology to address the severe shortage of nutrient recovery through the dww process without adding excessive chemicals such as coagulants thereby reducing the uncertainties of the produced water nf membranes play an increasingly important role in differentiating organic compounds and inorganic salts by the synergistic effects of size exclusion molecular weight cut off mwco of 200 1000 da and electrostatic repulsion donnan effect teow et al 2021 however owing to the small molecular weights of emps such as trimethoprim tmp 290 da carbamazepine cbz 236 da and diclofenac dcf 318 da and similar charged states at neutral ph conditions to nf membrane surfaces the existing polyamide pa based nf membranes still struggle to achieve high fractionation of emps while enhancing target nutrient ion permeation guo et al 2019 commercial nf membranes have been used to separate po4 2 from sewage sludge but their inhomogeneous pore size distributions with tight structures lead to an undesired high rejection ratio lópez et al 2022 some studies reported lower primary phosphorous average rejection capability 40 however they still maintained high rejection against the other metal cation nutrients 85 remmen et al 2019 soyekwo et al 2019 thong et al 2016 under highly acidic ph values 0 7 2 owing to the strengthened donnan exclusion effect another recently published study fabricated nanofiltration membranes with less negatively charged properties the membrane showed promise in solute nutrient ions solute polyfluoroalkyl substances separation zhao et al 2022b however the precise separation of nutrients from coexisting emp contaminants has not yet been achieved and the solute solute selectivity of these important species requires ultrahighly selective nf membranes to realize cost effective and valuable resource recovery the performance of the solute solute separation between nutrient ions k nh4 no3 h2po4 hpo4 2 and emps tmp cbz and dcf under neutral ph conditions is primarily dependent on the properties of the pa selective layer most reported pa nf membranes are electrically charged cheng et al 2015 tang et al 2022 owing to the formation of surface functional groups i e carboxyl or amino following the interfacial polymerization ip process istirokhatun et al 2022 zhao et al 2022a the negatively or positively charged states of nf membranes lead to the high rejection of nutrient anions or cations fan et al 2018 but the unsatisfactory selectivity of emps with counter ionic valence consequently an electroneutral nf membrane can theoretically achieve a comparable membrane rejection capability against various electrically charged solutes which is favorable for achieving excellent overall removal of emps with varied charges in the feed water zhao et al 2017 furthermore the nf membrane should possess precise pore sizes that can efficiently fractionate low molecular weight emps from relatively small nutrient ions within an extremely small pore range of 0 3 0 4 nm table s1 a sharp pore size distribution with a tightly uniform pore structure plays a key role in ensuring efficient separation at the angstrom or even sub angstrom level which can usually be achieved using materials with strictly controlled free volume cavities lu et al 2020 zheng et al 2016 however all these membranes are only developed based on complicated reaction processes with increased expenses consequently the development of a neutral nf membrane with ultrahigh selectivity which mainly utilizes size exclusion rather than donnan equilibrium holds great promise for treating high pollution dww effluents rich in nutrient ions however little progress has been achieved to date a new class of imidazole derivatives of n 3 aminopropyl imidazole has been developed as grafting monomers to achieve membrane surface functionalization sun et al bai et al 2022 constructed an acid resistant nf membrane with highly efficient separation of metal ions at lower ph values of 1 3 after modification with im n compounds kim et al tuan et al 2018 grafted poly arylene ether ketone s with pendant imidazolium groups to fabricate an anion exchange membrane and found that an improved anion conductivity could be obtained by introducing more monomers after their quaternization treatment with ch3i active amine groups were further employed to develop nf membranes with positively charged properties by blending with piperazine pip monomers to strengthen the donnan effect against metal ionic solutes jin et al 2020 consequently it can be concluded that the imidazole derivatives were chosen as modification monomers because of the following advantages 1 the highly active primary amine groups can react with acyl chloride groups of tmc forming covalent bonds and ensuring the validity of the modification 2 only one functional group amine can participate in the grafting reaction to avoid the formation of excess polymer network to a minimum extent without blocking pore channels 3 the imidazole groups can be easily protonated through quaternization treatment to further adjust the membrane surface charge properties for specific separation purposes in this study an ultrahighly selective membrane was fabricated through the in situ modification of imidazole derivative compounds which have a neutral and positive charge with the advantages of design flexibility high stability and environmental friendliness reis et al 2015 anchoring compounds with distinct properties onto the pa membrane surface through a fast one step reaction under mild conditions inhibited the hydrolysis of acyl chloride groups into carboxyl groups thereby reducing the negative membrane charge and identifying the factors that govern membrane separation fig 1a meanwhile highly packed imidazole derivative compounds ims could act as an effective nanofluidic platform to precisely regulate pore structures without compromising water permeability as a result the proposed electroneutral nf membrane exhibited excellent solute emps solute nutrient ion separation properties by minimizing donnan exclusion upon ion penetration nutrient k n and p ion rejection 25 while imposing a remarkable size sieving obstruction of emps rejection ratio 91 fig 1c moreover these imidazole derivative modifiers with strong hydration ability synergistically lead to enhanced water permeance of 9 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 reaching approximately 2 fold higher magnitude than that of the pristine pa membrane and excellent antifouling anti biofouling properties fig 1b indicating their great potential in dww treatments for pollutant removal resource recovery and other applications 2 materials and

preparation of pa nf membranes and im modified membranes the tfc pa nf membranes were fabricated through the ip process according to the reference istirokhatun et al 2020 the aqueous solution was

shimadzu corp kyoto japan the pore size distributions of the pristine pa and im modified membranes were calculated using eq 1 lin et al 2021 1 d r d p d d p 1 d p l n σ p 2 π e x p l n d p l n μ p 2 2 l n σ p 2 where the mean pore size µp is the same as the solute size d at a rejection ratio of 50 and the geometric standard deviation σp was calculated as the ds at the rejection ratio of 84 13 to that of dm at the rejection ratio of 50 the concentrations of microcontaminants such as trimethoprim tmp 99 diclofenac sodium salt dcf 99 and carbamazepine cbz 99 were quantified using lcms 8045

performance evaluation the performance of the membranes was evaluated using a bench scale cross flow filtration system the effective filtration area was 8 04 cm2 and the permeate and concentrate were recirculated into the feed tank prior to each set of tests the membranes were compacted using di water for 1 h until a stable permeating flux was reached all tests were conducted under a filtration pressure of 10 bar the pure water permeance was estimated using eq 2 song et al 2021 2 p w p δ v δ p δ t a where δv l represents the permeating volume after a given time period δt h δp bar represents the transmembrane pressure between the feed and permeate sides and a m2 represents the effective membrane surface area the rejection tests were conducted using a water matrix containing 1000 μg l

feed water was adjusted to 6 0 zhao et al 2021 eq 3 was used to calculate the rejection ratios of salts and organic compounds istirokhatun et al 2022 3 r d c f c p c f 100 where r d in represents the rejection ratio and cf and cp are the concentrations of the feed and permeate solutions respectively 2 6 antifouling anti biofouling fouling properties evaluation the antifouling properties of the membranes were evaluated using ha sa and bovine serum albumin bsa for pre compaction the membranes were filtered under a transmembrane pressure of 10 bar for 1 h and jo l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was used to label the initial water permeating flux the ha sa bsa solution 200 ppm containing cacl2 1 mm was used to replace the feed solution for another 1 h filtration under 10 bar and then the resultant water permeating flux was labeled j1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the membrane was rinsed with di water under 10 bar for another 30 min and the as obtained water permeating flux was labeled j2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the fouling ratio fr and fouling recovery ratio frr were obtained using eqs 4 and 5 as follows 4 f r 1 j 1 j 0 100 5 f r r j 2 j 0 100 where fr represents the degree of total flux loss due to the surface fouling phenomenon which can be divided into irreversible rir and reversible fouling rr the fouling ratios were obtained according to the following equations lin et al 2021 6 r r j 2 j 1 j 0 100 7 r i r j 0 j 2 j 0 100 the antibacterial activity of the prepared membranes was evaluated using two methods a static bacterial adhesion test and dynamic biofouling filtration of e coli first a colony of e coli taken from an agar dish was precultured in 20 ml of 30 g l 1 fresh tsb for 12 h at 30 c and then stirred by shaking until it reached a mid exponential growth phase the precultured bacterial suspension was diluted 50 times using a tsb medium and then cultured for 4 h at 30 c finally the cultured bacterial suspension was diluted with tsb medium to an optical density of 0 05 at 450 nm and measured using a spectrophotometer v 650 jasco japan the membranes 0 5 cm 1 0 cm were soaked in 2 ml of the bacterial suspension at ph 7 to examine the membrane bacterial adhesion property and then incubated at 30 c the samples were rinsed twice with 0 85 w w aqueous nacl solution after incubation and stained using the live dead baclight bacterial viability test kit life technologies thermo fisher scientific to fix the stained bacteria the membranes were immersed in a 2 5 v v aqueous glutaraldehyde solution for 10 min and kept in 0 85 w w aqueous nacl solution confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm fv1000d olympus corporation japan was used to qualitatively evaluate the number of attached live and dead bacterial cells for the dynamic biofouling test e coli was precultured in a tsb medium for 12 h at 30 c and then diluted with a fresh tsb medium until a final optical density of 0 05 at 450 nm measured using a spectrophotometer the same device that was used in the first method was obtained the 6 h dynamic biofouling filtration tests were conducted at 30 c with three cycles of 1 h filtration with pure water followed by 1 h filtration with a bacterial suspension after filtration the bacterial growth of the membrane samples was observed using fe sem and clsm imaging the protocols before observation followed the procedure of the static bacterial adhesion test 2 7 molecular dynamic simulations the molecular models used in this simulation were all modeled using the commercial software biovia materials studio 2018 and the molecular dynamics simulations were conducted using the same software the condensed phase optimized molecular potential for atomistic simulation studies ii compass ii force field was used for the energy minimization and md simulations two membrane models with different charges depending on the imidazole derivative were prepared the structure of the water molecules around the membrane model was investigated using the radial distribution function rdf the two membrane models used in this study are shown in fig s13 a simulation cell with a size of 31 31 31 å and periodic boundaries in all directions was prepared in the cell 1000 water molecules were included to model an aqueous phase with a density of 1 0 g cm3 in this aqueous phase the system was modeled using im n and im p fig s14 after the structural optimization of these cells md simulations were performed under the condition of constant n the number of molecules v volume t temperature and nvt ensemble for 3 0 ns at 298 k the specific information on the atomic mass density of the water molecules in near the region of the im p and im n compounds was summarized in supporting information as shown in fig s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical property characterizations of im modified membranes the imidazole derivative compounds were employed as modifiers for surface functionalization through a facile one step reaction in which each imidazole derivative unit could easily capture water molecules through surface hydration the orientations of the binding water molecules were evenly distributed on the membrane surfaces which had strong binding forces for the im modified membranes the hydration layer comprising these binding water molecules is crucial for improving water permeability and antifouling performance the nmr characterization of the as synthesized imidazole derivative im p as well as the reactants of 3 bromopropylamine hydrobromide and n methylimidazole was performed to confirm its successful development as shown in fig s1 according to these results the signals corresponding to the proton resonances from the propyl amine and imidazole ring of im p comply well with those of 3 bromopropylamine hydrobromide and n methylimidazole demonstrating the important reactants of the active compounds this result further indicates the validity of the synthesis route as reported in the literature fogarty 2013 qiao et al 2014 the nmr results of the im p and commercial im n compounds were compared to reveal the new structure of the as synthesized compounds the proton resonances of the side chain of propyl amine δ 2 29 4 56 ppm were downfield shifted relative to those of im n which can be explained by the stronger electron withdrawing effect exerted by the positively charged imidazole ring in the im p compound yen et al 2010 in addition the protons from the imidazole ring in im p δ 7 49 8 82 ppm were shifted downfield compared to those in im n δ 6 76 7 59 ppm which can be explained by the mechanism of electron deficiency resulting from the quaternization of the imidazole ring of im p xu et al 2014 specifically the resonance at 3 88 ppm was attributed to the methyl group connected to the n atom of the imidazole ring lin et al 2020 xu et al 2014 yen et al 2010 the proton resonances in the 1h nmr spectra are in accordance with the proposed structure as reported in the literature guo et al 2021 according to the ftir characterization results both the as synthesized im p and commercial im n exhibited similar spectra fig s2 where the peaks located at 2850 3025 and 3400 cm 1 were attributed to the stretching vibration of the ch2 ch3 and amine nh2 functional groups gao et al 2014 xu et al 2018 acting as active sites for subsequent covalent grafting through amidation similarly more minor characteristic peaks were assigned including ch stretching 1010 1050 cm 1 from alkyl moieties bai et al 2022 c n cn bending 1565 1195 cm 1 and c c stretching 1230 cm 1 from imidazole rings in both compounds gui et al 2020 consequently both nmr and ftir spectra confirmed the successful synthesis of the imidazole derivative im p compound pristine pa membrane substrates were developed through ip in which the excess acyl chloride from tmc was employed as active sites to react in situ with the amino groups of both imidazole derivative compounds the reaction scheme for the surface modification of the imidazole compound neutral charge im n is shown in fig s3 this acylation process was the primary mechanism to implement the functionalization by immobilizing both im p and im n which is more facile than that of the original schiff base and or michael addition reactions with a strong base and or acid in organic solvents guo et al 2021 significantly minimizing damage to the underlying substrate the reaction was verified by ftir results fig 2a and the unreacted acyl chloride peak 1718 cm 1 dong and ge 2019 yang et al 2019 disappeared after introducing the imidazole derivative compounds which were consumed by the polymerization reaction between acyl chloride and the primary amine groups thus generating a stretching vibration of amide groups located at 1670 cm 1 more characteristic peaks of typical pa membranes were obtained in which the peaks at 1530 1552 and 1478 cm 1 were related to the cc and ch stretching vibrations from the aromatic rings of the tmc monomer rahimi kashkouli et al 2020 while the peak at 1132 cm 1 was ascribed to the cn vibration of the pip monomer the main peak at 1178 cm 1 can be attributed to the scissoring vibration of so3 from the psf substrate istirokhatun et al 2020 since no significant difference could be observed between the pristine pa im n and im p membranes therefore the ultrathin thickness of the im n and im p modification layers was hardly detected by the ftir instrument the xps characterization results fig 2b show a more prominent shoulder peak located at 401 ev assigned to n from the im p and im n membranes compared to that of pristine pa this trend was more clearly observed after splitting the xps curves fig s4 and could be attributed to the introduction of ammonium and or quaternary ammonium groups from the imidazole cations furthermore the o n ratio decreased from 1 1 for the pristine pa to approximately 0 70 for the im modified pa membranes table s2 owing to the imidazole ring with a nitrogen rich but oxygen free composition the ftir and xps characterization results clearly verified the successful grafting of the imidazole derivative compounds onto the pa membrane surfaces the surface functionalization of imidazole derivative compounds enhanced the hydrophilicity of the pa membrane fig 2c with lower water contact angles of 33º and 39º for the im p and im p membranes respectively both surface modification layers exhibited better surface hydrophilicity than that of the pristine pa membrane 69º especially with increased concentration of the imidazole derivative compounds and protracted surface modification periods the enhanced water capturing capability can be attributed to the deposited imidazole rings and or quaternary ammonium with stronger ionic hydration properties wang et al 2020 besides the md simulation was constructed to reveal the underlying mechanism of pristine pa and or imidazole derivative modifier s affinities toward water molecules as shown in fig s5 as shown in fig s5a 5c the dynamic water permeation was constructed by imposing water molecules passing through the pa im n and im p structure model and the distributed atomic mass densities of water molecules during the whole permeation processes were summarized as shown in fig s5d obviously the im n and im p captured more water molecules demonstrating the larger atomic mass density of water molecules in near the region of the deposited im p and im n compounds compared to that of pristine pa furthermore the intensity of the first peak in rdf for water pa water im n and water im p was 0 22 0 46 and 0 89 respectively further indicating a stronger interaction between water and imidazole derivatives than that between water and pristine pa this result agreed with the ca measurements shown in fig 2c the surface immobilization of the imidazole derivatives influenced the surface potentials of the pa based membranes fig 2d the pristine pa membrane exhibits a negatively charged surface at a ph of 6 7 for water treatment conditions owing to the deprotonation of carboxylic groups resulting from the hydrolysis of the residual acyl chloride groups from tmc after the ip process however the grafting of the imidazole derivative compounds introduces electroneutral imidazole rings or quaternary ammonium groups via the reaction of acyl chloride sites this transforms the negatively charged pa membrane into a neutral positively charged surface liu et al 2020 compared to the pristine pa membrane featuring typical nodular structures fig 3a a relatively smooth surface structure with small nodules was obtained fig 3b 3c this can be ascribed to the modification of the imidazole derivative compounds on the pa membrane the changes in surface morphology were examined using afm characterization fig 3g 3i where the average roughness ra and root mean square roughness rms of the im modified membranes were reduced to 15 9 20 4 and 16 7 21 6 nm from the initial value of 27 9 32 7 nm for the pristine pa membrane fig s6 and table s3 by filling up the valley structure and hence smoothening the rough surface of the nascent pa membrane such a slight variation less than 10 nm in ra and rms further demonstrates the formation of an ultrathin modification layer fig 3d 3f without significantly changing the pristine pa surface microstructure 3 2 separation performances of im modified membranes the separation properties of the pristine pa and im modified membranes were systematically investigated fig s7 s10 and the optimum concentration of 1 wt compound grafting and 30 min modification time were selected for further investigation as for the im modified membrane the water permeance significantly increased from 4 3 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 for the pristine pa to 9 2 and 9 6 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 for the im n and im p membranes respectively more than 2 fold that of pristine pa under the same transmembrane pressure of 10 bar fig 4a the effects of the imidazole derivative compound grafting on the pore structures of the nf membranes were evaluated by characterizing the rejection of neutral organic molecules such as raffinose sucrose glucose and glycerol which are mainly dominated by the size exclusion mechanism as derived from the rejection curves fig 4b the mwco values of the pristine pa im p and im n membranes were 375 6 325 7 and 310 32 da respectively this suggests that imidazole derivative modification narrowed the free volume cavities of the pa membranes of which the most frequent cavity was slightly reduced from 0 58 nm for pristine pa to 0 43 and 0 46 nm for im modified membranes fig 4c grafting imidazole derivatives onto the membrane surface increased the hydrophilicity and water transport resistance with smaller pore structures however the significantly enhanced surface hydrophilicity contributes more to facilitating the rapid penetration of water molecules through the membrane bulk this is because the water dragging effect compensates for the negative influence of reduced free volumes explaining why the permeance of the im modified membrane was highly improved without a minimum sacrifice of its permeating flux to investigate the properties of the membrane separation against emps removal three typical emps tmp dcf and cbz with low mws but different valences were selected fig 5a the pristine pa membrane exhibited a high rejection of dcf of up to 97 as a result of its confined pore structures with negatively charged surface properties but a relatively reduced selectivity for tmp 82 and cbz 85 was obtained however the im p membrane showed an opposite trend of emps selectivity following the order of rejection ratios tmp 96 cbz 92 dcf 83 the positively charged tmp was more efficiently rejected owing to the stronger electrostatic repulsion of the membrane surfaces while the lower rejection ratios were attributed to the smaller size cbz and weaker donnan exclusion effect on dcf demonstrating the dominant role of electrostatic repulsion in the emp removal of nf membranes over size exclusion effect for the im n membrane the rejection ratios of the three microcontaminants ranged from 91 to 94 specifically the im modified membranes exhibited higher rejection ratios of neutrally charged cbz than the pristine pa membrane this can be explained by the tighter free volume cavities and sharpened free volume cavity distributions of the im modified membranes which favor the solute selectivity by enhanced size exclusion the membrane ionic separation properties were examined using a series of anion and cation inorganic salts which are typically prevalent in the effluent of dww applications for the removal performance of different anions fig 5b the negatively charged pa membrane exhibited a high rejection of so4 2 80 and hpo4 2 h2po4 61 2 but a lower rejection of cl 31 and no3 36 this trend agrees well with that of the positively charged im p membranes against various cations including ca2 60 4 mg2 59 k 11 5 na 8 2 and nh4 9 2 fig 5c the high rejection ratios could be explained mainly by the relatively larger sizes of divalent anions that suffered from the promoted size sieving and strengthened donnan exclusion effects however the neutrally charged im n membrane exhibited less remarkable differences between the rejection ratios of various ion solutes preserving higher amounts of nutrients for agricultural irrigation such as significantly higher h2po4 hpo4 2 24 7 but relatively low no3 23 1 nh4 16 1 and k 16 3 in the permeate this could be attributed to the charge free surface with negligible electrostatic repulsion between the ionic solutes and the membrane surfaces sahu et al 2017 the improved solute emps solute nutrient ions selectivity performs better than those of the pristine pa and im p membranes which verifies that the neutral im n membrane plays a superior role in the ultrahigh selective removal of emps while maintaining valuable target ingredients in a highly polluted environment 3 3 antifouling anti biofouling property of im n membranes three cycle filtration tests were performed to evaluate the antifouling properties of the pristine pa and im n membranes against organic foulants bsa sa and ha served as typical fouling precursors representing contaminants of proteins polysaccharides and microbial substances as shown in fig 6a 6c the pristine pa membrane exhibited a significant flux decline at the beginning of the fouling test which could be ascribed to the fouling cake and pore blockage induced by the deposition of foulants on the membrane zydney 2022 the electroneutral nf membrane with im n modification exhibited excellent antifouling properties which were mainly because of its smooth structure neutral surface charge no electrostatic adsorption and hydrophilicity furthermore the frr of the im n membrane was 91 7 85 6 and 89 4 after simple hydrophilic flushing which was significantly higher than those of the pristine pa membrane 83 3 53 and 88 treated with bsa sa and ha respectively fig s11 additionally the im n modification confers a remarkable antibacterial fouling property to the pristine pa membrane with less e coli on the membrane surface incubated and sustained for 18 h fig 6d 6e in contrast to the thriving bacterial growth of the pristine pa membrane this improved antibacterial capability of the im n membrane is mainly attributed to the ammonium groups in the imidazole ring structure which is consistent with the results in the literature he et al 2020 furthermore this tends to decrease e coli attachment to the modified membrane was due to the increase in the membrane surface hydrophilicity whereby the hydration layer retards the interactions between the bacteria and the membrane surface saeki et al 2021 yang et al 2020 dynamic biofouling filtration was performed in this study to confirm the biofouling control behavior of the im n membrane and to develop a more practical approach for biofilm formation in membrane processes fig s12 shows the permeability of the pa and im n membranes where both membranes suffered flux decline during dynamic biofouling filtration despite the decrease in the flux performance of the im n membrane its biofouling control was superior to that of the pa membrane consequently electroneutral nf membranes can simultaneously exhibit antifouling and anti biofouling properties which holds great promise for high performance separation in complex systems 3 4 mechanism implications the absorption and diffusion of water molecules into a highly hydrophilic surface are considered to confer high water permeance as previously demonstrated fig 2b the imidazole derivative modification layer exhibited better surface hydrophilicity compared to the pristine pa membrane owing to the higher surface free energy fig 7b promoting the water capturing capabilities in the surface region of the membranes wang et al 2020 furthermore an md simulation was conducted to determine how imidazole derivative compounds influence water transport through the membrane in this work the water binding capabilities of the pip tmc and im n segments in the membranes are denoted as i tmccooh monomer ii pip monomer and iii imidazole ring as shown in fig 7a through the rdf analysis the amounts of water molecules around segments i ii and iii were calculated to be 1 44 1 09 and 0 01 in the first coordination layer r 2 3 å respectively fig 7d furthermore the rdf results show that the peak value of i h2o 1 59 is much higher than that of ii h2o 1 09 and iii h2o 0 83 as shown in fig 7c the results indicated that the water bonding wb capabilities of different segments were in the order of wbi wbii wbiii in accordance with the binding energies of segments i ii and iii that are in the sequence ei eii eiii as shown in fig 7d based on these data fig 7e illustrates the mechanism of high water permeability which can be ascribed to the ultrathin imidazole derivative modification layer with negligible resistance capturing larger amounts of water molecules permeating into the membrane bulk to transport through in comparison the pristine pa membrane captured fewer water molecules to permeate into the membrane bulk with lower water permeance owing to its relatively hydrophobic property 4 conclusion novel imidazole derivative compounds were used to grant the traditional pa membrane better properties for nf water reclamation through changes in the microstructure and chemistry of the proposed compounds the underlying mechanism for the improved separation and antifouling anti biofouling properties of the im modified membranes were elucidated the presence of a neutral surface charge was essential to achieve the charge shielding effect no electrostatic attraction repulsion that underpinned the passing through of nutrients of ionic solutes while imposing effective obstruction on micropollutants within the effluent of dww treatment moreover the efficient control over the deposition of ultrathin im n membranes with high hydrophilicity facilitated the rapid passage of water molecules and endowed the membrane with excellent antifouling antibacterial fouling properties in

international data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction humanity is facing a global water crisis of growing water scarcity along with quality issues this is largely caused by a steep increase in the world s population and in fresh water demand since the 1950 s including unsustainable extraction of ground water and poor infrastructure in water supply systems especially in low and middle income countries lmics bouabid and louis 2015 whitmee et al 2015 climate change crisis is expected to exacerbate water stress through decline of renewable surface water and ground water resources projected in most dry subtropical regions ipcc 2014 this leads to unprecedented and urgent pressures to ensure sustainable drinking water access for the present and future generations in many parts of the world chemical pollution of drinking water is a global growing problem that has received limited attention damania et al 2019 compared to water access sanitation and hygiene wash issues which are routinely monitored by the who unicef since 1990 the united nations un sustainable development goal sdg 6 urges to guarantee universal access to safe drinking water free

particularly in lmics chemical hazards in drinking water are multiple and from many origins e g nitrate from intensive agriculture and farming arsenic or fluoride from natural sources industrial chemicals from untreated effluents as well as chemical by products formed during disinfection processes to inactivate pathogens disinfection of drinking water is unquestionably necessary to provide microbiologically safe drinking water however disinfection by products dbps are unintentionally generated richardson et al 2007 virtually the entire population in developed countries is exposed to dbps through ingestion inhalation or dermal absorption when drinking or using municipal tap water for showering washing dishes or swimming in pools villanueva et al 2015 based on animal data the international agency for research on cancer iarc classifies chloroform and other dbps as possible human carcinogens iarc 2012 likewise bladder cancer has been consistently associated with long term dbps exposure in epidemiologic studies costet et al 2011b villanueva et al 2004 trihalomethanes thms are generally the most abundant dbp class formed in water treated with chlorine the most widely used water disinfectant and are used as a dbp marker the extent of dbp formation is impacted by precursor levels i e the amount of organic and inorganic materials occurring in the raw water that are transformed by the disinfectants to dbps the nature of the treatment disinfection processes and the dbp regulations who guidelines for individual thms are 300 μg l for chloroform 100 μg l for bromoform 100 μg l for dibromochloromethane and 60 μg l for bromodichloromethane who 2022a the maximum contaminant level mcl established by the european union eu is 100 μg l for total thms i e the sum of chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform ec 2020 although a few member states may have more stringent regulations prior to 2001 in the united states us the mcl for total

in the average total thm occurrence for the highest 5 of systems serving 100 000 people across 44 us states compared to 1997 1998 seidel et al 2017 worldwide centralized information on regulation monitoring and thm measurements in drinking water is missing or is scarce and scattered and beyond europe evlampidou et al 2020 and the us weisman et al 2022 there are no systematic studies reporting these data in this context and expanding a preceding eu based thm assessment evlampidou et al 2020 we conducted a global evaluation of chemical quality of drinking water focusing on thms and including the most populated countries worldwide we report the current state of knowledge on the regulatory status and routine monitoring practice of thms as well as thm occurrence data worldwide 2 methods 2 1 study design and population during 2017 2020 we performed a worldwide ecological descriptive study using existing and available data on regulations and data on thm concentrations from 1997 to 2020 we included countries presented in the eu based thm assessment evlampidou et al 2020 and expanded on the missing european countries we additionally selected the most populated countries within each of the un regions 2015 revision in descending order until 75 coverage for the specific un region was achieved un 2015 this initial list was expanded to include countries mentioned in the who report on drinking water standards and thm regulations worldwide who 2021 and countries where we had personal contacts or encountered relevant information during the literature review countries with active war at the time of data collection were not included we finally targeted 120 countries tables 1 4 accounting for 6 993 800 182 inhabitants and representing approximately 94 of the world population in 2016 ihme 2016 2 2 data collection questionnaire used in personal communications we designed a questionnaire to collect data on thm regulations and monitoring practice water source and disinfection methods supplementary material fig 1 the questionnaire also ascertained the institution person providing the information reporting year and geographic region population served and maximum permissible level for thms according to the country s regulation maximum concentration level mcl or guidelines we created a template database to compile data for any year between 2010 and 2016 on an annual average standard deviation sd and number of water samples tested for total thms chloroform bromodichloromethane chlorodibromomethane and bromoform between october 2017 and february 2018 we sent the study questionnaire to experts in national agencies ministries of health institutes of public health water agencies etc universities and research centres with responsibilities in the maintenance or generation of data on drinking water quality where possible the raw thm data was requested and the template database provided literature review and gray literature for countries where experts were not identified or declined to participate we explored other data sources such as online open data and public reports and by personal communications we performed a literature review according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma and expanded the study period to 1997 2020 we aimed to identify drinking water regulations and open online monitoring reports with thm measurements at the tap distribution systems or water treatment plants from official websites e g ministry of health municipality etc water companies and or private laboratories secondly we performed a literature search for published peer reviewed scientific articles and gray literature including masters or phd theses using the online databases pubmed google scholar mendeley and google we used no restriction to any language and used these keywords in english language country name and drinking water or potable water or water quality and trihalomethanes or thms or disinfection by products or chlorination by products or chloroform when performing this search in google we also used the french spanish and portuguese translation of the keywords when encountering websites in the local language we used the google automatic translation service to translate the relevant text or page into english when necessary the literature review on china was conducted by a native chinese speaker we included articles and reports when thm data were based on actual measurements but we excluded them when only modelled thm data were provided for the data extraction and entry we used an adapted extended version of the template thm database and created separate country based datasets we looked for drinking water regulations in a broad sense i e including either guidelines non binding recommendations or binding maximum contaminant levels in addition to the above we used the keywords guidelines or legislation or law or regulations or order for information extraction and entry we created a thm country regulation database due to the ecological design of the study and the anonymity of data ethics approval was not sought 2 3 data analysis to estimate country thm indices and population coverage based on data from questionnaires for the estimation of thm descriptive statistics and population coverage we used data as provided or performed additional analysis including application of population weights whenever possible the procedure was as follows when only country wide average thm concentrations and population size were available through our data sources we used the country average thm and population served coverage data as was when raw data were available and measurements were below the detection limit dl we assigned half the value of the reporting laboratory s dl when only data for the four thms was available we calculated total thms by summing the individual components we used the mean values of thms instead of median values despite the skewedness of some data because many countries provided mean values and published literature commonly reports means for the minimum and maximum values we used the non weighted thm levels to show the actual range we calculated the country population weighted average thm level and standard deviation sd when area specific e g localities municipalities regions etc thm data were available which we then assigned to the whole country for the calculation of the individual weights the country population weighted thm average and the population served coverage we used the country and reporting areas population figures provided either by the national experts or from census data for the reporting year or if more than one year data was available closest to the mid point reporting period additionally for the estimation of the population served coverage we primarily used country level population size in 2016 from the global burden of disease 2016 study ihme 2016 and secondarily either information from specific country request or from the national statistical offices or from wikipedia using the search term demographics of country name 13 countries based on data from literature review we obtained or calculated average thm estimates for specific reporting areas from data available in the literature online open data public reports scientific research articles firstly all identified articles and reports were entered into an excel sheet with the following information country name authors publication date article title journal reporting year study area population covered type of water e g surface water ground water mixed and disinfection method secondly the full text of the article was assessed and information was extracted and entered in another excel sheet including reported mean standard deviation sd range minimum maximum and median for total thms chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and or bromoform in each study area in a third step thm indices were entered in a table to summarize the final thm indices per country province or city if more than one study was conducted in the area and in the same water network the more recent published thm mean values were included and the average thm value was calculated for the area from all studies published in the same year articles that did not report thm mean values were excluded in the third step the extraction steps were checked by two authors to assess whether the information in the papers was accurately extracted and the articles met the inclusion criteria population weighted averages were calculated in a similar way as previously described for data from questionnaires individual country and master databases were created from the template databases and data were entered in microsoft excel 2010 we performed the statistical analysis in stata 12 0 stata corp texas usa global maps with country specific thm concentrations were produced using arcgis version 10 3 1 esri 3 results regulatory status out of the 120 targeted counties we obtained information on drinking water quality regulations for 116 97 supplementary fig 2 and supplementary table 1 thms were regulated in 89 77 countries and the rest did not include thms in the drinking water regulations fig 1 tables 1 4 the mcl of total thms ranged from 25 μg l in denmark and the netherlands to 1000 μg l in botswana other countries with low mcls were austria zambia and italy 30 μg l followed by hungary luxembourg and germany 50 μg l by contrast countries with high mcls besides botswana were ecuador 500 μg l australia 250 μg l mexico 200 μg l and colombia 200 μg l reported mcl were between 50 and 150 μg l in 48 countries and among these the mcl was 100 μg l in 40 countries in 15 countries total thms mcl was set as 1 for the sum of the ratios of the concentration of each individual trihalomethane chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform to its respective maximum prescribed quantity five of these countries used who standards for individual thms finally only individual thms were regulated in 16 countries of which 3 countries used who standards tables 1 4 routine monitoring of 89 countries with thm regulations 47 53 conducted routine monitoring in contrast five countries albania nigeria uganda vietnam and zambia did not routinely monitor thms while routine thm monitoring in brazil colombia peru and thailand was not systematic finally despite thm regulations the routine monitoring practice was unknown in 33 countries 37 tables 1 4 source of thm data data were obtained exclusively through personal communications for 28 countries which include north america canada us chile and peru from south america japan republic of korea new zealand all northern european countries

countries with more than 10 coverage 55 countries are shown in fig 3 corresponding to the reporting years indicated in tables 1 4 4 discussion findings from this global assessment highlight the unbalanced regulatory status routine monitoring practice and data availability on thm occurrence among countries and regions there is an enormous gap between high income countries e g europe australia canada japan new zealand us vs low income countries e g sub saharan africa southeast asia unctad 2022 regulation routine monitoring measurement data and higher population coverage was concentrated in high income countries where surveillance data were centralised in some in contrast most low income countries lack any data or the population coverage was very limited partly due to lack of regulation routine monitoring and reporting to a central database limited data coverage is remarkable for large countries such as china which has a vast influence on environmental impacts at the planetary scale where urgent action is needed to reduce pollution and related harm persson et al 2022 dbps form complex mixtures richardson et al 2007 which constitute a methodological research challenge villanueva et al 2014 since the first identification of chloroform in drinking water in the 1970 s bellar et al 1974 rook 1974 total thms have been typically used as a dbp surrogate particularly when the disinfectant is chlorine other widespread by products of chlorination are haloacetic acids which are regulated in a few countries poleneni 2020 we focused our assessment on total thms since they have shown consistent associations with human health effects bladder cancer and an exposure response relationship exists costet et al 2011a villanueva et al 2004 however the use of total thms as a dbp surrogate has some limitations alternative disinfectants such as chloramines chlorine dioxide or ozone are increasingly being used to lower thm formation in turn alternative disinfectants increase the formation of other dbps mostly unregulated such as chlorite chlorate bromate nitrosamines organic nitrogenous dbps iodinated dbps and haloaldehydes which can also be of health concern richardson et al 2007 for example ozone and or chlorine dioxide are used instead of chlorine or to a much greater extent in many european countries to comply with thm regulations lenntech 2022 and many drinking water treatment plants in the us have switched to using chloramination to lower regulated thms and haloacetic acids bloodgood et al 2022 dbp classes differ in physico chemical characteristics and toxic properties and thms is the most characterised dbp class in terms of toxicity and human epidemiology richardson et al 2007 thm species chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform have different toxic properties with brominated species more lipophilic and genotoxic richardson et al 2007 as a consequence the use of total thms may hide disparities in composition and toxicity richardson et al 2007 finally thms may not necessarily be the drivers for the adverse health outcomes reported allen et al 2022 li and mitch 2018 richardson and plewa 2020 in summary although the use of total thms has limitations as a dbp surrogate given the complexity of dbps they constitute a valid dbp indicator for monitoring in case of chlorine based disinfection which is the most common worldwide the difficulties in thm data generation and sharing in low income settings can be explained by multiple reasons including technical financial and human resources constraints a substantial part of the population does not have access to piped water or other improved sources and chlorination frequently occurs if any at the end user level in which case the collection point for thm monitoring is not obvious or not easily accessible water sample collection processing and thm analysis is expensive and resource demanding sample collection has to follow a specific protocol e g avoid bubble formation and air cavities in the vial to avoid head space use of quenching agent refrigeration until the analysis within a week etc laboratory analysis requires appropriate sample preparation and the use of gas chromatography with electron capture or mass spectrometry detection run by trained personnel lack of laboratories equipment and human resources and transport issues e g inaccessibility of roads to send the samples to the laboratory is common in many lmics explain the difficulties to conduct routine thm monitoring the reasons underlying the difficulties in reporting and data sharing are complex and multiple the political dimension of water access e g private vs public that can be understood as a common good or as merchandise can be present and generate tensions in the provision of safe water at least part of the data are generated by private drinking water supply operators where data access is not usually or easily made public the lack of a centralised information system at the national level hampers the accessibility to data since primary information is scattered among numerous water utilities and agencies finally the regulatory context can also influence routine monitoring practice and reporting as non binding guidelines are less likely to end up in routine monitoring and reporting compared to binding legislation our study was subject to certain limitations a main challenge has been the identification and compilation of data from multiple sources and languages reported data from most lmics were from published research studies while data from high income countries were mostly from routine monitoring records centralised data was only available in a few countries the personal communications that provided routine monitoring data was dependent on the extent of the network of relationships although the steering committee of the study included professionals from different countries with a long track record in dbp research and a worldwide network of international contacts it is plausible to have missed key referents leading to underrepresentation of certain countries the study period was extended back to the late 1990 s in order to incorporate data from literature review from low and middle income countries but not only these see austria assuming that water sources and treatment practices have not likely experienced major changes which critically affect thm formation in these settings we considered that reporting old data was more informative than omitting such data completely presented data is indicative although not necessarily representive of current levels we combined measurements at the tap with measurements at the treatment plant and monitoring with research data which constitutes a source of uncertainty the use of country average concentrations disregards disparities within country e g among regions or cities within a country thus leading to potentially biased country estimates e g under or overestimation however a global assessment requires the use of simple metrics such as the average to easily allow comparison among a large number of countries in this worldwide effort inaccuracies in terms of regulatory status routine monitoring or specific thm figures coverage average etc may have occurred information for some countries may have been available online but missed during the literature review due to the use of the specific keywords search engines and languages in addition we used the available thm data provided or identified in the literature or public reports and we did not evaluate reliability or made any expert judgment concerning the reliability of measurements validation studies comparing existing data with ad hoc measurements are warranted in future studies to assess the reliability of routine monitoring data or published data the authors consider this as an initial effort open to corrections improvements updates and to be expanded to other widespread chemical contaminants in drinking water such as nitrate or arsenic among others in addition lessons learned can be applied to emerging chemical contaminants of concern such as per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas which constitute persistent and mobile contaminants widespread in the water cycle and which are objectives of new regulatory actions ec 2020 who 2022b among countries with more than 50 thm data coverage we observed highest average levels in australia and lowest in central and northern europe the reasons for the low levels achieved in some countries include the use of mostly ground water sources austria germany advanced treatment and distribution without the application of chlorine the netherlands switzerland smeets et al 2009 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 or a combination of both denmark lithuania hunkeler et al 2012 of note the thm mcl in drinking water in australia is 250 µg l which is one of the highest reported mcls for total thms as another example of how regulatory standards modulate occurrence concentrations average thms were 34 µg l in the us with a sd of 33 µg l thus the average plus one sd was 67 µg l the regulatory limit is 80 µg l where it was expected that utilities would try to stay below 64 µg l which includes a 20 safety factor 5 conclusions chemical quality of drinking water is a growing global problem that needs to be addressed the existence

15163,background trihalomethanes thm a major class of disinfection by products are widespread and are associated with adverse health effects we conducted a global evaluation of current thm regulations and concentrations in drinking water methods we included 120 countries 7000 million inhabitants in 2016 representing 94 of the world population we searched for country regulations and thm routine monitoring data using a questionnaire addressed to referent contacts scientific and gray literature was reviewed where contacts were not identified or declined participation we obtained or estimated annual average thm concentrations weighted to the population served when possible results drinking water regulations were ascertained for 116 120 97 countries with 89 116 77 including thm regulations routine monitoring was implemented in 47 89 53 of countries with thm regulations thm data with a varying population coverage was obtained for 69 120 58 countries consisting of 5600 million inhabitants

report data particularly in lmics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water chemicals disinfection by products trihalomethanes quality routine monitoring regulation international data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction humanity is facing a global water crisis of growing water scarcity along with quality issues this is largely caused by a steep increase in the world s population and in fresh water demand since the 1950 s including unsustainable extraction of ground water and poor infrastructure in water supply systems especially in low and middle income countries lmics bouabid and louis 2015 whitmee et al 2015 climate change crisis is expected to exacerbate water stress through decline of renewable surface water and ground water resources projected in most dry subtropical regions ipcc 2014 this leads to unprecedented and urgent pressures to ensure sustainable drinking water access for the present and future generations in many parts of the world chemical pollution of drinking water is a global growing problem that has received limited attention damania et al 2019 compared to water access sanitation and hygiene wash issues which are routinely monitored by the who unicef since 1990 the united nations un sustainable development goal sdg 6 urges to guarantee universal access to safe drinking water free from pollution by 2030 sdg target 6 3 mainly through improved drinking water sources and disinfection however there is a general lack of knowledge about the occurrence of chemicals in drinking water particularly in lmics chemical hazards in drinking water are multiple and from many origins e g nitrate from intensive agriculture and farming arsenic or fluoride from natural sources industrial chemicals from untreated effluents as well as chemical by products formed during disinfection processes to inactivate pathogens disinfection of drinking water is unquestionably necessary to provide microbiologically safe drinking water however disinfection by products dbps are unintentionally generated richardson et al 2007 virtually the entire population in developed countries is exposed to dbps through ingestion inhalation or dermal absorption when drinking or using municipal tap water for showering washing dishes or swimming in pools villanueva et al 2015 based on animal data the international agency for research on cancer iarc classifies chloroform and other dbps as possible human carcinogens iarc 2012 likewise bladder cancer has been consistently associated with long term dbps exposure in epidemiologic studies costet et al 2011b villanueva et al 2004 trihalomethanes thms are generally the most abundant dbp class formed in water treated with chlorine the most widely used water disinfectant and are used as a dbp marker the extent of dbp formation is impacted by precursor levels i e the amount of organic and inorganic materials occurring in the raw water that are transformed by the disinfectants to dbps the nature of the treatment disinfection processes and the dbp regulations who guidelines for individual thms are 300 μg l for chloroform 100 μg l for bromoform 100 μg l for dibromochloromethane and 60 μg l for bromodichloromethane who 2022a the maximum contaminant level mcl established by the european union eu is 100 μg l for total thms i e the sum of chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform ec 2020 although a few member states may have more stringent regulations prior to 2001 in the united states us the mcl for total thms was 100 μg l and after 2006 it is currently 80 μg l demarini 2020 in the period 2010 2014 following the implementation of the current thm regulatory levels there has been a reduction of 20 μg l in the average total thm occurrence for the highest 5 of systems serving 100 000 people across 44 us states compared to 1997 1998 seidel et al 2017 worldwide centralized information on regulation monitoring and thm measurements in drinking water is missing or is scarce and scattered and beyond europe evlampidou et al 2020 and the us weisman et al 2022 there are no systematic studies reporting these data in this context and expanding a preceding eu based thm assessment evlampidou et al 2020 we conducted a global evaluation of chemical quality of drinking water focusing on thms and including the most populated countries worldwide we report the current state of knowledge on the regulatory status and routine monitoring practice of thms as well as thm occurrence data worldwide 2 methods 2 1 study design and population during 2017 2020 we performed a worldwide ecological descriptive study using existing and available data on regulations and data on thm concentrations from 1997 to 2020 we included countries presented in the eu based thm assessment evlampidou et al 2020 and expanded on the missing european countries we additionally selected the most populated countries within each of the un regions 2015 revision in descending order until 75 coverage for the specific un region was achieved un 2015 this initial list was expanded to include countries mentioned in the who report on drinking water standards and thm regulations worldwide who 2021 and countries where we had personal contacts or encountered relevant information during the literature review countries with active war at the time of data collection were not included we finally targeted 120 countries tables 1 4 accounting for 6 993 800 182 inhabitants and representing approximately 94 of the world population in 2016 ihme 2016 2 2 data collection questionnaire used in personal communications we designed a questionnaire to collect data on thm regulations and monitoring practice water source and disinfection methods supplementary material fig 1 the questionnaire also ascertained the institution person providing the information reporting year and geographic region population served and maximum permissible level for thms according to the country s regulation maximum concentration level mcl or guidelines we created a template database to compile data for any year between 2010 and 2016 on an annual average standard deviation sd and number of water samples tested for total thms chloroform bromodichloromethane chlorodibromomethane and bromoform between october 2017 and february 2018 we sent the study questionnaire to experts in national agencies ministries of health institutes of public health water agencies etc universities and research centres with responsibilities in the maintenance or generation of data on drinking water quality where possible the raw thm data was requested and the template database provided literature review and gray literature for countries where experts were not identified or declined to participate we explored other data sources such as online open data and public reports and by personal communications we performed a literature review according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma and expanded the study period to 1997 2020 we aimed to identify drinking water regulations and open online monitoring reports with thm measurements at the tap distribution systems or water treatment plants from official websites e g ministry of health municipality etc water companies and or private laboratories secondly we performed a literature search for published peer reviewed scientific articles and gray literature including masters or phd theses using the online databases pubmed google scholar mendeley and google we used no restriction to any language and used these keywords in english language country name and drinking water or potable water or water quality and trihalomethanes or thms or disinfection by products or chlorination by products or chloroform when performing this search in google we also used the french spanish and portuguese translation of the keywords when encountering websites in the local language we used the google automatic translation service to translate the relevant text or page into english when necessary the literature review on china was conducted by a native chinese speaker we included articles and reports when thm data were based on actual measurements but we excluded them when only modelled thm data were provided for the data extraction and entry we used an adapted extended version of the template thm database and created separate country based datasets we looked for drinking water regulations in a broad sense i e including either guidelines non binding recommendations or binding maximum contaminant levels in addition to the above we used the keywords guidelines or legislation or law or regulations or order for information extraction and entry we created a thm country regulation database due to the ecological design of the study and the anonymity of data ethics approval was not sought 2 3 data analysis to estimate country thm indices and population coverage based on data from questionnaires for the estimation of thm descriptive statistics and population coverage we used data as provided or performed additional analysis including application of population weights whenever possible the procedure was as follows when only country wide average thm concentrations and population size were available through our data sources we used the country average thm and population served coverage data as was when raw data were available and measurements were below the detection limit dl we assigned half the value of the reporting laboratory s dl when only data for the four thms was available we calculated total thms by summing the individual components we used the mean values of thms instead of median values despite the skewedness of some data because many countries provided mean values and published literature commonly reports means for the minimum and maximum values we used the non weighted thm levels to show the actual range we calculated the country population weighted average thm level and standard deviation sd when area specific e g localities municipalities regions etc thm data were available which we then assigned to the whole country for the calculation of the individual weights the country population weighted thm average and the population served coverage we used the country and reporting areas population figures provided either by the national experts or from census data for the reporting year or if more than one year data was available closest to the mid point reporting period additionally for the estimation of the population served coverage we primarily used country level population size in 2016 from the global burden of disease 2016 study ihme 2016 and secondarily either information from specific country request or from the national statistical offices or from wikipedia using the search term demographics of country name 13 countries based on data from literature review we obtained or calculated average thm estimates for specific reporting areas from data available in the literature online open data public reports scientific research articles firstly all identified articles and reports were entered into an excel sheet with the following information country name authors publication date article title journal reporting year study area population covered type of water e g surface water ground water mixed and disinfection method secondly the full text of the article was assessed and information was extracted and entered in another excel sheet including reported mean standard deviation sd range minimum maximum and median for total thms chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and or bromoform in each study area in a third step thm indices were entered in a table to summarize the final thm indices per country province or city if more than one study was conducted in the area and in the same water network the more recent published thm mean values were included and the average thm value was calculated for the area from all studies published in the same year articles that did not report thm mean values were excluded in the third step the extraction steps were checked by two authors to assess whether the information in the papers was accurately extracted and the articles met the inclusion criteria population weighted averages were calculated in a similar way as previously described for data from questionnaires individual country and master databases were created from the template databases and data were entered in microsoft excel 2010 we performed the statistical analysis in stata 12 0 stata corp texas usa global maps with country specific thm concentrations were produced using arcgis version 10 3 1 esri 3 results regulatory status out of the 120 targeted counties we obtained information on drinking water quality regulations for 116 97 supplementary fig 2 and supplementary table 1 thms were regulated in 89 77 countries and the rest did not include thms in the drinking water regulations fig 1 tables 1 4 the mcl of total thms ranged from 25 μg l in denmark and the netherlands to 1000 μg l in botswana other countries with low mcls were austria zambia and italy 30 μg l followed by hungary luxembourg and germany 50 μg l by contrast countries with high mcls besides botswana were ecuador 500 μg l australia 250 μg l mexico 200 μg l and colombia 200 μg l reported mcl were between 50 and 150 μg l in 48 countries and among these the mcl was 100 μg l in 40 countries in 15 countries total thms mcl was set as 1 for the sum of the ratios of the concentration of each individual trihalomethane chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform to its respective maximum prescribed quantity five of these countries used who standards for individual thms finally only individual thms were regulated in 16 countries of which 3 countries used who standards tables 1 4 routine monitoring of 89 countries with thm regulations 47 53 conducted routine monitoring in contrast five countries albania nigeria uganda vietnam and zambia did not routinely monitor thms while routine thm monitoring in brazil colombia peru and thailand was not systematic finally despite thm regulations the routine monitoring practice was unknown in 33 countries 37 tables 1 4 source of thm data data were obtained exclusively through personal communications for 28 countries which include north america canada us chile and peru from south america japan republic of korea new zealand all northern european countries

hungary poland and slovakia we used personal contacts complemented with literature review for albania brazil china colombia lebanon nigeria romania russian federation and thailand we used personal contacts and open data for greece and italy for south africa we used personal contacts literature review and public reports to obtain data for turkey we used scientific literature and public reports data for australia cambodia france luxemburg and spain was obtained exclusively through public reports data for singapore and ireland was based entirely on open data publicly available for the remaining countries data on average thm levels was acquired exclusively from the scientific literature tables 1 4 the name of contacts providing personal communications are in supplementary table 2 bibliographic references used when literature review or open data was used are shown in the supplementary table 3 population coverage of thm data among 120 countries thm data with a varying population

countries with more than 10 coverage 55 countries are shown in fig 3 corresponding to the reporting years indicated in tables 1 4 4 discussion findings from this global assessment highlight the unbalanced regulatory status routine monitoring practice and data availability on thm occurrence among countries and regions there is an enormous gap between high income countries e g europe australia canada japan new zealand us vs low income countries e g sub saharan africa southeast asia unctad 2022 regulation routine monitoring measurement data and higher population coverage was concentrated in high income countries where surveillance data were centralised in some in contrast most low income countries lack any data or the population coverage was very limited partly due to lack of regulation routine monitoring and reporting to a central database limited data coverage is remarkable for large countries such as china which has a vast influence on environmental impacts at the planetary scale where urgent action is needed to reduce pollution and related harm persson et al 2022 dbps form complex mixtures richardson et al 2007 which constitute a methodological research challenge villanueva et al 2014 since the first identification of chloroform in drinking water in the 1970 s bellar et al 1974 rook 1974 total thms have been typically used as a dbp surrogate particularly when the disinfectant is chlorine other widespread by products of chlorination are haloacetic acids which are regulated in a few countries poleneni 2020 we focused our assessment on total thms since they have shown consistent associations with human health effects bladder cancer and an exposure response relationship exists costet et al 2011a villanueva et al 2004 however the use of total thms as a dbp surrogate has some limitations alternative disinfectants such as chloramines chlorine dioxide or ozone are increasingly being used to lower thm formation in turn alternative disinfectants increase the formation of other dbps mostly unregulated such as chlorite chlorate bromate nitrosamines organic nitrogenous dbps iodinated dbps and haloaldehydes which can also be of health concern richardson et al 2007 for example ozone and or chlorine dioxide are used instead of chlorine or to a much greater extent in many european countries to comply with thm regulations lenntech 2022 and many drinking water treatment plants in the us have switched to using chloramination to lower regulated thms and haloacetic acids bloodgood et al 2022 dbp classes differ in physico chemical characteristics and toxic properties and thms is the most characterised dbp class in terms of toxicity and human epidemiology richardson et al 2007 thm species chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform have different toxic properties with brominated species more lipophilic and genotoxic richardson et al 2007 as a consequence the use of total thms may hide disparities in composition and toxicity richardson et al 2007 finally thms may not necessarily be the drivers for the adverse health outcomes reported allen et al 2022 li and mitch 2018 richardson and plewa 2020 in summary although the use of total thms has limitations as a dbp surrogate given the complexity of dbps they constitute a valid dbp indicator for monitoring in case of chlorine based disinfection which is the most common worldwide the difficulties in thm data generation and sharing in low income settings can be explained by multiple reasons including technical financial and human resources constraints a substantial part of the population does not have access to piped water or other improved sources and chlorination frequently occurs if any at the end user level in which case the collection point for thm monitoring is not obvious or not easily accessible water sample collection processing and thm analysis is expensive and resource demanding sample collection has to follow a specific protocol e g avoid bubble formation and air cavities in the vial to avoid head space use of quenching agent refrigeration until the analysis within a week etc laboratory analysis requires appropriate sample preparation and the use of gas chromatography with electron capture or mass spectrometry detection run by trained personnel lack of laboratories equipment and human resources and transport issues e g inaccessibility of roads to send the samples to the laboratory is common in many lmics explain the difficulties to conduct routine thm monitoring the reasons underlying the difficulties in reporting and data sharing are complex and multiple the political dimension of water access e g private vs public that can be understood as a common good or as merchandise can be present and generate tensions in the provision of safe water at least part of the data are generated by private drinking water supply operators where data access is not usually or easily made public the lack of a centralised information system at the national level hampers the accessibility to data since primary information is scattered among numerous water utilities and agencies finally the regulatory context can also influence routine monitoring practice and reporting as non binding guidelines are less likely to end up in routine monitoring and reporting compared to binding legislation our study was subject to certain limitations a main challenge has been the identification and compilation of data from multiple sources and languages reported data from most lmics were from published research studies while data from high income countries were mostly from routine monitoring records centralised data was only available in a few countries the personal communications that provided routine monitoring data was dependent on the extent of the network of relationships although the steering committee of the study included professionals from different countries with a long track record in dbp research and a worldwide network of international contacts it is plausible to have missed key referents leading to underrepresentation of certain countries the study period was extended back to the late 1990 s in order to incorporate data from literature review from low and middle income countries but not only these see austria assuming that water sources and treatment practices have not likely experienced major changes which critically affect thm formation in these settings we considered that reporting old data was more informative than omitting such data completely presented data is indicative although not necessarily representive of current levels we combined measurements at the tap with measurements at the treatment plant and monitoring with research data which constitutes a source of uncertainty the use of country average concentrations disregards disparities within country e g among regions or cities within a country thus leading to potentially biased country estimates e g under or overestimation however a global assessment requires the use of simple metrics such as the average to easily allow comparison among a large number of countries in this worldwide effort inaccuracies in terms of regulatory status routine monitoring or specific thm figures coverage average etc may have occurred information for some countries may have been available online but missed during the literature review due to the use of the specific keywords search engines and languages in addition we used the available thm data provided or identified in the literature or public reports and we did not evaluate reliability or made any expert judgment concerning the reliability of measurements validation studies comparing existing data with ad hoc measurements are warranted in future studies to assess the reliability of routine monitoring data or published data the authors consider this as an initial effort open to corrections improvements updates and to be expanded to other widespread chemical contaminants in drinking water such as nitrate or arsenic among others in addition lessons learned can be applied to emerging chemical contaminants of concern such as per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas which constitute persistent and mobile contaminants widespread in the water cycle and which are objectives of new regulatory actions ec 2020 who 2022b among countries with more than 50 thm data coverage we observed highest average levels in australia and lowest in central and northern europe the reasons for the low levels achieved in some countries include the use of mostly ground water sources austria germany advanced treatment and distribution without the application of chlorine the netherlands switzerland smeets et al 2009 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 or a combination of both denmark lithuania hunkeler et al 2012 of note the thm mcl in drinking water in australia is 250 µg l which is one of the highest reported mcls for total thms as another example of how regulatory standards modulate occurrence concentrations average thms were 34 µg l in the us with a sd of 33 µg l thus the average plus one sd was 67 µg l the regulatory limit is 80 µg l where it was expected that utilities would try to stay below 64 µg l which includes a 20 safety factor 5 conclusions chemical quality of drinking water is a growing global problem that needs to be addressed the existence of national guidelines and country legislation can help ensure the safety of drinking water particularly when binding legislation exists the need for disinfection of drinking water to provide microbiologically safe water is unquestionable to prevent diarrhoeal diseases and death but measures to minimize dbp formation exist wherever possible or applicable individual countries where thm regulations do not exist need to create new binding regulations set mcls and allocate budget capacity building may be necessary to ensure regular thm monitoring through specific training and equipment

15164,in this study manganese oxide mno dispersed on cn mn ncn was fabricated as a catalyst in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation hco achieving excellent catalytic performance on refractory organic pollutant degradation via the synergistic effects between mno and cn the study demonstrated that the c n mn and c o mn bonds constructed in the catalyst linking mno and cn created the synergistic effects which could overcome typical problems such as metal leaching etc the c n mn and c o mn bonds could promote electron transfer from cation π reactions to form electron rich mn ii sites and electron poor cn sites the electron rich mn ii sites as active sites supplied electrons to ozone which then further evolved into reactive oxygen species ros the electron poor cn sites captured electrons from the pollutant intermediate radicals to electron rich mn ii sites via cation π reactions with the help of c n mn and c o mn bonds which promote the redox reactions of mn the surface hydroxyl groups also participated in ozone decomposition and ros production additionally oh was the dominant ros of the mn ncn hco processes this study presents the excellent hco performance of mn ncn as well as provides views on the electron transfer route between the catalyst pollutant and ozone which is crucial for the design of the catalyst graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords catalytic ozonation mno cn synergistic effect atrazine data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction heterogeneous catalytic ozonation hco has been extensively applied in water treatment field due to its robustly refractory organic pollutant degradation ability the property of the catalyst is crucial in determining the efficiency of hco chen and

and hu 2018 etc and metal metal oxides loaded on supports e g co n cnts wang et al 2021b and fe pumice yuan et al 2016 etc were frequently employed catalysts among them manganese oxides are frequently studied as outstanding catalysts due to their highly catalytic activities eco friendliness as well as wide dispersion in nature the combination of manganese oxides with non metallic materials could significantly improve the efficiency of hco by suppressing the metal leaching problem overcoming the high energy barrier from the reduction of m n m to mn m metal species and preventing the agglomeration of ultrafine metal oxide nanoparticles in solution for instance tian et al 2021 reported that a mn loaded biochar mnox biochar catalyst demonstrated excellent hco activity xu et al 2019 synthesized a heterogeneous solid catalyst mno2 nh2 go through amino functionalized hybrid of mno2 and go with the hydrothermal method to efficiently degrade cephalexin therefore combining manganese oxides with non metallic materials is a good way to achieve excellent hco performance to date mn iv is the predominantly studied oxidation state which plays a crucial role in redox or radical reactions while few studies focus on the role of mn ii in hco processes wang et al 2019c developed novel mn ii bonded oxidized carbon nanotubes mn ii ocnts which acted as an efficient hco catalyst interestingly this catalyst achieved hco activity by reversible desorption and adsorption of mn ii on oxidized carbon nanotube ocnt surfaces which actually works as homogeneous processes to the best of our knowledge the catalytic activity induced by heterogeneous mn ii based catalysts in hco processes has not been reported compared with commonly studied mn iv oxide mn ii oxide is more easily dispersed on the surface of nonmetallic materials and has stronger anti agglomeration ability yang et al 2014 in addition in the oxidation system the redox cycle of mn ii mn iii is more accessible than that of mn iv mn iii liu et al 2018b considering the beneficial effect of the interaction between heterogeneous mn ii based catalysts and carbonaceous materials it was deemed desirable to combine manganese oxide mno with carbonaceous materials with reliable heterogeneous catalytic ozonation hco capacity in this work mno dispersed on carbon nitride material denoted as mn cn has been successfully fabricated the resultant catalyst displayed high activity and durability in degradation of the persistent herbicide atrazine atz through an hco process dong et al 2022a series catalysts with various loading amounts of mno denoted as mn ncn were synthesized to investigate the synergistic hco effect between mno and cn the c o mn and c n mn bonds generated between mn ii oxide and cn were considered as the main active sites explored by several characterizations in addition the catalytic activity reactive oxygen species ros generation and hco mechanism of mn ncn were well investigated the possible degradation intermediates and their acute toxicity were also determined 2 experimental sections 2 1 reagents and materials the reagents and materials used are listed in text

and 10 next the dried mn ndap powders were placed in a tube furnace and calcined under an argon atmosphere at 450 c for 3 h with a heating rate of 3 c min 1 the final obtained samples were denoted as mn ncn for comparison the 2 6 dap treated by the same procedure with the exception of adding mno2 was denoted as cn both commercial mno denoted as c mno and prepared mno p mno have been tested as reference catalysts the method used to obtain p mno was similar to that reported previously fu et al 2021 for the reductive synthesis of mn ncn 2 3 characterization the characterization of the prepared catalysts involved are listed in text s2 2 4 catalytic ozonation procedure a laboratory ozone generator 3s a5 tonglin beijing china was used to generate ozone from high pure oxygen 99 9 stock solutions of ozone were obtained through a stainless steel porous aeration diffuser bubbling ozone into the bottom of the cylindrical reactor height 35 cm diameter 9 cm actual volume 2 l containing upw at 4 c for 30 min the stock solutions of ozone concentrations were determined directly by a uv vis spectrometer t6 persee beijing china at 260 nm ε 3200 m 1 cm 1 the hco procedures were conducted in batch mode in a 150 ml in house laboratory made reactor with a water bath all experiments were performed at 10 c excluding the effect of the temperature experiment and solution ph was adjusted with hclo4 and naoh wang et al 2018 reactions were initiated by adding pre determined volumes of the ozone stock solution 3 mg l 1 of initial ozone dosage after bubbling into definite amounts of the solutions 5 μm atz and 30 mg l 1 catalysts at given time intervals samples were extracted and filtered with ptfe syringe filters pore size 0 22 μm before analyzing the residual atz and ozone concentrations moreover dissolved ozone in the samples was quenched with 20 μl of 12 5 g l 1 na2s2o3 solution to simulate atz degradation in a more realistic water matrix secondary effluent from a real wastewater treatment plant wwtp was collected from hengfeng wwtp in deqing china the collected water sample denoted as hfww was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and then spiked with atz to 5 μm prior to use the main characteristics of the water sample are presented in table s1 2 5 analytical method the analytical method employed are shown in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 textural properties of catalysts x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the prepared mn ncn n 0 5 4 8 and cn are displayed in fig 1 a it is worth noting that the prepared mn ncn agrees well with the mno jcpds no 07 0230 rather than mno2 without any other peaks implying that high purity mno was effectively formed wang et al 2015 since the precursor of mno used in this study was pure mno2 fig s1 the possible transformation process of mno2 to mno should be well investigated after drying processes at 80 c the crystal phase of the obtained mn 4dap fig s2 was found to match well with a mixture of 2 6 dap jcpds no 41 1765 mno2 jcpds no 81 1947 and mn3o4 jcpds no 24 0734 indicating that partial mn iv in mno2 had been transformed into mn ii and mn iii in the subsequent calcination process the mixture of mno2 and mn3o4 is further converted into mno fu et al 2018 liu et al 2015 we assumed that 2 6 dap might act as a strong reductant during the synthesis which reduces mn iv to mn ii to prove this supposition a mn 0 1cn sample was prepared by adding excessive mno2 and insufficient 2 6 dap the obtained sample fig s3 revealed a mixture phase of mn3o4 and mno2 therefore the possible transformation process of mno2 to mno follows eqs 2 and 3 during the calcination process fu et al 2018 2 3 mn o 2 c 2 6 dap m n 3 o 4 c o 2 3 2 m n 3 o 4 c 2 6 dap 6 mno c o 2 thermal gravimetric analysis tga and differential thermal analysis dta of mn 4dap in an argon flow are shown in fig s4 the weight loss at 70 c 240 c is assigned to the evaporation of residual h2o and partial organic precursors while the weight loss at 240 c 450 c represents the evaporation of the remainder of the organic precursors increasing the pyrolysis temperature to 1000 c only caused 10 more weight loss suggesting the 450 c pyrolysis temperature is suitable for the formation of the stable mn ncn structure as shown in fig 1 a the synthesized cn sample revealed a broad peak at ca 26 which is assigned to the typical graphitic interlayer 002 peak gao et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 however such a peak was not abundant in the mn ncn samples since the xrd patterns were acquired from exposed surface crystallite planes of the samples the invisible graphitic peak might be due to the cover layer of mno or the different formation of cn in the mn ncn samples to clarify the detailed reason the morphology and nanostructures of the catalysts were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem the as formed mn 4cn fig 1 b presented as regular elliptic nanoparticles with longitudinal length of 250 nm 300 nm and a transverse diameter of 70 nm 90 nm which is similar to the other mn ncn samples but different from the mno2 as circular nanoparticles fig s5 a the cn sample displayed a dense honeycomb structural morphology fig s5 d the hrtem image of the mn 4cn fig 1 c revealed a high degree of crystallized mno nanoparticles which were closely connected to amorphous cn this may be the reason why a strong graphitic peak appeared in the cn sample but disappeared in the mn ncn samples the mno nanoparticles with a diameter of 8 nm presented clear lattice fringes with distances of 0 222 nm fig 1 c yellow arrows which were well indexed to the 200 plane energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds of cn and mno in mn 4cn were presented in fig 1 d c yellow n red o blue and mn green were all uniformly dispersed within the composite therefore the as prepared mn ncn was universally performed by mno nanoparticles supported on cn elliptic nanoparticles fig s6 shows the pore structures and pore size distributions of prepared mn ncn n 0 5 4 8 and cn samples typical type iv patterns with a h3 hysteresis loop of mn ncn proved its mesopores structure the specific surface area s bet pore volumes and diameters of prepared catalysts were recorded in table 1 it is obvious that the s bet of mno2 is 90 4 m2 g 1 higher than those of mn 0 5cn 18 8 m2 g 1 mn 4cn 11 0 m2 g 1 mn 8cn 7 9 m2 g 1 and cn 2 2 m2 g 1 consequently the doping of mn oxides increased the surface area of the cn composites large s bet and mesopores structure induced more exposed active sites which is beneficial to reduce mass diffusion limit shortening the path for removing organic pollution to allow better catalytic performance although the limited s bet of cn was undesirable for catalyst processes the specific interaction between mno and cn might promote catalytic ability such as by enhancing the dispersion of mno and reducing the diameter of mno the detailed enhanced catalytic mechanism of mn ncn will be discussed below in addition all the mn ncn revealed low pore volumes table 1 suggesting the hco processes mainly occurred on the surface of mn 4cn rather than in the pore or channel 3 2 hco performance of catalysts fig 2 a shows the degradation of atz by sole ozonation o3 alone hco with as prepared mno2 o3 mno2 cn o3 cn mn 4cn o3 mn 4cn p mno o3 p mno and c mno o3 c mno the adsorption ability of mn 4cn for atz adsorption was first measured to serve as a benchmark for the following hco processes mn 4cn exhibited slight adsorption to atz 5 after 20 min which might be due to its relatively low s bet only 40 7 of the atz was degraded by o3 alone indicating that atz is refractory in this reaction system hco by mn 4cn achieved the highest atz degradation efficiency of 98 0 which is higher than that by mno2 54 3 depicting the advantages of cn modification to investigate the roles of mno and cn in mn ncn during the hco process the atz degradation efficiencies of p mno c mno and the prepared cn were separately tested none of these three catalysts effectively improved the atz degradation efficiency alone 42 8 43 1 and 48 4 respectively revealing the operation of a synergistic effect between mno and cn in mn 4cn for hco of atz the pollutant degradation efficiency of mn 4cn was superior or comparable to those of some typical hco catalysts reported previously table s2 in addition measurements of total organic carbon toc removal with ozone o3 and o3 mn 4cn showed little variation after 20 min fig s7 due to the inadequate o3 dosage for mineralization atz o3 5 62 5 molar ratio to investigate the effect of mno cn ratio on mn ncn synthesis and the associated hco activity various mn ncn catalysts with different proportions of cn and mno n 0 1 0 5 1 4 5 8 and 10 were synthesized by using different molar ratios of 2 6 dap to mno2 as shown in fig 2 b the atz degradation efficiency gradually enhanced when n increased from 0 1 to 0 5 and then reached a plateau of high efficiency degradation of 98 0 n 1 and 4 when n increased to 5 and 8 the degradation efficiency was decreased to 86 2 and 71 7 respectively while n 10 the degradation rate decreased to 53 1 which was very close to the hco by the prepared cn o3 decomposition efficiencies over various mn ncn catalysts accompany with the atz degradation efficiencies fig 2 b are displayed in fig s8 with the increase of cn content the o3 decomposition rate gradually decreased indicating that the main active sites for ozonation activation are mn sites rather than cn structures the results further indicated that the catalytic capacities of the mn ncn were not simply dependent on the contents of mno and cn combined with xrd analysis fig s3 the poor performance of mn 0 1cn may have been due to the formation of mn3o4 and mno2 rather than mno excessive cn as in mn 8cn also did not result in satisfactory hco performance which may have been due to the drastically decreased s bet table 1 or the lack of active sites provided by mno therefore only certain ratios of mno cn n 0 5 1 and 4 result in high hco performance and the mechanism underpinning these findings is explored in section 3 3 we performed catalyst cycle tests as well as mn leaching tests to evaluate the stability of the catalysts and determine the mn ion dissolution the degradation of atz by hco using reused mn 4cn is depicted in fig 2 c the second third and fourth use of the mn 4cn show the atz degradation decreased from 98 0 to 96 5 93 7 and 91 6 in a 20 min reaction respectively witnessing a gradual slight decline in mn 4cn performance for hco moreover the mn ion released from mn 4cn after hco was determined according to fig 2 d it was found that only 11 μg l 1 of mn ii were measured after 20 min reaction at ph 7 following that mn ion leaching from mn 4cn increased slightly in the second cycle with mn ion concentrations reaching 16 μg l 1 after the third and fourth cycles only 7 μg l 1 and 4 μg l 1 of the mn ion were detected in the solution because the dosage of mn 4cn during the reaction was 30 mg l 1 and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes analysis revealed that the content of the mn species in mn 4cn was 32 22 wt table s3 the maximum amount of dissolution only contributed 0 17 of the mn dose as a result the leaching of manganese ions on the experiment could be ignored the synergistic effect between mno and cn it is assumed effectively prevented mn species from leaching during the hco considering the degradation efficiency the cost of materials and the unavoidable problem of metal dissolution mn 4cn was chosen as the optimum catalyst and the mn ncn n 0 5 and 8 catalysts were used as supplements for the following investigation to explore the mechanism of the enhanced hco effect 3 3 synergistic role of mno and cn full scan x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectra of mn ncn and cn are shown in fig s9 in which the observed peaks c 1s n 1s o 1s and mn 2p and 3s exclude cn indicate the presence of mn exclude cn o n and c elements table s3 lists the mn contents in each mn ncn sample calculated theoretically and measured by xps and icp oes briefly the mn contents in each mn ncn sample followed the order icp oes xps theoretical calculation the lowest mn contents obtained by theoretical calculation may be due to the loss of carbonaceous components during pyrolysis of the actual samples besides the higher mn contents detected by icp oes compared to xps may be due to the different detection depths and areas nassr et al 2013 xps provides information on the surfaces of samples while icp oes yields bulk information according to fesem and hrtem inspection the mno in mn 4cn is present as nanoparticles whereas cn adopts an amorphous structure therefore it can be concluded that more cn was exposed on the surface of mn ncn than mn tables s4 and s5 list the valence states and existing forms of elemental mn c n and o with the help of deconvolution analysis the mn 2p spectrum of mn ncn fig 3 a contained three peaks at 640 9 ev 644 5 ev and 653 ev which could be assigned to mn ii 2p3 2 satellite structure and mn ii 2p1 2 respectively chu et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 the binding energy difference es between the doublet peaks of mn 2p was 12 1 ev indicating that the mn species in these catalysts were in the mn ii oxidation state attributed to the formation of mno of mn ncn n 0 5 4 8 furthermore the es between the doublet peaks of mn 3s can be used to estimate the real average oxidation state aos of the surface mn in the mn ncn mn 4dap c mno and mno2 using the following equation eq 4 and the detailed values were shown in table s4 galakhov et al 2002 zhu et al 2021 4 aos 8 956 1 126 es as shown in fig 3 b the aos of mn ncn n 0 5 4 8 and c mno were both 2 further confirming the existence of mno and absence of amorphous mno2 for the prepared mn ncn in contrast the aos for mno2 was 4 fig s10 suggesting the high purity of mno2 the aos for mn 4dap was 3 20 fig s11 indicating that part of the mn was reduced by the drying processes which is consistent with the xrd characterization of mn 4dap fig s2 more importantly the mn 2p3 2 peak of mn ncn which had a binding energy of 641 5 ev compared to that of c mno changed towards a lower binding energy indicating that electrons had transferred from cn to mno as shown in fig 3 c the c 1s xps of cn could be divided into three peaks attributed to the formation of c c c c 284 6 ev c n 285 8 ev and c o c 286 7 ev respectively feng et al 2020 wang et al 2015 xiao et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 a new peak at 288 6 ev was ascribed to c o mn of mn ncn chen et al 2012 the n 1s xps spectrum was deconvoluted into three peaks with the binding energies of 398 2 ev 399 6 ev and 400 5 ev for pyridinic n mn n and pyrrolic n respectively fig 3 d jiang et al 2020 song et al 2019a wang et al 2021a zhu et al 2018 in contrast to mn ncn no mn n peak could be observed in the sole cn the detailed content of surface elements for various catalysts were shown in table s5 combined with the c 1s and n 1s analysis mno was bonded to c n heterocycles via c n mn and c o mn in mn n complexation rather than a simple mixture xie et al 2022 the structures offer the polarization differences of components on material surface generating electron rich center and electron poor center and increasing the possibility of charge transfer of π cation σ donation lyu et al 2018 mahadevi and sastry 2013 zhang et al 2019 the cn aromatic rings formed bonds with mno creating a mn ii π interaction via the c n mn and c o mn bonding bridge shifting the π electrons on the surface of mn ncn to the mn center effectively changing the surface electron distribution and encouraging the formation of electron rich mn centers according to fig 3 e the high resolution o 1s spectrum of mn ncn and c mno could be divided into three peaks respectively including lattice o olat 529 9 ev surface adsorbed oh groups ooh 531 2 ev and adsorbed molecular water oh2o 533 2 ev lin et al 2021 yu et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 moreover the cn only had one adsorbed molecular water peak which could be due to water adsorption during air exposure according to the literature metal oxide surface adsorbed oh groups may act as active sites to promote ozone decomposition and oh formation thereby promoting pollutant degradation ma et al 2005 therefore the xps results showed that the c n mn and c o mn structures electron rich mn ii centers and surface adsorbed oh groups co existed in mn cn catalysts to further pinpoint the active sites of the mn ncn catalysts and demonstrate the synergistic effect of mn and cn on hco a series of surface properties were characterized fig 4 a shows the raman spectra for mn 4cn and cn the peak at 647 cm 1 which is characteristic of mn o vibrational bands was also observed for mn 4cn confirming the presence of mno in the mn 4cn feng et al 2020 zhu et al 2018 the peak at 1384 cm 1 assigned to the typical d band which represents characteristic features of disordered carbon or defective graphitic structures while the peak at 1603 cm 1 is typical g band which represents characteristic features of graphitic layers yang et al 2014 the ratio of d band g band intensities i d i g can reflect the defect levels the i d i g band intensity ratio of mn 4cn was 1 394 which was somewhat higher than the sole cn 1 158 revealing that the interaction between mno2 and 2 6 dap through high temperature reaction increased the degree of defects according to xrd results fig 1 a the full widths at half maximum of the mno peaks in the mn 4cn sample were broader than those of c mno indicating lower crystallinity the low crystallinity meant that the mno component in the mn 4cn sample contained more defects which made it easier for mn sites to participate in the hco reaction and undergo valence transition in the redox process wang et al 2020a according to fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis shown in fig 4 b a new peak at about 665 cm 1 appeared in all samples but the cn was assigned to the bending vibration of mn o wang et al 2022 the bands at about 3400 cm 1 were assigned to the characteristic peaks of the surface hydroxyl groups or water in stretching mode qi and xie 2018 the addition of mn species in mn ncn promoted an increase in peak intensity at about 3400 cm 1 due to the increased hydroxyl groups adsorption on metal sites which was beneficial to the adsorption of ozone besides the peak at about 1600 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of c n and c c as well as surface hydroxyl groups bending vibration hu et al 2017 qi and xie 2018 the peak stretching at about 1400 cm 1 was a characteristic due to c n and c o jothinathan et al 2022 wang et al 2022 the polar group peaks such as c n c o could promote the polarization difference to form an electron rich mn center through c o mn and c n mn according to a previous study pyridine ftir was applied to analysis the amount and categories of surface acid sites fig 4 c illustrates the pyridine ftir over mn 4cn at 423 k and 623 k obviously two strong ir bands appeared at 1452 cm 1 and 1604 cm 1 were assigned to the presence of strong lewis acid the band at 1495 cm 1 represents to both lewis and bronsted acid sites the surface of mn 4cn exposed abundant total acid sites 47 7 μmol g 1 and medium strong acid sites 20 9 μmol g 1 according to yu et al 2020 the primary lewis acid sites in the majority of hco studies involving metal oxides catalysts were the metal components covered by hydroxyl groups particularly transition metals on the catalyst surface with surface hydroxyl groups acting as active sites as a strong lewis base phosphate could be applied to evaluate whether the lewis acid sites were the catalytic active centers for hco numerous studies have revealed that phosphate has a strong affinity for the surface lewis acid sites of catalysts can replace their surface hydroxyl groups and ultimately prevent ozone from being activated eqs 7 and 8 in addition phosphate also serves as a scavenger for oh and their reaction rate constants k oh h2po4 2 104 m 1 s 1 k oh hpo4 2 1 5 105 m 1 s 1 are much lower than those of atz and oh k oh atz 3 109 m 1 s 1 sui et al 2012 wang et al 2019a as shown in fig s12 the atz degradation efficiency was remarkably suppressed by adding 1 μm phosphate which decreased by 40 compared with that in hco without phosphate at 20 min when adding up the phosphate concentration to 1 mm into the o3 mn 4cn process about 45 3 atz was decomposed at 20 min which was almost the same as the degradation efficiency that the o3 alone process could reach 45 8 the results implied that catalytic capacity of mn 4cn is totally inhibited according to eqs 5 and 6 5 m n 2 o h m n 2 oh 6 mn oh po 4 3 mn po 4 2 o h it is generally accepted that the dissociated water molecules adsorb on metal oxides to become surface hydroxyl groups bing et al 2015 eq 5 two reactions may take place between o3 and surface hydroxyl groups in the first o3 directly binds to surface hydroxyl groups and then decomposes to reactive oxygen species ros in the second o3 displaces a surface hydroxyl group from the metal site at which it is activated directly in order to assess the prevalence of these pathways in our system the formation of active mn species on the surfaces of the catalysts during the hco process was tested by uv vis absorption spectrophotometry yan et al 2019 fig s13 a peak centered at 350 nm was observed in the p mno o3 system after 1 min fig s13 a corresponding to surface mn ii zhou et al 2021 this result showed that o3 could replace a surface hydroxyl group at an mn site of p mno and then decompose into ros with concomitant oxidation of mn ii during the following 30 min of reaction the surface mn ii concentration on the p mno did not increase indicating that the conversion of higher valence mn species back to mn ii was also taking place during the hco process eqs 9 12 however no obvious mn ii appeared on the surface of mn 4cn as shown in fig s13 b indicating that o3 is more likely to be decomposed by direct interaction with surface hydroxyl groups at mn sites yu et al 2020 in fact we cannot totally rule out the displacement of surface hydroxyl groups by o3 on the mn 4cn surface the absence of an mn ii peak may be due to the rapid supply of electrons by cn facilitating redox cycling of mn ii mn iii combining the uv vis xps and ftir results surface hydroxyl groups can be reasonably assumed to be the active sites for hco as expressed by eqs 7 and 8 7 mn ii oh mn ii o o 3 mn ii oh o 3 mn ii o o 3 8 mn ii oh o 3 mn ii o o 3 mn ii o ho 3 o 3 the positive synergistic effect exhibited by the bonding between mn and cn is not just reflected in the increase in active sites for the mn ncn catalysts the presence of diverse metal nonmetal bonds such as c n mn or c o mn might enhance electron transfer and facilitate the general ozone based chain reaction in hco processes therefore electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis tests were performed to analyze the electron transfer rate of mn 4cn cn c mno and mno2 as presented in fig 4 d mn 4cn exhibited the smaller semicircle in the nyquist eis plots suggesting the fast charge transfer rate of mn 4cn these observations validated that the interfacial electron transfer was accelerated by the electrical coordination of mno and cn in mn 4cn a series of in situ electrochemical experiments was conducted to further explore the synergistic effect between mno and cn in mn 4cn during the hco process in situ linear sweep voltammetry lsv tests fig 5 a showed mn 4cn to have a lower onset potential 0 3 v than p mno 0 38 v a higher current density was also observed for mn 4cn indicating that its surface bears more charges and is more prone to electron transfer processes gautam et al 2018 after o3 was added to the p mno and mn 4cn systems the current densities of both systems increased which proved occurrence of the oxidation reaction the increase in current density for mn 4cn o3 was obviously greater than that for p mno o3 indicating a more efficient electron transfer process on the surface of the former enhancing o3 decomposition zong et al 2020 when o3 and atz were simultaneously added to the p mno and mn 4cn systems the current densities did not show a further enhancement compared with the sole addition of o3 this not only corroborated negligible adsorption of atz on the catalyst surface but also implied that the degradation of atz in these systems proceeded through a radical process in solution rather than by an electron transfer process on the catalyst surface in situ eis analysis of p mno and mn 4cn fig 5 b yielded similar results as the lsv tests the nyquist eis plots for the mn 4cn o3 atz and mn 4cn o3 systems were similar but smaller than that for the mn 4cn system indicating that mn 4cn showed good conductivity and electron transfer properties during the hco process yang et al 2021 in situ i t tests on p mno and mn 4cn during the hco processes were also conducted and the results are presented in fig 5 c in these tests we measured the change of current upon adding o3 first then adding atz or adding atz first then adding o3 for both p mno and mn 4cn adding atz first did not cause an obvious change in the current indicating that the adsorption of atz was negligible and that there was no electron transfer between atz and the catalyst ahn et al 2019 wang et al 2019b zhao et al 2023 subsequent introduction of o3 led to obvious current fluctuations for both catalysts but more especially for mn 4cn these observations not only proved that o3 decomposition was more rapid on mn 4cn than on p mno but also proved that atz did not occupy surface active sites in ozonolytic decomposition applying the reverse addition sequence obvious current fluctuation was observed for both mn 4cn and p mno when only o3 was introduced into the solution clearly even if there is no pollutant in the system o3 can still adsorb on the catalyst surface and generate ros through electron transfer reaction subsequent introduction of atz into the system again induced current fluctuations for both mn 4cn and p mno mainly due to the enhanced o3 decomposition process induced by the rapid consumption of ros by atz considering that p mno also shows obvious o3 adsorption and activation ability and taking this together with the results of pyridine ftir fig 4 c and phosphate inhibition experiments fig s12 it is reasonable to assume that the mn sites on mn 4cn also acted as active sites and dominate o3 decomposition and ros generation according to the above results the synergistic effect of mn 4cn during the hco process was mainly manifested in two aspects in terms of material properties the electron rich mn sites can acquire electrons with the assistance of cn in terms of the catalytic process o3 can efficiently adsorb at electron rich mn sites and then harvest electrons thereby being converted into ros for atz degradation to further test whether the synergistic effects between the mn and cn were consistently demonstrated in repeated experiments shown in fig 2 c the xps characterization as well as the ftir spectroscopic analysis of fresh and used mn 4cn after four cycles were explicitly contrasted the c 1s n 1s o 1s mn 2p peaks and mn 3s of mn 4cn before and after hco were essentially unchanged as shown in figs 6 and s14 the change in c 1s was primarily due to a decrease in c n c o c and c o mn peaks which may be caused by the change in some unstable functional groups containing o or n in the hco system this could also explain the decrease in catalytic activity observed in repeated experiments the slight change in the n 1s peak differs from the results of other n doped carbon materials indicating that the presence of mn in the c n mn and other structures makes the n structures more stable in the hco system the change in the o 1s is most about the increase in lattice o and adsorbed molecular water and decrease in surface adsorbed oh groups due to the deprotonation of the surface hydroxyl group after hco as well as the loss of some unstable oh groups dong et al 2022b in addition a small portion of mn ii was converted into mn iii showing that the active site was electron rich mn ii which supplied electrons to ozone and oxidized to mn iii before obtaining electrons not only from the cn through c n mn and c o mn bonds but also through the radical reaction chain to reduce to mn ii as exhibit in eqs 9 14 with a view to confirming o3 adsorption on mn sites we conducted atr ftir tests but no obvious o3 adsorption signal was detected as shown in fig s15 this may have been because o3 decomposed as soon as it was adsorbed on the mn 4cn surface nevertheless it can be concluded that the decomposition of o3 on the mn 4cn surface was controlled by its mass transfer rate which proved the rapid o3 decomposition efficiency of mn 4cn in addition it is believed that electrons generated from the degraded pollutant could be re supplied to the electron rich mn sites through the cn as an electron transfer medium during this advanced oxidation process lyu et al 2023 zhang et al 2021a therefore the conversion of mn ii to mn iii could efficiently induce o3 decomposition and pollutant degradation while electrons provided by the degraded pollutant could also effectively promote the conversion of mn iii into mn ii with the assistance of cn in mn 4cn the xrd results shown in fig s16 and the ftir spectroscopy analysis shown in fig s17 were in line with the result of the xps of the used mn 4cn accordingly the similar results from different characterizations fully demonstrated the high efficiency and stability of the mn 4cn catalyst on the contrary the xrd patterns of the fresh and used p mno catalyst revealed great changes fig s18 abundant mn3o4 had formed in the used p mno sample indicating the unstable nature of this catalyst during the hco process considering the low catalytic activity of p mno three possible reasons may be invoked to account for its inferiority compared with mn 4cn 1 the surface of p mno lacks active sites due to the regular atom arrangement 2 surface mn ii are easily oxidized to higher valence mn species without the protection of cn 3 suppressed mn ii mn iii redox cycling and a lack of electron supply due to insufficient pollutant degradation therefore the mn ii mn iii redox cycling in mn 4cn not only makes this system more resistant to oxidizing conditions compared with p mno but also favors rapid o3 decomposition and atz degradation 9 mn ii o 3 mn ii o 2 o 2 10 mn ii o 2 h 2 o mn iii oh o h 11 mn iii e from cn mn ii 12 mn iii o 3 h 2 o mn ii oh ho 2 o 2 13 mn iii o 2 mn ii o 2 14 mn iii ho 2 mn ii h o 2 in summary although neither the sole mno nor the cn could achieve hco efficiency the synthesized mn ncn samples revealed new active sites by the generation of c n mn and c o mn bonds these types of active sites acted as electron rich mn ii sites and electron poor cn sites respectively the former sites offered electrons to ozone and drove the ozone decomposition processes while the later sites promoted the redox of mn by capturing the electron from the reaction systems therefore the synergistic effect between the cn and mno significantly enhanced the atz degradation efficiency in mn 4cn hco in addition other active sites on the surface of the mn 4cn such as defect structures also contributed to the promotion of hco 3 4 identification of ros of hco by mn cn to identify the ros and their contributions to the degradation of atz radical quenching experiments were performed traditional radical quenchers such as tert butanol tba elimination of oh k oh tba 6 108 m 1 s 1 luo et al 2021 sui et al 2011 p benzoquinone p bq elimination of o2 k o2 p bq 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 zhao et al 2022 and furfuryl alcohol ffa elimination of 1o2 k 1o2 ffa 1 108 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2020b were conducted on atz degradation in o3 alone and o3 mn 4cn process which are presented in fig 7 a tba is a strong scavenger for free oh but only has a reaction rate constant of 3 10 3 m 1 s 1 with ozone the degradation efficiency of atz decreased obviously in the presence of tba to 35 and 37 on o3 mn 4cn and o3 alone respectively which revealed oh was the main ros interestingly addition of p bq and ffa more significantly inhibited the atz degradation which presented that both o2 and 1o2 may existed in the system of mn 4cn hco furthermore the reaction rates of p bq k oh p bq 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 and ffa k oh ffa 1 5 1010 m 1 s 1 with oh are higher than tba guo et al 2022 besides the reaction rates of p bq k ozone p bq 2 5 103 m 1 s 1 and ffa k ozone ffa 1 6 103 m 1 s 1 with ozone are much higher than tba guo et al 2022 hence it could be assumed that ozone would be activated to produce ros such as oh at ph 7 solution but degradation of atz was rapidly inhibited by the addition of enough p bq or ffa the concentration of quencher is more than 100 times greater than the concentration of atz due to the rapid depletion of oh ozone and other ros by p bq or ffa electron paramagnetic resonance epr was utilized to further detected the generated ros for hco over atz degradation in this study 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrolin n oxide dmpo is used as a trapping agent for oh and o2 while 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp is used as a trapping agent for 1o2 consequently the characteristic spectra of the dmpo oh fig 7 b adducts with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 was observed in both o3 alone and o3 mn 4cn system xiao et al 2017 zhou et al 2022 furthermore the characteristic spectra of the temp 1o2 fig 7 c adducts with an intensity ratio of 1 1 1 was observed in both o3 alone and o3 mn 4cn system xu et al 2020 in addition the intensity of the dmpo oh and temp 1o2 were both increased significantly by the addition of mn 4cn catalyst and exhibited more oh and 1o2 produced in the mn 4cn hco however the signal intensity of dmpo o2 fig 7 d was the same with or without addition of mn 4cn catalyst and exhibited no more o2 produced in the mn 4cn hco song et al 2019b the intermediate ros on the surfaces of the catalysts during the hco process were examined by in situ raman spectroscopy fig 5 d in the presence of o3 two new peaks appeared for both the p mno o3 and mn 4cn o3 systems the peaks at 881 and 980 cm 1 could be assigned to adsorbed peroxide o2 and adsorbed atomic oxygen o respectively bing et al 2015 cheng et al 2023 these results suggested that o3 was adsorbed at mn sites directly at mn sites or indirectly at surface hydroxyl groups and was decomposed in situ into surface o2 and o the surface o2 and o then generated o2 and oh as has been corroborated by radical quenching experiments and epr tests in addition 1o2 acts as a mild and selective oxidizing species so that it hardly contributes to degrade the atz the rate constants for the reaction of atz with 1o2 k 1o2 atz 4 104 m 1 s 1 marchetti et al 2013 thus oh was the dominant ros during mn 4cn hco the rate constants for the reaction of atz with oh k oh atz 3 109 m 1 s 1 3 5 effect of water matrices 3 5 1 effect of catalysts dosage the effects of catalyst dosage initial ozone concentration solution ph and experimental ambient temperature for hco of mn 4cn were systematically evaluated the effects of mn 4cn dosage on the degradation of atz were investigated in fig 8 a the degradation efficiency of atz reached 85 4 and 86 5 in 20 min when the dosage of mn 4cn was 0 01 g l 1 and 0 02 g l 1 respectively moreover the degradation efficiency of atz reached almost 98 0 when the dosage of mn 4cn was increased to 0 03 g l 1 on further increasing the mn 4cn dosage to 0 04 g l 1 and 0 05 g l 1 the degradation efficiency of atz did not improve significantly typically increasing the catalyst dosage provides more surface active sites for o3 decomposition and ros generation however because the concentration of o3 was fixed in the solution an excessive amount of catalyst would lead to excess formation of ros instantaneously excess ros would react with o3 itself or atz intermediates severely impairing its likelihood of reacting with atz chen et al 2021 hence an mn 4cn dosage of 0 03 g l 1 was identified as optimal at an initial o3 concentration of 3 mg l 1 in the hco process excess catalyst dosage would not only increase the operating cost but also negatively affect the degradation efficiency 3 5 2 effect of ozone dosage the effect of ozone dosage to atz degradation by o3 alone and o3 mn 4cn is shown in fig 8 b when the dosage of ozone was 1 mg l 1 the degradation efficiency of atz was 18 3 at 20 min by o3 alone while the degradation efficiency of atz was 90 7 at 5 min by o3 mn 4cn further increases ozone dosage up to 3 mg l 1 and 5 mg l 1 obviously enhanced the atz degradation efficiency by o3 alone but had a negligible effect by o3 mn 4cn thus 3 mg l 1 ozone is a sufficiently high dosage for atz degradation in our system 3 5 3 effect of solution ph the degradation efficiencies of atz by o3 alone and o3 mn 4cn under various initial ph conditions ranging from 3 0 to 9 0 are illustrated in fig 8 c the presence of mn 4cn greatly promoted the degradation of atz at ph 3 0 to 9 0 similar to o3 mn 4cn degradation efficiency of atz by o3 alone is also in positive relation with the solution ph the point of zero charge phpzc of mn 4cn was determined to be 2 25 which was lower than all of the initial ph in general the catalyst surface gets protonated or deprotonated when the phpzc is above or below the solution ph hence the mn 4cn surface was most negatively charged which was beneficial to the adsorption of ozone in accordance with the results about the increasing degradation efficiency of atz by hco with the ph increase the more electrons ozone gained the more o3 was produced and further evolved into oh as shown in eqs 15 20 song et al 2021 meanwhile the phpzc of mn 4cn also influenced the atz pka 1 6 adsorption on the surface wang et al 2019a the negligible adsorption of atz on mn 4cn was caused by electrostatic repelling forces between the deprotonated mn 4cn and the negatively charged atz is in line with the adsorption experiment results 15 o 3 e o 3 16 o 3 h ho 3 17 ho 3 oh o 2 18 o 3 o h ho 4 19 ho 4 ho 2 o 2 20 ho 2 o 3 oh 2 o 2 3 5 4 effect of temperature the degradation of atz at different reaction temperatures by ozonation with and without the application of mn 4cn is presented in fig 8 d the degradation efficiency of atz was increased from 40 7 to 75 4 within 20 min in the absence of mn 4cn by raising the temperature from 283 k to 298 k while the degradation efficiency of atz increased to more than 98 6 within 5 min with the presence of mn 4cn when the temperature was raised to 298 k the degradation efficiency of atz at 283 k and 288 k was almost the same and the degradation efficiency of atz at 298 k was slightly higher therefore mn 4cn as a catalyst of hco had a wide range of reaction temperature adaptation 3 5 5 effect of carbonate inorganic anions such as bicarbonate hco3 eq 21 and carbonate co3 2 eq 22 were also employed as scavengers of oh at rate constants of 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 and 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 respectively eqs 23 and 24 ma et al 2005 tan et al 2013 in the presence of carbonate fig 8 e the atz degradation in the o3 alone processes was not affected by the introduction of carbonate while the degradation efficiency of atz greatly decreased to 48 8 1 mm na2co3 and 37 1 10 mm na2co3 in 20 min at ph 7 in o3 mn 4cn processes which was most likely as a result of the negative effects of the formation of carbonate or bicarbonate free radicals 21 h 2 c o 3 aq h hco 3 22 hco 3 h co 3 2 23 oh hco 3 co 3 h 2 o 24 oh co 3 2 co 3 o h 3 5 6 effect of nom there is much natural organic matter nom in natural waters and the different concentration of nom always affects the degradation of organic pollutants we used the model nom suwanee river natural organic matter srnom to see the effect of nom in o3 alone and o3 mn 4cn system on degradation of atz as can be seen from fig 8 f the addition of nom improved the degradation efficiency of atz by o3 alone however increasing the nom concentration from 1 mgc l 1 to 5 mgc l 1 reduced the atz degradation efficiency during the o3 alone process only from 69 9 to 55 7 in 20 min moreover only nom low concentration 1 mgc l 1 promoted the degradation of atz in the o3 mn 4cn system whereas increasing the concentration of nom up to 1 mgc l 1 accelerated the degradation efficiency of atz during o3 mn 4cn system up to 100 subsequently further increasing the concentration up to 5 mgc l 1 the degradation efficiency of atz in o3 mn 4cn system slowed down to 60 7 since the nom contains numerous functional groups that can act as radical initiators to react with ozone to generate ros and act as radical scavengers to compete with atz to react with ros such as oh 3 5 7 effect of real wastewater matrix the performance of the mn 4cn o3 system for atz degradation in real wastewater hfww was evaluated as shown in fig s19 the atz degradation rate was enhanced in hfww in both the uncatalyzed and catalyzed ozonation systems a considerable increase in the atz degradation extent was observed in hfww 62 compared to that in upw 41 for sole ozonation after 20 min which can be mainly attributed to the presence of dissolved organic matter dom oh et al 2017 the dom in the ozonation system acts as an initiator for the chain reaction of ozonation thus accelerating o3 decomposition and ros generation ding et al 2020 on the contrary the change in atz degradation rate after 1 min of reaction was negligible for the mn 4cn o3 system when upw 87 was replaced by hfww 95 proving the robust hco capacity of mn 4cn some researchers have reported similar results to those obtained here while some others have reported an inhibition of atz degradation in real wastewater guo et al 2018 petre et al 2013 yang et al 2022 this may be attributed to the effects of complex water matrices including doc concentration and types ph anions e g cl alkalinity and o3 and catalyst dosages therefore the reaction conditions of hco systems should be appropriately controlled in order to ensure the removal efficiency of refractory pollutants in real applications in general the mn 4cn hco is more resistant to the negative effect of water matrices on the degradation of atz when compared to sole ozonation the hco process of a low mn 4cn 0 03 g l 1 concentration can effectively degrade refractory organic pollutants despite the low temperature and low ozone dosage these findings demonstrate that mn 4cn is widely applicable for the hco process in various water matrices 3 6 acute toxicity of intermediates the acute toxicity assessments were carried out to compare o3 alone and o3 mn 4cn processes according to the relative luminescence intensity rli of luminescent bacteria i e vibrio qinghaiensis sp q67 in the sole ozonation process shown in fig 9 the luminescence intensity of the initial solution was 100 then the luminescence intensity did not decrease after 1 h reaction time while it decreased to 69 5 after 3 h reaction time this was because the selective oxidation of ozone with a redox potential of 2 07 ev was too hard to degrade atz and produce toxic by product in a short period of time in the o3 mn 4cn process for atz degradation the luminescence intensity sharply decreased after 1 h reaction 3 0 due to a large number of highly toxic intermediate products generated after the degradation of atz by oh whose redox potential is 2 70 ev meng et al 2022 subsequently the toxicity of the generated deeply oxidized intermediates was weakened and the luminescence intensity reached 99 4 after 3 h and reached 100 after 9 h 3 7 intermediates identification the formed atz products generated in the hco process were detected and identified based on mass spectra of ms and ms ms analyses seven products were identified and three possible transformation pathways were proposed table s6 and fig 10 in pathway ⅰ the dealkylation process initiate the degradation of atz the intermediates ceat cait and caat were formed by the attack of alkyl groups from both the atz lateral chain by ozone or oh which were further transformed into oaat through the de chlorination hydroxylation process in pathway ii atz was degraded directly through a de chlorination hydroxylation process yielding oeit which was then de alkylated to yield oait and oaat finally in pathway iii the degradation involved the alkylic hydroxylation process cnit was formed by the replacement of a side chain hydrogen atom of atz with a hydroxyl group 3 8 enhanced mn cn hco mechanism according to the front discussion the possible reaction mechanism of mn 4cn hco is illustrated in fig 11 since the surface adsorption of atz on mn 4cn is not the main way to removal atz the high degradation efficiency of atz is attributed to the decomposition of ozone on the surface of the mn 4cn to generate ros as the electron rich mn ii center and mn 4cn surface hydroxyl group were the catalytic active sites the generated oh was the main ros and o2 as well as 1o2 were also generated during the radical chain reaction of the hco the electron rich mn ii center acted as the catalytic active sites to transfer electrons to ozone and then furtherly generate oh to attack atz followed by the formation of surface mn iii meanwhile the reduction of mn iii to mn ii occurred by obtaining electrons not only from the cn through c n mn and c o mn bonds but also through the ozone decomposition chain reaction in addition the surface hydroxyl groups formed by chemisorbed water molecules on the mn sites can adsorb ozone and generate oh to attack atz 4 conclusion the mno dispersed on cn mn ncn was successfully fabricated via a facile calcination process by using mno2 and 2 6 dap as precursors compared with sole mno and cn activity in hco processes respectively the synergistic effects between mno and cn in mn ncn achieved significantly refractory organic pollutant degradation electron rich mn ii centers and electron poor cn sites are considered as the main active sites created by the formation of c n mn and c o mn bonds various ros including oh 1o2 as well as o2 were generated during the hco processes and oh mainly drive the atz degradation mn ncn exhibited robust activity over a wide ph range temperature carbonate and nom concentration the catalytic activity of mn ncn remained almost constant after four consecutive cycles and the leaching of mn ions was insignificant mn ncn was an effective and promising catalyst which was suitable

15164,in this study manganese oxide mno dispersed on cn mn ncn was fabricated as a catalyst in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation hco achieving excellent catalytic performance on refractory organic pollutant degradation via the synergistic effects between mno and cn the study demonstrated that the c n mn and c o mn bonds constructed in the catalyst linking mno and cn created the synergistic effects which could overcome typical problems such as metal leaching etc the c n mn and c o mn bonds could promote electron transfer from cation π reactions to form electron rich mn ii sites and electron poor cn sites the electron rich mn ii sites as active sites supplied electrons to ozone which then further evolved into reactive oxygen species ros the electron poor cn sites captured electrons from the pollutant intermediate radicals to electron rich mn ii sites via cation π reactions with the help of c n mn and c o mn bonds which promote the redox reactions of mn the surface hydroxyl groups also participated in ozone decomposition and ros production additionally oh was the dominant ros of the mn ncn hco processes this study presents the excellent hco performance of mn ncn as well as provides views on the electron transfer route between the catalyst pollutant and ozone which is crucial for the design of the catalyst graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords catalytic ozonation mno cn synergistic effect atrazine data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction heterogeneous catalytic ozonation hco has been extensively applied in water treatment field due to its robustly refractory organic pollutant degradation ability the property of the catalyst is crucial in determining the efficiency of hco chen and wang 2021 ikhlaq et al 2013 kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 li and wang 2020 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 song et al 2022 wang and chen 2020 yu et al 2020 numerous studies have been carried out to

and hu 2018 etc and metal metal oxides loaded on supports e g co n cnts wang et al 2021b and fe pumice yuan et al 2016 etc were frequently employed catalysts among them manganese oxides are frequently studied as outstanding catalysts due to their highly catalytic activities eco friendliness as well as wide dispersion in nature the combination of manganese oxides with non metallic materials could significantly improve the efficiency of hco by suppressing the metal leaching problem overcoming the high energy barrier from the reduction of m n m to mn m metal species and preventing the agglomeration of ultrafine metal oxide nanoparticles in solution for instance tian et al 2021 reported that a mn loaded biochar mnox biochar catalyst demonstrated excellent hco activity xu et al 2019 synthesized a heterogeneous solid catalyst mno2 nh2 go through amino functionalized hybrid of mno2 and go with the hydrothermal method to efficiently degrade cephalexin therefore combining manganese oxides with non metallic materials is a good way to achieve excellent hco performance to date mn iv is the predominantly studied oxidation state which plays a crucial role in redox or radical reactions while few studies focus on the role of mn ii in hco processes wang et al 2019c developed novel mn ii bonded oxidized carbon nanotubes mn ii ocnts which acted as an efficient hco catalyst interestingly this catalyst achieved hco activity by reversible desorption and adsorption of mn ii on oxidized carbon nanotube ocnt surfaces which actually works as homogeneous processes to the best of our knowledge the catalytic activity induced by heterogeneous mn ii based catalysts in hco processes has not been reported compared with commonly studied mn iv oxide mn ii oxide is more easily dispersed on the surface of nonmetallic materials and has stronger anti agglomeration ability yang et al 2014 in addition in the oxidation system the redox cycle of mn ii mn iii is more accessible than that of mn iv mn iii liu et al 2018b considering the beneficial effect of the interaction between heterogeneous mn ii based catalysts and carbonaceous materials it was deemed desirable to combine manganese oxide mno with carbonaceous materials with reliable heterogeneous catalytic ozonation hco capacity in this work mno dispersed on carbon nitride material denoted as mn cn has been successfully fabricated the resultant catalyst displayed high activity and durability in degradation of the persistent herbicide atrazine atz through an hco process dong et al 2022a series catalysts with various loading amounts of mno denoted as mn ncn were synthesized to investigate the synergistic hco effect between mno and cn the c o mn and c n mn bonds generated between mn ii oxide and cn were considered as the main active sites explored by several characterizations in addition the catalytic activity reactive oxygen species ros generation and hco mechanism of mn ncn were well investigated the possible degradation intermediates and their acute toxicity were also determined 2 experimental sections 2 1 reagents and materials the reagents and materials used are listed in text s1 2 2 preparation of catalyst 2 2 1 synthesis of mno2 a facile synthesis of mno2 through 100 ml na2s2o3 aqueous solution 0 376 m was introduced dropwise to 500 ml kmno4 solution 0 2 m under stirring and aged for 2 h at 60 c eq 1 the resulting precipitate was rinsed with ultrapure water upw at least three times and dried at 110 c for 12 h subsequently the precursor was calcined under an argon atmosphere at 400 c for 4 h with a heating rate of 5 c min 1 to obtain the pristine mno2 material 1 8 mno 4 3 s 2 o 3 2 h 2 o 8 mn o 2 6 so 4 2 2 o h 2 2 2 synthesis of mn ncn mn ncn catalysts were synthesized via a facile in situ impregnation carbonization method certain amount of mno2 was mixed with 2 6 diaminopyridine 2 6 dap and upw under different molar ratios then sonicated for 1 h to form a uniformly dispersed suspension subsequently the suspension was air dried at 80 c to obtain the precursor denoted as mn ndap where n represented the molar ratio of 2 6 dap to mno2 n 0 1 0 5 1 4 5 8 and 10 next the dried mn ndap powders were placed in a tube furnace and calcined under an argon atmosphere at 450 c for 3 h with a heating rate of 3 c min 1 the final obtained samples were denoted as mn ncn for comparison the 2 6 dap treated by the same procedure with the exception of adding mno2 was denoted as cn both commercial mno denoted as c mno and prepared mno p mno have been tested as reference catalysts the method used to obtain p mno was similar to that reported previously fu et al 2021 for the reductive synthesis of mn ncn 2 3 characterization the characterization of the prepared catalysts involved are listed in text s2 2 4 catalytic ozonation procedure a laboratory ozone generator 3s a5 tonglin beijing china was used to generate ozone from high pure oxygen 99 9 stock solutions of ozone were obtained through a stainless steel porous aeration diffuser bubbling ozone into the bottom of the cylindrical reactor height 35 cm diameter 9 cm actual volume 2 l containing upw at 4 c for 30 min the stock solutions of ozone concentrations were determined directly by a uv vis spectrometer t6 persee beijing china at 260 nm ε 3200 m 1 cm 1 the hco procedures were conducted in batch mode in a 150 ml in house laboratory made reactor with a water bath all experiments were performed at 10 c excluding the effect of the temperature experiment and solution ph was adjusted with hclo4 and naoh wang et al 2018 reactions were initiated by adding pre determined volumes of the ozone stock solution 3 mg l 1 of initial ozone dosage after bubbling into definite amounts of the solutions 5 μm atz and 30 mg l 1 catalysts at given time intervals samples were extracted and filtered with ptfe syringe filters pore size 0 22 μm before analyzing the residual atz and ozone concentrations moreover dissolved ozone in the samples was quenched with 20 μl of 12 5 g l 1 na2s2o3 solution to simulate atz degradation in a more realistic water matrix secondary effluent from a real wastewater treatment plant wwtp was collected from hengfeng wwtp in deqing china the collected water sample denoted as hfww was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and then spiked with atz to 5 μm prior to use the main characteristics of the water sample are presented in table s1 2 5 analytical method the analytical method employed are shown in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 textural properties of catalysts x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the prepared mn ncn n 0 5 4 8 and cn are displayed in fig 1 a it is worth noting that the prepared mn ncn agrees well with the mno jcpds no 07 0230 rather than mno2 without any other peaks implying that high purity mno was effectively formed wang et al 2015 since the precursor of mno used in this study was pure mno2 fig s1 the possible transformation process of mno2 to mno should be well investigated after drying processes at 80 c the crystal phase of the obtained mn 4dap fig s2 was found to match well with a mixture of 2 6 dap jcpds no 41 1765 mno2 jcpds no 81 1947 and mn3o4 jcpds no 24 0734 indicating that partial mn iv in mno2 had been transformed into mn ii and mn iii in the subsequent calcination process the mixture of mno2 and mn3o4 is further converted into mno fu et al 2018 liu et al 2015 we assumed that 2 6 dap might act as a strong reductant during the synthesis which reduces mn iv to mn ii to prove this supposition a mn 0 1cn sample was prepared by adding excessive mno2 and insufficient 2 6 dap the obtained sample fig s3 revealed a mixture phase of mn3o4 and mno2 therefore the possible transformation process of mno2 to mno follows eqs 2 and 3 during the calcination process fu et al 2018 2 3 mn o 2 c 2 6 dap m n 3 o 4 c o 2 3 2 m n 3 o 4 c 2 6 dap 6 mno c o 2 thermal gravimetric analysis tga and differential thermal analysis dta of mn 4dap in an argon flow are shown in fig s4 the weight loss at 70 c 240 c is assigned to the evaporation of residual h2o and partial organic precursors while the weight loss at 240 c 450 c represents the evaporation of the remainder of the organic precursors increasing the pyrolysis temperature to 1000 c only caused 10 more weight loss suggesting the 450 c pyrolysis temperature is suitable for the formation of the stable mn ncn structure as shown in fig 1 a the synthesized cn sample revealed a broad peak at ca 26 which is assigned to the typical graphitic interlayer 002 peak gao et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 however such a peak was not abundant in the mn ncn samples since the xrd patterns were acquired from exposed surface crystallite planes of the samples the invisible graphitic peak might be due to the cover layer of mno or the different formation of cn in the mn ncn samples to clarify the detailed reason the morphology and nanostructures of the catalysts were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem the as formed mn 4cn fig 1 b presented as regular elliptic nanoparticles with longitudinal length of 250 nm 300 nm and a transverse diameter of 70 nm 90 nm which is similar to the other mn ncn samples but different from the mno2 as circular nanoparticles fig s5 a the cn sample displayed a dense honeycomb structural morphology fig s5 d the hrtem image of the mn 4cn fig 1 c revealed a high degree of crystallized mno nanoparticles which were closely connected to amorphous cn this may be the reason why a strong graphitic peak appeared in the cn sample but disappeared in the mn ncn samples the mno nanoparticles with a diameter of 8 nm presented clear lattice fringes with distances of 0 222 nm fig 1 c yellow arrows which were well indexed to the 200 plane energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds of cn and mno in mn 4cn were presented in fig 1 d c yellow n red o blue and mn green were all uniformly dispersed within the composite therefore the as prepared mn ncn was universally performed by mno nanoparticles supported on cn elliptic nanoparticles fig s6 shows the pore structures and pore size distributions of prepared mn ncn n 0 5 4 8 and cn samples typical type iv patterns with a h3 hysteresis loop of mn ncn proved its mesopores structure the specific surface area s bet pore volumes and diameters of prepared catalysts were recorded in table 1 it is obvious that the s bet of mno2 is 90 4 m2 g 1 higher than those of mn 0 5cn 18 8 m2 g 1 mn 4cn 11 0 m2 g 1 mn 8cn 7 9 m2 g 1 and cn 2 2 m2 g 1 consequently the doping of mn oxides increased the surface area of the cn composites large s bet and mesopores structure induced more exposed active sites which is beneficial to reduce mass diffusion limit shortening the path for removing organic pollution to allow better catalytic performance although the limited s bet of cn was undesirable for catalyst processes the specific interaction between mno and cn might promote catalytic ability such as by enhancing the dispersion of mno and reducing the diameter of mno the detailed enhanced catalytic mechanism of mn ncn will be discussed below in addition all the mn ncn revealed low pore volumes table 1 suggesting the hco processes mainly occurred on the surface of mn 4cn rather than in the pore or channel 3 2 hco performance of catalysts fig 2 a shows the degradation of atz by sole ozonation o3 alone hco with as prepared mno2 o3 mno2 cn o3 cn mn 4cn o3 mn 4cn p mno o3 p mno and c mno o3 c mno the adsorption ability of mn 4cn for atz adsorption was first measured to serve as a benchmark for the following hco processes mn 4cn exhibited slight adsorption to atz 5 after 20 min which might be due to its relatively low s bet only 40 7 of the atz was degraded by o3 alone indicating that atz is refractory in this reaction system hco by mn 4cn achieved the highest atz degradation efficiency of 98 0 which is higher than that by mno2 54 3 depicting the advantages of cn modification to investigate the roles of mno and cn in mn ncn during the hco process the atz degradation efficiencies of p mno c mno and the prepared cn were separately tested none of these three catalysts effectively improved the atz degradation efficiency alone 42 8 43 1 and 48 4 respectively revealing the operation of a synergistic effect between mno and cn in mn 4cn for hco of atz the pollutant degradation efficiency of mn 4cn was superior or comparable to those of some typical hco catalysts reported previously table s2 in addition measurements of total organic carbon toc removal with ozone o3 and o3 mn 4cn showed little variation after 20 min fig s7 due to the inadequate o3 dosage for mineralization atz o3 5 62 5 molar ratio to investigate the effect of mno cn ratio on mn ncn synthesis and the associated hco activity various mn ncn catalysts with different proportions of cn and mno n 0 1 0 5 1 4 5 8 and 10 were synthesized by using different molar ratios of 2 6 dap to mno2 as shown in fig 2 b the atz degradation efficiency gradually enhanced when n increased from 0 1 to 0 5 and then reached a plateau of high efficiency degradation of 98 0 n 1 and 4 when n increased to 5 and 8 the degradation efficiency was decreased to 86 2 and 71 7 respectively while n 10 the degradation rate decreased to 53 1 which was very close to the hco by the prepared cn o3 decomposition efficiencies over various mn ncn catalysts accompany with the atz degradation efficiencies fig 2 b are displayed in fig s8 with the increase of cn content the o3 decomposition rate gradually decreased indicating that the main active sites for ozonation activation are mn sites rather than cn structures the results further indicated that the catalytic capacities of the mn ncn were not simply dependent on the contents of mno and cn combined with xrd analysis fig s3 the poor performance of mn 0 1cn may have been due to the formation of mn3o4 and mno2 rather than mno excessive cn as in mn 8cn also did not result in satisfactory hco performance which may have been due to the drastically decreased s bet table 1 or the lack of active sites provided by mno therefore only certain ratios of mno cn n 0 5 1 and 4 result in high hco performance and the mechanism underpinning these findings is explored in section 3 3 we performed catalyst cycle tests as well as mn leaching tests to evaluate the stability of the catalysts and determine the mn ion dissolution the degradation of atz by hco using reused mn 4cn is depicted in fig 2 c the second third and fourth use of the mn 4cn show the atz degradation decreased from 98 0 to 96 5 93 7 and 91 6 in a 20 min reaction respectively witnessing a gradual slight decline in mn 4cn performance for hco moreover the mn ion released from mn 4cn after hco was determined according to fig 2 d it was found that only 11 μg l 1 of mn ii were measured after 20 min reaction at ph 7 following that mn ion leaching from mn 4cn increased slightly in the second cycle with mn ion concentrations reaching 16 μg l 1 after the third and fourth cycles only 7 μg l 1 and 4 μg l 1 of the mn ion were detected in the solution because the dosage of mn 4cn during the reaction was 30 mg l 1 and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes analysis revealed that the content of the mn species in mn 4cn was 32 22 wt table s3 the maximum amount of dissolution only contributed 0 17 of the mn dose as a result the leaching of manganese ions on the experiment could be ignored the synergistic effect between mno and cn it is assumed effectively prevented mn species from leaching during the hco considering the degradation efficiency the cost of materials and the unavoidable problem of metal dissolution mn 4cn was chosen as the optimum catalyst and the mn ncn n 0 5 and 8 catalysts were used as supplements for the following investigation to explore the mechanism of the enhanced hco effect 3 3 synergistic role of mno and cn full scan x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectra of mn ncn and cn are shown in fig s9 in which the observed peaks c 1s n 1s o 1s and mn 2p and 3s exclude cn indicate the presence of mn exclude cn o n and c elements table s3 lists the mn contents in each mn ncn sample calculated theoretically and measured by xps and icp oes briefly the mn contents in each mn ncn sample followed the order icp oes xps theoretical calculation the lowest mn contents obtained by theoretical calculation may be due to the loss of carbonaceous components during pyrolysis of the actual samples besides the higher mn contents detected by icp oes compared to xps may be due to the different detection depths and areas nassr et al 2013 xps provides information on the surfaces of samples while icp oes yields bulk information according to fesem and hrtem inspection the mno in mn 4cn is present as nanoparticles whereas cn adopts an amorphous structure therefore it can be concluded that more cn was exposed on the surface of mn ncn than mn tables s4 and s5 list the valence states and existing forms of elemental mn c n and o with the help of deconvolution analysis the mn 2p spectrum of mn ncn fig 3 a contained three peaks at 640 9 ev 644 5 ev and 653 ev which could be assigned to mn ii 2p3 2 satellite structure and mn ii 2p1 2 respectively chu et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 the binding energy difference es between the doublet peaks of mn 2p was 12 1 ev indicating that the mn species in these catalysts were in the mn ii oxidation state attributed to the formation of mno of mn ncn n 0 5 4 8 furthermore the es between the doublet peaks of mn 3s can be used to estimate the real average oxidation state aos of the surface mn in the mn ncn mn 4dap c mno and mno2 using the following equation eq 4 and the detailed values were shown in table s4 galakhov et al 2002 zhu et al 2021 4 aos 8 956 1 126 es as shown in fig 3 b the aos of mn ncn n 0 5 4 8 and c mno were both 2 further confirming the existence of mno and absence of amorphous mno2 for the prepared mn ncn in contrast the aos for mno2 was 4 fig s10 suggesting the high purity of mno2 the aos for mn 4dap was 3 20 fig s11 indicating that part of the mn was reduced by the drying processes which is consistent with the xrd characterization of mn 4dap fig s2 more importantly the mn 2p3 2 peak of mn ncn which had a binding energy of 641 5 ev compared to that of c mno changed towards a lower binding energy indicating that electrons had transferred from cn to mno as shown in fig 3 c the c 1s xps of cn could be divided into three peaks attributed to the formation of c c c c 284 6 ev c n 285 8 ev and c o c 286 7 ev respectively feng et al 2020 wang et al 2015 xiao et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 a new peak at 288 6 ev was ascribed to c o mn of mn ncn chen et al 2012 the n 1s xps spectrum was deconvoluted into three peaks with the binding energies of 398 2 ev 399 6 ev and 400 5 ev for pyridinic n mn n and pyrrolic n respectively fig 3 d jiang et al 2020 song et al 2019a wang et al 2021a zhu et al 2018 in contrast to mn ncn no mn n peak could be observed in the sole cn the detailed content of surface elements for various catalysts were shown in table s5 combined with the c 1s and n 1s analysis mno was bonded to c n heterocycles via c n mn and c o mn in mn n complexation rather than a simple mixture xie et al 2022 the structures offer the polarization differences of components on material surface generating electron rich center and electron poor center and increasing the possibility of charge transfer of π cation σ donation lyu et al 2018 mahadevi and sastry 2013 zhang et al 2019 the cn aromatic rings formed bonds with mno creating a mn ii π interaction via the c n mn and c o mn bonding bridge shifting the π electrons on the surface of mn ncn to the mn center effectively changing the surface electron distribution and encouraging the formation of electron rich mn centers according to fig 3 e the high resolution o 1s spectrum of mn ncn and c mno could be divided into three peaks respectively including lattice o olat 529 9 ev surface adsorbed oh groups ooh 531 2 ev and adsorbed molecular water oh2o 533 2 ev lin et al 2021 yu et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 moreover the cn only had one adsorbed molecular water peak which could be due to water adsorption during air exposure according to the literature metal oxide surface adsorbed oh groups may act as active sites to promote ozone decomposition and oh formation thereby promoting pollutant degradation ma et al 2005 therefore the xps results showed that the c n mn and c o mn structures electron rich mn ii centers and surface adsorbed oh groups co existed in mn cn catalysts to further pinpoint the active sites of the mn ncn catalysts and demonstrate the synergistic effect of mn and cn on hco a series of surface properties were characterized fig 4 a shows the raman spectra for mn 4cn and cn the peak at 647 cm 1 which is characteristic of mn o vibrational bands was also observed for mn 4cn confirming the presence of mno in the mn 4cn feng et al 2020 zhu et al 2018 the peak at 1384 cm 1 assigned to the typical d band which represents characteristic features of disordered carbon or defective graphitic structures while the peak at 1603 cm 1 is typical g band which represents characteristic features of graphitic layers yang et al 2014 the ratio of d band g band intensities i d i g can reflect the defect levels the i d i g band intensity ratio of mn 4cn was 1 394 which was somewhat higher than the sole cn 1 158 revealing that the interaction between mno2 and 2 6 dap through high temperature reaction increased the degree of defects according to xrd results fig 1 a the full widths at half maximum of the mno peaks in the mn 4cn sample were broader than those of c mno indicating lower crystallinity the low crystallinity meant that the mno component in the mn 4cn sample contained more defects which made it easier for mn sites to participate in the hco reaction and undergo valence transition in the redox process wang et al 2020a according to fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis shown in fig 4 b a new peak at about 665 cm 1 appeared in all samples but the cn was assigned to the bending vibration of mn o wang et al 2022 the bands at about 3400 cm 1 were assigned to the characteristic peaks of the surface hydroxyl groups or water in stretching mode qi and xie 2018 the addition of mn species in mn ncn promoted an increase in peak intensity at about 3400 cm 1 due to the increased hydroxyl groups adsorption on metal sites which was beneficial to the adsorption of ozone besides the peak at about 1600 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of c n and c c as well as surface hydroxyl groups bending vibration hu et al 2017 qi and xie 2018 the peak stretching at about 1400 cm 1 was a characteristic due to c n and c o jothinathan et al 2022 wang et al 2022 the polar group peaks such as c n c o could promote the polarization difference to form an electron rich mn center through c o mn and c n mn according to a previous study pyridine ftir was applied to analysis the amount and categories of surface acid sites fig 4 c illustrates the pyridine ftir over mn 4cn at 423 k and 623 k obviously two strong ir bands appeared at 1452 cm 1 and 1604 cm 1 were assigned to the presence of strong lewis acid the band at 1495 cm 1 represents to both lewis and bronsted acid sites the surface of mn 4cn exposed abundant total acid sites 47 7 μmol g 1 and medium strong acid sites 20 9 μmol g 1 according to yu et al 2020 the primary lewis acid sites in the majority of hco studies involving metal oxides catalysts were the metal components covered by hydroxyl groups particularly transition metals on the catalyst surface with surface hydroxyl groups acting as active sites as a strong lewis base phosphate could be applied to evaluate whether the lewis acid sites were the catalytic active centers for hco numerous studies have revealed that phosphate has a strong affinity for the surface lewis acid sites of catalysts can replace their surface hydroxyl groups and ultimately prevent ozone from being activated eqs 7 and 8 in addition phosphate also serves as a scavenger for oh and their reaction rate constants k oh h2po4 2 104 m 1 s 1 k oh hpo4 2 1 5 105 m 1 s 1 are much lower than those of atz and oh k oh atz 3 109 m 1 s 1 sui et al 2012 wang et al 2019a as shown in fig s12 the atz degradation efficiency was remarkably suppressed by adding 1 μm phosphate which decreased by 40 compared with that in hco without phosphate at 20 min when adding up the phosphate concentration to 1 mm into the o3 mn 4cn process about 45 3 atz was decomposed at 20 min which was almost the same as the degradation efficiency that the o3 alone process could reach 45 8 the results implied that catalytic capacity of mn 4cn is totally inhibited according to eqs 5 and 6 5 m n 2 o h m n 2 oh 6 mn oh po 4 3 mn po 4 2 o h it is generally accepted that the dissociated water molecules adsorb on metal oxides to become surface hydroxyl groups bing et al 2015 eq 5 two reactions may take place between o3 and surface hydroxyl groups in the first o3 directly binds to surface hydroxyl groups and then decomposes to reactive oxygen species ros in the second o3 displaces a surface hydroxyl group from the metal site at which it is activated directly in order to assess the prevalence of these pathways in our system the formation of active mn species on the surfaces of the catalysts during the hco process was tested by uv vis absorption spectrophotometry yan et al 2019 fig s13 a peak centered at 350 nm was observed in the p mno o3 system after 1 min fig s13 a corresponding to surface mn ii zhou et al 2021 this result showed that o3 could replace a surface hydroxyl group at an mn site of p mno and then decompose into ros with concomitant oxidation of mn ii during the following 30 min of reaction the surface mn ii concentration on the p mno did not increase indicating that the conversion of higher valence mn species back to mn ii was also taking place during the hco process eqs 9 12 however no obvious mn ii appeared on the surface of mn 4cn as shown in fig s13 b indicating that o3 is more likely to be decomposed by direct interaction with surface hydroxyl groups at mn sites yu et al 2020 in fact we cannot totally rule out the displacement of surface hydroxyl groups by o3 on the mn 4cn surface the absence of an mn ii peak may be due to the rapid supply of electrons by cn facilitating redox cycling of mn ii mn iii combining the uv vis xps and ftir results surface hydroxyl groups can be reasonably assumed to be the active sites for hco as expressed by eqs 7 and 8 7 mn ii oh mn ii o o 3 mn ii oh o 3 mn ii o o 3 8 mn ii oh o 3 mn ii o o 3 mn ii o ho 3 o 3 the positive synergistic effect exhibited by the bonding between mn and cn is not just reflected in the increase in active sites for the mn ncn catalysts the presence of diverse metal nonmetal bonds such as c n mn or c o mn might enhance electron transfer and facilitate the general ozone based chain reaction in hco processes therefore electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis tests were performed to analyze the electron transfer rate of mn 4cn cn c mno and mno2 as presented in fig 4 d mn 4cn exhibited the smaller semicircle in the nyquist eis plots suggesting the fast charge transfer rate of mn 4cn these observations validated that the interfacial electron transfer was accelerated by the electrical coordination of mno and cn in mn 4cn a series of in situ electrochemical experiments was conducted to further explore the synergistic effect between mno and cn in mn 4cn during the hco process in situ linear sweep voltammetry lsv tests fig 5 a showed mn 4cn to have a lower onset potential 0 3 v than p mno 0 38 v a higher current density was also observed for mn 4cn indicating that its surface bears more charges and is more prone to electron transfer processes gautam et al 2018 after o3 was added to the p mno and mn 4cn systems the current densities of both systems increased which proved occurrence of the oxidation reaction the increase in current density for mn 4cn o3 was obviously greater than that for p mno o3 indicating a more efficient electron transfer process on the surface of the former enhancing o3 decomposition zong et al 2020 when o3 and atz were simultaneously added to the p mno and mn 4cn systems the current densities did not show a further enhancement compared with the sole addition of o3 this not only corroborated negligible adsorption of atz on the catalyst surface but also implied that the degradation of atz in these systems proceeded through a radical process in solution rather than by an electron transfer process on the catalyst surface in situ eis analysis of p mno and mn 4cn fig 5 b yielded similar results as the lsv tests the nyquist eis plots for the mn 4cn o3 atz and mn 4cn o3 systems were similar but smaller than that for the mn 4cn system indicating that mn 4cn showed good conductivity and electron transfer properties during the hco process yang et al 2021 in situ i t tests on p mno and mn 4cn during the hco processes were also conducted and the results are presented in fig 5 c in these tests we measured the change of current upon adding o3 first then adding atz or adding atz first then adding o3 for both p mno and mn 4cn adding atz first did not cause an obvious change in the current indicating that the adsorption of atz was negligible and that there was no electron transfer between atz and the catalyst ahn et al 2019 wang et al 2019b zhao et al 2023 subsequent introduction of o3 led to obvious current fluctuations for both catalysts but more especially for mn 4cn these observations not only proved that o3 decomposition was more rapid on mn 4cn than on p mno but also proved that atz did not occupy surface active sites in ozonolytic decomposition applying the reverse addition sequence obvious current fluctuation was observed for both mn 4cn and p mno when only o3 was introduced into the solution clearly even if there is no pollutant in the system o3 can still adsorb on the catalyst surface and generate ros through electron transfer reaction subsequent introduction of atz into the system again induced current fluctuations for both mn 4cn and p mno mainly due to the enhanced o3 decomposition process induced by the rapid consumption of ros by atz considering that p mno also shows obvious o3 adsorption and activation ability and taking this together with the results of pyridine ftir fig 4 c and phosphate inhibition experiments fig s12 it is reasonable to assume that the mn sites on mn 4cn also acted as active sites and dominate o3 decomposition and ros generation according to the above results the synergistic effect of mn 4cn during the hco process was mainly manifested in two aspects in terms of material properties the electron rich mn sites can acquire electrons with the assistance of cn in terms of the catalytic process o3 can efficiently adsorb at electron rich mn sites and then harvest electrons thereby being converted into ros for atz degradation to further test whether the synergistic effects between the mn and cn were consistently demonstrated in repeated experiments shown in fig 2 c the xps characterization as well as the ftir spectroscopic analysis of fresh and used mn 4cn after four cycles were explicitly contrasted the c 1s n 1s o 1s mn 2p peaks and mn 3s of mn 4cn before and after hco were essentially unchanged as shown in figs 6 and s14 the change in c 1s was primarily due to a decrease in c n c o c and c o mn peaks which may be caused by the change in some unstable functional groups containing o or n in the hco system this could also explain the decrease in catalytic activity observed in repeated experiments the slight change in the n 1s peak differs from the results of other n doped carbon materials indicating that the presence of mn in the c n mn and other structures makes the n structures more stable in the hco system the change in the o 1s is most about the increase in lattice o and adsorbed molecular water and decrease in surface adsorbed oh groups due to the deprotonation of the surface hydroxyl group after hco as well as the loss of some unstable oh groups dong et al 2022b in addition a small portion of mn ii was converted into mn iii showing that the active site was electron rich mn ii which supplied electrons to ozone and oxidized to mn iii before obtaining electrons not only from the cn through c n mn and c o mn bonds but also through the radical reaction chain to reduce to mn ii as exhibit in eqs 9 14 with a view to confirming o3 adsorption on mn sites we conducted atr ftir tests but no obvious o3 adsorption signal was detected as shown in fig s15 this may have been because o3 decomposed as soon as it was adsorbed on the mn 4cn surface nevertheless it can be concluded that the decomposition of o3 on the mn 4cn surface was controlled by its mass transfer rate which proved the rapid o3 decomposition efficiency of mn 4cn in addition it is believed that electrons generated from the degraded pollutant could be re supplied to the electron rich mn sites through the cn as an electron transfer medium during this advanced oxidation process lyu et al 2023 zhang et al 2021a therefore the conversion of mn ii to mn iii could efficiently induce o3 decomposition and pollutant degradation while electrons provided by the degraded pollutant could also effectively promote the conversion of mn iii into mn ii with the assistance of cn in mn 4cn the xrd results shown in fig s16 and the ftir spectroscopy analysis shown in fig s17 were in line with the result of the xps of the used mn 4cn accordingly the similar results from different characterizations fully demonstrated the high efficiency and stability of the mn 4cn catalyst on the contrary the xrd patterns of the fresh and used p mno catalyst revealed great changes fig s18 abundant mn3o4 had formed in the used p mno sample indicating the unstable nature of this catalyst during the hco process considering the low catalytic activity of p mno three possible reasons may be invoked to account for its inferiority compared with mn 4cn 1 the surface of p mno lacks active sites due to the regular atom arrangement 2 surface mn ii are easily oxidized to higher valence mn species without the protection of cn 3 suppressed mn ii mn iii redox cycling and a lack of electron supply due to insufficient pollutant degradation therefore the mn ii mn iii redox cycling in mn 4cn not only makes this system more resistant to oxidizing conditions compared with p mno but also favors rapid o3 decomposition and atz degradation 9 mn ii o 3 mn ii o 2 o 2 10 mn ii o 2 h 2 o mn iii oh o h 11 mn iii e from cn mn ii 12 mn iii o 3 h 2 o mn ii oh ho 2 o 2 13 mn iii o 2 mn ii o 2 14 mn iii ho 2 mn ii h o 2 in summary although neither the sole mno nor the cn could achieve hco efficiency the synthesized mn ncn samples revealed new active sites by the generation of c n mn and c o mn bonds these types of active sites acted as electron rich mn ii sites and electron poor cn sites respectively the former sites offered electrons to ozone and drove the ozone decomposition processes while the later sites promoted the redox of mn by capturing the electron from the reaction systems therefore the synergistic effect between the cn and mno significantly enhanced the atz degradation efficiency in mn 4cn hco in addition other active sites on the surface of the mn 4cn such as defect structures also contributed to the promotion of hco 3 4 identification of ros of hco by mn cn to identify the ros and their contributions to the degradation of atz radical quenching experiments were performed traditional radical quenchers such as tert butanol tba elimination of oh k oh tba 6 108 m 1 s 1 luo et al 2021 sui et al 2011 p benzoquinone p bq elimination of o2 k o2 p bq 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 zhao et al 2022 and furfuryl alcohol ffa elimination of 1o2 k 1o2 ffa 1 108 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2020b were conducted on atz degradation in o3 alone and o3 mn 4cn process which are presented in fig 7 a tba is a strong scavenger for free oh but only has a reaction rate constant of 3 10 3 m 1 s 1 with ozone the degradation efficiency of atz decreased obviously in the presence of tba to 35 and 37 on o3 mn 4cn and o3 alone respectively which revealed oh was the main ros interestingly addition of p bq and ffa more significantly inhibited the atz degradation which presented that both o2 and 1o2 may existed in the system of mn 4cn hco furthermore the reaction rates of p bq k oh p bq 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 and ffa k oh ffa 1 5 1010 m 1 s 1 with oh are higher than tba guo et al 2022 besides the reaction rates of p bq k ozone p bq 2 5 103 m 1 s 1 and ffa k ozone ffa 1 6 103 m 1 s 1 with ozone are much higher than tba guo et al 2022 hence it could be assumed that ozone would be activated to produce ros such as oh at ph 7 solution but degradation of atz was rapidly inhibited by the addition of enough p bq or ffa the concentration of quencher is more than 100 times greater than the concentration of atz due to the rapid depletion of oh ozone and other ros by p bq or ffa electron paramagnetic resonance epr was utilized to further detected the generated ros for hco over atz degradation in this study 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrolin n oxide dmpo is used as a trapping agent for oh and o2 while 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp is used as a trapping agent for 1o2 consequently the characteristic spectra of the dmpo oh fig 7 b adducts with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 was observed in both o3 alone and o3 mn 4cn system xiao et al 2017 zhou et al 2022 furthermore the characteristic spectra of the temp 1o2 fig 7 c adducts with an intensity ratio of 1 1 1 was observed in both o3 alone and o3 mn 4cn system xu et al 2020 in addition the intensity of the dmpo oh and temp 1o2 were both increased significantly by the addition of mn 4cn catalyst and exhibited more oh and 1o2 produced in the mn 4cn hco however the signal intensity of dmpo o2 fig 7 d was the same with or without addition of mn 4cn catalyst and exhibited no more o2 produced in the mn 4cn hco song et al 2019b the intermediate ros on the surfaces of the catalysts during the hco process were examined by in situ raman spectroscopy fig 5 d in the presence of o3 two new peaks appeared for both the p mno o3 and mn 4cn o3 systems the peaks at 881 and 980 cm 1 could be assigned to adsorbed peroxide o2 and adsorbed atomic oxygen o respectively bing et al 2015 cheng et al 2023 these results suggested that o3 was adsorbed at mn sites directly at mn sites or indirectly at surface hydroxyl groups and was decomposed in situ into surface o2 and o the surface o2 and o then generated o2 and oh as has been corroborated by radical quenching experiments and epr tests in addition 1o2 acts as a mild and selective oxidizing species so that it hardly contributes to degrade the atz the rate constants for the reaction of atz with 1o2 k 1o2 atz 4 104 m 1 s 1 marchetti et al 2013 thus oh was the dominant ros during mn 4cn hco the rate constants for the reaction of atz with oh k oh atz 3 109 m 1 s 1 3 5 effect of water matrices 3 5 1 effect of catalysts dosage the effects of catalyst dosage initial ozone concentration solution ph and experimental ambient temperature for hco of mn 4cn were systematically evaluated the effects of mn 4cn dosage on the degradation of atz were investigated in fig 8 a the degradation efficiency of atz reached 85 4 and 86 5 in 20 min when the dosage of mn 4cn was 0 01 g l 1 and 0 02 g l 1 respectively moreover the degradation efficiency of atz reached almost 98 0 when the dosage of mn 4cn was increased to 0 03 g l 1 on further increasing the mn 4cn dosage to 0 04 g l 1 and 0 05 g l 1 the degradation efficiency of atz did not improve significantly typically increasing the catalyst dosage provides more surface active sites for o3 decomposition and ros generation however because the concentration of o3 was fixed in the solution an excessive amount of catalyst would lead to excess formation of ros instantaneously excess ros would react with o3 itself or atz intermediates severely impairing its likelihood of reacting with atz chen et al 2021 hence an mn 4cn dosage of 0 03 g l 1 was identified as optimal at an initial o3 concentration of 3 mg l 1 in the hco process excess catalyst dosage would not only increase the operating cost but also negatively affect the degradation efficiency 3 5 2 effect of ozone dosage the effect of ozone dosage to atz degradation by o3 alone and o3 mn 4cn is shown in fig 8 b when the dosage of ozone was 1 mg l 1 the degradation efficiency of atz was 18 3 at 20 min by o3 alone while the degradation efficiency of atz was 90 7 at 5 min by o3 mn 4cn further increases ozone dosage up to 3 mg l 1 and 5 mg l 1 obviously enhanced the atz degradation efficiency by o3 alone but had a negligible effect by o3 mn 4cn thus 3 mg l 1 ozone is a sufficiently high dosage for atz degradation in our system 3 5 3 effect of solution ph the degradation efficiencies of atz by o3 alone and o3 mn 4cn under various initial ph conditions ranging from 3 0 to 9 0 are illustrated in fig 8 c the presence of mn 4cn greatly promoted the degradation of atz at ph 3 0 to 9 0 similar to o3 mn 4cn degradation efficiency of atz by o3 alone is also in positive relation with the solution ph the point of zero charge phpzc of mn 4cn was determined to be 2 25 which was lower than all of the initial ph in general the catalyst surface gets protonated or deprotonated when the phpzc is above or below the solution ph hence the mn 4cn surface was most negatively charged which was beneficial to the adsorption of ozone in accordance with the results about the increasing degradation efficiency of atz by hco with the ph increase the more electrons ozone gained the more o3 was produced and further evolved into oh as shown in eqs 15 20 song et al 2021 meanwhile the phpzc of mn 4cn also influenced the atz pka 1 6 adsorption on the surface wang et al 2019a the negligible adsorption of atz on mn 4cn was caused by electrostatic repelling forces between the deprotonated mn 4cn and the negatively charged atz is in line with the adsorption experiment results 15 o 3 e o 3 16 o 3 h ho 3 17 ho 3 oh o 2 18 o 3 o h ho 4 19 ho 4 ho 2 o 2 20 ho 2 o 3 oh 2 o 2 3 5 4 effect of temperature the degradation of atz at different reaction temperatures by ozonation with and without the application of mn 4cn is presented in fig 8 d the degradation efficiency of atz was increased from 40 7 to 75 4 within 20 min in the absence of mn 4cn by raising the temperature from 283 k to 298 k while the degradation efficiency of atz increased to more than 98 6 within 5 min with the presence of mn 4cn when the temperature was raised to 298 k the degradation efficiency of atz at 283 k and 288 k was almost the same and the degradation efficiency of atz at 298 k was slightly higher therefore mn 4cn as a catalyst of hco had a wide range of reaction temperature adaptation 3 5 5 effect of carbonate inorganic anions such as bicarbonate hco3 eq 21 and carbonate co3 2 eq 22 were also employed as scavengers of oh at rate constants of 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 and 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 respectively eqs 23 and 24 ma et al 2005 tan et al 2013 in the presence of carbonate fig 8 e the atz degradation in the o3 alone processes was not affected by the introduction of carbonate while the degradation efficiency of atz greatly decreased to 48 8 1 mm na2co3 and 37 1 10 mm na2co3 in 20 min at ph 7 in o3 mn 4cn processes which was most likely as a result of the negative effects of the formation of carbonate or bicarbonate free radicals 21 h 2 c o 3 aq h hco 3 22 hco 3 h co 3 2 23 oh hco 3 co 3 h 2 o 24 oh co 3 2 co 3 o h 3 5 6 effect of nom there is much natural organic matter nom in natural waters and the different concentration of nom always affects the degradation of organic pollutants we used the model nom suwanee river natural organic matter srnom to see the effect of nom in o3 alone and o3 mn 4cn system on degradation of atz as can be seen from fig 8 f the addition of nom improved the degradation efficiency of atz by o3 alone however increasing the nom concentration from 1 mgc l 1 to 5 mgc l 1 reduced the atz degradation efficiency during the o3 alone process only from 69 9 to 55 7 in 20 min moreover only nom low concentration 1 mgc l 1 promoted the degradation of atz in the o3 mn 4cn system whereas increasing the concentration of nom up to 1 mgc l 1 accelerated the degradation efficiency of atz during o3 mn 4cn system up to 100 subsequently further increasing the concentration up to 5 mgc l 1 the degradation efficiency of atz in o3 mn 4cn system slowed down to 60 7 since the nom contains numerous functional groups that can act as radical initiators to react with ozone to generate ros and act as radical scavengers to compete with atz to react with ros such as oh 3 5 7 effect of real wastewater matrix the performance of the mn 4cn o3 system for atz degradation in real wastewater hfww was evaluated as shown in fig s19 the atz degradation rate was enhanced in hfww in both the uncatalyzed and catalyzed ozonation systems a considerable increase in the atz degradation extent was observed in hfww 62 compared to that in upw 41 for sole ozonation after 20 min which can be mainly attributed to the presence of dissolved organic matter dom oh et al 2017 the dom in the ozonation system acts as an initiator for the chain reaction of ozonation thus accelerating o3 decomposition and ros generation ding et al 2020 on the contrary the change in atz degradation rate after 1 min of reaction was negligible for the mn 4cn o3 system when upw 87 was replaced by hfww 95 proving the robust hco capacity of mn 4cn some researchers have reported similar results to those obtained here while some others have reported an inhibition of atz degradation in real wastewater guo et al 2018 petre et al 2013 yang et al 2022 this may be attributed to the effects of complex water matrices including doc concentration and types ph anions e g cl alkalinity and o3 and catalyst dosages therefore the reaction conditions of hco systems should be appropriately controlled in order to ensure the removal efficiency of refractory pollutants in real applications in general the mn 4cn hco is more resistant to the negative effect of water matrices on the degradation of atz when compared to sole ozonation the hco process of a low mn 4cn 0 03 g l 1 concentration can effectively degrade refractory organic pollutants despite the low temperature and low ozone dosage these findings demonstrate that mn 4cn is widely applicable for the hco process in various water matrices 3 6 acute toxicity of intermediates the acute toxicity assessments were carried out to compare o3 alone and o3 mn 4cn processes according to the relative luminescence intensity rli of luminescent bacteria i e vibrio qinghaiensis sp q67 in the sole ozonation process shown in fig 9 the luminescence intensity of the initial solution was 100 then the luminescence intensity did not decrease after 1 h reaction time while it decreased to 69 5 after 3 h reaction time this was because the selective oxidation of ozone with a redox potential of 2 07 ev was too hard to degrade atz and produce toxic by product in a short period of time in the o3 mn 4cn process for atz degradation the luminescence intensity sharply decreased after 1 h reaction 3 0 due to a large number of highly toxic intermediate products generated after the degradation of atz by oh whose redox potential is 2 70 ev meng et al 2022 subsequently the toxicity of the generated deeply oxidized intermediates was weakened and the luminescence intensity reached 99 4 after 3 h and reached 100 after 9 h 3 7 intermediates identification the formed atz products generated in the hco process were detected and identified based on mass spectra of ms and ms ms analyses seven products were identified and three possible transformation pathways were proposed table s6 and fig 10 in pathway ⅰ the dealkylation process initiate the degradation of atz the intermediates ceat cait and caat were formed by the attack of alkyl groups from both the atz lateral chain by ozone or oh which were further transformed into oaat through the de chlorination hydroxylation process in pathway ii atz was degraded directly through a de chlorination hydroxylation process yielding oeit which was then de alkylated to yield oait and oaat finally in pathway iii the degradation involved the alkylic hydroxylation process cnit was formed by the replacement of a side chain hydrogen atom of atz with a hydroxyl group 3 8 enhanced mn cn hco mechanism according to the front discussion the possible reaction mechanism of mn 4cn hco is illustrated in fig 11 since the surface adsorption of atz on mn 4cn is not the main way to removal atz the high degradation efficiency of atz is attributed to the decomposition of ozone on the surface of the mn 4cn to generate ros as the electron rich mn ii center and mn 4cn surface hydroxyl group were the catalytic active sites the generated oh was the main ros and o2 as well as 1o2 were also generated during the radical chain reaction of the hco the electron rich mn ii center acted as the catalytic active sites to transfer electrons to ozone and then furtherly generate oh to attack atz followed by the formation of surface mn iii meanwhile the reduction of mn iii to mn ii occurred by obtaining electrons not only from the cn through c n mn and c o mn bonds but also through the ozone decomposition chain reaction in addition the surface hydroxyl groups formed by chemisorbed water molecules on the mn sites can adsorb ozone and generate oh to attack atz 4 conclusion the mno dispersed on cn mn ncn was successfully fabricated via a facile calcination process by using mno2 and 2 6 dap as precursors compared with sole mno and cn activity in hco processes respectively the synergistic effects between mno and cn in mn ncn achieved significantly refractory organic pollutant degradation electron rich mn ii centers and electron poor cn sites are considered as the main active sites created by the formation of c n mn and c o mn bonds various ros including oh 1o2 as well as o2 were generated during the hco processes and oh mainly drive the atz degradation mn ncn exhibited robust activity over a wide ph range temperature carbonate and nom concentration the catalytic activity of mn ncn remained almost constant after four consecutive cycles and the leaching of mn ions was insignificant mn ncn was an effective and promising catalyst which was suitable
