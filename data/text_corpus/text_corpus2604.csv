essential components of life air water and land 1 environmental pollution is becoming a global problem in which water pollution is a critical issue as water is used for different purposes 2 disposal of wastes from industries in the environment such as metallurgy and metal finishing textiles and ceramics and leather tanning causes various environmental problems tanneries are one of the most developed economic sectors in many developing countries unfortunately these are considered as one of the main consumers of water and thusly the most environmental pollution generator due to the discharge of a huge volume of potentially dangerous and toxic wastewater which creates a negative impact and reflection of a tannery in the world 3 4 tanning is the treatment of hides and skins to preserve and convert them into a stable material leather which will not putrefy and is suitable for a wide variety of applications 5 in the leather tannery industry animal hides have gone through complex stages to be transformed into leather consuming large amounts of water and chemicals such as lime sodium sulphide sulphate of ammonia sodium chloride and chromium salts 6 more than 90 of the leather produced in the world is tanned with chemicals containing chromium such as chromium salts which cannot be utilized by skin tissue and the excess will be discharged into the effluent 7 heavy metals containing industrial effluents cause health risks to humans plants animals and aquatic life causing problems for flora and fauna which contaminates the natural environment 5 8 the high concentration of heavy metals present in the environment is the main problem of the ecosystem due to their non degrading persistent nature and their bioaccumulation heavy metals affect soil microorganisms this leads to the loss of bacterial species responsible for nutrient cycling causing a negative consequence on the ecosystem functioning 9 many researches affirm the high tannery effluent toxicity which is mainly characterized by high salinity and organic load and specific pollutants such as sulphide and chromium 4 the leather industry is one of the most polluting industries on the planet as far as the volume and complexity of effluent discharges rich in chromium cr the transformation of the rawhide into the final leather product involves several processing steps consuming an enormous amount of water at each one 5 tannery effluent is highly polluted because it contains high organic and inorganic loads salinity strong color dissolved and suspended solids a high load of potentially toxic elements with specific pollutants such as chromium 10 among the metal ions generally present in the effluents of tanneries mention may be made of chromium aluminium and zirconium these latter are all classified as having a high moderately acute or chronic toxic effect on organic life with a high bioaccumulation rate 11 in the tanning process chromium is applied to obtain desirable quality leather and is considered a highly toxic heavy metal cr vi which causes water pollution 12 chromium generally exists in two different forms trivalent cr iii and hexavalent cr vi form trivalent cr is considered non toxic and relatively immobile in nature while hexavalent cr is mobile highly soluble in water and highly toxic with potential carcinogenic mutagenic as well as teratogenic effects in nature and has been listed as a class a human carcinogen by the us epa 13 effluents containing cr are found in the environment of disposal sites where cr undergoes oxidation reactions and forms cr vi 14 in addition the difference in toxic nature of the two forms of cr the release of cr vi to surface waters is regulated to under than 0 05 mg l by the us epa while total cr including cr iii cr vi and its other forms is regulated to under than 2 mg l 15 several human diseases and disorders including vomiting skin allergy diarrhea dermatitis gastrointestinal bleeding birth defects lung cancer brain damage and premature death are associated with exposure to cr vi 13 chrome cr vi has also been reported to affect some metabolic processes in plants leading to poor seed germination stunted root growth chlorosis photosynthetic impairing and the death of plants 13 lead and cadmium are defined as environmental pollutants and generate serious effects for human and animal health because they are easily transferred in food chains and are not known to perform an essential biological role 16 wu and wang investigated the toxicological effects of cadmium in adductor muscles and digestive gland tissues as well as changes in soft tissue metabolic profiles in response to copper and cadmium 17 dna damage that occurs when metal ions interact with dna and nuclear proteins resulting in cell cycle modulation apoptosis or carcinogenesis 18 in addition pb zn cu cd fe mn and al have significant impacts on natural ecosystems when released from residues at levels toxic to plants 19 the aims of the present work were i to investigate the physicochemical analysis and bacteriological assessment of the industrial effluents from the southern tunisian tannery estt and ii to

germs like yersinia enterolitica listeria staphylococci were explored 27 suspected colony of the cultivable microflora that differed in size color and shape was picked up and sub cultured on different selective media finally this colony was identified based on cultural morphological and biochemical characteristics to obtain pure isolates and then preserved on different plates for further studies

japan the five samples of the treated and untreated effluents are intended for spectral scanning 200 to 800 nm 32 2 4 2 ft ir analysis to obtain the absorption spectra of the tannery wastewater samples and find out the functional group of organic chemicals the estt samples were oven dried at 105 c and the resulting pellets were mixed with kbr in a ratio of 1 30 in addition the absorbance spectra were recorded by a nicolet ft ir spectrometer nicolet model 6700 thermo fisher scientific usa the analysis was performed in the mid infrared range of 4000 to 400 cm 1 a sweep was performed to obtain the spectrum and measured in ambient air against pure kbr as a background spectrum 3 2 5 micro toxicity tests the micro toxicity was studied using bacillus subtilis and escherichia coli strains

concentrations of 25 50 75 and 100 in the nb the bacterial growth was assessed by optical density od at 600 nm recorded at 2 h intervals for 10 h 2 6 statistical analysis all the results were the average of three replicates of two separate experiments they were statistically analyzed by sas software version 8 using duncan test performed after analysis of variance anova 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization of industrial effluents from the southern tunisian tannery the first part of the experimental survey involved the characterization of the industrial effluent in terms of conventional parameters the main physico chemical characteristics of estt are shown in table 1 the results indicated that the estt effluents were relatively alkaline for the five basins 7 0 13 6 and highly saline in the influent and neutral in the effluent ec 85 1 4 88 ms cm in fact alkalinity is defined as the ability of a water body to neutralize acids and bases and thus maintain a fairly stable ph level 33 it refers to the amount of h needed to consume the carbonates present in the water such alkalinity is due to the liming step in which hair and flesh are removed through the use of lime and sodium sulphide 4 the high conductivity values indicate that salts 2 52 58 g l are present at high levels in these effluents 4 this salinity was related to the richness of estts in chlorides 372 736 920mg l the estt basin 1 characterized by objectionable offensive and unpleasant odor might be due to the presence of sulphides in the tannery untreated effluent the putrefaction of the organic residues from the processed skin and hides as well as chromium used in finishing leather which induces its dark blue color fig 1b this color might be due to the presence of biodegradable and high molecular weight organic compounds and high amount of inorganic chemicals like sodium and chromium used during the processing 5 this later blocks the penetration of sunlight into the receiving bodies of water subsequently decreases photosynthetic activity the dissolved oxygen content negatively affecting aquatic life 3 the mean tss values of composite tannery effluents at different basins ranged from 1 24 0 07 to 12 30 2 64 g l resulting in an elevated value of their turbidity 46 752436 ntu in fact the value at estt basin 1 was higher than those at monitoring points estt basin 2 estt basin 3 estt basin 4 and estt basin 5 which resulted in a high value of their turbidity for estt basin 1 2436 00 208 ntu and for estt basin 4 524 5 ntu the values were above the standard limits for effluent discharge set by hydraulic public domain dph 34 and with international standards 35 the settled suspended particles on the soil can disturb soil fauna and lead to various changes in porosity soil texture and water holding capacity 36 literature classified wastewater tss as follows tss less than 100 mg l as weak tss greater than 100 mg l but less than 220 mg l as medium and tss greater than 220 mg l as strong wastewater results of this study show that estt wastewaters can be classified as strong wastewater and cannot be discharged into stream 37 in addition a total organic carbon high value an important parameter which indicated the high organic pollution of the water toc 44 3 21 g l was noticed in estt basin 3 the present results are in concordance of those reported by sugasini and rajagopal 38 tds is a measure of the total of inorganic salts and other substances dissolved in water in the present experiment the tds was found to be much higher than the limit of dph 2 10 g l for estt basin 1 44 20 3 46 g l and estt basin 3 63 2 3 15 g l higher tds values are due to the presence of dissolved organic matter and inorganic impurities sugasini and rajagopal 38 have also reported similar results of the tds increase total dissolved solids in the effluent samples could be mainly due to presence of bicarbonates carbonates chlorides sulphates phosphates nitrates nitrogen calcium sodium potassium and iron in the chemicals used in the processing of the hides and skin the found results agree with those reported by mohammed et al 5 besides the degree of water pollution was generally assessed by the determination of the two key parameters cod and bod5 moreover samples contain high cod values 14 065 29 155 868 42 21 03 8826 99 98 1062 56 18 63 and 91 42 8 24 mg l for estt basin 1 estt basin 2 estt basin 3 estt basin 4 and estt basin 5 respectively besides these a high bod5 concentration is found for estt basin 1 with 3100 100 mg l hence the value of the estt cod bod5 ratio is superior to the border three basin 1 basin 3 and basin 4 underlining an organic load that is poorly biodegradable the reported dbo5 dco provides important indications on the origin of the employed water pollutions and the proper treatment to be accomplished 39 it was noticed that the cod bod5 and tss were all exceeding the previously reported ranges for industrial wastewaters the tss dbo5 ratio explains that the material in suspension unsettles the oxygenation and bacterial activity many researchers reported similar results 39 hence the biodegradability ratio bod5 cod ratio was 1 03 in estt basin 5 suggesting that a considerable part of the organic matter in the effluent is biodegradable which reflects that these effluents were potentially biodegradable and therefore a biological treatment for such wastewaters is feasible 40 it should be noted that bod seems to be a very bad parameter for tannery effluents because it can reflect only a weak organic fraction and is very sensitive to the powerful inhibitors which are present in these effluents 41 finally the higher dissolved oxygen values of the effluent were measured as 11 10 0 98 mg l for esst basin 5 the results reveal that the effluents estt contained very high concentration of sulphate the latter was due to the large amount of sodium sulphide salts used in the southern tunisian tannery high sulphate concentrations in tannery effluents can also result from many auxiliary chemicals used in industries during tanning processes 36 additionally estt basin 2 was characterized by high contents of total kjeldahl nitrogen reaching 18 40 0 5 g l compared to the estt basin 4 5 0 1 g l these values exceeded the values suggested by tunisian standards for discharge dph the amount and composition of total nitrogen in tannery effluent depends on the type of leather processed the amount of chemicals and water consumption used during processing and other factors such as duration of the process 42 all the values for various physicochemical parameters obtained in this study were found higher than the recommended permissible values for dph 34 and international standards 35 table 1 3 2 microbiological characterization of industrial effluents from the southern tunisian tannery the microbiological analyses of the estt basins table 3 showed the presence of the fecal streptococci fungi the total coliforms and fecal coliforms in all basins these coliforms indicate fecal contamination in the previous study where it was carried out to confirm the presence or absence of coliform bacteria in samples of industrial effluents 12 therefore the presence of staphylococcus was noticed only in basin 4 and basin 5 listeria and anaerobic sulphite reducing as r were present also in all basins except basin 3 pseudomonas and yersinia enterolitica ye were detected in basins 1 4 and 5 fortunately salmonella cholera vibrio cv and helminth egg he were absent in all basins additionally estt basin 2 and estt basin 3 have enormous amounts of chemicals and chromium 3662 mg l involved in the tanning process they are characterized by their heavy metal content high salinity turbidity and alkaline ph which translate to the total absence of staphylococcus pseudomonas yersinia and as r and with a low load in for other microflora search bacillus sp and pseudomonas sp were the predominant bacteria can be isolated and identified in such effluents could be as a result of their ability to survive and resist chromium and other heavy metals present in the tannery effluent 5 some colony of the cultivable microflora that differed in size color and shape was picked up and sub cultured on different selective media and was finally identified all isolates s1 s2 s3 s4 s6 s7 s8 and s9 from estt were characterized on the basis of morphological cultural and biochemical characteristics table 4 all the isolates were found to be gram negative oxidase positive tryptophane deaminase tda and acetoin production vp except strain s3 s6 and s9 the tested strains were catalase positive s1 s3 s4 and s6 isolates were mobile while s2 s7 s8 and s9 strains were immobile the biochemical tests were negative for arginine dihydrolase adh lysine decarboxilase lcd ornithine decarboxilase odc h2s production urease ure indole production ind manitol fermentation oxidation man inositol fermentation oxidation ino sorbitol fermentation oxidation sor rhamnose fermentation oxidation rha melibiose fermentation oxidation mel and arabinose fermentation oxidation ara the analytical profile index strain identification was done the eight strains were identified using morphological characteristics biochemical results and the carbohydrates utilization the identification leads to two main species burkholderia and brucella the presence of brucella spp was expected since its presence in wastewater treatment plants was demonstrated 43 biological reduction of cr vi to relatively less toxic cr iii by living and inactivated microbial biomass is considered one of the most practical and useful methods for reducing cr vi toxicity 13 a number of bacterial strains have been reported to possess cr vi reduction potential e g intrasporangium sp bacillus sp arthrobacter sp escherichia coli shewanella sp serratia marcescens vogococcus fluvialis arthrobacter aurescens burkholderia cepacia microbacterium sp pseudomonas sp pseudomonas ambigua and staphylococcus aureus and pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from tannery effluents 13 in addition the bacterial strains belonging to this genus brucella have already been reported for their potential of bioremediating a number of pollutants including chromate 13 3 3 metal ions and ions analyses five effluents from a tunisian tannery were used in this study estt basin 1 estt basin 2 estt basin 3 estt basin 4 and estt basin 5 the data represented in table 2 showed higher values of metal ions and ions in this effluent the effluent was found to have lead chloride potassium chromium cadmium nickel sodium mercury and manganese concentrations much higher than regulatory limits set by dph 34 and international standards 35 the concentration of chloride sodium and chromium in the effluent was at highest levels consequently the high sodium content resulted in the high salinity of these effluents the use of chromium during the tanning process allows revealing a high value especially at basin 3 for collecting effluents loaded with chromium 3662 mg l exceeding tunisian standards for discharges 0 05 mg l the estt basin 3 had higher load of calcium and sodium of around 905 73 mg l and 42 240 mg l respectively that reflects the higher salinity and subsequently the turbidity of estt in which the decreasing trend of metal and anions was na cl cr ca mn mg k al zn fe pb ni cd hg iron concentration was not generally exceeding the guideline limit by dph 34 although iron is one of the essential elements of the human diet its presence in high concentrations in ecosystems causes major pollution and human health problems such as vomiting cardiovascular collapse and diarrhea while iron deficiency can lead to anti clotting of the blood to replenish itself 44 in general the trend of metal and anion availability in estt basin 1 sample was na cl ca mg k mn cr pb fe ni cd zn al hg the metal ion and concentrations change from basin to basin this difference in concentrations was due to chemicals used during tanning process this process produces multi component wastewaters which usually cause difficulties and inhibitory behaviours in treatment processes 45 for estt basin 2 the trend of metal was na cl k mn hg ca pb ni al cd cr zn hg in addition the concentrations of metal ions and ions in the estt basin 4 were as follow na cl mn ca mg k ni cd cr fe pb hg therefore it is concluded that the leather industrial effluent was highly polluted and not suitable for irrigation or any other uses besides the estt basin 5 contained more metal ions and ions but are less than the standards and its trend was cl ca mg na mn k ni cd fe cr zn hg the results showed the richness of estt in ions which their content exceeded required limits 34 akan et al 44 stated that the mean concentrations of metals in tannery effluents were high compared to standard limits the accumulation of toxic metal ions in the soils receiving tannery industries effluents as well as their phytotoxicity were equally demonstrated 11 finally different estts were devoid copper sulphur selenium tin and arsenic the heavy metal ions rejected by the leather industries and other industries such as the phosphate laundries in the south west of tunisia pose a threat to the human population the marine biodiversity as well as the agricultural environment effective remediation has yet to be taken care of 12 since metal ions are not biodegradable a real threat to the environment and hence persist in the environment for centuries 46 3 4 spectral characterization of industrial effluents from the southern tunisian tannery the spectral characterization of these effluents fig 2 a b c d e from the five basins shows the presence of major absorbance peaks in the uv range at 215 and 275 nm for basin 1 fig 2a 230 nm for basin 2 fig 2b 230 265 285 425 and 580 nm for basin 3 fig 2c and 285 nm for basin 4 fig 2d and basin 5 fig 2e these peaks can be attributed to the phenolic compounds associated with the heavy metals present namely manganese 275 nm lead and magnesium 285 nm iron 250 nm zinc 215 nm and nickel and cadmium 230 nm in addition following the chemical reactions of the various agents used during tanning the formation of sodium oxide na2o and calcium oxide cao which absorb around 250 nm was observed the 280 nm band can be attributed to proteins this result can be explained by the denaturation of proteins due to the basic ph and the high content of heavy metals cr pb fe and ni in addition the major peak at 580 nm at basin 3 can be attributed to the sodium presence the spectral analysis confirmed the presence of metals ions mentioned in table 2 the infrared spectra fig 2a b c d e obtained for the different samples show similar curves an absorption band around 3320 cm 1 reflects the stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups oh 47 a strong adsorption band was observed for sample basin 1 fig 2a and the weakest one is observed in sample basin 2 fig 2b this means the disappearance of hydroxyl compounds during treatment process the absorption bands around 2900 and 2850 cm 1 have been attributed to asymmetric vibrations of aromatic ch and methoxyl groups och3 47 48 these bands appear only on the spectrum of sample basin 1 fig 2a which justifies the elimination of organic matter during the tanning process the presence of organic matter is also verified by the presence of strong absorption bands around 1605 and 1450 cm 1 particularly in basin 1 fig 2a and basin 3 fig 2c samples in fact these adsorption bands translate vibrations corresponding in particular to the cc bonds of the aromatic rings 49 present in the wastewater the appearance of a peak in the spectra of basin 1 basin 2 and basin 3 fig 2a b and c respectively samples around 940 cm 1 related to the presence of aluminum 50 52 which is in agreement with the results of table 2 the intense band at 1030 cm 1 corresponds to the phosphates 53 54 low intensity thin bands around 695 cm 1 and strong bands around 870 and 1415 cm 1 were attributed to carbonates reflecting the presence of calcium and calcium oxide 55 table 2 3 5 toxicity studies the relative sensitivity of the bacterial strains e coli and b subtilis towards the estt from different basins 1 2 3 4 and 5 was studied micro toxicity assay was done on the nutrient broth medium as control and on nutrient broth medium supplemented with raw and diluted effluent from the five basins the results of this monitoring are presented in fig 3 the micro toxicity study showed that the untreated effluents basin 1 basin 2 and basin 3 totally inhibited the growth of e coli and b subtilis as was expected raw estt wastewaters from basin 1 2 and 3 were very toxic due the high amounts of metal ions cr mn fe ni cd pb al and zn as showed in table 2 in fact effluent from basin 1 was highly toxic at 50 for bacillus subtilis fig 3a and for e coli fig 3a in addition 25 raw wastewater from basin 2 inhibited 22 and 80 the growth of b subtilis fig 3b and e coli fig 3b respectively not surprising effluent from basin 3 was very toxic at 25 with a percentage of inhibition growth equal to 98 for the two used strains there is no growth for both e coli and b subtilis due to the high amount of cr exceeding 3662 mg l fig 3c and c however the growth curves of the two bacterial strains on the media supplemented with the effluents from basins 4 and 5 exhibited a decrease in the inhibition levels moreover basin 4 raw effluents 25 were less toxic since the bacterial growth of e coli and b subtilis was inhibited up to 60 and 50 this inhibition was accentuated at 100 of raw basin 4 basin effluent and was 66 73 for the two bacteria fig 3d and d at 100 of basin 5 raw effluent basin the percentage of growth inhibition was decreased to 55 for b subtilis and 65 for e coli these results suggested that consortium treatment led to an important decrease of the toxicity and could be consequently efficient for tannery wastewater treatment with improvement of the physico chemical parameters in fact as mentioned in fig 3 growth kinetics indicated different slopes the growth of bacterial strains decelerates when high levels of raw effluents basin 1 basin 2 and basin 3 were added to the medium even with a four time diluted effluent a considerable inhibition of both e coli and b subtilis growth was obtained this growth was explained by the dilution of the major metal ions such as cr fe ni cd pb al and zn as well as the ions na ca and cl however after bacterial treatment assays growth patterns of the bacterial strains were similar to the growth patterns on nb medium especially with 25 of treated effluents the best results of this monitoring were obtained for b subtilis strain besides these results demonstrate that e coli seems to be more sensitive than b subtilis indeed the difference in sensitivity was evident since e coli was gram and b subtilis was gram for all basins e coli was more inhibited for all basins than b subtilis as mentioned in fig 3 a overall the ability of the used consortium to reduce organic and mineral pollution as well as the toxicity of tannery effluents under non optimised conditions was confirmed and could be a good alternative for improvement of this treatment after several optimizations for industrial bioreactor scale besides the tannery effluent treatment plants commonly use the coagulation flocculation which is relatively a much expensive method that produces sludge with high level of chemicals thus this biological process could be an eco friendly and an economic alternative to solve the excessive use of chemicals since chromium could be regenerated and reused 4 4 conclusion and future prospective the physico chemical microbiological and spectral characterizations of the estt five basins were done as well as the toxicity evaluation the results concluded that biological treatment caused significant reductions in pollutant load in the tannery effluent being discharge from the tannery the results showed that the untreated effluents were alkaline very saline rich in potentially toxic metals having a high microflora content and a bod5 cod ratio favorable to possible biodegradability however the reduction of pollutants such as tds bod cod and tss was more effective after the bacteria action basin 4 and 5 in addition almost the metal ions and ions concentration was reduced the micro toxicity study showed that the untreated effluents basin 1 basin 2 and basin 3 totally inhibited the growth of e coli and b subtilis in addition basin 3 having the high amount of cr 3662 mg l was very toxic with 98 of growth inhibition for the two used strains raw effluent basin 4 and 5 having a decreased growth inhibition percentage for b subtilis and e coli disposal of this tannery wastewater type is not safe to discharge without proper treatment as it alters the physicochemical properties of the water creating a harmful effect on the ecosystem and the people residing in the tannery industrial area are at high risk of diseases since the experimental conditions have been achieved it can be interpreted that the effluent is highly toxic and can also act as a major pollutant of water and soil in the respective area greatly affecting environment friendly microorganisms plants and human beings however there is a need to improve the used consortium treating the estt effluent as well as the optimization of the various biotic and abiotic parameters which are the objective of our next study furthermore this works suggests that immobilized cell methods of bacterial treatment can be used in tannery effluent treatment to reduce pollution

complex stages to be transformed into leather consuming large amounts of water and chemicals such as lime sodium sulphide sulphate of ammonia sodium chloride and chromium salts 6 more than 90 of the leather produced in the world is tanned with chemicals containing chromium such as chromium salts which cannot be utilized by skin tissue and the excess will be discharged into the effluent 7 heavy metals containing industrial effluents cause health risks to humans plants animals and aquatic life causing problems for flora and fauna which contaminates the natural environment 5 8 the high concentration of heavy metals present in the environment is the main problem of the ecosystem due to their non degrading persistent nature and their bioaccumulation heavy metals affect soil microorganisms this leads to the loss of bacterial species responsible for nutrient cycling causing a negative consequence on the ecosystem functioning 9 many researches affirm the high tannery effluent toxicity which is mainly characterized by high salinity and organic load and specific pollutants such as sulphide and chromium 4 the leather industry is one of the most polluting industries on the planet as far as the volume and complexity of effluent discharges rich in chromium cr the transformation of the rawhide into the final leather product involves several processing steps consuming an enormous amount of water at each one 5 tannery effluent is highly polluted because it contains high organic and inorganic loads salinity strong color dissolved and suspended solids a high load of potentially toxic elements with specific pollutants such as chromium 10 among the metal ions generally present in the effluents of tanneries mention may be made of chromium aluminium and zirconium these latter are all classified as having a high moderately acute or chronic toxic effect on organic life with a high bioaccumulation rate 11 in the tanning process chromium is applied to obtain desirable quality leather and is considered a highly toxic heavy metal cr vi which causes water pollution 12 chromium generally exists in two different forms trivalent cr iii and hexavalent cr vi form trivalent cr is considered non toxic and relatively immobile in nature while hexavalent cr is mobile highly soluble in water and highly toxic with potential carcinogenic mutagenic as well as teratogenic effects in nature and has been listed as a class a human carcinogen by the us epa 13 effluents containing cr are found in the environment of disposal sites where cr undergoes oxidation reactions and forms cr vi 14 in addition the difference in toxic nature of the two forms of cr the release of cr vi to surface waters is regulated to under than 0 05 mg l by the us epa while total cr including cr iii cr vi and its other forms is regulated to under than 2 mg l 15 several human diseases and disorders including vomiting skin allergy diarrhea dermatitis gastrointestinal bleeding birth defects lung cancer brain damage and premature death are associated with exposure to cr vi 13 chrome cr vi has also been reported to affect some metabolic processes in plants leading to poor seed germination stunted root growth chlorosis photosynthetic impairing and the death of plants 13 lead and cadmium are defined as environmental pollutants and generate serious effects for human and animal health because they are easily transferred in food chains and are not known to perform an essential biological role 16 wu and wang investigated the toxicological effects of cadmium in adductor muscles and digestive gland tissues as well as changes in soft tissue metabolic profiles in response to copper and cadmium 17 dna damage that occurs when metal ions interact with dna and nuclear proteins resulting in cell cycle modulation apoptosis or carcinogenesis 18 in addition pb zn cu cd fe mn and al have significant impacts on natural ecosystems when released from residues at levels toxic to plants 19 the aims of the present work were i to investigate the physicochemical analysis and bacteriological assessment of the industrial effluents from the southern tunisian tannery estt and ii to

japan the five samples of the treated and untreated effluents are intended for spectral scanning 200 to 800 nm 32 2 4 2 ft ir analysis to obtain the absorption spectra of the tannery wastewater samples and find out the functional group of organic chemicals the estt samples were oven dried at 105 c and the resulting pellets were mixed with kbr in a ratio of 1 30 in addition the absorbance spectra were recorded by a nicolet ft ir spectrometer nicolet model 6700 thermo fisher scientific usa the analysis was performed in the mid infrared range of 4000 to 400 cm 1 a sweep was performed to

average of three replicates of two separate experiments they were statistically analyzed by sas software version 8 using duncan test performed after analysis of variance anova 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization of industrial effluents from the southern tunisian tannery the first part of the experimental survey involved the characterization of the industrial effluent in terms of conventional parameters the main physico chemical characteristics of estt are shown in table 1 the results indicated that the estt effluents were relatively alkaline for the five basins 7 0 13 6 and highly saline in the influent and neutral in the effluent ec 85 1 4 88 ms cm in fact alkalinity is defined as the ability of a water body to neutralize acids and bases and thus maintain a fairly stable ph level 33 it refers to the amount of h needed to consume the carbonates present in the water such alkalinity is due to the liming step in which hair and flesh are removed through the use of lime and sodium sulphide 4 the high conductivity values indicate that salts 2 52 58 g l are present at high levels in these effluents 4 this salinity was related to the richness of estts in chlorides 372 736 920mg l the estt basin 1 characterized by objectionable offensive and unpleasant odor might be due to the presence of sulphides in the tannery untreated effluent the putrefaction of the organic residues from the processed skin and hides as well as chromium used in finishing leather which induces its dark blue color fig 1b this color might be due to the presence of biodegradable and high molecular weight organic compounds and high amount of inorganic chemicals like sodium and chromium used during the processing 5 this later blocks the penetration of sunlight into the receiving bodies of water subsequently decreases photosynthetic activity the dissolved oxygen content negatively affecting aquatic life 3 the mean tss values of composite tannery effluents at different basins ranged from 1 24 0 07 to 12 30 2 64 g l resulting in an elevated value of their turbidity 46 752436 ntu in fact the value at estt basin 1 was higher than those at monitoring points estt basin 2 estt basin 3 estt basin 4 and estt basin 5 which resulted in a high value of their turbidity for estt basin 1 2436 00 208 ntu and for estt basin 4 524 5 ntu the values were above the standard limits for effluent discharge set by hydraulic public domain dph 34 and with international standards 35 the settled suspended particles on the soil can disturb soil fauna and lead to various changes in porosity soil texture and water holding capacity 36 literature classified wastewater tss as follows tss less than 100 mg l as weak tss greater than 100 mg l but less than 220 mg l as medium and tss greater than 220 mg l as strong wastewater results of this study show that estt wastewaters can be classified as strong wastewater and cannot be discharged into stream 37 in addition a total organic carbon high value an important parameter which indicated the high organic pollution of the water toc 44 3 21 g l was noticed in estt basin 3 the present results are in concordance of those reported by sugasini and rajagopal 38 tds is a measure of the total of inorganic salts and other substances dissolved in water in the present experiment the tds was found to be much higher than the limit of dph 2 10 g l for estt basin 1 44 20 3 46 g l and estt basin 3 63 2 3 15 g l higher tds values are due to the presence of dissolved organic matter and inorganic impurities sugasini and rajagopal 38 have also reported similar results of the tds increase total dissolved solids in the effluent samples could be mainly due to presence of bicarbonates carbonates chlorides sulphates phosphates nitrates nitrogen calcium sodium potassium and iron in the chemicals used in the processing of the hides and skin the found results agree with those reported by mohammed et al 5 besides the degree of water pollution was generally assessed by the determination of the two key parameters cod and bod5 moreover samples contain high cod values 14 065 29 155 868 42 21 03 8826 99 98 1062 56 18 63 and 91 42 8 24 mg l for estt basin 1 estt basin 2 estt basin 3 estt basin 4 and estt basin 5 respectively besides these a high bod5 concentration is found for estt basin 1 with 3100 100 mg l hence the value of the estt cod bod5 ratio is superior to the border three basin 1 basin 3 and basin 4 underlining an organic load that is poorly biodegradable the reported dbo5 dco provides important indications on the origin of the employed water pollutions and the proper treatment to be accomplished 39 it was noticed that the cod bod5 and tss were all exceeding the previously reported ranges for industrial wastewaters the tss dbo5 ratio explains that the material in suspension unsettles the oxygenation and bacterial activity many researchers reported similar results 39 hence the biodegradability ratio bod5 cod ratio was 1 03 in estt basin 5 suggesting that a considerable part of the organic matter in the effluent is biodegradable which reflects that these effluents were potentially biodegradable and therefore a biological treatment for such wastewaters is feasible 40 it should be noted that bod seems to be a very bad parameter for tannery effluents because it can reflect only a weak organic fraction and is very sensitive to the powerful inhibitors which are present in these effluents 41 finally the higher dissolved oxygen values of the effluent were measured as 11 10 0 98 mg l for esst basin 5 the results reveal that the effluents estt contained very high concentration of sulphate the latter was due to the large amount of sodium sulphide salts used in the southern tunisian tannery high sulphate concentrations in tannery effluents can also result from many auxiliary chemicals used in industries during tanning processes 36 additionally estt basin 2 was characterized by high contents of total kjeldahl nitrogen reaching 18 40 0 5 g l compared to the estt basin 4 5 0 1 g l these values exceeded the values suggested by tunisian standards for discharge dph the amount and composition of total nitrogen in tannery effluent depends on the type of leather processed the amount of chemicals and water consumption used during processing and other factors such as duration of the process 42 all the values for various physicochemical parameters obtained in this study were found higher than the recommended permissible values for dph 34 and international standards 35 table 1 3 2 microbiological characterization of industrial effluents from the southern tunisian tannery the microbiological analyses of the estt basins table 3 showed the presence of the fecal streptococci fungi the total coliforms and fecal coliforms in all basins these coliforms indicate fecal contamination in the previous study where it was carried out to confirm the presence or absence of coliform bacteria in samples of industrial effluents 12 therefore the presence of staphylococcus was noticed only in basin 4 and basin 5 listeria and anaerobic sulphite reducing as r were present also in all basins except basin 3 pseudomonas and yersinia enterolitica ye were detected in basins 1 4 and 5 fortunately salmonella cholera vibrio cv and helminth egg he were absent in all basins additionally estt basin 2 and estt basin 3 have enormous amounts of chemicals and chromium 3662 mg l involved in the tanning process they are characterized by their heavy metal content high salinity turbidity and alkaline ph which translate to the total absence of staphylococcus pseudomonas yersinia and as r and with a low load in for other microflora search bacillus sp and pseudomonas sp were the predominant bacteria can be isolated and identified in such effluents could be as a result of their ability to survive and resist chromium and other heavy metals present in the tannery effluent 5 some colony of the cultivable microflora that differed in size color and shape was picked up and sub cultured on different selective media and was finally identified all isolates s1 s2 s3 s4 s6 s7 s8 and s9 from estt were characterized on the basis of morphological cultural and biochemical characteristics table 4 all the isolates were found to be gram negative oxidase positive tryptophane deaminase tda and acetoin production vp except strain s3 s6 and s9 the tested strains were catalase positive s1 s3 s4 and s6 isolates were mobile while s2 s7 s8 and s9 strains were immobile the biochemical tests were negative for arginine dihydrolase adh lysine decarboxilase lcd ornithine decarboxilase odc h2s production urease ure indole production ind manitol fermentation oxidation man inositol fermentation oxidation ino sorbitol fermentation oxidation sor rhamnose fermentation oxidation rha melibiose fermentation oxidation mel and arabinose fermentation oxidation ara the analytical profile index strain identification was done the eight strains were identified using morphological characteristics biochemical results and the carbohydrates utilization the identification leads to two main species burkholderia and brucella the presence of brucella spp was expected since its presence in wastewater treatment plants was demonstrated 43 biological reduction of cr vi to relatively less toxic cr iii by living and inactivated microbial biomass is considered one of the most practical and useful methods for reducing cr vi toxicity 13 a number of bacterial strains have been reported to possess cr vi reduction potential e g intrasporangium sp bacillus sp arthrobacter sp escherichia coli shewanella sp serratia marcescens vogococcus fluvialis arthrobacter aurescens burkholderia cepacia microbacterium sp pseudomonas sp pseudomonas ambigua and staphylococcus aureus and pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from tannery effluents 13 in addition the bacterial strains belonging to this genus brucella have already been reported for their potential of bioremediating a number of pollutants including chromate 13 3 3 metal ions and ions analyses five effluents from a tunisian tannery were used in this study estt basin 1 estt basin 2 estt basin 3 estt basin 4 and estt basin 5 the data represented in table 2 showed higher values of metal ions and ions in this effluent the effluent was found to have lead chloride potassium chromium cadmium nickel sodium mercury and manganese concentrations much higher than regulatory limits set by dph 34 and international standards 35 the concentration of chloride sodium and chromium in the effluent was at highest levels consequently the high sodium content resulted in the high salinity of these effluents the use of chromium during the tanning process allows revealing a high value especially at basin 3 for collecting effluents loaded with chromium 3662 mg l exceeding tunisian standards for discharges 0 05 mg l the estt basin 3 had higher load of calcium and sodium of around 905 73 mg l and 42 240 mg l respectively that reflects the higher salinity and subsequently the turbidity of estt in which the decreasing trend of metal and anions was na cl cr ca mn mg k al zn fe pb ni cd hg iron concentration was not generally exceeding the guideline limit by dph 34 although iron is one of the essential elements of the human diet its presence in high concentrations in ecosystems causes major pollution and human health problems such as vomiting cardiovascular collapse and diarrhea while iron deficiency can lead to anti clotting of the blood to replenish itself 44 in general the trend of metal and anion availability in estt basin 1 sample was na cl ca mg k mn cr pb fe ni cd zn al hg the metal ion and concentrations change from basin to basin this difference in concentrations was due to chemicals used during tanning process this process produces multi component wastewaters which usually cause difficulties and inhibitory behaviours in treatment processes 45 for estt basin 2 the trend of metal was na cl k mn hg ca pb ni al cd cr zn hg in addition the concentrations of metal ions and ions in the estt basin 4 were as follow na cl mn ca mg k ni cd cr fe pb hg therefore it is concluded that the leather industrial effluent was highly polluted and not suitable for irrigation or any other uses besides the estt basin 5 contained more metal ions and ions but are less than the standards and its trend was cl ca mg na mn k ni cd fe cr zn hg the results showed the richness of estt in ions which their content exceeded required limits 34 akan et al 44 stated that the mean concentrations of metals in tannery effluents were high compared to standard limits the accumulation of toxic metal ions in the soils receiving tannery industries effluents as well as their phytotoxicity were equally demonstrated 11 finally different estts were devoid copper sulphur selenium tin and arsenic the heavy metal ions rejected by the leather industries and other industries such as the phosphate laundries in the south west of tunisia pose a threat to the human population the marine biodiversity as well as the agricultural environment effective remediation has yet to be taken care of 12 since metal ions are not biodegradable a real threat to the environment and hence persist in the environment for centuries 46 3 4 spectral characterization of industrial effluents from the southern tunisian tannery the spectral characterization of these effluents fig 2 a b c d e from the five basins shows the presence of major absorbance peaks in the uv range at 215 and 275 nm for basin 1 fig 2a 230 nm for basin 2 fig 2b 230 265 285 425 and 580 nm for basin 3 fig 2c and 285 nm for basin 4 fig 2d and basin 5 fig 2e these peaks can be attributed to the phenolic compounds associated with the heavy metals present namely manganese 275 nm lead and magnesium 285 nm iron 250 nm zinc 215 nm and nickel and cadmium 230 nm in addition following the chemical reactions of the various agents used during tanning the formation of sodium oxide na2o and calcium oxide cao which absorb around 250 nm was observed the 280 nm band can be attributed to proteins this result can be explained by the denaturation of proteins due to the basic ph and the high content of heavy metals cr pb fe and ni in addition the major peak at 580 nm at basin 3 can be attributed to the sodium presence the spectral analysis confirmed the presence of metals ions mentioned in table 2 the infrared spectra fig 2a b c d e obtained for the different samples show similar curves an absorption band around 3320 cm 1 reflects the stretching vibration of hydroxyl groups oh 47 a strong adsorption band was observed for sample basin 1 fig 2a and the weakest one is observed in sample basin 2 fig 2b this means the disappearance of hydroxyl compounds during treatment process the absorption bands around 2900 and 2850 cm 1 have been attributed to asymmetric vibrations of aromatic ch and methoxyl groups och3 47 48 these bands appear only on the spectrum of sample basin 1 fig 2a which justifies the elimination of organic matter during the tanning process the presence of organic matter is also verified by the presence of strong absorption bands around 1605 and 1450 cm 1 particularly in basin 1 fig 2a and basin 3 fig 2c samples in fact these adsorption bands translate vibrations corresponding in particular to the cc bonds of the aromatic rings 49 present in the wastewater the appearance of a peak in the spectra of basin 1 basin 2 and basin 3 fig 2a b and c respectively samples around 940 cm 1 related to the presence of aluminum 50 52 which is in agreement with the results of table 2 the intense band at 1030 cm 1 corresponds to the phosphates 53 54 low intensity thin bands around 695 cm 1 and strong bands around 870 and 1415 cm 1 were attributed to carbonates reflecting the presence of calcium and calcium oxide 55 table 2 3 5 toxicity studies the relative sensitivity of the bacterial strains e coli and b subtilis towards the estt from different basins 1 2 3 4 and 5 was studied micro toxicity assay was done on the nutrient broth medium as control and on nutrient broth medium supplemented with raw and diluted effluent from the five basins the results of this monitoring are presented in fig 3 the micro toxicity study showed that the untreated effluents basin 1 basin 2 and basin 3 totally inhibited the growth of e coli and b subtilis as was expected raw estt wastewaters from basin 1 2 and 3 were very toxic due the high amounts of metal ions cr mn fe ni cd pb al and zn as showed in table 2 in fact effluent from basin 1 was highly toxic at 50 for bacillus subtilis fig 3a and for e coli fig 3a in addition 25 raw wastewater from basin 2 inhibited 22 and 80 the growth of b subtilis fig 3b and e coli fig 3b respectively not surprising effluent from basin 3 was very toxic at 25 with a percentage of inhibition growth equal to 98 for the two used strains there is no growth for both e coli and b subtilis due to the high amount of cr exceeding 3662 mg l fig 3c and c however the growth curves of the two bacterial strains on the media supplemented with the effluents from basins 4 and 5 exhibited a decrease in the inhibition levels moreover basin 4 raw effluents 25 were less toxic since the bacterial growth of e coli and b subtilis was inhibited up to 60 and 50 this inhibition was accentuated at 100 of raw basin 4 basin effluent and was 66 73 for the two bacteria fig 3d and d at 100 of basin 5 raw effluent basin the percentage of growth inhibition was decreased to 55 for b subtilis and 65 for e coli these results suggested that consortium treatment led to an important decrease of the toxicity and could be consequently efficient for tannery wastewater treatment with improvement of the physico chemical parameters in fact as mentioned in fig 3 growth kinetics indicated different slopes the growth of bacterial strains decelerates when high levels of raw effluents basin 1 basin 2 and basin 3 were added to the medium even with a four time diluted effluent a considerable inhibition of both e coli and b subtilis growth was obtained this growth was explained by the dilution of the major metal ions such as cr fe ni cd pb al and zn as well as the ions na ca and cl however after bacterial treatment assays growth patterns of the bacterial strains were similar to the growth patterns on nb medium especially with 25 of treated effluents the best results of this monitoring were obtained for b subtilis strain besides these results demonstrate that e coli seems to be more sensitive than b subtilis indeed the difference in sensitivity was evident since e coli was gram and b subtilis was gram for all basins e coli was more inhibited for all basins than b subtilis as mentioned in fig 3 a overall the ability of the used consortium to reduce organic and mineral pollution as well as the toxicity of tannery effluents under non optimised conditions was confirmed and could be a good alternative for improvement of this treatment after several optimizations for industrial bioreactor scale besides the tannery effluent treatment plants commonly use the coagulation flocculation which is relatively a much expensive method that produces sludge with high level of chemicals thus this biological process could be an eco friendly and an economic alternative to solve the excessive use of chemicals since chromium could be regenerated and reused 4 4 conclusion and future prospective the physico chemical microbiological and spectral characterizations of the estt five basins were done as well as the toxicity evaluation the results concluded that biological treatment caused significant reductions in pollutant load in the tannery effluent being discharge from the tannery the results showed that the untreated effluents were alkaline very saline rich in potentially toxic metals having a high microflora content and a bod5 cod ratio favorable to possible biodegradability however the reduction of pollutants such as tds bod cod and tss was more effective after the bacteria action basin 4 and 5 in addition almost the metal ions and ions concentration was reduced the micro toxicity study showed that the untreated effluents basin 1 basin 2 and basin 3 totally inhibited the growth of e coli and b subtilis in addition basin 3 having the high amount of cr 3662 mg l was very toxic with 98 of growth inhibition for the two used strains raw effluent basin 4 and 5 having a decreased growth inhibition percentage for b subtilis and e coli disposal of this tannery wastewater type is not safe to discharge without proper treatment as it alters the physicochemical properties of the water creating a harmful effect on the ecosystem and the people residing in the tannery industrial area are at high risk of diseases since the experimental conditions have been achieved it can be interpreted that the effluent is highly toxic and can also act as a major pollutant of water and soil in the respective area greatly affecting environment friendly microorganisms plants and human beings however there is a need to improve the used consortium treating the estt effluent as well as the optimization of the various biotic and abiotic parameters which are the objective of our next study furthermore this works suggests that immobilized cell methods of bacterial treatment can be used in tannery effluent treatment to reduce pollution

pb 83 87 at same conditions during rcps treatment lignin peroxidase lip manganese peroxidase mnp and laccase enzyme activities were also recorded indicating that these enzymes are involved in rcps degradation the rcps present in tiww and their metabolites produced during the treatment process were identified by ft ir and gc ms analysis in addition the toxicity studies showed that metabolites of rcps allowed 100 90 seed germination with significant improvement in root length shoot length and biomass production in vigna radiata and vigna mungo indicating that the developed bacterial consortium rks amp was effective in degradation and detoxification of rcps thus this newly developed bacterial consortium rks amp can be used effectively in degradation and detoxification of textile industry

export 2000 billion of market value and around 120 million employments for urban and rural peoples 2 3 but tis discharge a large volume of highly polluted wastewater into the environment in china and india around 1 84 109 m3 and 640 million m3 wastewater is discharged from tis annually 4 5 textile industry wastewater tiww is characterized by dark color high ph biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total dissolved solids tds total suspended solids tss and total organic carbon toc 1 2 6 in addition tiww has various recalcitrant coloring pollutants rcps dyes organic chemicals and toxic metal ions 1 3 among these rcps are the major source of environmental pollution and health hazards 1 4 more than thousands of rcps are used in tis 70 of dyes are not fixed to fibers and 300 000 tons of rcps are discharged into the environment worldwide 2 4 rcps are recalcitrant in nature and transported to a long distance along with wastewater persist in environment for long time and cause severe threats to water soil and living organisms 3 4 in water ecosystem rcps reduce sunlight penetration power photosynthetic activity of aquatic plants and dissolved oxygen do content and thus increases cod bod and toc level and gives dark color to receiving water bodies which ultimately damage aquatic life flora fauna 1 6 in soil ecosystem these cause detrimental effects on soil property and microbial diversity by the accumulation of rcps and heavy metals 6 7 rcps inhibit seed germination root length shoot length and biomass production in plants 2 7 rcps cause nausea haemorrhage and ulceration of skin and also cause cancer of spleen and urinary blander in humans and animals 1 4 7 tiww causes allergy asthma skin eczema immunosuppression hypersensitivity and intercalate with helical structure of dna duplex rna and partitioned to lipid membrane of living cells 4 8 rcps also reported as carcinogenic mutagenic teratogenic allergenic and cytotoxic to rat fish mollusc microbe and mammalian cells 2 3 rcps damage heart lung liver and kidneys in living beings 9 10 tiww also reduced food intake growth fertility rate and damaged kidney spleen brain nervous system and reproductive system in humans and animals 2 4 11 therefore flocculation ozonation coagulation adsorption photocatalytic membrane filtration fenton photofenton coagulation flocculation electrochemical and oxidation methods are reported for treatment of industrial wastewaters 2 4 12 but all these methods are not suitable for rcps treatment due to high operating cost high energy input high maintenance cost complicated procedures higher chemicals consumption and toxic sludge formation 2 4 10 thus in present situation a cost effective eco friendly and efficient method is required to degrade detoxify the rcps of tiww the biological treatment is an eco friendly cost effective less sludge generating and efficient method to remediate tiww pollutants 4 10 biological methods use metabolic and enzymatic versatility of bacteria archaea fungi algae yeast and plants to degrade detoxify rcps from tiww 10 11 among these agents bacteria and fungi are widely reported in treatment of rcps 6 13 fungi showed limited decolorization rate take long time for complete degradation of pollutants 6 14 but bacteria have a high capability to remediate rcps 2 10 also bacteria are easy to culture fast growing on different substances and also convert pollutants into less toxic and inorganic compounds 6 15 for example several bacterial strains such as pseudomonas sphingomonas caulobactor aeromonas serratia pigmentiphaga bacillus and shewanella has been reported effective in treatment of industrial wastewater pollutants 4 10 16 the individual treatment is less effective incomplete mineralization take long time and cannot be adopted on complex substances and variable environment 5 10 14 for example brevibacillus laterosporus showed 67 decolorization of textile industry wastewater after 48 h 12 therefore the consortium treatment is more effective and sustainable approach to degrade wastewater pollutants effectively than pure single strains 4 5 10 the bacterial consortium showed more efficiency in remediation due to the synergistic role of bacterial strains than pure single strain 7 10 for example zhuang et al 11 have developed a bacterial consortium that showed 95 decolorization of methyl orange dye a bacterial consortium pseudomonas aeruginosa enterococcus faecium and p aeruginosa showed 98 decolorization of navacron ruby dye 8 thus present study

metabolites rcps are one of the major sources of environmental pollution 2 4 rcps are toxic to animals plants and aquatic fauna flora therefore the toxicity of rcps and their metabolites were evaluated in terms of phytotoxicity and microbial toxicity 2 10 1 phytotoxicity vigna radiata v radiata and vigna mungo v mungo seeds were used to evaluate the toxicity of rcps and their metabolites produced during the treatment process 6 14 these two seeds are widely used in indian agriculture crops 6 18 ten uniform healthy seeds of v radiata and v mungo were selected sterilized with mercuric chloride 2 0 and transferred to petri plates afterward the plates were daily irrigated with 5 0 ml of groundwater rcps and their metabolites and incubated in bod incubator the phytotoxicity was evaluated in terms of seed germination root length shoot length and biomass production within 7 0 days groundwater was employed as a control and phytotoxicity was done in triplicates at room temperature the germination was measured by the followed equation germination no of seeds germinated no of seeds 100 2 10 2 microbial toxicity the toxicity of rcps and their metabolites were evaluated using a microbial bioassay as reported previously 22 for this the bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 5 103 cfu ml 22 enterococcus gallinarum 2 8 103 cfu ml 23 bacillus cohnni 2 7 103 cfu ml 6 and klebsiella pneumoniae 2 8 103 cfu ml 22 were used to measure the toxicity of tiww on microbes four wells 8 0 mm diameter were made in muller hinton agar plates and two wells was filled with rcps

analysis all the data collected from the all sets of experiments was employed to test the variability and validity of the results and expressed as the means and standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of isolated bacterial strains in present study initially nineteen morphologically different bacterial strains rks1 rks19 were isolated purified and screened based on the mnp and laccase enzyme activity out of nineteen bacterial strains rks1 rks19 only two bacterial strains rks7 rks12 showed yellow and dark brown zone around the bacterial colonies on pr dye and guaiacol amended na agar plates within five days indicating the mnp and laccase enzyme activity as shown in fig 2a b further based on the enzyme production the two bacterial strains i e rks7 rks12 were selected and characterized biochemically and molecularly bacterium rks7 appeared as milky white concave and smooth colonies on na plates it was a gram positive rod shaped motile spore former and aerobic bacterium bacterium rks7 showed positive test for oxidase urease lactose fermentation citrate utilization amylase production mannitol fermentation catalase casein hydrolysis gelatinase methyl red and glucose fermentation and negative tests for lysine decarboxylase beta galactosidase voges proskauer indole production and h2s production bacterium rks12 appeared as milky white colonies on na plate it was a gram positive rod shaped non motile facultative anaerobic and non spore former bacterium bacterium rks12 showed positive tests for oxidase amylase production voges proskauer methyl red casein hydrolysis catalase gelatinase glucose fermentation citrate utilization and negative reaction for urease indole production and h2s production further following the 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis the bacterial strain rks7 and rks12 showed highest similarity with bacillus paramycoides and bacillus megaterium respectively the phylogenetic tree of rks7 and rks12 were shown in fig 3a b thus the bacterial strain rks7 and rks12 was identified as b paramycoides and b megaterium with genbank accession numbers ok001866 and ok001869 respectively 3 2 optimized environmental and nutritional parameters for the effective degradation of rcps by developed bacterial consortium rks amp different physicochemical and nutritional parameters ph incubation temperature inoculum size salt concentration shaking and static as well as carbon and nitrogen sources directly influence the microbial growth reproduction enzymatic and metabolic activity 2 4 10 17 therefore these parameters were optimized to achieve more effective decolorization of rcps by the developed bacterial consortium rks amp as shown in fig 3 3 2 1 effect of ph on rcps decolorization in present work the developed bacterial consortium rks amp was able to decolorize rcps at different ph values fig 4a at ph below and above 7 the decolorization potential of developed bacterial consortium rks amp decreased but the highest decolorization 96 was recorded at ph 7 and minimum decolorization 15 21 was recorded at ph 4 and 10 the consortium rks amp also showed 57 81 86 and 67 decolorization at ph 5 6 8 and 9 respectively the study indicated that neutral ph may be optimum for the growth of developed bacterial consortium rks amp the minimum decolorization recorded at lower and high ph might be due to the inhibition in enzymatic and metabolic activity of consortium similarly haque et al 24 recorded 97 decolorization of methyl orange by a biofilm forming consortium at ph 7 afrin et al 8 also found 97 4 decolorization of textile wastewater by the bacterial consortium at ph 7 3 2 2 effect of temperature on rcps decolorization temperature highly influences the microbial growth reproduction enzymatic and metabolic activity 4 10 in present study with increase and decrease in temperature from 30 2 c the decolorization efficiency of developed bacterial consortium rks amp was decreased the bacterial consortium showed 97 decolorization at 30 2 c within 15 h the 56 85 88 and 66 decolorization were recorded at 20 2 c 25 0c 35 2 c and 40 2 c respectively only 18 and 24 decolorization was attained at 15 2 c and 45 2 c respectively the decolorization profile of rcps by developed bacterial consortium at different temperatures is shown in fig 4b thus the optimum temperature for effective treatment was recorded to be 30 2 c but at 15 2 c and 45 2 c the decolorization efficiency was drastically decreased due to the loss of cell sustainability and enzymatic machinery 17 similarly kishor et al 17 recorded 99 decolorization of methylene blue dye at 30 2 c the highest decolorization of crystal violet and safranin dye was reported at 30 2 c 25 3 2 3 effect of inoculum size on rcps decolorization in present work different inoculum size 2 4 6 8 and 10 was used for the effective degradation of rcps by developed bacterial consortium fig 4c the 19 43 75 and 88 decolorization was recorded at 2 4 6 and 8 within 15 h respectively at 10 inoculum size 98 decolorization efficiency was recorded at same conditions however 10 inoculum size of developed bacterial consortium was optimum for the maximum decolorization of rcps the decolorization efficiency increases with increases in inoculum size it might be attributed to the increased number of bacterial cells involved in rcps degradation similarly 10 inoculum size of consortium bacterial algal was reported optimum for the maximum decolorization 99 of textile dyes 9 afrin et al 8 reported 97 4 decolorization of textile dyes by bacterial consortium at 10 inoculum size 3 2 4 effect of shaking and static condition on rcps decolorization in present study the decolorization of rcps by developed bacterial consortium was performed at shaking 100 rpm and static condition in shaking condition the consortium showed only 44 decolorization within 15 h whereas in static condition consortium showed 97 decolorization within same condition results indicated that the facultative anaerobic condition was optimum for the effective degradation of rcps similarly afrin et al 8 reported 97 4 decolorization of textile dyes by bacterial consortium in static condition 3 2 5 effect of carbon and nitrogen sources on rcps decolorization in present study 1 of different carbon sources sucrose glucose lactose maltose and starch and nitrogen sources beef extract peptone yeast extract urea and ammonium sulphate were used to achieve efficient decolorization of rcps by developed bacterial consortium fig 4d e the maximum decolorization 97 was recorded in presence of glucose in contrast the developed bacterial consortium showed 92 89 84 and 75 decolorization of rcps in presence of sucrose lactose maltose and starch respectively fig 4d the bacteria used glucose as energy and electron donor sources resulting in enhanced decolorization of rcps samuchiwal et al 5 also reported maximum decolorization 73 of textile effluent in presence of glucose by microbial consortium in case of nitrogen sources the presence of yeast extract showed the maximum 98 decolorization of rcps within 15 h while the presence of peptone beef extract urea and ammonium sulphate showed 91 73 58 and 47 decolorization respectively fig 4e similarly in presence of yeast extract 73 decolorization of textile effluent wastewater was reported by samuchiwal et al 5 3 2 6 effect of salt concentration on rcps decolorization tiww normally contains high concentration of salts which inhibit microbial growth reproduction enzymatic and metabolite activity 26 therefore the effect of different concentrations of salt 0 5 naci on decolorization efficiency of developed bacterial consortium is shown in fig 4f the decolorization of tiww by developed bacterial consortium was decreased with an increase in salt concentrations up to 5 naci at 0 1 salt concentration 96 decolorization of rcps was attained within 15 h at 2 3 4 and 5 concentrations 89 76 55 and 38 decolorization was recorded similarly ali et al 22 reported 95 degradation of textile wastewater in presence of 1 nacl 3 3 degradation and decolorization of rcps by developed bacterial consortium rks amp at optimized conditions tiww contains various rcps that cause serious threats in environment and public health 4 10 these are also highly toxic to plants growth and biomass production 2 6 therefore the bacterial consortium rks amp was developed for the effective degradation of rcps in present study the bacterial strains bacillus albus bacillus megaterium and bacillus paramycoides were used individually and their consortium for the effective degradation of rcps at optimized conditions before optimized conditions in axenic conditions b albus b megaterium and b paramycoides showed 65 47 and 48 decolorization of rcps within 15 h respectively whereas consortium showed 91 decolorization of rcps within 15 h but at optimized conditions b albus b megaterium and b paramycoides showed 72 42 58 57 and 52 79 decolorization of rcps within 15 h respectively whereas the consortium showed more than 99 decolorization of rcps at same conditions as shown in fig 5a the study indicated that 8 8 efficiency of developed bacterial consortium was increased during the degradation of rcps at optimized conditions further the results also indicated that developed bacterial consortium showed faster higher and more efficient decolorization than individual cultures it might be occurred due to the synergistic role of bacterial strains in degradation of rcps similarly ali et al 22 used a consortium than single cultures for the effective treatment of textile wastewater the bacterial consortium of pseudoarthrobacter sphingomonas and gardonia stentrophomonas showed effective decolorization of reactive black 5 dye than pure culture at optimized conditions 15 no decolorization was recorded in control a comparative study of present work with previous work reported by various researchers is shown in table 1 after decolorization 4 0 ml sample was taken centrifuged and biomass was washed with ethanol and colorless biomass was obtained indicating that decolorization was occurred due to the degradation not by adsorption 3 4 enzymatic study during degradation of rcps the degradation of industrial wastewater pollutants is only possible due to the ligninolytic enzymes present in microorganisms 4 10 the ligninolytic enzymes laccase lip and mnp can degrade and mineralize various pollutants into water and carbon dioxide 4 6 8 in present work the laccase lip and mnp enzyme was detected during the decolorization of rcps the strain b paramycoides showed laccase b megaterium showed mnp and b albus showed lip enzyme activity the ligninolytic enzymes can oxidize convert different industrial wastewater pollutants into non toxic compounds 6 10 these enzymes have high potential to degrade and detoxify various rcps such as congo red cr methylene blue mb methyl orange mo azure b ab and reactive black dye and dyeing industry wastewater 4 6 10 12 in present work it was recorded that lip mnp and laccase enzyme activity increased up to 13 43 7 54 and 9 67 iu ml till 12 h and after then steadily decreased the results of lip mnp and laccase enzyme activity during the decolorization is shown in fig 5b similarly kishor et al 6 reported that bacillus cohnni produce lip mnp and laccase enzyme which are well known to involve in decolorization of congo red dye and tiww within 12 48 h a bacterial yeast consortium produces laccase and oxidative enzymes to decolorize and degrade textile dye and textile industry effluent within 18 48 h 12 therefore the synergistic role of lip mnp and laccase enzymes may be key potential for the effective degradation of tiww 3 5 physicochemical characteristics of untreated and bacteria treated tiww in many developing countries tis discharge a large volume of dark colored highly polluted wastewater into the environment 2 6 therefore the quality of real untreated and bacteria treated tiww is very important for the disposal point of view in present work the untreated tiww showed dark color admi 1354 with high values of ph 9 56 temperature 39 c ec 6 36 μs m cod 1746 mg l bod 699 mg l toc 3801 mg l tds 7203 mg l tss 501 mg l ts 7101 mg l phenol 2 27 mg l nitrogen 11 13 mg l surfactant 9 80 mg l chloride 1731 mg l sulphate 1605 mg l and phosphate 9 33 mg l is shown in table 2 it also showed high values of cr 1 70 mg l ni 4 23 mg l cd 1 10 mg l as 2 55 mg l fe 3 15 mg l and pb 0 31 mg l table 2 all the values of various physicochemical parameters are found to be higher than permissible limit for the central pollution control board 2010 27 and the national environment quality standard 6 the high content of color in tiww might be due to the use of different rcps dyes at dyeing and printing stages in tis 6 8 the high ph and ec might be due to the used salts detergents and soaps at scouring and mercerization stage 6 the high values of cod bod and toc might be due to the presence of various rcps organic compounds and dissolved minerals 2 5 the tds tss and ts values are probably caused by the presence of dissolved organic and inorganic matters 6 10 the phenol in tiww might be due to use of phenolic compounds pentachlorophenol and phthalates in tis the chloride nitrogen and sulphate could be attributed to the use of chlorobenzenes sodium chloride trichloroethane hydrochloric acid sodium sulphate and carbon disulphide 6 the phosphate might be due to the presence of organophosphorus compounds tributylphosphate in addition the high concentration of different heavy metals might be associated with the various rcps and additive compounds 6 10 14 if real tiww is discharged without adequate treatment it may cause severe threats to environment soil water and living beings for example the color normally reduced sunlight penetration photosynthetic activity of aquatic plants dissolved oxygen content and give intensive coloration leading to damage aquatic life 3 15 the high value of bod cod and toc pose severe threats in flora and fauna due to decrease in dissolved oxygen content doc of receiving aquatic resources 6 16 the tds tss and ts cause water and soil pollution due to the alteration in ion composition and soil salinity 2 6 the phenolic compounds are well reported to be carcinogenic endocrine disrupters and impair fertility in living organisms 6 the nitrogen iron chloride sulphate and phosphate damage aquatic life plants animals and microbial diversity due to the eutrophication process 2 10 the cr cd as and pb are well reported to causes high toxicity genotoxic and carcinogenic threats on animal and human health 3 6 however the treatment of tiww is urgently needed for the safety of public health and environment after bacterial treatment the quality of tiww improved significantly with 99 83 80 88 77 93 99 72 53 71 85 76 44 71 89 85 90 65 58 34 83 41 05 and 46 83 reduction in color admi ec cod bod toc tds tss ts phenol nitrogen chloride sulphate and phosphate respectively as shown in table 2 the developed bacterial consortium also removed cr 72 35 cd 79 09 ni 83 21 as 65 88 fe 32 69 and pb 83 87 table 2 the dark color turns into the colorless transparent due to the degradation of rcps by developed bacterial consortium the reduction in ec cod bod toc tds tss ts tp tn chloride sulphate and phosphate from tiww might be due to the utilization of pollutants by bacteria as carbon and nitrogen source for their growth and metabolic activity 6 10 15 the reduction in cr zn cd ni as and pb might be associated with the bioaccumulated inside the bacterial cells or binding with the extracellular lipopolysaccharide membrane 6 16 similarly chandanshive et al 26 reported 94 color 76 cod 70 bod 75 tds and 47 tss reduction from the real textile wastewater by a consortium tp after 96 h bacterial yeast consortium was also found capable to remove 98 color 68 bod and 74 cod from real textile wastewater within 48 h 12 these results indicated that developed bacterial consortium can be used effectively in treatment of textile industry wastewater 3 6 characterization of rcps present in real tiww and their metabolites 3 6 1 uv visible spectrophotometry analysis uv vis spectroscopic technique is a basic tool to confirm the decolorization of dyes and textile wastewater 17 28 in present work the untreated tiww showed different adsorption peaks at 464 592 and 650 nm representing methyl orange mo crystal violet cv and azure b ab dye respectively but these peaks get disappeared in treated tiww due to the degradation of rcps dyes by developed bacterial consortium at optimized conditions kaur et al 28 measured the

metabolites is shown in fig 7a b similarly cao et al 14 used gc ms analysis for the identification of direct blue 2b dye metabolites produced during treatment study various organic pollutants and their metabolites present in untreated and bacteria treated tiww were characterized by gc ms analysis 6 3 7 toxicity profile of rcps present in real tiww and their metabolites 3 7 1 phytotoxicity plant bioassay is a reliable and well accepted test method to confirm the toxicity of various industrial wastewater pollutants 5 tiww having many rcps is commonly used for the irrigation of agricultural lands in china india and pakistan 4 rcps are highly toxic to plant growth and biomass production 6 therefore it is essential to study the toxicity of rcps and their metabolites on routinely growing agricultural crops in present study the seeds irrigated with rcps showed only 40 germination in v radiata and v mungo table 5 rcps also showed 92 6 and 94 8 93 7 and 93 6 and 82 6 and 89 4 inhibition in root length shoot length and biomass production of v radiata and v mungo respectively as compared to control the reduction in seed germination root length shoot length and biomass production in plants irrigated with rcps indicated that rcps are highly toxic to plants growth and biomass production but when seeds were irrigated with treated tiww 100 and 90 germination in v radiata and v mungo respectively were recorded table 5 it also showed significantly higher improvement in root length 83 9 and 92 9 shoot length 84 4 and 95 4 and biomass production 77 1 and 85 5 as compared to untreated tiww fig 8 results indicated that rcps may be degraded into less toxic metabolites by the developed bacterial consortium similarly kishor et al 6 also reported that bacteria treated tiww was less toxic to plant as compared to the untreated tiww the consortium treated textile industry effluent was reported as a less toxic to plant than untreated textile effluent 12 3 7 2 microbial toxicity the toxicity of rcps and their metabolites produced during the treatment was evaluated by well diffusion method 22 in present study rcps showed inhibitory effects on all bacterial

zone except in case of e gallinarum bacterium that was 8 7 0 85 mm similar pattern of toxicity for textile wastewater was also reported by ali et al 22 and kenawy et al 29 the results of microbial toxicity suggested that developed bacterial consortium can convert rcps into non less toxic metabolites 4 conclusion in present study an efficient new bacterial consortium rks amp b paramycoides b megaterium and b albus capable for the degradation of real tiww was developed the bacterial consortium showed 99 28 decolorization of rcps with significantly reduction in ec 83 80 cod 88 77 bod 93 99 toc 72 53 tds 71 85 tss 76 44 and phenol 85 90 within 15 h at optimized conditions it also showed 72 35 79 09 65 88 and 83 87 reduction in cr cd as and pb respectively the optimized conditions were found to be ph 7 temperature 30 2 c inoculum size 10 salt concentration 1 static condition glucose and yeast extract lip mnp and laccase enzyme activities were recorded during treatment process indicating their role in degradation of rcps various rcps present in real tiww and their metabolites produced during treatment were characterized by uv vis spectroscopy ft ir and gc ms analysis the

degradation the rcps present in tiww and their metabolites produced during the treatment process were identified by ft ir and gc ms analysis in addition the toxicity studies showed that metabolites of rcps allowed 100 90 seed germination with significant improvement in root length shoot length and biomass production in vigna radiata and vigna mungo indicating that the developed bacterial consortium rks amp was effective in degradation and detoxification of rcps thus this newly developed bacterial consortium rks amp can be used effectively in degradation and detoxification of textile industry wastewater pollutants graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords recalcitrant coloring pollutants textile industry wastewater bacterial consortium degradation ligninolytic enzyme ft ir analysis gc ms analysis toxicity 1 introduction textile industries tis play a major role by contributing to global economy in developing countries 1 2 worldwide tis contribute 5 of total textile trade 5 of total export 2000 billion of market value and around 120 million employments for urban and rural peoples 2 3 but tis discharge a large volume of highly polluted wastewater into the environment in china and india around 1 84 109 m3 and 640 million m3 wastewater is discharged from tis annually 4 5 textile industry wastewater tiww is characterized by dark color high ph biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total dissolved solids tds total suspended solids tss and total organic carbon toc 1 2 6 in addition tiww has various recalcitrant coloring pollutants rcps dyes organic chemicals and toxic metal ions 1 3 among these rcps are the major source of environmental pollution and health hazards 1 4 more than thousands of rcps are used in tis 70 of dyes are not fixed to fibers and 300 000 tons of rcps are discharged into the environment worldwide 2 4 rcps are recalcitrant in nature and transported to a long distance along with wastewater persist in environment for long time and cause severe threats to water soil and living organisms 3 4 in water ecosystem rcps reduce sunlight penetration power photosynthetic activity of aquatic plants and dissolved oxygen do content and thus increases cod bod and toc level and gives dark color to receiving water bodies which ultimately damage aquatic life flora fauna 1 6 in soil ecosystem these cause detrimental effects on soil property and microbial diversity by the accumulation of rcps and heavy metals 6 7 rcps inhibit seed germination root length shoot length and biomass production in plants 2 7 rcps cause nausea haemorrhage and ulceration of skin and also cause cancer of spleen and urinary blander in humans and animals 1 4 7 tiww causes allergy asthma skin eczema immunosuppression hypersensitivity and intercalate with helical structure of dna duplex rna and partitioned to lipid membrane of living cells 4 8 rcps also reported as carcinogenic mutagenic teratogenic allergenic and cytotoxic to rat fish mollusc microbe and mammalian cells 2 3 rcps damage heart lung liver and kidneys in living beings 9 10 tiww also reduced food intake growth fertility rate and damaged kidney spleen brain nervous system and reproductive system in humans and animals 2 4 11 therefore flocculation ozonation coagulation adsorption photocatalytic membrane filtration fenton photofenton coagulation flocculation electrochemical and oxidation methods are reported for treatment of industrial wastewaters 2 4 12 but all these methods are not suitable for rcps treatment due to high operating cost high energy input high maintenance cost complicated procedures higher chemicals consumption and toxic sludge formation 2 4 10 thus in present situation a cost effective eco friendly and efficient method is required to degrade detoxify the rcps of tiww the biological treatment is an eco friendly cost effective less sludge generating and efficient method to remediate tiww pollutants 4 10 biological methods use metabolic and enzymatic versatility of bacteria archaea fungi algae yeast and plants to degrade detoxify rcps from tiww 10 11 among these agents bacteria and fungi are widely reported in treatment of rcps 6 13 fungi showed limited decolorization rate take long time for complete degradation of pollutants 6 14 but bacteria have a high capability to remediate rcps 2 10 also bacteria are easy to culture fast growing on different substances and also convert pollutants into less toxic and inorganic compounds 6 15 for example several bacterial strains such as pseudomonas sphingomonas caulobactor aeromonas serratia pigmentiphaga bacillus and shewanella has been reported effective in treatment of industrial wastewater pollutants 4 10 16 the individual treatment is less effective incomplete mineralization take long time and cannot be adopted on complex substances and variable environment 5 10 14 for example brevibacillus laterosporus showed 67 decolorization of textile industry wastewater after 48 h 12 therefore the consortium treatment is more effective and sustainable approach to degrade wastewater pollutants effectively than pure single strains 4 5 10 the bacterial consortium showed more efficiency in remediation due to the synergistic role of bacterial strains than pure single strain 7 10 for example zhuang et al 11 have developed a bacterial consortium that showed 95 decolorization of methyl orange dye a bacterial consortium pseudomonas aeruginosa enterococcus faecium and p aeruginosa showed 98 decolorization of navacron ruby dye 8 thus present study aimed to develop a new cost effective and potential bacterial consortium rks amp for the efficient degradation of rcps from tiww analyze the physico chemical parameters of untreated and treated tiww optimize different parameters temperature ph inoculum size salt concentration shaking and static condition and carbon and nitrogen sources for the efficient degradation of rcps to study lip mnp and laccase enzymes during the degradation of rcps characterize rcps and their metabolites by ft ir and gc ms analysis as well as evaluate the toxicity of untreated and treated tiww for environmental

casein hydrolysis catalase gelatinase glucose fermentation citrate utilization and negative reaction for urease indole production and h2s production further following the 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis the bacterial strain rks7 and rks12 showed highest similarity with bacillus paramycoides and bacillus megaterium respectively the phylogenetic tree of rks7 and rks12 were shown in fig 3a b thus the bacterial strain rks7 and rks12 was identified as b paramycoides and b megaterium with genbank accession numbers ok001866 and ok001869 respectively 3 2 optimized environmental and nutritional parameters for the effective degradation of rcps by developed bacterial consortium rks amp different physicochemical and nutritional parameters ph incubation temperature inoculum size salt concentration shaking and static as well as carbon and nitrogen sources directly influence the microbial growth reproduction enzymatic and metabolic activity 2 4 10 17 therefore these parameters were optimized to achieve more effective decolorization of rcps by the developed bacterial consortium rks amp as shown in fig 3 3 2 1 effect of ph on rcps decolorization in present work the developed bacterial consortium rks amp was able to decolorize rcps at different ph values fig 4a at ph below and above 7 the decolorization potential of developed bacterial consortium rks amp decreased but the highest decolorization 96 was recorded at ph 7 and minimum decolorization 15 21 was recorded at ph 4 and 10 the consortium rks amp also showed 57 81 86 and 67 decolorization at ph 5 6 8 and 9 respectively the study indicated that neutral ph may be optimum for the growth of developed bacterial consortium rks amp the minimum decolorization recorded at lower and high ph might be due to the inhibition in enzymatic and metabolic activity of consortium similarly haque et al 24 recorded 97 decolorization of methyl orange by a biofilm forming consortium at ph 7 afrin et al 8 also found 97 4 decolorization of textile wastewater by the bacterial consortium at ph 7 3 2 2 effect of temperature on rcps decolorization temperature highly influences the microbial growth reproduction enzymatic and metabolic activity 4 10 in present study with increase and decrease in temperature from 30 2 c the decolorization efficiency of developed bacterial consortium rks amp was decreased the bacterial consortium showed 97 decolorization at 30 2 c within 15 h the 56 85 88 and 66 decolorization were recorded at 20 2 c 25 0c 35 2 c and 40 2 c respectively only 18 and 24 decolorization was attained at 15 2 c and 45 2 c respectively the decolorization profile of rcps by developed bacterial consortium at different temperatures is shown in fig 4b thus the optimum temperature for effective treatment was recorded to be 30 2 c but at 15 2 c and 45 2 c the decolorization efficiency was drastically decreased due to the loss of cell sustainability and enzymatic machinery 17 similarly kishor et al 17 recorded 99 decolorization of methylene blue dye at 30 2 c the highest decolorization of crystal violet and safranin dye was reported at 30 2 c 25 3 2 3 effect of inoculum size on rcps decolorization in present work different inoculum size 2 4 6 8 and 10 was used for the effective degradation of rcps by developed bacterial consortium fig 4c the 19 43 75 and 88 decolorization was recorded at 2 4 6 and 8 within 15 h respectively at 10 inoculum size 98 decolorization efficiency was recorded at same conditions however 10 inoculum size of developed bacterial consortium was optimum for the maximum decolorization of rcps the decolorization efficiency increases with increases in inoculum size it might be attributed to the increased number of bacterial cells involved in rcps degradation similarly 10 inoculum size of consortium bacterial algal was reported optimum for the maximum decolorization 99 of textile dyes 9 afrin et al 8 reported 97 4 decolorization of textile dyes by bacterial consortium at 10 inoculum size 3 2 4 effect of shaking and static condition on rcps decolorization in present study the decolorization of rcps by developed bacterial consortium was performed at shaking 100 rpm and static condition in shaking condition the consortium showed only 44 decolorization within 15 h whereas in static condition consortium showed 97 decolorization within same condition results indicated that the facultative anaerobic condition was optimum for the effective degradation of rcps similarly afrin et al 8 reported 97 4 decolorization of textile dyes by bacterial consortium in static condition 3 2 5 effect of carbon and nitrogen sources on rcps decolorization in present study 1 of different carbon sources sucrose glucose lactose maltose and starch and nitrogen sources beef extract peptone yeast extract urea and ammonium sulphate were used to achieve efficient decolorization of rcps by developed bacterial consortium fig 4d e the maximum decolorization 97 was recorded in presence of glucose in contrast the developed bacterial consortium showed 92 89 84 and 75 decolorization of rcps in presence of sucrose lactose maltose and starch respectively fig 4d the bacteria used glucose as energy and electron donor sources resulting in enhanced decolorization of rcps samuchiwal et al 5 also reported maximum decolorization 73 of textile effluent in presence of glucose by microbial consortium in case of nitrogen sources the presence of yeast extract showed the maximum 98 decolorization of rcps within 15 h while the presence of peptone beef extract urea and ammonium sulphate showed 91 73 58 and 47 decolorization respectively fig 4e similarly in presence of yeast extract 73 decolorization of textile effluent wastewater was reported by samuchiwal et al 5 3 2 6 effect of salt concentration on rcps decolorization tiww normally contains high concentration of salts which inhibit microbial growth reproduction enzymatic and metabolite activity 26 therefore the effect of different concentrations of salt 0 5 naci on decolorization efficiency of developed bacterial consortium is shown in fig 4f the decolorization of tiww by developed bacterial consortium was decreased with an increase in salt concentrations up to 5 naci at 0 1 salt concentration 96 decolorization of rcps was attained within 15 h at 2 3 4 and 5 concentrations 89 76 55 and 38 decolorization was recorded similarly ali et al 22 reported 95 degradation of textile wastewater in presence of 1 nacl 3 3 degradation and decolorization of rcps by developed bacterial consortium rks amp at optimized conditions tiww contains various rcps that cause serious threats in environment and public health 4 10 these are also highly toxic to plants growth and biomass production 2 6 therefore the bacterial consortium rks amp was developed for the effective degradation of rcps in present study the bacterial strains bacillus albus bacillus megaterium and bacillus paramycoides were used individually and their consortium for the effective degradation of rcps at optimized conditions before optimized conditions in axenic conditions b albus b megaterium and b paramycoides showed 65 47 and 48 decolorization of rcps within 15 h respectively whereas consortium showed 91 decolorization of rcps within 15 h but at optimized conditions b albus b megaterium and b paramycoides showed 72 42 58 57 and 52 79 decolorization of rcps within 15 h respectively whereas the consortium showed more than 99 decolorization of rcps at same conditions as shown in fig 5a the study indicated that 8 8 efficiency of developed bacterial consortium was increased during the degradation of rcps at optimized conditions further the results also indicated that developed bacterial consortium showed faster higher and more efficient decolorization than individual cultures it might be occurred due to the synergistic role of bacterial strains in degradation of rcps similarly ali et al 22 used a consortium than single cultures for the effective treatment of textile wastewater the bacterial consortium of pseudoarthrobacter sphingomonas and gardonia stentrophomonas showed effective decolorization of reactive black 5 dye than pure culture at optimized conditions 15 no decolorization was recorded in control a comparative study of present work with previous work reported by various researchers is shown in table 1 after decolorization 4 0 ml sample was taken centrifuged and biomass was washed with ethanol and colorless biomass was obtained indicating that decolorization was occurred due to the degradation not by adsorption 3 4 enzymatic study during degradation of rcps the degradation of industrial wastewater pollutants is only possible due to the ligninolytic enzymes present in microorganisms 4 10 the ligninolytic enzymes laccase lip and mnp can degrade and mineralize various pollutants into water and carbon dioxide 4 6 8 in present work the laccase lip and mnp enzyme was detected during the decolorization of rcps the strain b paramycoides showed laccase b megaterium showed mnp and b albus showed lip enzyme activity the ligninolytic enzymes can oxidize convert different industrial wastewater pollutants into non toxic compounds 6 10 these enzymes have high potential to degrade and detoxify various rcps such as congo red cr methylene blue mb methyl orange mo azure b ab and reactive black dye and dyeing industry wastewater 4 6 10 12 in present work it was recorded that lip mnp and laccase enzyme activity increased up to 13 43 7 54 and 9 67 iu ml till 12 h and after then steadily decreased the results of lip mnp and laccase enzyme activity during the decolorization is shown in fig 5b similarly kishor et al 6 reported that bacillus cohnni produce lip mnp and laccase enzyme which are well known to involve in decolorization of congo red dye and tiww within 12 48 h a bacterial yeast consortium produces laccase and oxidative enzymes to decolorize and degrade textile dye and textile industry effluent within 18 48 h 12 therefore the synergistic role of lip mnp and laccase enzymes may be key potential for the effective degradation of tiww 3 5 physicochemical characteristics of untreated and bacteria treated tiww in many developing countries tis discharge a large volume of dark colored highly polluted wastewater into the environment 2 6 therefore the quality of real untreated and bacteria treated tiww is very important for the disposal point of view in present work the untreated tiww showed dark color admi 1354 with high values of ph 9 56 temperature 39 c ec 6 36 μs m cod 1746 mg l bod 699 mg l toc 3801 mg l tds 7203 mg l tss 501 mg l ts 7101 mg l phenol 2 27 mg l nitrogen 11 13 mg l surfactant 9 80 mg l chloride 1731 mg l sulphate 1605 mg l and phosphate 9 33 mg l is shown in table 2 it also showed high values of cr 1 70 mg l ni 4 23 mg l cd 1 10 mg l as 2 55 mg l fe 3 15 mg l and pb 0 31 mg l table 2 all the values of various physicochemical parameters are found to be higher than permissible limit for the central pollution control board 2010 27 and the national environment quality standard 6 the high content of color in tiww might be due to the use of different rcps dyes at dyeing and printing stages in tis 6 8 the high ph and ec might be due to the used salts detergents and soaps at scouring and mercerization stage 6 the high values of cod bod and toc might be due to the presence of various rcps organic compounds and dissolved minerals 2 5 the tds tss and ts values are probably caused by the presence of dissolved organic and inorganic matters 6 10 the phenol in tiww might be due to use of phenolic compounds pentachlorophenol and phthalates in tis the chloride nitrogen and sulphate could be attributed to the use of chlorobenzenes sodium chloride trichloroethane hydrochloric acid sodium sulphate and carbon disulphide 6 the phosphate might be due to the presence of organophosphorus compounds tributylphosphate in addition the high concentration of different heavy metals might be associated with the various rcps and additive compounds 6 10 14 if real tiww is discharged without adequate treatment it may cause severe threats to environment soil water and living beings for example the color normally reduced sunlight penetration photosynthetic activity of aquatic plants dissolved oxygen content and give intensive coloration leading to damage aquatic life 3 15 the high value of bod cod and toc pose severe threats in flora and fauna due to decrease in dissolved oxygen content doc of receiving aquatic resources 6 16 the tds tss and ts cause water and soil pollution due to the alteration in ion composition and soil salinity 2 6 the phenolic compounds are well reported to be carcinogenic endocrine disrupters and impair fertility in living organisms 6 the nitrogen iron chloride sulphate and phosphate damage aquatic life plants animals and microbial diversity due to the eutrophication process 2 10 the cr cd as and pb are well reported to causes high toxicity genotoxic and carcinogenic threats on animal and human health 3 6 however the treatment of tiww is urgently needed for the safety of public health and environment after bacterial treatment the quality of tiww improved significantly with 99 83 80 88 77 93 99 72 53 71 85 76 44 71 89 85 90 65 58 34 83 41 05 and 46 83 reduction in color admi ec cod bod toc tds tss ts phenol nitrogen chloride sulphate and phosphate respectively as shown in table 2 the developed bacterial consortium also removed cr 72 35 cd 79 09 ni 83 21 as 65 88 fe 32 69 and pb 83 87 table 2 the dark color turns into the colorless transparent due to the degradation of rcps by developed bacterial consortium the reduction in ec cod bod toc tds tss ts tp tn chloride sulphate and phosphate from tiww might be due to the utilization of pollutants by bacteria as carbon and nitrogen source for their growth and metabolic activity 6 10 15 the reduction in cr zn cd ni as and pb might be associated with the bioaccumulated inside the bacterial cells or binding with the extracellular lipopolysaccharide membrane 6 16 similarly chandanshive et al 26 reported 94 color 76 cod 70 bod 75 tds and 47 tss reduction from the real textile wastewater by a consortium tp after 96 h bacterial yeast consortium was also found capable to remove 98 color 68 bod and 74 cod from real textile wastewater within 48 h 12 these results indicated that developed bacterial consortium can be used effectively in treatment of textile industry wastewater 3 6 characterization of rcps present in real tiww and their metabolites 3 6 1 uv visible spectrophotometry analysis uv vis spectroscopic technique is a basic tool to confirm the decolorization of dyes and textile wastewater 17 28 in present work the untreated tiww showed different adsorption peaks at 464 592 and 650 nm representing methyl orange mo crystal violet cv and azure b ab dye respectively but these peaks get disappeared in treated tiww due to the degradation of rcps dyes by developed bacterial consortium at optimized conditions kaur et al 28 measured the decolorization of textile industry wastewater by uv vis spectrophotometer uv vis spectrum of untreated and treated tiww is shown as supplementary material in fig 1 3 6 2 ft ir analysis the ft ir analysis is an analytical technique used to confirm various functional groups present in rcps and their metabolites by developed bacterial consortium the ft ir spectrum of rcps and their metabolites showed different peaks as shown in fig 6a b in rcps the peak appeared at 3444 4 cm 1 showed the presence of nh stretching of aromatic amines and amides 6 fig 6a the peaks were recorded at 1634 6 cm 1 for co and nh2 deformation in primary amines 1354 3 cm 1 for no2 sym stretching of nitro compounds and 1127 3 cm 1 for cs stretching in thiocarbonyl compounds respectively 6 17 the peaks appeared at 1425 0 cm 1 and 870 3 cm 1 for oh and ch2 bending respectively 4 13 28 the peaks appeared at 814 7 692 5 and 622 2 cm 1 for ch cccho and oh deformation that representing 1 2 4 trisubst benzenes aldehydes compounds and phenolic compounds respectively 6 13 but after treatment different metabolites were produced which appeared at 3415 7 2962 4 1661 3 and 1596 5 cm 1 for oh ch cn and nh2 stretching fig 6b respectively the peaks were recorded at 1407 8 1308 2 1131 2 and 622 9 cm 1 for oh nno cs and oh deformation respectively similarly cao et al 14 used ft ir analysis to characterize the functional groups present in direct blue 2b dye and its metabolites kishor et al 6 also used ft ir analysis for the characterization of functional groups present in untreated and treated tiww pollutants the results indicated that developed bacterial consortium may degrade rcps into metabolites 3 6 3 gc ms analysis in present study various rcps were found in real untreated tiww by gc ms analysis as shown in fig 7 table 3 most of rcps are highly toxic persistent and aromatic in nature table 3 in gc ms analysis various peaks recorded at rt 7 64 10 31 13 23 16 47 18 61 19 42 21 82 25 37

phenol respectively many other peaks also recorded at rt 37 32 38 98 41 54 45 74 and 50 63 corresponding to the presence of glycerol monostearate dotriacontane 1 iodo heptadecane phenol 2 4 bis 1 1 dimethylethyl phosphite and tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate respectively table 3 the phenolic compounds such as carbolic acid phenol pentachlorophenol and phenol 2 4 bis 1 1 dimethylethyl phosphite are used to prepare dyes antimicrobial agents phase change and protective agents and antifouling paint ingredients in tis 4 10 phenolic compounds are well reported as carcinogenic and damage liver red blood cells and kidney 4 10 21 these also inhibit root hypocotyl growth water and minerals uptake as well as photosynthesis and enzymatic activity in plants 4 the dyes components like 2 octen 1 ol 3 7 dimethyl isobutyrate tetracosamethylcyclo dodecasiloxane and 2 6 dichloro 4 1 1 dimethyl ethyl phenol are used in dyeing and printing stages during textile production process 7 15 dyes are highly toxic to all forms of life 2 13 these are also toxic to aquatic life due to reduction in doc photosynthetic activity and increase in bod and cod level 15 phthalic acid like 1 2 benzendicarboxylic acid and phthalic acid 2 chloropropyl isobutyl ester are used as an adhesive printing ink detergent and surfactant agent in tis 7 28 phthalic acid is reported as a carcinogenic aquatic toxicant and endocrine disrupting agent as well as causes malformations fetal death and reproductive toxicity to living beings 4 10 the o ethyl hydroxylamine and 1 ethoxy 2 propanol are used as antibacterial and solvent agent in printing and writing inks during the printing process 2 9 these compounds are highly toxic to public health and environment in addition the dodecamethylcyclo hexasiloxane is used as a cleaning agent stearic acid as a surfactant and softening agent 1 monomyristin as an antimicrobial agent glycerol monostearate as an emulsifier agent dotriacontane 1 iodo as a boiling solvent and tris 2 4 di tert butylphenyl phosphate as an stabilizing agent in tis 7 9 28 all these compounds are well reported to cause severe threats to the environment and living organisms 2 7 15 after bacterial treatment different new compounds metabolites were identified at rt 7 74 11 11 13 01 15 99 21 71 24 60 29 79 and 39 42 indicating the presence of 2 3h thiazolone 4 methyl pentan

trimethylsilyl dichloroacetic acid heptadecyl ester and octadecane 3 ethyl 5 2 ethylbutyl respectively table 4 in addition many other peaks were also recorded at rt 42 05 45 75 and 33 15 35 58 corresponding to 9 desoxo 9x hydroxy 7 ketoingol phenol 2 4 bis 1 1 dimethylethyl phosphite and octatriacontyl pentafluoropropionate respectively the study indicated that rcps are degraded and transformed into the metabolites by developed bacterial consortium table 4 but only one compound i e phenol 2 4 bis 1 1 dimethylethyl phosphite was not degraded the gc ms spectrum of rcps and their metabolites is shown in fig 7a b similarly cao et al 14 used gc ms analysis for the identification of direct blue 2b dye metabolites produced during treatment study various organic pollutants and their metabolites present in untreated and bacteria treated tiww were characterized by gc ms analysis 6 3 7 toxicity profile of rcps present in real tiww and their metabolites 3 7 1 phytotoxicity plant bioassay is a reliable and well accepted test method to confirm the toxicity of various industrial wastewater pollutants 5 tiww having many rcps is commonly used for the irrigation of agricultural lands in china india and pakistan 4 rcps are highly toxic to plant growth and biomass production 6 therefore it is essential to study the toxicity of rcps and their metabolites on routinely growing agricultural crops in present study the seeds irrigated with rcps showed only 40 germination in v radiata and v mungo table 5 rcps also showed 92 6 and 94 8 93 7 and 93 6 and 82 6 and 89 4 inhibition in root length shoot length and biomass production of v radiata and v mungo respectively as compared to control the reduction in seed germination root length shoot length and biomass production in plants irrigated with rcps indicated that rcps are highly toxic to plants growth and biomass production but when seeds were irrigated with treated tiww 100 and 90 germination in v radiata and v mungo respectively were recorded table 5 it also showed significantly higher improvement in root length 83 9 and 92 9 shoot length 84 4 and 95 4 and biomass production 77 1 and 85 5 as compared to untreated tiww fig 8 results indicated that rcps may be degraded into less toxic metabolites by the developed bacterial consortium similarly kishor et al 6 also reported that bacteria treated tiww was less toxic to plant as compared to the untreated tiww the consortium treated textile industry effluent was reported as a less toxic to plant than untreated textile effluent 12 3 7 2 microbial toxicity the toxicity of rcps and their metabolites produced during the treatment was evaluated by well diffusion method 22 in present study rcps showed inhibitory effects on all bacterial strains such as p aeruginosa 30 8 1 12 mm k quansipneumoniae 33 9 1 4 mm e gallinarum 35 4 1 11 mm b cohnni 28 8 1 13 mm and k pneumoniae 31 3 1 82 but after treatment metabolites showed no inhibition zone except in case of e gallinarum bacterium that was 8 7 0 85 mm similar pattern of toxicity for textile wastewater was also reported by ali et al 22 and kenawy et al 29 the results of microbial toxicity suggested that developed bacterial consortium can convert rcps into non less toxic metabolites 4 conclusion in present study an efficient new bacterial consortium rks amp b paramycoides b megaterium and b albus capable for the degradation of real tiww was developed the bacterial consortium showed 99 28 decolorization of rcps with significantly reduction in ec 83 80 cod 88 77 bod 93 99 toc 72 53 tds 71 85 tss 76 44 and phenol 85 90 within 15 h at optimized conditions it also showed 72 35 79 09 65 88 and 83 87 reduction in cr cd as and pb respectively the optimized conditions were found to be ph 7 temperature 30 2 c inoculum size 10 salt concentration 1 static condition glucose and yeast extract lip mnp and laccase enzyme activities were recorded during treatment process indicating their role in degradation of rcps various rcps present in real tiww and their metabolites produced during treatment were characterized by uv vis spectroscopy ft ir and gc ms analysis the metabolites were found less toxic to v radiata and v mungo as compared to rcps hence the toxicity study showed that rcps were degraded transform into less non toxic metabolites by bacterial consortium

13022,methods by which resources and energy in wastewater are recycled have been gaining popularity as promising and sustainable ways of wastewater treatment enhanced coagulation process ecp can effectively achieve resources recovery through its synergistic separation of particles colloids and dissolved substances in this study four significant parameters of ecp influencing simultaneous c n and p recovery were obtained through the plackett burman method polyaluminium chloride pacl polyferric sulphate pfs powder activated carbon pac and zeolite considering the demanding connection between multivariate input and output parameters in practical engineering their multi objective parametric interaction and performance were investigated and optimized through the response surface method rsm on the basis of the varied values of retention efficiency specifically pfs and pacl exhibited negative synergistic effects on soluble chemical oxygen demand scod recovery while their interaction on the retention of total phosphorous tp and total nitrogen tn were not significant meanwhile pac and zeolite had positive synergistic effects on the retention of scod and on the tn recovery at high dosages and revealed negative synergistic effects on the retention of tn at low dosages however their interaction on tp recovery was insignificant according to obtained rsm model the optimized parametric conditions were 20 mg l 1 of pacl 136 mg l 1 of pfs 50 mg l 1 of zeolite and 236 mg l 1 of pac achieving the actual maximum values of 69 4 92 9 and 45 0 for the collaborative retention of scod tp and tn respectively this suggests the promising performance of ecp in multi objective pre collection for fast integrated sewage resource recovery keywords sewage resource recovery enhanced coagulation process ecp multi objective optimization response surface methodology rsm plackett burman method pb sustainability 1 introduction municipal wastewater or sewage originated from domestic sewer systems and it is no longer considered liquid waste but an economically sustainable resource although the traditional activated sludge process has stable treatment effect and good effluent quality and now occupies a huge share of the wastewater treatment market it is insufficient for efficient energy utilization and nutrient recovery to achieve carbon neutralization 1 3 under the circumstances of severe water shortage and global noticeable fossil fuel energy crisis meeting the standards of sewage treatment or reducing the cost of sewage treatment are no longer the primary objectives in sewage treatment 2 due to a level of approximately 60 of the total energy consumption caused by aeration in the activated sludge process and the difficulties in recycling n and p the process does not meet the requirements of sustainable treatment methods 4 5 currently considerable attention has been paid to recycling valuable products and energy and full material recovery is a notable sustainable research and development direction it is generally recognized that widely used conventional activated sludge treatments are unable to achieve adequate energy and resource recovery while the anaerobic digestion ad is a promising sustainable alternative which directly convert c n and p to sustainable resources rather than consume them however the low concentration of these substances is considered to be one of the major bottlenecks of the direct anaerobic treatment of domestic sewage 4 therefore in this context we aim to improve the recyclability of c n p within the same system in recent studies sewage pre concentration coupling with ad has been reported as an unconventional yet promising technology which aims to retain raw sewage organic materials and nutrients in a simplified and cost effective way the pre concentration of raw sewage can increase the efficiency of wastewater conversion to energy and decrease the costs of subsequent processing 6 current pre concentration technologies include bio flocculation membrane filtration conventional physicochemical methods or a combination thereof 6 9 the advantages of each method can be hampered by insufficient carbon conservation and concentration rates 1 10 elevated chemicals consumption and operational costs 11 13 and or limited separation of soluble organics 14 16 however the pre concentration process still needs to be optimized to realize efficient energy and resource recovery the conventional physicochemical method is inexpensive and its potential is still under investigation precipitation as one of the most widely used yet inefficient in the present 5 17 can be a notably cost effective method under optimization to achieve fast full material recovery the conventional sedimentation process separates the pollutants from the sewage by their own gravity or buoyancy but only suspended solids can be removed without colloidal and soluble pollutants 18 19 principledly the removal of colloidal and soluble pollutants can be improved by electric neutralization and adhesion to a surface namely coagulation and adsorption 20 23 nevertheless the conventional application of single coagulation or adsorption process in the pre treatment stage reveals limited separation efficiency and is insufficient for full material recovery 24 as such a combination of them was proposed as an enhanced coagulation process ecp in our previous studies to cope with the limitations of separation especially for the improvement of recovery efficiency of soluble components separation efficiency of solid liquid matters and the reduction of the dosages of reagents and this combined method can be critical for effective concentration of target recoverable pollutants 25 26 specifically there are many parameters that affect the ecp including the type of reagents mixing conditions coagulation times stirring speed etc 27 simultaneous interactive effects among the independent variables cannot be explained clearly using changing one factor at a time method which affects the prediction and evaluation of the optimal ecp parameters response surface method rsm as a statistical method to solve multivariate problems uses multiple quadratic regression equations to fit the functional relationship between factors and response values and finds optimal process parameters through the analysis of regression equations organic and nutrient pre concentration can be effectively optimized through rsm which helps to illustrate the interactive effects among tested variables 28 based upon previous application of the ecp in micro polluted water treatment 29 at present few research if any has been found on the sole use of the ecp for completing the pre concentration of domestic sewage as such the ecp was redesigned and optimized through rsm in this study to achieve effective c n p recovery for synchronized sewage pre concentration in domestic sewage in this study the plackett burman p b experiment was conducted focusing on 10 reported parameters that extensively influence the ecp four significant parameters were selected and brought to subsequent rsm using box behnken design bbd model where different levels of such four variables were identified and optimized for guiding the selection of practically optimal experimental conditions finally the maximum recovery of organic matters and nutrients under actual conditions was obtained and related interactions were explained 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw sewage characteristics raw sewage was collected from the xiao jiahe wastewater treatment plant in beijing china the characteristics of the raw sewage were given in the table s1 within the testing period the raw sewages had an average chemical oxygen demand cod of 226 6 46 5 mg l 1 total nitrogen tn of 57 5 10 5 mg l 1 and total phosphorus tp of 5 9 1 7 mg l 1 the cod concentration was less than the average influent concentration of conventional urban sewage treatment plants in china 30 while tn and tp were higher 2 2 stirring setup a zr4 4 model 4 paddle jar tester zhongrun water industry technology development co ltd from shenzhen china with several cylindrical 600 ml mixing beakers was set up for all precipitation and separation tests at the xiao jiahe wastewater treatment plant the mixing speed in step stirring mode varied from 10 to 1000 rpm which corresponds to a mixing velocity gradient g value range of 10 1000 s 1 2 3 analytical methods the cod soluble cod scod tn and tp were all tested according to the chinese national environmental protection agency standard methods 31 the sample was filtered with paper and membrane filters with a nominal pore size of 0 45 μm to eliminate particulate and colloidal cod respectively and the permeate of membrane filter was tested for scod above procedures referred to the method described by faust to explore detailed mass distribution during pre collection by the ecp 32 same procedures were brought out for determining particulate colloidal and soluble tp and tn respectively detailed fractionation was also implemented to evaluate the efficiency of resource retention according to van nieuwenhuijzen s method 33 2 4 experimental design and analysis 2 4 1 plackett burman experiment for the actual pre collection of resources in sewage it is difficult to empirically examine the influence of all process variables on the response variables so it is important to select appropriate process variables directly related to the construction of the accurate optimization model obviously the key parameters that determine the performance of multi objective sewage pre collection are yet to be explored the p b experiment design is a screening test focusing on the selection of the number and the undetermined influence of the factors on the response variables which can avoid the waste of test resources in later optimization experiments by preventing the evaluation of insignificant factors it is a two factorial i e 1 and 1 design locating significant variables for the production by screening n variables in n 1 experiments 34 the aim of p b design in this study was to identify the most impactful and cost effective parameters of the ecp on maximizing the collaborative pre collection of organic matter and nutrients in sewage with scod tp and tn retention as key indicators the empirical fundamental processes of ecp for multi objective collaborative resource pre collection include stirring coagulation and adsorption the mixing process in stirring affects coagulation by impacting the concentration of particles and water conservancy conditions 35 as such the velocity gradient x1 mixing time x2 and settling time x3 are selected as three main considered factors of stirring for p b design 36 37 as for coagulation and adsorption the type and dosage of reagents determine their performance and applicability indicating that polyaluminium chloride pacl x5 polyferric sulphate pfs x6 carboxymethyl cellulose cmc x7 and polyacrylamide pam x8 were tested for coagulation process 38 with zeolite x10 clay minerals and powder activated carbon pac x11 for adsorption process 39 all above variables were examined their significance on multi targets recovery through p b design it is also worth noting that the impact of ph was excluded in p b test due to the stable value of 7 8 in raw sewage in this study considering its few impacts on the recovery efficiency of ecp moreover adjusting ph is not common in practical operation of a wastewater treatment plant for its severe economic burden in general 11 factors x4 as the dummy variable were tested and compared for multi objective selection of key parameters at high and low levels in the p b design as shown in table s2 the schematic diagram of the ecp is shown in fig 1 the stirring process was conducted with 200 ml of raw sewage in the beakers according to the parameters set up of p b design and the concentrations of scod tp and tn sampling from 2 cm below the water surface before and after ecp were tested for the calculation of their retention the retention calculation is presented in eq 1 12 1 r c r c s c r 100 where r is the retention value and c r and c s represent the concentration of the raw sewage and supernatant after ecp respectively 2 4 2 response surface method rsm and box behnken design bbd the rsm is effective for optimizing chemical reactions and industrial processes and usually used for experimental designs 40 it can explore the interaction between multiple factors on response values through a small number of experiments and subsequently identify a set of operational conditions that are able to maximize targeted response or at the minimum maintain desirable ranges 41 42 in this study the rsm was used to assess the relationship between responses scod tp and tn retention and independent variables along with optimal response estimation by optimizing the values of key factors basically central composite design ccd and bbd are two most common used fitting models in rsm 43 however bbd outperforms ccd in this study due to its selection of centre points of factor which can avoid experiments under extreme conditions and subsequent significant test errors compared to the combination of all factors at highest level in ccd 44 45 the program of bbd was proposed by the design expert version 11 0 each of four independent variables selected from p b design tests was varied over three levels coded as 1 0 and 1 which investigate their impacts on the multi objective retention of scod tn and tp from raw sewage 46 the number of experiments n for independent variables was calculated using eq 2 47 2 n k 2 k c p where k is the number of factors k 3 cp represents the number of the central points cp 6 that can evaluate the pure error of thirty experiments considering three levels for each factor the appropriate model is selected as the quadratic model eq 3 48 3 y β 0 β i x i β ii x i 2 β ij x i x j where y is the predicted response x i and x j represents coded independent variables β 0 β i β ii β ij represents the offset term the ith linear coefficient the ith quadratic coefficient and the ijth interaction coefficient respectively the main indicators that demonstrate the significance and adequacy of the used model include the correlation coefficient r2 the model f value fisher variation ratio p value probability and adequate precision ap 49 50 2 4 3 multi objective numerical optimization the hill climbing algorithm was used for multi objective numerical optimization in addition to the design points a set of random points were checked to determine whether a more desirable solution exists 51 to find an initial feasible region the nelder mead multi dimensional pattern was used where the minimum or maximum of an objective function is directly searched in a multidimensional space through four basic procedures reflection expansion contraction and shrinkage 52 54 detailed procedures are as following 1 let x a vector of x i for i 1 n represent design variables over the optimization space which is a subset of the design space 2 let y j u j l j for j 1 m be responses with upper and or lower bounds serving as constraints 3 let y x be the response to be optimized then f x y x for minimization f x y x for maximization define the constraints as a series of discontinuous functions 4 g j x y j x u j for y j u j 5 g j x 0 for l j y j u j 6 g j x l j y j x for y j l j so this produces a system of m constraints that can be solved as an unconstrained problem via a penalty function eq 7 approach when the optimization begins in an undesirable location 7 minimize f x p j g j x where p is a penalty parameter 0 for j 1 to m the penalty parameter p starts at 1 and increases with each iteration by a factor of 100 and the number of iterations is limited to 15 which gives a penalty factor of 1030 maximum 3 result and discussion 3 1 raw sewage characterization the fractionation of the cod tn and tp concentrations of the raw sewage were described in fig 2 the percentage of particulate and colloidal cod 0 45 μm that is the easily recoverable organic part by the common coagulation process was greater than scod with a value of 64 7 while the soluble fraction whose molecular weight less than 1 kda comprised around 29 of total cod different from the situation of cod the easily recoverable part of tn and tp only comprised 8 4 and 26 5 respectively which was similar to the previous study 55 as such most resources in sewage would not be preferable for effective collection through normal separation processes in wastewater treatment therefore it is necessary to adapt the ecp to improve the retention of soluble fraction of cod tn and tp as to maximize the sewage resources recovery 3 2 plackett burman p b design as mentioned above the collection of the soluble fraction must be improved for maximizing organic recovery scod tn tp are selected as response variables in p b design considering the fact that scod only comprised around 29 of total cod while the majority of tn and tp are soluble fraction the results of retentions of scod tn and tp in p b design are listed in table 1 it is clear that the retention of scod tn and tp for 12 tests ranged between 36 and 57 30 43 89 98 2 respectively the retentions of tn were lower than that of cod and tp showing that effective retention of nitrogen through physical chemical processes remains difficult on account of positively charged soluble nitrogen that cannot be coagulated or adsorbed and be separated though the soluble fraction comprised around 73 5 of tp the retention of tp could surpass 90 which was more than the average removal efficiency of secondary biological treatment 56 57 this indicates that the p with molecular weight less than 1 kda was effectively recovered by the physical chemical processes meanwhile the retention of scod was greater than that in the previous study 58 which can be attributed to the addition of multiple adsorbents considering that the nitrogen compounds have minimal retention efficiency among all pollutants the retention rates of tp and scod were mainly considered in the selection of significant parameters an analysis of variance anova of p b design was shown in fig 3a the p value in fig 3a represents the probability of the difference between samples caused by sampling errors 59 specifically the p values of mixing time settling time and the dose of pacl pfs diatomite zeolite and pac were less than 0 05 indicating their significant impacts on the response value and statistical significance 60 to further filter significant factors that simplify rsm experiments the absolute values of the standardized effect were quantitatively compared in fig 3b as mentioned above factors notably influencing scod and tp retention were especially discussed in this section considering the impacts of adsorbents zeolite and pac rather than diatomite revealed significant effects on the retention of scod with standardized effect values of 0 0105 and 0 0297 respectively meanwhile only zeolite performed a significant factor of the retention of tp with a standardized effect value of 0 0107 therefore zeolite and pac were identified significant adsorbents proper for subsequent rsm experiments when it comes to coagulants only pacl substantially affected the retention of scod with a standardized effect value of 0 0129 whereas both pacl and pfs exhibited significance on the retention of tp with large standardized effect values of 0 0278 and 0 0435 respectively as such pacl and pfs could be selected as significant coagulants among mixing conditions settling time was the most influential factor on the retention of scod and tp while its standardized effect value was less than 0 01 indicating a minor impact in general pac substantially impacted the retention of scod which is important for improving anaerobic digestion energy recovery pfs notably influenced the retention of tp which is the important non renewable energy sources pacl and zeolite significantly affected the retention of both scod and tp therefore pacl pfs zeolite and pac were selected as four preferred significant factors for bbd optimization 3 3 bbd pacl pfs zeolite and pac were set at three levels for multi objective resource recovery tests in bbd design table s3 as such a total of 30 batches of experiments including 6 central points were carried out and 3 samples were taken in each experiment for parallel measurement all experiments set up and corresponding results are listed in table 2 the variables and responses were analysed through multiple regression analysis and evaluated the reliability of the model by anova table 3 which explains the retention performance of scod tp and tn in the ecp process the final second order polynomial models obtained from coding factors are as follows 8 y 1 65 14 0 95 x 1 2 38 x 2 1 59 x 3 10 33 x 4 3 70 x 1 x 2 0 65 x 1 x 3 1 29 x 1 x 4 1 09 x 2 x 3 2 42 x 2 x 4 1 44 x 3 x 4 0 042 x 1 2 1 75 x 2 2 2 75 x 3 2 5 90 x 4 2 9 y 2 86 89 5 71 x 1 14 18 x 2 0

2 3 94 x 1 x 3 0 48 x 1 x 4 0 35 x 2 x 3 3 47 x 2 x 4 5 90 x 3 x 4 where y 1 y 2 and y 3 represent the retention of scod tp and tn respectively x 1 x 2 x 3 and x 4 represent the dosages of pacl pfs zeolite and pac respectively the p values of eqs 8 9 and 10 were all less than 0 05 indicating that the fitting curves in the model between each factor and response were significant within the 95 confidence interval level 60 the coefficient of determination r2 implies that 91 07 96 45 and 86 29 of the variation in response could be explained by given variables and the fitting model revealed enough explanatory power in reflecting the true relationship between selected factors 61 moreover the values of r2 adj r2 adj 0 8273 0 9314 and 0 6382 for eqs 8 9 10 respectively were found in reasonable agreement with the r2 pred r2 pred 0 6456 0 8210 and 0 8210 for eqs 8 9 10 respectively considering the fact that their difference was less than 0 2 therefore it can be considered that no other factors have a significant influence on the response variable except the given factors 62 in addition the coefficients of variation cv of eqs 8 9 and 10 were 5 48 3 98 and 7 79 which were all less than 10 and the adequate precision ap were 11 530 19 939 and 11 805 which were much greater than 4 demonstrating that the signal of the model was adequate 60 fig 4 shows the difference between the predicted values of the fitted model and the actual values of the retention of scod tp and tn respectively all data points were distributed close to the reference line actual value predicted value meanwhile the normality of the residuals of the fitted model was also calculated to quantitatively evaluate the reliability of the model as shown in fig s1 the residual normal distribution data points of the three fitting models showed a linear well fitted trend as such the residuals followed a normal distribution and the fitting model extracted all the regularity information in the data 62 in general the second order polynomial model was reliable in describing the retention of scod tp and tn in the ecp process 3 4 rsm the plots of three dimensional 3d surface responses were developed by the software through multiple quadratic regression equations as shown in fig 5 to comprehensively investigate the individual and interactive effects of the independent variables on the retentions of scod tp and tn considering that there were more than two influencing factors in the response model the types of the factors were divided into the coagulants group include pacl and pfs and the adsorbents group include zeolite and pac the 3d response surface contour plots were accordingly displayed within one group range by keeping the other group at a constant level centre level with details shown in fig 5a b c d e and f principally the interaction between the two factors in a contour plot is not significant when the contour line reveals like a circular contour shape while if the contour line is more like an ellipse and has a large curvature there is a significant interaction between the two factors 63 3 4 1 coagulants group rsm as shown in fig 5a the dosages of pfs and pacl had significant interaction in the recovery of scod the retention of scod rose with the increase of the dosage of pacl when the dosage of pfs was constant and at a low level 20 mg l 1 while the rising tendency transformed into a downward trend with the increase of the dosage of pfs the trend of pfs was similar when the dosage of pacl was constant while the diversity of the retention of scod caused by pfs was greater than that of pacl this can be ascribed to the charge imbalance and floc destabilization caused by the excessive dosage of the coagulant 64 65 as such the optimal coagulant dosages of pacl and pfs were 20 mg l 1 and 150 mg l 1 achieving the optimal scod recovery rate of 68 6 considering the tp recovery shown in fig 5c the interaction between pfs and pacl dosage was not significant the retention of tp increased with the rise of the dosage of pacl with a specified dosage of pfs while the uptrend gradually moderated with enhanced dosage of pfs basically pfs prefers to coagulate with p compounds in sewage compared to the pacl as such pacl played a limited role in achieving effective coagulation with p compounds with the presence of pfs which can be attributed to the much less value of the solubility product constant of fepo4 ksp 1 3 10 22 than that of alpo4 ksp 6 3 10 19 on the other hand the retention of tp was improved with increasing dosages of pfs along with a specified dosage of pacl however the values of those were almost the same under different dosages of pacl with a pfs dosage of 150 mg l 1 which also supported above mechanism therefore the optimal dosages were 20 mg l 1 of pacl and 150 mg l 1 of pfs based on the response surface and the optimal tp recovery reaches 87 8 fig 5e shows that the interaction between the dosages of pfs and pacl was not significant in the retention of tn whichever the dosage of pfs or pacl was constant the retention of tn declined with the increase of the dosage of the other coagulant this implies that pfs and pacl had negative effect on the tn recovery this corresponds to the phenomenon that the sites of ammonia adsorption on the zeolite could be occupied by metal cations which led to negative impact on the adsorption of tn 66 67 meanwhile an increase of the dosage of coagulants would incorporate enhanced amount of flocs that may prevent the adsorption development by blocking the pores of the adsorbent 68 as such the optimal dosages for tn recovery were 20 mg l 1 of pacl and 20 mg l 1 of pfs however the retention of tn did not change much compared with scod and tp within the concentration range of tested coagulants thus the optimal dosages were determined to be 20 mg l 1 of pacl and 150 mg l 1 of pfs along with the consideration of the retentions of scod and tp achieving the retention value of 38 5 in general 20 mg l 1 of pacl and 150 mg l 1 of pfs were preferred in comprehensive consideration of the simultaneous retention of scod tp and tn 3 4 2 adsorbents group rsm as depicted in fig 5b the dosages of zeolite and pac had significant interaction in scod recovery when the dosage of zeolite was fixed pac could be found explicitly positive effect on the retention of scod though pac has poor adsorption capacity of polar substances e g ammonia it reveals good performance on the adsorption of organic matters due to its advantages of large specific surface area wide pore size distribution and hydrophobic surface and its main mechanism of physical adsorption based upon its point of zero charge of ph 9 69 70 while the retention of scod decreased first and then rose up along with growing dosages of zeolite at a fixed dosage of pac meanwhile the retentions of scod at low dosages of zeolite were almost the same as those at high dosages when the dosage of pac was at a low level whereas such values rose at high levels of zeolite with enhanced dosage of pac this demonstrates that the combination of high dosages of zeolite and pac would have interactively positive effect on the retention of scod the negative impact of zeolite on the retention of scod could be compensated by the hybrid positive effect with pac at high dosage levels basically zeolite can adsorb part of fe3 and al3 by ion exchange and reduced their contact and interaction with external environment as a consequence of the wrapping of zeolite by flocs at low dosages 66 68 this could alleviate the electrical neutralization of the coagulants with colloidal and soluble organic matters in raw sewage and hence decreased the retention of scod however the exposure time and exposed area of the zeolite surface would increase with its growing dosage along with the decreasing volume of flocs with the zeolite core 71 this would improve the contact and interaction between zeolite and external substances and promote the electrical neutralization of the coagulants by restricting the hydrolysis of fe3 and al3 through their extra adsorption on the zeolite moreover the increase of exposed area and exposure time of zeolite would enhance the adsorbed amount of soluble organic matters by intensified physical adsorption 70 as such the retention of scod can be improved in this situation with the increasing dosage of pac fe3 al3 and their subsequent hydrolysis products tend to be adsorbed by pac and hence encourage the combination of organic matters and flocs with pac consequently the residual coagulants without consumed by organic matters and pac would be captured by zeolite at high dosage levels and would assist the improvement of the zeolite induced retention of scod in general the optimum adsorbent dosages for scod recovery were 400 mg l 1 of zeolite and 400 mg l 1 of pac with an optimal retention of 77 4 fig 5d shows the interaction between the dosages of zeolite and pac on the retention of tp was not significant the retention of tp decreased as the dosage of pac increased at a fixed dosage of zeolite and did not change much with the increase of the dosage of zeolite at a fixed dosage of pac this can be ascribed to the adsorption of fe3 al3 and their hydrolysates on pac by physical adsorption which would reduce their contact and interaction with phosphate 72 73 the optimal dosages were 50 mg l 1 of zeolite and 50 mg l 1 of pac with a retention of 92 9 considering the tn recovery the interaction between the dosages of zeolite and pac was significant fig 5f the retention of tn decreased as the dosage of pac increased at low dosage levels of zeolite while this downtrend turned to an uptrend at high dosage levels of zeolite as mentioned above the zeolite was wrapped in flocs with a low level dosage and its adsorption capacity of ammonia would be interfered by the ion exchange process with fe3 and al3 meanwhile pac in this situation would have a negative impact on the effect of the coagulation due to its adsorption of fe3 al3 and their hydrolysates with increasing dosages of zeolite the interaction between the surface of zeolite and external environment was promoted in which situation pac encouraged the exposed area and exposure time of zeolite and enhanced the adsorption of ammonia on zeolite such alternation performed the similar trends for dosages of zeolite when the dosage of pac was set at low levels or high levels respectively at a low level dosage of pac the zeolite was wrapped in flocs without enough adsorption capacity of ammonia while the exposed area and exposure time of zeolite would increase with increasing dosage of pac and hence would enhance the zeolite induced adsorption of ammonia this indicates that the adsorbents would have negative hybrid effects on the retention of tn at low dosages and have positive hybrid effects at high dosages as such the optimal dosages for the retention of tn were 400 mg l 1 of zeolite and 400 mg l 1 of pac with an optimal value of 51 4 accordingly for the coagulants group the optimal retentions of scod tp and tn were 68 6 87 8 and 38 5 respectively and for the adsorbents group the optimal retentions of scod tp and tn were 77 4 and 92 9 51 4 respectively above results also support the presumption that the adsorption could improve the retention of scod tp and tn in the ecp and indicate that controlling the dosages of adsorbents would be more effective in process efficiency improvement in the ecp compared to the optimization of the coagulation process 3 5 process variable optimization as for multi objective pre collection though the adsorbents performed well in enhancing the resource recovery in ecp in terms of the scod tp and tn the price of the adsorbents was much greater than the coagulants as such the priority of key parameters and indicators should be different as to achieve balanced effects and cost effectiveness of the ecp process therefore the simultaneous modeling optimization was applied through a set of different combination of target weights of key parameters and indicators including the price of agents and the order of the priority of the pollutants towards minimum consumption of chemicals and maximum resource recovery from raw sewage the numerical set up for optimization of multiple parameters with lower and upper weights and multiple responses with lower and upper limits is listed in table 4 as shown in table 4 the multi objective optimal operating conditions were found as follows 20 mg l 1 of pacl 136 mg l 1 of pfs 50 mg l 1 of zeolite and 236 mg l 1 of pac to verify the reliability of the multi variables and multi responses optimization model three repeated experiments were carried out after slight adjustments to pfs and pac for operational convenience the actual optimal retentions were 69 4 92 9 and 45 0 for scod tp and tn respectively with the minimal process consumption the small errors between the experimental values and predicted values validates the reliability of the multi objective response model along with the accuracy and rationality of the optimization parameters meanwhile the total retention of cod tp and tn reached 89 9 96 0 and 53 1 respectively the organic matter retention higher than direct sewage microfiltration process retention cod 66 1 hybrid coagulation microfiltration process pacl retention cod 71 5 74 ultrafiltration process pac pacl retention cod 89 8 tn 55 0 tp 93 0 75 dynamic membrane retention cod 70 7 76 enhanced membrane based pac pacl retention cod 87 tn 29 tp 88 77 and the effluent after the pre collection by the ecp in optimal conditions met the farmland irrigation water and urban greening water quality standards in china 78 79 revealing the potential of the ecp to achieve quick production of reclaimed water 4 conclusion this study investigated the effect of 10 factors in the multi objective optimized pre collection of sewage resources process pacl pfs zeolite and pac were identified as significant factors affecting the retention efficiency of scod tn and tp through the p b design test the three dimensional surface responses show that the dosage of pfs and pacl had significant interaction in the scod recovery process and the dosage of pac and zeolite in the scod and tn recovery process meanwhile the dosage of pac pfs and zeolite were found to be the most significant factors affecting the retention efficiency of scod tp and tn respectively and the adsorption resulted in higher retention of scod tp and tn retention in the ecp furthermore the optimal dosages were 20 mg l 1 of pacl 136 mg l 1 of pfs 50 mg l 1 of zeolite and 236 mg l 1 of pac obtained by numerical optimization technology which minimized consumption of chemicals and maximizes resource recovery from raw sewage the actual optimized retention of scod tp and tn reached 69 4 92 9 and 45 0 respectively indicating a higher organic matter retention than most sewage pre concentration technologies in general ecp is a promising method that can achieve multi objective pre collection for fast integrated sewage resource recovery credit authorship contribution statement

13022,methods by which resources and energy in wastewater are recycled have been gaining popularity as promising and sustainable ways of wastewater treatment enhanced coagulation process ecp can effectively achieve resources recovery through its synergistic separation of particles colloids and dissolved substances in this study four significant parameters of ecp influencing simultaneous c n and p recovery were obtained through the plackett burman method polyaluminium chloride pacl polyferric sulphate pfs powder activated carbon pac and zeolite considering the demanding connection between multivariate input and output parameters in practical engineering their multi objective parametric interaction and performance were investigated and optimized through the response surface method rsm on the basis of the varied values of retention efficiency specifically pfs and pacl exhibited negative synergistic effects on soluble chemical oxygen demand scod recovery while their interaction on the retention of total phosphorous tp and total nitrogen tn were not significant meanwhile pac and zeolite had positive synergistic effects on the retention of scod and on the tn recovery at high dosages and revealed negative synergistic effects on the retention of tn at low dosages however their interaction on tp recovery was insignificant according to obtained rsm model the optimized parametric conditions were 20 mg l 1 of pacl 136 mg l 1 of pfs 50 mg l 1 of zeolite and 236 mg l 1 of pac achieving the actual maximum values of 69 4 92 9 and 45 0 for the collaborative retention of scod tp and tn respectively this suggests the promising performance of ecp in multi objective pre collection for fast integrated sewage resource recovery keywords sewage resource recovery enhanced coagulation process ecp multi objective optimization response surface methodology rsm plackett burman method pb sustainability 1 introduction municipal wastewater or sewage originated from domestic sewer systems and it is no longer considered liquid waste but an economically sustainable resource although the traditional activated sludge process has stable treatment effect and good effluent quality and now occupies a huge share of the wastewater treatment market it is insufficient for efficient energy utilization and nutrient recovery to achieve carbon neutralization 1 3 under the circumstances of severe water shortage and global noticeable fossil fuel energy crisis meeting the standards of sewage treatment or reducing the cost of sewage treatment are no longer the primary objectives in sewage treatment 2 due to a level of approximately 60 of the total energy consumption caused by aeration in the activated sludge process and the difficulties in recycling n and p the process does not meet the requirements of sustainable treatment methods 4 5 currently considerable attention has been paid to recycling valuable products and energy and full material recovery is a notable sustainable research and development direction it is generally recognized that widely used conventional activated sludge treatments are unable to achieve adequate energy and resource recovery while the anaerobic digestion ad is a promising sustainable alternative which directly convert c n and p to sustainable resources rather than consume them however the low concentration of these substances is considered to be one of the major bottlenecks of the direct anaerobic treatment of domestic sewage 4 therefore in this context we aim to improve the recyclability of c n p within the same system in recent studies sewage pre concentration coupling with ad has been reported as an unconventional yet promising technology which aims to retain raw sewage organic materials and nutrients in a simplified and cost effective way the pre concentration of raw sewage can increase the efficiency of wastewater conversion to energy and decrease the costs of subsequent processing 6 current pre concentration technologies include bio flocculation membrane filtration conventional physicochemical methods or a combination thereof 6 9 the advantages of each method can be hampered by insufficient carbon conservation and concentration rates 1 10 elevated chemicals consumption and operational costs 11 13 and or limited separation of soluble organics 14 16 however the pre concentration process still needs to be optimized to realize efficient energy and resource recovery the conventional physicochemical method is inexpensive and its potential is still under investigation precipitation as one of the most widely used yet inefficient in the present 5 17 can be a notably cost effective method under optimization to achieve fast full material recovery the conventional sedimentation process separates the pollutants from the sewage by their own gravity or buoyancy but only suspended solids can be removed without colloidal and soluble pollutants 18 19 principledly the removal of colloidal and soluble pollutants can be improved by electric neutralization and adhesion to a surface namely coagulation and adsorption 20 23 nevertheless the conventional application of single coagulation or adsorption process in the pre treatment stage reveals limited separation efficiency and is insufficient for full material recovery 24 as such a combination of them was proposed as an enhanced coagulation process ecp in our previous studies to cope with the limitations of separation especially for the improvement of recovery efficiency of soluble components separation efficiency of solid liquid matters and the reduction of the dosages of reagents and this combined method can be critical for effective concentration of target recoverable pollutants 25 26 specifically there are many parameters that affect the ecp including the type of reagents mixing conditions coagulation times stirring speed etc 27 simultaneous interactive effects among the independent variables cannot be explained clearly using changing one factor at a time method which affects the prediction and evaluation of the optimal ecp parameters response surface method rsm as a statistical method to solve multivariate problems uses multiple quadratic regression equations to fit the functional relationship between factors and response values and finds optimal process parameters through the analysis of regression equations organic and nutrient pre concentration can be effectively optimized through rsm which helps to illustrate the interactive effects among tested variables 28 based upon previous application of the ecp in micro polluted water treatment 29 at present few research if any has been found on the sole use of the ecp for completing the pre concentration of domestic sewage as such the ecp was redesigned and optimized through rsm in this study to achieve effective c n p recovery for synchronized sewage pre concentration in domestic sewage in this study the plackett burman p b experiment was conducted focusing on 10 reported parameters that extensively influence the ecp four significant parameters were selected and brought to subsequent rsm using box behnken design bbd model where different levels of such four variables were identified and optimized for guiding the selection of practically optimal experimental conditions finally the maximum recovery of organic matters and nutrients under actual conditions was obtained and related interactions were explained 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw sewage characteristics raw sewage was collected from the xiao jiahe wastewater treatment plant in beijing china the characteristics of the raw sewage were given in the table s1 within the testing period the raw sewages had an average chemical oxygen demand cod of 226 6 46 5 mg l 1 total nitrogen tn of 57 5 10 5 mg l 1 and total phosphorus tp of 5 9 1 7 mg l 1 the cod concentration was less than the average influent concentration of conventional urban sewage treatment plants in china 30 while tn and tp were higher 2 2 stirring setup a zr4 4 model 4 paddle jar tester zhongrun water industry technology development co ltd from shenzhen china with several cylindrical 600 ml mixing beakers was set up for all precipitation and separation tests at the xiao jiahe wastewater treatment plant the mixing speed in step stirring mode varied from 10 to 1000 rpm which corresponds to a mixing velocity gradient g value range of 10 1000 s 1 2 3 analytical methods the cod soluble cod scod tn and tp were all tested according to the chinese national environmental protection agency standard methods 31 the sample was filtered with paper and membrane filters with a nominal pore size of 0 45 μm to eliminate particulate and colloidal cod respectively and the permeate of membrane filter was tested for scod above procedures referred to the method described by faust to explore detailed mass distribution during pre collection by the ecp 32 same procedures were brought out for determining particulate colloidal and soluble tp and tn respectively detailed fractionation was also implemented to evaluate the efficiency of resource retention according to van nieuwenhuijzen s method 33 2 4 experimental design and analysis 2 4 1 plackett burman experiment for the actual pre collection of resources in sewage it is difficult to empirically examine the influence of all process variables on the response variables so it is important to select appropriate process variables directly related to the construction of the accurate optimization model obviously the key parameters that determine the performance of multi objective sewage pre collection are yet to be explored the p b experiment design is a screening test focusing on the selection of the number and the undetermined influence of the factors on the response variables which can avoid the waste of test resources in later optimization experiments by preventing the evaluation of insignificant factors it is a two factorial i e 1 and 1 design locating significant variables for the production by screening n variables in n 1 experiments 34 the aim of p b design in this study was to identify the most impactful and cost effective parameters of the ecp on maximizing the collaborative pre collection of organic matter and nutrients in sewage with scod tp and tn retention as key indicators the empirical fundamental processes of ecp for multi objective collaborative resource pre collection include stirring coagulation and adsorption the mixing process in stirring affects coagulation by impacting the concentration of particles and water conservancy conditions 35 as such the velocity gradient x1 mixing time x2 and settling time x3 are selected as three main considered factors of stirring for p b design 36 37 as for coagulation and adsorption the type and dosage of reagents determine their performance and applicability indicating that polyaluminium chloride pacl x5 polyferric sulphate pfs x6 carboxymethyl cellulose cmc x7 and polyacrylamide pam x8 were tested for coagulation process 38 with zeolite x10 clay minerals and powder activated carbon pac x11 for adsorption process 39 all above variables were examined their significance on multi targets recovery through p b design it is also worth noting that the impact of ph was excluded in p b test due to the stable value of 7 8 in raw sewage in this study considering its few impacts on the recovery efficiency of ecp moreover adjusting ph is not common in practical operation of a wastewater treatment plant for its severe economic burden in general 11 factors x4 as the dummy variable were tested and compared for multi objective selection of key parameters at high and low levels in the p b design as shown in table s2 the schematic diagram of the ecp is shown in fig 1 the stirring process was conducted with 200 ml of raw sewage in the beakers according to the parameters set up of p b design and the concentrations of scod tp and tn sampling from 2 cm below the water surface before and after ecp were tested for the calculation of their retention the retention calculation is presented in eq 1 12 1 r c r c s c r 100 where r is the retention value and c r and c s represent the concentration of the raw sewage and supernatant after ecp respectively 2 4 2 response surface method rsm and box behnken design bbd the rsm is effective for optimizing chemical reactions and industrial processes and usually used for experimental designs 40 it can explore the interaction between multiple factors on response values through a small number of experiments and subsequently identify a set of operational conditions that are able to maximize targeted response or at the minimum maintain desirable ranges 41 42 in this study the rsm was used to assess the relationship between responses scod tp and tn retention and independent variables along with optimal response estimation by optimizing the values of key factors basically central composite design ccd and bbd are two most common used fitting models in rsm 43 however bbd outperforms ccd in this study due to its selection of centre points of factor which can avoid experiments under extreme conditions and subsequent significant test errors compared to the combination of all factors at highest level in ccd 44 45 the program of bbd was proposed by the design expert version 11 0 each of four independent variables selected from p b design tests was varied over three levels coded as 1 0 and 1 which investigate their impacts on the multi objective retention of scod tn and tp from raw sewage 46 the number of experiments n for independent variables was calculated using eq 2 47 2 n k 2 k c p where k is the number of factors k 3 cp represents the number of the central points cp 6 that can evaluate the pure error of thirty experiments considering three levels for each factor the appropriate model is selected as the quadratic model eq 3 48 3 y β 0 β i x i β ii x i 2 β ij x i x j where y is the predicted response x i and x j represents coded independent variables β 0 β i β ii β ij represents the offset term the ith linear coefficient the ith quadratic coefficient and the ijth interaction coefficient respectively the main indicators that demonstrate the significance and adequacy of the used model include the correlation coefficient r2 the model f value fisher variation ratio p value probability and adequate precision ap 49 50 2 4 3 multi objective numerical optimization the hill climbing algorithm was used for multi objective numerical optimization in addition to the design points a set of random points were checked to determine whether a more desirable solution exists 51 to find an initial feasible region the nelder mead multi dimensional pattern was used where the minimum or maximum of an objective function is directly searched in a multidimensional space through four basic procedures reflection expansion contraction and shrinkage 52 54 detailed procedures are as following 1 let x a vector of x i for i 1 n represent design variables over the optimization space which is a subset of the design space 2 let y j u j l j for j 1 m be responses with upper and or lower bounds serving as constraints 3 let y x be the response to be optimized then f x y x for minimization f x y x for maximization define the constraints as a series of discontinuous functions 4 g j x y j x u j for y j u j 5 g j x 0 for l j y j u j 6 g j x l j y j x for y j l j so this produces a system of m constraints that can be solved as an unconstrained problem via a penalty function eq 7 approach when the optimization begins in an undesirable location 7 minimize f x p j g j x where p is a penalty parameter 0 for j 1 to m the penalty parameter p starts at 1 and increases with each iteration by a factor of 100 and the number of iterations is limited to 15 which gives a penalty factor of 1030 maximum 3 result and discussion 3 1 raw sewage characterization the fractionation of the cod tn and tp concentrations of the raw sewage were described in fig 2 the percentage of particulate and colloidal cod 0 45 μm that is the easily recoverable organic part by the common coagulation process was greater than scod with a value of 64 7 while the soluble fraction whose molecular weight less than 1 kda comprised around 29 of total cod different from the situation of cod the easily recoverable part of tn and tp only comprised 8 4 and 26 5 respectively which was similar to the previous study 55 as such most resources in sewage would not be preferable for effective collection through normal separation processes in wastewater treatment therefore it is necessary to adapt the ecp to improve the retention of soluble fraction of cod tn and tp as to maximize the sewage resources recovery 3 2 plackett burman p b design as mentioned above the collection of the soluble fraction must be improved for maximizing organic recovery scod tn tp are selected as response variables in p b design considering the fact that scod only comprised around 29 of total cod while the majority of tn and tp are soluble fraction the results of retentions of scod tn and tp in p b design are listed in table 1 it is clear that the retention of scod tn and tp for 12 tests ranged between 36 and 57 30 43 89 98 2 respectively the retentions of tn were lower than that of cod and tp showing that effective retention of nitrogen through physical chemical processes remains difficult on account of positively charged soluble nitrogen that cannot be coagulated or adsorbed and be separated though the soluble fraction comprised around 73 5 of tp the retention of tp could surpass 90 which was more than the average removal efficiency of secondary biological treatment 56 57 this indicates that the p with molecular weight less than 1 kda was effectively recovered by the physical chemical processes meanwhile the retention of scod was greater than that in the previous study 58 which can be attributed to the addition of multiple adsorbents considering that the nitrogen compounds have minimal retention efficiency among all pollutants the retention rates of tp and scod were mainly considered in the selection of significant parameters an analysis of variance anova of p b design was shown in fig 3a the p value in fig 3a represents the probability of the difference between samples caused by sampling errors 59 specifically the p values of mixing time settling time and the dose of pacl pfs diatomite zeolite and pac were less than 0 05 indicating their significant impacts on the response value and statistical significance 60 to further filter significant factors that simplify rsm experiments the absolute values of the standardized effect were quantitatively compared in fig 3b as mentioned above factors notably influencing scod and tp retention were especially discussed in this section considering the impacts of adsorbents zeolite and pac rather than diatomite revealed significant effects on the retention of scod with standardized effect values of 0 0105 and 0 0297 respectively meanwhile only zeolite performed a significant factor of the retention of tp with a standardized effect value of 0 0107 therefore zeolite and pac were identified significant adsorbents proper for subsequent rsm experiments when it comes to coagulants only pacl substantially affected the retention of scod with a standardized effect value of 0 0129 whereas both pacl and pfs exhibited significance on the retention of tp with large standardized effect values of 0 0278 and 0 0435 respectively as such pacl and pfs could be selected as significant coagulants among mixing conditions settling time was the most influential factor on the retention of scod and tp while its standardized effect value was less than 0 01 indicating a minor impact in general pac substantially impacted the retention of scod which is important for improving anaerobic digestion energy recovery pfs notably influenced the retention of tp which is the important non renewable energy sources pacl and zeolite significantly affected the retention of both scod and tp therefore pacl pfs zeolite and pac were selected as four preferred significant factors for bbd optimization 3 3 bbd pacl pfs zeolite and pac were set at three levels for multi objective resource recovery tests in bbd design table s3 as such a total of 30 batches of experiments including 6 central points were carried out and 3 samples were taken in each experiment for parallel measurement all experiments set up and corresponding results are listed in table 2 the variables and responses were analysed through multiple regression analysis and evaluated the reliability of the model by anova table 3 which explains the retention performance of scod tp and tn in the ecp process the final second order polynomial models obtained from coding factors are as follows 8 y 1 65 14 0 95 x 1 2 38 x 2 1 59 x 3 10 33 x 4 3 70 x 1 x 2 0 65 x 1 x 3 1 29 x 1 x 4 1 09 x 2 x 3 2 42 x 2 x 4 1 44 x 3 x 4 0 042 x 1 2 1 75 x 2 2 2 75 x 3 2 5 90 x 4 2 9 y 2 86 89 5 71 x 1 14 18 x 2 0

2 3 94 x 1 x 3 0 48 x 1 x 4 0 35 x 2 x 3 3 47 x 2 x 4 5 90 x 3 x 4 where y 1 y 2 and y 3 represent the retention of scod tp and tn respectively x 1 x 2 x 3 and x 4 represent the dosages of pacl pfs zeolite and pac respectively the p values of eqs 8 9 and 10 were all less than 0 05 indicating that the fitting curves in the model between each factor and response were significant within the 95 confidence interval level 60 the coefficient of determination r2 implies that 91 07 96 45 and 86 29 of the variation in response could be explained by given variables and the fitting model revealed enough explanatory power in reflecting the true relationship between selected factors 61 moreover the values of r2 adj r2 adj 0 8273 0 9314 and 0 6382 for eqs 8 9 10 respectively were found in reasonable agreement with the r2 pred r2 pred 0 6456 0 8210 and 0 8210 for eqs 8 9 10 respectively considering the fact that their difference was less than 0 2 therefore it can be considered that no other factors have a significant influence on the response variable except the given factors 62 in addition the coefficients of variation cv of eqs 8 9 and 10 were 5 48 3 98 and 7 79 which were all less than 10 and the adequate precision ap were 11 530 19 939 and 11 805 which were much greater than 4 demonstrating that the signal of the model was adequate 60 fig 4 shows the difference between the predicted values of the fitted model and the actual values of the retention of scod tp and tn respectively all data points were distributed close to the reference line actual value predicted value meanwhile the normality of the residuals of the fitted model was also calculated to quantitatively evaluate the reliability of the model as shown in fig s1 the residual normal distribution data points of the three fitting models showed a linear well fitted trend as such the residuals followed a normal distribution and the fitting model extracted all the regularity information in the data 62 in general the second order polynomial model was reliable in describing the retention of scod tp and tn in the ecp process 3 4 rsm the plots of three dimensional 3d surface responses were developed by the software through multiple quadratic regression equations as shown in fig 5 to comprehensively investigate the individual and interactive effects of the independent variables on the retentions of scod tp and tn considering that there were more than two influencing factors in the response model the types of the factors were divided into the coagulants group include pacl and pfs and the adsorbents group include zeolite and pac the 3d response surface contour plots were accordingly displayed within one group range by keeping the other group at a constant level centre level with details shown in fig 5a b c d e and f principally the interaction between the two factors in a contour plot is not significant when the contour line reveals like a circular contour shape while if the contour line is more like an ellipse and has a large curvature there is a significant interaction between the two factors 63 3 4 1 coagulants group rsm as shown in fig 5a the dosages of pfs and pacl had significant interaction in the recovery of scod the retention of scod rose with the increase of the dosage of pacl when the dosage of pfs was constant and at a low level 20 mg l 1 while the rising tendency transformed into a downward trend with the increase of the dosage of pfs the trend of pfs was similar when the dosage of pacl was constant while the diversity of the retention of scod caused by pfs was greater than that of pacl this can be ascribed to the charge imbalance and floc destabilization caused by the excessive dosage of the coagulant 64 65 as such the optimal coagulant dosages of pacl and pfs were 20 mg l 1 and 150 mg l 1 achieving the optimal scod recovery rate of 68 6 considering the tp recovery shown in fig 5c the interaction between pfs and pacl dosage was not significant the retention of tp increased with the rise of the dosage of pacl with a specified dosage of pfs while the uptrend gradually moderated with enhanced dosage of pfs basically pfs prefers to coagulate with p compounds in sewage compared to the pacl as such pacl played a limited role in achieving effective coagulation with p compounds with the presence of pfs which can be attributed to the much less value of the solubility product constant of fepo4 ksp 1 3 10 22 than that of alpo4 ksp 6 3 10 19 on the other hand the retention of tp was improved with increasing dosages of pfs along with a specified dosage of pacl however the values of those were almost the same under different dosages of pacl with a pfs dosage of 150 mg l 1 which also supported above mechanism therefore the optimal dosages were 20 mg l 1 of pacl and 150 mg l 1 of pfs based on the response surface and the optimal tp recovery reaches 87 8 fig 5e shows that the interaction between the dosages of pfs and pacl was not significant in the retention of tn whichever the dosage of pfs or pacl was constant the retention of tn declined with the increase of the dosage of the other coagulant this implies that pfs and pacl had negative effect on the tn recovery this corresponds to the phenomenon that the sites of ammonia adsorption on the zeolite could be occupied by metal cations which led to negative impact on the adsorption of tn 66 67 meanwhile an increase of the dosage of coagulants would incorporate enhanced amount of flocs that may prevent the adsorption development by blocking the pores of the adsorbent 68 as such the optimal dosages for tn recovery were 20 mg l 1 of pacl and 20 mg l 1 of pfs however the retention of tn did not change much compared with scod and tp within the concentration range of tested coagulants thus the optimal dosages were determined to be 20 mg l 1 of pacl and 150 mg l 1 of pfs along with the consideration of the retentions of scod and tp achieving the retention value of 38 5 in general 20 mg l 1 of pacl and 150 mg l 1 of pfs were preferred in comprehensive consideration of the simultaneous retention of scod tp and tn 3 4 2 adsorbents group rsm as depicted in fig 5b the dosages of zeolite and pac had significant interaction in scod recovery when the dosage of zeolite was fixed pac could be found explicitly positive effect on the retention of scod though pac has poor adsorption capacity of polar substances e g ammonia it reveals good performance on the adsorption of organic matters due to its advantages of large specific surface area wide pore size distribution and hydrophobic surface and its main mechanism of physical adsorption based upon its point of zero charge of ph 9 69 70 while the retention of scod decreased first and then rose up along with growing dosages of zeolite at a fixed dosage of pac meanwhile the retentions of scod at low dosages of zeolite were almost the same as those at high dosages when the dosage of pac was at a low level whereas such values rose at high levels of zeolite with enhanced dosage of pac this demonstrates that the combination of high dosages of zeolite and pac would have interactively positive effect on the retention of scod the negative impact of zeolite on the retention of scod could be compensated by the hybrid positive effect with pac at high dosage levels basically zeolite can adsorb part of fe3 and al3 by ion exchange and reduced their contact and interaction with external environment as a consequence of the wrapping of zeolite by flocs at low dosages 66 68 this could alleviate the electrical neutralization of the coagulants with colloidal and soluble organic matters in raw sewage and hence decreased the retention of scod however the exposure time and exposed area of the zeolite surface would increase with its growing dosage along with the decreasing volume of flocs with the zeolite core 71 this would improve the contact and interaction between zeolite and external substances and promote the electrical neutralization of the coagulants by restricting the hydrolysis of fe3 and al3 through their extra adsorption on the zeolite moreover the increase of exposed area and exposure time of zeolite would enhance the adsorbed amount of soluble organic matters by intensified physical adsorption 70 as such the retention of scod can be improved in this situation with the increasing dosage of pac fe3 al3 and their subsequent hydrolysis products tend to be adsorbed by pac and hence encourage the combination of organic matters and flocs with pac consequently the residual coagulants without consumed by organic matters and pac would be captured by zeolite at high dosage levels and would assist the improvement of the zeolite induced retention of scod in general the optimum adsorbent dosages for scod recovery were 400 mg l 1 of zeolite and 400 mg l 1 of pac with an optimal retention of 77 4 fig 5d shows the interaction between the dosages of zeolite and pac on the retention of tp was not significant the retention of tp decreased as the dosage of pac increased at a fixed dosage of zeolite and did not change much with the increase of the dosage of zeolite at a fixed dosage of pac this can be ascribed to the adsorption of fe3 al3 and their hydrolysates on pac by physical adsorption which would reduce their contact and interaction with phosphate 72 73 the optimal dosages were 50 mg l 1 of zeolite and 50 mg l 1 of pac with a retention of 92 9 considering the tn recovery the interaction between the dosages of zeolite and pac was significant fig 5f the retention of tn decreased as the dosage of pac increased at low dosage levels of zeolite while this downtrend turned to an uptrend at high dosage levels of zeolite as mentioned above the zeolite was wrapped in flocs with a low level dosage and its adsorption capacity of ammonia would be interfered by the ion exchange process with fe3 and al3 meanwhile pac in this situation would have a negative impact on the effect of the coagulation due to its adsorption of fe3 al3 and their hydrolysates with increasing dosages of zeolite the interaction between the surface of zeolite and external environment was promoted in which situation pac encouraged the exposed area and exposure time of zeolite and enhanced the adsorption of ammonia on zeolite such alternation performed the similar trends for dosages of zeolite when the dosage of pac was set at low levels or high levels respectively at a low level dosage of pac the zeolite was wrapped in flocs without enough adsorption capacity of ammonia while the exposed area and exposure time of zeolite would increase with increasing dosage of pac and hence would enhance the zeolite induced adsorption of ammonia this indicates that the adsorbents would have negative hybrid effects on the retention of tn at low dosages and have positive hybrid effects at high dosages as such the optimal dosages for the retention of tn were 400 mg l 1 of zeolite and 400 mg l 1 of pac with an optimal value of 51 4 accordingly for the coagulants group the optimal retentions of scod tp and tn were 68 6 87 8 and 38 5 respectively and for the adsorbents group the optimal retentions of scod tp and tn were 77 4 and 92 9 51 4 respectively above results also support the presumption that the adsorption could improve the retention of scod tp and tn in the ecp and indicate that controlling the dosages of adsorbents would be more effective in process efficiency improvement in the ecp compared to the optimization of the coagulation process 3 5 process variable optimization as for multi objective pre collection though the adsorbents performed well in enhancing the resource recovery in ecp in terms of the scod tp and tn the price of the adsorbents was much greater than the coagulants as such the priority of key parameters and indicators should be different as to achieve balanced effects and cost effectiveness of the ecp process therefore the simultaneous modeling optimization was applied through a set of different combination of target weights of key parameters and indicators including the price of agents and the order of the priority of the pollutants towards minimum consumption of chemicals and maximum resource recovery from raw sewage the numerical set up for optimization of multiple parameters with lower and upper weights and multiple responses with lower and upper limits is listed in table 4 as shown in table 4 the multi objective optimal operating conditions were found as follows 20 mg l 1 of pacl 136 mg l 1 of pfs 50 mg l 1 of zeolite and 236 mg l 1 of pac to verify the reliability of the multi variables and multi responses optimization model three repeated experiments were carried out after slight adjustments to pfs and pac for operational convenience the actual optimal retentions were 69 4 92 9 and 45 0 for scod tp and tn respectively with the minimal process consumption the small errors between the experimental values and predicted values validates the reliability of the multi objective response model along with the accuracy and rationality of the optimization parameters meanwhile the total retention of cod tp and tn reached 89 9 96 0 and 53 1 respectively the organic matter retention higher than direct sewage microfiltration process retention cod 66 1 hybrid coagulation microfiltration process pacl retention cod 71 5 74 ultrafiltration process pac pacl retention cod 89 8 tn 55 0 tp 93 0 75 dynamic membrane retention cod 70 7 76 enhanced membrane based pac pacl retention cod 87 tn 29 tp 88 77 and the effluent after the pre collection by the ecp in optimal conditions met the farmland irrigation water and urban greening water quality standards in china 78 79 revealing the potential of the ecp to achieve quick production of reclaimed water 4 conclusion this study investigated the effect of 10 factors in the multi objective optimized pre collection of sewage resources process pacl pfs zeolite and pac were identified as significant factors affecting the retention efficiency of scod tn and tp through the p b design test the three dimensional surface responses show that the dosage of pfs and pacl had significant interaction in the scod recovery process and the dosage of pac and zeolite in the scod and tn recovery process meanwhile the dosage of pac pfs and zeolite were found to be the most significant factors affecting the retention efficiency of scod tp and tn respectively and the adsorption resulted in higher retention of scod tp and tn retention in the ecp furthermore the optimal dosages were 20 mg l 1 of pacl 136 mg l 1 of pfs 50 mg l 1 of zeolite and 236 mg l 1 of pac obtained by numerical optimization technology which minimized consumption of chemicals and maximizes resource recovery from raw sewage the actual optimized retention of scod tp and tn reached 69 4 92 9 and 45 0 respectively indicating a higher organic matter retention than most sewage pre concentration technologies in general ecp is a promising method that can achieve multi objective pre collection for fast integrated sewage resource recovery credit authorship contribution statement

13023,aquaculture effluent contributes to surface water pollution coagulation flocculation and sedimentation are currently the best practices in aquaculture effluent treatment and the utilization of chemical coagulants or flocculants is still dominant in assisting the treatment processes this research aimed to analyze the potential of the bacteria based bioflocculant produced by serratia marcescens in treating real aquaculture effluent s marcescens was cultivated for 24 h inside tryptic soy broth medium and the produced bioflocculant was used in raw condition without extraction jar test and one variable at a time method were used to assess the effect of bioflocculant dosage and its performance was compared with that of alum a commonly used coagulant the bioflocculant produced by s marcescens worked well with the assistance of cacl2 the 10 bioflocculant dosage showed a remarkable removal of turbidity and suspended solid 83 95 and 78 82 respectively compared with the control 80 98 and 76 99 respectively increasing the bioflocculant dosage had a negative effect on color removal because the bioflocculant solution had a reddish color as a result of prodigiosin secretion by s marcescens zeta potential particle size distribution and microscopic analyses revealed that flocculation occurred via the bridging mechanism the utilization of cacl2 bioflocculant showed notable performances in turbidity and suspended solid removal compared with the control reactor while exhibiting a similar efficiency as alum p 0 05 bioflocculant extraction is suggested to be conducted in future research to eliminate its negative effect on the color parameter graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aquaculture biocoagulant cultivation environmental pollution fish wastewater treatment 1 introduction aquaculture is one of the industries that contribute greatly to surface water pollution 1 2 aquaculture effluent has high organic content high turbidity high suspended solid ss contents and a specific color 3 5 nonetheless aquaculture effluent also contains high nutrient levels in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus 6 8 ahmad et al 9 mentioned that freshwater aquaculture has a turbidity of 307 ntu a ss content of 427 mg l an ammonia content of 24 5 mg l a nitrate content of 11 9 mg l a phosphate content of 0 07 mg l and a chemical oxygen demand cod of 120 3 mg l similarly huang et al 10 also stated the contents of ammonium 2 35 mg l nitrate 0 51 mg l nitrite 0 13 mg l phosphorus 0 23 mg l and cod 66 6 mg l in fresh water aquaculture effluent nitrogen and phosphorus in aquaculture effluent originate from the utilization of fertilizer to maintain algal growth on multiculture and biofloc cultivation systems 11 13 these components may contribute to the eutrophication phenomenon if discharged to water bodies without any proper treatment 14 16 the current best practices in aquaculture treatment are coagulation flocculation and sedimentation 17 19 these methods are proven effective in treating most parameters in an aquaculture effluent heiderscheidt et al 20 exhibited the high performance of polyaluminium chloride in removing up to 98 of the turbidity ss and phosphate from an aquaculture effluent in addition gibson et al 18 also showed the successful treatment of ss from aquaculture effluent using polyacrylamide polymers the application of coagulation flocculation and sedimentation cannot be separated from coagulants and flocculants 21 22 the most widely used coagulant is alum alum exhibits great performance in removing turbidity and ss parameter from aquaculture effluent up to 98 20 23 despite their great efficiency the utilization of metal based coagulants in treating wastewater has received much concern such concerns include the change in aquatic ph stability and the production of nonbiodegradable sludge on top of the original ss existing in wastewater 24 26 the utilization of biocoagulants and bioflocculants shows a promising solution to overcome these emerging issues 27 biocoagulants and bioflocculants comprise plant materials bacteria microalgae and animal based compounds 28 endut et al 29 exhibited the performance of moringa oleifera derivates in removing ss from aquaculture effluent hamid et al 30 also addressed the potential of m oleifera as a bioflocculant in recovering algae from aquaculture effluent with recovery value up to 92 in addition yunos et al 31 also reported the suitability of using chitosan to recover macroalgae from aquaculture effluent with a recovery value of 80 the current development of bioflocculants has focused on plant and animal based compounds whereas study on bacteria based bioflocculants is still scarce moreover the application of bioflocculants in treating real aquaculture effluent is also limited 32 therefore this study aimed to unlock the potential of the bioflocculant produced by a bacteria species serratia marcescens in treating real aquaculture effluent and compare its performance to that of alum a commonly used coagulant s marcescens is a gram negative bacterium that can be found naturally in soil or water and is often associated with urinary respiratory and wound infections 33 despite of its nature and associated diseases this bacterium is capable of producing biosurfactants and degrading hydrocarbon compounds 34 35 however analyses on its extracellular polymeric substances epss as bioflocculants are rare 22 the utilization of this bacterium in water treatment as well as its association with several diseases is possibly because its epss do not contain any genetic materials 36 38 the good performance of bioflocculants was highlighted in this study as the combination of cacl2 and bioflocculant showed no remarkable difference in pollutant removal compared with alum the utilization of bioflocculants can produce sludge with greater biodegradability compared with alum which still needs to be further assessed in future research the presented results are expected to give new insight into the treatment of aquaculture effluent using environment friendly technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 source and characteristics of aquaculture effluent aquaculture effluent was obtained from a freshwater catfish cultivation in labu negeri sembilan malaysia samples were transferred from the sampling location to a laboratory in universiti kebangsaan malaysia for characterization the characteristics of the aquaculture effluent are tabulated in table 1 the contents of ss cod ammoniacal nitrogen and color in the effluent are above the standard limits 41 compared with values in other countries the tested ph for all data were still within the normal range cod nitrogen and phosphorus contents were also mentioned by other researchers 5 39 40 indicating that aquaculture effluent contains organic compounds and nutrients which need to be treated before the effluent can be discharged to water bodies 2 2 s marcescens culture s marcescens was isolated from the aquaculture effluent in semenyih malaysia this species is a gram negative bacterium that produces a red colored pigment called prodigiosin at room temperature 35 42 this isolated bacterial species was previously screened and showed the highest potential in producing bioflocculants for artificial turbid water 2 3 s marcescens growth and growth kinetics s marcescens growth was assessed to obtain the exponential phase of the isolate all testing stages were conducted using od600nm 1 a 43 the produced growth rate curve was used as the basis of incubation time to obtain od600nm 1 a before proceeding to the next stage a 1 ml of od600nm 1 a inoculum of s marcescens was introduced into 99 ml of sterile tryptic soy broth tsb bacto usa inside a 250 ml conical flask iwaki germany 44 tsb medium containing s marcescens inoculum was shaken for 24 h on 150 rpm inside a 37 c incubator shaker protech malaysia and optical density od reading was carried out hourly until 12 h and then once again at 24 h using uv vis spectrophotometer hach usa with a 600 nm wavelength 45 46 the growth curve was created by plotting the measured od versus time 47 the specific growth rate of s marcescens was calculated based on the measured od during the exponential phase following eq 1 48 49 1 μx dx dt where μ is the specific growth rate 1 h x is the optical density a and t is the time h 2 4 production of bioflocculant a 1 ml of s marcescens with od600nm 1a was inoculated into 99 ml of sterile tsb then shaken for 24 h at 150 rpm inside a 37 c incubator shaker 44 the bioflocculant produced by the bacteria was released into the growing medium as an eps 50 51 after 24 h of shaking the bacterial cell was separated with its medium by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min eppendorf germany 50 cell free supernatant containing the eps of s marcescens was used as the bioflocculant solution under raw condition without extraction from medium the bioflocculant was extracted from the growing medium by following the protocol given by hasan et al 50 for characterization the extracted dry bioflocculant was subjected to fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy for functional group analysis and zeta ζ potential was checked under ph 6 7 and 8 52 referring to the neutral ph range of aquaculture effluent summarized in table 1 2 5 analysis of optimum bioflocculant dosage optimum biocoagulant dosage was analyzed using one variable at a time ovat analysis different dosages 1 2 3 5 and 10 v v of the eps assisted by 2 3 volume of cacl2 acted as coagulant 50 53 were analyzed to determine their performance as bioflocculants a total volume of 300 ml aquaculture effluent cacl2 and bioflocculant was run inside a 500 ml beaker glass control reactors were made by substituting the bioflocculant volume with sterile tsb to compare with the performance of the bioflocculant the eps produced by the bacteria worked better as a bioflocculant than as a biocoagulant in which the application of eps need to be accompanied by a coagulant biocoagulant 54 55 turbidity removal was made by deducting the initial value with the final value of the tested parameter turbidity ss and color coagulation flocculation and sedimentation processes were run using a jar test set up with the following operational parameters rapid mixing at 150 rpm for 2 min slow mixing at 20 rpm for 10 min and sedimentation for 30 min 23 2 6 comparison of bioflocculant performance and mechanism determination a comparison of bioflocculant performances was performed by running jar test under different operational parameters using only aquaculture effluent only cacl2 only bioflocculant cacl2 bioflocculant and alum 29 the dosages of the different coagulants and flocculants used were determined from the optimum dosage obtained in the previous stage the same operational parameters for coagulation flocculation and sedimentation i e rapid mixing at 150 rpm for 2 min slow mixing at 20 rpm for 10 min and sedimentation for 30 min were applied in all jar experiments performances were compared in terms of turbidity ss and color removal percentages differences in sludge formation were also compared under 100 magnification using a microscope nikon eclipse e100 japan the mechanism was determined using ζ potential and particle size distribution analyses with a zetasizer malvern instrument uk 3 results and discussion 3 1 s marcescens growth and specific growth rate the growth curve of s marcescens is presented in fig 1 based on fig 1 the exponential phase of s marcescens was obtained within 5 7 h of incubation whereas the od600nm 1 a was obtained after 15 h of incubation according to these results s marcescens should be pregrown for a minimum incubation time of 15 h prior to use this finding was similar to that of jeffrey et al 56 who showed that the exponential phase of s marcescens is at 4 8 h of incubation and od600nm 1 a is obtained after 15 h of incubation the calculation of specific growth rate was conducted based on the exponential phase of s marcescens following eq 1 the specific growth rate of s marcescens was calculated as 0 2558 h 3 2 analysis of optimum bioflocculant dosage the results of parameter removal in different bioflocculant dosages are presented in fig 2 in terms of turbidity the control reactor showed an 80 98 removal of turbidity whereas the addition of bioflocculant in 10 dosage showed the highest removal of 83 95 the wastewater used had a turbid characteristic owing to the high level of ss particles discrete particles which are easily settled by gravity 57 the addition of different bioflocculant dosages did not remarkably increase the turbidity removal a substantial difference in removal was obtained between the control and the addition of 10 bioflocculant thus 10 dosage was chosen for the performance comparison a similar trend was obtained for ss ss is considered the major contributor to the turbidity of wastewater the control reactor showed 76 99 ss removal whereas the addition of bioflocculant in 10 dosage increased the ss removal up to 78 82 ss particles have a high molecular weight thus these particles can settle gravitationally no remarkable difference in ss removal was obtained under the different dosages but a substantial difference in ss removal was found between the control and the addition of 10 bioflocculant similar to the obtained trend on turbidity different trends were obtained in terms of color the control reactor showed a color removal of up to 61 52 whereas the addition of 10 bioflocculant decreased the color removal to 59 80 the highest color removal was obtained through the addition of 1 bioflocculant 62 42 this result indicates that increasing the bioflocculant dosage contributed negatively to the color removal our findings were similar to that of ramli et al 58 who also found that increasing the biocoagulant dosage contributes negatively to the turbidity and color removal and suggested that excess dosage increases the final turbidity and color of the wastewater this result occurred because the raw bioflocculant prodigiosin solution from s marcescens has a reddish color 59 60 in addition the color in aquaculture wastewater may be caused by the dissolved organic matters that are not the main targets of the coagulation flocculation and sedimentation treatment 61 62 the extraction of the bioflocculant produced by s marcescens is suggested to eliminate this phenomenon 51 63 64 3 3 comparison of bioflocculant performance the 10 bioflocculant dosage was chosen for the performance comparison as it exhibited the highest turbidity and ss removal percentages which were remarkably different compared with those of the control reactor the control bioflocculant only cacl2 only and alum reactors were run at 10 vol for the cacl2 bioflocculant reactor 10 bioflocculant assisted with 15 vol cacl2 were used to maintain the 2 3 coagulant to flocculant ratio following the method by agunbiade et al kurane and matsuyama and zakaria 54 65 66 the control reactor exhibited 81 29 turbidity removal 81 06 ss removal and 65 49 color removal the combination of cacl2 bioflocculant showed better performance compared with the reactors with cacl2 or bioflocculant only the result confirmed the previous finding that the compounds produced by bacteria act better as bioflocculants than as biocoagulants 54 67 68 the cacl2 bioflocculant reactor showed a turbidity removal of 85 45 a ss removal of 82 48 and a color removal of 67 99 the obtained parameters were still lower compared with those of the alum added reactor which showed a turbidity removal of 86 13 a ss removal of 83 50 and a color removal of 69 97 fig 3 the bioflocculant produced by s marcescens showed comparable performance compared with those in other researches table 2 although the final parameters of the s marcescens bioflocculant did not reach the standards ss color cod and nh3 n its overall removal efficiency was similar to those of other bioflocculants the optimization of operational conditions is highly suggested to reduce the concentration of pollutants below the permissible standard no significant differences in turbidity and ss removal percentages were found among the control cacl2 and bioflocculant reactors the cacl2 bioflocculant and alum reactors also had no remarkable differences in turbidity and ss removal alum had the highest color removal but no substantial differences in color removal were observed among all the reactors p 0 05 3 4 bioflocculant characteristics and flocculation mechanism the vibrational wave detected in the bioflocculant s ft ir spectrum was referred to the sigma aldrich infrared spectrum https www sigmaaldrich com my en technical documents technical article analytical chemistry photometry and reflectometry ir spectrum table to obtain its functional groups the result is presented in fig 4 alcohol groups were the major functional group detected in the bioflocculant and amines were also detected these compounds contribute to the anionic characteristics of the bioflocculant which may contribute to the charge neutralization mechanism in wastewater with abundant positively charged pollutants 73 whereas bridging is the most prominent mechanism for negatively charged pollutants 52 74 some researchers also reported some anionic bioflocculants produced by several bacterial species 74 76 the anionic characteristic was confirmed by ζ potential analysis in fig 5 the eps produced by s marcescens is an anionic flocculant with ζ potentials of 20 1 06 18 77 1 45 and 21 1 22 mv in ph 6 7 and 8 respectively the aquaculture effluent has a ph of 6 8 therefore the charge of the bioflocculant in this ph range was obtained as presented in fig 5 77 the results of the ζ potential and particle size distribution analyses are presented in fig 6 78 to understand the flocculation mechanism as shown in fig 6a the real aquaculture effluent has a negative ζ potential at 22 1 mv as the effluent is negatively charged the bioflocculant will not perform a charge neuralization mechanism because it has the same charge as the effluent 78 the addition of cacl2 into the system altered the ζ potential to 8 5 mv the addition of bioflocculant slightly shifted the ζ potential to 9 5 mv the bioflocculant has a charge of approximately 20 mv in addition to the ζ potential analysis the particle size distribution fig 6b revealed that cacl2 addition altered the particle size distribution during the treatment from z average of 293 2 d nm to 691 3 d nm the bioflocculant addition greatly altered the particle size distribution in the effluent to a z average of 2480 d nm differences in sludge morphology under the different treatments are depicted in fig 7 to accompany the particle size distribution fig 7 clearly indicates that the addition of the coagulant alum and cacl2 increased the floc size and density showed by the darker color the utilization of alum resulted in agglomeration as manifested by the denser particles compared with those in the cacl2 reactor the addition of the bioflocculant resulted in a long chain of floc with one solid structure compared with that in alum this floc structure indicated that flocculation through the bioflocculant occurred via the bridging mechanism 79 based on the ζ potential and particle size distribution fig 6 cacl2 increased the floc size via charge neutralization mechanism which then reduced the repulsive force between particles during treatment and resulted in the formation of bigger flocs as compared with the control fig 7a and b 80 a great alteration in particle size and a small shift in charge were obtained after the addition of the bioflocculant which indicated that particle bridging occurred during treatment as also confirmed by fig 7c 73 79 81 patch flocculation mechanisms did not occur in the present study as an excess positive charge is needed to patch the negatively charged pollutants in the aquaculture effluent 73 and the addition of cacl2 produced a system charge below zero negative in accordance with hatta et al 82 the bioflocculant produced by citrobacter youngae gtc 01314 also performed flocculation mechanisms via bridging choy et al 83 also reported that starch based flocculant induced the bridging mechanism by facilitating the interconnection between the flocs of microalgae during harvesting 4 conclusions s marcescens has displayed a potential as a bioflocculant producing bacteria the eps of s marcescens worked well as a bioflocculant rather than a biocoagulant aquaculture effluent has high ss content but the application of the bioflocculant produced by s marcescens at the optimum dosage of 10 v v remarkably reduced the turbidity and ss of the effluent by 83 95 and 78 82 respectively which were higher than the removal percentages of the control 80 98 and 76 99 respectively increasing the bioflocculant dosage had a negative effect on color removal as a decline in performance was observed when a higher bioflocculant dosage was introduced the floc morphology analysis indicated that the bridging mechanism occurred during flocculation using this compound which was supported by the slight alteration in ζ potential and the great increment in particle size during treatment the combination of cacl2 and the bioflocculant produced by s marcescens had a similar performance as alum under the same dosage p 0 05 declaration of competing interest

13023,aquaculture effluent contributes to surface water pollution coagulation flocculation and sedimentation are currently the best practices in aquaculture effluent treatment and the utilization of chemical coagulants or flocculants is still dominant in assisting the treatment processes this research aimed to analyze the potential of the bacteria based bioflocculant produced by serratia marcescens in treating real aquaculture effluent s marcescens was cultivated for 24 h inside tryptic soy broth medium and the produced bioflocculant was used in raw condition without extraction jar test and one variable at a time method were used to assess the effect of bioflocculant dosage and its performance was compared with that of alum a commonly used coagulant the bioflocculant produced by s marcescens worked well with the assistance of cacl2 the 10 bioflocculant dosage showed a remarkable removal of turbidity and suspended solid 83 95 and 78 82 respectively compared with the control 80 98 and 76 99 respectively increasing the bioflocculant dosage had a negative effect on color removal because the bioflocculant solution had a reddish color as a result of prodigiosin secretion by s marcescens zeta potential particle size distribution and microscopic analyses revealed that flocculation occurred via the bridging mechanism the utilization of cacl2 bioflocculant showed notable performances in turbidity and suspended solid removal compared with the control reactor while exhibiting a similar efficiency as alum p 0 05 bioflocculant extraction is suggested to be conducted in future research to eliminate its negative effect on the color parameter graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aquaculture biocoagulant cultivation environmental pollution fish wastewater treatment 1 introduction aquaculture is one of the industries that contribute greatly to surface water pollution 1 2 aquaculture effluent has high organic content high turbidity high suspended solid ss contents and a specific color 3 5 nonetheless aquaculture effluent also contains high nutrient levels in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus 6 8 ahmad et al 9 mentioned that freshwater aquaculture has a turbidity of 307 ntu a ss content of 427 mg l an ammonia content of 24 5 mg l a nitrate content of 11 9 mg l a phosphate content of 0 07 mg l and a chemical oxygen demand cod of 120 3 mg l similarly huang et al 10 also stated the contents of ammonium 2 35 mg l nitrate 0 51 mg l nitrite 0 13 mg l phosphorus 0 23 mg l and cod 66 6 mg l in fresh water aquaculture effluent nitrogen and phosphorus in aquaculture effluent originate from the utilization of fertilizer to maintain algal growth on multiculture and biofloc cultivation systems 11 13 these components may contribute to the eutrophication phenomenon if discharged to water bodies without any proper treatment 14 16 the current best practices in aquaculture treatment are coagulation flocculation and sedimentation 17 19 these methods are proven effective in treating most parameters in an aquaculture effluent heiderscheidt et al 20 exhibited the high performance of polyaluminium chloride in removing up to 98 of the turbidity ss and phosphate from an aquaculture effluent in addition gibson et al 18 also showed the successful treatment of ss from aquaculture effluent using polyacrylamide polymers the application of coagulation flocculation and sedimentation cannot be separated from coagulants and flocculants 21 22 the most widely used coagulant is alum alum exhibits great performance in removing turbidity and ss parameter from aquaculture effluent up to 98 20 23 despite their great efficiency the utilization of metal based coagulants in treating wastewater has received much concern such concerns include the change in aquatic ph stability and the production of nonbiodegradable sludge on top of the original ss existing in wastewater 24 26 the utilization of biocoagulants and bioflocculants shows a promising solution to overcome these emerging issues 27 biocoagulants and bioflocculants comprise plant materials bacteria microalgae and animal based compounds 28 endut et al 29 exhibited the performance of moringa oleifera derivates in removing ss from aquaculture effluent hamid et al 30 also addressed the potential of m oleifera as a bioflocculant in recovering algae from aquaculture effluent with recovery value up to 92 in addition yunos et al 31 also reported the suitability of using chitosan to recover macroalgae from aquaculture effluent with a recovery value of 80 the current development of bioflocculants has focused on plant and animal based compounds whereas study on bacteria based bioflocculants is still scarce moreover the application of bioflocculants in treating real aquaculture effluent is also limited 32 therefore this study aimed to unlock the potential of the bioflocculant produced by a bacteria species serratia marcescens in treating real aquaculture effluent and compare its performance to that of alum a commonly used coagulant s marcescens is a gram negative bacterium that can be found naturally in soil or water and is often associated with urinary respiratory and wound infections 33 despite of its nature and associated diseases this bacterium is capable of producing biosurfactants and degrading hydrocarbon compounds 34 35 however analyses on its extracellular polymeric substances epss as bioflocculants are rare 22 the utilization of this bacterium in water treatment as well as its association with several diseases is possibly because its epss do not contain any genetic materials 36 38 the good performance of bioflocculants was highlighted in this study as the combination of cacl2 and bioflocculant showed no remarkable difference in pollutant removal compared with alum the utilization of bioflocculants can produce sludge with greater biodegradability compared with alum which still needs to be further assessed in future research the presented results are expected to give new insight into the treatment of aquaculture effluent using environment friendly technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 source and characteristics of aquaculture effluent aquaculture effluent was obtained from a freshwater catfish cultivation in labu negeri sembilan malaysia samples were transferred from the sampling location to a laboratory in universiti kebangsaan malaysia for characterization the characteristics of the aquaculture effluent are tabulated in table 1 the contents of ss cod ammoniacal nitrogen and color in the effluent are above the standard limits 41 compared with values in other countries the tested ph for all data were still within the normal range cod nitrogen and phosphorus contents were also mentioned by other researchers 5 39 40 indicating that aquaculture effluent contains organic compounds and nutrients which need to be treated before the effluent can be discharged to water bodies 2 2 s marcescens culture s marcescens was isolated from the aquaculture effluent in semenyih malaysia this species is a gram negative bacterium that produces a red colored pigment called prodigiosin at room temperature 35 42 this isolated bacterial species was previously screened and showed the highest potential in producing bioflocculants for artificial turbid water 2 3 s marcescens growth and growth kinetics s marcescens growth was assessed to obtain the exponential phase of the isolate all testing stages were conducted using od600nm 1 a 43 the produced growth rate curve was used as the basis of

250 ml conical flask iwaki germany 44 tsb medium containing s marcescens inoculum was shaken for 24 h on 150 rpm inside a 37 c incubator shaker protech malaysia and optical density od reading was carried out hourly until 12 h and then once again at 24 h using uv vis spectrophotometer hach usa with a 600 nm wavelength 45 46 the growth curve was created by plotting the measured od versus time 47 the specific growth rate of s marcescens was calculated based on the measured od during the exponential phase following eq 1 48 49 1 μx dx dt where μ is the specific growth rate 1 h x is the optical density a and t is the time h 2 4 production of bioflocculant a 1 ml of s marcescens with od600nm 1a was inoculated into 99 ml of sterile tsb then shaken for 24 h at 150 rpm inside a 37 c incubator shaker 44 the bioflocculant produced by the bacteria was released into the growing medium as an eps 50 51 after 24 h of shaking the bacterial cell was separated with its medium by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min eppendorf germany 50 cell free supernatant containing the eps of s marcescens was used as the bioflocculant solution under raw condition without extraction from medium the bioflocculant was extracted from the growing medium by following the protocol given by hasan et al 50 for characterization the extracted dry bioflocculant was subjected to fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy for functional group analysis and zeta ζ potential was checked under ph 6 7 and 8 52 referring to the neutral ph range of aquaculture effluent summarized in table 1 2 5 analysis of optimum bioflocculant dosage optimum biocoagulant dosage was analyzed using one variable at a time ovat analysis different dosages 1 2 3 5 and 10 v v of the eps assisted by 2 3 volume of cacl2 acted as coagulant 50 53 were analyzed to determine their performance as bioflocculants a total volume of 300 ml aquaculture effluent cacl2 and bioflocculant was run inside a 500 ml beaker glass control reactors were made by substituting the bioflocculant volume with sterile tsb to compare with the performance of the bioflocculant the eps produced by the bacteria worked better as a bioflocculant than as a biocoagulant in which the application of eps need to be accompanied by a coagulant biocoagulant 54 55 turbidity removal was made by deducting the initial value with the final value of the tested parameter turbidity ss and color coagulation flocculation and sedimentation processes were run using a jar test set up with the following operational parameters rapid mixing at 150 rpm for 2 min slow mixing at 20 rpm for 10 min and sedimentation for 30 min 23 2 6 comparison of bioflocculant performance and mechanism determination a comparison of bioflocculant performances was performed by running jar test under different operational parameters using only aquaculture effluent only cacl2 only bioflocculant cacl2 bioflocculant and alum 29 the dosages of the different coagulants and flocculants used were determined from the optimum dosage obtained in the previous stage the same operational parameters for coagulation flocculation and sedimentation i e rapid mixing at 150 rpm for 2 min slow mixing at 20 rpm for 10 min and sedimentation for 30 min were applied in all jar experiments performances were compared in terms of turbidity ss and color removal percentages differences in sludge formation were also compared under 100 magnification using a microscope nikon eclipse e100 japan the mechanism was determined using ζ potential and particle size distribution analyses with a zetasizer malvern instrument uk 3 results and discussion 3 1 s marcescens growth and specific growth rate the growth curve of s marcescens is presented in fig 1 based on fig 1 the exponential phase of s marcescens was obtained within 5 7 h of incubation whereas the od600nm 1 a was obtained after 15 h of incubation according to these results s marcescens should be pregrown for a minimum incubation time of 15 h prior to use this finding was similar to that of jeffrey et al 56 who showed that the exponential phase of s marcescens is at 4 8 h of incubation and od600nm 1 a is obtained after 15 h of incubation the calculation of specific growth rate was conducted based on the exponential phase of s marcescens following eq 1 the specific growth rate of s marcescens was calculated as 0 2558 h 3 2 analysis of optimum bioflocculant dosage the results of parameter removal in different bioflocculant dosages are presented in fig 2 in terms of turbidity the control reactor showed an 80 98 removal of turbidity whereas the addition of bioflocculant in 10 dosage showed the highest removal of 83 95 the wastewater used had a turbid characteristic owing to the high level of ss particles discrete particles which are easily settled by gravity 57 the addition of different bioflocculant dosages did not remarkably increase the turbidity removal a substantial difference in removal was obtained between the control and the addition of 10 bioflocculant thus 10 dosage was chosen for the performance comparison a similar trend was obtained for ss ss is considered the major contributor to the turbidity of wastewater the control reactor showed 76 99 ss removal whereas the addition of bioflocculant in 10 dosage increased the ss removal up to 78 82 ss particles have a high molecular weight thus these particles can settle gravitationally no remarkable difference in ss removal was obtained under the different dosages but a substantial difference in ss removal was found between the control and the addition of 10 bioflocculant similar to the obtained trend on turbidity different trends were obtained in terms of color the control reactor showed a color removal of up to 61 52 whereas the addition of 10 bioflocculant decreased the color removal to 59 80 the highest color removal was obtained through the addition of 1 bioflocculant 62 42 this result indicates that increasing the bioflocculant dosage contributed negatively to the color removal our findings were similar to that of ramli et al 58 who also found that increasing the biocoagulant dosage contributes negatively to the turbidity and color removal and suggested that excess dosage increases the final turbidity and color of the wastewater this result occurred because the raw bioflocculant prodigiosin solution from s marcescens has a reddish color 59 60 in addition the color in aquaculture wastewater may be caused by the dissolved organic matters that are not the main targets of the coagulation flocculation and sedimentation treatment 61 62 the extraction of the bioflocculant produced by s marcescens is suggested to eliminate this phenomenon 51 63 64 3 3 comparison of bioflocculant performance the 10 bioflocculant dosage was chosen for the performance comparison as it exhibited the highest turbidity and ss removal percentages which were remarkably different compared with those of the control reactor the control bioflocculant only cacl2 only and alum reactors were run at 10 vol for the cacl2 bioflocculant reactor 10 bioflocculant assisted with 15 vol cacl2 were used to maintain the 2 3 coagulant to flocculant ratio following the method by agunbiade et al kurane and matsuyama and zakaria 54 65 66 the control reactor exhibited 81 29 turbidity removal 81 06 ss removal and 65 49 color removal the combination of cacl2 bioflocculant showed better performance compared with the reactors with cacl2 or bioflocculant only the result confirmed the previous finding that the compounds produced by bacteria act better as bioflocculants than as biocoagulants 54 67 68 the cacl2 bioflocculant reactor showed a turbidity removal of 85 45 a ss removal of 82 48 and a color removal of 67 99 the obtained parameters were still lower compared with those of the alum added reactor which showed a turbidity removal of 86 13 a ss removal of 83 50 and a color removal of 69 97 fig 3 the bioflocculant produced by s marcescens showed comparable performance compared with those in other researches table 2 although the final parameters of the s marcescens bioflocculant did not reach the standards ss color cod and nh3 n its overall removal efficiency was similar to those of other bioflocculants the optimization of operational conditions is highly suggested to reduce the concentration of pollutants below the permissible standard no significant differences in turbidity and ss removal percentages were found among the control cacl2 and bioflocculant reactors the cacl2 bioflocculant and alum reactors also had no remarkable differences in turbidity and ss removal alum had the highest color removal but no substantial differences in color removal were observed among all the reactors p 0 05 3 4 bioflocculant characteristics and flocculation mechanism the vibrational wave detected in the bioflocculant s ft ir spectrum was referred to the sigma aldrich infrared spectrum https www sigmaaldrich com my en technical documents technical article analytical chemistry photometry and reflectometry ir spectrum table to obtain its functional groups the result is presented in fig 4 alcohol groups were the major functional group detected in the bioflocculant and amines were also detected these compounds contribute to the anionic characteristics of the bioflocculant which may contribute to the charge neutralization mechanism in wastewater with abundant positively charged pollutants 73 whereas bridging is the most prominent mechanism for negatively charged pollutants 52 74 some researchers also reported some anionic bioflocculants produced by several bacterial species 74 76 the anionic characteristic was confirmed by ζ potential analysis in fig 5 the eps produced by s marcescens is an anionic flocculant with ζ potentials of 20 1 06 18 77 1 45 and 21 1 22 mv in ph 6 7 and 8 respectively the aquaculture effluent has a ph of 6 8 therefore the charge of the bioflocculant in this ph range was obtained as presented in fig 5 77 the results of the ζ potential and particle size distribution analyses are presented in fig 6 78 to understand the flocculation mechanism as shown in fig 6a the real aquaculture effluent has a negative ζ potential at 22 1 mv as the effluent is negatively charged the bioflocculant will not perform a charge neuralization mechanism because it has the same charge as the effluent 78 the addition of cacl2 into the system altered the ζ potential to 8 5 mv the addition of bioflocculant slightly shifted the ζ potential to 9 5 mv the bioflocculant has a charge of approximately 20 mv in addition to the ζ potential analysis the particle size distribution fig 6b revealed that cacl2 addition altered the particle size distribution during the treatment from z average of 293 2 d nm to 691 3 d nm the bioflocculant addition greatly altered the particle size distribution in the effluent to a z average of 2480 d nm differences in sludge morphology under the different treatments are depicted in fig 7 to accompany the particle size distribution fig 7 clearly indicates that the addition of the coagulant alum and cacl2 increased the floc size and density showed by the darker color the utilization of alum resulted in agglomeration as manifested by the denser particles compared with those in the cacl2 reactor the addition of the bioflocculant resulted in a long chain of floc with one solid structure compared with that in alum this floc structure indicated that flocculation through the bioflocculant occurred via the bridging mechanism 79 based on the ζ potential and particle size distribution fig 6 cacl2 increased the floc size via charge neutralization mechanism which then reduced the repulsive force between particles during treatment and resulted in the formation of bigger flocs as compared with the control fig 7a and b 80 a great alteration in particle size and a small shift in charge were obtained after the addition of the bioflocculant which indicated that particle bridging occurred during treatment as also confirmed by fig 7c 73 79 81 patch flocculation mechanisms did not occur in the present study as an excess positive charge is needed to patch the negatively charged pollutants in the aquaculture effluent 73 and the addition of cacl2 produced a system charge below zero negative in accordance with hatta et al 82 the bioflocculant produced by citrobacter youngae gtc 01314 also performed flocculation mechanisms via bridging choy et al 83 also reported that starch based flocculant induced the bridging mechanism by facilitating the interconnection between the flocs of microalgae during harvesting 4 conclusions s marcescens has displayed a potential as a bioflocculant producing bacteria the eps of s marcescens worked well as a bioflocculant rather than a biocoagulant aquaculture effluent has high ss content but the application of the bioflocculant produced by s marcescens at the optimum dosage of 10 v v remarkably reduced the turbidity and ss of the effluent by 83 95 and 78 82 respectively which were higher than the removal percentages of the control 80 98

morphology analysis indicated that the bridging mechanism occurred during flocculation using this compound which was supported by the slight alteration in ζ potential and the great increment in

rate is roughly 1 5 the world phosphorus ore mineral resources can only be sustained for about 100 years 2 as a result we urgently need to identify renewable resources and p alternatives every year roughly 1 3 million tons of p are released into sewage treatment plants in china 3 which may supply 12 15 of world phosphorus demand 4 biological or chemical phosphorus removal is often utilized in wastewater treatment plants to transfer approximately 90 of the p in sewage to sludge 5 as a result sludge has been identified as a potential source of p the pursuit of long term sustainable sludge phosphorus recovery technologies has become a research priority domestically and internationally recent worldwide study indicates that anaerobic digestion sludge contains a phosphate molecule called vivianite 6 vivianite is a mineral that is frequently found in lake sediments 7 dirt 8 9 and wetlands 10 it is a chemical compound composed of phosphorus and iron that is highly stable simultaneously

to identify alternative exogenous chemicals capable of promoting anaerobic digestion to replace zvi and nzvi rsi s inner includes zvi while its surface was coated with rust consisting primarily of fe2o3 this coating of rust can facilitate electron transport accelerate hydrogen generation by iron corrosion and boost the efficiency of acid production via anaerobic sludge fermentation 24 additionally certain insoluble organics in sludge might be oxidized preferentially by fe3 on the surface of rsi 24 increasing bacterial diversity enriching iron reducing bacteria and facilitating the

the properties of thickened was are shown in table 1 2 2 rsi rsi is irregular in shape and size the rsi was acquired from a nanjing mechanical processing factory prior to the experiment rsi was immersed in a 10 sodium carbonate solution for 10 min at 80 c to remove any oily dirt from its surface we crushed the rsi to avoid being concentrated in the bottom of the bottle and not in direct touch with the sludge then using a 100 mesh screen rsi powder with a lower particle size 150 μm was produced table 2 numerous iron reducing bacteria are present during anaerobic digestion 27 the

anaerobic bacteria transform macromolecular organic matter to tiny molecular organic matter in the device when there is little or no oxygen available the process is divided into four stages hydrolysis fermentation to generate acid and hydrogen production to generate acetic acid and methane hydrolysis is the anaerobic digestion process s rate limiting stage this experiment increases the amount of phosphorus released by adding rsi and adjusting the ph each 250 ml iodine flask was filled with 150 ml was 28 the ph was then changed to 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 and 10 0 using 1 mol l naoh or 1

supernatant tp and sp were utilized to assess the performance of p release in the p release experiment under varied ph settings fig 1 a b depicts the variations in tp and sp in the liquid as fermentation time progressed the levels of tp and sp in supernatant changed in a similar manner the bulk of aqueous tp in all samples 90 was po4 3 which was advantageous for future p recovery as vivianite in general acid or alkali treatment had a favorable effect on the release of p during anaerobic digestion although the effect varied depending on the ph the release performance of sp was classified into two groups based on its ph value and compared to the control group with ph of 7 0 sp concentrations rose in a variable manner in acidic environments with ph values ranging from 3 to 6 after 15 days it remained consistent at 28 6 28 5 29 9 and 33 9 mg l all of which were lower than those in the control group this might be due to the fact that the phosphorus released in acidic circumstances reacts with divalent iron to generate vivianite however it is possible that the sampling procedure in the experiment failed to maintain a strictly anaerobic condition leading in the formation of the micro aerobic environment and increased phosphorus absorption by partially autolytic microbes on the first day of the reaction the concentration of sp grew fast under alkaline conditions ph 8 0 9 0 and 10 0 reaching 6 8 14 1 and 57 4 mg l respectively dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria may convert fe3 to fe2 precipitating with po4 3 leading to a fast decrease in sp concentration vfas fig s2 generated by hydrolytic acidification bacteria can also be employed as an electron donor to decrease fe3 and as a carbon source for bacteria that accumulate phosphorus in excess sludge hence promoting phosphorus release 33 as a result the rates of fe0 dissolution iron salt precipitation and sludge phosphorus release alternate during the reaction resulting in substantial swings in the supernatant concentration of tp sp concentrations were 42 8 41 96 and 43 9 mg l on the 32nd day respectively greater than those in the control group it demonstrates that alkaline circumstances favor phosphorus release 3 1 2 optimal ph analysis as seen in fig 2 a lower ph can have the dual impact of increasing phosphorus release from bacteria and boosting rsi dissolution the maximum effectiveness of phosphorus removal occurs at a ph of 3 which is 22 48 times more than the efficiency at a ph of 10 demonstrating that acidic conditions are more favorable to phosphorus removal from sludge in the form of iron salt crystallization 3 1 3 analysis of reaction products sem was utilized to evaluate the crystal morphology and the change in sludge morphology during a 31 day anaerobic reaction with an initial ph of 4 or 8 fig 3 a b as seen in the image sludge with a ph of 4 is looser than sludge with ph of 8 the former produces primarily independent granular sludge whereas the latter produces sludge with flocculent properties and particles attached this suggests that a ph of 4 acidic is more favorable to the destruction of sludge flocs than a ph of 8 neutral weak alkali which has a greater role in encouraging phosphorus release from hydrolytic acidified sludge the xrd diffraction pattern of sludge is seen in fig 4 according to the figure analysis there was no vivianite present in the unreacted raw sludge as seen in fig 4 significant diffraction peaks at 2 equal to 11 196 13 219 18 101 19 577 23 073 26 57 27 897 30 081 32 945 33 236 and 35 543 were observed when ph was 4 and 8 these peaks corresponded to the standard card pdf 30 0662 of a synthetic vivianite crystal indicating that vivianite is formed during the phosphorus removal experiment from was therefore it can be judged that the main reaction product of adding rsi to remove p from was is vivianite was also contained impurities formed by mg2 al3 cu2 and zn2 such as ludlamite fe mn mg 3 po4 2 4h2o baricite mg fe 3 po4 2 8h2o etc 29 xrd diffraction pattern also showed that there may be baricite mg fe2 3 po4 2 8h2o cobalt manganese phosphate hydrate co2mn po4 2 8h2o annabergite ni mg3 aso4 2 8h2o connellite cu19 oh 32 so4 cl4 3h2o and kottigite zn3 aso4 2 8h2o and other products al3 had the most significant influence on the formation of vivianite however relevant investigations have demonstrated that when the al3 content in residual sludge is not excessive vivianite may be produced by adding rsi to the anaerobic digestion system however because there was no prominent diffraction signal for aluminophosphate products the fe al combined phosphorus recovered by the smt approach was primarily fep salt 3 2 effect of iron fe p molar ratio on phosphorus recovery efficiency 3 2 1 concentration change analysis of tp in supernatant as seen in fig 1c the concentration of tp in the supernatant changed significantly without adding rsi the tp concentration in the control group s supernatant climbed fast during the early stages of the reaction reaching 38 62 mg l on the ninth day and subsequently increased slowly as sludge was hydrolyzed after the reaction cycle was completed the supernatant contained 43 11 mg l tp the experimental group using rsi first had a negative trend followed by an upward trend due to the reaction s initial ph of 4 some microbes were suppressed and phosphorus could not be released quickly rsi began to exhibit symptoms eqs 1a 1c divalent iron produced enhances the action of hydrolysis bacteria and methanogens 16 22 methanogens enriched with fe3 34 can use the generated vfas fig s2 to generate methane these observations proved that ris has a good buffer capacity which can prevent the decline of ph and induce a stable anaerobic environment 35 the greater theβ the smaller the tp concentration at the end of the reaction the concentrations were 32 21 mg l 30 89 mg l 23 23 mg l 13 68 mg l and 6 12 mg l in turn after the reaction the tp concentration in the control group was 7 times that at β 8 3 2 2 product analysis fig 3 c d depicted the sem diagram of sludge after the reaction time ended at the conditions of β 1 5 and 4 0 as seen in the picture the product with a value of 1 5 had larger crystal particles and improved dispersion although crystal particles with a diameter of less than 4 0 nm were smaller they were predominantly adsorbed on bigger block products due of the relatively significant amounts of iron and phosphorus in rsi it cannot be dissolved over time and vivianite forms immediately on its surface when the iron phosphorus ratio is low rsi can be spread more uniformly throughout the reaction system resulting in a complete reaction demonstrating that the right addition of rsi may enhance the dissolving and even degradation of sludge surface structure 3 2 3 analysis of optimal fe p molar ratio fig 2b depicted the efficiency with which tp was removed from hydrolyzed acidified sludge following the process via fep crystallization as seen in the picture the fe p ratio considerably affects phosphorus removal efficiency the removal effectiveness of tp will steadily rise when the iron phosphorus ratio increases the exact fe p dose was not directly linked to the rate of tp elimination 3 3 effect of temperature on phosphorus recovery efficiency 3 3 1 analysis of tp concentration change in the supernatant as seen in fig 1d the total phosphorus concentration rose and then fell during the initial stages of the reaction before steadily increasing as the digestion time increased the higher the temperature the greater the amount of phosphorus released tp concentrations were 28 15 31 89 32 15 and 34 18 mg l after the process 3 3 2 optimal temperature analysis qian wang s response circumstances were comparable to those described in this study 36 37 magnesium and aluminum ions were found in the original sludge at quantities of 11 04 and 3 78 mg g at ph 7 44 in the 1 8 l reactor for anaerobic digestion and 4 7 and 10 02 mg g at ph 6 34 in the 600 ml reactor vivianite is formed at a temperature of 35 c smt was used to determine the rate of total phosphorus removal as shown in fig 2c as seen in the figure there was no discernible difference in the efficacy of phosphorus removal at various temperature settings the effectiveness of phosphorus removal did not vary much when the temperature was increased from 15 to 45 c because the primary processes of phosphorus release were the hydrolysis of polyphosphate in sludge and the disintegration of microorganisms in other words the ph and fe p ratio were the primary determinants of the amount of phosphorus removed in rsi 38 when the temperature was adjusted from low 15 c to medium 45 c certain anaerobic bacteria increased their activity releasing more vfas accumulation of vfas can lower the ph enhance rsi dissolution and expedite sludge hydrolysis however when the ph is low the activity of most anaerobic bacteria is hindered and the influence on the rate of phosphorus removal is still negligible this implies that temperature has only a slight effect on the generation of vivianite within the effective ph range several investigations have found no significant change in the ksp produced by vivianite at various temperatures 5 c to 90 c 39 qian wang hydrothermally treated the sludge and then studied the dynamic changes in phosphorus at various temperatures and periods the results indicated that vivianite was created between 90 and 125 c but that no vivianite was produced as time and temperature increased 36 40 the soluble p content in the digested effluent was identical at moderate and thermophilic temperatures indicating that temperature had the least influence on phosphorus release 41 3 4 orthogonal test a three factor four level orthogonal experiment was devised thirty days are allowed for reply ibm spss statistics 21 was used to conduct the analysis as shown in table 3a the process combination with the highest phosphorus removal efficiency is 45 c ph 4 and β 2 5 on average 23 35 of individuals were removed although temperature slightly influences the efficiency of phosphorus removal at a confidence level of 0 01 the effect is not particularly significant the ph value and fe p ratio are major determinants according to the analysis of variance data the order of importance of temperature ph and fe p on phosphorus removal efficiency is ph fe p temperature to ensure the trustworthiness of the experimental significant results the second inter subject effect test ntable 3c is run using the process combination as a factor its mistake is compared to that of table 3b and classified as an unintended error the results reveal that the interaction effect is considerable implying that the error computation in table 3b is insufficient to account for the mistake induced by probable factor interaction as a result the relevance of the intersubjective impact test findings in table 3b cannot be determined and only the theoretically best procedure may be chosen because the temperature has an effect on not only the rate of sludge hydrolysis and acidification but also on the efficiency with which vfas po4 3 p and other chemicals are released this indirectly affects the reaction system s ph value and other variables the duncan multi range test may be used to determine the appropriate process plan for a3b1c4 and a4b1c4 based on the phosphorus removal rate given that increasing the temperature incurs more costs 35 c is chosen as optimal the ultimate theoretically ideal process combination is a3b1c4 which corresponds to the findings of the single factor test achieving the ideal ph and fe p mole ratio may need large chemical additions raising prices and introducing possible environmental hazards we need to improve the process further to ensure application potential on the other hand we can consider treating specific acidic wastewater before initiating the reaction 4 conclusion rsi was added to surplus sludge in this investigation when the ph was raised from 3 to 10 the rate of tp removal by iron salt crystallization fell from 18 30 to 0 81 when the concentration of tp in the form of fep was raised from 1 0 to 8 0 the clearance rate rose from 10 44 to 51 37 the temperature has no influence on phosphorus removal effectiveness between 15 c and 45 c the optimal process combination in the orthogonal test is 45 c ph 4 iron phosphorus ratio 2 5 with an average removal rate of 23 35 funding this research did not receive any

alkaline circumstances favor phosphorus release 3 1 2 optimal ph analysis as seen in fig 2 a lower ph can have the dual impact of increasing phosphorus release from bacteria and boosting rsi dissolution the maximum effectiveness of phosphorus removal occurs at a ph of 3 which is 22 48 times more than the efficiency at a ph of 10 demonstrating that acidic conditions are more favorable to phosphorus removal from sludge in the form of iron salt crystallization 3 1 3 analysis of reaction products sem was utilized to evaluate the crystal morphology and the change in sludge morphology during a 31 day anaerobic reaction with an initial ph of 4 or 8 fig 3 a b as seen in the image sludge with a ph of 4 is looser than sludge with ph of 8 the former produces primarily independent granular sludge whereas the latter produces sludge with flocculent properties and particles attached this suggests that a ph of 4 acidic is more favorable to the destruction of sludge flocs than a ph of 8 neutral weak alkali which has a greater role in encouraging phosphorus release from hydrolytic acidified sludge the xrd diffraction pattern of sludge is seen in fig 4 according to the figure analysis there was no vivianite present in the unreacted raw sludge as seen in fig 4 significant diffraction peaks at 2 equal to 11 196 13 219 18 101 19 577 23 073 26 57 27 897 30 081 32 945 33 236 and 35 543 were observed when ph was 4 and 8 these peaks corresponded to the standard card pdf 30 0662 of a synthetic vivianite crystal indicating that vivianite is formed during the phosphorus removal experiment from was therefore it can be judged that the main reaction product of adding rsi to remove p from was is vivianite was also contained impurities formed by mg2 al3 cu2 and zn2 such as ludlamite fe mn mg 3 po4 2 4h2o baricite mg fe 3 po4 2 8h2o etc 29 xrd diffraction pattern also showed that there may be baricite mg fe2 3 po4 2 8h2o cobalt manganese phosphate hydrate co2mn po4 2 8h2o annabergite ni mg3 aso4 2 8h2o connellite cu19 oh 32 so4 cl4 3h2o and kottigite zn3 aso4 2 8h2o and other products al3 had the most significant influence on the formation of vivianite however relevant investigations have demonstrated that when the al3 content in residual sludge is not excessive vivianite may be produced by adding rsi to the anaerobic digestion system however because there was no prominent diffraction signal for aluminophosphate products the fe al combined phosphorus recovered by the smt approach was primarily fep salt 3 2 effect of iron fe p molar ratio on phosphorus recovery efficiency 3 2 1 concentration change analysis of tp in supernatant as seen in fig 1c the concentration of tp in the supernatant changed significantly without adding rsi the tp concentration in the control group s supernatant climbed fast during the early stages of the reaction reaching 38 62 mg l on the ninth day and subsequently increased slowly as sludge was hydrolyzed after the reaction cycle was completed the supernatant contained 43 11 mg l tp the experimental group using rsi first had a negative trend followed by an upward trend due to the reaction s initial ph of 4 some microbes were suppressed and phosphorus could not be released quickly rsi began to exhibit symptoms eqs 1a 1c divalent iron produced enhances the action of hydrolysis bacteria and methanogens 16 22 methanogens enriched with fe3 34 can use the generated vfas fig s2 to generate methane these observations proved that ris has a good buffer capacity which can prevent the decline of ph and induce a stable anaerobic environment 35 the greater theβ the smaller the tp concentration at the end of the reaction the concentrations were 32 21 mg l 30 89 mg l 23 23 mg l 13 68 mg l and 6 12 mg l in turn after the reaction the tp concentration in the control group was 7 times that at β 8 3 2 2 product analysis fig 3 c d depicted the sem diagram of sludge after the reaction time ended at the conditions of β 1 5 and 4 0 as seen in the picture the product with a value of 1 5 had larger crystal particles and improved dispersion although crystal particles with a diameter of less than 4 0 nm were smaller they were predominantly adsorbed on bigger block products due of the relatively significant amounts of iron and phosphorus in rsi it cannot be dissolved over time and vivianite forms immediately on its surface when the iron phosphorus ratio is low rsi can be spread more uniformly throughout the reaction system resulting in a complete reaction demonstrating that the right addition of rsi may enhance the dissolving and even degradation of sludge surface structure 3 2 3 analysis of optimal fe p molar ratio fig 2b depicted the efficiency with which tp was removed from hydrolyzed acidified sludge following the process via fep crystallization as seen in the picture the fe p ratio considerably affects phosphorus removal efficiency the removal effectiveness of tp will steadily rise when the iron phosphorus ratio increases the exact fe p dose was not directly linked to the rate of tp elimination 3 3 effect of temperature on phosphorus recovery efficiency 3 3 1 analysis of tp concentration change in the supernatant as seen in fig 1d the total phosphorus concentration rose and then fell during the initial stages of the reaction before steadily increasing as the digestion time increased the higher the temperature the greater the amount of phosphorus released tp concentrations were 28 15 31 89 32 15 and 34 18 mg l after the process 3 3 2 optimal temperature analysis qian wang s response circumstances were comparable to those described in this study 36 37 magnesium and aluminum ions were found in the original sludge at quantities of 11 04 and 3 78 mg g at ph 7 44 in the 1 8 l reactor for anaerobic digestion and 4 7 and 10 02 mg g at ph 6 34 in the 600 ml reactor vivianite is formed at a temperature of 35 c smt was used to determine the rate of total phosphorus removal as shown in fig 2c as seen in the figure there was no discernible difference in the efficacy of phosphorus removal at various temperature settings the effectiveness of phosphorus removal did not vary much when the temperature was increased from 15 to 45 c because the primary processes of phosphorus release were the hydrolysis of polyphosphate in sludge and the disintegration of microorganisms in other words the ph and fe p ratio were the primary determinants of the amount of phosphorus removed in rsi 38 when the temperature was adjusted from low 15 c to medium 45 c certain anaerobic bacteria increased their activity releasing more vfas accumulation of vfas can lower the ph enhance rsi dissolution and expedite sludge hydrolysis however when the ph is low the activity of most anaerobic bacteria is hindered and the influence on the rate of phosphorus removal is still negligible this implies that temperature has only a slight effect on the generation of vivianite within the effective ph range several investigations have found no significant change in the ksp produced by vivianite at various temperatures 5 c to 90 c 39 qian wang hydrothermally treated the sludge and then studied the dynamic changes in phosphorus at various temperatures and periods the results indicated that vivianite was created between 90 and 125 c but that no vivianite was produced as time and temperature increased 36 40 the soluble p content in the digested effluent was identical at moderate and thermophilic temperatures indicating that temperature had the least influence on phosphorus release 41 3 4 orthogonal test a three factor four level orthogonal experiment was devised thirty days are allowed for reply ibm spss statistics 21 was used to conduct the analysis as shown in table 3a the process combination with the highest phosphorus removal efficiency is 45 c ph 4 and β 2 5 on average 23 35 of individuals were removed although temperature slightly influences the efficiency of phosphorus removal at a confidence level of 0 01 the effect is not particularly significant the ph value and fe p ratio are major determinants according to the analysis of variance data the order of importance of temperature ph and fe p on phosphorus removal efficiency is ph fe p temperature to ensure the trustworthiness of the experimental significant results the second inter subject effect test ntable 3c is run using the process combination as a factor its mistake is compared to that of table 3b and classified as an unintended error the results reveal that the interaction effect is considerable implying that the error computation in table 3b is insufficient to account for the mistake induced by probable factor interaction as a result the relevance of the intersubjective impact test findings in table 3b cannot be determined and only the theoretically best procedure may be chosen because the temperature has an effect on not only the rate of sludge hydrolysis and acidification but also on the efficiency with which vfas po4 3 p and other chemicals are released this indirectly affects the reaction system s ph value and other variables the duncan multi range test may be used to determine the appropriate process plan for a3b1c4 and a4b1c4 based on the phosphorus removal rate given that increasing the temperature incurs more costs 35 c is chosen as optimal the ultimate theoretically ideal process combination is a3b1c4 which corresponds to the findings of the single factor test achieving the ideal ph and fe p mole ratio may need large chemical additions raising prices and introducing possible environmental hazards we need to improve the process further to ensure application potential on the other hand we can consider treating specific acidic wastewater before initiating the reaction 4 conclusion rsi was added to surplus sludge in this investigation when the ph was raised from 3 to 10 the rate of tp removal by iron salt crystallization fell from 18 30 to 0 81 when the concentration of tp in the form of fep was raised from 1 0 to 8 0 the clearance rate rose from 10 44 to 51 37 the temperature has no influence on phosphorus removal effectiveness between 15 c and 45 c the optimal process combination in the orthogonal test is 45 c ph 4 iron phosphorus ratio 2 5 with an average removal rate of 23 35 funding this research did not receive any
