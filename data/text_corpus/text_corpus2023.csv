understood to elucidate the overall groundwater nitrate situation in weifang a typical representative intensive planting area groundwater was sampled in 2009 and 2019 respectively the hydrochemical compositions nitrogen and oxygen isotopes were measured to trace the source and transformation of the nitrate and quantify the proportional contribution of nitrate sources of groundwater including sewage and manure m s soil nitrogen sn chemical fertilizer cf and atmospheric deposition ad in weifang china the concentration of nitrates in groundwater generally decreased and the groundwater quality improved significantly the reasons for the variation of nitrate sources between 2009 and 2019 were likely due to the reduction in the amount of fertilizer the number of livestock and the area of agricultural land land use affected the concentration of nitrates in groundwater which ranked as follows vegetable greenhouse vg winter wheat ww drinking and domestic water dw nitrification was the main process in the study area and the effect of denitrification was weak the study area was affected by mixed cf sn and m s contaminants according to the bayesian isotope mixing model siar the proportional contribution of each source was ranked as follows m s 65 09 sn 17 97 ad 9 32 cf 7 63 m s is the main source of no3 in this research identifying the source of nitrate pollution can cut off the source of pollution in a targeted way ensure the safety of groundwater in weifang and protect the agricultural environment of intensive agricultural area which has significance for nitrate prevention and control in other places keywords nitrate source spatial and temporal δ 15n δ 18o siar 1 introduction nitrate contamination of groundwater has become a severe problem worldwide agricultural cultivation is the main factor causing nitrate contamination high crop yields are achieved through the excessive use of chemical and organic fertilizers and the long term unsustainable application of nitrogen fertilizers causes the accumulation of large amounts of nitrate residues in soil that readily leach into groundwater therefore the nitrate contamination of groundwater in agricultural planting areas has become a pressing concern jin et al 2020 point source pollution such as concentrated industrial wastewater discharge is relatively easy to control however non point source contaminants such as the excessive application of agricultural fertilizers atmospheric subsidence and domestic sewage are more difficult to control due to the large range of contaminants and complicated mechanism the excessive application of nitrogen fertilizers is the main source of nitrate in groundwater even if groundwater is severely polluted groundwater contamination is not easy to identify and resolve as it is often colorless and has no taste nitrate no3 is one of the main forms of n in water bodies and no3 n concentrations exceeding 20 mg l 1 zhang et al 1995 in drinking water pose a hazard to humans causing issues such as cancer pastén zapata et al 2014 zhang and wang 2020 additionally high nitrate concentrations in water bodies can cause numerous ecological problems such as algal blooms wang et al 2019 the eutrophication of lakes and reservoirs and the eradication of species in river ecosystems gautam and iqbal 2009 li et al 2012 parnell et al 2010 in the natural environment the background no3 value is not typically high but human activities will cause the no3 content of the aquatic environment to increase sharply reaching the contamination level panno et al 2006 zhang et al 2020 anthropogenic activities particularly the overuse of chemical fertilizers and manure in intensive agricultural planting areas meghdadi and javar 2018 xue et al 2012 are the main sources of nitrate in groundwater gutiérrez et al 2018 however groundwater pollution can be addressed strategically with the adoption of suitable policies therefore tracing the source of groundwater is a critical step in improving the quality of water bodies in most circumstances nitrate is derived from manure and sewage m s chemical fertilizer cf soil nitrogen sn and atmospheric deposition ad kendall 2007 the traditional method of determining the source of groundwater nitrate is associating the land use types with the spatial and temporal variations in the chemical composition of groundwater however the results obtained by this method were mostly uncertain and rough resulting in inaccurate identification of nitrate sources since kohl kohl et al 1971 used the natural δ 15n isotope to trace sources of nitrate for the first time δ 15n isotopes have become a direct method of identifying nitrate sources however the δ 15n isotopic values may overlap leading to inaccurate nitrate source identification and influencing the applicability of isotopes alone δ 18o no3 can offer supplementary information to distinguish nitrate from cf and ad due to their distinctive values from those of the overlapping n isotopic values kendall 2007 different nitrate sources have distinctive n and o isotopic compositions kendall 2007 therefore the combination of δ 15n and δ 18o in no3 is a powerful indicator for tracing the source of groundwater nitrate kendall 2007 δ 15n and δ 18o isotopes have since been widely used to investigate nitrate sources migration and transformation processes chen et al 2013 li et al 2019 liu et al 2013 wu et al 2006 xu et al 2014 xue et al 2016 the nitrogen cycle is accompanied by the fractionation of nitrogen isotopes and the degree of fractionation caused by each action varies hosono et al 2013 therefore the tracing of sources should consider the fractionation of dual isotopes the use of dual isotopes combined with traditional tracing methods meghdadi and javar 2018 can obtain relatively accurate results as research has progressed the multi isotope nitrate source identification method has emerged widory widory et al 2004 2005 seiler seiler 2005 and xue xue et al 2013 used δ 15n δ 18o and δ 11b to trace the source of nitrate and confirmed that boron oxygen and nitrogen can be used to study nitrogen sources which can further improve the accuracy of tracing additionally the proportional contributions of nitrate sources can be determined using a bayesian mixing model stable isotope analysis in r liu et al 2018 xia et al 2017 weifang colloquially known as the hometown of vegetables in china is a typical representative intensive agricultural planting area in shandong province in the early 1990 s the application of chemical and nitrogen fertilizers reached a high level wang et al 2008 large number of crops and vegetables are grown in rural areas that require chemical and organic fertilizers during the growing period therefore the application of pure nitrogen fertilizer in vegetable cultivation is several or even tens of times higher than that in ordinary field crops cultivation but the nitrogen utilization rate is low w l zhang et al 2004 therefore nitrate contamination of groundwater in intensive vegetable growing areas requires attention however few studies have compared the changes in pollution of nitrate and traced the sources and transformation of nitrate in weifang groundwater over a ten year period this study aims to elucidate the overall situation of groundwater nitrate in weifang study the spatial temporal variations in the nitrate concentration in weifang and identify the sources and transformation of groundwater nitrate combine with traditional methods nitrogen and oxygen isotopes can be used to identify nitrate sources and conducting stable isotope analysis in r siar can quantify the contributions of different sources of nitrate groundwater contamination which can cut off the nitrate sources in a targeted way to ensure the drinking safety in weifang and protect the agricultural environment of intensive agricultural area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area weifang is located in western shandong peninsula between latitudes and longitudes of 35 41 37 26 n 118 10 120 01 e fig 1 respectively weifang covers a total area of 15 859 km2 accounting for approximately 10 of the total area of shandong province weifang has high terrain in the south low terrain in the north and hilly terrain in the south the lushan and yishan mountain are located in southwestern weifang which have the highest altitude and serve as the source of the main rivers weifang experiences a warm temperate monsoon type semi humid continental climate with an annual average temperature of 12 3 c with average annual precipitation of approximately 650 mm the four seasons are distinct with cold weather during the winter and hot weather during the summer the city s total land area is 1616 700 ha with agricultural land covering 1154 700 ha 792 700 and 694 600 ha of arable land and basic farmland respectively accounting for 71 42 of the total area vegetable greenhouses and winter wheat are the main crops and the groundwater in this area is used for drinking and irrigation 2 2 sampling and analyses groundwater samples were collected following the random principle from wells at 53 sites throughout weifang in november 2009 and april 2019 covering all cities in the region the sampling wells were divided into irrigation and drinking wells according to their function vg and ww are the main land use types for irrigation wells while the drinking wells are mainly used for drinking the sampling location depth and farmland utilization information of each sampling site were determined from the gps coordinates after filtration through a 0 45 µm filter membrane and the samples were frozen in a 20 c refrigerator until measurement a multi parameter meter was used to measure the ph and ec of the samples the no3 concentration was measured using a flow injection analyzer while the cl and so2 4 concentrations were measured using an ion chromatograph 940 professional ic vario the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 were measured at the environmental stable isotope laboratory institute of agricultural environment and sustainable development chinese academy of agricultural sciences caas following the denitrifying bacteria method casciotti et al 2002 xu et al 2012 first nitrate was transformed into n2o by denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas aureofaciens actt 13985 usa which naturally lack n2o reductase activity δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 were then measured using a trace gas preparation unit precon finnigan germany coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms delta v plus finnigan germany each headspace sample vial was placed into the sample tray of the gilson autosampler the n2o gas was delivered to tracegas through the autosampler n2o gas was then extracted purified and trapped by tracegas and the nitrogen and oxygen isotope concentration was finally measured using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer each 32 vials that typically have 20 unknown samples and 12 references among which are 4 vials of usgs32 4 vials of usgs34 and 4 vials of usgs35 are analyzed usg32 and usg34 are used to calibrate δ15n values and usg34 and usg35 are used to calibrate δ18o values coplen et al 2012 the analytical precision of δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 measurement was 0 25 and 0 5 respectively δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o was measured using an ultra high precision liquid water and water vapor isotope analyzer picarrol1115 i usa at the caas the analytical precision of δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o measurement was 0 5 and 0 1 respectively delta δ indicates the stable isotope ratios as follows kendall 1998 kohl et al 1971 1 δ r sample r standard r standard where rsample and rstandard are the 15n 14n or 18o 16o ratios of the samples and standards respectively including atmospheric nitrogen n2 and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 2 3 bayesian isotope mixing model a bayesian isotope mixing model implemented in the siar was first developed for use in food web analysis parnell et al 2010 the siar model is currently used for quantifying the contributions of dominant sources of nitrate in groundwater fadhullah et al 2019 fu et al 2019 ming et al 2019 wang et al 2017 the effects of isotope fractionation can also be considered many researchers xue et al 2013 zhang and wang 2020 zhang et al 2019 have successfully estimated the proportional contribution of multiple sources of nitrate using the siar model which can be expressed as follows parnell et al 2010 2 x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij 3 s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 4 c jk n λ jk τ jk 2 5 ε jk n 0 σ j 2 where x ij is the isotope value j of the mixture p k is the proportion of source k s jk is the source value k of isotope j which is normally distributed with the mean μ jk and standard deviation ω jk c jk denotes the isotope fractionation factor of isotope j on source k which is normally distributed with the mean λ jk and standard deviationτ jk ε ij represents the residual error and describes the additional unquantified variation between individual mixtures which follows a normal distribution with the mean 0 and standard deviation σj 3 results and analysis 3 1 water chemistry the properties of the 53 samples collected in weifang and land use types are shown in table 1 the ph of groundwater was alkaline 7 54 10 01 with a mean value of 8 14 the ec values varied from 213 9 to 3783 7 μs cm 1 with a mean value of 1004 1 μs cm 1 the so2 4 values varied from 8 78 to 967 12 mg l 1 with a mean value of 128 2 mg l 1 while the cl values varied from 7 76 to 866 6 mg l 1 with a mean value of 126 9 mg l 1 the cl ion is conservative meghdadi and javar 2018 and can be used to trace the source of nitrate among the three land use types the highest cl value was observed for winter wheat ww followed by vegetable greenhouse vg and the lowest was observed for drinking water dw which was likely due to intensive application of fertilizers during the winter wheat growth period 3 2 groundwater nitrate concentration characteristics 3 2 1 spatio temporal variations in the nitrate concentrations the nitrate concentration can characterize the degree of groundwater nitrate contamination the inverse distance weighted idw of geographic information system gis arcmap 10 2 was used for the spatial distribution of the nitrate nitrogen contents in the groundwater of weifang fig 2 which exhibited significant spatial variations between 2009 and 2019 the results showed that the overall nitrate contamination of weifang was more severe in 2009 the no3 concentration in weifang ranged from 1 82 to 150 mg l 1 in 2009 with a mean value of 27 94 mg l 1 and from 0 148 48 mg l 1 in 2019 with a mean value of 16 68 mg l 1 the nitrate concentration gradually increased from northwest to southeast during 2009 the central and southeastern regions were severely polluted while the nitrate concentration was low in the northwest fig 2a in 2019 the nitrate concentration gradually decreased from the center to the edge and the concentration was lower in the west and southeast fig 2b in 2009 and 2019 the nitrate concentration was high in the central region and the surrounding areas were low especially in the north southwest and southeast which related to land use types the edges of weifang are mostly lakes woodlands and grasslands etc fig 1 overall groundwater nitrate contamination in weifang has decreased and the water quality has been improved which is inseparable from environmental protection and sustainable development policies people s government of weifang 2012 people s government of weifang 2017 people s government of weifang 2018 the amount of chemical fertilizers used in agriculture equivalent to scalar amount decreased from 580 946 tons in 2009 437 034 tons in 2019 including nitrogen fertilizer phosphate fertilizer potash fertilizer and compound fertilizer compared with 2009 the number of livestock including cattle pigs sheep rabbits and the area of agricultural land have decreased in 2019 shandong statistical yearbook 2010 2020 therefore the reduction in the amount of fertilizer the number of livestock and the area of agricultural land may be the reason for the reduction of nitrate concentration in weifang 3 2 2 groundwater quality in weifang the nitrate concentration is an important indicator for evaluating water quality the world health organization who 2011 specified the maximum allowable nitrate content for drinking water of 50 mg l 1 equivalent to 11 3 mg l 1 of nitrate nitrogen the sanitary standards for drinking water gb5749 2006 stipulated a nitrate calculated as nitrogen limits for drinking water and groundwater sources of 10 and 20 mg l 1 respectively which also is the groundwater quality standard for drinking water used in china gb t14848 2017 when the nitrate nitrogen no3 n concentration exceeds than 3 mg l 1 it is affected by human factors babiker et al 2004 the level of nitrate in water is closely related to its quality and the quality of groundwater can be evaluated according to its nitrate content jia 2010 liu et al 2001 the groundwater quality was divided into the following five grades based on the above standards 2 mg l 1 excellent 2 5 mg l 1 good 5 10 mg l 1 meets the standard 10 mg l 1 exceeds the standard and 20 mg l 1 greatly exceeds the standard the comprehensive evaluation of the 53 water samples collected in 2009 and 2019 showed table 2 that the proportions of classes i ii iii iv and v in 2009 were 3 70 14 81 14 81 24 07 and 48 15 respectively directly drinking water and polluted water accounted for 27 78 and 72 22 of the total respectively approximately 48 15 of the groundwater samples severely exceeded the standard the proportions of classed i ii iii iv and v in 2019 were 11 11 11 11 11 11 25 93 and 40 74 respectively with direct drinking water and polluted accounting for 33 33 and 66 67 of the total respectively about 40 74 of the groundwater samples severely exceeded the standard the proportions of classes i ii iii iv and v in 2019 increased by 200 27 decreased by 24 98 increased by 19 98 increased by 7 73 and decreased by 15 39 from those in 2009 table 2 respectively overall the nitrate contamination in weifang during 2019 was lower than that in 2009 indicating that the groundwater quality had improved fig 2 however the proportion of polluted water was still very high and the condition of the groundwater cannot be ignored according to the current growth trend the supply of future drinking water will be threatened by the nitrate concentrations in some water wells therefore effort should be devoted to reducing no3 contamination in groundwater and ensuring the current and future safety of drinking water 3 2 3 no3 n under different land use type the no3 n concentration of the irrigation wells ranged from 1 98 to 150 mg l 1 mean value of 37 99 mg l 1 in 2009 and from 0 148 48 mg l 1 mean value of 20 38 mg l 1 in 2019 the no3 n concentration of the drinking wells ranged from 1 82 to 99 6 mg l 1 mean value of 23 14 mg l 1 in 2009 and from 0 0028 to 36 8 mg l 1 mean value of 14 49 mg l 1 in 2019 the no3 n concentration of the irrigation wells was higher than that of the drinking wells in both 2009 and 2019 which was consistent with the actual situation and the drinking water quality requirement was more stringent drinking water is safer than irrigation water therefore the groundwater in the intensive planting area of weifang is threatened by nitrate contamination and prevention and control measures should be implemented as soon as possible some high no3 concentrations were observed in the vg with a mean value of 22 19 mg l 1 which was attributed to vg entering the topdressing period during sample collection the no3 concentration of ww was moderate with a mean value of 17 87 mg l 1 and the lowest concentration was observed in drinking water ranging from 0 0028 to 36 8 mg l 1 with a mean value of 14 86 mg l 1 4 discussion 4 1 nitrate source tracing 4 1 1 groundwater no3 source tracing in weifang nitrate originates from various sources such as precipitation fertilizer soil nitrogen sewage and manure xue et al 2009 zhang et al 2018 2020 as the nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of the manure and sewage overlapped and exhibited similar isotopic compositions manure and sewage were regarded as the same contaminant source biddau et al 2019 yu et al 2020 the sources of nitrate have been identified from the cross plot of δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 fig 3 in many studies kendall 2007 according to previous studies different nitrate sources contain different nitrogen and oxygen isotope units table a 1 summarizes the ranges of δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 according to table a1 the ranges of δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 in this study were as follows atmospheric deposition 15 10 58 98 ammonium fertilizer 5 9 6 6 15 18 chemical fertilizer 7 4 6 8 18 25 soil n 3 9 15 18 manure and waste 4 25 15 18 the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values of the groundwater samples and typical potential source ranges in weifang are shown in fig 3 in this study the δ 15n no3 values ranged from 0 05 16 89 with a mean value of 7 60 the δ 15n no3 value in dw was higher than that in vg and ww the δ 18o no3 values ranged from 17 9 32 41 with a mean value of 10 41 the δ 18o no3 value in the vg exceeded that in the dw and ww the cross plot of δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 fig 3 showed that most of the groundwater samples in this study area were within the potential contaminant sources the values of δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 were mainly dispersed among the cf sn and m s while the values of δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 were relatively dispersed indicating that the three sources caused the nitrate contamination together owing to the overlap it is difficult to determine which source of nitrate was dominant as shown in fig 3 sn was one of the main contaminant sources indicating that years of fertilization caused the land to accumulate nitrates in weifang the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values fell out of the range of atmospheric deposition indicating that atmospheric deposition was not the main nitrate source of the groundwater the large bubbles were in the area of chemical fertilizers and the mixed areas of soil nitrogen and manure and sewage indicating that chemical fertilizers and mixtures soil nitrogen and manure and sewage have a greater impact on nitrate pollution 4 1 2 effects of land use types on nitrate sources the land use type directly affects groundwater contamination and affects the nitrate content zhang et al 2015 the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values of different land use types were distributed across different sources the sources of dw are mixed contaminants cf sn and m s which may be because sampling point had many uses such as living drinking breeding and planting in the farmhouse the main sources of vg were cf and m s which is consistent with the fertilization characteristics of vg ww was greatly affected by cf and sn which reflected the overuse of chemical fertilizers in the production of field crops resulting in a high nitrate nitrogen concentration in the soil only one point was outside the range of potential contamination sources and between those of fertilizer and precipitation which was attributed to the mixed contamination by fertilizer and precipitation 4 1 3 isotopic composition of molecular water as shown in table 1 the δ 2h h2o values in weifang ranged from 79 86 43 68 with a mean value of 59 9 the δ 2h h2o values of vg 57 88 exceeded in the dw 59 94 and ww 61 the δ 18o h2o values ranged from 11 53 7 17 with a mean value of 9 38 the δ 18o h2o values of the groundwater did not significantly differ between the three land use types however there was a significant correlation between δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o δ 2h h2o 8 0504δ 18o 15 587 r2 0 8558 the δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o values in weifang are compared with the global meteoric water line gmwl of δ 2h 8 1δ 18o 10 8 craig 1961 and the local meteoric water line lmwl of δ 2h 6 29δ 18o 3 63 calculated the local meteorological water level based on the data from the stations near weifang provided by the global precipitation isotope network gnip iaea in fig a1 as shown the δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o values of groundwater samples in the study areas were located near the gmwl and lmwl nejatijahromi et al 2019 indicating that atmospheric deposition was the primary source of groundwater in weifang the δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o values of groundwater exceeded those of gmwl and lmwl suggesting that the groundwater underwent intense evaporation during the recharge process fadhullah et al 2019 zhang and wang 2020 4 2 nitrification and denitrification the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values are mainly affected by their sources however biologically mediated processes mineralization nitrogen fixation nitrification and denitrification are important factors that cause the nitrogen and oxygen isotopes to fractionate kendall 2007 isotopic fractionation can alter the initial isotope compositions of sources kendall 2007 therefore denitrification affects the values of δ 15n and δ 18o which will affect the traceability results to determine whether denitrification occurred we conducted the following analysis during denitrification no3 n is transformed into n2 or n2o under the action of microorganisms and is an important self purification process of groundwater that causes the accumulation of residual nitrate δ 15n and δ 18o therefore determining the occurrence of denitrification is an important premise for identifying the source of nitrate contamination nisi et al 2013 the groundwater do values can also be used to assess denitriﬁcation when the do concentration exceeded 2 mg l 1 the denitriﬁcation eﬀect could be neglected fadhullah et al 2019 if denitrification occurs higher δ 15n values and lower no3 n concentrations will occur c y zhang et al 2004 zhou and jiang 2007 previous research reported that microbial denitrification increases the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values of water samples decreases the nitrate concentration and produces δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 ratios of 1 3 2 1 1 nikolenko et al 2018 panno et al 2006 the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 of groundwater exhibited significant negative relationships fig 3 indicating that the samples form weifang did not undergo denitrification li et al 2013b 2019 wang et al 2016 yue et al 2014 as shown in fig 4 the relationship between ln no3 cl and δ 15n no3 was not negative and denitriﬁcation could be ignored yin et al 2020 overall denitrification was weak and could be ignored in this study theoretically one third of no3 produced by microbial nitrification originates from atmospheric o2 and two thirds originate from h2o o the δ 18o no3 values due to microbial nitrification could be expressed by eq 6 durka et al 1994 li et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 6 δ 18 o nitrate 2 3 δ 18 o water 1 3 δ 18 o air where the δ 18o value from atmospheric o2 is 23 5 and δ 18o value is measured from the h2o o2 the theoretical δ 18o no3 values calculated from nitrification were approximately 2 ogrinc et al 2019 δ 18o no3 values in the range of 5 15 can be considered as nitrification kendall 2007 yue et al 2014 as shown in fig 5 the values of approximately half of the samples were near the theoretical value kendall 1998 suggesting the predominance of the nitriﬁcation process in the groundwater of weifang the δ 18o no3 values of some samples were lighter than the theoretical value which may be attributed to the exchange of oxygen atoms between water and nitrate kool et al 2011 the δ 18o no3 values of some samples exceeded the theoretical value which might be due to the influence of atmospheric sources kendall 2007 yue et al 2014 therefore denitrification was further supported which was not the main factor and the influence of denitrification fractionation could be ignored in this study 4 3 proportional contributions of the source a bayesian mixing model was used to estimate the proportional contribution of groundwater nitrate sources in weifang two isotopes j 2 δ 15n and δ 18o and four sources k 4 cf sn m s and ad were considered as ammonium fertilizer had a weak impact on the nitrate source which was not included furthermore the effect of denitrification could be ignored and the fractionation factor cjk was set to 0 the proportional contribution fig 6 decreased in the following order m s 65 09 sn 17 97 ad 9 32 cf 7 63 it was surprising that sewage and manure constituted the highest proportion of groundwater nitrate in weifang more manure is used in actual production part of the water samples are collected from places affected by man made activities which is closely related to the high contribution proportion of m s the proportional contribution of sn was high which was attributed to the several years of planting that led to the persistent contamination of nitrates and high nitrate content in soil the proportional contribution of contaminant sources under different land use types was ranked as follows m s sn cf ad dw m s 52 99 sn 28 16 cf 11 04 ad 7 80 vg m s 31 02 sn 28 64 cf 23 19 ad 17 15 ww m s 44 63 sn 28 78 cf 15 99 ad 10 60 compared with dw the contribution of m s is lower and the contribution of chemical fertilizer is higher in ww which is related to the application of chemical fertilizer in pursuit of high yield and less pollution from domestic sewage and manure in ww the proportional contribution of different sources of nitrate was not significantly different in vg which may have been due to the large amount of fertilizer and manure used in intensive planting resulting in a higher proportion of fertilizers than other types in fig 6 major source of nitrate in dw and ww was manure and septic waste m s and there is no big difference of sources of sn and m s in vg as recharge rate of groundwater is different in dw ww and vg it indicates more sn has not leached to groundwater in dw and ww however more sn leached to groundwater in vg because of the larger irrigation and larger fertilizer application level in vg than other land use types therefore nitrate pollution of vg is more serious than dw and ww which is consistent with the previous conclusion according to the siar model results the use of manure and discharge of sewage should be reduced in weifang to quickly reduce the level of nitrate contamination 5 conclusions in this study we traced the sources and transformation of nitrate from groundwater in weifang from the stable isotopes of nitrate and hydro chemical compositions of groundwater and quantified the proportional contributions of the nitrate sources using a bayesian isotope mixing model the cross plot of δ 15n no3 and δ 18 o no3 showed that cf sn and m s were the main nitrate source nitrification was the main process in the study area and the effect of denitrification can be ignored the proportional contribution of each source was ranked as follows m s 65 09 sn 17 97 ad 9 32 cf 7 63 based on the comparison of the nitrate concentrations of groundwater in weifang during 2009 and 2019 we found that the concentration of nitrates in groundwater generally decreased indicating that the quality of groundwater improved significantly and depended on the local government making correct decisions and good environmental awareness as the nitrate concentration of drinking water was lower than that of irrigation water the quality of drinking water was ensured under different land use types the groundwater nitrate concentration was ranked as follows vg ww dw the nitrogen cycle was accompanied by complex fractionation which affected the accuracy of tracing future research should carefully analyze fractionation to ensure accurate results in this study the source of groundwater nitrate was determined and a theoretical basis for effective management and control of nitrate inputs was provided considering the characteristics of the intensive planting area improved manure utilization efficiency is necessary for the sustainable development of local agriculture declaration of competing interest the authors

10115,agricultural non point contaminants are the main source of groundwater nitrate in china the source and transformation of groundwater nitrate in the intensive agricultural region must be understood to elucidate the overall groundwater nitrate situation in weifang a typical representative intensive planting area groundwater was sampled in 2009 and 2019 respectively the hydrochemical compositions nitrogen and oxygen isotopes were measured to trace the source and transformation of the nitrate and quantify the proportional contribution of nitrate sources of groundwater including sewage and manure m s soil nitrogen sn chemical fertilizer cf and atmospheric deposition ad in weifang china the concentration of nitrates in groundwater generally decreased and the groundwater

prevention and control in other places keywords nitrate source spatial and temporal δ 15n δ 18o siar 1 introduction nitrate contamination of groundwater has become a severe problem worldwide agricultural cultivation is the main factor causing nitrate contamination high crop yields are achieved through the excessive use of chemical and organic fertilizers and the long term unsustainable application of nitrogen fertilizers causes the accumulation of large amounts of nitrate residues in soil that readily leach into groundwater therefore the nitrate contamination of groundwater in agricultural planting areas has become a pressing concern jin et al 2020 point source pollution such as concentrated industrial wastewater discharge is relatively easy to control however non point source contaminants such as the excessive application of agricultural fertilizers atmospheric subsidence and domestic sewage are more difficult to control due to the large range of contaminants and complicated mechanism the excessive application of nitrogen fertilizers is the main source of nitrate in groundwater even if groundwater is severely polluted groundwater contamination is not easy to identify and resolve as it is often colorless and has no taste nitrate no3 is one of the main forms of n in water bodies and no3 n concentrations exceeding 20 mg l 1 zhang et al 1995 in drinking water pose a hazard to humans causing issues such as cancer pastén zapata et al 2014 zhang and wang 2020 additionally high nitrate concentrations in water bodies can cause numerous ecological problems such as algal blooms wang et al 2019 the eutrophication of lakes and reservoirs and the eradication of species in river ecosystems gautam and iqbal 2009 li et al 2012 parnell et al 2010 in the natural environment the background no3 value is not typically high but human activities will cause the no3 content of the aquatic environment to increase sharply reaching the contamination level panno et al 2006 zhang et al 2020 anthropogenic activities particularly the overuse of chemical fertilizers and manure in intensive agricultural planting areas meghdadi and javar 2018 xue et al 2012 are the main sources of nitrate in groundwater gutiérrez et al 2018 however groundwater pollution can be addressed strategically with the adoption of suitable policies therefore tracing the source of groundwater is a critical step in improving the quality of water bodies in most circumstances nitrate is derived from manure and sewage m s chemical fertilizer cf soil nitrogen sn and atmospheric deposition ad kendall 2007 the traditional method of determining the source of groundwater nitrate is associating the land use types with the spatial and temporal variations in the chemical composition of groundwater however the results obtained by this method were mostly uncertain and rough resulting in inaccurate identification of nitrate sources since kohl kohl et al 1971 used the natural δ 15n isotope to trace sources of nitrate for the first time δ 15n isotopes have become a direct method of identifying nitrate sources however the δ 15n isotopic values may overlap leading to inaccurate nitrate source identification and influencing the applicability of isotopes alone δ 18o no3 can offer supplementary information to distinguish nitrate from cf and ad due to their distinctive values from those of the overlapping n isotopic values kendall 2007 different nitrate sources have distinctive n and o isotopic compositions kendall 2007 therefore the combination of δ 15n and δ 18o in no3 is a powerful indicator for tracing the source of groundwater nitrate kendall 2007 δ 15n and δ 18o isotopes have since been widely used to investigate nitrate sources migration and transformation processes chen et al 2013 li et al 2019 liu et al 2013 wu et al 2006 xu et al 2014 xue et al 2016 the nitrogen cycle is accompanied by the fractionation of nitrogen isotopes and the degree of fractionation caused by each action varies hosono et al 2013 therefore the tracing of sources should consider the fractionation of dual isotopes the use of dual isotopes combined with traditional tracing methods meghdadi and javar 2018 can obtain relatively accurate results as research has progressed the multi isotope nitrate source identification method has emerged widory widory et al 2004 2005 seiler seiler 2005 and xue xue et al 2013 used δ 15n δ 18o and δ 11b to trace the source of nitrate and confirmed that boron oxygen and nitrogen can be used to study nitrogen sources which can further improve the accuracy of tracing additionally the proportional contributions of nitrate sources can be determined using a bayesian mixing model stable isotope analysis in r liu et al 2018 xia et al 2017 weifang colloquially known as the hometown of vegetables in china is a typical representative intensive agricultural planting area in shandong province in the early 1990 s the application of chemical and nitrogen fertilizers reached a high level wang et al 2008 large number of crops and vegetables are grown in rural areas that require chemical and organic fertilizers during the growing period therefore the application of pure nitrogen fertilizer in vegetable cultivation is several or even tens of times higher than that in ordinary field crops cultivation but the nitrogen utilization rate is low w l zhang et al 2004 therefore nitrate contamination of groundwater in intensive vegetable growing areas requires attention however few studies have compared the changes in pollution of nitrate and traced the sources and transformation of nitrate in weifang groundwater over a ten year period this study aims to elucidate the overall situation of groundwater nitrate in weifang study the spatial temporal variations in the nitrate concentration in weifang and identify the sources and transformation of groundwater nitrate combine with traditional methods nitrogen and oxygen isotopes can be used to identify nitrate sources and conducting stable isotope analysis in r siar can quantify the contributions of different sources of nitrate groundwater contamination which can cut off the nitrate sources in a targeted way to ensure the drinking safety in weifang and protect the agricultural environment of intensive agricultural area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area weifang is located in western shandong peninsula between latitudes and longitudes of 35 41 37 26 n 118 10 120 01 e fig 1 respectively weifang covers a total area of 15 859 km2 accounting for approximately 10 of the total area of shandong province weifang has high terrain in the south low terrain in the north and hilly terrain in the south the lushan and yishan mountain are located in southwestern weifang which have the highest altitude and serve as the source of the main rivers weifang experiences a warm temperate monsoon type semi humid continental climate with an annual average temperature of 12 3 c with average annual precipitation of approximately 650 mm the four seasons are distinct with cold weather during the winter and hot weather during the summer the city s total land area is 1616 700 ha with agricultural land covering 1154 700 ha 792 700 and 694 600 ha of arable land and basic farmland respectively accounting for 71 42 of the total area vegetable greenhouses and winter wheat are the main crops and the groundwater in this area is used for drinking and irrigation 2 2 sampling and analyses groundwater samples were collected following the random principle from wells at 53 sites throughout weifang in november 2009 and april 2019 covering all cities in the region the sampling wells were divided into irrigation and drinking wells according to their function vg and ww are the main land use types for irrigation wells while the drinking wells are mainly used for drinking the sampling location depth and farmland utilization information of each sampling site were determined from the gps coordinates after filtration through a 0 45 µm filter membrane and the samples were frozen in a 20 c refrigerator until measurement a multi parameter meter was used to measure the ph and ec of the samples the no3 concentration was measured using a flow injection analyzer while the cl and so2 4 concentrations were measured using an ion chromatograph 940 professional ic vario the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 were measured at the environmental stable isotope laboratory institute of agricultural environment and sustainable development chinese academy of agricultural sciences caas following the denitrifying bacteria method casciotti et al 2002 xu et al 2012 first nitrate was transformed into n2o by denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas aureofaciens actt 13985 usa which naturally lack n2o reductase activity δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 were then measured using a trace gas preparation unit precon finnigan germany coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms delta v plus finnigan germany each headspace sample vial was placed into the sample tray of the gilson autosampler the n2o gas was delivered to tracegas through the autosampler n2o gas was then extracted purified and trapped by tracegas and the nitrogen and oxygen isotope concentration was finally measured using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer each 32 vials that typically have 20 unknown samples and 12 references among which are 4 vials of usgs32 4 vials of usgs34 and 4 vials of usgs35 are analyzed usg32 and usg34 are used to calibrate δ15n values and usg34 and usg35 are used to calibrate δ18o values coplen et al 2012 the analytical precision of δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 measurement was 0 25 and 0 5 respectively δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o was measured using an ultra high precision liquid water and water vapor isotope analyzer picarrol1115 i usa at the caas the analytical precision of δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o measurement was 0 5 and 0 1 respectively delta δ indicates the stable isotope ratios as follows kendall 1998 kohl et al 1971 1 δ r sample r standard r standard where rsample and rstandard are the 15n 14n or 18o 16o ratios of the samples and standards respectively including atmospheric nitrogen n2 and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 2 3 bayesian isotope mixing model a bayesian isotope mixing model implemented in the siar was first developed for use in food web analysis parnell et al 2010 the siar model is currently used for quantifying the contributions of dominant sources of nitrate in groundwater fadhullah et al 2019 fu et al 2019 ming et al 2019 wang et al 2017 the effects of isotope fractionation can also be considered many researchers xue et al 2013 zhang and wang 2020 zhang et al 2019 have successfully estimated the proportional contribution of multiple sources of nitrate using the siar model which can be expressed as follows parnell et al 2010 2 x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij 3 s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 4 c jk n λ jk τ jk 2 5 ε jk n 0 σ j 2 where x ij is the isotope value j of the mixture p k is the proportion of source k s jk is the source value k of isotope j which is normally distributed with the mean μ jk and standard deviation ω jk c jk denotes the isotope fractionation factor of isotope j on source k which is normally distributed with the mean λ jk and standard deviationτ jk ε ij represents the residual error and describes the additional unquantified variation between individual mixtures which follows a normal distribution with the mean 0 and standard deviation σj 3 results and analysis 3 1 water chemistry the properties of the 53 samples collected in weifang and land use types are shown in table 1 the ph of groundwater was alkaline 7 54 10 01 with a mean value of 8 14 the ec values varied from 213 9 to 3783 7 μs cm 1 with a mean value of 1004 1 μs cm 1 the so2 4 values varied from 8 78 to 967 12 mg l 1 with a mean value of 128 2 mg l 1 while the cl values varied from 7 76 to 866 6 mg l 1 with a mean value of 126 9 mg l 1 the cl ion is conservative meghdadi and javar 2018 and can be used to trace the source of nitrate among the three land use types the highest cl value was observed for winter wheat ww followed by vegetable greenhouse vg and the lowest was observed for drinking water dw which was likely due to intensive application of fertilizers during the winter wheat growth period 3 2 groundwater nitrate concentration characteristics 3 2 1 spatio temporal variations in the nitrate concentrations the nitrate concentration can characterize the degree of groundwater nitrate contamination the inverse distance weighted idw of geographic information system gis arcmap 10 2 was used for the spatial distribution of the nitrate nitrogen contents in the groundwater of weifang fig 2 which exhibited significant spatial variations between 2009 and 2019 the results showed that the overall nitrate contamination of weifang was more severe in 2009 the no3 concentration in weifang ranged from 1 82 to 150 mg l 1 in 2009 with a mean value of 27 94 mg l 1 and from 0 148 48 mg l 1 in 2019 with a mean value of 16 68 mg l 1 the nitrate concentration gradually increased from northwest to southeast during 2009 the central and southeastern regions were severely polluted while the nitrate concentration was low in the northwest fig 2a in 2019 the nitrate concentration gradually decreased from the center to the edge and the concentration was lower in the west and southeast fig 2b in 2009 and 2019 the nitrate concentration was high in the central region and the surrounding areas were low especially in the north southwest and southeast which related to land use types the edges of weifang are mostly lakes woodlands and grasslands etc fig 1 overall groundwater nitrate contamination in weifang has decreased and the water quality has been improved which is inseparable from environmental protection and sustainable development policies people s government of weifang 2012 people s government of weifang 2017 people s government of weifang 2018 the amount of chemical fertilizers used in agriculture equivalent to scalar amount decreased from 580 946 tons in 2009 437 034 tons in 2019 including nitrogen fertilizer phosphate fertilizer potash fertilizer and compound fertilizer compared with 2009 the number of livestock including cattle pigs sheep rabbits and the area of agricultural land have decreased in 2019 shandong statistical yearbook 2010 2020 therefore the reduction in the amount of fertilizer the number of livestock and the area of agricultural land may be the reason for the reduction of nitrate concentration in weifang 3 2 2 groundwater quality in weifang the nitrate concentration is an important indicator for evaluating water quality the world health organization who 2011 specified the maximum allowable nitrate content for drinking water of 50 mg l 1 equivalent to 11 3 mg l 1 of nitrate nitrogen the sanitary standards for drinking water gb5749 2006 stipulated a nitrate calculated as nitrogen limits for drinking water and groundwater sources of 10 and 20 mg l 1 respectively which also is the groundwater quality standard for drinking water used in china gb t14848 2017 when the nitrate nitrogen no3 n concentration exceeds than 3 mg l 1 it is affected by human factors babiker et al 2004 the level of nitrate in water is closely related to its quality and the quality of groundwater can be evaluated according to its nitrate content jia 2010 liu et al 2001 the groundwater quality was divided into the following five grades based on the above standards 2 mg l 1 excellent 2 5 mg l 1 good 5 10 mg l 1 meets the standard 10 mg l 1 exceeds the standard and 20 mg l 1 greatly exceeds the standard the comprehensive evaluation of the 53 water samples collected in 2009 and 2019 showed table 2 that the proportions of classes i ii iii iv and v in 2009 were 3 70 14 81 14 81 24 07 and 48 15 respectively directly drinking water and polluted water accounted for 27 78 and 72 22 of the total respectively approximately 48 15 of the groundwater samples severely exceeded the standard the proportions of classed i ii iii iv and v in 2019 were 11 11 11 11 11 11 25 93 and 40 74 respectively with direct drinking water and polluted accounting for 33 33 and 66 67 of the total respectively about 40 74 of the groundwater samples severely exceeded the standard the proportions of classes i ii iii iv and v in 2019 increased by 200 27 decreased by 24 98 increased by 19 98 increased by 7 73 and decreased by 15 39 from those in 2009 table 2 respectively overall the nitrate contamination in weifang during 2019 was lower than that in 2009 indicating that the groundwater quality had improved fig 2 however the proportion of polluted water was still very high and the condition of the groundwater cannot be ignored according to the current growth trend the supply of future drinking water will be threatened by the nitrate concentrations in some water wells therefore effort should be devoted to reducing no3 contamination in groundwater and ensuring the current and future safety of drinking water 3 2 3 no3 n under different land use type the no3 n concentration of the irrigation wells ranged from 1 98 to 150 mg l 1 mean value of 37 99 mg l 1 in 2009 and from 0 148 48 mg l 1 mean value of 20 38 mg l 1 in 2019 the no3 n concentration of the drinking wells ranged from 1 82 to 99 6 mg l 1 mean value of 23 14 mg l 1 in 2009 and from 0 0028 to 36 8 mg l 1 mean value of 14 49 mg l 1 in 2019 the no3 n concentration of the irrigation wells was higher than that of the drinking wells in both 2009 and 2019 which was consistent with the actual situation and the drinking water quality requirement was more stringent drinking water is safer than irrigation water therefore the groundwater in the intensive planting area of weifang is threatened by nitrate contamination and prevention and control measures should be implemented as soon as possible some high no3 concentrations were observed in the vg with a mean value of 22 19 mg l 1 which was attributed to vg entering the topdressing period during sample collection the no3 concentration of ww was moderate with a mean value of 17 87 mg l 1 and the lowest concentration was observed in drinking water ranging from 0 0028 to 36 8 mg l 1 with a mean value of 14 86 mg l 1 4 discussion 4 1 nitrate source tracing 4 1 1 groundwater no3 source tracing in weifang nitrate originates from various sources such as precipitation fertilizer soil nitrogen sewage and manure xue et al 2009 zhang et al 2018 2020 as the nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of the manure and sewage overlapped and exhibited similar isotopic compositions manure and sewage were regarded as the same contaminant source biddau et al 2019 yu et al 2020 the sources of nitrate have been identified from the cross plot of δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 fig 3 in many studies kendall 2007 according to previous studies different nitrate sources contain different nitrogen and oxygen isotope units table a 1 summarizes the ranges of δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 according to table a1 the ranges of δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 in this study were as follows atmospheric deposition 15 10 58 98 ammonium fertilizer 5 9 6 6 15 18 chemical fertilizer 7 4 6 8 18 25 soil n 3 9 15 18 manure and waste 4 25 15 18 the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values of the groundwater samples and typical potential source ranges in weifang are shown in fig 3 in this study the δ 15n no3 values ranged from 0 05 16 89 with a mean value of 7 60 the δ 15n no3 value in dw was higher than that in vg and ww the δ 18o no3 values ranged from 17 9 32 41 with a mean value of 10 41 the δ 18o no3 value in the vg exceeded that in the dw and ww the cross plot of δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 fig 3 showed that most of the groundwater samples in this study area were within the potential contaminant sources the values of δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 were mainly dispersed among the cf sn and m s while the values of δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 were relatively dispersed indicating that the three sources caused the nitrate contamination together owing to the overlap it is difficult to determine which source of nitrate was dominant as shown in fig 3 sn was one of the main contaminant sources indicating that years of fertilization caused the land to accumulate nitrates in weifang the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values fell out of the range of atmospheric deposition indicating that atmospheric deposition was not the main nitrate source of the groundwater the large bubbles were in the area of chemical fertilizers and the mixed areas of soil nitrogen and manure and sewage indicating that chemical fertilizers and mixtures soil nitrogen and manure and sewage have a greater impact on nitrate pollution 4 1 2 effects of land use types on nitrate sources the land use type directly affects groundwater contamination and affects the nitrate content zhang et al 2015 the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values of different land use types were distributed across different sources the sources of dw are mixed contaminants cf sn and m s which may be because sampling point had many uses such as living drinking breeding and planting in the farmhouse the main sources of vg were cf and m s which is consistent with the fertilization characteristics of vg ww was greatly affected by cf and sn which reflected the overuse of chemical fertilizers in the production of field crops resulting in a high nitrate nitrogen concentration in the soil only one point was outside the range of potential contamination sources and between those of fertilizer and precipitation which was attributed to the mixed contamination by fertilizer and precipitation 4 1 3 isotopic composition of molecular water as shown in table 1 the δ 2h h2o values in weifang ranged from 79 86 43 68 with a mean value of 59 9 the δ 2h h2o values of vg 57 88 exceeded in the dw 59 94 and ww 61 the δ 18o h2o values ranged from 11 53 7 17 with a mean value of 9 38 the δ 18o h2o values of the groundwater did not significantly differ between the three land use types however there was a significant correlation between δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o δ 2h h2o 8 0504δ 18o 15 587 r2 0 8558 the δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o values in weifang are compared with the global meteoric water line gmwl of δ 2h 8 1δ 18o 10 8 craig 1961 and the local meteoric water line lmwl of δ 2h 6 29δ 18o 3 63 calculated the local meteorological water level based on the data from the stations near weifang provided by the global precipitation isotope network gnip iaea in fig a1 as shown the δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o values of groundwater samples in the study areas were located near the gmwl and lmwl nejatijahromi et al 2019 indicating that atmospheric deposition was the primary source of groundwater in weifang the δ 2h h2o and δ 18o h2o values of groundwater exceeded those of gmwl and lmwl suggesting that the groundwater underwent intense evaporation during the recharge process fadhullah et al 2019 zhang and wang 2020 4 2 nitrification and denitrification the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values are mainly affected by their sources however biologically mediated processes mineralization nitrogen fixation nitrification and denitrification are important factors that cause the nitrogen and oxygen isotopes to fractionate kendall 2007 isotopic fractionation can alter the initial isotope compositions of sources kendall 2007 therefore denitrification affects the values of δ 15n and δ 18o which will affect the traceability results to determine whether denitrification occurred we conducted the following analysis during denitrification no3 n is transformed into n2 or n2o under the action of microorganisms and is an important self purification process of groundwater that causes the accumulation of residual nitrate δ 15n and δ 18o therefore determining the occurrence of denitrification is an important premise for identifying the source of nitrate contamination nisi et al 2013 the groundwater do values can also be used to assess denitriﬁcation when the do concentration exceeded 2 mg l 1 the denitriﬁcation eﬀect could be neglected fadhullah et al 2019 if denitrification occurs higher δ 15n values and lower no3 n concentrations will occur c y zhang et al 2004 zhou and jiang 2007 previous research reported that microbial denitrification increases the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 values of water samples decreases the nitrate concentration and produces δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 ratios of 1 3 2 1 1 nikolenko et al 2018 panno et al 2006 the δ 15n no3 and δ 18o no3 of groundwater exhibited significant negative relationships fig 3 indicating that the samples form weifang did not undergo denitrification li et al 2013b 2019 wang et al 2016 yue et al 2014 as shown in fig 4 the relationship between ln no3 cl and δ 15n no3 was not negative and denitriﬁcation could be ignored yin et al 2020 overall denitrification was weak and could be ignored in this study theoretically one third of no3 produced by microbial nitrification originates from atmospheric o2 and two thirds originate from h2o o the δ 18o no3 values due to microbial nitrification could be expressed by eq 6 durka et al 1994 li et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 6 δ 18 o nitrate 2 3 δ 18 o water 1 3 δ 18 o air where the δ 18o value from atmospheric o2 is 23 5 and δ 18o value is measured from the h2o o2 the theoretical δ 18o no3 values calculated from nitrification were approximately 2 ogrinc et al 2019 δ 18o no3 values in the range of 5 15 can be considered as nitrification kendall 2007 yue et al 2014 as shown in fig 5 the values of approximately half of the samples were near the theoretical value kendall 1998 suggesting the predominance of the nitriﬁcation process in the groundwater of weifang the δ 18o no3 values of some samples were lighter than the theoretical value which may be attributed to the exchange of oxygen atoms between water and nitrate kool et al 2011 the δ 18o no3 values of some samples exceeded the theoretical value which might be due to the influence of atmospheric sources kendall 2007 yue et al 2014 therefore denitrification was further supported which was not the main factor and the influence of denitrification fractionation could be ignored in this study 4 3 proportional contributions of the source a bayesian mixing model was used to estimate the proportional contribution of groundwater nitrate sources in weifang two isotopes j 2 δ 15n and δ 18o and four sources k 4 cf sn m s and ad were considered as ammonium fertilizer had a weak impact on the nitrate source which was not included furthermore the effect of denitrification could be ignored and the fractionation factor cjk was set to 0 the proportional contribution fig 6 decreased in the following order m s 65 09 sn 17 97 ad 9 32 cf 7 63 it was surprising that sewage and manure constituted the highest proportion of groundwater nitrate in weifang more manure is used in actual production part of the water samples are collected from places affected by man made activities which is closely related to the high contribution proportion of m s the proportional contribution of sn was high which was attributed to the several years of planting that led to the persistent contamination of nitrates and high nitrate content in soil the proportional contribution of contaminant sources under different land use types was ranked as follows m s sn cf ad dw m s 52 99 sn 28 16 cf 11 04 ad 7 80 vg m s 31 02 sn 28 64 cf 23 19 ad 17 15 ww m s 44 63 sn 28 78 cf 15 99 ad 10 60 compared with dw the contribution of m s is lower and the contribution of chemical fertilizer is higher in ww which is related to the application of chemical fertilizer in pursuit of high yield and less pollution from domestic sewage and manure in ww the proportional contribution of different sources of nitrate was not significantly different in vg which may have been due to the large amount of fertilizer and manure used in intensive planting resulting in a higher proportion of fertilizers than other types in fig 6 major source of nitrate in dw and ww was manure and septic waste m s and there is no big difference of sources of sn and m s in vg as recharge rate of groundwater is different in dw ww and vg it indicates more sn has not leached to groundwater in dw and ww however more sn leached to groundwater in vg because of the larger irrigation and larger fertilizer application level in vg than other land use types therefore nitrate pollution of vg is more serious than dw and ww which is consistent with the previous conclusion according to the siar model results the use of manure and discharge of sewage should be reduced in weifang to quickly reduce the level of nitrate contamination 5 conclusions in this study we traced the sources and transformation of nitrate from groundwater in weifang from the stable isotopes of nitrate and hydro chemical compositions of groundwater and quantified the proportional contributions of the nitrate sources using a bayesian isotope mixing model the cross plot of δ 15n no3 and δ 18 o no3 showed that cf sn and m s were the main nitrate source nitrification was the main process in the study area and the effect of denitrification can be ignored the proportional contribution of each source was ranked as follows m s 65 09 sn 17 97 ad 9 32 cf 7 63 based on the comparison of the nitrate concentrations of groundwater in weifang during 2009 and 2019 we found that the concentration of nitrates in groundwater generally decreased indicating that the quality of groundwater improved significantly and depended on the local government making correct decisions and good environmental awareness as the nitrate concentration of drinking water was lower than that of irrigation water the quality of drinking water was ensured under different land use types the groundwater nitrate concentration was ranked as follows vg ww dw the nitrogen cycle was accompanied by complex fractionation which affected the accuracy of tracing future research should carefully analyze fractionation to ensure accurate results in this study the source of groundwater nitrate was determined and a theoretical basis for effective management and control of nitrate inputs was provided considering the characteristics of the intensive planting area improved manure utilization efficiency is necessary for the sustainable development of local agriculture declaration of competing interest the authors

combined with a soil water balance model to simulate et partitioning soil water content in 0 200 cm layer seasonal et calculated with soil water balance model and directly measured understorey et were used to validate the model results showed that the root mean square error nrmse for simulated soil water content ranged from 7 3 to 10 1 and nrmse for simulated total et and understorey et were only 3 9 and 4 2 respectively transpiration of apple tree in gc and lc was reduced by 21 3 32 5 and 12 3 24 2 after applying agroforestry the reduction was mainly attributed to the decrease in soil water content planting cocksfoot also reduced soil evaporation by 21 5 27 6 total et in the agroforestry was only changed by 4 9 6 7 compared to ct scenario simulation indicated that the negative effects of cocksfoot on apple tree transpiration linearly decreased with increase of the maximum lai of apple tree and exponentially increased with the increase of strip width of cocksfoot an 18 year simulation showed that gc and lc reduced the transpiration of apple tree by 7 3 and 2 1 respectively but did not accelerate soil water depletion in the deep soil layers therefore agroforestry with well managed understorey grain or cover crops is encouraged to be applied in our study area to increase the production and provide ecological services water transportation model developed in this study could also be used to evaluate water use and improve the design and management of other agroforestry systems keywords multi source et model shuttleworth wallace model agroforestry soil water content water partitioning 1 introduction agroforestry is practiced worldwide because it provides the opportunity of improving production and increasing biodiversity in forest and agriculture systems jackson and wallace 1999 leroy et al 2009 garcia et al 2018 many kinds of agroforestry systems with different understorey grain crops forage crops or cover crops are applied in different regions of china for example cotton and wheat are planted within jujube and walnut orchards to improve land production and mitigate wind erosion in irrigated farming region of northwest china liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 fodder oilseed rape and soybean are planted in jujube and apple orchards to prevent soil erosion and increase production on the semi arid loess plateau ling et al 2017 cover crops such as cocksfoot and erect milk vetch were also used on the loess plateau mainly to improve soil quality and prevent soil erosion du et al 2015 wang et al 2019 land use advantage of multiple systems is largely affected by resources availability and the competition and or complementation on resources use between different species smith et al 2012 george et al 2013 wang et al 2020 irrational design of agroforestry system may result in severe interspecific competition and the failure of the tree species ripoche et al 2010 understanding of evapotranspiration et and soil water balance processes is essential for optimizing agroforestry and improving water use efficiency in water limited environments effects of planting crops on water use pattern and soil water conditions in forest systems were different under different environmental conditions studies conducted in humid and sub humid environment indicated that cover crops in orchards could significantly increase infiltration and decrease soil and water loss for example hernández et al 2005 reported that the subterranean clover cover crop in olive orchards was a beneficial way of conserving more available soil water and the covers did not compete or scarcely competed soil water with the trees siczek and lipiec 2011 reported that organic mulching promoted soil micro organisms activity and the formation of a soil aggregate structure thereby improved the soil structure and soil water content in semi arid environments however different effects of agroforestry on soil moisture conditions were reported du et al 2015 found that intercropping milk vetch in apricot orchard reduced soil moisture and nutrients however the study of bai et al 2016 and ling et al 2017 demonstrated the positive effects of planting cover crops on soil water content in economic forests in fact water competition between tree and crops in agroforestry is affected by many factors such as plant species canopy structure and rainfall distribution the interspecific competition could be alleviated by appropriate design and management of the planting system leroy et al 2009 cao et al 2021 for example interspecific competition in a jujube and cotton agroforestry system was alleviated by reducing the planting density of cotton plant zhang et al 2014 and increasing the distance between the border of cotton strip and the tree row wang et al 2017 another study showed that water use and interspecific water competition was greatly reduced by improving the mowing frequency of cover crop in a 2 year old sangiovese vineyard centinari et al 2013 however mechanisms underlying et partitioning and soil water transportation in agroforestry are still not very clear especially in rainfed and water limited environments which deserve further investigation in field experiment et in agroforestry can be estimated using soil water balance method with the measured soil water content in root layer the component of soil evaporation can be measured directly using micro lysimeters jackson and wallace 1999 wallace et al 1999 however the measurements of transpiration especially that of crop species is difficult and inaccurate due to instrument limitations tournebize et al 1996 gao et al 2013 therefore the partitioning of et among tree crops and soil in agroforestry systems is still a difficult job in field operation theoretical modeling would provide us an efficient way to quantify et under different canopy and weather conditions and help us improving the planting system several models are available for simulating et under different canopy conditions the well known penman monteith model used an electrical resistance analogy to calculate the sensible and latent heat fluxes from a canopy or soil in which the latent heat fluxes are resisted by the aerodynamic and canopy resistances monteith 1965 however a problem with the penman monteith model is that water loss by evaporation is assumed to occur either from the soil or canopy only but not both simultaneously to address this problem shuttleworth and wallace 1985 extended the penman monteith model to include water loss from both soil and canopy and allowing interaction to occur between them soil evaporation is resisted by a soil surface resistance and an aerodynamic resistance before it reaching the mean canopy flow layer transpiration from plant canopy is resisted by the stomatal resistance and boundary layer resistance before it mixing with soil evaporation in the mean canopy flow layer and then the et transports to the reference layer after breaking the aerodynamic resistance between the mean canopy flow and reference layers to simulate et and its partitioning in intercropping systems the shuttleworth wallace model was further extended by wallace 1997 to include the transpiration from multiple crop species and evaporation from the soil this multi source et model was applied and validated with good accuracy for several intercropping systems teh et al 2001 gao et al 2013 however it might not be suitable for agroforestry et partitioning in agroforestry is determined by interspecific interactions above and below ground ozier lafontaine et al 1998 under the ground water partitioning depends on available soil water root growth and density and root water uptake capacity however the multi source et model did not consider the discrepancy of tree and crop species in root distribution and water uptake in the above ground space meteorological conditions and spatial and temporal distribution of plant canopy determine the water demand of agroforestry components tournebize et al 1996 the multisource et model determines the mean canopy flow layer according to the taller species which would lead to an underestimation of the boundary layer resistance for the understorey crop when the crop is far shorter than tree in addition aerodynamic resistance for soil evaporation would also be underestimated when the coverage of tree is very low while that of the understorey crop is relatively large to better simulate water use processes in the agroforestry systems the multi source et model need to be improved by taking the heterogeneity of canopy and root system into account therefore the objectives of this research were i to quantify soil water content understorey et including soil evaporation and understorey transpiration and system total et in apple tree and cocksfoot agroforestry system ii to develop an agroforestry et model by modifying the multi source et model and considering the interaction of et and soil water content iii to analyze et and et partitioning in the apple orchard with assistance of the validated model and iv to simulate the effects canopy structure and long term application of agroforestry on the et and soil water dynamics in the apple orchard 2 materials and methods 2 1 model development 2 1 1 radiation partitioning table in the appendix lists the definition and units of

multi source model erin evaporation and radiation interception by neighboring plants is a model developed by wallace 1997 for quantifying radiation and water partitioning in intercropping systems in which plants transpiration and soil evaporation are calculated using a multi source et model that developed from the shuttleworth wallace model a dual source et model the multi source model was applied and improved in this study to simulate water transportation processes in agroforestry systems with tall apple tree and short cocksfoot canopies fig 1 shows latent heat fluxes and resistances network in a two crop intercropping system as described by the multi source et model wallace 1997 crop 1 and crop 2 are assumed to be the dominant and subdominant crops respectively latent heat of evaporation for crop 1 λe 1 crop 2 λe 2 and soil λe s are assumed to be transporting from evaporation surface to the mean canopy flow a level somewhere along the plant height which acts as a momentum sink and then to the reference height x m the level of mean canopy flow is the sum of zero displacement plane d m and roughness of the canopy z 0 m which is determined according to the taller dominant

source model did not match with the observed data in the apple tree and cocksfoot agroforestry in our experiment specifically transpiration of apple tree was underestimated while the understorey et was greatly overestimated we found that the main reason contributed the mistakes was the inaccurate estimation of the resistances for the water evaporation from understorey crop and soil in the original multi source model it is assumed that the level of mean canopy flow is calculated according to the dominant species crop 1 and water vapor from the subdominant crop 2 is directly reaching the mean canopy flow layer after breaking through the resistances rs c2 and ra c2 fig 1 however when it is applied in agroforestry the crop 2 crop is much shorter than crop 1 tree there would be a large vertical distance from mean canopy flow of crop canopy to that of the tree canopy fig 2 before reaching the mean canopy flow of tree canopy the evaporation from understorey crop was resisted not only by the stomatal resistance r s c and boundary layer resistance r a c but also by the aerodynamic resistance between those two mean canopy flow levels r a a c for soil evaporation occurred on the bare strip the aerodynamic resistance between the soil surface and mean canopy flow of tree canopy is r a s t but for the soil evaporation occurred under crop strip the aerodynamic resistance should be the sum of r a s c and r a a c therefore in the improved multi source model calculation procedures in the original model was strictly followed resistance parameters for crop 1 r s c1 r a c1 r a s and r a

2 cm layer and the other 74 was depleted from the 2 100 cm layer van keulen 1975 according to field investigation roots of cocksfoot were mainly distributed in 0 100 cm layer so we supposed that all of the transpiration of cocksfoot occurred in the 0 100 cm layer for apple tree 65 19 and 16 of the transpiration occurred in the 2 100 100 200 and 200 300 cm layers respectively soil water storage in

and 2018 in an apple orchard in the qingyang experimental station of lanzhou university 35º40 n 107º51 e and 1297 m a s l which is located in the east of gansu province and in central part of the loess plateau the site has a semiarid climate with long term mean annual temperature of 9 2 c and mean annual precipitation of 527 6 mm the average annual sunshine duration is 2415 h meteorological data were recorded by an onsite agriculture meteorological station fig 3 shows the distribution of rainfall air temperature and solar radiation during growing season of apple tree in 2016 2017 and 2018 at the experimental site total seasonal rainfall in 2016 was 397 2 mm far less than the long term value of 480 2 mm in comparison seasonal rainfall in 2017 and 2018 were 635 3 and 556 2 mm respectively much more than the long term value however most of rainfall in 2017 occurred in the late season the rainfall in 2018 was more evenly distributed soil at the site is silty loam with a silt content of 73 80 and bulk density of 1 35 1 43 g cm 3 in the 0 300 cm layer the mean volumetric soil water content at saturation field capacity and wilting point in the 0 300 cm soil layer are 0 46 0

the experiment with trunk diameter ranged between 150 and 190 mm the tree crowns were 3 0 3 6 m in height and 3 2 4 1 m in width because of the uneven size of apple trees we recorded the bottom trunk diameter distribution of the apple trees and selected representative trees to conduct measurements three plots including six 20 meter long tree rows were built to implement different floor treatments and three representative apple trees were selected in each plot the floor was treated as 1 apple tree monoculture with clean tillage ct 2 agroforestry with 2 4 meter wide cocksfoot strips between tree rows and cocksfoot was harvested frequently to maintain a low coverage lc cocksfoot was harvested 4 5 times during the season and agroforestry with cocksfoot of a greater coverage gc cocksfoot was harvested 2 3 times cocksfoot was sown between the tree row in the july of 2014 with the strip width of 2 4 m and the distance from the cocksfoot strip border to tree row is 0 8 m leaf area index lai of apple tree was measured with an lai 2000 plant canopy analyzer li cor lincoln ne usa measurements under tree were made at the level about 5 cm above cocksfoot and the values of 10 measurements distributed over the 4 4 m2 area under a certain tree were averaged to represent a replicate of lai cocksfoot in the agroforestry was sampled every 15 20 days with a quadrat of 1 0 1 0 m2 the fresh weight was determined firstly and then some plants were subsampled to determine lai the subsample was weighted and the leaf area was measured with a leaf area meter am200 adc uk lai of cocksfoot was calculated as the area of the subsample times the ratio of the total fresh weight to subsample fresh weight and then divided by sampled ground area soil water content was measured using the oven drying method at 10 cm intervals to a depth of 300 cm at the beginning and end of the apple tree growing season in the growing season soil water content was measured approximately every 30 days to the depth of 200 cm for every measurement under a tree soil at four positions namely 1 0 m and 2 0 m from the tree trunk on both row and cross row direction were sampled seasonal et under each treatment was estimated by analyzing the water balance in the 0 300 cm soil layer 30 e t p e δ s c r p r where p e is the effective precipitation mm which is calculated using an empirical equation developed by

experimental site has a flat topography cr capillary rise mm was neglected since the underground water at the site was below 50 m and capillary rise rarely occurred and p deep percolation mm at the 300 cm depth level which was also neglected since our previous study showed that rainfall water rarely infiltrated to the depth of 300 cm in our study site cao et al 2021 micro lysimeter ml were used to measure soil evaporation and cocksfoot evapotranspiration ml1 was constructed using polyvinyl chloride pvc tube with a length of 150 mm and an internal diameter of 110 mm which was used to measure soil evaporation ml2 was also constructed using polyvinyl chloride pvc tube but was much larger than ml1 with the length of 300 mm and internal diameter of 250 mm which was used to measure evapotranspiration of cocksfoot six ml1 were placed under the selected tree in the ct and two ml1 on the bare path and four ml2 on the cocksfoot strip were placed in the agroforestry systems when installing the ml the ml was slowly hammered into the field to be filled with undisturbed soil and then put it into a larger steel tube which was installed in the field position prior to keep the soil moisture within the ml similar to the surrounding soil the soil in the ml was replaced every 5 days or immediately after rainfall zhao et al 2015 cao et al 2021 mls were weighed using a portable electronic balance at about 7 00 am each day and daily evaporation was calculated from the weight loss of the mls 2 3 model validation and simulation analysis the statistical indices mean bias error

model validation seasonal dynamics of daily transpiration of apple tree under different planting systems were compared and et partitioning among apple tree cocksfoot and soil were calculated then the effect of apple tree canopy structure and cocksfoot strip design on apple tree transpiration in agroforestry was analyzed and finally the long term effects of applying agroforestry and cocksfoot cutting management on apple tree transpiration and soil water dynamics in 0 300 cm layer were evaluated 3 results 3 1 canopy development lai of apple tree was very low and had a great spatial variation values in the three floor treatments were not significantly different from each other on most of the dates so the lai data in different treatments were pooled together to show the lai dynamics of the apple tree in the 3 years fig 4a c the buds of apple tree started to burst during late march every year lai increased quickly and reached the maximum values around 90 days after bud burst after that the lai maintained a relatively steady value toward the end of the season logistic equation was applied to describe the lai dynamics of apple tree and the fitted curves were also presented in the figure the fitted maximum values of lai were 1 59 1 29 and 1 25 m2 m 2 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 4d f show the lai dynamics of cocksfoot within the apple orchard in the three seasons the values were set as the ratio of total leaf area to land area occupied by cocksfoot strip the leaf of cocksfoot expanded quickly during the early growth after each harvest and the expansion rate slowed down after about 30 40 days after harvest the overall growth rate in 2016 and 2018 were greater than that in 2017 more frequent harvest significantly reduced the coverage of cocksfoot seasonal average lai in the lc and gc treatments were 2 8 and 4 3 m2 m 2 respectively in 2016 2 4 and 3 7 m2 m 2 in 2017 and 2 0 and 2 7 m2 m 2 in 2018 3 2 model validation fig 5 shows the simulated soil water content dynamics in 0 100 and 100 200 cm layers under gc and the comparison with measured values rainfall during the growing season was very limited in 2016 soil water content showed an overall reduction tendency especially in the 100 200 cm layer soil water content during the early and middle season in 2017 also maintained low values however it was fully replenished by the heavy rainfall occurred in the last 2 months in the season in 2018 rainfall was abundant in the middle season but the late season was also very dry soil water content in both layers were depleted to very low values at the end of the season we can see that the measured values matched the corresponding simulated values very well for most of the instances the simulated soil water dynamics reflected the real changes in soil water condition it seems that the model performed better in 2018 than in previous 2 years raising and decreasing trends in soil water content were all accurately simulated root mean square error rmse of the simulated soil water content in 0 100 and 100 200 cm layer are all 0 012 cm3 cm 3 and the mean bias error mbe were only 0 003 and 0 008 cm3 cm 3 for the two layers respectively normalized root mean square error nrmse and normalized mean bias error nmbe ranged from 5 8 to 6 1 and 1 6 to 3 9 respectively in 2016 and 2017 some very low values in the dry period and very high values after heavy rainfall was not well estimated the rmse and mbe of simulation were in the ranges of 0 014 0 020 and 0 017 0 006 cm3 cm 3 respectively and nrmse and nmbe were in the ranges of 7 3 11 0 and 9 2 2 8 respectively the scatter plots in fig 6 show the comparison of simulated against measured soil water content in 0 100 and 100 200 cm layers under different floor treatments in the three seasons we can see that the model showed satisfactory performance under all of the planting systems with all points distributed closely to the 1 1 lines root mean square error rmse of the simulated soil water content for the 0 100 cm soil layer ranged between 0 017 and 0 022 cm3 cm 3 and normalized root mean square error nrmse ranged between 8 9 and 10 1 rmse and nrmse of simulation for the 100 200 cm layer ranged from 0 015 to 0 019 cm3 cm 3 and from 7 3 to 9 2 respectively lower than the values in the up layer mbe in all of the plots were negative ranged from 0 011 to 0 003 and the nmbe ranged from 5 1 to 1 4 r2 values of the simulation ranged between 0 66 and 0 84 the scatter plots in fig 7 show the comparison of simulated against measured seasonal et in the three seasons we can see that the scattered points also distributed closely along the 1 1 lines so both the total et and understorey et were well simulated after a close inspection we found that total et in 2016 was overestimated while that in the 2017 and 2018 were more accurately modeled the understorey et in the clean tillage soil evaporation were better simulated while that in the agroforestry systems soil evaporation cocksfoot transpiration was generally slightly overestimated statistical results showed that rmse of the simulated total and understorey et were 18 9 and 11 3 mm respectively with the nrmse values of 3 9 and 4 2 the mbe of the simulation were much lower than the rmse with values of 5 1 and 3 6 mm for the total and understorey et respectively corresponding nmbe values were 1 1 and 1 3 3 3 et partitioning with the validated model we evaluated the effects of planting cocksfoot and the cocksfoot cutting frequency on the transpiration of apple tree fig 8 shows the transpiration of apple tree under different treatments in the three seasons firstly we can see that the tree transpiration was largely reduced after intercropping cocksfoot and it was very pronounced in the early and middle seasons in 2016 and 2017 seasonal total transpiration of apple tree under ct was 250 5 226 4 and 281 8 mm in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively which were 29 6 32 4 and 21 3 greater than that in gc secondly increasing cutting frequency of cocksfoot apparently reduced the negative effects of planting cocksfoot on apple tree transpiration specifically those values under lc were 7 7 12 6 and 11 5 greater than that in gc in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively as the lai of apple tree was not significantly different in ct and agroforestry systems water transporting resistances for apple tree including stomatal boundary and aerodynamic resistances were also not theoretically different in the two systems therefore reduction of apple tree transpiration in agroforestry were mainly attributed to reduction of the root zone soil water content and increase of the vapor pressure deficit at the mean canopy flow layer a further inspection of the simulated data indicated that the reduction in soil water content was the main factor restricting water uptake of apple tree in agroforestry fig 9 in the 12 3 32 4 reduction of apple tree transpiration in different agroforestry systems in the 3 years 10 6 30 4 were resulted from the reduction in root zone soil water content and only 1 7 2 7 were resulted from the increase in vapor pressure deficit fig 10 shows the et partitioning in different planting systems in the 3 years apart from transpiration of apple tree soil evaporation in the agroforestry was also greatly reduced compared that in clean tilled orchard the reduction of evaporation in gc and lc were 22 7 and 21 5 respectively in 2016 were 24 1 and 27 5 in 2017 and were 25 4 and 24 8 in 2018 transpiration of cocksfoot in gc and lc were 113 4 and 99 4 mm respectively in 2016 and were 106 1 and 103 9 mm in 2017 and were 136 6 and 130 6 mm in 2018 total transpiration sum of transpiration of apple tree and cocksfoot in gc and lc were also greatly increased the increments were 15 6 and 15 4 in gc and lc respectively in 2016 were 14 4 and 22 0 in 2017 and were 27 7 and 34 0 in 2018 total system et in agroforestry was reduced by 2 2 4 9 compared to ct in 2016 and 2017 and was increased by 2 7 6 7 in 2018 3 4 scenario simulation canopy parameters of different aged apple orchards were derived from another study also conducted in rain fed orchards on the loess plateau wang et al 2010 which are listed in table 1 the trees in those orchards are all planted with an inter row distance of 5 0 m and an intra row distance of 4 0 m and the tree crown structure is very similar with that in our experiment the temporal dynamics of lai for those orchards were also described with logistic curves since the maximum values of lai were known and the initial values were supposed to be 0 15 and the growth stages were set to be the same as in our study in the scenario simulation input parameters related to canopy characteristics such as lai and plant height were calculated according to the data we derived above other parameters were set the same as in model development we should note that our validated model might not be suitable for orchards of different tree arrangement and canopy structure directly applying the uncalibrated parameters as in model development might results in system errors in the simulated results the scenario simulation here we mainly concern the inter comparison of different planting patterns so the simulated results are still indicative lai data of cocksfoot in 2016 the dry year and 2018 the normal year were used to evaluate the effects of tree canopy size on water use in agroforestry fig 11a and b we can see that with increasing of the age and coverage of apple tree the negative effect of cocksfoot on apple tree transpiration decreased in both of the dry and normal years reduction of tree transpiration was linearly related with the maximum lai of apple tree reduction magnitude in lc was accordingly lower than that in gc reduction magnitude and slope of the regression line in the normal season was much lower than that in the dry season lai data of apple tree in 2016 and 2018 were used to evaluate the effects of the width of cocksfoot strip on the transpiration of apple tree fig 11c and d lai of cocksfoot under gc and lc were also used by supposing that the lai of cocksfoot based on the area of cocksfoot strip remained stable so the coverage area and the lai based on the whole orchard increased with the increasing of strip width we can see that the reduction of apple tree transpiration increased with the strip width quickly when the width was less than 2 0 m and slowed down thereafter relationship between the reduction and the strip width of cocksfoot fitted well with exponential equations lc also showed weaker reduction effects than gc difference between lc and gc was more apparent in the normal season than that in the dry season canopy information of different aged apple tree table 1 and canopy information of cocksfoot in 2016 were used to simulating the long term effects 18 year simulation from 2001 to 2018 of agroforestry on et partitioning and soil water dynamics in apple orchard for the age with no tree canopy information the information of nearest greater aged tree was used for example 9 year aged tree used the canopy information of 10 year aged tree fig 12 shows the transpiration of apple tree and cocksfoot in the 18 years we can see that apple tree in ct showed larger amount of transpiration than those in gc and ct in the early ages during 2001 2008 however the maximum lai of apple tree was greater than 2 0 m2 m 2 thereafter transpiration of apple tree was not apparently restricted by the existing of cocksfoot the transpiration in lc was even greater than that in ct after 2008 except for the year 2009 and the transpiration in gc was lower than that in lc in all of the years in this period total transpiration of apple tree in the 18 years was 3709 7 mm in ct 3437 8 and 3630 7 mm in gc and lc respectively 7 3 and 2 1 lower than that in ct transpiration of cocksfoot decreased as apple tree growing up maintained a relatively stable value after 2007 and the total transpiration in the gc was 17 5 greater than that in the lc fig 13 shows the simulated dynamics of soil water content in 0 100 100 200 and 200 300 cm soil layer during 2001 2018 soil water content in the 0 100 cm layer fluctuated greatly only in the early several years could we find differences among the treatments in the below layers downward tendency in soil water content dynamics was found under all of the treatments soil water content under gc and lc was lower than that under ct in most years the differences were very large during the early ages of apple tree however we can see that soil water content at the end of 2018 was not greatly different among the treatments indicating that agroforestry did not accelerate soil water depletion in the apple orchard soil water drainage out of the 0 300 cm layer was 550 4 626 6 and 799 9 mm under gc lc and ct respectively 4 discussion an improvement of the multi source et model was provided in this study the original multi source model developed by wallace 1997 is robust for modeling et partitioning in intercropping systems especially those systems in which the component species have comparable height and the dominant crop has a greater coverage such as maize sorghum intercropping teh et al 2001 and maize soybean intercropping gao et al 2013 however when the dominant species is much higher and or has a lower coverage than the subdominant species as those cases in agroforestry the model would result in large error in simulation after considering the effects of canopy structure on understorey crop transpiration and soil evaporation resistances calculation in the multi source modeling was improved we illustrated the difference between transpiration partitioning simulated by the original and improved et models as influenced by canopy structure of agroforestry system in fig 14 in fig 14a it was assumed that the understorey crop had a stable lai of 3 0 m2 m 2 and lai of tree increased gradually plant height of tree and crop species were 4 0 and 0 2 m respectively we can see that the transpiration of the understorey crop was greatly reduced in the improved model especially when the lai of tree was relatively low while the transpiration of tree was increased in fig 14b lai of both tree and crop species were assumed to be 3 0 m2 m 2 plant height of the apple tree was set to be 4 0 m and that of the crop species increased gradually we can see that as plant height of the crop species increased difference between the crop transpiration simulated by the original and improved model reduced and difference between the tree transpiration simulated by the two model was also narrowed therefore the improved multi source model well depicted the canopy interaction of component species on transpiration partitioning in the multi species systems it could be applied in agroforestry systems as well as intercropping systems of heterogeneously structured canopy in addition the et model was combined with a mechanistic soil water transporting model the effects of root distribution and soil moisture on et partitioning in agroforestry was considered followed the study of celette et al 2010 a representation of the crop soil system in two dimensions with two separate soil compartments was presented roots of crop species in agroforestry distributed near the surface under the inter row soil water in this area was depleted by both tree and crop species while tree species has a deeper root system and the soil water in the deeper layers was used by tree species only soil water status and et partitioning were coupled together and affected each other every day this model can also present the widely concerned information about water status in deep soil layer validation showed that model well depicted the soil water dynamics and et in agroforestry systems in all the 3 years but the performance was better in 2018 when the rainfall distribution was more even throughout the season this might due to that several parameters such as soil resistance r s s and stomatal resistance of plants r s c were all related to soil water content by empirical equations these equations might fit better under moderate soil water conditions measurable model inputs are critical for the practical applicability of a model malezieux et al 2008 the model developed in this study could be applied based on measurements of parameters describing the canopy structure of agroforestry lai strip widths plant heights radiation extinction coefficient of component species commonly used soil hydraulic parameters and location and weather data the easily accessible parameters insured the practical applicability of the model but some parameters relating to the calculation of water transporting resistances such as the attenuation coefficient for eddy diffusivity n the mean boundary layer resistance r b and the mean stomatal resistance r st are difficult to be measured we used the default values suggested by shuttleworth and wallace 1985 choudhury and monteith 1988 shuttleworth and gurney 1990 teh 2006 and other multi source et model users in this study however the value for some parameters such as 2 5 for eddy diffusivity attenuation coefficient was suggested for agricultural crops direct applying it in apple tree canopy may lead to errors although we obtained satisfactory results in model validation and some other authors also applied the suggested parameters in modeling the et of fruit trees zhao et al 2015 a model parameterization would give more reliable value for uncertain parameters in a different environment with different canopy structure the model parameters should be reparametrized to closely represent the reality in scenario analysis in this study we used the same parameters as in model development which might also lead to system errors because tree species have distinct canopy structures which would contribute to different effects on water transportation processes so it was suggested to calibrate the key parameters relating to resistances calculation in using the model developed in this study in our field experiment total system et was not significantly different in the sole and agroforestry systems but transpiration of apple tree was severely restricted in the agroforestry systems especially in 2016 and 2017 when the rainfall was limited and unevenly distributed lai of apple tree was relatively low in this study the maximum values were less than 2 0 m2 m 2 in all of the three seasons low coverage of apple tree made more energy was available to cocksfoot which increased the water use of cocksfoot and reduced soil water content in the 0 100 cm soil layer approximately 65 of apple tree roots were distributed in this layer so the apple tree transpiration was largely affected another factor contributed to the reduction of apple tree transpiration was the decrease of vapor pressure deficit at mean canopy flow level as demonstrated by wallace 1997 effects of understorey species on vapor pressure deficit would be very significant when water was fully applied soil water was mostly deficit in this study so the contribution of vpd decrease to the reduction of apple tree transpiration was relatively low planting cocksfoot increased the overall coverage of apple orchard so soil evaporation was greatly cut down it can be concluded that the water transpired by cocksfoot was transferred from the reduction of water consumed through apple tree transpiration and soil evaporation in terms of water productivity more water was used to produce biomass in the agroforestry so water was more efficiently used this is in accordance with other studies about agroforestry bai et al 2016 we found that production of apple tree was not significantly influenced after planting cocksfoot in 2016 and 2017 wang et al 2019 although transpiration in apple tree was largely reduced in fact soil water content in ct was also very low in the dry periods although it was greater than that in the gc and lc which indicated that apple tree in all of the systems was restricted in water uptake the effects of weather condition on apple tree water uptake and production might be greater than the effects of intercropping cocksfoot so the three systems behaved similar in apple production in addition apple production is affected by other conditions such as spring freeze injury disease and fruit management so reduction in transpiration showed little adverse effect on fruit production long term simulation indicated that planting cocksfoot has adverse effects on the water uptake of apple tree in the first 8 years of agroforestry although apple tree is competed and its growth and production might be affected by understorey crops during this period the benefits of well managed intercropping would surely offset this loss coverage of apple tree in early growth is low and lots of energy is transmitted to the soil surface clean tillage would cause the waste of energy and water celette et al 2005 abbas et al 2017 applying intercropping could conserve soil water reduce soil erosion risk and increase carbon sequestration du et al 2015 ling et al 2017 also the production of intercrops could increase farmers income in the later period apple tree grows up and maintains a greater coverage agroforestry shows very little restriction effects on the transpiration of apple tree especially in the lc treatment trees in lc showed the greatest transpiration in most of the years indicating that low coverage intercrop is the best way of conserving soil water reducing the coverage of understorey crop is essential in water limited conditions increasing cutting frequency is an efficient way for cover crops management centinari et al 2013 while reducing strip width is more practical for grain crops zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2017 therefore we suggest to apply agroforestry in apple orchards in our study area but the coverage and strip width of intercrops should be controlled to make good use of its productive and ecological services and mostly reduce its adverse effects on apple tree in other kinds of fruit orchards agroforestry is also a sustainable way design and management should be optimized based on further experiment and modeling work 5 conclusions this study provided an et and soil water balance simulating model for agroforestry system daily et et partitioning and soil water content in different layers could be simulated with given information about soil weather canopy structure root distribution and initial soil water content the model was validated with experiment data measured in an apple tree and cocksfoot agroforestry system dynamics of soil water content and et in under different weather conditions were well simulated transpiration of apple tree was reduced by 21 3 32 5 in agroforestry system of greater cocksfoot coverage increasing cutting frequency of cocksfoot could effectively reduce the adverse effects of agroforestry on apple tree an 18 year scenario simulation showed that agroforestry with greater and low coverage of cocksfoot reduced the apple tree transpiration by 7 3 and 2 1 respectively and only accelerated soil water depletion in the early several years when coverage of apple tree was low the water transportation model provided in this study could be validated and applied to evaluate water use mechanisms and improve the design and management in other agroforestry systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare

10116,how evapotranspiration et and its partitioning in agroforestry systems are influenced by canopy structure as well as soil water availability is not well explained modeling work was combined with field experiment in this study to investigate the interaction of et and soil water conditions in an apple tree malus pumila m and cocksfoot dactylis glomerata l agroforestry the experiment was conducted in 2016 2018 in an apple orchard at a spacing of 4 m 4 m on the loess plateau of china the three tested planting patterns were monoculture apple tree with clean tillage ct agroforestry with 2 4 meter wide cocksfoot strips between tree rows that harvested frequently to maintain a low coverage lc and agroforestry with cocksfoot of a greater coverage gc the multi source et model developed for intercropping system was improved by considering the effects of large height difference of different species in agroforestry on water vapor transporting resistances then the improved et model was combined with a soil water balance model to simulate et partitioning soil water content in 0 200 cm layer seasonal et calculated with soil water balance model and directly measured understorey et were used to validate the model results showed that the root mean square error nrmse for simulated soil water content ranged from 7 3 to 10 1 and nrmse for simulated total et and understorey et were only 3 9 and 4 2 respectively transpiration of apple tree in gc and lc was reduced by 21 3 32 5 and 12 3 24 2 after applying agroforestry the reduction was mainly attributed to the decrease in soil water content planting cocksfoot also reduced soil evaporation by 21 5 27 6 total et in the agroforestry was only changed by 4 9 6 7 compared to ct scenario simulation indicated that the negative effects of cocksfoot on apple tree transpiration linearly decreased with increase of the maximum lai of apple tree and exponentially increased with the increase of strip width of cocksfoot an 18 year simulation showed that gc and lc reduced the transpiration of apple tree by 7 3 and 2 1 respectively but did not accelerate soil water depletion in the deep soil layers therefore agroforestry with well managed understorey grain or cover crops is encouraged to be applied in our study area to increase the production and provide ecological services water transportation model developed in this study could also be used to evaluate water use and improve the design and management of other agroforestry systems keywords multi source et model shuttleworth wallace model agroforestry soil water content water partitioning 1 introduction agroforestry is practiced worldwide because it provides the opportunity of improving production and increasing biodiversity in forest and agriculture systems jackson and wallace 1999 leroy et al 2009 garcia et al 2018 many kinds of agroforestry systems with different understorey grain crops forage crops or cover crops are applied in different regions of china for example cotton and wheat are planted within jujube and walnut orchards to improve land production and mitigate wind erosion in irrigated farming region of northwest china liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 fodder oilseed rape and soybean are planted in jujube and apple orchards to prevent soil erosion and increase production on the semi arid loess plateau ling et al 2017 cover crops such as cocksfoot and erect milk vetch were also used on the loess plateau mainly to improve soil quality and prevent soil erosion du et al 2015 wang et al 2019 land use advantage of multiple systems is largely affected by resources availability and the competition and or complementation on resources use between different species smith et al 2012 george et al 2013 wang et al 2020 irrational design of agroforestry system may result in severe interspecific competition and the failure of the tree species ripoche et al 2010 understanding of evapotranspiration et and soil water balance processes is essential for optimizing agroforestry and improving water use efficiency in water limited environments effects of planting crops on water use pattern and soil water conditions in forest systems were different under different environmental conditions studies conducted in humid and sub humid environment indicated that cover crops in orchards could significantly increase infiltration and decrease soil and water loss for example hernández et al 2005 reported that the subterranean clover cover crop in olive orchards was a beneficial way of conserving more available soil water and the covers did not compete or scarcely competed soil water with the trees siczek and lipiec 2011 reported that organic mulching promoted soil micro organisms activity and the formation of a soil aggregate structure thereby improved the soil structure and soil water content in semi arid environments however different effects of agroforestry on soil moisture conditions were reported du et al 2015 found that intercropping milk vetch in apricot orchard reduced soil moisture and nutrients however the study of bai et al 2016 and ling et al 2017 demonstrated the positive effects of planting cover crops on soil water content in economic forests in fact water competition between tree and crops in agroforestry is affected by many factors such as plant species canopy structure and rainfall distribution the interspecific competition could be alleviated by appropriate design and management of the planting system leroy et al 2009 cao et al 2021 for example interspecific competition in a jujube and cotton agroforestry system was alleviated by reducing the planting density of cotton plant zhang et al 2014 and increasing the distance between the border of cotton strip and the tree row wang et al 2017 another study showed that water use and interspecific water competition was greatly reduced by improving the mowing frequency of cover crop in a 2 year old sangiovese vineyard centinari et al 2013 however mechanisms underlying et partitioning and soil water transportation in agroforestry are still not very clear especially in rainfed and water limited environments which deserve further investigation in field experiment et in agroforestry can be estimated using soil water balance method with the measured soil water content in root layer the component of soil evaporation can be measured directly using micro lysimeters jackson and wallace 1999 wallace et al 1999 however the measurements of transpiration especially that of crop species is difficult and inaccurate due to instrument limitations tournebize et al 1996 gao et al 2013 therefore the partitioning of et among tree crops and soil in agroforestry systems is still a difficult job in field operation theoretical modeling would provide us an efficient way to quantify et under different canopy and weather conditions and help us improving the planting system several models are available for simulating et under different canopy conditions the well known penman monteith model used an electrical resistance analogy to calculate the sensible and latent heat fluxes from a canopy or soil in which the latent heat fluxes are resisted by the aerodynamic and canopy resistances monteith 1965 however a problem with the penman monteith model is that water loss by evaporation is assumed to occur either from the soil or canopy only but not both simultaneously to address this problem shuttleworth and wallace 1985 extended the penman monteith model to include water loss from both soil and canopy and allowing interaction to occur between them soil evaporation is resisted by a soil surface resistance and an aerodynamic resistance before it reaching the mean canopy flow layer transpiration from plant canopy is resisted by the stomatal resistance and boundary layer resistance before it mixing with soil evaporation in the mean canopy flow layer and then the et transports to the reference layer after breaking the aerodynamic resistance between the mean canopy flow and reference layers to simulate et and its partitioning in intercropping systems the shuttleworth wallace model was further extended by wallace 1997 to include the transpiration from multiple crop species and evaporation from the soil this multi source et model was applied and validated with good accuracy for several intercropping systems teh et al 2001 gao et al 2013 however it might not be suitable for agroforestry et partitioning in agroforestry is determined by interspecific interactions above and below ground ozier lafontaine et al 1998 under the ground water partitioning depends on available soil water root growth and density and root water uptake capacity however the multi source et model did not consider the discrepancy of tree and crop species in root distribution and water uptake in the above ground space meteorological conditions and spatial and temporal distribution of plant canopy determine the water demand of agroforestry components tournebize et al 1996 the multisource et model determines the mean canopy flow layer according to the taller species which would lead to an underestimation of the boundary layer resistance for the understorey crop when the crop is far shorter than tree in addition aerodynamic resistance for soil evaporation would also be underestimated when the coverage of tree is very low while that of the understorey crop is relatively large to better simulate water use processes in the agroforestry systems the multi source et model need to be improved by taking the heterogeneity of canopy and root system into account therefore the objectives of this research were i to quantify soil water content understorey et including soil evaporation and understorey transpiration and system total et in apple tree and cocksfoot agroforestry system ii to develop an agroforestry et model by modifying the multi source et model and considering the interaction of et and soil water content iii to analyze et and et partitioning in the apple orchard with assistance of the validated model and iv to simulate the effects canopy structure and long term application of agroforestry on the et and soil water dynamics in the apple orchard 2 materials and methods 2 1 model development 2 1 1 radiation partitioning table in the appendix lists the definition and units of

multi source model erin evaporation and radiation interception by neighboring plants is a model developed by wallace 1997 for quantifying radiation and water partitioning in intercropping systems in which plants transpiration and soil evaporation are calculated using a multi source et model that developed from the shuttleworth wallace model a dual source et model the multi source model was applied and improved in this study to simulate water transportation processes in agroforestry systems with tall apple tree and short cocksfoot canopies fig 1 shows latent heat fluxes and resistances

evaporation for crop 1 λe 1 crop 2 λe 2 and soil λe s are assumed to be transporting from evaporation surface to the mean canopy flow a level somewhere along the plant height which acts as a momentum sink and then to the reference height x m the level of mean canopy flow is the sum of zero displacement plane d m and roughness of the canopy z 0 m which is determined according to the taller dominant

source model did not match with the observed data in the apple tree and cocksfoot agroforestry in our experiment specifically transpiration of apple tree was underestimated while the understorey et was greatly overestimated we found that the main reason contributed the mistakes was the inaccurate estimation of the resistances for the water evaporation from understorey crop and soil in the original multi source model it is assumed that the level of mean canopy flow is calculated according to the dominant species crop 1 and water vapor from the subdominant crop 2 is directly reaching the mean canopy flow layer after breaking through the resistances rs c2 and ra c2 fig 1 however when it is applied in agroforestry the crop 2 crop is much shorter than crop 1 tree there would be a large vertical distance from mean canopy flow of crop canopy to that of the tree canopy fig 2 before reaching the mean canopy flow of tree canopy the evaporation from understorey crop was resisted not only by the stomatal resistance r s c and boundary layer resistance r a c but also by the aerodynamic resistance between those two mean canopy flow levels r a a c for soil evaporation occurred on the bare strip the aerodynamic resistance between the soil surface and mean canopy flow of tree canopy is r a s t but for the soil evaporation occurred under crop strip the aerodynamic resistance should be the sum of r a s c and r a a c therefore in the improved multi source model calculation procedures in the original model was strictly followed resistance parameters for crop 1 r s c1 r a c1 r a s and r a

and 2018 in an apple orchard in the qingyang experimental station of lanzhou university 35º40 n 107º51 e and 1297 m a s l which is located in the east of gansu province and in central part of the loess plateau the site has a semiarid climate with long term mean annual temperature of 9 2 c and mean annual precipitation of 527 6 mm the average annual sunshine duration is 2415 h meteorological data were recorded by an onsite agriculture meteorological station fig 3 shows the distribution of rainfall air temperature and solar radiation during growing season of apple tree in 2016 2017 and 2018 at the experimental site total seasonal rainfall in 2016 was 397 2 mm far less than the long term value of 480 2 mm in comparison seasonal rainfall in 2017 and 2018 were 635 3 and 556 2 mm respectively much more than the long term value however most of rainfall in 2017 occurred in the late season the rainfall in 2018 was more evenly distributed soil at the site is silty loam with a silt

the experiment with trunk diameter ranged between 150 and 190 mm the tree crowns were 3 0 3 6 m in height and 3 2 4 1 m in width because of the uneven size of apple trees we recorded the bottom trunk diameter distribution of the apple trees and selected representative trees to conduct measurements three plots including six 20 meter long tree rows were built to implement different floor treatments and three representative apple trees were selected in each plot the floor was treated as 1 apple tree monoculture with clean tillage ct 2 agroforestry with 2 4 meter wide cocksfoot strips between tree rows and cocksfoot was harvested frequently to maintain a low coverage lc cocksfoot was harvested 4 5 times during the season and agroforestry with cocksfoot of a greater coverage gc cocksfoot was harvested 2 3 times cocksfoot was sown between the tree row in the july of 2014 with the strip width of 2 4 m and the distance from the cocksfoot strip border to tree row is 0 8 m leaf area index lai of apple tree was measured with an lai 2000 plant canopy analyzer li cor lincoln ne usa measurements under tree were made at the level about 5 cm above cocksfoot and the values of 10 measurements distributed over the 4 4 m2 area under a certain tree were averaged to represent a replicate of lai cocksfoot in the agroforestry was sampled every 15 20 days with a quadrat of 1 0 1 0 m2 the fresh weight was determined firstly and then some plants were subsampled to determine lai the subsample was weighted and the leaf area was measured with a leaf area meter am200 adc uk lai of cocksfoot was calculated as the area of the subsample times the ratio of the total fresh weight to subsample fresh weight and then divided by sampled ground area soil water content was measured using the oven drying method at 10 cm intervals to a depth of 300 cm at the beginning and end of the apple tree growing season in the growing season soil water content was measured approximately every 30 days to the depth of 200 cm for every measurement under a tree soil at four positions namely 1 0 m and 2 0 m from the tree trunk on both row and cross row direction were sampled seasonal et under each treatment

experimental site has a flat topography cr capillary rise mm was neglected since the underground water at the site was below 50 m and capillary rise rarely occurred and p deep percolation mm at the

to measure soil evaporation and cocksfoot evapotranspiration ml1 was constructed using polyvinyl chloride pvc tube with a length of 150 mm and an internal diameter of 110 mm which was used to measure soil evaporation ml2 was also constructed using polyvinyl chloride pvc tube but was much larger than ml1 with the length of 300 mm and internal diameter of 250 mm which was used to measure evapotranspiration of cocksfoot six ml1 were placed under the selected tree in the ct and two ml1 on the bare path and four ml2 on the cocksfoot strip were placed in the agroforestry systems when installing the ml the ml was slowly hammered into the field to be filled with undisturbed soil and then put it into a larger steel tube which was installed in the field position prior to keep the soil moisture within the ml similar to the surrounding soil the soil in the ml was replaced every 5 days or immediately after rainfall zhao et al 2015 cao et al 2021 mls were weighed using a portable electronic balance at about 7 00 am each day and daily evaporation was calculated from the weight loss of the mls 2 3 model validation and simulation analysis the statistical indices mean bias error

model validation seasonal dynamics of daily transpiration of apple tree under different planting systems were compared and et partitioning among apple tree cocksfoot and soil were calculated then the effect of apple tree canopy structure and cocksfoot strip design on apple tree transpiration in agroforestry was analyzed and finally the long term effects of applying agroforestry and cocksfoot cutting management on apple tree transpiration and soil water dynamics in 0 300 cm layer were evaluated 3 results 3 1 canopy development lai of apple tree was very low and had a great spatial variation values in the three floor treatments were not significantly different from each other on most of the dates so the lai data in different treatments were pooled together to show the lai dynamics of the apple tree in the 3 years fig 4a c the buds of apple tree started to burst during late march every year lai increased quickly and reached the maximum values around 90 days after bud burst after that the lai maintained a relatively steady value toward the end of the season logistic equation was applied to describe the lai dynamics of apple tree and the fitted curves were also presented in the figure the fitted maximum values of lai were 1 59 1 29 and 1 25 m2 m 2 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 4d f show the lai dynamics of cocksfoot within the apple orchard in the three seasons the values were set as the ratio of total leaf area to land area occupied by cocksfoot strip the leaf of cocksfoot expanded quickly during the early growth after each harvest and the expansion rate slowed down after about 30 40 days after harvest the overall growth rate in 2016 and 2018 were greater than that in 2017 more frequent harvest significantly reduced the coverage of cocksfoot seasonal average lai in the lc and gc treatments were 2 8 and 4 3 m2 m 2 respectively in 2016 2 4 and 3 7 m2 m 2 in 2017 and 2 0 and 2 7 m2 m 2 in 2018 3 2 model validation fig 5 shows the simulated soil water content dynamics in 0 100 and 100 200 cm layers under gc and the comparison with measured values rainfall during the growing season was very limited in 2016 soil water content showed an overall reduction tendency especially in the 100 200 cm layer soil water content during the early and middle season in 2017 also maintained low values however it was fully replenished by the heavy rainfall occurred in the last 2 months in the season in 2018 rainfall was abundant in the middle season but the late season was also very dry soil water content in both layers were depleted to very low values at the end of the season we can see that the measured values matched the corresponding simulated values very well for most of the instances the simulated soil water dynamics reflected the real changes in soil water condition it seems that the model performed better in 2018 than in previous 2 years raising and decreasing trends in soil water content were all accurately simulated root mean square error rmse of the simulated soil water content in 0 100 and 100 200 cm layer are all 0 012 cm3 cm 3 and the mean bias error mbe were only 0 003 and 0 008 cm3 cm 3 for the two layers respectively normalized root mean square error nrmse and normalized mean bias error nmbe ranged from 5 8 to 6 1 and 1 6 to 3 9 respectively in 2016 and 2017 some very low values in the dry period and very high values after heavy rainfall was not well estimated the rmse and mbe of simulation were in the ranges of 0 014 0 020 and 0 017 0 006 cm3 cm 3 respectively and nrmse and nmbe were in the ranges of 7 3 11 0 and 9 2 2 8 respectively the scatter plots in fig 6 show the comparison of simulated against measured soil water content in 0 100 and 100 200 cm layers under different floor treatments in the three seasons we can see that the model showed satisfactory performance under all of the planting systems with all points distributed closely to the 1 1 lines root mean square error rmse of the simulated soil water content for the 0 100 cm soil layer ranged between 0 017 and 0 022 cm3 cm 3 and normalized root mean square error nrmse ranged between 8 9 and 10 1 rmse and nrmse of simulation for the 100 200 cm layer ranged from 0 015 to 0 019 cm3 cm 3 and from 7 3 to 9 2 respectively lower than the values in the up layer mbe in all of the plots were negative ranged from 0 011 to 0 003 and the nmbe ranged from 5 1 to 1 4 r2 values of the simulation ranged between 0 66 and 0 84 the scatter plots in fig 7 show the comparison of simulated against measured seasonal et in the three seasons we can see that the scattered points also distributed closely along the 1 1 lines so both the total et and understorey et were well simulated after a close inspection we found that total et in 2016 was overestimated while that in the 2017 and 2018 were more accurately modeled the understorey et in the clean tillage soil evaporation were better simulated while that in the agroforestry systems soil evaporation cocksfoot transpiration was generally slightly overestimated statistical results showed that rmse of the simulated total and understorey et were 18 9 and 11 3 mm respectively with the nrmse values of 3 9 and 4 2 the mbe of the simulation were much lower than the rmse with values of 5 1 and 3 6 mm for the total and understorey et respectively corresponding nmbe values were 1 1 and 1 3 3 3 et partitioning with the validated model we evaluated the effects of planting cocksfoot and the cocksfoot cutting frequency on the transpiration of apple tree fig 8 shows the transpiration of apple tree under different treatments in the three seasons firstly we can see that the tree transpiration was largely reduced after intercropping cocksfoot and it was very pronounced in the early and middle seasons in 2016 and 2017 seasonal total transpiration of apple tree under ct was 250 5 226 4 and 281 8 mm in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively which were 29 6 32 4 and 21 3 greater than that in gc secondly increasing cutting frequency of cocksfoot apparently reduced the negative effects of planting cocksfoot on apple tree transpiration specifically those values under lc were 7 7 12 6 and 11 5 greater than that in gc in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively as the lai of apple tree was not significantly different in ct and agroforestry systems water transporting resistances for apple tree including stomatal boundary and aerodynamic resistances were also not theoretically different in the two systems therefore reduction of apple tree transpiration in agroforestry were mainly attributed to reduction of the root zone soil water content and increase of the vapor pressure deficit at the mean canopy flow layer a further inspection of the simulated data indicated that the reduction in soil water content was the main factor restricting water uptake of apple tree in agroforestry fig 9 in the 12 3 32 4 reduction of apple tree transpiration in different agroforestry systems in the 3 years 10 6 30 4 were resulted from the reduction in root zone soil water content and only 1 7 2 7 were resulted from the increase in vapor pressure deficit fig 10 shows the et partitioning in different planting systems in the 3 years apart from transpiration of apple tree soil evaporation in the agroforestry was also greatly reduced compared that in clean tilled orchard the reduction of evaporation in gc and lc were 22 7 and 21 5 respectively in 2016 were 24 1 and 27 5 in 2017 and were 25 4 and 24 8 in 2018 transpiration of cocksfoot in gc and lc were 113 4 and 99 4 mm respectively in 2016 and were 106 1 and 103 9 mm in 2017 and were 136 6 and 130 6 mm in 2018 total transpiration sum of transpiration of apple tree and cocksfoot in gc and lc were also greatly increased the increments were 15 6 and 15 4 in gc and lc respectively in 2016 were 14 4 and 22 0 in 2017 and were 27 7 and 34 0 in 2018 total system et in agroforestry was reduced by 2 2 4 9 compared to ct in 2016 and 2017 and was increased by 2 7 6 7 in 2018 3 4 scenario simulation canopy parameters of different aged apple orchards were derived from another study also conducted in rain fed orchards on the loess plateau wang et al 2010 which are listed in table 1 the trees in those orchards are all planted with an inter row distance of 5 0 m and an intra row distance of 4 0 m and the tree crown structure is very similar with that in our experiment the temporal dynamics of lai for those orchards were also described with logistic curves since the maximum values of lai were known and the initial values were supposed to be 0 15 and the growth stages were set to be the same as in our study in the scenario simulation input parameters related to canopy characteristics such as lai and plant height were calculated according to the data we derived above other parameters were set the same as in model development we should note that our validated model might not be suitable for orchards of different tree arrangement and canopy structure directly applying the uncalibrated parameters as in model development might results in system errors in the simulated results the scenario simulation here we mainly concern the inter comparison of different planting patterns so the simulated results are still indicative lai data of cocksfoot in 2016 the dry year and 2018 the normal year were used to evaluate the effects of tree canopy size on water use in agroforestry fig 11a and b we can see that with increasing of the age and coverage of apple tree the negative effect of cocksfoot on apple tree transpiration decreased in both of the dry and normal years reduction of tree transpiration was linearly related with the maximum lai of apple tree reduction magnitude in lc was accordingly lower than that in gc reduction magnitude and slope of the regression line in the normal season was much lower than that in the dry season lai data of apple tree in 2016 and 2018 were used to evaluate the effects of the width of cocksfoot strip on the transpiration of apple tree fig 11c and d lai of cocksfoot under gc and lc were also used by supposing that the lai of cocksfoot based on the area of cocksfoot strip remained stable so the coverage area and the lai based on the whole orchard increased with the increasing of strip width we can see that the reduction of apple tree transpiration increased with the strip width quickly when the width was less than 2 0 m and slowed down thereafter relationship between the reduction and the strip width of cocksfoot fitted well with exponential equations lc also showed weaker reduction effects than gc difference between lc and gc was more apparent in the normal season than that in the dry season canopy information of different aged apple tree table 1 and canopy information of cocksfoot in 2016 were used to simulating the long term effects 18 year simulation from 2001 to 2018 of agroforestry on et partitioning and soil water dynamics in apple orchard for the age with no tree canopy information the information of nearest greater aged tree was used for example 9 year aged tree used the canopy information of 10 year aged tree fig 12 shows the transpiration of apple tree and cocksfoot in the 18 years we can see that apple tree in ct showed larger amount of transpiration than those in gc and ct in the early ages during 2001 2008 however the maximum lai of apple tree was greater than 2 0 m2 m 2 thereafter transpiration of apple tree was not apparently restricted by the existing of cocksfoot the transpiration in lc was even greater than that in ct after 2008 except for the year 2009 and the transpiration in gc was lower than that in lc in all of the years in this period total transpiration of apple tree in the 18 years was 3709 7 mm in ct 3437 8 and 3630 7 mm in gc and lc respectively 7 3 and 2 1 lower than that in ct transpiration of cocksfoot decreased as apple tree growing up maintained a relatively stable value after 2007 and the total transpiration in the gc was 17 5 greater than that in the lc fig 13 shows the simulated dynamics of soil water content in 0 100 100 200 and 200 300 cm soil layer during 2001 2018 soil water content in the 0 100 cm layer fluctuated greatly only in the early several years could we find differences among the treatments in the below layers downward tendency in soil water content dynamics was found under all of the treatments soil water content under gc and lc was lower than that under ct in most years the differences were very large during the early ages of apple tree however we can see that soil water content at the end of 2018 was not greatly different among the treatments indicating that agroforestry did not accelerate soil water depletion in the apple orchard soil water drainage out of the 0 300 cm layer was 550 4 626 6 and 799 9 mm under gc lc and ct respectively 4 discussion an improvement of the multi source et model was provided in this study the original multi source model developed by wallace 1997 is robust for modeling et partitioning in intercropping systems especially those systems in which the component species have comparable height and the dominant crop has a greater coverage such as maize sorghum intercropping teh et al 2001 and maize soybean intercropping gao et al 2013 however when the dominant species is much higher and or has a lower coverage than the subdominant species as those cases in agroforestry the model would result in large error in simulation after considering the effects of canopy structure on understorey crop transpiration and soil evaporation resistances calculation in the multi source modeling was improved we illustrated the difference between transpiration partitioning simulated by the original and improved et models as influenced by canopy structure of agroforestry system in fig 14 in fig 14a it was assumed that the understorey crop had a stable lai of 3 0 m2 m 2 and lai of tree increased gradually plant height of tree and crop species were 4 0 and 0 2 m respectively we can see that the transpiration of the understorey crop was greatly reduced in the improved model especially when the lai of tree was relatively low while the transpiration of tree was increased in fig 14b lai of both tree and crop species were assumed to be 3 0 m2 m 2 plant height of the apple tree was set to be 4 0 m and that of the crop species increased gradually we can see that as plant height of the crop species increased difference between the crop transpiration simulated by the original and improved model reduced and difference between the tree transpiration simulated by the two model was also narrowed therefore the improved multi source model well depicted the canopy interaction of component species on transpiration partitioning in the multi species systems it could be applied in agroforestry systems as well as intercropping systems of heterogeneously structured canopy in addition the et model was combined with a mechanistic soil water transporting model the effects of root distribution and soil moisture on et partitioning in agroforestry was considered followed the study of celette et al 2010 a representation of the crop soil system in two dimensions with two separate soil compartments was presented roots of crop species in agroforestry distributed near the surface under the inter row soil water in this area was depleted by both tree and crop species while tree species has a deeper root system and the soil water in the deeper layers was used by tree species only soil water status and et partitioning were coupled together and affected each other every day this model can also present the widely concerned information about water status in deep soil layer validation showed that model well depicted the soil water dynamics and et in agroforestry systems in all the 3 years but the performance was better in 2018 when the rainfall distribution was more even throughout the season this might due to that several parameters such as soil resistance r s s and stomatal resistance of plants r s c were all related to soil water content by empirical equations these equations might fit better under moderate soil water conditions measurable model inputs are critical for the practical applicability of a model malezieux et al 2008 the model developed in this study could be applied based on measurements of parameters describing the canopy structure of agroforestry lai strip widths plant heights radiation extinction coefficient of component species commonly used soil hydraulic parameters and location and weather data the easily accessible parameters insured the practical applicability of the model but some parameters relating to the calculation of water transporting resistances such as the attenuation coefficient for eddy diffusivity n the mean boundary layer resistance r b and the mean stomatal resistance r st are difficult to be measured we used the default values suggested by shuttleworth and wallace 1985 choudhury and monteith 1988 shuttleworth and gurney 1990 teh 2006 and other multi source et model users in this study however the value for some parameters such as 2 5 for eddy diffusivity attenuation coefficient was suggested for agricultural crops direct applying it in apple tree canopy may lead to errors although we obtained satisfactory results in model validation and some other authors also applied the suggested parameters in modeling the et of fruit trees zhao et al 2015 a model parameterization would give more reliable value for uncertain parameters in a different environment with different canopy structure the model parameters should be reparametrized to closely represent the reality in scenario analysis in this study we used the same parameters as in model development which might also lead to system errors because tree species have distinct canopy structures which would contribute to different effects on water transportation processes so it was suggested to calibrate the key parameters relating to resistances calculation in using the model developed in this study in our field experiment total system et was not significantly different in the sole and agroforestry systems but transpiration of apple tree was severely restricted in the agroforestry systems especially in 2016 and 2017 when the rainfall was limited and unevenly distributed lai of apple tree was relatively low in this study the maximum values were less than 2 0 m2 m 2 in all of the three seasons low coverage of apple tree made more energy was available to cocksfoot which increased the water use of cocksfoot and reduced soil water content in the 0 100 cm soil layer approximately 65 of apple tree roots were distributed in this layer so the apple tree transpiration was largely affected another factor contributed to the reduction of apple tree transpiration was the decrease of vapor pressure deficit at mean canopy flow level as demonstrated by wallace 1997 effects of understorey species on vapor pressure deficit would be very significant when water was fully applied soil water was mostly deficit in this study so the contribution of vpd decrease to the reduction of apple tree transpiration was relatively low planting cocksfoot increased the overall coverage of apple orchard so soil evaporation was greatly cut down it can be concluded that the water transpired by cocksfoot was transferred from the reduction of water consumed through apple tree transpiration and soil evaporation in terms of water productivity more water was used to produce biomass in the agroforestry so water was more efficiently used this is in accordance with other studies about agroforestry bai et al 2016 we found that production of apple tree was not significantly influenced after planting cocksfoot in 2016 and 2017 wang et al 2019 although transpiration in apple tree was largely reduced in fact soil water content in ct was also very low in the dry periods although it was greater than that in the gc and lc which indicated that apple tree in all of the systems was restricted in water uptake the effects of weather condition on apple tree water uptake and production might be greater than the effects of intercropping cocksfoot so the three systems behaved similar in apple production in addition apple production is affected by other conditions such as spring freeze injury disease and fruit management so reduction in transpiration showed little adverse effect on fruit production long term simulation indicated that planting cocksfoot has adverse effects on the water uptake of apple tree in the first 8 years of agroforestry although apple tree is competed and its growth and production might be affected by understorey crops during this period the benefits of well managed intercropping would surely offset this loss coverage of apple tree in early growth is low and lots of energy is transmitted to the soil surface clean tillage would cause the waste of energy and water celette et al 2005 abbas et al 2017 applying intercropping could conserve soil water reduce soil erosion risk and increase carbon sequestration du et al 2015 ling et al 2017 also the production of intercrops could increase farmers income in the later period apple tree grows up and maintains a greater coverage agroforestry shows very little restriction effects on the transpiration of apple tree especially in the lc treatment trees in lc showed the greatest transpiration in most of the years indicating that low coverage intercrop is the best way of conserving soil water reducing the coverage of understorey crop is essential in water limited conditions increasing cutting frequency is an efficient way for cover crops management centinari et al 2013 while reducing strip width is more practical for grain crops zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2017 therefore we suggest to apply agroforestry in apple orchards in our study area but the coverage and strip width of intercrops should be controlled to make good use of its productive and ecological services and mostly reduce its adverse effects on apple tree in other kinds of fruit orchards agroforestry is also a sustainable way design and management should be optimized based on further experiment and modeling work 5 conclusions this study provided an et and soil water balance simulating model for agroforestry system daily et et partitioning and soil water content in different layers could be simulated with given information about soil weather canopy structure root distribution and initial soil water content the model was validated with experiment data measured in an apple tree and cocksfoot agroforestry system dynamics of soil water content and et in under different weather conditions were well simulated transpiration of apple tree was reduced by 21 3 32 5 in agroforestry system of greater cocksfoot coverage increasing cutting frequency of cocksfoot could effectively reduce the adverse effects of agroforestry on apple tree an 18 year scenario simulation showed that agroforestry with greater and low coverage of cocksfoot reduced the apple tree transpiration by 7 3 and 2 1 respectively and only accelerated soil water depletion in the early several years when coverage of apple tree was low the water transportation model provided in this study could be validated and applied to evaluate water use mechanisms and improve the design and management in other agroforestry systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare

herbst et al 1996 steduto and hsiao 1998 basso and ritchie 2012 here we have also demonstrated a relationship between seasonal t and maximum lai across densities n supply and seasons maize wue b t s ranged between 5 4 and 6 5 g m 2 mm 1 or g kg 1 across densities n levels and seasons table 2 and the range for wue b t s adj was from 5 9 to 8 0 g kg 1 kpa 1 these values fit within the range of maize wue b t s and wue b t s adj values reported by other authors connor et al 2011 and references cited therein maize wue b t s increased in response to n supply or plant density p 0 05 table 2 as a

in wue b t s when exploring a lower range of plant densities and during a shorter growing period than the one studied here to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that increases in wue b t s in response to higher plant densities were experimentally obtained and reported 3 3 wue b t s determinants rueb and gc maize rueb one of the components of wue b t s according to eq 1 was consistent with previous estimates for maize sinclair and muchow 1999 and references cited therein across n supply densities and seasons table 2 in previous work we have shown that n supply significantly increased rueb p 0 05 hernández et al 2015 in accordance with other works showing the close dependance of rueb on leaf nitrogen sinclair and horie 1989 muchow and sinclair 1994 direct effect of n supply on increasing photosynthetic capacity contribute to the consistent increases in rueb across environments e g wolfe et al 1988 echarte et al 2008 here we observed that rueb remained unchanged season 3 or did not show any consistent trend season 4 in response to increasing plant densities p 0 05 table 2 lower photosynthetic capacity at high densities due to both higher light attenuation within the canopy and an accelerated leaf senescence progress could be at the basis of rueb response to plant density borrás et al 2003 maddonni et al 2006 jia et al 2018 maize seasonal gc ranged between 0 37 and 0 51 mm mj 1 across treatments and seasons table 2 n supply did not affect seasonal gc in accordance with previous findings in maize teixeira et al 2014 and wheat caviglia and sadras 2001 on the contrary higher densities consistently reduced seasonal gc p 0 05 table 2 a negative linear relationship was fitted between gc and maximum lai across n levels densities and seasons r2 0 34 p 0 07 fig 2 where larger gc reductions were evident as maximum lai increased up to 3 9 but further maximum lai increments promoted lower i e when increasing plant density from 8 to 12 plants m 2 or non for n supply gc reductions inset to fig 2 at the leaf level stomatal conductance gsl increased in response to n supply season 1 p 0 05 table 3 other reports also showed larger gsl at higher n supply in maize lamptey et al 2017 mccullough et al 1994 wong et al 1985 higher densities reduced gsl p 0 05 table 3 in agreement with ren et al 2017 while gsl was modified with both n supply and density managements only density affected gc table 2 the leaf and canopy conductance reductions with increasing plant population might be explained by decreases of the canopy coupling with atmosphere with increasing lai steduto and hsiao 1998 since leaf n determines c assimilation n deficiency is expected to have a large effect on leaf conductance farquhar et al 1980 but not on canopy conductance caviglia and sadras 2001 except under severe n deficiency where canopy architecture and canopy atmosphere coupling can be affected jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 in environments where terminal droughts are frequent lowering plant populations or matching n supply to attainable yields have been recommended in order to reduce t and thus to maximize the availability of water during critical periods and promote larger growth of plants dabaeke and aboudrare 2004 rotili et al 2019 hernández et al 2020 however lowering plant density may result in smaller t reductions than expected since gc i e transpired water per unit of ipar increased in this condition table 2 considering that wue b t s increase with increasing density table 2 and that there exist drought tolerant maize hybrids with higher tolerance to water stress gaffney et al 2015 cooper et al 2014 nagore et al 2017 lowering plant density seems an inefficient practice to maximize the growth of maize crops in drought prone environments 4 conclusions results of this work highlight the relevant contribution of wue b t s to wue b et s response to n supply or plant densities for the first time we have shown that transpiration efficiency can be increased with higher densities we have also demonstrated that the increase in transpiration efficiency produced by n supply was better associated with increases in radiation use efficiency while higher transpiration efficiency in response to increased plant density was better related to reductions in crop conductance a relationship between crop conductance and maximum lai was established across n supply plant densities and seasons highlighting that increments in maximum lai above 3 9 may result in little or non reductions in crop conductance and in turn will not contribute to transpiration efficiency improvements our findings warn about the importance of considering crop conductance changes especially in drought prone environments where lowering plant density increases the crop conductance i e higher transpired water per unit of intercepted par declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

maize wue b t s and wue b t s adj values reported by other authors connor et al 2011 and references cited therein maize wue b t s increased in response to n supply or plant density p 0 05 table 2 as a result of much larger increases in biomass than in t mean increases in wue b t s across seasons were 19 for n supply 8 for plant density increments from 4 to 8 plants m 2 and 12 for plant density increments from 4 to 12 plants m 2 table 2 our findings on wue b t s response to n supply agree with those from teixeira et al 2014 for maize based on estimates of t and with those from zhang et al 1998 and caviglia and sadras 2001 for wheat based on estimates of e and estimated et from water balances moreover experimental data here presented agree with responses of transpiration efficiency for grain yield wue g t s to plant density increments from 4 to 10 plants m 2 predicted by simulation models ritchie and basso 2008 in contrast to our results walker 1986 was not able to identify changes in wue b t s when exploring a lower range of plant densities and during a shorter growing period than the one studied here to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that increases in wue b t s in response to higher plant densities were experimentally obtained and reported 3 3 wue b t s determinants rueb and gc maize rueb one of the components of wue b t s according to eq 1 was consistent with previous estimates for maize sinclair and muchow 1999 and references cited therein across n supply densities and seasons table 2 in previous work we have shown that n supply significantly increased rueb p 0 05 hernández et al 2015 in accordance with other works showing the close dependance of rueb on leaf nitrogen sinclair and horie 1989 muchow and sinclair 1994 direct effect of n supply on increasing photosynthetic capacity contribute to the consistent increases in rueb across environments e g wolfe et al 1988 echarte et al 2008 here we observed that rueb remained unchanged season 3 or did not show any consistent trend season 4 in response to increasing plant densities p 0 05 table 2 lower photosynthetic capacity at high densities due to both higher light attenuation within the canopy and an accelerated leaf senescence progress could be at the basis of rueb response to plant density borrás et al 2003 maddonni et al 2006 jia et al 2018 maize seasonal gc ranged between 0 37 and 0 51 mm mj 1 across treatments and seasons table 2 n supply did not affect seasonal gc in accordance with previous findings in maize teixeira et al 2014 and wheat caviglia and sadras 2001 on the contrary higher densities consistently reduced seasonal gc p 0 05 table 2 a negative linear relationship was fitted between gc and maximum lai across n levels densities and seasons r2 0 34

non for n supply gc reductions inset to fig 2 at the leaf level stomatal conductance gsl increased in response to n supply season 1 p 0 05 table 3 other reports also showed larger gsl at higher n supply in maize lamptey et al 2017 mccullough et al 1994 wong et al 1985 higher densities reduced gsl p 0 05 table 3 in agreement with ren et al 2017 while gsl was modified with both n supply and density managements only density affected gc table 2 the leaf and canopy conductance reductions with increasing plant population might be explained by decreases of the canopy coupling with atmosphere with increasing lai steduto and hsiao 1998 since leaf n determines c assimilation n deficiency is expected to have a large effect on leaf conductance farquhar et al 1980 but not on canopy conductance caviglia and sadras 2001 except under severe n deficiency where canopy architecture and canopy atmosphere coupling can be affected jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 in environments where terminal droughts are frequent lowering plant populations or matching n supply to attainable yields have been recommended in order to reduce t and thus to maximize the availability of water during critical periods and promote larger growth of plants dabaeke and aboudrare 2004 rotili et al 2019 hernández et al 2020 however lowering plant density may result in smaller t reductions than expected since gc i e transpired water per unit of ipar increased in this condition table 2 considering that wue b t s increase with increasing density table 2 and that there exist drought tolerant maize hybrids with higher tolerance to water stress gaffney et al 2015 cooper et al 2014 nagore et al 2017 lowering plant density seems an inefficient practice to maximize the growth of maize crops in drought prone environments 4 conclusions results of this work highlight the relevant contribution of wue b t s to wue b et s response to n supply or plant densities for the first time we have shown that transpiration efficiency can be increased with higher densities we have also demonstrated that the increase in transpiration efficiency produced by n supply was better associated with increases in radiation use efficiency while higher transpiration efficiency in response to increased plant density was better related to reductions in crop conductance a relationship between crop conductance and maximum lai was established across n supply plant densities and seasons highlighting that increments in maximum lai above 3 9 may result in little or non reductions in crop conductance and in turn will not contribute to transpiration efficiency improvements our findings warn about the importance of considering crop conductance changes especially in drought prone environments where lowering plant density increases the crop conductance i e higher transpired water per unit of intercepted par declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10118,emitter clogging negatively affects the performance of subsurface drip irrigation systems the porous ceramic emitters of a subsurface irrigation system were investigated to identify the reasons for emitters clogging using 2 year operational data in an apple orchard the soil water content and the emitters discharge were measured the position and composition of the clogging substance were investigated and the thickness of the adhesion layer in the channel of the emitter was calculated further a flushing experiment using acid water with a ph of 6 was carried out to assess emitter clogging the primary reason for the emitter clogging was substances precipitated at the inlet of the emitter resulting in reducing the discharge of the emitter at the same time the water flow was affected by the clogging substance inside the micropore close to the channels the main compounds of the clogging substances were sio2 caco3 and mgal2o4 fe cl and k were also observed bacteria fungus and microalgae secreted plfas to form biofilm we have tested 4 flushing times 3 min 10 min 15 min 20 min and found that when the flushing time lasted 15 min the corresponding emitter discharge were 0 046 l h 1 and 0 136 l h 1 under the working pressure of 2 kpa and 5 kpa and discharge recovery rate were 51 11 and 75 56 respectively however when the flushing time increased to 20 min the discharge recovery was similar to that of 15 min therefore it is recommended to flush with an acid solution for 15 min at flushing pressure of 100 kpa pressure to minimize the emitter clogging keywords porous ceramic emitter emitter discharge clogging composition clogging position flushing time 1 introduction clogging of emitters a common problem in any drip irrigation system has become a major challenge to the application and improvement of irrigation technology niu et al 2013 emitter clogging changes the original hydraulic performance of the emitter which reduces the discharge thereby seriously affecting the operation effect and safety of the subsurface irrigation system at the same time emitter clogging reduces the service life of the irrigation system and increases the use cost of irrigation becoming a widespread and difficult factor that restricts the promotion of subsurface irrigation technology gilbert et al 1981 nakayama and bucks 1981 a number of researches have been carried out on the emitter clogging mainly paying attention to clogging at labyrinth and orifice sections of emitters zhangzhong et al 2019 li et al 2012 the emitter clogging may be caused by bacterial growth and particle deposition that inevitably occur after a long time running due to the complex environment in the water given that water quality is complex especially water physical chemical and biological factors often exacerbate the emitter clogging literature suggested that suspended particles are not a trigger of the clogging processes but the accumulation of particles may initiate the formation of biofilm on the surface of the flow channel which aggravates the blockage adin and sacks 1991 zhou et al 2013 concluded that when using reclaimed water an extracellular polymer secreted from the biological growth may cause clogging by continuous adsorbing microorganisms and solid particles wu et al 2004a 2004b also found that the main causes of the above clogging were the adsorption deposition and development of particles or fine hairs in the flow path of the emitters operated for eight years in addition particle deposition and biofilm growth in the inlet channel and initial vortex zones were found in most of these emitters that have only one flow channel which causes the decreased discharge of the emitters ait mouheb et al 2019 at the same time some researchers proposed designs with a flushing system for the clogged emitters in the flushing system securing an appropriate pressure is very important to effectively dislodge and transport accumulated sediments at appropriate shear stress yu et al 2018 suggested that the lifespan of drippers increased by 50 compared to those of the no flushing system green et al 2018 suggested that oxidation treatments using hydrogen peroxide or hypochlorite acid eliminate biofouling and prevented clogging chlorination treatment also has been proposed to enhance the treatment of clogging in drip irrigation systems and inhibiting the growth of bacteria in the water hao et al 2018 song et al 2017 however it was worth noting that a low concentration chlorination mode for a long duration has been recommended as a high concentration chlorination mode for a short duration song et al 2019 found that the chlorination concentration of 5 mg l 1 for 0 5 h was more likely to induce adverse effects on soil than the chlorination concentration of 1 25 mg l 1 for 2 h in recent years porous ceramic emitter which is based in the theory of pot irrigation has been developed for subsurface irrigation systems cai et al 2017b 2015 because the emitter is applied underground it reduces surface evaporation caused by atmospheric temperature wind speed humidity and so on the emitter pore size is micron level similar to a capillary channel that is capable of actively absorbing water since the working pressure of the porous ceramic emitter 2 5 kpa is relatively low to save energy cai et al 2018 it prevents the harm of suction mud from the negative pressure and the root intrusion cai et al 2014 2017a moreover an 2017 found that yields and the irrigation water use efficiency in lettuce could be improved by the porous ceramic emitter cai 2019 also found the yield of apple tree improved 7 6 and irrigation water use efficiency improved 10 1 compared to conventional subsurface drip irrigation tape using porous ceramic emitter is a better way of irrigation however the porous ceramic emitter clogging may be different from conventional emitters as the porous ceramic emitter has a larger area of passage and multiple channels to explore the cause of the porous ceramic emitter clogging dong et al 2019 found that the particles carried by irrigation water gradually form a sediment layer on the inner wall of the porous ceramic emitter as the particles are not sucked into the micropores chen et al 2019 added nahco3 na2so4 nacl and cacl2 to form different kinds of saline water sources with different electrical conductivity and found that the flocculation of the caco3 in the water was progressive to form stable and compacted aggregates with an increase of salt content while these experiments were carried out in the air the porous ceramic emitters are usually buried in the soil and the reason of the emitter clogging is not clear and the degree of discharge recovery after flushing is questionable since fine substances such as silt algae and bacteria are easy to be flocculated previous studies indicated that eliminating the fine substances is closely related to a flushing time rather than flushing pressure yu et al 2018 however it is questionable how long the flushing needs to be conducted when the porous ceramic emitter is clogged in this study the emitters that had been working with surface irrigation water in the field for 2 years were selected not only to better understand the clogging of the porous ceramic emitters used in irrigation with the degree of emitter clogging but also to propose an efficient flushing time to restore emitter discharge optical microscope electron microscope and x ray diffractometer were used for determining the thickness position and composition of clogging substances inside the emitter respectively we also analyzed the types of organism besides a suitable anti clogging method was proposed to effectively restore the discharge of the emitter corresponding to different flushing effects 2 material and methods 2 1 layout of the subsurface irrigation system with porous ceramic emitter this study selected an apple orchard in zizhou county yulin city shaanxi province of china as an experimental site on the loess plateau the local temperature during the irrigation season was 11 25 c combining the patent of a subsurface irrigation system with porous ceramic emitters that utilizes mountain rainwater harvesting wu 2018 a rainwater harvesting facility had been built for irrigation as shown in fig 1 the water was precipitated in rainwater harvesting facility and had a filter at the outlet the system was composed of five laterals each lateral length was 50 m and a water tank 1 5 m3 placed in front of each lateral to provide a water source the porous ceramic emitter was mainly made of quartz sand that the porous parameter of 10 100 μm and the average discharge of non used emitters was 0 09 l h 1 under 2 kpa according to cai et al 2018 the working pressure of ceramic emitter would be 2 5 kpa controlled by the water tank the water cellar supplied water to the water tank through a lateral and added water every 10 days 20 samples were taken for analyzing water quality characteristics chemical oxygen demand cod dry matter content ph nh4 n ca fe and particle size distribution as shown in table 1 since the pore size of the porous ceramic emitter was 10 100 μm some particles could flow out of the emitter with the water flow valves were also installed at the front and the rear of each tank connection to control influent and effluent flows the flushing valve was arranged at the end of the lateral since the growth of apple trees requires nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizers n 23 kg km2 p2o5 14 3 kg km2 and k2so4 24 kg km2 were used to meet the requirements of apple trees growth the subsurface irrigation system with the porous ceramic emitter was arranged according to the arrangement of one tube and one row 25 emitters were placed at each lateral every 2 m in particular a ceramic emitter was placed under each apple tree as the work of chen et al 2018 the emitters were buried at a depth of 20 cm to reduce evaporation of soil water effectively based on the growing range of apple tree roots the distance from the trunk was 90 cm since it is difficult to detect the discharge of the emitter in the soil the irrigation effect of the emitter can be judged by measuring the soil water content for measuring the soil water content 3 locations were selected for each lateral by tdr time domain reflectometry every 10 days except for rainy days tdr tubes were installed at 10 20 and 70 cm away from the plant the soil water content was measured at 10 20 40 60 80 and 100 cm with 3 sampling locations for each tube at the same time the soil water content under the apple trees that were not irrigated was also measured as a control group the average soil water content θ is as follows 1 θ v w c i s d i s d i where vwc i and sd i are the soil water content and soil layer thickness mm of each layer respectively during the experiment the end valve kept open to drain the water from the tank and lateral at the end of the growth period from may to october after the end of the 2 year trial 50 emitters from only 2 laterals fig 1 b were randomly selected the place 1 m away from the side of the tree was excavated to determine the position of the emitter for reducing the damage to the root system when the excavation was finished the soil was backfilled and each emitter was sealed in a bag for the next test 2 2 the discharge of emitter discharge is an important indicator to evaluate the degree of clogging of the emitter once emitters were dug out 10 emitters were placed on a platform of the hydraulic performance test to measure the discharge fig 2 the end valve in the test of the hydraulic platform in fig 2 was closed and the water only flowed from the emitter the working pressure of 2 kpa was controlled by the height difference between the piezometric tube in the mariotte bottle and the emitter in order to better judge the blockage the discharge of each emitter was measured 3 times for half an hour per each test and a value averaged over 3 measurements was obtained as the final discharge for each emitter the discharged water was collected in a cup that is weighed at 0 01 g accuracy using an electronic balance and unified treatment of water the emitter performance is evaluated by the relative discharge q po that is calculated by eq 2 2 q p o q i q 0 100 where i is the serial number of the emitters q i is the discharge of the i th emitter l h 1 and q 0 is the average discharge of non used emitters 0 09 l h 1 in this study the mean discharge of 25 emitters under 2 kpa the standard deviation is 0 04 2 3 analysis of emitter clogging since the working pressure of the emitter in the yield and discharge test were 2 kpa the discharge test didn t induce clogging after the discharge test the 10 emitters also were used to analyze emitter clogging to verify the emitter clogging the deposition thickness clogging position the types of organism and clogging composition were measured in order to prevent the sample from polluting the clogging composition during the experiment the part of the emitter was reserved when measuring the thickness as shown in the fig 3 from the surface boundary of the clogging substance to the inner wall of the emitter zeiss axio scope a1 mat material metallographic microscope in this study the thickness of the adhesion layer for 10 emitters was measured by the image processing software digitizer at 3 positions within each emitter and measured 5 times per position to ensure the thickness less affected by sampling the averaged thickness of 5 measurements was taken as the thickness of the position and the averaged thickness of the 3 positions was taken as the thickness of the adhesion layer of the emitter to reduce the accidental error a small cutting machine was used to dissect the emitter during the experiment some powders adhered to the edge of the emitter during the dissection were excluded to avoid interfering with the experimental results in addition this study used a random sampling method to detect the position of micro pore clogging there were two parts to collect the information 1 the inlet of the emitter fig 4 1 and 2 the outlet of the emitter fig 4 2 they were used to make a sem scanning electron microscope nano sem 450 observation sample to obtain a digital image acquisition composition analysis was also conducted for the clogging substances attached to the inner wall of the ceramic emitter and the composition in a dried condition was scanned by the x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 advance a25 angle multiple linear 0 0001 goniometer radius 200 mm angle range 10 80 the internal clogging substances of 3 emitters were taken and grinded them into powder for composition analysis the obtained polycrystalline diffraction image was qualitatively analyzed using an analysis software mdi jade 6 for xrd software application to determine the composition of the clogging substances at the same time the clogging substances shown in the image were subjected to an energy spectrum analysis to determine its constituents moreover the clogging substance of emitters were mixed together for the types of microorganisms testing we divided the collected biofilms into 3 samples randomly and equally they were tested for the phospholipid fatty acids plfas to get the types of microorganisms testing methods were based on details described by zhou et al 2013 plfas biomarkers of indicated microorganisms also referred to zhou et al 2013 2 4 anti clogging experiment in the field test since no suitable flushing method has been studied the lateral was not flushed and only the end valve was opened after the end of the fertility period to drain the water in the lateral therefore an efficient flushing mode is needed to solve the emitter clogging in the field experiment the test platform for flushing was that replaces the markov bottle with a pump and loads a pressure gauge to control head pressure fig 2 at present the traditional flushing pressure is 300 500 kpa yu et al 2018 puig bargues et al 2010 however the ceramic emitter and the lateral were connected by viscous glue and the maximum pressure at the connection cannot exceed 100 kpa in order to reduce the emitter clogging to the greatest extent the flushing test was implemented with a pressure of 100 kpa with 10 emitters per group for testing and 4 groups at the same time the flushing water used in this study was acid added water ph 6 it is not harmful to the field environment to improve the flushing efficiency as the flow passage area of the ceramic emitter is large this study tested various flush times to select the appropriate flushing time by gradually increasing the flushing time i e 3 min 10 min 15 min and 20 min in irrigation depending on the ph value measured before the experiment hcl 0 1 mol l 1 was added to the water to obtain the designed ph value during the acidification process repeated water cycles increased the possibility of acid consumption whenever the acid was injected a ph meter was used to measure the ph value in water every 3 min the designed ph value was maintained by injecting the amount of acid during the acidification process based on ph monitoring by the acidity meter the efficiency of flushing time on the emitters was evaluated corresponding to the recovery rate of the discharge once the flushing was completed the discharge after the emitter flushing was still measured by a device refer to 2 2 with some adjustments when the discharge of each emitter was measured the average discharge of the emitters was employed as a flow indicator of each emitter type to fairly compare the changes of the discharge the discharge available for the flushed emitter was obtained from the 2 pressures of 2 kpa and 5 kpa at the same time the selected emitter sample was scrutinized with an electron microscope after the lateral was flushed this test may provide a certain reference as to how much the clogged emitter discharge can increase for subsequent field tests 3 results 3 1 emitter performance fig 5 shows that the relative discharge q po of the porous ceramic emitters that were operated for a period of time it is found that the relative value is below 20 for the emitters iso 2003 specifies that the emitter relative discharge below 25 30 may cause serious clogging indicating that the emitters used in this study are severely clogged the reason for the discharge decreased is that there is a blockage in the emitter eq 3 shows the linear relationship between emitter discharge and the thickness of the adhesion layer even though the porous ceramic emitter is composed of a porous structure that provides many flow channels and many possibilities of outflow the discharge of the emitter decreases gradually with an increase in thickness generally speaking an irrigation system operated for a while usually may cause the thicker layer deposition of clogging substances researches showed that the low flow velocity caused more deposits in the pipeline due to a reduced shear stress of water mietta et al 2009 douterelo et al 2012 under the working pressure 2 5 kpa 0 09 l h 1 and 0 18 l h 1 respectively used in this study the velocity was very low 7 9 10 5 m s 1 and 15 8 10 5 m s 1 respectively resulting in more substance deposit in the emitter because the emitter is equivalent to a filter which causes different clogging degrees of the emitters moreover the clogging substances are difficult to remove due to low discharge rate park et al 2011 paul et al 2012 consequently there is a thick adhesive layer in the inside of the porous ceramic emitter 3 q 0 0234 t 0 0197 r 2 0 9297 p 0 004 where q is the discharge of emitter l h 1 t is the thickness of the adhesion layer mm r 2 is the goodness of fit p 0 05 means significant 3 2 clogging position during the experiment clogging occurred in the emitter fig 6 shows microscopic photo of the sampling of emitters at different positions the brand new emitter s pores are clearly shown in fig 6 a at the inlet of the clogged emitter fig 6 b the clogging substances clogged the pores and there were some filamentous fibers in contrast at emitter outlet more fine particles were found on the pores as shown in fig 6 c because the soil s particles attached to the emitter surface the micro pores were clearly visible without substances clogged when away from the boundary as the same with the inlet of the clogged emitter the clogging of porous media is more complicated than a labyrinth path because of the deepening of flow channels the low discharge rate causes a slower transfer rate of nutrients and subsequently solid particulate matters at the inlet are more abundant than the outlet of the emitter the micropores are not capable of providing suitable growth space and nutrients zhou et al 2014 the pores inside the emitter were clearly visible such results indicate that the main trigger of the emitter clogging is the adhesion layer and clogging substance in the pores the reason why there are so many clogging substances inside the emitter is the presence of nutrients and microorganisms in the water the rise in temperature affects the quality of the water under the local temperature of 11 25 c during the irrigation season the biological activity in the water is stronger causing more serious blockages tong et al 2019 sanz lázaro et al 2015 3 3 clogging composition fig 7 demonstrates the composition of clogging substance it is found that sio2 accounted for the highest portion in the inorganic crystal among the crystal components mainly due to the presence of particles in the water the clogging substances were also composed of caco3 mgal2o4 an analysis of elemental composition also shows that c o and si are relatively high while the clogging substances contained little fe cl and k table 2 besides the clogging substance mainly contained bacteria 14 0 i15 0 i16 0 16 1 7t 16 1 9t 17 0 i17 0 a17 0 18 0 18 1 7c and 20 0 fungus 18 2w6 9c microalgae 16 3w3 they grow and secrete plfas which constituted biological clogging zhou et al 2013 it is worth noting that the clogging substances contain both fe2 and ca2 that promote the production of microorganisms and precipitation of solid particles resulting in increasing the risk of clogging hao et al 2017 3 4 anti clogging method the capacity of discharge recovery is closely dependent on flush times as shown in fig 8 for a short flushing time i e 3 min 10 min the adhesion layer was not removed effectively and resulted less discharge of the emitter given a longer 15 min flushing time for example the discharge was 0 046 l h 1 at 2 kpa and the corresponding discharge recovery rate was only 51 11 compared to the non used emitter discharge moreover the discharge recovery rate was 75 56 under 5 kpa emitter discharge after flushed has been improved and this result indicates that the discharge recovery rate of the emitter can be improved as the working pressure increases unfortunately a longer flushing time is not always effective to solve the clogging of the emitter the discharge recovery rate not improved significantly although the flushing time increased by 20 min it was recommended to apply 15 min flushing time at 100 kpa to effectively improve the emitter discharge 4 discussion as the increase of time the emitter gradually became clogged the soil water content after irrigation was close to that in the non irrigated soil in the second year as shown in fig 9 research shows that the maximum water requirement for the apple trees should be 80 of the field capacity 0 25 cm3 cm 3 xu et al 2016 in the fig 9 the soil water content is greater than 20 even when the emitter was clogged which is still above the maximum requirement of the soil water content for the apple trees this indicates that porous ceramic emitter can still provide some water needed for apple trees after 2 years of operation it seems to indicate that the relative discharge to evaluate the emitter clogging may be not suitable for the porous ceramic emitters at the same time we sampled the soil water content on different weather conditions sunny day cloud cover less than 10 and rainfall in second year fig 10 even in sunny day the soil water content can meet the apple tree s growth conditions within the range of soil depth of 0 60 cm since the emitter discharge is considerably sensitive to the change of pressure cai et al 2018 when the emitter discharge is greater than the infiltration rate of the soil the soil produces a positive pressure that further suppresses the outflow of the emitter wu et al 2004a 2004b also pointed out that the positive pressure of the soil could reach 0 15 mpa which was greater than the working pressure of the emitter given that a stable level of the soil water content causes a small discharge of the emitter the emitter discharge in the soil can be less than a designed discharge in a long term stable environment however ceramic irrigation systems always continuously provide part of the irrigation water to the soil over time even the emitter discharge is small such result indicates that continuous irrigation from the porous ceramic emitters may reduce the deviation of soil water content caused by emitter clogging instead the uniformity of the soil water content in a certain period of time might be a better index to evaluate the irrigation quality to reduce the requirement for the deviation of discharge even if the porous ceramic emitter can provide enough irrigation water for crops when it is clogged it is still necessary to solve the blockage for the good operation of the system lateral flushing removes sediments accumulated within lateral these sediments will not clog emitters however the pore clogging substances still remain in the micropore even after the flushing we have tested 10 samples of flushed emitters and found that there were some clogging substances in the pores of the emitter fig 11 compared to a clean emitter fig 6 a which explains the reason that the discharge improved less than expected the flushing time effectively reduces the substance deposited on the inner wall of the emitter but it was difficult to achieve effective removal of the substance in the micropores the clogging substance continues to prevent the flow of water from the inlet to the outlet it is difficult to restore the emitter discharge as much as a non used emitter discharge besides the inside of the porous ceramic emitter consists of a number of capillary channels that have a strong adsorption effect tang et al 2018 the air in the water is absorbed into the inner wall which deteriorates the discharge rate by reducing the capacity of the flow channel lazouskaya and jin 2008 at the same time gas accumulation occurs on the surface of the channel from co2 produced by the respiration of the organism e g aeruginosa fungus when biological respiration produces co2 it dissolves in water to form hco3 and the ph of the water is slightly alkaline forming co32 and ca2 in the water reacted with it to form caco3 which exacerbated the blockage meanwhile han et al 2019 found that the presence of gas water interfaces mixed gas water fluids clearly promoted pore clogging because finer particles are readily collected at the gas water interfaces resulting in high particle concentration at the same time the substances accumulated in deep inside of the micropores are not removed efficiently the emitter used in this study had a wall thickness of 2 cm the internal structure is intricate and not uniform zhou et al 2020 given that the pressure presses clogging substances accumulated in the inside of the emitter the more clogging is likely to occur due to the change in the pore size salvatore citoa 2012 therefore it s necessary to explore the frequency of flushing laterals during irrigation in addition antagonistic microorganisms have an influence on reducing emitter clogging and it provides a better way to suppress the clogging of the porous ceramic emitters sahin et al 2005 5 conclusions this paper mainly analyzed the causes of the clogging for the porous ceramic emitters and suggested suitable solutions the results of this study were about 75 clogging occurred inside the emitter continuously operated for two years in the field test subsequently causing less discharge for the apple trees the relationship between the thickness of the adhesion layer and the of emitter discharge was congruous with a linear relationship which is one of the reasons that the emitter discharge decreased however the continuous irrigation with the ceramic emitters enhanced the capacity to keep a certain level of soil moisture when the emitter flowed out the substances in the water were precipitated at the inlet of the emitter in contrast to the micropores of the outlet of emitter clogging substances were only found at the inlet pores of the emitter the clogging substances were mainly contained sio2 caco3 and mgal2o4 and the element fe cl and k further the clogging substances contained bacteria fungus and microalgae which secrete plfas to form biofilm it was recommended to apply an acid solution with a ph of 6 for the flushing time of 15 min at 100 kpa pressure for the clogged emitter and the discharge could be restored up to 75 56 of the designed discharge under the 5 kpa this method is to reduce blockages for already clogged emitter and future studies need to focus on the frequency of flushing laterals during irrigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

clogging the primary reason for the emitter clogging was substances precipitated at the inlet of the emitter resulting in reducing the discharge of the emitter at the same time the water flow was affected by the clogging substance inside the micropore close to the channels the main compounds of the clogging substances were sio2 caco3 and mgal2o4 fe cl and k were also observed bacteria fungus and microalgae secreted plfas to form biofilm we have tested 4 flushing times 3 min 10 min 15 min 20 min and found that when the flushing time lasted 15 min the corresponding emitter discharge were 0 046 l h 1 and 0 136 l h 1 under the working pressure of 2 kpa and 5 kpa and discharge recovery rate were 51 11 and 75 56 respectively however when the flushing time increased to 20 min the discharge recovery was similar to that of 15 min therefore it is recommended to flush with an acid solution for 15 min at flushing pressure of 100 kpa pressure to minimize the emitter clogging keywords porous ceramic emitter emitter discharge clogging composition clogging position flushing time 1 introduction clogging of emitters a common problem in any drip irrigation system has become a major challenge to the application and improvement of irrigation technology niu et al 2013 emitter clogging changes the original hydraulic performance of the emitter which reduces the discharge thereby seriously affecting the operation effect and safety of the subsurface irrigation system at the same time emitter clogging reduces the service life of the irrigation system and increases the use cost of irrigation becoming a widespread and difficult factor that restricts the promotion of subsurface irrigation technology gilbert et al 1981 nakayama and bucks 1981 a number of researches have been carried out on the emitter clogging mainly paying attention to clogging at labyrinth and orifice sections of emitters zhangzhong et al 2019 li et al 2012 the emitter clogging may be caused by bacterial growth and particle deposition that inevitably occur after a long time running due to the complex environment in the water given that water quality is complex especially water physical chemical and biological factors often exacerbate the emitter clogging literature suggested that suspended particles are not a trigger of the clogging processes but the accumulation of particles may initiate the formation of biofilm on the surface of the flow channel which aggravates the blockage adin and sacks 1991 zhou et al 2013 concluded that when using reclaimed water an extracellular polymer secreted from the biological growth may cause clogging by continuous adsorbing microorganisms and solid particles wu et al 2004a 2004b also found that the main causes of the above clogging were the adsorption deposition and development of particles or fine hairs in the flow path of the emitters operated for eight years in addition particle deposition and biofilm growth in the inlet channel and initial vortex zones were found in most of these emitters that have only one flow channel which causes the decreased discharge of the emitters ait mouheb et al 2019 at the same time some researchers proposed designs with a flushing system for the clogged emitters in the flushing system securing an appropriate pressure is very important to effectively dislodge and transport accumulated sediments at appropriate shear stress yu et al 2018 suggested that the lifespan of drippers increased by 50 compared to those of the no flushing system green et al 2018 suggested that oxidation treatments using hydrogen peroxide or hypochlorite acid eliminate biofouling and prevented clogging chlorination treatment also has been proposed to enhance the treatment of clogging in drip irrigation systems and inhibiting the growth of bacteria in the water hao et al 2018 song et al 2017 however it was worth noting that a low concentration chlorination mode for a long duration has been recommended as a high concentration chlorination mode for a short duration song et al 2019 found that the chlorination concentration of 5 mg l 1 for 0 5 h was more likely to induce adverse effects on soil than the chlorination concentration of 1 25 mg l 1 for 2 h in recent years porous ceramic emitter which is based in the theory of pot irrigation has been developed for subsurface irrigation systems cai et al 2017b 2015 because the emitter is applied underground it reduces surface evaporation caused by atmospheric temperature wind speed humidity and so on the emitter pore size is micron level similar to a capillary channel that is capable of actively absorbing water since the working pressure of the porous ceramic emitter 2 5 kpa is relatively low to save energy cai et al 2018 it prevents the harm of suction mud from the negative pressure and the root intrusion cai et al 2014 2017a moreover an 2017 found that yields and the irrigation water use efficiency in lettuce could be improved by the porous ceramic emitter cai 2019 also found the yield of apple tree improved 7 6 and irrigation water use efficiency improved 10 1 compared to conventional subsurface drip irrigation tape using porous ceramic emitter is a better way of irrigation however the porous ceramic emitter clogging may be different from conventional emitters as the porous ceramic emitter has a larger area of passage and multiple channels to explore the cause of the porous ceramic emitter clogging dong et al 2019 found that the particles carried by irrigation water gradually form a sediment layer on the inner wall of the porous ceramic emitter as the particles are not sucked into the micropores chen et al 2019 added nahco3 na2so4 nacl and cacl2 to form different kinds of saline water sources with different electrical conductivity and found that the flocculation of the caco3 in the water was progressive to form stable and compacted aggregates with an increase of salt content while these experiments were carried out in the air the porous ceramic emitters are usually buried in the soil and the reason of the emitter clogging is not clear and the degree of discharge recovery after flushing is questionable since fine substances such as silt algae and bacteria are easy to be flocculated previous studies indicated that eliminating the fine substances is closely related to a flushing time rather than flushing pressure yu et al 2018 however it is questionable how long the flushing needs to be conducted when the porous ceramic emitter is clogged in this study the emitters that had been working with surface irrigation water in the field for 2 years were selected not only to better understand the clogging of the porous ceramic emitters used in irrigation with the degree of emitter clogging but also to propose an efficient flushing time to restore emitter discharge optical microscope electron microscope and x ray diffractometer were used for determining the thickness position and composition of clogging substances inside the emitter respectively we also analyzed the types of organism besides a suitable anti clogging method was proposed to effectively restore the discharge of the emitter corresponding to different flushing effects 2 material and methods 2 1 layout of the subsurface irrigation system with porous ceramic emitter this study selected an apple orchard in zizhou county yulin city shaanxi province of china as an experimental site on the loess plateau the local temperature during the irrigation season was 11 25 c combining the patent of a subsurface irrigation system with porous ceramic emitters that utilizes mountain rainwater harvesting wu 2018 a rainwater harvesting facility had been built for irrigation as shown in fig 1 the water was precipitated in rainwater harvesting facility and had a filter at the outlet the system was composed of five laterals each lateral length was 50 m and a water tank 1 5 m3 placed in front of each lateral to provide a water source the porous ceramic emitter was mainly made of quartz sand that the porous parameter of 10 100 μm and the average discharge of non used emitters was 0 09 l h 1 under 2 kpa according to cai et al 2018 the working pressure of ceramic emitter would be 2 5 kpa controlled by the water tank the water cellar supplied water to the water tank through a lateral and added water every 10 days 20 samples were taken for analyzing water quality characteristics chemical oxygen demand cod dry matter content ph nh4 n ca fe and particle size distribution as shown in table 1 since the pore size of the porous ceramic emitter was 10 100 μm some particles could flow out of the emitter with the water flow valves were also installed at the front and the rear of each tank connection to control influent and effluent flows the flushing valve was arranged at the end of the lateral since the growth of apple trees requires nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizers n 23 kg km2 p2o5 14 3 kg km2 and k2so4 24 kg km2 were used to meet the requirements of apple trees growth the subsurface irrigation system with the porous ceramic emitter was arranged according to the arrangement of one tube and one row 25 emitters were placed at each lateral every 2 m in particular a ceramic emitter was placed under each apple tree as the work of chen et al 2018 the emitters were buried at a depth of 20 cm to reduce evaporation of soil water effectively based on the growing range of apple tree roots the distance from the trunk was 90 cm since it is difficult to detect the discharge of the emitter in the soil the irrigation effect of the emitter can be judged by measuring the soil water content for measuring the soil water content 3 locations were selected for each lateral by tdr time domain reflectometry every 10 days except for rainy days tdr tubes were installed at 10 20 and 70 cm away from the plant the soil water content was measured at 10 20 40 60 80 and 100 cm with 3 sampling locations for each tube at the same time the soil water content under the apple trees that were not irrigated was also measured as a control group the average soil water content θ is as follows 1 θ v w c i s d i s d i where vwc i and sd i are the soil water content and soil layer thickness mm of each layer respectively during the experiment the end valve kept open to drain the water from the tank and lateral at the end of the growth period from may to october after the end of the 2 year trial 50 emitters from only 2 laterals fig 1 b were randomly selected the place 1 m away from the side of the tree was excavated to determine the position of the emitter for reducing the damage to the root system when the excavation was finished the soil was backfilled and each emitter was sealed in a bag for the next test 2 2 the discharge of emitter discharge is an important indicator to evaluate the degree of clogging of the emitter once emitters were dug out 10 emitters were placed on a platform of the hydraulic performance test to measure the discharge fig 2 the end valve in the test of the hydraulic platform in fig 2 was closed and the water only flowed from the emitter the working pressure of 2 kpa was controlled by the height difference between the piezometric tube in the mariotte bottle and the emitter in order to better judge the blockage the discharge of each emitter was measured 3 times for half an hour per each test and a value averaged over 3 measurements was obtained as the final discharge for each emitter the discharged water was collected in a cup that is weighed at 0 01 g accuracy using an electronic balance and unified treatment of water the emitter performance is evaluated by the relative discharge q po that is calculated by eq 2 2 q p o q i q 0 100 where i is the serial number of the emitters q i is the discharge of the i th emitter l h 1 and q 0 is the average discharge of non used emitters 0 09 l h 1 in this study the mean discharge of 25 emitters under 2 kpa the standard deviation is 0 04 2 3 analysis of emitter clogging since the working pressure of the emitter in the yield and discharge test were 2 kpa the discharge test didn t induce clogging after the discharge test the 10 emitters also were used to analyze emitter clogging to verify the emitter clogging the deposition thickness clogging position the types of organism and clogging composition were measured in order to prevent the sample from polluting the clogging composition during the experiment the part of the emitter was reserved when measuring the thickness as shown in the fig 3 from the surface boundary of the clogging substance to the inner wall of the emitter zeiss axio scope a1 mat material metallographic microscope in this study the thickness of the adhesion layer for 10 emitters was measured by the image processing software digitizer at 3 positions within each emitter and measured 5 times per position to ensure the thickness less affected by sampling the averaged thickness of 5 measurements was taken as the thickness of the position and the averaged thickness of the 3 positions was taken as the thickness of the adhesion layer of the emitter to reduce the accidental error a small cutting machine was used to dissect the emitter during the experiment some powders adhered to the edge of the emitter during the dissection were excluded to avoid interfering with the experimental results in addition this study used a random sampling method to detect the position of micro pore clogging there were two parts to collect the information 1 the inlet of the emitter fig 4 1 and 2 the outlet of the emitter fig 4 2 they were used to make a sem scanning electron microscope nano sem 450 observation sample to obtain a digital image acquisition composition analysis was also conducted for the clogging substances attached to the inner wall of the ceramic emitter and the composition in a dried condition was scanned by the x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 advance a25 angle multiple linear 0 0001 goniometer radius 200 mm angle range 10 80 the internal clogging substances of 3 emitters were taken and grinded them into powder for composition analysis the obtained polycrystalline diffraction image was qualitatively analyzed using an analysis software mdi jade 6 for xrd software application to determine the composition of the clogging substances at the same time the clogging substances shown in the image were subjected to an energy spectrum analysis to determine its constituents moreover the clogging substance of emitters were mixed together for the types of microorganisms testing we divided the collected biofilms into 3 samples randomly and equally they were tested for the phospholipid fatty acids plfas to get the types of microorganisms testing methods were based on details described by zhou et al 2013 plfas biomarkers of indicated microorganisms also referred to zhou et al 2013 2 4 anti clogging experiment in the field test since no suitable flushing method has been studied the lateral was not flushed and only the end valve was opened after the end of the fertility period to drain the water in the lateral therefore an efficient flushing mode is needed to solve the emitter clogging in the field experiment the test platform for flushing was that replaces the markov bottle with a pump and loads a pressure gauge to control head pressure fig 2 at present the traditional flushing pressure is 300 500 kpa yu et al 2018 puig bargues et al 2010 however the ceramic emitter and the lateral were connected by viscous glue and the maximum pressure at the connection cannot exceed 100 kpa in order to reduce the emitter clogging to the greatest extent the flushing test was implemented with a pressure of 100 kpa with 10 emitters per group for testing and 4 groups at the same time the flushing water used in this study was acid added water ph 6 it is not harmful to the field environment to improve the flushing efficiency as the flow passage area of the ceramic emitter is large this study tested various flush times to select the appropriate flushing time by gradually increasing the flushing time i e 3 min 10 min 15 min and 20 min in irrigation depending on the ph value measured before the experiment hcl 0 1 mol l 1 was added to the water to obtain the designed ph value during the acidification process repeated water cycles increased the possibility of acid consumption whenever the acid was injected a ph meter was used to measure the ph value in water every 3 min the designed ph value was maintained by injecting the amount of acid during the acidification process based on ph monitoring by the acidity meter the efficiency of flushing time on the emitters was evaluated corresponding to the recovery rate of the discharge once the flushing was completed the discharge after the emitter flushing was still measured by a device refer to 2 2 with some adjustments when the discharge of each emitter was measured the average discharge of the emitters was employed as a flow indicator of each emitter type to fairly compare the changes of the discharge the discharge available for the flushed emitter was obtained from the 2 pressures of 2 kpa and 5 kpa at the same time the selected emitter sample was scrutinized with an electron microscope after the lateral was flushed this test may provide a certain reference as to how much the clogged emitter discharge can increase for subsequent field tests 3 results 3 1 emitter performance fig 5 shows that the relative discharge q po of the porous ceramic emitters that were operated for a period of time it is found that the relative value is below 20 for the emitters iso 2003 specifies that the emitter relative discharge below 25 30 may cause serious clogging indicating that the emitters used in this study are severely clogged the reason for the discharge decreased is that there is a blockage in the emitter eq 3 shows the linear relationship between emitter discharge and the thickness of the adhesion layer even though the porous ceramic emitter is composed of a porous structure that provides many flow channels and many possibilities of outflow the discharge of the emitter decreases gradually with an increase in thickness generally speaking an irrigation system operated for a while usually may cause the thicker layer deposition of clogging substances researches showed that the low flow velocity caused more deposits in the pipeline due to a reduced shear stress of water mietta et al 2009 douterelo et al 2012 under the working pressure 2 5 kpa 0 09 l h 1 and 0 18 l h 1 respectively used in this study the velocity was very low 7 9 10 5 m s 1 and 15 8 10 5 m s 1 respectively resulting in more substance deposit in the emitter because the emitter is equivalent to a filter which causes different clogging degrees of the emitters moreover the clogging substances are difficult to remove due to low discharge rate park et al 2011 paul et al 2012 consequently there is a thick adhesive layer in the inside of the porous ceramic emitter 3 q 0 0234 t 0 0197 r 2 0 9297 p 0 004 where q is the discharge of emitter l h 1 t is the thickness of the adhesion layer mm r 2 is the goodness of fit p 0 05 means significant 3 2 clogging position during the experiment clogging occurred in the emitter fig 6 shows microscopic photo of the sampling of emitters at different positions the brand new emitter s pores are clearly shown in fig 6 a at the inlet of the clogged emitter fig 6 b the clogging substances clogged the pores and there were some filamentous fibers in contrast at emitter outlet more fine particles were found on the pores as shown in fig 6 c because the soil s particles attached to the emitter surface the micro pores were clearly visible without substances clogged when away from the boundary as the same with the inlet of the clogged emitter the clogging of porous media is more complicated than a labyrinth path because of the deepening of flow channels the low discharge rate causes a slower transfer rate of nutrients and subsequently solid particulate matters at the inlet are more abundant than the outlet of the emitter the micropores are not capable of providing suitable growth space and nutrients zhou et al 2014 the pores inside the emitter were clearly visible such results indicate that the main trigger of the emitter clogging is the adhesion layer and clogging substance in the pores the reason why there are so many clogging substances inside the emitter is the presence of nutrients and microorganisms in the water the rise in temperature affects the quality of the water under the local temperature of 11 25 c during the irrigation season the biological activity in the water is stronger causing more serious blockages tong et al 2019 sanz lázaro et al 2015 3 3 clogging composition fig 7 demonstrates the composition of clogging substance it is found that sio2 accounted for the highest portion in the inorganic crystal among the crystal components mainly due to the presence of particles in the water the clogging substances were also composed of caco3 mgal2o4 an analysis of elemental composition also shows that c o and si are relatively high while the clogging substances contained little fe cl and k table 2 besides the clogging substance mainly contained bacteria 14 0 i15 0 i16 0 16 1 7t 16 1 9t 17 0 i17 0 a17 0 18 0 18 1 7c and 20 0 fungus 18 2w6 9c microalgae 16 3w3 they grow and secrete plfas which constituted biological clogging zhou et al 2013 it is worth noting that the clogging substances contain both fe2 and ca2 that promote the production of microorganisms and precipitation of solid particles resulting in increasing the risk of clogging hao et al 2017 3 4 anti clogging method the capacity of discharge recovery is closely dependent on flush times as shown in fig 8 for a short flushing time i e 3 min 10 min the adhesion layer was not removed effectively and resulted less discharge of the emitter given a longer 15 min flushing time for example the discharge was 0 046 l h 1 at 2 kpa and the corresponding discharge recovery rate was only 51 11 compared to the non used emitter discharge moreover the discharge recovery rate was 75 56 under 5 kpa emitter discharge after flushed has been improved and this result indicates that the discharge recovery rate of the emitter can be improved as the working pressure increases unfortunately a longer flushing time is not always effective to solve the clogging of the emitter the discharge recovery rate not improved significantly although the flushing time increased by 20 min it was recommended to apply 15 min flushing time at 100 kpa to effectively improve the emitter discharge 4 discussion as the increase of time the emitter gradually became clogged the soil water content after irrigation was close to that in the non irrigated soil in the second year as shown in fig 9 research shows that the maximum water requirement for the apple trees should be 80 of the field capacity 0 25 cm3 cm 3 xu et al 2016 in the fig 9 the soil water content is greater than 20 even when the emitter was clogged which is still above the maximum requirement of the soil water content for the apple trees this indicates that porous ceramic emitter can still provide some water needed for apple trees after 2 years of operation it seems to indicate that the relative discharge to evaluate the emitter clogging may be not suitable for the porous ceramic emitters at the same time we sampled the soil water content on different weather conditions sunny day cloud cover less than 10 and rainfall in second year fig 10 even in sunny day the soil water content can meet the apple tree s growth conditions within the range of soil depth of 0 60 cm since the emitter discharge is considerably sensitive to the change of pressure cai et al 2018 when the emitter discharge is greater than the infiltration rate of the soil the soil produces a positive pressure that further suppresses the outflow of the emitter wu et al 2004a 2004b also pointed out that the positive pressure of the soil could reach 0 15 mpa which was greater than the working pressure of the emitter given that a stable level of the soil water content causes a small discharge of the emitter the emitter discharge in the soil can be less than a designed discharge in a long term stable environment however ceramic irrigation systems always continuously provide part of the irrigation water to the soil over time even the emitter discharge is small such result indicates that continuous irrigation from the porous ceramic emitters may reduce the deviation of soil water content caused by emitter clogging instead the uniformity of the soil water content in a certain period of time might be a better index to evaluate the irrigation quality to reduce the requirement for the deviation of discharge even if the porous ceramic emitter can provide enough irrigation water for crops when it is clogged it is still necessary to solve the blockage for the good operation of the system lateral flushing removes sediments accumulated within lateral these sediments will not clog emitters however the pore clogging substances still remain in the micropore even after the flushing we have tested 10 samples of flushed emitters and found that there were some clogging substances in the pores of the emitter fig 11 compared to a clean emitter fig 6 a which explains the reason that the discharge improved less than expected the flushing time effectively reduces the substance deposited on the inner wall of the emitter but it was difficult to achieve effective removal of the substance in the micropores the clogging substance continues to prevent the flow of water from the inlet to the outlet it is difficult to restore the emitter discharge as much as a non used emitter discharge besides the inside of the porous ceramic emitter consists of a number of capillary channels that have a strong adsorption effect tang et al 2018 the air in the water is absorbed into the inner wall which deteriorates the discharge rate by reducing the capacity of the flow channel lazouskaya and jin 2008 at the same time gas accumulation occurs on the surface of the channel from co2 produced by the respiration of the organism e g aeruginosa fungus when biological respiration produces co2 it dissolves in water to form hco3 and the ph of the water is slightly alkaline forming co32 and ca2 in the water reacted with it to form caco3 which exacerbated the blockage meanwhile han et al 2019 found that the presence of gas water interfaces mixed gas water fluids clearly promoted pore clogging because finer particles are readily collected at the gas water interfaces resulting in high particle concentration at the same time the substances accumulated in deep inside of the micropores are not removed efficiently the emitter used in this study had a wall thickness of 2 cm the internal structure is intricate and not uniform zhou et al 2020 given that the pressure presses clogging substances accumulated in the inside of the emitter the more clogging is likely to occur due to the change in the pore size salvatore citoa 2012 therefore it s necessary to explore the frequency of flushing laterals during irrigation in addition antagonistic microorganisms have an influence on reducing emitter clogging and it provides a better way to suppress the clogging of the porous ceramic emitters sahin et al 2005 5 conclusions this paper mainly analyzed the causes of the clogging for the porous ceramic emitters and suggested suitable solutions the results of this study were about 75 clogging occurred inside the emitter continuously operated for two years in the field test subsequently causing less discharge for the apple trees the relationship between the thickness of the adhesion layer and the of emitter discharge was congruous with a linear relationship which is one of the reasons that the emitter discharge decreased however the continuous irrigation with the ceramic emitters enhanced the capacity to keep a certain level of soil moisture when the emitter flowed out the substances in the water were precipitated at the inlet of the emitter in contrast to the micropores of the outlet of emitter clogging substances were only found at the inlet pores of the emitter the clogging substances were mainly contained sio2 caco3 and mgal2o4 and the element fe cl and k further the clogging substances contained bacteria fungus and microalgae which secrete plfas to form biofilm it was recommended to apply an acid solution with a ph of 6 for the flushing time of 15 min at 100 kpa pressure for the clogged emitter and the discharge could be restored up to 75 56 of the designed discharge under the 5 kpa this method is to reduce blockages for already clogged emitter and future studies need to focus on the frequency of flushing laterals during irrigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

10119,this study was conducted to investigate the effects of colored water pillows on yield and water productivity of two pepper cultivars under greenhouse conditions in 2018 and 2019 irrigation treatments were arranged as drip without mulching black water pillow blue water pillow drip black mulching and drip blue mulching the first year total plant water consumption amount was about 421 mm for drip and 301 mm for the other treatments and respectively as 439 and 305 mm in the second year in both years approximately 38 less water was applied in water pillow irrigation treatments significant differences were not observed in yields of water pillow and drip mulching treatments but drip irrigation treatments were found to be significantly different from the other treatments in both years for captain capia and yellow stone chili pepper cultivars as the average of two years the highest yields were obtained from water pillow treatments as 39 65 and 32 3 t ha 1 respectively and the lowest yields were obtained from the drip irrigation treatments as 28 9 and 22 7 t ha 1 there were significant differences in irrigation water productivity iwp and water productivity wp values of drip irrigation and the other treatments for captain capia and yellow stone chili pepper as the average of two years the highest iwp values were obtained from the water pillow treatments as 121 3 and 96 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 and the lowest iwp value was obtained from the drip irrigation treatments as 65 kg ha 1 mm 1 similarly the highest wp values were obtained from the water pillow treatments as 129 5 and 103 25 kg ha 1 mm 1 and the lowest wp value was obtained from the drip treatments as 52 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 a great energy saving was achieved with water pillow method the amount of energy used in water pillow was about 2 and 5 of the energy used in drip and drip mulching treatments respectively in both years water pillow and drip mulching treatments had higher soil temperatures than drip treatment as 1 3 c weeds were not encountered in water pillows and drip mulching treatments in conclusion present findings revealed that water pillows were clearly superior to drip irrigation although yield values of water pillows and drip mulching treatments were not significantly different no extra energy demand inherent mulching characteristics and quite low labor costs have made water pillows more advantages over drip mulching treatments keywords water pillow irrigation pepper water productivity energy saving weed control 1 introduction pepper is largely grown worldwide and consumed in various ways in 2018 world annual pepper production was 36 4 million tons and annual pepper production of turkey was 2 7 million tons anonymous 2020a 2020b irrigation is the primary input in agricultural production activities to increase yield levels quite higher irrigation efficiencies and yields are achieved when drip irrigation was used together with mulching paul et al 2013 mulch is defined as organic or inorganic materials covering the soil surface and it has several benefits in agricultural production activities ramakrishna et al 2006 mulching prevents evaporations from the plant root zone thus allows more efficient use of irrigation water decelerates upward movement of salts at different depths of soil profile thus prevents salinity formation in soils qi et al 2018 prevents weed growth and development nwosisi et al 2019 mulching also protects soils against water and wind erosion cong et al 2016 reduces direct exposure to sunlight and keeps soil moisture thus stimulates soil biological activity jabran 2019 organic mulching materials decompose in time and thus improve soil physical chemical and biological characteristics and enrich soils in humus and organic matter ranjan et al 2017 dark color mulching materials increase soil temperature then improve root development yield and quality tegen et al 2015 since the soil is continuously moist plants spend less energy for water intake and such a case then reflects in yield and quality fan et al 2016 since soil moisture is kept for a long time within the root zone total irrigation water quantity is reduced and irrigation interval is increased schonbeck and evanylo 2008 colored plastic mulching materials have positive effects on plant yield and quality franquera and mabesa 2016 water pillows are combined application of drip and mulching and offer the benefits of both drip and mulching with a single system gerçek 2006 resistant and soft plastic pipes are so called as water pillows diameters of the pipes change based on plant row spacing water plows are placed between the plant rows seepage holes 1 mm in diameter are provided along the center line of the bottom surface of the pipes in contact with soil surface hole spacing varies between 50 and 100 cm based on plant species water is filled into plastic pipes then head and end sections are knotted tightly water infiltrates from the holes into the soil profile with gravity there is no need for an extra pressure supply as it was in drip irrigation a descending flow regime is demonstrated based on the amount of water in pillow since irrigation water is filled into plastic water pillows there is no direct contact of water with the soil thus soil erosion is not experienced in this method as it was in surface irrigation methods although this novel irrigation method is quite similar to drip irrigation there is no need for extra pressure for the operation of the system therefore the method is quite a hybrid of pressurized irrigation and surface irrigation methods gerçek et al 2017 in previous studies water pillows were compared to furrow irrigation and superior yield water use efficiency weed control and economics of water pillows were put forth in soybean gerçek et al 2009a pepper gerçek et al 2009b and maize gerçek and okant 2010 later on drip and drip mulching treatments were compared in tomato gerçek et al 2017 altunlu et al 2017 and eggplant gerçek and demirkaya 2020 those studies revealed the advantages of drip mulching treatments in terms of yield efficient water use weed control irrigation labor energy consumption and irrigation economics the yellow stone chili pepper capsicum annuum l cv chili var yellow stone is a medium early cultivar and has strong plant structure captain capia pepper capsicum annuum l cv capia var captain has a thick fruit flesh and used either for fresh consumption or paste and canned food production the effects of colored water pillows on captain capia and yellow stone chili pepper cultivars have not been investigated before therefore this study was conducted to investigate the effects of blue and black water pillows on yield and water use efficiency of yellow stone chili pepper and captain capia pepper cultivars drip blue and black mulching treatments were compared with single drip irrigation treatments under greenhouse conditions 2 material and method 2 1 experimental site experiments were conducted in 10 20 m venlo type east west oriented polycarbonate greenhouse of the experiment and research center at safiye çıkrıkçıoğlu

of may in the first year and 11th of may in the second year in both years a total of 25 mm irrigation water was applied to all seedlings in 3 day intervals to have a better seedling development throughout the initial growth stages the cultural practices performed throughout the experiments are provided in table 3 experiments were conducted in randomized blocks design with four replications 2 3 irrigations and measurements in drip irrigation treatments in line drippers with a discharge of 4 l h 1 were spaced 30 cm apart within the lateral lines in drip mulching treatments two lateral lines were placed beneath the mulching materials covering the entire plot surface for the water pillow treatments soil surface was leveled to get an equal water distribution in the water pillow treatments two elastic plastic pipes were used and the space between the rows was covered with the same color mulching material in other words both in drip mulching treatments and water pillow treatments soil surface was fully covered with mulching materials the uv reinforced plastic pipes of mulching and water pillow treatments had a wall thickness of 0 3 mm in plastic pipes installed in water pillow treatments 1 mm diameter holes were opened along the middle bottom section at 50 cm spacing irrigation water infiltrated into the soil through leakage from these holes initial maximum flow rate of these holes was 2 12 l h 1 and such a value decreased in time based on hydraulic load in plastic pipe such a case resulted in having shallow root distribution in water pillow treatments since drip treatments had a constant dripper discharge irrigation water infiltrated deeper in soil profile than the water pillow treatments irrigation interval was selected as 5 days in drip treatments and 10 days in water pillows and drip mulching treatments gerçek et al 2017 mulching materials for the drip treatments and plastic pipes of water pillows were placed on 10th of june in the first year and 4th

compared with the use of lsd least significant difference test at 5 significance level 3 result and discussion 3 1 yields yield values of pepper cultivars are provided in table 4 in the first year the highest yield in captan capia peppers was obtained from drip blue mulching treatments 38 7 t ha 1 and the highest yield in yellow stone chili peppers was obtained from blue water pillow treatments 33 8 t ha 1 the lowest yields in both pepper cultivars were obtained from drip irrigation treatments 27 3 and 22 0 t black and blue water pillow treatments had about 35 greater captain capia pepper yields than drip treatments such a difference was 36 in drip black and blue mulching treatments a similar case is also valid for yellow stone chili pepper cultivar black and blue water pillows drip black and blue mulching treatments had around 44 greater yield per hectare values than drip treatment in the second year the highest yields were obtained from black water pillow treatments 42 7 t ha 1 in captain capia peppers and from drip black mulching treatments 31 7 t ha 1 in yellow stone chili peppers as it was in the first year the lowest yields in both cultivars were obtained from drip irrigation treatments 30 5 and 23 4 t as compared to drip irrigation in captain capia pepper cultivar a yield increase of 37 was achieved with black and blue water pillows and a yield increase of 31 was achieved with drip black and blue mulching treatments such increases in yellow stone pepper cultivar were respectively measured as 32 and 31 black and blue water pillow and drip black and blue mulching treatments clearly had quite greater yield per plant number of fruits per plant and m2 values than drip treatments it was clear that drip treatments had quite lower yields than other treatments and significantly different values as the average of two years the highest yields in captain capia and yellow stone chili pepper cultivars were obtained from water pillow treatments respectively with 39 2 and 31 3 t ha 1 such yield values were about 2 greater than the yields in drip mulching treatments the difference was quite small and insignificant p 0 05 effects of black and blue colors on yield were not significantly different however mean yields in black color treatments were about 2 higher than the yields in blue color treatments such a case indicated that black and blue water pillows had similar effects on soil and plants with drip black and blue mulching treatments the difference in yields of captain capia and yellow stone chili peppers was attributed to cultivar characteristics yield increase in colored water pillows and drip colored mulching treatments was mostly resulted from mulching effects such increases in yields were mostly attributed to mulching materials since plastic mulching covered the entire soil surface prevented moisture loss zhanga et al 2017 increased soil temperature zhao et al 2012 suppresses weed growth li et al 2020 improved microbial activity within the root zone and thus stimulated root growth and development kader et al 2017 a good root growth allowed plants to take sufficient water and nutrients then improved yield and quality fageria and moreira 2011 liang et al 2011 rahman et al 2005 reported total root weight as 1686 g for mulching treatments and 697 g for non mulched treatments such a difference in root structure influenced yields and about 45 increase was achieved in yield per hectare lópez et al 2007 reported yield per hectare of jalapeno pepper cultivar as 20 52 tons for drip and 27 44 tons for drip mulching treatment about 34 increase was achieved with mulching positive effects of colored mulching materials on yield were reported in previous studies rajablariani et al 2012 reported significant effects of transparent blue black red and silver color mulching materials on tomato yield and had the highest yield from blue and black mulching materials black colored mulching materials absorb sunlight the most prevent weed development increase soil temperature then provide the best growth ambient zhanga et al 2017 bora and babu 2014 reported about 21 greater tomato yield for drip black mulching treatments than for plain drip without mulching gerçek et al 2017 compared black mulching water pillow treatments with drip without mulching despite 52 less water application water pillows had 18 greater yield than drip irrigation colored mulching materials may have different effects on different plants gordon et al 2010 in a previous study effects of black and blue water pillows drip mulching and drip treatments on eggplant yields were investigated and 29 more yield was reported for black and blue water pillows as compared to drip irrigation but differences between the yields of different colors were not found to be significant gerçek and demirkaya 2020 ashrafuzzaman et al 2011 reported pepper yield as 13 4 t ha 1 for non mulched treatment 21 33 t ha 1 for black mulching treatment and 19 15 t ha 1 for blue mulching treatment in present study effects of black and blue water pillows and mulching materials were not significantly different 3 2 irrigation and water productivity in the first year 439 mm irrigation water was applied in drip treatments and 318 mm was applied in the other treatments in the second year 452 mm was applied in drip treatment and 328 mm was applied in the other treatments the differences between drip treatment and water pillows and drip mulching treatments was 121 mm in the first year and 124 mm in the second year in both years about 38 less water was applied in water pillows and drip mulching treatments plant water consumption is the sum of transpiration from the plant surfaces and evaporation from the soil surface it was calculated as 421 mm for drip treatment and 301 mm for the other treatments in the first year and respectively as 439 and 305 mm in the second year the difference in plant water consumptions between drip and the other treatments was measured as 120 mm in the first year and 134 mm in the second year as the average of two years plant water consumption was 30 lower in water pillows and drip mulching treatments since mulching prevented evaporations from the soil surface such a significant difference was encountered superior yields of water pillows and drip mulching treatments to drip irrigation treatments indicated that there were not any water deficiencies in these treatments thusly pre irrigation soil moisture levels varied between 20 and 22 in these treatments and between 18 and 20 in drip irrigation treatments kader et al 2017 indicated that mulching largely prevented evaporation from the soil thus reduced capillary rise from the lower layers and preserved soil moisture within the root zone for longer durations li et al 2013 reported that plastic mulching materials reduced total plant water consumption of maize by about 35 present findings well comply with the results of earlier studies despite less water use about 35 increase was achieved in yield of both cultivars irrigation durations vary based on the applied irrigation water quantities in drip irrigation treatments average irrigation duration in 2018 and 2019 was respectively identified as 68 and 64 min and total duration was respectively identified as 1972 and 2048 min in drip mulching treatments average irrigation duration was 57 min in the first year and 54 min in the second year total irrigation duration was 855 min in the first year and 864 min in the second year the amount of energy used in drip mulching treatments was 43 lower than the amount used in drip irrigation such an advantage was totally attributed to mulching material quite a short irrigation duration is the leading advantage of water pillows in water pillows the only thing an irrigator should do is to fill the water pillows irrigation duration was considered as the duration in which water was discharged from the drippers in drip irrigation and as the duration in which water pillows were filled with water in water pillows depending on water flow rate into the pillows therefore irrigation duration is quite low in water pillows in water pillow treatments average irrigation and total seasonal duration were about 3 and 42 min in both years the amount of energy used in water pillows was about 2 of the energy used in drip irrigation such a value was 5 of the energy used in drip mulching treatments there is a vast saving in energy with water pillows since there is no contact between the water and the soil while filling water pillows there is no problem of water erosion or surface runoff this water then leaks through the holes provided on plastic pipes such a leakage may take 24 h in some cases the issue to be pointed out here in is the much more energy use in drip and drip mulching treatments and almost zero energy use in water pillows since water is discharged gravimetrically in water pillows as it was in surface irrigation therefore there is no need for extra energy mulching is an option in drip irrigation and requires extra cost in water pillows plastic pipes serve both an irrigation tool and mulching material therefore mulching is an inherent characteristic of water pillow irrigation method thus does not constitute any extra costs such a case makes water pillows method more economic than drip method optimum use of energy is a significant issue in all sectors to decelerate global warming and to mitigate potential effects of climate change either solar or wind like renewable energy sources should be used or efficiency of fossil fuels should be improved daniel et al 2004 while there is a need for pump thus energy to supply a constant pressure and flow in drip irrigation there is no need for additional energy in water pillows gerçek et al 2009a 2009b gerçek et al 2017 irrigation water productivity iwp and water productivity wp values varied with the years and cultivars table 4 in the first year for captain capia pepper the highest and the lowest iwp values were obtained from drip blue mulching and drip treatments respectively for yellow stone chili pepper the highest and lowest iwp values were obtained from blue water pillow and drip treatments respectively the lowest wp value in captain capia and yellow stone chili pepper cultivar was obtained from drip treatments and the highest respectively from drip blue mulching and blue water pillow treatments in the second year in both pepper cultivars the lowest iwp and wp values were obtained from drip treatments the highest iwp value was obtained from black water pillow treatment in captain capia pepper cultivar and from drip black mulching treatment in yellow stone chili pepper cultivar the highest wp value was obtained from black water pillow treatment in captain capia pepper and from drip black mulching treatment in yellow stone chili pepper while there were significant differences in iwp and wp values of drip treatments and the other treatments the differences in iwp and wp values of water pillow and drip mulching treatments were not found to be significant p 0 05 present findings clearly revealed that mulching materials preserved soil moisture and improved yield levels therefore as compared to drip without mulching mulching materials yielded quite greater iwp and wp values in a previous study conducted to investigate the effects of water pillows and furrow irrigation on soybean water productivity value was calculated as 2 70 kg ha 1 mm 1 for water pillows and 1 63 kg ha 1 mm 1 for furrow irrigation gerçek et al 2009a in another study on peppers water productivity value of furrow and water pillows were respectively calculated as 18 2 and 33 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 mulching effect of water pillows increased water productivity by 60 as compared to furrow irrigation gercek et al 2009b water productivity of non mulched drip and furrow irrigation in pepper plants were respectively reported as 17 7 and 10 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 antony and singandhupe 2004 liang et al 2011 conducted a study with pepper plants under greenhouse conditions and reported water productivity value as 261 kg ha 1 mm 1 for drip mulching and 132 kg ha 1 mm 1 for drip treatments all these findings revealed that drip mulching increased water productivity values by about 50 65 present findings agree with those earlier ones similar cases are also valid for irrigation water productivity 3 3 soil temperatures soil temperatures at 10 cm depth for all treatments are provided in table 5 the lowest average soil temperature was measured in drip treatment and the highest values were measured in black water pillows and black mulching treatments in both years water pillow and drip mulching treatments had higher soil temperatures than drip treatment the average hottest temperatures were measured in july and august in both years in the first year the average temperature for these months was 30 2 c for drip irrigation while it was 31 1 31 4 c for water pillows and drip mulching treatments there was 1 2 c temperature difference between drip and black water pillow and drip black mulching and 0 9 c between drip and blue water pillow and drip blue mulching treatments similar findings were also observed in the other months and the second year in both years greater soil temperatures were measured in black water pillow and drip black mulching treatments than in blue water pillow and drip blue mulching treatments black colored water pillows absorbed more solar rays than blue colored water pillows therefore soil temperatures in black water pillow and drip black mulching treatments were greater than in blue water pillow treatments this difference had a positive effect on crop yields several researchers indicated that black mulching increased soil temperature and thus had positive effects on plant yields zhao et al 2012 emphasized that soil temperature was 2 9 c higher in black mulching treatments than in non mulched treatments potato yield was found to be 1820 kg ha 1 higher than non mulched treatments tesfaye et al 2016 compared the effects of black blue and clear mulches on tomato yield and soil temperatures with the control bare treatments and reported significant increases in soil temperature and yields with mulching treatments in present study soil temperatures both in water pillow and drip mulching treatments were higher than in drip treatments without mulching then such increasing temperatures might have increased yields 3 4 weeds since black and blue mulching materials of water pillows and drip mulching treatments did not pass sun light photosynthesis of weeds was prevented and thus weed development was not observed in these treatments fig 2 zhang et al 1992 reported that black plastic film mulch resulted in 100 control of all the weeds in maize that supported the present experimental result weeds were encountered only in drip irrigation treatments in present experimental greenhouse heliotropium europaeum l seteria glauca l beauv portulaca oleracea l amaranthus retroﬂexus l chenopodium album l agropyron repens l beauv poa annua l convolvulus arvensis l mercurialis annua l and tribulus terrestris l weed species were encountered these species are common species of the region encountered throughout the experimental season isık et al 2009 weed control was practiced manually with the use of simple mechanic tools and herbicides were not used it is possible to damage pepper roots during the weed control plants spend extra energy to repair damaged roots and such an effort may have negative effects on yield thusly in a previous study significant differences were reported in root distribution of mulched and non mulched irrigation treatments goyal et al 1988 weed control is a laborsome and a costly process weeds also take up soil water and nutrients to grow and compete with main crops for water and nutrients thus reduce yield levels ronchi et al 2007 reported that weed roots competed with coffee roots accordingly coffee roots stored more nutrients and such a case then negatively influenced coffee yields previous studies also reported prevention of weed growth with black and dark colored mulching materials covering the soil surface rajablariani et al 2012 tolasa and eshetu 2014 prevention of weed development was also reported in studies conducted with water pillows çömlekçioğlu et al 2008 gerçek et al 2009a 2009b gerçek et al 2017 altunlu et al 2017 gerçek and demirkaya 2020 4 conclusions optimum use of water resources is an essential component of sustainable agriculture pressurized irrigation methods and mulching materials should be used to improve water use efficiency drip irrigation systems have a high initial investment cost mulching also brings an extra cost to irrigation investments mulching is not an inherent component of drip irrigation it is totally up to the farmer energy is an essential component of drip irrigation for system operation water pillows as a new method of irrigation have various advantages over drip irrigation the yield values of drip mulching treatments were similar with the values of water pillows present findings revealed that water pillows and drip mulching treatments were clearly superior to drip irrigation although yield values of water pillows and drip mulching treatments were not significantly different no extra energy demand inherent mulching characteristics and quite low labor costs have made water pillows more advantages over drip mulching treatments on the other hand water pillows irrigation is quite cheaper and easier to apply than drip irrigation inhering mulching material nature of the water pillows undoubtedly makes the pillows a pioneering method of irrigation previous studies also put forth the advantages of water pillows over furrow and drip irrigation further research is recommended to investigate the effects of water pillows on salt distribution within soil profile and the effects of saline irrigation waters through water pillows on yield and soil properties declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10119,this study was conducted to investigate the effects of colored water pillows on yield and water productivity of two pepper cultivars under greenhouse conditions in 2018 and 2019 irrigation treatments were arranged as drip without mulching black water pillow blue water pillow drip black mulching and drip blue mulching the first year total plant water consumption amount was about 421 mm for drip and 301 mm for the other treatments and respectively as 439 and 305 mm in the second year in both years approximately 38 less water was applied in water pillow irrigation treatments significant differences were not observed in yields of water pillow and drip mulching treatments but drip irrigation treatments were found to be significantly different from the other treatments in both years for captain capia and yellow stone chili pepper cultivars as the average of two years the highest yields were obtained from water pillow treatments as 39 65 and 32 3 t ha 1 respectively and the lowest yields were obtained from the drip irrigation treatments as 28 9 and 22 7 t ha 1 there were significant differences in irrigation water productivity iwp and water productivity wp values of drip irrigation and the other treatments for captain capia and yellow stone chili pepper as the average of two years the highest iwp values were obtained from the water pillow treatments as 121 3 and 96 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 and the lowest iwp value was obtained from the drip irrigation treatments as 65 kg ha 1 mm 1 similarly the highest wp values were obtained from the water pillow treatments as 129 5 and 103 25 kg ha 1 mm 1 and the lowest wp value was obtained from the drip treatments as 52 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 a great energy saving was achieved with water pillow method the amount of energy used in water pillow was about 2 and 5 of the energy used in drip and drip mulching treatments respectively in both years water pillow and drip mulching treatments had higher soil temperatures than drip treatment as 1 3 c weeds were not encountered in water pillows and drip mulching treatments in conclusion present findings revealed that water pillows were clearly superior to drip irrigation although yield values of water pillows and drip mulching treatments were not significantly different no extra energy demand inherent mulching characteristics and quite low labor costs have made water pillows more advantages over drip mulching treatments keywords water pillow irrigation pepper water productivity energy saving weed control 1 introduction pepper is largely grown worldwide and consumed in various ways in 2018 world annual pepper production was 36 4 million tons and annual pepper production of turkey was 2 7 million tons anonymous 2020a 2020b irrigation is the primary input in agricultural production activities to increase yield levels quite higher irrigation efficiencies and yields are achieved when drip irrigation was used together with mulching paul et al 2013 mulch is defined as organic or inorganic materials covering the soil surface and it has several benefits in agricultural production activities ramakrishna et al 2006 mulching prevents evaporations from the plant root zone thus allows more efficient use of irrigation water decelerates upward movement of salts at different depths of soil profile thus prevents salinity formation in soils qi et al 2018 prevents weed growth and development nwosisi et al 2019 mulching also protects soils against water and wind erosion cong et al 2016 reduces direct exposure to sunlight and keeps soil moisture thus stimulates soil biological activity jabran 2019 organic mulching materials decompose in time and thus improve soil physical chemical and biological characteristics and enrich soils in humus and organic matter ranjan et al 2017 dark color mulching materials increase soil temperature then improve root development yield and quality tegen et al 2015 since the soil is continuously moist plants spend less energy for water intake and such a case then reflects in yield and quality fan et al 2016 since soil moisture is kept for a long time within the root zone total irrigation water quantity is reduced and irrigation interval is increased schonbeck and evanylo 2008 colored plastic mulching materials have positive effects on plant yield and quality franquera and mabesa 2016 water pillows are combined application of drip and mulching and offer the benefits of both drip and mulching with a single system gerçek 2006 resistant and soft plastic pipes are so called as water pillows diameters of the pipes change based on plant row spacing water plows are placed between the plant rows seepage holes 1 mm in diameter are provided along the center line of the bottom surface of the pipes in contact with soil surface hole spacing varies between 50 and 100 cm based on plant species water is filled into plastic pipes then head and end sections are knotted tightly water infiltrates from the holes into the soil profile with gravity there is no need for an extra pressure supply as it was in drip irrigation a descending flow regime is demonstrated based on the amount of water in pillow since irrigation water is filled into plastic water pillows there is no direct contact of water with the soil thus soil erosion is not experienced in this method as it was in surface irrigation methods although this novel irrigation method is quite similar to drip irrigation there is no need for extra pressure for the operation of the system therefore the method is quite a hybrid of pressurized irrigation and surface irrigation methods gerçek et al 2017 in previous studies water pillows were compared to furrow irrigation and superior yield water use efficiency weed control and economics of water pillows were put forth in soybean gerçek et al 2009a pepper gerçek et al 2009b and maize gerçek and okant 2010 later on drip and drip mulching treatments were compared in tomato gerçek et al 2017 altunlu et al 2017 and eggplant gerçek and demirkaya 2020 those studies revealed the advantages of drip mulching treatments in terms of yield efficient water use weed control irrigation labor energy consumption and irrigation economics the yellow stone chili pepper capsicum annuum l cv chili var yellow stone is a medium early cultivar and has strong plant structure captain capia pepper capsicum annuum l cv capia var captain has a thick fruit flesh and used either for fresh consumption or paste and canned food production the effects of colored water pillows on captain capia and yellow stone chili pepper cultivars have not been investigated before therefore this study was conducted to investigate the effects of blue and black water pillows on yield and water use efficiency of yellow stone chili pepper and captain capia pepper cultivars drip blue and black mulching treatments were compared with single drip irrigation treatments under greenhouse conditions 2 material and method 2 1 experimental site experiments were conducted in 10 20 m venlo type east west oriented polycarbonate greenhouse of the experiment and research center at safiye çıkrıkçıoğlu

terrestrial climate with cold and snowy winters and hot and dry summers is dominant in the region greenhouse indoor temperatures and relative humidity values in 2018 and 2019 were measured hourly with testo 175 data logger placed 1 m above the ground in the middle of the greenhouse table 1 disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were taken from 0 to 30 and 30 60 cm soil depths and physico chemical analysis results are provided in table 2 2 2 experimental design each experimental plot had 3 3 4 2 m dimensions and 4 rows with 32 plants there were 5 different irrigation treatments regular drip

3 irrigations and measurements in drip irrigation treatments in line drippers with a discharge of 4 l h 1 were spaced 30 cm apart within the lateral lines in drip mulching treatments two lateral lines were placed beneath the mulching materials covering the entire plot surface for the water pillow treatments soil surface was leveled to get an equal water distribution in the water pillow treatments two elastic plastic pipes were used and the space between the rows was covered with the same color mulching material in other words both in drip mulching treatments and water pillow treatments soil surface was fully covered with mulching materials the uv reinforced plastic pipes of mulching and water pillow treatments had a wall thickness of 0 3 mm in plastic pipes installed in water pillow treatments 1 mm diameter holes were opened along the middle bottom section at 50 cm spacing irrigation water infiltrated into the soil through leakage from these holes initial maximum flow rate of these holes was 2 12 l h 1 and such a value decreased in time based on hydraulic load in plastic pipe such a case resulted in having shallow root distribution in water pillow treatments since drip treatments had a constant dripper discharge irrigation water infiltrated deeper in soil profile than the water pillow treatments irrigation interval was selected as 5 days in drip treatments and 10 days in water pillows and drip mulching treatments gerçek et al 2017 mulching materials for the drip treatments and plastic pipes of water pillows were placed on 10th of june in the first year and 4th

was achieved with drip black and blue mulching treatments such increases in yellow stone pepper cultivar were respectively measured as 32 and 31 black and blue water pillow and drip black and blue mulching treatments clearly had quite greater yield per plant number of fruits per plant and m2 values than drip treatments it was clear that drip treatments had quite lower yields than other treatments and significantly different values as the average of two years the highest yields in captain capia and yellow stone chili pepper cultivars were obtained from water pillow treatments respectively with 39 2 and 31 3 t ha 1 such yield values were about 2 greater than the yields in drip mulching treatments the difference was quite small and insignificant p 0 05 effects of black and blue colors on yield were not significantly different however mean yields in black color treatments were about 2 higher than the yields in blue color treatments such a case indicated that black and blue water pillows had similar effects on soil and plants with drip black and blue mulching treatments the difference in yields of captain capia and yellow stone chili peppers was attributed to cultivar characteristics yield increase in colored water pillows and drip colored mulching treatments was mostly resulted from mulching effects such increases in yields were mostly attributed to mulching materials since plastic mulching covered the entire soil surface prevented moisture loss zhanga et al 2017 increased soil temperature zhao et al 2012 suppresses weed growth li et al 2020 improved microbial activity within the root zone and thus stimulated root growth and development kader et al 2017 a good root growth allowed plants to take sufficient water and nutrients then improved yield and quality fageria and moreira 2011 liang et al 2011 rahman et al 2005 reported total root weight as 1686 g for mulching treatments and 697 g for non mulched treatments such a difference in root structure influenced yields and about 45 increase was achieved in yield per hectare lópez et al 2007 reported yield per hectare of jalapeno pepper cultivar as 20 52 tons for drip and 27 44 tons for drip mulching treatment about 34 increase was achieved with mulching positive effects of colored mulching materials on yield were reported in previous studies rajablariani et al 2012 reported significant effects of transparent blue black red and silver color mulching materials on tomato yield and had the highest yield from blue and black mulching materials black colored mulching materials absorb sunlight the most prevent weed development increase soil temperature then provide the best growth ambient zhanga et al 2017 bora and babu 2014 reported about 21 greater tomato yield for drip black mulching treatments than for plain drip without mulching gerçek et al 2017 compared black mulching water pillow treatments with drip without mulching despite 52 less water application water pillows had 18 greater yield than drip irrigation colored mulching materials may have different effects on different plants gordon et al 2010 in a previous study effects of black and blue water pillows drip mulching and drip treatments on eggplant yields were investigated and 29 more yield was reported for black and blue water pillows as compared to drip irrigation but differences between the yields of different colors were not found to be significant gerçek and demirkaya 2020 ashrafuzzaman et al 2011 reported pepper yield as 13 4 t ha 1 for non mulched treatment 21 33 t ha 1 for black mulching treatment and 19 15 t ha 1 for blue mulching treatment in present study effects of black and blue water pillows and mulching materials were not significantly different 3 2 irrigation and water productivity in the first year 439 mm irrigation water was applied in drip treatments and 318 mm was applied in the other treatments in the second year 452 mm was applied in drip treatment and 328 mm was applied in the other treatments the differences between drip treatment and water pillows and drip mulching treatments was 121 mm in the first year and 124 mm in the second year in both years about 38 less water was applied in water pillows and drip mulching treatments plant water consumption is the sum of transpiration from the plant surfaces and evaporation from the soil surface it was calculated as 421 mm for drip treatment and 301 mm for the other treatments in the first year and respectively as 439 and 305 mm in the second year the difference in plant water consumptions between drip and the other treatments was measured as 120 mm in the first year and 134 mm in the second year as the average of two years plant water consumption was 30 lower in water pillows and drip mulching treatments since mulching prevented evaporations from the soil surface such a significant difference was encountered superior yields of water pillows and drip mulching treatments to drip irrigation treatments indicated that there were not any water deficiencies in these treatments thusly pre irrigation soil moisture levels varied between 20 and 22 in these treatments and between 18 and 20 in drip irrigation treatments kader et al 2017 indicated that mulching largely prevented evaporation from the soil thus reduced capillary rise from the lower layers and preserved soil moisture within the root zone for longer durations li et al 2013 reported that plastic mulching materials reduced total plant water consumption of maize by about 35 present findings well comply with the results of earlier studies despite less water use about 35 increase was achieved in yield of both cultivars irrigation durations vary based on the applied irrigation water quantities in drip irrigation treatments average irrigation duration in 2018 and 2019 was respectively identified as 68 and 64 min and total duration was respectively identified as 1972 and 2048 min in drip mulching treatments average irrigation duration was 57 min in the first year and 54 min in the second year total irrigation duration was 855 min in the first year and 864 min in the second year the amount of energy used in drip mulching treatments was 43 lower than the amount used in drip irrigation such an advantage was totally attributed to mulching material quite a short irrigation duration is the leading advantage of water pillows in water pillows the only thing an irrigator should do is to fill the water pillows irrigation duration was considered as the duration in which water was discharged from the drippers in drip irrigation and as the duration in which water pillows were filled with water in water pillows depending on water flow rate into the pillows therefore irrigation duration is quite low in water pillows in water pillow treatments average irrigation and total seasonal duration were about 3 and 42 min in both years the amount of energy used in water pillows was about 2 of the energy used in drip irrigation such a value was 5 of the energy used in drip mulching treatments there is a vast saving in energy with water pillows since there is no contact between the water and the soil while filling water pillows there is no problem of water erosion or surface runoff this water then leaks through the holes provided on plastic pipes such a leakage may take 24 h in some cases the issue to be pointed out here in is the much more energy use in drip and drip mulching treatments and almost zero energy use in water pillows since water is discharged gravimetrically in water pillows as it was in surface irrigation therefore there is no need for extra energy mulching is an option in drip irrigation and requires extra cost in water pillows plastic pipes serve both an irrigation tool and mulching material therefore mulching is an inherent characteristic of water pillow irrigation method thus does not constitute any extra costs such a case makes water pillows method more economic than drip method optimum use of energy is a significant issue in all sectors to decelerate global warming and to mitigate potential effects of climate change either solar or wind like renewable energy sources should be used or efficiency of fossil fuels should be improved daniel et al 2004 while there is a need for pump thus energy to supply a constant pressure and flow in drip irrigation there is no need for additional energy in water pillows gerçek et al 2009a 2009b gerçek et al 2017 irrigation water productivity iwp and water productivity wp values varied with the years and cultivars table 4 in the first year for captain capia pepper the highest and the lowest iwp values were obtained from drip blue mulching and drip treatments respectively for yellow stone chili pepper the highest and lowest iwp values were obtained from blue water pillow and drip treatments respectively the lowest wp value in captain capia and yellow stone chili pepper cultivar was obtained from drip treatments and the highest respectively from drip blue mulching and blue water pillow treatments in the second year in both pepper cultivars the lowest iwp and wp values were obtained from drip treatments the highest iwp value was obtained from black water pillow treatment in captain capia pepper cultivar and from drip black mulching treatment in yellow stone chili pepper cultivar the highest wp value was obtained from black water pillow treatment in captain capia pepper and from drip black mulching treatment in yellow stone chili pepper while there were significant differences in iwp and wp values of drip treatments and the other treatments the differences in iwp and wp values of water pillow and drip mulching treatments were not found to be significant p 0 05 present findings clearly revealed that mulching materials preserved soil moisture and improved yield levels therefore as compared to drip without mulching mulching materials yielded quite greater iwp and wp values in a previous study conducted to investigate the effects of water pillows and furrow irrigation on soybean water productivity value was calculated as 2 70 kg ha 1 mm 1 for water pillows and 1 63 kg ha 1 mm 1 for furrow irrigation gerçek et al 2009a in another study on peppers water productivity value of furrow and water pillows were respectively calculated as 18 2 and 33 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 mulching effect of water pillows increased water productivity by 60 as compared to furrow irrigation gercek et al 2009b water productivity of non mulched drip and furrow irrigation in pepper plants were respectively reported as 17 7 and 10 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 antony and singandhupe 2004 liang et al 2011 conducted a study with pepper plants under greenhouse conditions and reported water productivity value as 261 kg ha 1 mm 1 for drip mulching and 132 kg ha 1 mm 1 for drip treatments all these findings revealed that drip mulching increased water productivity values by about 50 65 present findings agree with those earlier ones similar cases are also valid for irrigation water productivity 3 3 soil temperatures soil temperatures at 10 cm depth for all treatments are provided in table 5 the lowest average soil temperature was measured in drip treatment and the highest values were measured in black water pillows and black mulching treatments in both years water pillow and drip mulching treatments had higher soil temperatures than drip treatment the average hottest temperatures were measured in july and august in both years in the first year the average temperature for these months was 30 2 c for drip irrigation while it was 31 1 31 4 c for water pillows and drip mulching treatments there was 1 2 c temperature difference between drip and black water pillow and drip black mulching and 0 9 c between drip and blue water pillow and drip blue mulching treatments similar findings were also observed in the other months and the second year in both years greater soil temperatures were measured in black water pillow and drip black mulching treatments than in blue water pillow and drip blue mulching treatments black colored water pillows absorbed more solar rays than blue colored water pillows therefore soil temperatures in black water pillow and drip black mulching treatments were greater than in blue water pillow treatments this difference had a positive effect on crop yields several researchers indicated that black mulching increased soil temperature and thus had positive effects on plant yields zhao et al 2012 emphasized that soil temperature was 2 9 c higher in black mulching treatments than in non mulched treatments potato yield was found to be 1820 kg ha 1 higher than non mulched treatments tesfaye et al 2016 compared the effects of black blue and clear mulches on tomato yield and soil temperatures with the control bare treatments and reported significant increases in soil temperature and yields with mulching treatments in present study soil temperatures both in water pillow and drip mulching treatments were higher than in drip treatments without mulching then such increasing temperatures might have increased yields 3 4 weeds since black and blue mulching materials of water pillows and drip mulching treatments did not pass sun light photosynthesis of weeds was prevented and thus weed development was not observed in these treatments fig 2 zhang et al 1992 reported that black plastic film mulch resulted in 100 control of all the weeds in maize that supported the present experimental result weeds were encountered only in drip irrigation treatments in present experimental greenhouse heliotropium europaeum l seteria glauca l beauv portulaca oleracea l amaranthus retroﬂexus l chenopodium album l agropyron repens l beauv poa annua l convolvulus arvensis l mercurialis annua l and tribulus terrestris l weed species were encountered these species are common species of the region encountered throughout the experimental season isık et al 2009 weed control was practiced manually with the use of simple mechanic tools and herbicides were not used it is possible to damage pepper roots during the weed control plants spend extra energy to repair damaged roots and such an effort may have negative effects on yield thusly in a previous study significant differences were reported in root distribution of mulched and non mulched irrigation treatments goyal et al 1988 weed control is a laborsome and a costly process weeds also take up soil water and nutrients to grow and compete with main crops for water and nutrients thus reduce yield levels ronchi et al 2007 reported that weed roots competed with coffee roots accordingly coffee roots stored more nutrients and such a case then negatively influenced coffee yields previous studies also reported prevention of weed growth with black and dark colored mulching materials covering the soil surface rajablariani et al 2012 tolasa and eshetu 2014 prevention of weed development was also reported in studies conducted with water pillows çömlekçioğlu et al 2008 gerçek et al 2009a 2009b gerçek et al 2017 altunlu et al 2017 gerçek and demirkaya 2020 4 conclusions optimum use of water resources is an essential component of sustainable agriculture pressurized irrigation methods and mulching materials should be used to improve water use efficiency drip irrigation systems have a high initial investment cost mulching also brings an extra cost to irrigation investments mulching is not an inherent component of drip irrigation it is totally up to the farmer energy is an essential component of drip irrigation for system operation water pillows as a new method of irrigation have various advantages over drip irrigation the yield values of drip mulching treatments were similar with the values of water pillows present findings revealed that water pillows and drip mulching treatments were clearly superior to drip irrigation although yield values of water pillows and drip mulching treatments were not significantly different no extra energy demand inherent mulching characteristics and quite low labor costs have made water pillows more advantages over drip mulching treatments on the other hand water pillows irrigation is quite cheaper and easier to apply than drip irrigation inhering mulching material nature of the water pillows undoubtedly makes the pillows a pioneering method of irrigation previous studies also put forth the advantages of water pillows over furrow and drip irrigation further research is recommended to investigate the effects of water pillows on salt distribution within soil profile and the effects of saline irrigation waters through water pillows on yield and soil properties declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
