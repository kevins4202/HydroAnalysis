24970,the size and relative growth rates of prawns vary in different culture environments we subject the highly productive and commercially valuable giant freshwater prawn macrobrachium rosenbergii to a prawn plant m rosenbergii hydrilla verticillata symbiotic culture environment in which water quality and habitat are adequate through introduction of an additional parameter to the gompertz function we develop an extended gompertz model egm which quantifies prawn growth data from the prawn plant symbiotic system we investigate the mathematical properties of this egm compute important properties use a nonlinear least squares method to estimate model parameters and discuss the existence and consistency of estimates the egm can capture the different forms of m rosenbergii relative growth rate and better quantifies growth accurately than alternative more conventional models keywords macrobrachium rosenbergii symbiotic relative growth rate extended gompertz model egm aquaculture 1 introduction consumers of cultured fish crustaceans and shellfish demand healthy and nutritional products with quality muscle texture and flavor accordingly farmers endeavor to provide products that meet these standards to maximize their economic return lie 2001 rasmussen 2001 many studies have reported problems with fish and shellfish culture in natural ponds such as products with poor muscle texture reduced taste and flavor and increased susceptibility to disease this reduced product quality translates to an economic loss for farmers stien et al 2005 wu et al 2017 improved product quality in addition to savings made on aquafeed and reduced environmental impacts can however be achieved when farmers take symbiotic relationships into consideration loneragan et al 2001 huong et al 2010 this process requires them to combine ecological and aquaculture technologies marcio and sidinei 2015 nair and salin 2012 ecology based culture systems such as prawn rice prawn vegetation crab plant and prawn lotus root intended to improve growth rates and muscle quality of prawns have been established throughout asia prawns grown in these cultures can have superior growth immunity and muscle quality and flavor to those cultured in natural ponds ecological cultures can also improve water quality reduce toxins and harmful aquatic bacteria result in savings on aquafeed e g prawn excrement can be absorbed by plants which are in turn eaten by prawns and provide shelter for culture species marcio and sidinei 2015 nair and salin 2012 huong et al 2010 cara et al 2011 loneragan et al 2001 thanigaivel et al 2016 although it has recognized that aquatic plants promote m rosenbergii growth thanigaivel et al 2016 cara et al 2011 growth models for this symbiotic system have not been developed relative growth rate rgr decreases as a function of size which is an important consideration when predicting growth curves nadav and nicole 2009 higgins et al 2015 in ecology rgr is a proxy of size barton 2002 which some common standard growth models such as logistic gompertz richards von bertalanffy multiscale dynamic and auto regressive and mixed models can predict nadav and nicole 2009 verhulst 1838 gompertz 1825 von bertalanffy 1960 richards 1959 tsoularis and wallace 2002 de souza et al 2012 bhowmick and bhattacharya 2014 de pinho et al 2014 bhowmick et al 2014 however in different culture environments the growth of a single species can vary and have different sizes and rgrs bhowmick and bhattacharya 2014 wu et al 2017 predicting growth curves in symbiotic systems is complicated as a given response might reflect a combination of physiological processes at molecular and biochemical levels and involve populations and communities grbic et al 2013 longqin et al 2017 the response of an individual is easily affected by external condition alteration kitano 2005 when prawns are cultured in a symbiotic system physiological responses can manifest themselves as changes in growth and rgr el khaldi 2010 to maintain harvest schedules accurate prediction of growth rates of cultured species requires knowledge of their biology and parental brood stock hernandez llamas and ratkowsky 2004 de valdar 2006 tjrve and tjrve 2010 huizan et al 2018 growth models in prawn plant symbiotic systems do not exist existing models simulating prawn growth focus on rgr in pond cultures de pinho et al 2014 wu et al 2017 therefore we subject the highly productive and commercially valuable giant river prawn m rosenbergii to improved water quality prawn plant hydrilla verticillata symbiotic culture environments we calibrate and validate our new growth curve model for m rosenbergii based on data from this symbiotic system and discuss this model s mathematical properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 prawns and experimental design juvenile m rosenbergii 2 48 0 14 cm length tip of eyestalk to tip of telson were provided by the national well bred aquatic product farm nanning guangxi china water plant h verticillata seeds were purchased from jiangsu aquatic plant development co ltd suzhou jiangsu china experiments were carried out at the national key aquaculture base nanning guangxi china in four replicate ponds 20 10 2 5 m labeled a d in which a prawn plant symbiotic system had been established following procedures outlined by huong et al 2010 plant area accounted for 30 of the total pond area juvenile prawns 240 individuals were placed into each of three replicate hoop nets 12 7 mm mesh in each pond prawns were randomly sampled at same sampling time in all ponds prawns were fed commercial food pellets shinta nanning guangxi china twice daily with an equal quantity placed into each hoop net water quality parameters were recorded biweekly using a multi parameter water analyzer fushui shanghai china length of 20 randomly sampled prawns within each hoop net was measured once a week over a 12 week period 2 2 model formulation universal rgr converts to a new function comprising a simple time allometric function tσ 1 representing growth and a decreasing function of size representing natural fitness in the prawn plant symbiotic system thus the proposed growth curve model for m rosenbergii in our symbiotic system is represented by a 1 x t d x t d t g x t t σ 1 in this model g xt is the size in the symbiotic system xt is the size at time t and σ is a constant that regulates the nature of responses to external condition when σ 1 there is no effect when σ 1 the effect is incremental positive when σ 1 the effect is detrimental negative thus the revised rgr is a combined simultaneous function of size and time which can be used to describe size in this symbiotic system we use gompertz s law as it is more suitable for fitting an asymmetrical s shaped growth curve to fish and prawn growth data gompertz 1825 standard choices of g xt without the adjusted constant lnk lnxt lead to the gompertz law here k is size at maturity as they are proportional g xt can be replaced with lnk lnxt reducing eq a to b 1 x t d x t d t ρ σ ln k ln x t t σ 1 here ρ is the decay parameter and ρ and σ must be greater than zero integrating eq b we obtain the following relation of size and time c ln x t x 0 ln k x 0 1 e ρ t σ where x0 is the size at t 0 by using c in b our modified rgr equation can be represented by d 1 x t d x t d t ϕ e ρ t σ t σ 1 here φ is the rate parameter eqs b and d both represent the same growth model but have a different functional form eq d is explicitly a function of time whereas b is a function of size and time in some special conditions these models are exponential if σ 1 and ρ 0 or gompertz if σ 1 so we introduce an additional term in the gompertz growth equation motivated by the fact that when prawns adapt to environmental change initially they go through a period of adjustment this biological explanation leads to the following growth model e 1 x t d x t d t ϕ e ρ t t σ here parameters φ and ρ common to the existing gompertz law we introduce the additional parameter σ to represent the adaptive ability of a prawn to a prawn plant symbiotic system we refer to d as the extended gompertz model egm to investigate the properties of this egm we summarize mathematical expressions of rgr and size for logistic richards von bertalanffy and gompertz growth models table 2 2 3 model properties properties of the egm logistic richards von bertalanffy and gompertz models are provided in table 3 before describing the mathematical properties of egm we must study their rgr profiles for various parameters monotonic and non monotonic shapes of rgr for the proposed egm are depicted in fig 1 while plots for time versus size are depicted in fig 2 other vital properties of the egm follow 2 3 1 maximum rgr the rgr of the egm in d is controlled by r t ϕ e ρ t σ t σ 1 here σ being a vital parameter rgr is a decreasing function φe ρt of t when σ 1 and has a maximum value at t 0 as σ 1 rgr becomes a combined product of two decreasing functions t 1 and ϕ e ρ t σ so the maximum value of rgr corresponds to t 0 rgr becomes undefined at t 0 as σ tends to 0 when σ attenuates from 1 the maximum value of rgr increases from φ and becomes unbounded at t 0 for σ 1 we get d r t d t ϕ t σ 2 e ρ t σ σ 1 ρ σ t σ the value of rgr is maximized when t max σ 1 ρ σ 1 σ with its maximum value determined by r t max ϕ e σ 1 σ σ 1 ρ σ σ 1 σ 2 3 2 point of inflection pi of rgr for most growth curves due to decreasing functions maximum values of rgr are observed at t 0 however in some extended models including our egm rgr increases over time from t 0 followed by attenuation after it reaches a maximum value so one point in time exists where rgr reaches a maximum which can be used to divide the growth period into two stages that where rgr first grows at an increasing rate and that where it decreases we refer to this as the pi thus we need to solve the equation d 2 r t d t 2 0 to attain the pi of rgr which leads to the equation d 2 r t d t 2 ϕ e ρ t σ t σ 3 ρ 2 σ 2 t 2 σ 3 ρ σ σ 1 t σ σ 1 σ 2 the pi of rt 3 σ 1 5 σ 1 σ 1 2 ρ σ 1 c both the pi are positive when σ 2 one pi is positive and the other negative as 1 σ 2 no pi is found when σ 1 2 3 3 size covariate form of rgr to study the size covariate form of rgr the rgr of the egm is represented by a function of body size first we take the logarithm on both sides of ln x t x 0 ln k x 0 1 e ρ t σ to get two important values from eq c namely t σ 1 ρ ln ln k ln x t ln k ln x 0 e ρ t σ ln k ln x t ln k ln x 0 then we substitute these values into the corresponding values of eq d to achieve rgr as a function of size with 1 x t d x t d t ϕ ln k ln x t ln k ln x 0 1 ρ ln ln k ln x t ln k ln x 0 σ 1 σ 2 3 4 time to reach a specific proportion of asymptotic size in growth curves with an upper horizontal asymptote it is important to estimate the time at which the growth process almost reaches the asymptotic size mischan et al 2011 de souza et al 2012 as mathematically it takes an unlimited amount of time for an organism to reach asymptotic size we focus on a point at which an organism nears asymptotic size for example that at which size approaches 99 asymptotic size biman et al 2017 in this study the size at time t with respect to asymptotic size can be obtained from the model egm with the proportion of size represented by γ where γ xt k so from table 2 we get γ e ϕ ρ σ e ρ t σ then we use logarithm twice on both sides to obtain the expression ln ρ σ ϕ ln 1 γ ρ t σ after simplification the expression is obtained as t 1 ρ ln ρ σ ϕ ln 1 γ 1 σ this point cannot be derived analytically for the egm model even for integral values of σ except for the case when σ 0 other elementary properties of the egm model include 1 the function xt represents an increasing function of time and 2 the pi is at the point in time when growth rate is greatest we can solve d 2 x t d t 2 0 to get the pi and develop the equation d 2 x t d t 2 x t ϕ e ρ t σ t σ 2 t r t σ 1 ρ σ t σ however this equation has no analytic solution so it must be solved numerically finally 3 the asymptotic size k is ruled by k x 0 e ϕ ρ σ 2 4 model validation and calibration 2 4 1 model validation to study the efficacy of our egm we analyze our prawn growth data parameters of the egm can be evaluated using nonlinear least squares a better growth model with excellent performance can be built using rgr time relationship as opposed to a size time relationship chakraborty and basu 2013 for validation the regression framework must be controlled by 1 x t d x t d t r t f t x t θ δ t where δt is represents an independent and normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and variance ŝ2 ƒ t xt θ is controlled by different growth laws which determine the trend of our egm whether an explicit function of rgr time or rgr time the rgr rt at time t1 r t 1 can be approximated by ln x t 2 ln x t 1 t 2 t 1 as it is not directly obtained from observation of the growth process in this function r t1 x t 1 and x t 2 are prawn lengths at times t1 and t2 respectively this empirical method to evaluate rgr has been used by sandland and mcgilchrist 1979 chakraborty et al 2013 and bhowmick and bhattacharya 2014 who determined xt at corresponding time points so t 1 2 q however we measured rgr rt at specific time points so t 1 2 q 1 the error sum of squares can be minimized when model parameters are evaluated using nonlinear least squares optimum properties such as existence and consistency and the convergent rate of the iterated algorithm decide the performance of the nonlinear evaluation chakraborty et al 2013 biman et al 2017 we studied the existence and consistency of the least squares for egm using the method of biman et al 2017 the derivations for other empirical growth models can be similarly performed 2 4 2 model calibration evaluated egm parameters are calculated using the nonlinear regression nls routine in r r core team 2015 for a small number of observations the decision made by both measures criteria is the same so we also used the akaike information criterion aic to identify the best fitting model akaike 1974 the aic value for our model is 2 lnl 2n with l being the maximum value of the likelihood function and k the number of model parameters akaike 1974 the model best fits when the value of aic is smallest root mean square error rmse is used to evaluate model fitness criteria 3 results and discussion 3 1 data prawn length and water quality parameters for weeks 1 12 are presented in table 1 mean sd in current study no significantly difference in concentration of do was observed in ponds a d we observed the do 5 mg l 1 in all ponds the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite in four ponds were unchanged along the experimental period and also no significantly difference in concentration was found in all ponds the average length of prawns in pond b at the beginning of the experiment 2 37 cm was shorter than lengths in other ponds table 1 thus under no significantly different external conditions prawn size at maturity after 12 weeks was also significantly lower in this than in other ponds parameters of m rosenbergii egm growth in a prawn plant symbiotic system were determined using the estimation procedure and prawn growth data from sampling ponds a d table 4 observed and fitted values for this proposed model are plotted in fig 3 the rgr in ponds a d first increased then decreased with maximum values experienced at intermediate times fig 3 for the model egm the effect when parameter σ 1 indicated that it was incremental for size in all ponds possibly because of reduced nitrite and nitrate and over time with an increase in do from h verticillata photosynthetic activity biman et al 2017 in all ponds σ 1 fig 1 indicating prawn size was incremental with high water quality and that the egm model was suitable for summarizing m rosenbergii growth according to aic and rmse values the curve fitted to the egm in each pond was better than those of logistic gompertz richards and von bertalanffy models table 4 the almost normally distributed rgr values were observed in each pond which may lead to more variation in aic and rmse values given rgr stability in each pond egm provides greater information into prawn growth egm rgr profiles in each pond had similar bell shaped curves the similarity in rgr profiles motivated us to compare aspects of growth curves directly related with time to maturity and final cohort size de pinho et al 2014 wu et al 2017 biman et al 2017 we performed a statistical equality test biman et al 2017 of expected times to reach maximum rgr and pis the maximum rgr in ponds a b c and d occurred on the fourth t ˆ 4 531 se 0 4004 third t ˆ 3 807 se 0 2186 fourth t ˆ 4 021 se 0 3681 and fourth t ˆ 3 947 se 0 3041 weeks respectively no significant difference existed between these time points and the estimated parameter σ 1 in any pond indicating two pis existed in each pond the first and second pis in ponds a b c and d were 1 997 6 844 1 223 6 115 1 487 6 392 and 1 361 6 581 respectively 4 conclusion we describe an extended growth model emg for the giant river prawn m rosenbergii in a prawn plant symbiotic system our model performed better than other standard models in fitting prawn growth data our model egm enables improved estimation and quantification of m rosenbergii growth in size over other models probably because it includes the additional function tσ 1 with a real constant σ introduced into existing mathematical forms of gompertz law this method and new prawn growth model could assist fisheries scientists in their development of more powerful models for other commercially valuable species declaration of competing

2017 in all ponds σ 1 fig 1 indicating prawn size was incremental with high water quality and that the egm model was suitable for summarizing m rosenbergii growth according to aic and rmse values the curve fitted to the egm in each pond was better than those of logistic gompertz richards and von bertalanffy models table 4 the almost normally distributed rgr values were observed in each pond which may lead to more variation in aic and rmse values given rgr stability in each pond egm provides greater information into prawn growth egm rgr profiles in each pond had similar bell shaped curves the

24971,when a matrix population model is nonautonomous i e when it represents a set of single time step annual ppms l t t 0 1 t 1 each corresponding to a fixed life cycle graph then each of the annual matrices generates its own set of model results to characterize the population in particular λ 1 t the asymptotic growth rate varies with t and may result in alternating predictions of population viability a logical way to characterize the population over the total period of observations is to average the given set of t ppms and i have proved the correct mode of averaging to be the pattern geometric average it means finding a matrix g such that its tth power equals the product of t annual matrices in the chronological order while its pattern does correspond to the given life cycle graph in practical cases however the mathematical problem of pattern geometric average has no exact solution for a fundamental mathematical reason nevertheless the approximate solutions have revealed a fair precision of approximation in recent case studies of alpine short lived perennials eritrichium caucasicum and androsace albana resulting in quite certain predictions of population viability by means of λ 1 g the dominant eigenvalue of the average matrix an alternative approach to estimate the viability leades to the concept of stochastic environment represented by the given ppms to be chosen at random and the ensuing stochastic growth rate λ s in the case studies the λ ss have been estimated by a direct method of monte carlo simulations all the e caucasicum estimates having unambiguously been less than λ 1 g whereas those for a albana being certainly greater than λ 1 g there should be a general mathematical reason for this too thus a challenge to the theory of nonnegative matrices abbreviations ppm population projection matrix lcg life cycle graph keywords discrete structured population life cycle graph matrix calibration pattern geometric average dominant eigenvalue reproductive uncertainty stochastic growth rate monte carlo simulation 1 introduction theoretical foundations of matrix population models came from the classical perron frobenius theorem for nonnegative matrices horn and johnson 1990 which introduced the concept of the dominant eigenvalue λ 1 l and established the existence and uniqueness of λ 1 l 0 in the spectrum of any nontrivial irreducible nonnegative matrix l since being launched into the literature as essentially linear systems with λ 1s serving as the asymptotic when t tends to infinity growth rates leslie 1945 1948 lefkovitch 1965 matrix population models have been motivating nontrivial mathematical problems to be posed and often solved surveys in cohen 1976 hansen 1986 cushing 1998 and logofet and belova 2008 see also cushing and yicang 1994 li and schneider 2002 logofet 2002 including those motivated by the need to calibrate reliably matrix l logofet 2008 2013a c d 2016 2017 logofet et al 2018 protasov and logofet 2014 which is nowadays called the population projection matrix ppm caswell 2001 in real populations however the asymptotic growth can hardly be observed therefore apparently dooming λ 1 to forever remain a pure theoretical abstraction nevertheless given a matrix l its λ 1 is uniquely determined by the matrix elements vital rates i e eventually by the population data that have been served to calibrate l moreover λ 1 l is mathematically known to increase decrease together with any element of an irreducible matrix l it is therefore quite logical that λ 1 l is considered to be the measure of how the local population is adapted to the environment where and when the data have been mined to calibrate the ppm when a matrix population model deals with the identified individuals type of data where the individuals are marked and followed over time caswell 2001 p 134 the ppm can already be calibrated from the data of only two consecutive time moments namely for the beginning t and the end t 1 of a single time step ibidem in accordance with the basic model equation 1 x t 1 l t x t t 0 1 where x t and x t 1 represent the observed vectors of population structure when data for several time steps are available we get several calibrated ppms l 0 l 1 l t each obeying eq 1 with a variety of values for each vital rate i e for each nonzero element of the matrix logofet et al 2017b table 3 different values of matrix elements result in respectively different characteristics even conflicting ones of the population such as the asymptotic growth rate the dominant eigenvalue λ 1 the steady state structure the corresponding eigenvector x and so on ibidem the estimates of age specific traits from stage specific models caswell 2001 p 116 become different too logofet et al 2017b table 4 if however the task is to get the population characteristics ensuing from the total observation period then we face the need to average all the given ppms and deduce the characteristics from the average matrix but unlike positive numbers how to average matrices is a far not trivial issue and this issue has not been given much attention in the ecological literature school education prompts using the arithmetic average in practice klimas et al 2012 logofet 2013b while theoretical constructions just assuming the average matrix to be known tuljapurkar 1986 1990 caswell 2001 averaging arithmetically poses no problems due to the linearity of matrices as operators in a vector space but the arithmetic mean has no meaning beside of the arithmetic one meanwhile averaging the ppms should have certain population meaning which is explained below if t t is the final moment of the observation period than the observed population structure x t is projected from the initial one x 0 by t consecutive projections obeying eq 1 2 x t l t 1 l t 2 l 1 l 0 x 0 it is logical that the average matrix g does the same by t projections i e 3 g t l t 1 l t 2 l 1 l 0 eq 3 bears the very idea of how to average the ppms and this idea leads evidently to the notion of geometric mean as was noted by logofet et al 2017a 2017b at first glance to find g from eq 3 is just a matter of routine calculating the t th power matrix root of the matrix product on the right hand side but matrix theory can only guarantee the root to exist in the space of complex matrices rather than in the set of nonnegative matrices while the complex values of vital rates make no sense see further discussion in logofet et al 2018 moreover the average matrix g is supposed to have the same pattern of zero nonzero allocation as those to be averaged the pattern being fixed by the known life cycle graph lcg of the organisms under study the above arguments have led me to the concept of pattern geometric average for nonnegative matrices logofet et al 2017a b logofet et al 2018 in this paper i present an efficient method to solve the pattern geometric average problem computationally the method applies in particular case studies of two alpine short lived perennials eritrichium caucasicum and androsace albana among rare red book spp the objects of population studies by my former and hopefully future botanic coauthors on the permanent sample plots in a high mountain reserve located in the north western caucasus logofet et al 2016a 2017c the data mined in the e caucasicum case study are of a quite specific identified individuals type namely identified individuals with uncertain parents logofet 2010 p 33 logofet et al 2012 p 98 the uncertain parents cause reproductive uncertainty ibidem the inability to calibrate stage specific reproduction rates in a unique way which complicates estimating the measure of how the local population is adapted to its environment as just the dominant eigenvalue of the calibrated ppm a number of tricks were proposed in the literature to cope with reproductive uncertainty recent survey in logofet 2017 all of them suggest additional assumptions to be made or hypotheses be accepted without any additional assumptions hypotheses matrix calibration results only in a certain finite range for the unknown reproduction rates hence in a certain range λ 1min λ 1 m a x for the adaptation measure λ 1 l rather than a single number when the range lies entirely to the left or to the right of λ 1 1 it does give a certain answer about whether the population declines or increases but it does not when λ 1 1 falls inside the range both cases did occur in modelling practice logofet et al 2016b table 4 logofet et al 2017b table 3 leaving the issue open to further general studies up to date however eight annual ppms have been calibrated and their pattern geometric average found luckily to have the range of λ 1 located entirely to the left of 1 logofet et al 2018 table 4 the identified individuals data mined in the a albana case study do not bear any reproductive uncertainty thus providing for the ppm calibration in a unique way logofet et al 2017c up to date seven annual ppms have been calibrated and their pattern geometric average found ibidem in the present article i report on the 8th calibrated ppm and how it modifies the average two outcomes from pattern geometric averaging in particular case studies give rise to comparing this original mode of population viability estimation with the well known concepts of population dynamics in variable environments tuljapurkar 1990 and stochastic growth rate λ s ibidem caswell 2001 in the variety of theoretical approximations to λ s ibidem sanz 2019 there is none to cope with reproductive uncertainty and moreover the annual ppms for e caucasicum and a albana have appeared to vary so markedly with time that the validity of theoretical assumptions is dubious for them i have therefore used direct monte carlo simulations to estimate 1 1 estimation means finding the attainable upper and lower bounds in case of reproductive uncertainty λ s of the e caucasicum population logofet et al 2018 table 5 and i report here on the outcome of the same method applied to the eight ppms of the a albana population now after getting the outputs from two methods of viability estimation we compare them for the local population of two alpine species and see the opposite relations whereas in case of reproductive uncertainty the λ 1 lower bound of the average ppm for e caucasicum is certainly greater than the upper one for its λ s the λ 1 of the average a albana matrix is markedly less than the corresponding λ s i discuss possible reasons for this controversy and formulate potential directions to study relevant issues in the theory of nonnegative matrices 2 objects and methods 2 1 eritrichium caucasicum case study eritrichium caucasicum is a herbaceous short lived perennial plant inhabiting alpine lichen heaths endemic to the caucasus mountains a local population of e caucasicum has been monitored annually on the permanent sample plots laid down in the teberda state biosphere reserve north eastern caucasus at the altitude of 2800 m asl in the year of 2009 logofet et al 2017b fig 1 presents the so called scale of ontogenesis for this species the sequence of discrete well defined stages a traditional tool in the russian school of geobotany seeds germinate each spring to seedlings and then mature successively to juvenile virginal and generative stages where they produce seeds severe wintering conditions cause some of generative plants to not flower in the upcoming season and this phenomenon causes the backward transition va g to appear in the lcg fig 2 corresponding to the one year time step botanists can distinguish between the plants at the generative stage and those at the terminal generative stage after which the plants die out thus two generative stages provide for the population recruitment at the initial stage but no method is available to distinguish between the progenies from those two stages reproductive uncertainty is therefore inevitable in this case even for the identified individuals type of data which were mined by means of annual censuses from permanent sample plots in the period of 2009 to 2017 logofet et al 2018 note that eliminating the reproductive uncertainty by means of aggregating two reproductive stages of the life cycle into a single one may distort the true figures up to the opposite forecast of population viability logofet 2017 with the population vector denoted as x t j t v t g t gt t t and in accordance with the lcg fig 2 the ppm takes on the following form 4 l t f 0 0 0 0 c d e 0 0 f h 0 0 k l 0 0 0 a b 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 with two uncertain reproduction rates a and b constrained by the recruitment balance equation 5 j t 1 a g t b gt t t 0 1 7 where j t 1 g t and gt t are all known from the data table 1 in logofet et al 2018 known also are all the transitions made by the identified individuals for one time step table 2 in logofet et al 2018 so that the ppms l t can be calibrated in rational numbers with the observed frequencies of transitions table 1 extremely low values of λ 1 in the annual matrices l 6 and l 7 indicate extremely severe conditions for survival during the years of 2015 2017 the corresponding life cycles have even lost some vital transitions resulting in zero values of certain vital rates f l in l 6 and e h l in l 7 this in turn deprives the lcg of being strongly connected harary et al 1965 hence the ppm of being irreducible horn and johnson 1990 or equivalently indecomposable gantmacher 1959 2 2 a directed graph is strongly connected if any pair of its nodes is connected by a directed path along its arcs removing an arc may disturb this property and result in the decomposition of the associated matrix it means that regular routines to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors may fail in finding the dominant one logofet 2013b and we need a closer look at the strongly connected components into which the graph has disintegrated and to check which of the corresponding matrix blocks bears the dominant eigenvalue it should preferably be a diagonal block that contains reproduction rates if such a block does exist it does not for example in matrix l 6 when a 0 or b 0 and the matrix decomposes just into its diagonal elements so that λ 1 becomes the maximal of them zero components in the dominant eigenvectors do not contradict the perron frobenius theorem in this case as the theorem applies only to irreducible matrices see caswell 2001 4 5 1 4 5 4 7 5 2 for greater detail among the 8 calibrated ppms there are 2 having the range of λ 1 located entirely to the right of λ 1 1 5 to the left of 1 and one matrix l 3 having 1 inside of the range intuition prompts that both the average matrix and the stochastic growth rate should indicate population decline in this case 2 2 averaging under reproductive uncertainty in general the averaging matrix equations like eq 3 have no exact solutions as overdetermined systems of scalar equations for instance eq 3 takes on the following form 6 g 8 l 7 l 6 l 5 l 4 l 3 l 2 l 1 l 0 0 for e caucasicum with matrices l j being determined in table 1 while corresponding to the lcg the average matrix g has only 9 unknown elements see eq 4 whereas the system of element wise scalar equations for them the one equivalent to the matrix eq 6 consists of 16 equations which can therefore not be consistent so we have to resort to an approximate solution the one that minimizes the difference between the chronological product of 8 ppms and the 8th power of the average matrix the task to find the pattern geometric average of the given matrices reduces therefore to a constrained minimization problem for a norm of the left hand side of eq 6 the constraints being determined by matrix g being a ppm of the fixed pattern 4 and within the bounds of the ppms to be averaged greater detail and routine descriptions can be found in logofet et al 2018 reproductive uncertainty complicates the task as we have to deal with the whole one parametric families 3 3 two parameters a and b are bound by the linear eq 5 whereby the second can be expressed via the first or vice versa instead of single annual matrices with certain ranges of their dominant eigenvalues table 1 hence the average matrix has to also represent a respective family with a certain range of its λ 1s to avoid a variety of mathematical settings for the pattern geometric average problem in this case i have proposed a heuristic approach using the t f decomposition as in eq 4 logofet et al 2018 we first solve the constraint maximization problem for the transition parts t j with a high approximation accuracy guaranteed by their substochastic property then we add the average of f j s found by means of interval computations e g neumaier 1990 this tf method has been applied to solve the pattern geometric average problem for 7 ppms of e caucasicum logofet et al 2018 table 2 with the range λ 1min gtf λ 1 max gtf lying luckily on the right of λ 1 1 logofet et al 2018 and i report here the result of adding the 8th recently calibrated ppm to the former set of annual ppms to be averaged 2 3 stochastic growth rate as an index of population viability in the theory of population growth in random environments tuljapurkar 1990 caswell 2001 the set of calibrated annual ppms is considered to reflect the spectrum of potential variations in the environment each particular matrix being responsible for the whole complex of environmental conditions that determined the corresponding set of vital rates matrix elements stochastic variations in time are therefore reduced to random choice from the given set of ppms in a long theoretically infinite sequence of transformations l j that act on the population vector such a sequence was long ago proved to converge furstenberg and kesten 1960 oseledec 1968 cohen 1979a 1979b to the limit that defined what is now called the stochastic growth rate λ s 7 log λ s lim τ 1 τ log n τ lim 1 τ log l τ 1 l 0 x 0 1 here n τ denotes the total population size and 1 the norm as the sum of vector components in modulus evidently the value of λ s relative to 1 indicates exponential growth or decline in the total population size thus serving as an index of population viability theoretically the limit of a converging sequence can be accurately approximated by any distant enough member and this is the method i apply to estimate λ s in a number of monte carlo tests the random choice is i i d independent identically distributed at each step τ while the reproductive uncertainty forced me to choose uncertain reproduction rates a and b at random too therefore i implement two series of tests the first one at the uniform probability distribution over the l j specific range of a hence b being uniquely determined after a has been chosen the second series at the normal distribution truncated on the same finite range repetitions of each series reveal the minimal and maximal estimates of λ s for each version of simulated reproductive uncertainty 2 4 androsace albana case study androsace albana is also a herbaceous short lived perennial plant inhabiting alpine lichen heaths and other habitats logofet et al 2017c it is listed in the red book of the krasnodar territory 2007 and the red book of the adygea republic 2012 as a rare species its scale of ontogenesis is shown in fig 3 and the lcg in fig 4 bearing the same features as the lcg of e caucasicum in particular delays in the im and v stages explainable by the fact that the harsh conditions of high mountains force plants to resort to the space holder strategy körner 2003 meaning to stay or grow in one place for as long as possible accelerated transitions pl im as a manifestation of polyvariant ontogeny in a albana under conditions of the alpine zone in the north western caucasus however the species is monocarpic unlike e caucasicum which excludes any chance of reproductive uncertainty the identified individuals data have been mined from permanent sample plots each august in the 2009 2017 period logofet et al 2019 the individuals exhibit different rates of ontogeny so that population recruitments are found in either of the stage specific groups pl j or im at the moment of census in accordance with the lcg fig 4 the ppm takes on the following form 8 l 0 0 0 0 a d 0 0 0 b e f h 0 c 0 0 k l 0 0 0 0 m 0 a b l m 0 again eight ppms l t have been calibrated in rational numbers with the observed frequencies of transitions table 2 now 3 calibrated ppms have their λ 1s located to the right of λ 1 1 and 5 to the left of 1 while the favourable unfavourable years seem to synchronise for both species see table 1 the same intuition prompts again that both the average matrix and the stochastic growth rate should indicate population decline 3 results 3 1 averaging the annual e caucasicum ppms table 3 presents the outcome of solving the pattern geometric average problem by the tf method explained in section 2 2 the range λ 1min gtf λ 1 max gtf is still after adding the 8th annual ppm to those 7 averaged before table 2 in logofet et al 2018 on the left of λ 1 1 the steady state population structures dominant eigenvectors are apparently within the bounds determined by the annual ppms 3 2 e caucasicum growth in random environments random environments are represented by the 8 annual ppms calibrated from the identified individuals with uncertain parents data table 1 chosen at random i i d the matrices form fairly long sequences to estimate limit 7 being random different realisations of the finite sequence give different yet close to the limit estimates of λ s the greater the number of realisations the wider should be the range of the estimates table 4 represents the results illustrating this point as was expected all the estimated ranges of variations in the estimates locate to the left of 1 indicating population decline it is natural that different realizations of the random sequence n τ give different estimates of λ s and their range narrows when the length of the finite sequence increases table 4 conversely the increase in the number of realizations within 100 while preserving the length somehow widens the range of variations table 4 the ranges obtained in series 2 with normal distributions over the ranges of uncertainty in the reproduction rates are consistently narrower than those in series 1 with uniform distributions comparing these ranges with that of the pattern geometric average table 3 we see the latter overestimating all the ranges of λ s thus obtained 3 3 averaging the annual a albana ppms table 5 presents the outcome of solving the pattern geometric average problem by minimizing directly the norm of the left hand side in eq 6 for the 8 ppms presented in table 2 the minimal value of the norm is considered as the approximation error and it has turned out fairly small equal to 2 941 10 3 again the arithmetic mean of annual ppms gives markedly greater value of λ 1 with a markedly differing dominant eigenvector 3 4 a albana growth in random environments random environments are presented by the 8 annual ppms calibrated from the identified individuals data table 2 the same technique as before yet without random choice of the reproduction rates results in the estimates of λ s shown in table 6 again all the estimates locate to the left of 1 indicating population decline it is natural that different realizations of the random sequence n τ give different estimates of λ s and the range narrows from 6 to 1 thousandth parts with increasing the sequence length illustrating a fundamental lemma of real analysis table 6 conversely the increase in the number of realizations within 100 while preserving the length somehow widens the range of variations illustrating just common sense table 6 however the a albana stochastic growth rate turns out markedly greater that λ 1 g table 5 the dominant eigenvalue of the pattern geometric average of the same annual ppms in contrast to the opposite relation in e caucasicum this observation is what the common sense cannot explain 4 discussion and conclusion two species populations of herbaceous plants are monitored annually in the same alpine habitat and it is not surprising that their ppms calibrated from the data of almost the same type react on temporal variations of environment conditions in a concerted manner the years when the e caucasicum ppms have at least the maximum of their λ 1s greater less than 1 are the same as those for a albana cf tables 1 and 2 as the most of ppms have their λ 1s essentially less that 1 it is also not surprising that both the λ 1 of their pattern geometric averages and the stochastic growth rates these indices of local population viability are markedly less than 1 cf tables 3 and 5 predicting the populations to decline surprising is the fact the species specific investigations of those indices reveal the opposite order relationships between them in the populations under concern cf tables 3 4 and 5 6 which deprives the pattern geometric averaging as a less resource consuming method of an ability to serve as an a priori estimate of the stochastic growth rate the first direction to seek out the reason for such an opposition concerns the methods that both indices are calculated by as regards the stochastic growth rate the method that i have applied ensues directly from the mathematical definition of λ s as the limit of the infinite sequence in the left hand side of eq 7 while there exist theoretical approximations of or bounds for the λ s see sanz 2019 and references therein the direct method reducing to the calculation of a distant enough member of the sequence should be regarded as the most reliable and consistent one its consistency is the same as the fundamentals of real analysis in mathematics the only point to be criticized is the random i i d choice of the current ppm which is of course a caricature of reality and should be modified to mimic the real course of good and bad years sanz 2019 but even two caricatures should look alike when drawn by the same technique as regards the pattern geometric average it is a novel concept well grounded at least in the population projection terms introduction section 2 2 and motivating the proper mathematics eqs 3 and 6 thinking just mathematically one might and some reviewers did perceive the task as solving the mere equation 9 g l 7 l 6 l 5 l 4 l 3 l 2 l 1 l 0 1 8 which is formally equivalent to eq 6 and represents the idea of geometric mean for the 8 given matrices however the matrices are generally not commutative in the product 4 4 it means that a permutation of cofactor matrices does change the product unlike real numbers and it is the chronological order only right to left in the multiplication that makes sense in the population projection context eq 2 even theoretically to certify that a proper matrix root does exist in the variety of formal solutions to eq 9 is a hard problem and matrix theory has not yet achieved a great progress in the problem of geometric mean certain progress has only been achieved for those positive definite matrices that commute in the product ando et al 2004 and a few results found for those that do not bhatia and holbrook 2006 by no means can the ppm be positive definite already because of its not being symmetric the problem to find the matrix root of a given natural power has been permanently attracting certain attention in the literature on matrix theory jain et al 1979 denman 1981 reams 1997 higham and lin 2009 mcdonald et al 2014 politi and popolizio 2015 tam and huang 2016 treated mostly as a particular case of finding the matrix function of a given matrix via its jordan canonical form horn and johnson 1990 ch 9 higham 2008 ch 7 in particular it was noted that many questions about nonnegative matrices with a positive eigenvector could be reduced to the questions about stochastic matrices horn and johnson 1990 8 7 p1 linking to applications with discrete time markov chain models however in computation practice even if you succeeded in getting the arithmetic value of the t th power root from the diagonal jordan canonical form of the ppm product and thus obtain the real valued or even positive valued matrix root there would be nothing to guarantee the result having the same matrix pattern as the ppms to be averaged moreover such a matrix does generally not exist as is noted in section 2 2 with regard to eq 6 in these circumstances the approximate solution to eq 6 as a matrix whose pattern does correspond to the given lcg while the elements being within the bounds predetermined by the annual ppms to be averaged represents a reasonable decision the constraint minimization problem that has implemented the decision finds fairly low values of the approximation error tables 3 and 5 much lower than those that might explain the change in relationships between the viability indices under concern by the inaccuracy of approximate solutions thus the methods themselves can hardly be the source of controversy and we have to seek out along another direction from the methods to objects i e the local populations of two species there are obvious distinctions in the species biology a albana being monocarpic but e caucasicum being polycarpic with two reproductive stages in the life cycle fig 2 and the lack of known traits to distinguish the recruitment from the parents at different stages logofet et al 2017b ensuing reproductive uncertainty in the field data modifies slightly the experiment design in monte carlo simulations but can hardly cause any principal distinctions in the outcome of the direct method to estimate the λ s hence the reason of controversy should be sought in averaging the annual ppms among the effects caused by reproductive uncertainty unfortunately matrix theory cannot at the moment propose any theoretical results that might elucidate how given a set of annual ppms the pattern of the lcg would effect the λ 1 of g their pattern geometric average matrix as a solution to the constraint minimization problem section 2 2 the mathematical problem itself is not trivial logofet 2008 which complicates theoretical research it is still not clear whether the solution ought to belong the boundary or the interior of b the set of constraints and this uncertainty diminishes reliability in the computational procedures that should find the global minimum of the approximation error on b in view of high demands the direct method of lambda estimation places on computing resources a dream result would be a theorem that could enable us given a particular lcg to judge whether the pattern geometric average would give the upper of the lower bound for the corresponding stochastic growth rate this is a great challenge to the theory of nonnegative matrices and an issue worthy of research efforts in a number of aspects discussed acknowledgements the study was supported by the russian foundation for basic research grants 16 04 00832 19 04 01227 roberto salguro gomez and two anonymous reviewers made certain corrections and suggestions that have improved the quality of the original manuscript 
24971,when a matrix population model is nonautonomous i e when it represents a set of single time step annual ppms l t t 0 1 t 1 each corresponding to a fixed life cycle graph then each of the annual matrices generates its own set of model results to characterize the population in particular λ 1 t the asymptotic growth rate varies with t and may result in alternating predictions of population viability a logical way to characterize the population over the total period of observations is to average the given set of t ppms and i have proved the correct mode of averaging to be the pattern geometric average it means finding a matrix g such that its tth power equals the product of t annual matrices in the chronological order while its pattern does correspond to the given life cycle graph in practical cases however the mathematical problem of pattern geometric average has no exact solution for a fundamental mathematical reason nevertheless the approximate solutions have revealed a fair precision of approximation in recent case studies of alpine short lived perennials eritrichium caucasicum and androsace albana resulting in quite certain predictions of population viability by means of λ 1 g the dominant eigenvalue of the average matrix an alternative approach to estimate the viability leades to the concept of stochastic environment represented by the given ppms to be chosen at random and the ensuing stochastic growth rate λ s in the case studies the λ ss have been estimated by a direct method of monte carlo simulations all the e caucasicum estimates having unambiguously been less than λ 1 g whereas those for a albana being certainly greater than λ 1 g there should be a general mathematical reason for this too thus a challenge to the theory of nonnegative matrices

irreducible nonnegative matrix l since being launched into the literature as essentially linear systems with λ 1s serving as the asymptotic when t tends to infinity growth rates leslie 1945 1948 lefkovitch 1965 matrix population models have been motivating nontrivial mathematical problems to be posed and often solved surveys in cohen 1976 hansen 1986 cushing 1998 and logofet and belova 2008 see also cushing and yicang 1994 li and schneider 2002 logofet 2002 including those motivated by the need to calibrate reliably matrix l logofet 2008 2013a c d 2016 2017 logofet et al 2018 protasov and logofet 2014 which is nowadays called the population projection matrix ppm caswell 2001 in real populations however the asymptotic growth can hardly be observed therefore apparently dooming λ 1 to forever remain a pure theoretical abstraction nevertheless given a matrix l its λ 1 is uniquely determined by the matrix elements vital rates i e eventually by the population data that have been served to calibrate l moreover λ 1 l is mathematically known to increase decrease together with any element of an irreducible matrix l it is therefore quite logical that λ 1 l is considered to be the measure of how the local population is adapted to the environment where and when the data have been mined to calibrate the ppm when a matrix population model deals with the identified individuals type of data where the individuals are marked and followed over time caswell 2001 p 134 the ppm can already be calibrated from the data of only two consecutive time moments namely for the beginning t and the end t 1 of a single time step ibidem in accordance with the basic model equation 1 x t 1 l t x t t 0 1 where x t and x t 1 represent the observed vectors of population structure when data for several time steps are available we get several calibrated ppms l 0 l 1 l t each obeying eq 1 with a variety of values for each vital rate i e for each nonzero element of the matrix logofet et al 2017b table 3 different values of matrix elements result in respectively different characteristics even conflicting ones of the population such as the asymptotic growth rate the dominant eigenvalue λ 1 the steady state structure the corresponding eigenvector x and so on ibidem the estimates of age specific traits from stage specific models caswell 2001 p 116 become different too logofet et al 2017b table 4 if however the task is to get the population characteristics ensuing from the total observation period then we face the need to average all the given ppms and deduce the characteristics from the average matrix but unlike positive numbers how to average matrices is a far not trivial issue and this issue has not been given much attention in the ecological literature school education prompts using the arithmetic average in practice klimas et al 2012 logofet 2013b while theoretical constructions just assuming the average matrix to be known tuljapurkar 1986 1990 caswell 2001 averaging arithmetically poses no problems due to the linearity of matrices as operators in a vector space but the arithmetic mean has no meaning beside of the arithmetic one meanwhile averaging the ppms should have certain population meaning which is explained below if t t is the final moment of the observation period than the observed population structure x t is projected from the initial one x 0 by t consecutive projections obeying eq 1 2 x t l t 1 l t 2 l 1 l 0 x 0 it is logical that the average matrix g does the same by t projections i e 3 g t l t 1 l t 2 l 1 l 0 eq 3 bears the very idea of how to average the ppms and this idea leads evidently to the notion of geometric mean as was noted by logofet et al 2017a 2017b at first glance to find g from eq 3 is just a matter of routine calculating the t th power matrix root of the matrix product on the right hand side but matrix theory can only guarantee the root to exist in the space of complex matrices rather than in the set of nonnegative matrices while the complex values of vital rates make no sense see further discussion in logofet et al 2018 moreover the average matrix g is supposed to have the same pattern of zero nonzero allocation as those to be averaged the pattern being fixed by the known life cycle graph lcg of the organisms under study the above arguments have led me to the concept of pattern geometric average for nonnegative matrices logofet et al 2017a b logofet et al 2018 in this paper i present an efficient method to solve the pattern geometric average problem computationally the method applies in particular case studies of two alpine short lived perennials eritrichium caucasicum and androsace albana among rare red book spp the objects of population studies by my former and hopefully future botanic coauthors on the permanent sample plots in a high mountain reserve located in the north western caucasus logofet et al 2016a 2017c the data mined in the e caucasicum case study are of a quite specific identified individuals type namely identified individuals with uncertain parents logofet 2010 p 33 logofet et al 2012 p 98 the uncertain parents cause reproductive uncertainty ibidem the inability to calibrate stage specific reproduction rates in a unique way which complicates estimating the measure of how the local population is adapted to its environment as just the dominant eigenvalue of the calibrated ppm a number of tricks were proposed in the literature to cope with reproductive uncertainty recent survey in logofet 2017 all of them suggest additional assumptions to be made or hypotheses be accepted without any additional assumptions hypotheses matrix calibration results only in a certain finite range for the unknown reproduction rates hence in a certain range λ 1min λ 1 m a x for the adaptation measure λ 1 l rather than a single number when the range lies entirely to the left or to the right of λ 1 1 it does give a certain answer about whether the population declines or increases but it does not when λ 1 1 falls inside the range both cases did occur in modelling practice logofet et al 2016b table 4 logofet et al 2017b table 3 leaving the issue open to further general studies up to date however eight annual ppms have been calibrated and their pattern geometric average found luckily to have the range of λ 1 located entirely to the left of 1 logofet et al 2018 table 4 the identified individuals data mined in the a albana case study do not bear any reproductive uncertainty thus providing for the ppm calibration in a unique way logofet et al 2017c up to date seven annual ppms have been calibrated and their pattern geometric average found ibidem in the present article i report on the 8th calibrated ppm and how it modifies the average two outcomes from pattern geometric averaging in particular case studies give rise to comparing this original mode of population viability estimation with the well known concepts of population dynamics in variable environments tuljapurkar 1990 and stochastic growth rate λ s ibidem caswell 2001 in the variety of theoretical approximations to λ s ibidem sanz 2019 there is none to cope with reproductive uncertainty and moreover the annual ppms for e caucasicum and a albana have appeared to vary so markedly with time that the validity of theoretical assumptions is dubious for them i have therefore used direct monte carlo simulations to estimate 1 1 estimation means finding the attainable upper and lower bounds in case of reproductive uncertainty λ s of the e caucasicum population logofet et al 2018 table 5 and i report here on the outcome of the same method applied to the eight ppms of the a albana population now after getting the outputs from two methods of viability estimation we compare them for the local population of two alpine species and see the opposite relations whereas in case of reproductive uncertainty the λ 1 lower bound of the average ppm for e caucasicum is certainly greater than the upper one for its λ s the λ 1 of the average a albana matrix is markedly less than the corresponding λ s i discuss possible reasons for this controversy and formulate potential directions to study relevant issues in the theory of nonnegative matrices 2 objects and methods 2 1 eritrichium caucasicum case study eritrichium caucasicum is a herbaceous short lived perennial plant inhabiting alpine lichen heaths endemic to the caucasus mountains a local population of e caucasicum has been monitored annually on the permanent sample plots laid down in the teberda state biosphere reserve north eastern caucasus at the altitude of 2800 m asl in the year of 2009 logofet et al 2017b fig 1 presents the so called scale of ontogenesis for this species the sequence of discrete well defined stages a traditional tool in the russian school of geobotany seeds germinate each spring to seedlings and then mature successively to juvenile virginal and generative stages where they produce seeds severe wintering conditions cause some of generative plants to not flower in the upcoming season and this phenomenon causes the backward transition va g to appear in the lcg fig 2 corresponding to the one year time step botanists can distinguish between the plants at the generative stage and those at the terminal generative stage after which the plants die out thus two generative stages provide for the population recruitment at the initial stage but no method is available to distinguish between the progenies from those two stages reproductive uncertainty is therefore inevitable in this case even for the identified individuals type of data which were mined by means of annual censuses from permanent sample plots in the period of 2009 to 2017 logofet et al 2018 note that eliminating the reproductive uncertainty by means of aggregating two reproductive stages of the life cycle into a single one may distort the true figures up to the opposite forecast of population viability logofet 2017 with the population vector denoted as x t j t v t g t gt t t and in accordance with the lcg fig 2 the ppm takes on the following form 4 l t f 0 0 0 0 c d e 0 0 f h 0 0 k l 0 0 0 a b 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 with two uncertain reproduction rates a and b constrained by the recruitment balance equation 5 j t 1 a g t b gt t t 0 1 7 where j t 1 g t and gt t are all known from the data table 1 in logofet et al 2018 known also are all the transitions made by the identified individuals for one time step table 2 in logofet et al 2018 so that the ppms l t can be calibrated in rational numbers with the observed frequencies of transitions table 1 extremely low values of λ 1 in the annual matrices l 6 and l 7 indicate extremely severe conditions for survival during the years of 2015 2017 the corresponding life cycles have even lost some vital transitions resulting in zero values of certain vital rates f l in l 6 and e h l in l 7 this in turn deprives the lcg of being strongly connected harary et al 1965 hence the ppm of being irreducible horn and johnson 1990 or equivalently indecomposable gantmacher 1959 2 2 a directed graph is strongly connected if any pair of its nodes is connected by a directed path along its arcs removing an arc may disturb this property and result in the decomposition of the associated matrix it means that regular routines to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors may fail in finding the dominant one logofet 2013b and we need a closer look at the strongly connected components into which the graph has disintegrated and to check which of the corresponding matrix blocks bears the dominant eigenvalue it should preferably be a diagonal block that contains reproduction rates if such a block does exist it does not for example in matrix l 6 when a 0 or b 0 and the matrix decomposes just into its diagonal elements so that λ 1 becomes the maximal of them zero components in the dominant eigenvectors do not contradict the perron frobenius theorem in this case as the theorem applies only to irreducible matrices see caswell 2001 4 5 1 4 5 4 7 5 2 for greater detail among the 8 calibrated ppms there are 2 having the range of λ 1 located entirely to the right of λ 1 1 5 to the left of 1 and one matrix l 3 having 1 inside of the range intuition prompts that both the average matrix and the stochastic growth rate should indicate population decline in this case 2 2 averaging under reproductive uncertainty in general the averaging matrix equations like eq 3 have no exact solutions as overdetermined systems of scalar equations for instance eq 3 takes on the following form 6 g 8 l 7 l 6 l 5 l 4 l 3 l 2 l 1 l 0 0 for e caucasicum with matrices l j being determined in table 1 while corresponding to the lcg the average matrix g has only 9 unknown elements see eq 4 whereas the system of element wise scalar equations for them the one equivalent to the matrix eq 6 consists of 16 equations which can therefore not be consistent so we have to resort to an approximate solution the one that minimizes the difference between the chronological product of 8 ppms and the 8th power of the average matrix the task to find the pattern geometric average of the given matrices reduces therefore to a constrained minimization problem for a norm of the left hand side of eq 6 the constraints being determined by matrix g being a ppm of the fixed pattern 4 and within the bounds of the ppms to be averaged greater detail and routine descriptions can be found in logofet et al 2018 reproductive uncertainty complicates the task as we have to deal with the whole one parametric families 3 3 two parameters a and b are bound by the linear eq 5 whereby the second can be expressed via the first or vice versa instead of single annual matrices with certain ranges of their dominant eigenvalues table 1 hence the average matrix has to also represent a respective family with a certain range of its λ 1s to avoid a variety of mathematical settings for the pattern geometric average problem in this case i have proposed a heuristic approach using the t f decomposition as in eq 4 logofet et al 2018 we first solve the constraint maximization problem for the transition parts t j with a high approximation accuracy guaranteed by their substochastic property then we add the average of f j s found by means of interval computations e g neumaier 1990 this tf method has been applied to solve the pattern geometric average problem for 7 ppms of e caucasicum logofet et al 2018 table 2 with the range λ 1min gtf λ 1 max gtf lying luckily on the right of λ 1 1 logofet et al 2018 and i report here the result of adding the 8th recently calibrated ppm to the former set of annual ppms to be averaged 2 3 stochastic growth rate as an index of population viability in the theory of population growth in random environments tuljapurkar 1990 caswell 2001 the set of calibrated annual ppms is considered to reflect the spectrum of potential variations in the environment each particular matrix being responsible for the whole complex of environmental conditions that determined the corresponding set of vital rates matrix elements stochastic variations in time are therefore reduced to random choice from the given set of ppms in a long theoretically infinite sequence of transformations l j that act on the population vector such a sequence was long ago proved to converge furstenberg and kesten 1960 oseledec 1968 cohen 1979a 1979b to the limit that defined what is now called the stochastic growth rate λ s 7 log λ s lim τ 1 τ log n τ lim 1 τ log l τ 1 l 0 x 0 1 here n τ denotes the total population size and 1 the norm as the sum of vector components in modulus evidently the value of λ s relative to 1 indicates exponential growth or decline in the total population size thus serving as an index of population viability theoretically the limit of a converging sequence can be accurately approximated by any distant enough member and this is the method i apply to estimate λ s in a number of monte carlo tests the random choice is i i d independent identically distributed at each step τ while the reproductive uncertainty forced me to choose uncertain reproduction rates a and b at random too therefore i implement two series of tests the first one at the uniform probability distribution over the l j specific range of a hence b being uniquely determined after a has been chosen the second series at the normal distribution truncated on the same finite range repetitions of each series reveal the minimal and maximal estimates of λ s for each version of simulated reproductive uncertainty 2 4 androsace albana case study androsace albana is also a herbaceous short lived perennial plant inhabiting alpine lichen heaths and other habitats logofet et al 2017c it is listed in the red book of the krasnodar territory 2007 and the red book of the adygea republic 2012 as a rare species its scale of ontogenesis is shown in fig 3 and the lcg in fig 4 bearing the same features as the lcg of e caucasicum in particular delays in the im and v stages explainable by the fact that the harsh conditions of high mountains force plants to resort to the space holder strategy körner 2003 meaning to stay or grow in one place for as long as possible accelerated transitions pl im as a manifestation of polyvariant ontogeny in a albana under conditions of the alpine zone in the north western caucasus however the species is monocarpic unlike e caucasicum which excludes any chance of reproductive uncertainty the identified individuals data have been mined from permanent sample plots each august in the 2009 2017 period logofet et al 2019 the individuals exhibit different rates of ontogeny so that population recruitments are found in either of the stage specific groups pl j or im at the moment of census in accordance with the lcg fig 4 the ppm takes on the following form 8 l 0 0 0 0 a d 0 0 0 b e f h 0 c 0 0 k l 0 0 0 0 m 0 a b l m 0 again eight ppms l t have been calibrated in rational numbers with the observed frequencies of transitions table 2 now 3 calibrated ppms have their λ 1s located to the right of λ 1 1 and 5 to the left of 1 while the favourable unfavourable years seem to synchronise for both species see table 1 the same intuition prompts again that both the average matrix and the stochastic growth rate should indicate population decline 3 results 3 1 averaging the annual e caucasicum ppms table 3 presents the outcome of solving the pattern geometric average problem by the tf method explained in section 2 2 the range λ 1min gtf λ 1 max gtf is still after adding the 8th annual ppm to those 7 averaged before table 2 in logofet et al 2018 on the left of λ 1 1 the steady state population structures dominant eigenvectors are apparently within the bounds determined by the annual ppms 3 2 e caucasicum growth in random environments random environments are represented by the 8 annual ppms calibrated from the identified individuals with uncertain parents data table 1 chosen at random i i d the matrices form fairly long sequences to estimate limit 7 being random different realisations of the finite sequence give different yet close to the limit estimates of λ s the greater the number of realisations the wider should be the range of the estimates table 4 represents the results illustrating this point as was expected all the estimated ranges of variations in the estimates locate to the left of 1 indicating population decline it is natural that different realizations of the random sequence n τ give different estimates of λ s and their range narrows when the length of the finite sequence increases table 4 conversely the increase in the number of realizations within 100 while preserving the length somehow widens the range of variations table 4 the ranges obtained in series 2 with normal distributions over the ranges of uncertainty in the reproduction rates are consistently narrower than those in series 1 with uniform distributions comparing these ranges with that of the pattern geometric average table 3 we see the latter overestimating all the ranges of λ s thus obtained 3 3 averaging the annual a albana ppms table 5 presents the outcome of solving the pattern geometric average problem by minimizing directly the norm of the left hand side in eq 6 for the 8 ppms presented in table 2 the minimal value of the norm is considered as the approximation error and it has turned out fairly small equal to 2 941 10 3 again the arithmetic mean of annual ppms gives markedly greater value of λ 1 with a markedly differing dominant eigenvector 3 4 a albana growth in random environments random environments are presented by the 8 annual ppms calibrated from the identified individuals data table 2 the same technique as before yet without random choice of the reproduction rates results in the estimates of λ s shown in table 6 again all the estimates locate to the left of 1 indicating population decline it is natural that different realizations of the random sequence n τ give different estimates of λ s and the range narrows from 6 to 1 thousandth parts with increasing the sequence length illustrating a fundamental lemma of real analysis table 6 conversely the increase in the number of realizations within 100 while preserving the length somehow widens the range of variations illustrating just common sense table 6 however the a albana stochastic growth rate turns out markedly greater that λ 1 g table 5 the dominant eigenvalue of the pattern geometric average of the same annual ppms in contrast to the opposite relation in e caucasicum this observation is what the common sense cannot explain 4 discussion and conclusion two species populations of herbaceous plants are monitored annually in the same alpine habitat and it is not surprising that their ppms calibrated from the data of almost the same type react on temporal variations of environment conditions in a concerted manner the years when the e caucasicum ppms have at least the maximum of their λ 1s greater less than 1 are the same as those for a albana cf tables 1 and 2 as the most of ppms have their λ 1s essentially less that 1 it is also not surprising that both the λ 1 of their pattern geometric averages and the stochastic growth rates these indices of local population viability are markedly less than 1 cf tables 3 and 5 predicting the populations to decline surprising is the fact the species specific investigations of those indices reveal the opposite order relationships between them in the populations under concern cf tables 3 4 and 5 6 which deprives the pattern geometric averaging as a less resource consuming method of an ability to serve as an a priori estimate of the stochastic growth rate the first direction to seek out the reason for such an opposition concerns the methods that both indices are calculated by as regards the stochastic growth rate the method that i have applied ensues directly from the mathematical definition of λ s as the limit of the infinite sequence in the left hand side of eq 7 while there exist theoretical approximations of or bounds for the λ s see sanz 2019 and references therein the direct method reducing to the calculation of a distant enough member of the sequence should be regarded as the most reliable and consistent one its consistency is the same as the fundamentals of real analysis in mathematics the only point to be criticized is the random i i d choice of the current ppm which is of course a caricature of reality and should be modified to mimic the real course of good and bad years sanz 2019 but even two caricatures should look alike when drawn by the same technique as regards the pattern geometric average it is a novel concept well grounded at least in the population projection terms introduction section 2 2 and motivating the proper mathematics eqs 3 and 6 thinking just mathematically one might and some reviewers did perceive the task as solving the mere equation 9 g l 7 l 6 l 5 l 4 l 3 l 2 l 1 l 0 1 8 which is formally equivalent to eq 6 and represents the idea of geometric mean for the 8 given matrices however the matrices are generally not commutative in the product 4 4 it means that a permutation of cofactor matrices does change the product unlike real numbers and it is the chronological order only right to left in the multiplication that makes sense in the population projection context eq 2 even theoretically to certify that a proper matrix root does exist in the variety of formal solutions to eq 9 is a hard problem and matrix theory has not yet achieved a great progress in the problem of geometric mean certain progress has only been achieved for those positive definite matrices that commute in the product ando et al 2004 and a few results found for those that do not bhatia and holbrook 2006 by no means can the ppm be positive definite already because of its not being symmetric the problem to find the matrix root of a given natural power has been permanently attracting certain attention in the literature on matrix theory jain et al 1979 denman 1981 reams 1997 higham and lin 2009 mcdonald et al 2014 politi and popolizio 2015 tam and huang 2016 treated mostly as a particular case of finding the matrix function of a given matrix via its jordan canonical form horn and johnson 1990 ch 9 higham 2008 ch 7 in particular it was noted that many questions about nonnegative matrices with a positive eigenvector could be reduced to the questions about stochastic matrices horn and johnson 1990 8 7 p1 linking to applications with discrete time markov chain models however in computation practice even if you succeeded in getting the arithmetic value of the t th power root from the diagonal jordan canonical form of the ppm product and thus obtain the real valued or even positive valued matrix root there would be nothing to guarantee the result having the same matrix pattern as the ppms to be averaged moreover such a matrix does generally not exist as is noted in section 2 2 with regard to eq 6 in these circumstances the approximate solution to eq 6 as a matrix whose pattern does correspond to the given lcg while the elements being within the bounds predetermined by the annual ppms to be averaged represents a reasonable decision the constraint minimization problem that has implemented the decision finds fairly low values of the approximation error tables 3 and 5 much lower than those that might explain the change in relationships between the viability indices under concern by the inaccuracy of approximate solutions thus the methods themselves can hardly be the source of controversy and we have to seek out along another direction from the methods to objects i e the local populations of two species there are obvious distinctions in the species biology a albana being monocarpic but e caucasicum being polycarpic with two reproductive stages in the life cycle fig 2 and the lack of known traits to distinguish the recruitment from the parents at different stages logofet et al 2017b ensuing reproductive uncertainty in the field data modifies slightly the experiment design in monte carlo simulations but can hardly cause any principal distinctions in the outcome of the direct method to estimate the λ s hence the reason of controversy should be sought in averaging the annual ppms among the effects caused by reproductive uncertainty unfortunately matrix theory cannot at the moment propose any theoretical results that might elucidate how given a set of annual ppms the pattern of the lcg would effect the λ 1 of g their pattern geometric average matrix as a solution to the constraint minimization problem section 2 2 the mathematical problem itself is not trivial logofet 2008 which complicates theoretical research it is still not clear whether the solution ought to belong the boundary or the interior of b the set of constraints and this uncertainty diminishes reliability in the computational procedures that should find the global minimum of the approximation error on b in view of high demands the direct method of lambda estimation places on computing resources a dream result would be a theorem that could enable us given a particular lcg to judge whether the pattern geometric average would give the upper of the lower bound for the corresponding stochastic growth rate this is a great challenge to the theory of nonnegative matrices and an issue worthy of research efforts in a number of aspects discussed acknowledgements the study was supported by the russian foundation for basic research grants 16 04 00832 19 04 01227 roberto salguro gomez and two

24972,understanding and predicting the ecological consequences of different management alternatives is becoming increasingly important to support environmental management decisions ecological models could contribute to such predictions but in the past this was often not the case ecological models are often developed within research projects but are rarely used for practical applications in this synthesis paper we discuss how to strengthen the role of ecological modeling in supporting environmental management decisions with a focus on methodological aspects we address mainly ecological modellers but also potential users of modeling results various modeling approaches can be used to predict the response of ecosystems to anthropogenic interventions including mechanistic models statistical models and machine learning approaches regardless of the chosen approach we outline how to better align the modeling to the decision making process and identify six requirements that we believe are important to increase the usefulness of ecological models for management support especially if management decisions need to be justified to the public these cover i a mechanistic understanding regarding causality ii alignment of model input and output with the management decision iii appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions iv uncertainty quantification v sufficient predictive performance and vi transparent communication we discuss challenges and synthesize suggestions for addressing these points keywords mechanistic models machine learning uncertainty calibration variable selection stakeholder theory based data science 1 introduction environmental management decisions should be based on the current state of scientific knowledge and at the same time account for multiple societal objectives that are of different importance for diverse stakeholders one important step in environmental decision support is the prediction of consequences of different management alternatives for the fulfillment of the societal objectives reichert et al 2015 ecological models can be used to support this step as far as ecological objectives are involved however so far this was often not the case i e valuable scientific knowledge is ignored addison et al 2013 in this paper we explore why this might be the case and how it could be changed in the future hence what components are particularly important and need more attention to make ecological modeling results useful for supporting environmental management two extreme views on ecological models exist either models are believed to be the solution and redemption of each and every problem without much questioning or they are perceived as tools that can be misused to provide any desired prediction and should therefore not be trusted at all both extremes may at least partly be attributed to missing knowledge on how model building works in general regarding the specific assumptions towards the model and its potential deficits with this paper we want to contribute to a more realistic judgement of the potential for ecological models to support environmental management we mainly address ecological modelers from various fields regarding modeling approaches and applications that want to increase the relevance of their model results for practice for potential users from practice this paper offers a summary regarding possible challenges and pitfalls of ecological models that should be considered when using model outputs for decision making there are numerous fields of environmental management where we see an increasing potential for ecological models to support environmental decision making examples are the spatial planning for endangered species conservation biodiversity protection habitat restoration and the assessment and management of ecosystem services alien species lakes and fisheries micropollutants including the registration of chemicals and risk assessment multiple stressors global environmental change and health risks e g from pathogenic microorganisms or antibiotic resistant bacteria examples for ecological models in these application fields are provided in the appendix table a1 however the involvement of ecological modeling in environmental decision making imposes several challenges first of all it requires collaboration between environmental decision makers and ecological modelers to develop a common understanding and enable knowledge transfer between science and practice in both directions e g jakeman et al 2006 voinov et al 2016 basco carrera et al 2017 parrott 2017 engineering consultants can play a role in this process as well additional challenges concern technical issues that are the focus of this paper depending on the availability of data and knowledge various modeling approaches can be used to answer management related questions section 2 1 here we discuss cross cutting issues that are important regardless of the specific modeling approach nevertheless depending on the choice of the model they can be more or less challenging to address the ideal model to support environmental management decisions can be directly linked to management objectives predicts effects of management alternatives without bias includes adequate precision and a correct estimate of prediction uncertainty is transferable in space and time and is easy to understand however real models are usually far from ideal we identified the following six requirements that we believe are important to achieve this as much as possible 1 there exists a basic mechanistic understanding of the system regarding causality which is considered in the model 2 the model input and output variables are aligned with the management question 3 the model has an appropriate spatial and temporal resolution to address the management question 4 the model uncertainty can be quantified 5 the model has a sufficient predictive performance to be useful for the management problem 6 the modeling procedure its assumptions and its deficits are transparently communicated in the following for each point we 1 discuss why we find it important 2 review how to address it in practice and 3 provide an outlook about how its implementation could be facilitated in the future the why sections address both model developers and environmental managers that may potentially benefit from ecological models while the how and future sections cover technical aspects that are of interest mainly for model developers furthermore we outline a way to integrate the ecological modeling process in the decision making process box 1 2 there exists a basic mechanistic understanding of the system regarding causality 2 1 why a model that is useful for environmental management needs to synthesize the most relevant aspects of our current knowledge regarding the system and how management actions impact relevant system components and processes the more knowledge exists about the system the better we can predict its response such knowledge can consist of mechanistic understanding and of empirical data while both are important for any ecological model various modeling approaches differ in their needs regarding the availability of each one fig 2 given a specific management question an appropriate modeling approach should be chosen accordingly robson 2014 baker et al 2018 recently the increasing availability of big data and computational power has allowed complex algorithmic machine learning artificial intelligence models to be developed seemingly overcoming issues of data and knowledge limitations such approaches do not rely on subjective prior knowledge and can search for patterns in available data without any prejudice however there is a danger of developing models based on easily available data as input variables also called predictor explanatory or independent variables that are somehow correlated with the model output variables i e response or dependent variables but without explicit consideration of cause effect mechanisms the use of biased input data can lead to biased results if input variables do not present mechanistically linked attributes of the system they may have limited practical value for environmental management or even produce false predictions based on spurious correlations in the data an additional danger when ignoring prior knowledge about important mechanisms is that the dynamic nature of the system is disregarded and important feedback loops between output variables are overlooked robson 2014 therefore we consider it important to build on existing mechanistic understanding of a system and invest in improving it regardless of which modeling approach is chosen a mechanistic or a data driven approach dormann et al 2012 this makes it less likely but not impossible that model results are biased and produce false predictions or correct predictions for the wrong reasons 2 2 how while the consideration of knowledge about cause effect mechanisms is an explicit step when developing mechanistic process based models we think it is also crucial for the development of any data driven statistical model this is especially true if it should inform management decisions first of all the explicit consideration of cause effect mechanisms facilitates the choice of an appropriate model structure or potential candidate model structures to be tested including an appropriate description of model errors for instance when building a multivariate statistical model we may have to decide if it should be a linear generalized linear or non linear model and may have to choose a link function and make distributional assumptions furthermore some mechanistic understanding can help with the pre selection of input variables actually the inclusion of input variables can be seen as a formulation of hypotheses and the selection procedure as a falsification process this process has major implications on the outcomes of the model and the conclusions for management one step in the direction of considering cause effect mechanisms is the distinction of direct and indirect influence factors for direct influence factors e g temperature we have a basic mechanistic understanding of how they influence the output variables e g reproduction of organisms even if we use empirical functional relationships to parameterize the model and infer the parameters from the data conversely indirect influence factors e g altitude are those that influence the direct ones and therefore only indirectly affect the output variables models that use direct influence factors as input variables have the potential to be more general transferable than models based on indirect influence factors guisan and zimmermann 2000 but data on direct influence factors is not always available validation of the model outcomes with independent data may help evaluating whether the model captures the most important influence factors and cause effect relationships or if a good model fit during calibration is just caused by overfitting or confounding variables to close data gaps in space and or time direct influence factors can be predicted through the formulation of models from indirect ones e g water temperature hill et al 2014 however this introduces additional uncertainty to the model see section 5 finding a solid mechanistic basis for any modeling approach benefits from a close collaboration between the experts in charge of gathering data e g field ecologists experimentalists who have practical knowledge about the system and the modelers that are able to express this knowledge in mathematical terms in addition more exchange between the different fields of ecological modeling could facilitate model comparisons across the range of statistical and mechanistic models such a comparison could reveal the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to address specific management questions and help improving both types of models for data rich situations a promising approach may be to use rather unconstrained data driven e g machine learning deep learning methods for a first exploratory analysis to detect patterns in the data however it should be noted that such purely data driven models may be poor for predicting outside the range of calibration therefore we suggest confronting this information with prior mechanistic knowledge about the system in a next step this could then lead to the development of models that consider mechanistic knowledge and can be used to test hypotheses regarding cause effect relationships e g peters et al 2014 feld et al 2016 purely data driven models can then serve as a benchmark regarding the predictive performance for models with a more constraint model structure for rather data poor situations it might be possible to transfer knowledge from other systems and test it with new data in a bayesian framework 2 3 future changes currently many machine learning models are good in predicting if applied within their calibrated range however their internal structure is often not accessible and therefore hard to understand therefore they are perceived as black boxes castelvecchi 2016 attempts in data science to open the black box of such purely data driven algorithmic models may help extracting mechanistic understanding from big data this may further develop to what we call theory based data science box 2 fig 2 where both mechanistic understanding and a flexible structure which is derived from data analysis can be combined using synergies between complementary modeling approaches will advance mechanistic understanding and predictive performance of ecological models baker et al 2018 robson 2014 in parallel the increasing development of large scale experimental facilities e g mesocosms will contribute to the validation of cause effect hypotheses while the use of mechanistic models may contribute to improve experimental design for example if a data driven model detects an effect of an input variable on the abundance of a certain species a mesocosm study could be set up to manipulate this input variable to verify if it has an effect in a second step a mechanistic model could be calibrated to the data of a first set of experiments e g the time series of the development of a population and the model can then be used to test e g the effect of an improved or reduced temporal resolution of the experimental data on the parameter estimates likewise the implementation of management measures e g upgrade of waste water treatment plans morphological restoration of rivers measures to improve the trophic state of lakes offers the opportunity to use these as large scale experiments and derive monitoring data with a strong experimental design e g before after control impact stewart oaten et al 1986 to strengthen cause effect linkages detect feedback loops and to validate and improve model predictions further long term ecological monitoring programs have started to coordinate their work at regional and global scales while emphasizing societally relevant information on the sustainable use of natural resources mirtl et al 2018 the resulting field data is highly relevant homogeneous and continuous in time facilitating the identification of causal relationships the coordination of these different data and knowledge sources requires anticipatory planning funding that covers a long time horizon and close collaboration of various experts 3 the model considers input and output variables that are relevant for management 3 1 why to be useful for environmental management model outputs have to be aligned with management objectives while model inputs have to reflect environmental factors that influence the model outputs and are influenced by the management alternatives that are of interest for the decision makers or stakeholders fig 1 with such a model we can analyze management scenarios by modifying the input variables subject to anthropogenic changes and learning about their potential effects on the management objectives for instance a model describing local species diversity will not be useful for supporting the management objective of stopping a certain target species decline in abundance because the output variable is not aligned to the management objective on the other hand a model predicting a target species abundance based only on latitude and temperature as input variables will not be useful either if the potential management alternatives affect water quality while seemingly trivial in practice it might be a major challenge to identify and incorporate relevant input and output variables or output variables with sufficient sensitivity to the input variables that are relevant for management 3 2 how the alignment of model input and output variables with the management questions requires a clear understanding of management objectives and an agreement about how to measure their fulfillment based on attributes of the system e g fish biodiversity measured as the number of different fish species occurring in the respective catchment furthermore it requires an identification of important drivers that can be linked to potential management alternatives to be considered e g longitudinal connectivity to be increased through the removal of barriers or water quality to be improved by upgrading wastewater treatment plants towards the removal of micropollutants this can be reached by a dialogue between modelers decision makers and stakeholders e g within a co design process multi criteria decision analysis and problem structuring methods can support this phase e g keeney 1982 1996 the next step is then to develop a conceptual model that describes the cause effect linkages between the drivers that are affected by the management alternatives and the ecological variables that can be linked to the management objectives see section 2 2 on direct and indirect influence factors depending on the management situation decision makers may be interested in learning about the relative importance of anthropogenic stressors to identify deficits and potential management alternatives to address them in other situations they might be interested in predicting the effects of already identified management alternatives in both cases models can be useful if they include important input variables that may influence the fulfillment of the management objective this is true even if some of the input variables are out of scope of local management e g socio economic or climate variables and even if they are difficult to project into the future e g land use or technological changes in such cases model based scenario analysis can be used to conditionally predict the potential effects of the respective management alternatives taking into account various assumptions about future changes in variables that cannot be controlled by the decision makers such an approach can help in the process of identifying cost effective management alternatives i e alternatives that reach defined management targets with the least costs moreover it allows us to identify management alternatives that are robust to future unmanageable changes however this might require to consider additional input variables which may increase model complexity ideally robust management alternatives aimed at mitigating local or regional impacts will be developed while considering larger scales or global changes the challenge consists in balancing model complexity considering many variables and their interactions to increase realism and model simplicity highlighting the most relevant factors to increase understandability and reduce development computation and maintenance costs e g fulton et al 2004 bunnefeld et al 2011 a framework for assessing model structure adequacy was recently proposed by getz et al 2018 in our view the interaction with the decision makers guisan et al 2013 and or experts in the field is vital to test the plausibility of the models through repeated iterations testing different management strategies which represent different input variables at different intensities implemented at different spatio temporal scales the performance and realism of ecological models and their outcomes can be improved such trial and error exercises are actually one of the advantages of ecological models as in silico hypothesis testing can save resources and time 3 3 future changes new data analysis approaches in addition to recent developments in remote and in situ sensing are already delivering a wide range of variables that describe anthropogenic impairments on ecosystems bush et al 2017 novel datasets incorporate a large variety of highly relevant input variables into environmental models including global annual land use land cover changes esa climate change initiative land cover regional climatic conditions at a daily temporal resolution haylock et al 2008 and global freshwater specific predictor variables domisch et al 2015 furthermore remote sensing techniques are capable of providing detailed information on local conditions such as water temperature patterns recorded by drones a large untapped potential remains to be explored and tested in this domain pettorelli et al 2014 see jones et al 2016 for an example such large datasets describing variables that govern ecosystems along the hierarchy of different nested scales are becoming widely available also to the general public due to open access policies and on line repositories increasing the spatio temporal resolution of input variables should help improving the robustness of the models and the accuracy of the output this in turn fosters the support of environmental management decisions however larger model extents and improved variable resolution may also increase the challenge of uncertainty quantification section 5 furthermore untangling the effect of large scale overriding factors and their interplay with local conditions may be challenging besides increasing the resolution of independent environmental variables it is necessary to additionally invest in improving the temporal spatial and taxonomic resolution of the response variables i e biological variables high throughput dna sequencing methods e g metabarcoding will provide new opportunities and challenges in this regard bush et al 2017 hering et al 2018 furthermore openly accessible data repositories wilkinson et al 2016 will contribute to the availability of biological data some of them cover the global scale and all taxa e g gbif www gbif org while others provide information of specific geographic regions and ecosystem types e g schmidt kloiber and hering 2015 4 the model has an appropriate spatial and temporal resolution for addressing the management problem 4 1 why for adequately addressing a management question ecological models need to account for the often administratively determined temporal and spatial scales relevant for the management situation however in addition the ecology and natural dynamics of the system need to be considered with the model s resolution reflecting a balance between the scale of the management problem and the level of ecological detail needed to produce meaningful time and space units rahbek 2005 elith and leathwick 2009 martínez lópez et al 2016 for example a nationwide biodiversity management strategy planned for the next 50 years might benefit from a species distribution model representing general and macro scale patterns and processes using coarse spatial grid units and decadal time steps while little value would be added by including diurnal migration patterns of species to this model a site specific management plan however might benefit from the explicit inclusion of diurnal migration patterns in order to identify specific habitat units in need of protection hence avoiding a mismatch in scale between model management plan and ecological processes is an important cornerstone for creating models representing ecological processes of management relevance increasingly models are used to make predictions towards new locations or into the future the models are then applied outside the domain in which they were developed requiring careful consideration of model uncertainties and associated predictive performance under these new conditions hence the decision about a suitable spatial extent and time horizon is crucial 4 2 how a first step towards identifying the appropriate scales is to map the processes dependencies drivers and pressures that are relevant for the management problem in a conceptual model linkage map prior to any data analyses such linkage mapping provides a comprehensive overview of dependencies this assists in increasing the mechanistic foundation of the model allowing for the selection of causally linked influence factors and the appropriate spatial and temporal resolution in which they operate moreover spatial dependencies and temporal lag effects can be identified where the source may be spatially and or temporally disconnected from the impact this is for instance the case in considering effects of micro plastics which can travel long distances often changing in toxicity due to fragmentation sorption of pollutants and fouling by potentially pathogenic communities along the way before accumulating at sink locations far away from original sources vermeiren et al 2016 after carefully filtering the most relevant processes in collaboration with experts in the field the potential input variables should become clear as well as the appropriate scale that should match the output variable to reduce uncertainties in the model a conceptual model can be developed with input from stakeholders experts and the literature this helps identifying the adequate breadth coverage of important aspects and depth level of detail of the model to answer the management question note that the focus might need to be widened to capture the full range of relevant processes for instance the spatial scale of a model and thus the spatial scale of the input data can be broader than the spatial area in which it will be applied in order to provide a better coverage of certain environmental variables this is of particular relevance when predictions to new environmental conditions e g increased temperature or reduced pollutant concentrations are made which are not included in the current area to be managed avoiding e g non analogue climates in future predictions in such cases visualization techniques can support the exploration of model behaviour and predictions to novel environments e g zurell et al 2012 however data might not always be available at the appropriate spatial and temporal resolution or within the range of the environmental variables in which the model will operate in such cases uncertainty assessment as discussed in section 5 becomes of paramount importance 4 3 future changes we are in an exciting era of increasing data availability e g stemming from wireless real time monitoring systems edna analyses remote sensing images over large spatial extents and at short time intervals and capacity to collect and store these data which can dramatically increase the spatial and temporal resolution of ecological data and thereby ecological models the flexibility and dynamic features of models may particularly benefit where time series of both input and output variables are available the appropriate curation and documentation and continuous work on incorporating these data into useful ecological models is crucial to benefit best from them the latter includes mapping linkages between management actions and ecosystem properties and ecosystem processes in conceptual models and formalizing and testing these links in temporally and spatially explicit quantitative models 5 model uncertainty can be quantified 5 1 why all models are prone to various sources of uncertainty in addition to inherent stochasticity of environmental systems uncertainty originates from model inputs explanatory variables model structure and model parameters knutti 2008 even observed data used for model calibration and validation are subject to uncertainty owing to imperfect sampling and measurement procedures to allow environmental managers to interpret model results correctly and draw robust conclusions it is essential to provide an estimate of model uncertainty along with the expected value of model outcomes fischhoff and davis 2014 buisson et al 2010 uusitalo et al 2015 only then well informed decisions can be made even if uncertainty bounds between management alternatives largely overlap it might be possible to take a clear decision if it is evident that some of the alternatives lead to changes in the desired direction reichert and borsuk 2005 uncertainty information helps decision makers to develop realistic expectations regarding the predicted effects of management alternatives wardekker et al 2008 and allows considering their own risk attitude keeney 1982 so called risk neutral decision makers prefer the alternative with the highest expected value independent from its uncertainty risk averse decision makers on the other hand prefer alternatives with a lower uncertainty even if their expected value is slightly lower compared to other alternatives with higher uncertainty additionally a description of uncertainty facilitates the learning process wardekker et al 2008 and adaptive management being transparent about the uncertainty of predictions finally increases credibility of scientists 5 2 how while information on model uncertainty is indispensable for decision making warmink et al 2010 uncertainty is often difficult to quantify most tangible is the quantification of input and parameter uncertainty first uncertainty estimates for all model input variables and parameters have to be collected this uncertainty can be described by probability distributions reichert et al 2015 in a second step input uncertainty has to be propagated through the model to the outputs for non linear models monte carlo simulation is the standard approach however it may be computationally demanding depending on the model runtime several methods exist to infer parameters and their uncertainty from data this is sometimes called inverse modeling if no prior knowledge about the model parameters and their uncertainty exists but there is enough data for model calibration parameters can be inferred using frequentist statistics neyman 1937 e g maximum likelihood estimation see standard textbooks however this is only possible if all parameters are identifiable from the data parameters may be unidentifiable due to a lack of sensitivity of the model to some of the parameters or due to correlations among parameters i e if several combinations of parameter values lead to the same model output based on certain assumptions it is possible to derive estimates of confidence intervals for parameters and model outputs e g using a profile likelihood approach montoya et al 2009 ideally the model is validated with independent data section 6 whenever prior knowledge about parameter values is available e g from previous model applications experiments or ecological theory e g robson et al 2018 and data for calibration exist bayesian inference can be applied it offers a consistent framework to combine both prior information and data to derive the best predictions possible based on the current state of knowledge gelman et al 2014 ellison 2004 it allows to consistently update the information when new data becomes available many software tools exist that facilitate bayesian inference see krapu and borsuk 2019 such as winbugs lunn et al 2000 jags plummer 2003 or stan carpenter et al 2017 and can be run on or linked to various platforms for statistical computing e g r r core team 2019 however a solid mathematical understanding of the underlying concepts is needed to choose an adequate setup of the inference algorithm and to identify and solve numerical problems e g regarding efficiency and convergence bayesian inference is even more computationally demanding than just forward propagation of uncertainty as it requires a larger number of model runs it may become infeasible if a single model run consumes much computation time e g several minutes and or when the posterior parameter distribution has a complex structure which increases the number of required model runs although structural inadequacy i e model structure error makes a large contribution to total uncertainty of environmental models refsgaard et al 2006 this aspect is still underrepresented in current practice in some fields of ecological modeling e g mechanistic ecosystem models while it is popular in others e g species distribution models araujo and new 2007 in recent years a number of studies employed multi model ensembles to also consider structural uncertainty in analyses of environmental management scenarios lenhart et al 2010 ramin et al 2012 trolle et al 2014 although the approach of multi model ensembles is promising it is not without limitations janssen et al 2015 a practical problem especially with mechanistic models is the considerable effort needed for setting up and running multiple models in parallel in other fields e g in species distribution modeling different challenges exist one of them is to check whether the calibration leads to reasonable results in all models in the ensemble and whether they are in accordance to our current mechanistic understanding e g if coefficients have the correct sign or response curves have an adequate shape a conceptual problem lies in the subjective choice of models and a possible underestimation of uncertainty if the chosen models are too similar a recent review confirms that model averaging is particularly useful if the covariance between models is low dormann et al 2018 as discussed in the previous sections scenario analyses can help exploring the robustness of model outcomes to future changes that are too hard to predict 5 3 future changes the current push for increasing computational resources and the development of more efficient algorithms such as approximate bayesian computation e g albert et al 2015 will facilitate solving inference problems that were computationally too expensive in the past the use of high performance computing methods that allow parallelization and the use of supercomputers will contribute to this development e g sukys and kattwinkel 2017 the development of emulators simplifications of the original simulation models that speed up simulation times for the costs of additional uncertainty are another line of current research that might facilitate the quantification of uncertainty for slow models e g carbajal et al 2017 the increasing availability of high resolution data makes the formulation of models even more challenging because basic statistical assumptions e g with regard to the independence of observations may no longer hold and more sophisticated formulations of error models may be required e g to consider autocorrelation furthermore with improved measurement techniques intrinsic environmental and or demographic stochasticity of the system may dominate over measurement error therefore the development of stochastic ecological models will gain importance examples are stochastic differential equations and individual based also called agent based models for population dynamics that consider demographic stochasticity applying bayesian inference to such stochastic models is a huge challenge and the development of efficient algorithms is becoming a research area of increasing importance kattwinkel and reichert 2017 joining mathematical and computational skills with the ecological knowledge about the system and an understanding of the management problems is a considerable challenge consequently there is a great need for inter and transdisciplinary collaboration to effectively progress towards useful and applicable ecological modeling e g voinov and bousquet 2010 basco carrera et al 2017 parrott 2017 martínez lópez et al 2019 in addition educating scientists from various fields in data science including bayesian statistics will facilitate knowledge transfer and collaboration among different disciplines 6 the model has sufficient predictive performance 6 1 why any model that aims at informing environmental management objectives should have a decent predictive performance as otherwise it is useless in addition two aspects are important model sensitivity to the specific management case getz et al 2018 and transferability schroeder and richter 1999 mieleitner and reichert 2006 randin et al 2006 wenger and olden 2012 yates et al 2018 also called universality or generality making the model applicable across a wide range of management cases or areas it is possible that a model that has an acceptable predictive performance is still not sensitive to the relevant management action this can have different reasons and therefore different implications for management first the model output variable may not be much affected by the management action this means that the management action would not be efficient to improve the ecological state of the system and other management alternatives should be considered second the input variable that is affected by the management may have too much measurement error or is too weakly linked to the management action while other explanatory variables not linked to management still lead to an acceptable predictive performance this would mean that the management effect is underestimated by the model and the data on the input variables need to be improved to better assess the effect of the management actions model transferability can be important for two reasons first high transferability regarding the geographic area of application and also regarding the management application increases the confidence in the mechanistic foundation of the model because it is less likely that the model just works due to spurious correlations see section 2 second a model with a larger transferability may be more useful for environmental management because it can be applied to more management cases this makes it easier to justify the time and effort that is invested into model development and application 6 2 how model validation is crucial to assess the predictive performance it is one of the most important steps during model development possibly requiring to re formulate the model or to acquire additional data commonly used validation techniques vary among disciplines from cross validation bootstrapping to jack knifing and often use a random splitting of the data for calibration or validation araujo et al 2005 independent validation data that has not been used for calibration helps identifying model accuracy and potential overfitting i e using a too complex model to reach a good fit to the calibration data while having a bad predictive performance for independent validation data a non random split of the data to groups that are spatially temporally or otherwise distinct may be used to assess model transferability and to avoid overfitting in the absence of data from independent sampling campaigns wenger and olden 2012 commonly used methods to assess goodness of fit model accuracy and predictive performance are model deviance from calibration and validation data respectively plotting mapping the model residuals or using multiple metrics that evaluate the model from different perspectives e g sensitivity and specificity which largely vary between application fields a comparison of the model with an appropriate null model e g a model without input variables highlights the explanatory power of the considered input variables and therefore helps judging its value for supporting the management decision additionally it is important to consider that even if models perform well this does not mean that model outputs are ecologically meaningful as e g high model evaluation scores do not necessarily go hand in hand with a useful model output section 2 domisch et al 2013 elith and graham 2009 this caveat is even more challenging when transferring the model in space or time for e g management or future scenarios araujo et al 2005 here an appropriate selection of scale section 4 may help to identify possible shortcomings in general starting with a simple model helps understanding the model structure and its behavior as well as gaining confidence into the model model complexity can be increased step wise by re assessing the predictive performance whether it has improved regarding sensitivity to the targeted management objective or increased transferability 6 3 future changes in the absence of adequate data knowledge to generate models that have a satisfying predictive performance environmental managers and decision makers often have concerns regarding the robustness of model outputs and do not take model predictions under different scenario assumptions into consideration this calls modelers to scrutinize the mechanisms and or acquire better data to improve the model and to assess practical implications of model results on decision making in the future data availability will increase which will help improving the predictive performance of models allow testing further hypotheses about cause effect relationships and targeting additional management objectives whose effects on the system could not be predicted before we expect that model validations will be more rigorous in the future along with a data availability at higher spatial and temporal scales 7 the modeling procedure model assumptions outcomes and deficits are transparently communicated 7 1 why an understandable and transparent communication about the whole modelling process is central for deriving realistic expectations regarding the potential of models for supporting management in pesticide risk assessment for example which can be viewed as a form of prospective environmental management ecological models are slowly becoming part of the assessment process that was so far mostly based on laboratory test and field studies forbes et al 2011 schmolke et al 2010a however interviews with stakeholders from industry the applicants for the registration of new products regulating authorities and academia revealed missing trust in models on the one hand and contradicting but high expectations on the other as main obstacles for making models a widely used method in this field hunka et al 2013 thorough and comprehensible documentation and communication would help preventing unrealistic expectations and building trust into models likewise it may foster the credibility of science in general if the scientific method of modeling is not perceived as a black box but as a tool that can be understood and discussed the same applies to model results and their uncertainty for potential end users the model results have to provide a clear message that is very easy to understand and communicate presenting model uncertainty to stakeholders in an understandable way might be a particular challenge and requires an adequate visual presentation model results must always be interpreted in light of the question the model was built to answer and the assumptions and simplifications made during the model development if and only if a model was a perfect description of the modeled system which is never the case the model results would completely reproduce the system s behavior although this textbook rule is plausible it can easily be forgotten hence clearly stating model assumptions fosters the correct interpretation of results gregr and chan 2014 at the same time it allows challenging these subjective assumptions furthermore model documentation and communication can serve as additional quality control for modelers because potential flaws in the conceptual model or in the implementation might be noticed during the process of preparing model descriptions likewise an accessible and comprehensive model description can support the learning process as it facilitates the discussion of our current understanding about cause effect relationships among peer modelers as well as with experts and stakeholders 7 2 how two points are of major importance for a transparent communication of the whole modeling process first models for environmental management and decision support should best be developed in close collaboration with decision makers and stakeholders hunka et al 2013 thereby the aim but also the limitations of the model could be clearer for all parties from the beginning it also prevents a situation where end users receive output from a black box that is difficult or impossible to interpret one crucial aspect of such a collaboration is to overcome transdisciplinary language barriers in some cases consulting companies can play a role to bridge between science and practice and to establish long term collaborations second careful documentation of the model itself but also of the background of its development implementation and validation is needed standard protocols for the whole documentation e g trace schmolke et al 2010b or tailored for certain model types or research questions e g for individual based models grimm et al 2010 or for population viability analyses pe er et al 2013 may be helpful typically different levels of documentation are needed to satisfy a heterogeneous audience of modelers other scientists practitioners and decision makers while a scientific journal article including a complete mathematical description of the model matches the expectation of the first group it does not necessarily suit the other groups a graphical representation of the model e g using conceptual diagrams will be appreciated by all groups the output of the model must be easy to understand by decision makers and stakeholders a summary report should include concise and robust take home messages derived from model results and the methodology followed nevertheless a critical assessment of the model should be part of every report clearly stating the model s provenance conceptual background the major simplifications the associated limitations and uncertainty of the outputs it should go without saying that model verification and validation statistics as well as estimates of predictive uncertainty are reported faithfully furthermore the fair principles for data management findability accessibility interoperability and reusability wilkinson et al 2016 should be applied as much as possible to models in order to let them be automatically discovered and used on line public access to the model s source code and documentation serves both verification by and discussion with peer scientists and it provides a basis for continuous development it is crucial that researchers make their models available and adopt open source modeling tools and methodologies such as r r core team 2019 so that models can be further developed by their community of users 7 3 future changes a promising approach to improved transparency is to separate the concept mathematical equations from the actual implementation in a computer code this has recently led to the development of largely self documenting mechanistic models which have the additional advantage to be re used and portable mooij et al 2014 kneis et al 2017 technologies that support interactive web based modeling evolve rapidly chang et al 2017 ooms 2014 we see this as a great chance to make end users more acquainted with their models and guarantee rapid feedback to developers we promote the use of online hosting repositories such as gitlab github or bitbucket that additionally to allowing code sharing include other functionalities such as version control bug tracking and wiki services hence they are ideal environments for collaborative model development especially for more complex models a collaboration with professional software developers might be beneficial e g to improve code testing maintenance or the development of user friendly interfaces additionally the collaborative development and testing of standard models for certain fields e g pesticide risk assessment e g european food safety authority 2016 coordinated by respected institutions or authorities in the field may foster agreement on model assumptions and structure thereby they facilitate building trust into models as tools for management the development of check lists and templates for model documentation will furthermore facilitate model development and communication 8 conclusions and final remarks with this paper we intend to stimulate a long needed discussion about how to facilitate the use of ecological models in decision making processes for environmental management we find this important because environmental management decisions should be based on the current state of knowledge and there seems to be a gap between the ecological modeling community and environmental managers that often hinders the application of ecological models in environmental decision making to change this in the future we outlined how the modeling process could be better aligned to the decision making process box 1 furthermore we identified and discussed six methodological requirements that we believe are important to make ecological models useful to inform environmental management decisions a crucial step for achieving these requirements is to foster collaboration and a transfer of knowledge on three different levels 1 transdisciplinary collaboration between ecological modelers and environmental managers as well as stakeholders to facilitate the alignment of the model to the management decision see box 1 to foster an appropriate interpretation of the results and to facilitate the implementation of results into the management decision parrott 2017 2 interdisciplinary collaboration between ecological modelers and empiricists to foster the integration of empirical data and mechanistic understanding about the system into the models 3 intradisciplinary collaboration between ecological modelers from different fields regarding modeling approaches see fig 2 dormann et al 2012 but also regarding fields of application e g terrestrial vs aquatic or marine vs freshwater ecosystems to foster the exchange of ideas methods and code mooij et al 2010 to engage in environmental decision making we as ecological modelers should seize opportunities to engage with the public or important stakeholder groups to exchange knowledge therefore it is important to know the policy processes and communication culture of decision makers to identify windows of opportunity to establish collaborations with environmental decision makers we should use our models to provide knowledge about consequences of management alternatives based on the best available science as objectively as possible by showing the advantages and disadvantages of each management alternative instead of only providing direct recommendations for certain management alternatives to facilitate this it is helpful to explicitly separate the objective prediction of consequences from subjective valuations about the importance of management objectives that should be inferred from democratic processes we have to communicate clearly the benefits of ecological models as well as any model deficits and their potential consequences and treat our models as tools to facilitate iterative learning and support adaptive management finally it should be noted that the sustainable development of ecological models for use in practice requires a stable institutional and personal infrastructure it can hardly be achieved during short term projects by persons with temporary employment with this paper we hope to raise awareness about challenges and opportunities for increasing the impact of ecological modeling on real world environmental decision

24972,understanding and predicting the ecological consequences of different management alternatives is becoming increasingly important to support environmental management decisions ecological models could contribute to such predictions but in the past this was often not the case ecological models are often developed within research projects but are rarely used for practical applications in this synthesis paper we discuss how to strengthen the role of ecological modeling in supporting environmental management decisions with a focus on methodological aspects we address mainly ecological modellers but also potential users of modeling results various modeling approaches can be used to predict the response of ecosystems to anthropogenic interventions including mechanistic models statistical models and machine learning approaches regardless of the chosen approach we outline how to better align the modeling to the decision making process and identify six requirements that we believe are important to increase the usefulness of ecological models for management support especially if management decisions need to be justified to the public these cover i a mechanistic understanding regarding causality ii alignment of model input and output with the management decision iii appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions iv uncertainty quantification v sufficient predictive performance and vi transparent communication we discuss challenges and synthesize suggestions for addressing these points keywords mechanistic models machine learning uncertainty calibration variable selection stakeholder theory based data science 1 introduction environmental management decisions should be based on the current state of scientific knowledge and at the same time account for multiple societal objectives that are of different importance for diverse stakeholders one important step in environmental decision support is the prediction of consequences of different management alternatives for the fulfillment of the societal objectives reichert et al 2015 ecological models can be used to support this step as far as ecological objectives are involved however so far this was often not the case i e valuable scientific knowledge is ignored addison et al 2013 in this paper we explore why this might be the case and how it could be changed in the future hence what components are particularly important and need more attention to make ecological modeling results useful for supporting environmental management two extreme views on ecological models exist either models are believed to be the solution and redemption of each and every problem without much questioning or they are perceived as tools that can be misused to provide any desired prediction and should therefore not be trusted at all both extremes may at least partly be attributed to missing knowledge on how model building works in general regarding the specific assumptions towards the model and its potential deficits with this paper we want to contribute to a more realistic judgement of the potential for ecological models to support environmental management we mainly address ecological modelers from various fields regarding modeling approaches and applications that want to increase the relevance of their model results for practice for potential users from practice this paper offers a summary regarding possible challenges and pitfalls of ecological models that should be considered when using model outputs for decision making there are numerous fields of environmental management where we see an increasing potential for ecological models to support environmental decision making examples are the spatial planning for endangered species conservation biodiversity protection habitat restoration and the assessment and management of ecosystem services alien species lakes and fisheries micropollutants including the registration of chemicals and risk assessment multiple stressors global environmental change and health risks e g from pathogenic microorganisms or antibiotic resistant bacteria examples for ecological models in these application fields are provided in the appendix table a1 however the involvement of ecological modeling in environmental decision making imposes several challenges first of all it requires collaboration between environmental decision makers and ecological modelers to develop a common understanding and enable knowledge transfer between science and practice in both directions e g jakeman et al 2006 voinov et al 2016 basco carrera et al 2017 parrott 2017 engineering consultants can play a role in this process as well additional challenges concern technical issues that are the focus of this paper depending on the availability of data and knowledge various modeling approaches can be used to answer management related questions section 2 1 here we discuss cross cutting issues that are important regardless of the specific modeling approach nevertheless depending on the choice of the model they can be more or less challenging to address the ideal model to support environmental management decisions can be directly linked to management objectives predicts effects of management alternatives without bias includes adequate precision and a correct estimate of prediction uncertainty is transferable in space and time and is easy to understand however real models are usually far from ideal we identified the following six requirements that we believe are important to achieve this as much as possible 1 there exists a basic mechanistic understanding of the system regarding causality which is considered in the model 2 the model input and output variables are aligned with the management question 3 the model has an appropriate spatial and temporal resolution to address the management question 4 the model uncertainty can be quantified 5 the model has a sufficient predictive performance to be useful for the management problem 6 the modeling procedure its assumptions and its deficits are transparently communicated in the following for each point we 1 discuss why we find it important 2 review how to address it in practice and 3 provide an outlook about how its implementation could be facilitated in the future the why sections address both model developers and environmental managers that may potentially benefit from ecological models while the how and future sections cover technical aspects that are of interest mainly for model developers furthermore we outline a way to integrate the ecological modeling process in the decision making process box 1 2 there exists a basic mechanistic understanding of the system regarding causality 2 1 why a model that is useful for environmental management needs to synthesize the most relevant aspects of our current knowledge regarding the system and how management actions impact relevant system components and processes the more knowledge exists about the system the better we can predict its response such knowledge can consist of mechanistic understanding and of empirical data while both are important for any ecological model various modeling approaches differ in their needs regarding the availability of each one fig 2 given a specific management question an appropriate modeling approach should be chosen accordingly robson 2014 baker et al 2018 recently the increasing availability of big data and computational power has allowed complex algorithmic machine learning artificial intelligence models to be developed seemingly overcoming issues of data and knowledge limitations such approaches do not rely on subjective prior knowledge and can search for patterns in available data without any prejudice however there is a danger of developing models based on easily available data as input variables also called predictor explanatory or independent variables that are somehow correlated with the model output variables i e response or dependent variables but without explicit consideration of cause effect mechanisms the use of biased input data can lead to biased results if input variables do not present mechanistically linked attributes of the system they may have limited practical value for environmental management or even produce false predictions based on spurious correlations in the data an additional danger when ignoring prior knowledge about important mechanisms is that the dynamic nature of the system is disregarded and important feedback loops between output variables are overlooked robson 2014 therefore we consider it important to build on existing mechanistic understanding of a system and invest in improving it regardless of which modeling approach is chosen a mechanistic or a data driven approach dormann et al 2012 this makes it less likely but not impossible that model results are biased and produce false predictions or correct predictions for the wrong reasons 2 2 how while the consideration of knowledge about cause effect mechanisms is an explicit step when developing mechanistic process based models we think it is also crucial for the development of any data driven statistical model this is especially true if it should inform management decisions first of all the explicit consideration of cause effect mechanisms facilitates the choice of an appropriate model structure or potential candidate model structures to be tested including an appropriate description of model errors for instance when building a multivariate statistical model we may have to decide if it should be a linear generalized linear or non linear model and may have to choose a link function and make distributional assumptions furthermore some mechanistic understanding can help with the pre selection of input variables actually the inclusion of input variables can be seen as a formulation of hypotheses and the selection procedure as a falsification process this process has major implications on the outcomes of the model and the conclusions for management one step in the direction of considering cause effect mechanisms is the distinction of direct and indirect influence factors for direct influence factors e g temperature we have a basic mechanistic understanding of how they influence the output variables e g reproduction of organisms even if we use empirical functional relationships to parameterize the model and infer the parameters from the data conversely indirect influence factors e g altitude are those that influence the direct ones and therefore only indirectly affect the output variables models that use direct influence factors as input variables have the potential to be more general transferable than models based on indirect influence factors guisan and zimmermann 2000 but data on direct influence factors is not always available validation of the model outcomes with independent data may help evaluating whether the model captures the most important influence factors and cause effect relationships or if a good model fit during calibration is just caused by overfitting or confounding variables to close data gaps in space and or time direct influence factors can be predicted through the formulation of models from indirect ones e g water temperature hill et al 2014 however this introduces additional uncertainty to the model see section 5 finding a solid mechanistic basis for any modeling approach benefits from a close collaboration between the experts in charge of gathering data e g field ecologists experimentalists who have practical knowledge about the system and the modelers that are able to express this knowledge in mathematical terms in addition more exchange between the different fields of ecological modeling could facilitate model comparisons across the range of statistical and mechanistic models such a comparison could reveal the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to address specific management questions and help improving both types of models for data rich situations a promising approach may be to use rather unconstrained data driven e g machine learning deep learning methods for a first exploratory analysis to detect patterns in the data however it should be noted that such purely data driven models may be poor for predicting outside the range of calibration therefore we suggest confronting this information with prior mechanistic knowledge about the system in a next step this could then lead to the development of models that consider mechanistic knowledge and can be used to test hypotheses regarding cause effect relationships e g peters et al 2014 feld et al 2016 purely data driven models can then serve as a benchmark regarding the predictive performance for models with a more constraint model structure for rather data poor situations it might be possible to transfer knowledge from other systems and test it with new data in a bayesian framework 2 3 future changes currently many machine learning models are good in predicting if applied within their calibrated range however their internal structure is often not accessible and therefore hard to understand therefore they are perceived as black boxes castelvecchi 2016 attempts in data science to open the black box of such purely data driven algorithmic models may help extracting mechanistic understanding from big data this may further develop to what we call theory based data science box 2 fig 2 where both mechanistic understanding and a flexible structure which is derived from data analysis can be combined using synergies between complementary modeling approaches will advance mechanistic understanding and predictive performance of ecological models baker et al 2018 robson 2014 in parallel the increasing development of large scale experimental facilities e g mesocosms will contribute to the validation of cause effect hypotheses while the use of mechanistic models may contribute to improve experimental design for example if a data driven model detects an effect of an input variable on the abundance of a certain species a mesocosm study could be set up to manipulate this input variable to verify if it has an effect in a second step a mechanistic model could be calibrated to the data of a first set of experiments e g the time series of the development of a population and the model can then be used to test e g the effect of an improved or reduced temporal resolution of the experimental data on the parameter estimates likewise the implementation of management measures e g upgrade of waste water treatment plans morphological restoration of rivers measures to improve the trophic state of lakes offers the opportunity to use these as large scale experiments and derive monitoring data with a strong experimental design e g before after control impact stewart oaten et al 1986 to strengthen cause effect linkages detect feedback loops and to validate and improve model predictions further long term ecological monitoring programs have started to coordinate their work at regional and global scales while emphasizing societally relevant information on the sustainable use of natural resources mirtl et al 2018 the resulting field data is highly relevant homogeneous and continuous in time facilitating the identification of causal relationships the coordination of these different data and knowledge sources requires anticipatory planning funding that covers a long time horizon and close collaboration of various experts 3 the model considers input and output variables that are relevant for management 3 1 why to be useful for environmental management model outputs have to be aligned with management objectives while model inputs have to reflect environmental factors that influence the model outputs and are influenced by the management alternatives that are of interest for the decision makers or stakeholders fig 1 with such a model we can analyze management scenarios by modifying the input variables subject to anthropogenic changes and learning about their potential effects on the management objectives for instance a model describing local species diversity will not be useful for supporting the management objective of stopping a certain target species decline in abundance because the output variable is not aligned to the management objective on the other hand a model predicting a target species abundance based only on latitude and temperature as input variables will not be useful either if the potential management alternatives affect water quality while seemingly trivial in practice it might be a major challenge to identify and incorporate relevant input and output variables or output variables with sufficient sensitivity to the input variables that are relevant for management 3 2 how the alignment of model input and output variables with the management questions requires a clear understanding of management objectives and an agreement about how to measure their fulfillment based on attributes of the system e g fish biodiversity measured as the number of different fish species occurring in the respective catchment furthermore it requires an identification of important drivers that can be linked to potential management alternatives to be considered e g longitudinal connectivity to be increased through the removal of barriers or water quality to be improved by upgrading wastewater treatment plants towards the removal of micropollutants this can be reached by a dialogue between modelers decision makers and stakeholders e g within a co design process multi criteria decision analysis and problem structuring methods can support this phase e g keeney 1982 1996 the next step is then to develop a conceptual model that describes the cause effect linkages between the drivers that are affected by the management alternatives and the ecological variables that can be linked to the management objectives see section 2 2 on direct and indirect influence factors depending on the management situation decision makers may be interested in learning about the relative importance of anthropogenic stressors to identify deficits and potential management alternatives to address them in other situations they might be interested in predicting the effects of already identified management alternatives in both cases models can be useful if they include important input variables that may influence the fulfillment of the management objective this is true even if some of the input variables are out of scope of local management e g socio economic or climate variables and even if they are difficult to project into the future e g land use or technological changes in such cases model based scenario analysis can be used to conditionally predict the potential effects of the respective management alternatives taking into account various assumptions about future changes in variables that cannot be controlled by the decision makers such an approach can help in the process of identifying cost effective management alternatives i e alternatives that reach defined management targets with the least costs moreover it allows us to identify management alternatives that are robust to future unmanageable changes however this might require to consider additional input variables which may increase model complexity ideally robust management alternatives aimed at mitigating local or regional impacts will be developed while considering larger scales or global changes the challenge consists in balancing model complexity considering many variables and their interactions to increase realism and model simplicity highlighting the most relevant factors to increase understandability and reduce development computation and maintenance costs e g fulton et al 2004 bunnefeld et al 2011 a framework for assessing model structure adequacy was recently proposed by getz et al 2018 in our view the interaction with the decision makers guisan et al 2013 and or experts in the field is vital to test the plausibility of the models through repeated iterations testing different management strategies which represent different input variables at different intensities implemented at different spatio temporal scales the performance and realism of ecological models and their outcomes can be improved such trial and error exercises are actually one of the advantages of ecological models as in silico hypothesis testing can save resources and time 3 3 future changes new data analysis approaches in addition to recent developments in remote and in situ sensing are already delivering a wide range of variables that describe anthropogenic impairments on ecosystems bush et al 2017 novel datasets incorporate a large variety of highly relevant input variables into environmental models including global annual land use land cover changes esa climate change initiative land cover regional climatic conditions at a daily temporal resolution haylock et al 2008 and global freshwater specific predictor variables domisch et al 2015 furthermore remote sensing techniques are capable of providing detailed information on local conditions such as water temperature patterns recorded by drones a large untapped potential remains to be explored and tested in this domain pettorelli et al 2014 see jones et al 2016 for an example such large datasets describing variables that govern ecosystems along the hierarchy of different nested scales are becoming widely available also to the general public due to open access policies and on line repositories increasing the spatio temporal resolution of input variables should help improving the robustness of the models and the accuracy of the output this in turn fosters the support of environmental management decisions however larger model extents and improved variable resolution may also increase the challenge of uncertainty quantification section 5 furthermore untangling the effect of large scale overriding factors and their interplay with local conditions may be challenging besides increasing the resolution of independent environmental variables it is necessary to additionally invest in improving the temporal spatial and taxonomic resolution of the response variables i e biological variables high throughput dna sequencing methods e g metabarcoding will provide new opportunities and challenges in this regard bush et al 2017 hering et al 2018 furthermore openly accessible data repositories wilkinson et al 2016 will contribute to the availability of biological data some of them cover the global scale and all taxa e g gbif www gbif org while others provide information of specific geographic regions and ecosystem types e g schmidt kloiber and hering 2015 4 the model has an appropriate spatial and temporal resolution for addressing the management problem 4 1 why for adequately addressing a management question ecological models need to account for the often administratively determined temporal and spatial scales relevant for the management situation however in addition the ecology and natural dynamics of the system need to be considered with the model s resolution reflecting a balance between the scale of the management problem and the level of ecological detail needed to produce meaningful time and space units rahbek 2005 elith and leathwick 2009 martínez lópez et al 2016 for example a nationwide biodiversity management strategy planned for the next 50 years might benefit from a species distribution model representing general and macro scale patterns and processes using coarse spatial grid units and decadal time steps while little value would be added by including diurnal migration patterns of species to this model a site specific management plan however might benefit from the explicit inclusion of diurnal migration patterns in order to identify specific habitat units in need of protection hence avoiding a mismatch in scale between model management plan and ecological processes is an important cornerstone for creating models representing ecological processes of management relevance increasingly models are used to make predictions towards new locations or into the future the models are then applied outside the domain in which they were developed requiring careful consideration of model uncertainties and associated predictive performance under these new conditions hence the decision about a suitable spatial extent and time horizon is crucial 4 2 how a first step towards identifying the appropriate scales is to map the processes dependencies drivers and pressures that are relevant for the management problem in a conceptual model linkage map prior to any data analyses such linkage mapping provides a comprehensive overview of dependencies this assists in increasing the mechanistic foundation of the model allowing for the selection of causally linked influence factors and the appropriate spatial and temporal resolution in which they operate moreover spatial dependencies and temporal lag effects can be identified where the source may be spatially and or temporally disconnected from the impact this is for instance the case in considering effects of micro plastics which can travel long distances often changing in toxicity due to fragmentation sorption of pollutants and fouling by potentially pathogenic communities along the way before accumulating at sink locations far away from original sources vermeiren et al 2016 after carefully filtering the most relevant processes in collaboration with experts in the field the potential input variables should become clear as well as the appropriate scale that should match the output variable to reduce uncertainties in the model a conceptual model can be developed with input from stakeholders experts and the literature this helps identifying the adequate breadth coverage of important aspects and depth level of detail of the model to answer the management question note that the focus might need to be widened to capture the full range of relevant processes for instance the spatial scale of a model and thus the spatial scale of the input data can be broader than the spatial area in which it will be applied in order to provide a better coverage of certain environmental variables this is of particular relevance when predictions to new environmental conditions e g increased temperature or reduced pollutant concentrations are made which are not included in the current area to be managed avoiding e g non analogue climates in future predictions in such cases visualization techniques can support the exploration of model behaviour and predictions to novel environments e g zurell et al 2012 however data might not always be available at the appropriate spatial and temporal resolution or within the range of the environmental variables in which the model will operate in such cases uncertainty assessment as discussed in section 5 becomes of paramount importance 4 3 future changes we are in an exciting era of increasing data availability e g stemming from wireless real time monitoring systems edna analyses remote sensing images over large spatial extents and at short time intervals and capacity to collect and store these data which can dramatically increase the spatial and temporal resolution of ecological data and thereby ecological models the flexibility and dynamic features of models may particularly benefit where time series of both input and output variables are available the appropriate curation and documentation and continuous work on incorporating these data into useful ecological models is crucial to benefit best from them the latter includes mapping linkages between management actions and ecosystem properties and ecosystem processes in conceptual models and formalizing and testing these links in temporally and spatially explicit quantitative models 5 model uncertainty can be quantified 5 1 why all models are prone to various sources of uncertainty in addition to inherent stochasticity of environmental systems uncertainty originates from model inputs explanatory variables model structure and model parameters knutti 2008 even observed data used for model calibration and validation are subject to uncertainty owing to imperfect sampling and measurement procedures to allow environmental managers to interpret model results correctly and draw robust conclusions it is essential to provide an estimate of model uncertainty along with the expected value of model outcomes fischhoff and davis 2014 buisson et al 2010 uusitalo et al 2015 only then well informed decisions can be made even if uncertainty bounds between management alternatives largely overlap it might be possible to take a clear decision if it is evident that some of the alternatives lead to changes in the desired direction reichert and borsuk 2005 uncertainty information helps decision makers to develop realistic expectations regarding the predicted effects of management alternatives wardekker et al 2008 and allows considering their own risk attitude keeney 1982 so called risk neutral decision makers prefer the alternative with the highest expected value independent from its uncertainty risk averse decision makers on the other hand prefer alternatives with a lower uncertainty even if their expected value is slightly lower compared to other alternatives with higher uncertainty additionally a description of uncertainty facilitates the learning process wardekker et al 2008 and adaptive management being transparent about the uncertainty of predictions finally increases credibility of scientists 5 2 how while information on model uncertainty is indispensable for decision making warmink et al 2010 uncertainty is often difficult to quantify most tangible is the quantification of input and parameter uncertainty first uncertainty estimates for all model input variables and parameters have to be collected this uncertainty can be described by probability distributions reichert et al 2015 in a second step input uncertainty has to be propagated through the model to the outputs for non linear models monte carlo simulation is the standard approach however it may be computationally demanding depending on the model runtime several methods exist to infer parameters and their uncertainty from data this is sometimes called inverse modeling if no prior knowledge about the model parameters and their uncertainty exists but there is enough data for model calibration parameters can be inferred using frequentist statistics neyman 1937 e g maximum likelihood estimation see standard textbooks however this is only possible if all parameters are identifiable from the data parameters may be unidentifiable due to a lack of sensitivity of the model to some of the parameters or due to correlations among parameters i e if several combinations of parameter values lead to the same model output based on certain assumptions it is possible to derive estimates of confidence intervals for parameters and model outputs e g using a profile likelihood approach montoya et al 2009 ideally the model is validated with independent data section 6 whenever prior knowledge about parameter values is available e g from previous model applications experiments or ecological theory e g robson et al 2018 and data for calibration exist bayesian inference can be applied it offers a consistent framework to combine both prior information and data to derive the best predictions possible based on the current state of knowledge gelman et al 2014 ellison 2004 it allows to consistently update the information when new data becomes available many software tools exist that facilitate bayesian inference see krapu and borsuk 2019 such as winbugs lunn et al 2000 jags plummer 2003 or stan carpenter et al 2017 and can be run on or linked to various platforms for statistical computing e g r r core team 2019 however a solid mathematical understanding of the underlying concepts is needed to choose an adequate setup of the inference algorithm and to identify and solve numerical problems e g regarding efficiency and convergence bayesian inference is even more computationally demanding than just forward propagation of uncertainty as it requires a larger number of model runs it may become infeasible if a single model run consumes much computation time e g several minutes and or when the posterior parameter distribution has a complex structure which increases the number of required model runs although structural inadequacy i e model structure error makes a large contribution to total uncertainty of environmental models refsgaard et al 2006 this aspect is still underrepresented in current practice in some fields of ecological modeling e g mechanistic ecosystem models while it is popular in others e g species distribution models araujo and new 2007 in recent years a number of studies employed multi model ensembles to also consider structural uncertainty in analyses of environmental management scenarios lenhart et al 2010 ramin et al 2012 trolle et al 2014 although the approach of multi model ensembles is promising it is not without limitations janssen et al 2015 a practical problem especially with mechanistic models is the considerable effort needed for setting up and running multiple models in parallel in other fields e g in species distribution modeling different challenges exist one of them is to check whether the calibration leads to reasonable results in all models in the ensemble and whether they are in accordance to our current mechanistic understanding e g if coefficients have the correct sign or response curves have an adequate shape a conceptual problem lies in the subjective choice of models and a possible underestimation of uncertainty if the chosen models are too similar a recent review confirms that model averaging is particularly useful if the covariance between models is low dormann et al 2018 as discussed in the previous sections scenario analyses can help exploring the robustness of model outcomes to future changes that are too hard to predict 5 3 future changes the current push for increasing computational resources and the development of more efficient algorithms such as approximate bayesian computation e g albert et al 2015 will facilitate solving inference problems that were computationally too expensive in the past the use of high performance computing methods that allow parallelization and the use of supercomputers will contribute to this development e g sukys and kattwinkel 2017 the development of emulators simplifications of the original simulation models that speed up simulation times for the costs of additional uncertainty are another line of current research that might facilitate the quantification of uncertainty for slow models e g carbajal et al 2017 the increasing availability of high resolution data makes the formulation of models even more challenging because basic statistical assumptions e g with regard to the independence of observations may no longer hold and more sophisticated formulations of error models may be required e g to consider autocorrelation furthermore with improved measurement techniques intrinsic environmental and or demographic stochasticity of the system may dominate over measurement error therefore the development of stochastic ecological models will gain importance examples are stochastic differential equations and individual based also called agent based models for population dynamics that consider demographic stochasticity applying bayesian inference to such stochastic models is a huge challenge and the development of efficient algorithms is becoming a research area of increasing importance kattwinkel and reichert 2017 joining mathematical and computational skills with the ecological knowledge about the system and an understanding of the management problems is a considerable challenge consequently there is a great need for inter and transdisciplinary collaboration to effectively progress towards useful and applicable ecological modeling e g voinov and bousquet 2010 basco carrera et al 2017 parrott 2017 martínez lópez et al 2019 in addition educating scientists from various fields in data science including bayesian statistics will facilitate knowledge transfer and collaboration among different disciplines 6 the model has sufficient predictive performance 6 1 why any model that aims at informing environmental management objectives should have a decent predictive performance as otherwise it is useless in addition two aspects are important model sensitivity to the specific management case getz et al 2018 and transferability schroeder and richter 1999 mieleitner and reichert 2006 randin et al 2006 wenger and olden 2012 yates et al 2018 also called universality or generality making the model applicable across a wide range of management cases or areas it is possible that a model that has an acceptable predictive performance is still not sensitive to the relevant management action this can have different reasons and therefore different implications for management first the model output variable may not be much affected by the management action this means that the management action would not be efficient to improve the ecological state of the system and other management alternatives should be considered second the input variable that is affected by the management may have too much measurement error or is too weakly linked to the management action while other explanatory variables not linked to management still lead to an acceptable predictive performance this would mean that the management effect is underestimated by the model and the data on the input variables need to be improved to better assess the effect of the management actions model transferability can be important for two reasons first high transferability regarding the geographic area of application and also regarding the management application increases the confidence in the mechanistic foundation of the model because it is less likely that the model just works due to spurious correlations see section 2 second a model with a larger transferability may be more useful for environmental management because it can be applied to more management cases this makes it easier to justify the time and effort that is invested into model development and application 6 2 how model validation is crucial to assess the predictive performance it is one of the most important steps during model development possibly requiring to re formulate the model or to acquire additional data commonly used validation techniques vary among disciplines from cross validation bootstrapping to jack knifing and often use a random splitting of the data for calibration or validation araujo et al 2005 independent validation data that has not been used for calibration helps identifying model accuracy and potential overfitting i e using a too complex model to reach a good fit to the calibration data while having a bad predictive performance for independent validation data a non random split of the data to groups that are spatially temporally or otherwise distinct may be used to assess model transferability and to avoid overfitting in the absence of data from independent sampling campaigns wenger and olden 2012 commonly used methods to assess goodness of fit model accuracy and predictive performance are model deviance from calibration and validation data respectively plotting mapping the model residuals or using multiple metrics that evaluate the model from different perspectives e g sensitivity and specificity which largely vary between application fields a comparison of the model with an appropriate null model e g a model without input variables highlights the explanatory power of the considered input variables and therefore helps judging its value for supporting the management decision additionally it is important to consider that even if models perform well this does not mean that model outputs are ecologically meaningful as e g high model evaluation scores do not necessarily go hand in hand with a useful model output section 2 domisch et al 2013 elith and graham 2009 this caveat is even more challenging when transferring the model in space or time for e g management or future scenarios araujo et al 2005 here an appropriate selection of scale section 4 may help to identify possible shortcomings in general starting with a simple model helps understanding the model structure and its behavior as well as gaining confidence into the model model complexity can be increased step wise by re assessing the predictive performance whether it has improved regarding sensitivity to the targeted management objective or increased transferability 6 3 future changes in the absence of adequate data knowledge to generate models that have a satisfying predictive performance environmental managers and decision makers often have concerns regarding the robustness of model outputs and do not take model predictions under different scenario assumptions into consideration this calls modelers to scrutinize the mechanisms and or acquire better data to improve the model and to assess practical implications of model results on decision making in the future data availability will increase which will help improving the predictive performance of models allow testing further hypotheses about cause effect relationships and targeting additional management objectives whose effects on the system could not be predicted before we expect that model validations will be more rigorous in the future along with a data availability at higher spatial and temporal scales 7 the modeling procedure model assumptions outcomes and deficits are transparently communicated 7 1 why an understandable and transparent communication about the whole modelling process is central for deriving realistic expectations regarding the potential of models for supporting management in pesticide risk assessment for example which can be viewed as a form of prospective environmental management ecological models are slowly becoming part of the assessment process that was so far mostly based on laboratory test and field studies forbes et al 2011 schmolke et al 2010a however interviews with stakeholders from industry the applicants for the registration of new products regulating authorities and academia revealed missing trust in models on the one hand and contradicting but high expectations on the other as main obstacles for making models a widely used method in this field hunka et al 2013 thorough and comprehensible documentation and communication would help preventing unrealistic expectations and building trust into models likewise it may foster the credibility of science in general if the scientific method of modeling is not perceived as a black box but as a tool that can be understood and discussed the same applies to model results and their uncertainty for potential end users the model results have to provide a clear message that is very easy to understand and communicate presenting model uncertainty to stakeholders in an understandable way might be a particular challenge and requires an adequate visual presentation model results must always be interpreted in light of the question the model was built to answer and the assumptions and simplifications made during the model development if and only if a model was a perfect description of the modeled system which is never the case the model results would completely reproduce the system s behavior although this textbook rule is plausible it can easily be forgotten hence clearly stating model assumptions fosters the correct interpretation of results gregr and chan 2014 at the same time it allows challenging these subjective assumptions furthermore model documentation and communication can serve as additional quality control for modelers because potential flaws in the conceptual model or in the implementation might be noticed during the process of preparing model descriptions likewise an accessible and comprehensive model description can support the learning process as it facilitates the discussion of our current understanding about cause effect relationships among peer modelers as well as with experts and stakeholders 7 2 how two points are of major importance for a transparent communication of the whole modeling process first models for environmental management and decision support should best be developed in close collaboration with decision makers and stakeholders hunka et al 2013 thereby the aim but also the limitations of the model could be clearer for all parties from the beginning it also prevents a situation where end users receive output from a black box that is difficult or impossible to interpret one crucial aspect of such a collaboration is to overcome transdisciplinary language barriers in some cases consulting companies can play a role to bridge between science and practice and to establish long term collaborations second careful documentation of the model itself but also of the background of its development implementation and validation is needed standard protocols for the whole documentation e g trace schmolke et al 2010b or tailored for certain model types or research questions e g for individual based models grimm et al 2010 or for population viability analyses pe er et al 2013 may be helpful typically different levels of documentation are needed to satisfy a heterogeneous audience of modelers other scientists practitioners and decision makers while a scientific journal article including a complete mathematical description of the model matches the expectation of the first group it does not necessarily suit the other groups a graphical representation of the model e g using conceptual diagrams will be appreciated by all groups the output of the model must be easy to understand by decision makers and stakeholders a summary report should include concise and robust take home messages derived from model results and the methodology followed nevertheless a critical assessment of the model should be part of every report clearly stating the model s provenance conceptual background the major simplifications the associated limitations and uncertainty of the outputs it should go without saying that model verification and validation statistics as well as estimates of predictive uncertainty are reported faithfully furthermore the fair principles for data management findability accessibility interoperability and reusability wilkinson et al 2016 should be applied as much as possible to models in order to let them be automatically discovered and used on line public access to the model s source code and documentation serves both verification by and discussion with peer scientists and it provides a basis for continuous development it is crucial that researchers make their models available and adopt open source modeling tools and methodologies such as r r core team 2019 so that models can be further developed by their community of users 7 3 future changes a promising approach to improved transparency is to separate the concept mathematical equations from the actual implementation in a computer code this has recently led to the development of largely self documenting mechanistic models which have the additional advantage to be re used and portable mooij et al 2014 kneis et al 2017 technologies that support interactive web based modeling evolve rapidly chang et al 2017 ooms 2014 we see this as a great chance to make end users more acquainted with their models and guarantee rapid feedback to developers we promote the use of online hosting repositories such as gitlab github or bitbucket that additionally to allowing code sharing include other functionalities such as version control bug tracking and wiki services hence they are ideal environments for collaborative model development especially for more complex models a collaboration with professional software developers might be beneficial e g to improve code testing maintenance or the development of user friendly interfaces additionally the collaborative development and testing of standard models for certain fields e g pesticide risk assessment e g european food safety authority 2016 coordinated by respected institutions or authorities in the field may foster agreement on model assumptions and structure thereby they facilitate building trust into models as tools for management the development of check lists and templates for model documentation will furthermore facilitate model development and communication 8 conclusions and final remarks with this paper we intend to stimulate a long needed discussion about how to facilitate the use of ecological models in decision making processes for environmental management we find this important because environmental management decisions should be based on the current state of knowledge and there seems to be a gap between the ecological modeling community and environmental managers that often hinders the application of ecological models in environmental decision making to change this in the future we outlined how the modeling process could be better aligned to the decision making process box 1 furthermore we identified and discussed six methodological requirements that we believe are important to make ecological models useful to inform environmental management decisions a crucial step for achieving these requirements is to foster collaboration and a transfer of knowledge on three different levels 1 transdisciplinary collaboration between ecological modelers and environmental managers as well as stakeholders to facilitate the alignment of the model to the management decision see box 1 to foster an appropriate interpretation of the results and to facilitate the implementation of results into the management decision parrott 2017 2 interdisciplinary collaboration between ecological modelers and empiricists to foster the integration of empirical data and mechanistic understanding about the system into the models 3 intradisciplinary collaboration between ecological modelers from different fields regarding modeling approaches see fig 2 dormann et al 2012 but also regarding fields of application e g terrestrial vs aquatic or marine vs freshwater ecosystems to foster the exchange of ideas methods and code mooij et al 2010 to engage in environmental decision making we as ecological modelers should seize opportunities to engage with the public or important stakeholder groups to exchange knowledge therefore it is important to know the policy processes and communication culture of decision makers to identify windows of opportunity to establish collaborations with environmental decision makers we should use our models to provide knowledge about consequences of management alternatives based on the best available science as objectively as possible by showing the advantages and disadvantages of each management alternative instead of only providing direct recommendations for certain management alternatives to facilitate this it is helpful to explicitly separate the objective prediction of consequences from subjective valuations about the importance of management objectives that should be inferred from democratic processes we have to communicate clearly the benefits of ecological models as well as any model deficits and their potential consequences and treat our models as tools to facilitate iterative learning and support adaptive management finally it should be noted that the sustainable development of ecological models for use in practice requires a stable institutional and personal infrastructure it can hardly be achieved during short term projects by persons with temporary employment with this paper we hope to raise awareness about challenges and opportunities for increasing the impact of ecological modeling on real world environmental decision

24973,arenicola marina is a polychaete lophotrochozoan displaying a complex bentho pelagic life cycle with two larval dispersal phases only partially described up to now a dynamic energy budget deb model was applied to the species in order to reconstruct its life cycle and growth under in situ environmental conditions two types of deb models are usually applied to other lophotrochozoans displaying similar life cycles the standard std model applied to polychaetes 5 entries among the 1524 of the add my pet database on the 18 10 2018 and the abj model which includes an acceleration of metabolism between birth and metamorphosis and which has been applied to most molluscs 77 abj entries out of the 80 mollusc entries enabling better fit predictions for the early life stages the parameter estimation was performed with both models to assess the suitability of an abj model for a marina the zero variate dataset consisted of length and age data at different life cycle stages the lifespan the maximum observed length and the wet weight of an egg the uni variate dataset consisted of two growth experiments from the literature at two food levels and several temperatures laboratory data of oxygen consumption at several temperatures and fecundity for different lengths the predictions of the abj model fitted better to the data smse 0 29 the acceleration coefficient was ca 11 which is similar to mollusc values the field growth curves and the scaled functional responses as a proxy of food levels were suitably reconstructed with the new parameter set the reconstruction of the early life stages chronology according to in situ environmental conditions of a temperate marine ecosystem indicated a first dispersal phase of 5 days followed by a 7 months temporary settlement before a second dispersal phase in spring at the end of metamorphosis we emphasize the need for using abj models for polychaetes in future studies keywords bioenergetics lugworm growth oxygen consumption life history traits dispersal 1 introduction arenicola marina linnaeus 1758 is a marine polychaete lophotrochozoan annelida inhabiting most intertidal soft sediments from the arctic to the mediterranean the species is intensively dug for bait by recreational fishermen blake 1979 de cubber et al 2018 watson et al 2017 and the comparison between harvest efforts and observed populations abundance has evidenced the need for some regulation of this activity in some places de cubber et al 2018 in aquaculture a marina is also reared for bait olive et al 2006 and more recently for its particular haemoglobin that might represent a valuable blood substitute for humans in the future rousselot et al 2006 and which is already used for organs conservation before transplantation however its complex bentho pelagic life cycle with two dispersal phases before recruitment has made the description of the early life stages and their chronology complicated and still little is known about the development of a marina between the trochophore larva stage and the benthic recruitment farke and berghuis 1979a b newell 1948 reise 1985 moreover the literature regarding a marina s life cycle and growth is quite ancient mostly from 1979 and since 1990 it has been found that two cryptic species actually exist and might live in sympatry a marina and a defodiens therefore ancient life history description has to be used with caution cadman and nelson smith 1990 the dynamic energy budget deb theory quantifies the energy allocation to growth and reproduction of an individual during its life cycle according to environmental conditions such as temperature and food availability kooijman 2010 even in species with complex and numerous life stages llandres et al 2015 twelve primary parameters are sufficient for the implementation of a standard std deb model however among the assumptions implied in std deb models some like isomorphism during growth the fact that growth always follows a typical von bertalanffy growth curve or the presence of three life stages embryo juvenile and adult are not found in every species therefore extensions of the std model implying the use of more parameters were created kooijman 2014 accounting for deviations from typical development implied by the std model like foetal development acceleration of metabolism or extra life stages as of october 2018 add my pet amp database estimated deb parameters for 1524 animal species marques et al 2018 among these entries only 11 were annelid species 4 of them being polychaetes species for which std models were applied the closest phylum with a large amount of data is the molluscs phylum over 80 entries also presenting a larval stage indeed annelids and molluscs belong to the lophotrochozoan clade and both after the embryogenesis lead to a trochophore larval stage mostly abj deb models have been applied only for the mollusc phylum which are an extension of std models considering an acceleration of metabolism between birth first feeding and metamorphosis end of the change of shape and are applied to most species with a larval phase kooijman 2014 although polychaete species often present a larval phase during their life cycle until now abj models were not applied to these taxa a std entry for a marina is present in the amp database and enables predictions of the growth and reproduction of the species however more than half of the dataset used for the parameter estimation consists of unpublished data time since birth at puberty and maximum reproduction rate taken from marlin https www marlin ac uk and lifespan and ultimate total length taken from wikipedia https www wikipedia org guessed data wet weight at birth and puberty ultimate wet weight or data related to other species age at birth from a cristata and a brasiliensis amp entry bas kooijman 2015 amp arenicola marina version 12 07 2015 we therefore completed the dataset with literature experimental and field data and implemented a new parameter estimation for the species using both a std and an abj deb models the objectives were 1 to calibrate a deb model for a marina based on a reliable and complete dataset and adapted to its life cycle features and therefore to compare the relevance of the use a std or an abj deb model for this species 2 to make predictions about the chronology of the early life stages of a marina and the growth potential according to the environmental conditions 3 to compare the parameters of the deb models implemented for a marina with the other lophotrochozoan species parameters and discuss the advantages of the use of an abj model for this species 2 material and methods 2 1 the deb theory and its implementation for a marina 2 1 1 the model the deb theory describes the energy flows within an organism between three compartments state variables the reserve e the structure v and the maturity e h or the reproduction buffer offsprings e r according to its life stage in order to describe its energy allocation to growth and reproduction for a given food level and at a reference temperature t ref fig 1 the three differential equations linked to the state variables are obtained from the expression of the different fluxes table 1 kooijman 2010 van der meer 2006 temperature corrections are made to the rates considered by the model in the equation of fluxes e g the surface area specific maximum assimilation rate p a m j cm 2 d 1 the energy conductance v cm d 1 the specific volume linked somatic maintenance rate p m j cm 3 d 1 and the maturity maintenance rate coefficient k j d 1 see tables 1 and 4 indeed when the temperature t k is different from the reference temperature t ref taken to be 293 15 k these rates are multiplied by the correction given in eq 1 where t a is the arrhenius temperature k k 1 the rate of interest at t ref and k the rate of interest at t 1 k t k 1 exp t a t ref t a t the links between observable metrics

de cubber et al 2018 watson et al 2000 after the external fertilization the embryo develops in the female gallery up to the post embryonic stage the trochophore larva which is able to move vertically in the water column fig 2 farke and berghuis 1979a b at this time the shape is changing from ovoidal oocytes with a shape coefficient δ δ me to cylindrical when the trochophore larva gradually acquires new setiger becoming a metatrochophore larva of shape coefficient δ δ me the metatrochophore larva is released in the water column when it reaches 3 setigers and is transported by currents during several days in lugworms embryos and larvae are lecithotrophic living on maternal reserve and therefore supposed not to be able to feed the maturity threshold e h did not yet reach its value for birth e h e h b where birth is the time when individuals start to feed therefore there is no feeding or assimilation flux during the embryo and larval stage and de dt p c table 1 moreover these young stages do not have enough complexity yet to be able to produce gametes and the reproduction flux goes to maturity table 1 which represents in this case the acquisition of complexity of the individual fig 1 the metatrochophore larva settles and begins eating as post larva when the gut appears functional e h e h b either on mussel beds macroalgae or sheltered soft sediment bottoms fig 2 at this point it lives inside a mucus tube stuck to the bottom and feeds on the particles deposited on the tube and around it as well as on suspended particles farke and berghuis 1979a b newell 1949 reise 1985 reise et al 2001 during this temporary settlement period the post larva continues to gradually acquire new setigers up to the 19 final setigers found in adults the shape coefficient δ keeps on decreasing until it reaches the shape coefficient value of the adults δ m developing a proboscis in the way of the adults farke and berghuis 1979a b newell 1949 these morphological changes are assimilated to metamorphosis up to when the maturity threshold e h reaches its value at metamorphosis e h e h j during this period a metabolic acceleration kooijman 2014 was considered which is supposed to happen in most species that have a larval phase frequently coinciding with morphological metamorphosis marques et al 2018 and resulting in an exponential growth of the organism between the first feeding and the end of metamorphosis from birth e h e h b feeding and assimilation are not null anymore but individuals are not able yet to produce gametes p r 0 when metamorphosis ends a second dispersal phase of unknown period occurs in the water column and the newly juvenile lugworm settles on intertidal areas colonized by adults lugworms where it changes its mode of nutrition becoming psammivorous like the adults beukema and de vlas 1979 fig 2 the shape coefficient value stops changing the growth starts to be isomorphic and follows the von bertalanffy growth curve for a constant scaled functional response kooijman 2010 but it is not yet able to reproduce like the adults since the maturity threshold e h did not reach its value at puberty yet e h e h p finally the adults acquire the ability to reproduce which is when e h e h p and the energy flow formerly allocated to maturity is transferred to a reproduction buffer offsprings that empties in the case of a marina once a year in early autumn during the spawning event 2 2 compilation of data for a marina and parameter estimation 2 2 1 zero variate and uni variate data from the literature zero variate data from the literature an important part of the zero variate dataset found in the literature was composed of data taken from a larval culture performed by farke and berghuis 1979a b before 1990 when the two species a marina and a defodiens were not yet delimited cadman and nelson smith 1993 the lengths at trochophore larva at birth first feeding and at metamorphosis with their associated ages table 5 although the lengths data seem quite accurate plates and pictures the chronology description made by the authors remains vague the precise time line had thus to be estimated from sometimes quite confused date references and we gave a weight of 0 5 to this data in the parameter estimation procedure in the larval culture performed by farke and berghuis 1979a b the temperature varied from 8 to 16 c so a mean temperature of 12 c was used for the data taken from this experiment the second part of the zero variate dataset from the literature was collected after 1990 first the age for the occurrence of the trochophore larva at 10 c was communicated by s gaudron from unpublished in vitro fertilization experiments the maximum observed trunk length good biometric estimate see de cubber et al 2018 was observed by s gaudron on a specimen kept in the animal biology collection of the sorbonne university france finally the age and length at puberty the oocyte diameter and the lifespan were previously acquired by the authors at the same study site de cubber et al 2018 the temperature used for this data was the mean temperature of the seawater over the year 2017 13 c somlit data http somlit db epoc u bordeaux1 fr bottom coastal sampling point at wimereux the age and the trunk length at puberty corresponded to a first mature adult of 2 5 cm and 1 5 years old all the age data estimated from length analysis were given a weight of 0 5 in the parameter estimation procedure considering their potentially low accuracy for all zero variate data the f value was set to 1 considering that only the best individuals were used uni variate data from the literature the uni variate dataset retrieved from the literature consisted in the datasets of two growth experiments one growth experiment in which trunk length was measured at four different temperatures 5 10 15 and 20 c under two different food conditions fed and unfed taken from de wilde and berghuis 1979 8 treatments the corresponding f values were set at f fed 0 8 and f unfed 0 1 in view of growth comparisons made by the authors in the same study one growth experiment in which wet weight was measured at one temperature varying between 16 and 20 c under two different conditions fed and unfed taken from olive et al 2006 2 treatments temperature was set at 19 5 c and the f values were left free for both conditions for these two growth experiments the temperature and feeding conditions met before the start of the experiment were not known so we had to assume the levels of reserve and structure at the beginning of the experiment therefore predictions of growth could only be made considering a physical trunk length tl w 0 at the beginning of the experiment and a physical wet weight w w 0 at the beginning of the experiment equalling to the one of the experiment 2 2 2 laboratory experiments and field data additional reproductive data reproduction rate as a function of trunk length and wet weight of an egg growth data trunk length over time and oxygen consumption data oxygen consumption as a function of wet weight were acquired by the authors in the laboratory and from field observations between 2016 and 2018 in order to complete the dataset collected from the literature study area and sampling strategy lugworms were collected at wimereux n 50 46 14 and e 01 36 38 le touquet n 50 31 07 and e 01 35 42 and fort mahon n 50 20 31 and e 01 34 11 located in the eastern english channel hauts de france france table 2 more details on the sites are given in de cubber et al 2018 for the oxygen consumption experiment exp a the lugworms were collected at wimereux from the high mediolittoral to the high infralittoral part of the foreshore fig 2 in order to collect all the different age groups and sizes de cubber et al 2018 on the sandy beach part using a shovel collection happened three times between may and july 2018 in order to follow the summer increase of the seawater temperature of the english channel table 2 for the reproductive data exp b ripe females of a marina were collected at wimereux le touquet and fort mahon using a shovel or a bait pump decathlon ltd during the spawning period of each year table 2 for the growth experiment exp c young individuals of a marina were collected at wimereux on the high mediolittoral part of the foreshore with a shovel de cubber et al 2018 at the end of may 2018 table 2 see more details in de cubber et al 2018 laboratory measurements after each sampling all lugworms were put in separate containers filled with seawater individuals of a marina were maintained in the laboratory during 24 h at the temperature of the english channel at wimereux at the time of their collection 12 15 and 20 5 c for the oxygen consumption experiment exp a and at 15 c otherwise exp b and c in a cold room to allow gut to be devoided of their content prior to observations watson et al 2000 biometric measurements consisted in total length trunk length more reliable see de cubber et al 2018 de wilde and berghuis 1979 and in wet weight measurements experiment a oxygen consumption the oxygen consumption rates of lugworms were recorded as a proxy of metabolic activity galasso et al 2018 metabolic rates can vary between two fundamental physiological rates one minimal maintenance metabolic rate the standard metabolic rate and one maximum aerobic metabolic rate the active metabolic rate galasso et al 2018 norin and malte 2011 in order to recreate these two situations of activity in the laboratory and avoid any over or underestimation of the metabolic rate the oxygen consumption of lugworms was measured under two different conditions in which their metabolic activity was supposed close to the standard metabolic rate on one hand and close to the active metabolic rate on the other hand in the condition in which lugworms were supposed to experience a standard metabolic rate around 30 of the collected individuals were transferred into eppendorfs or falcon centrifuge tubes 5 ml or 50 ml according to the size of the worms half filled with sand from wimereux burnt at 550 c during 5 h and with twice filtered seawater tfsw 0 45 μm and 0 22 μm enabling the lugworms to burry the sediment was well mixed before the transfer in order to avoid air bubbles inclusions between sediment grains in the condition in which lugworms were supposed to experience an active metabolic rate around 30 of the collected individuals were transferred into centrifuge tubes filled with tfsw only where they were constantly trying to burry no sand blanks were also made for both conditions centrifuge tubes without lugworms lugworms were acclimatized 24 h at the experimental temperature in order to allow them to burrow when possible and relax for each condition centrifuge tubes were oxygenated using an air pump and refilled with oxygenated tfsw when needed at this point lugworms in the active condition experienced regularly extra stress due to water movements the oxygen content was then measured using a microelectrode unisense ox500 coupled to a picoammeter unisense pa 2000 denmark the data acquisition was performed using the software instacal and the tubes were then rapidly hermetically closed with parafilm m for the 50 ml centrifuge tubes measurement was renewed three times every 10 15 min after opening the parafilm m lid for a few seconds and homogenizing the water for the 5 ml tubes only two measurements were made at the beginning of the experiment and after 1 h given the low oxygen consumption observed before every measurement series the whole system was calibrated measurements of 100 and 0 oxygenated tfsw and the salinity of the tfsw used for the experiment was measured using a refractometer the temperature of the cold room was followed throughout the duration of the experiment after the experiment lugworms from the sand condition were sieved out of their tubes and maintained 24 h to allow gut contents to be devoided prior to biometric measurements all lugworms were then measured trunk length and total length and weighed wet weight experiment b reproductive data all oocytes were collected from females that had been previously weighted and measured in a 60 μm sieve rinsed with tfsw and placed in a 5 ml eppendorf tube filled with tfsw table 2 a triplicate of 20 μl of the homogenized solution were then put on a microscope slide and the oocytes were counted under the microscope when fecundity was estimated for each female the supernatant was removed and the eppendorf tubes were weighted with and without oocytes experiment c growth experiment the growth experiment lasted for two months in a controlled room temperature photoperiod at the wimereux marine station university of lille france under a recirculating custom seawater system fig 3 in the custom system one aquarium tray was dedicated to water filtering and two aquaria held the lugworm growing experiment the seawater directly pumped from the sea was kept several days in the filtering aquarium containing fine and coarse filter foam crushed pozzolana and oyster shells and kept in the dark fig 3 10 of the seawater contained in the two growing aquaria was renewed every day or every second day with the water of the filtering aquarium two external filters eheim professional 4 250 and pumps allowed the circulation and additional filtration of the seawater system fig 3a a lightening system consisting in two light ramps alpheus radiometrix 13c1001c mimicking the external light intensity and photoperiod was added to the system fig 3a air pumps air pump 8000 and eheim 400 from europrix ltd not represented in fig 3 linked to home made finely punctured pipes allowed the oxygenation of the system the temperature was kept around 15 c 1 c each of the two growing aquarium trays were holding each twice 3 boxes filled with sediment burnt at 60 c during 24 h and lugworms fig 3b the first 3 boxes closer to the seawater arrival were dedicated to the unfed condition the next 3 to the fed condition a small waterfall between them prevented the seawater and food to circulate in the opposite direction of the main current thus no food could reach the unfed condition the design of the boxes and of the separations prohibited the worms to leave their box and to circulate from one condition to another condition fig 3a and b all lugworms were measured and only individuals ranging from 0 4 cm to 1 6 cm of trunk length were selected twelve batches of 30 individuals were made with the same size trunk length range each batch was placed in a separated box within the experimental set up fig 3b feeding occurred twice at t 0 and t 35 days with yeast wastes obtained from brasserie du pays flamand ltd a local brewery inserted within the sediment with 20 ml syringes between 1 8 and 3 6 1010 cells added per box olive et al 2006 one batch of lugworms of each condition in both aquaria was withdrawn at the beginning of the experiment after 35 days and after 62 days kept 24 h in the cold room and weighted and measured data analyses all data analyses were performed on matlab r2015b for the oxygen consumption experiment exp a for each measurement blanks included the associated percentage of oxygen within the tube was calculated according to eq 2 2 o 2 measured o 2 measured v o 2 min v o 2 max v o 2 min v 100 with o 2 measured v the oxygen measured o 2 min v the oxygen measured for 0 of oxygen and o 2 max v the oxygen measured for 100 of oxygen the oxygen content μ mol l 1 was then calculated according to the temperature t in c salinity s in and the water content of each tube according to aminot and kerouel 2004 see on pp 110 118 the blank effect was deleted and the individual oxygen consumption μmol h 1 was then calculated as the inverse of the slope of the linear regression of the evolution of the oxygen content over time both conditions were analyzed together to consider an average level of activity for the reproduction data acquisition the fecundity f was calculated for each female according to eq 3 with n the mean of the three counts 3 f n 4 10 3 since spawning happens only once a year for a marina the reproduction rate for each female was calculated as the fecundity divided by the number of days in one year and plotted against the female trunk length uni variate data the wet weight of an egg was calculated as the total weight of oocytes divided by fecundity zero variate data 2 2 3 parameters estimation the parameters estimation of the deb models was done using the covariation method described by lika et al 2011 using the dataset shown in table 3 the estimation was completed using the package debtool as described in marques et al 2018 on the software matlab r2015b using both a std deb model and an abj deb model in order to select the best fit model and to compare the parameter obtained with both models the parameter estimation procedures were evaluated by computing the mean relative errors mre varying from 0 when predictions match data exactly to infinity when they do not and the symmetric mean square errors smse varying from 0 when predictions match data exactly to 1 when they do not http www debtheory org 2 3 inferring environmental conditions from biological data and vice versa 2 3 1 functional scaled response associated to growth data the parameters of abj model for a marina best fit model as well as two different growth datasets were used to validate the model and infer the environmental conditions in terms of food levels of these datasets the first growth dataset was taken from beukema and de vlas 1979 it represents seasonal changes in mean individual dry weight 9 year averages in small lugworms from two populations of the wadden sea the second dataset consists of the observations of wet weight and trunk length of the experiment c since the results of the latest experiment seemed to indicate that food was lacking from t 35 days to t 62 days and since no significant difference between the two feeding conditions were observed the abj model applied in this study was used to reconstruct the scaled functional response f as a proxy of food levels during the whole experiment for the two conditions predictions on these different growth experiments were made at one temperature but for feeding conditions varying from f 0 02 to f 1 the best fit predictions were chosen as the ones presenting the smallest sum of squares of the differences between observations and predictions 2 3 2 life cycle chronology under in situ environmental conditions the abj deb model for a marina was used to reconstruct the chronology of the early life stages of the species under the in situ environmental conditions of wimereux eastern english channel hauts de france as well as its growth in wet weight and trunk length and compared them with optimal food and temperature conditions f 1 and t 20 c local environmental conditions the in situ temperature of the year 2017 was taken from somlit as a first approximation the scaled functional response f was guessed from monitoring of the phytoplankton within the eastern english channel lefebvre et al 2011 showing higher abundances in spring and autumn as generally observed in the north atlantic temperate ocean miller and wheeler 2012 fig 11 7 chronology of the early life stages and associated lengths the parameters of the abj model previously estimated were used to predict age and length at trochophore larva stage birth metamorphosis and puberty under the non optimal environmental conditions of wimereux previously defined growth predictions the evolution of the compartments of reserve structure and reproduction buffer from the fertilization to the lifespan a m and further was calculated according to the equations of table 1 for each environmental condition the ages for all the life stages were predicted as previously and a temperature correction was applied when the temperature was different from 20 c the values of e v and e r over time were then converted into wet weight and or physical trunk length with the equations found in table 1 2 4 comparison of the deb parameters of a marina with other lophotrochozoan species the parameters found with the abj deb model for a marina were compared with the ones found with the std model as well as with the parameters of other molluscs and annelid species the parameters collected were taken from the add my pet collection amp marques et al 2018 using the function prtstat of the amptool package used on matlab r2015b all values were given for a reference temperature t ref of 20 c the most complete dataset for molluscs is for the gastropod lymnaea stagnalis completeness 5 the maximum completeness value for annelids in amp is 2 8 and is found in two species of polychaetes and four species of clitellates the least complete dataset for molluscs is for the symbiotic bivalve thyasira cf gouldi completeness 1 5 and the least complete dataset for annelids is for the polychaete capitella teleta completeness 1 5 some of the primary parameters of the two models for a marina were not compared given the lack of data for these parameters e g the searching rate f m the digestion and the reproduction efficiencies κ x and κ r as in kooijman and lika 2014 the acceleration factor s m of a marina was calculated as s m l j l b with l b the structural length at birth and l j the structural length at the end of the metamorphosis and compared with the one of other species for the species showing a metabolic acceleration s m 1 the infinite length l was calculated as l l m s m with l m the maximum structural length l m κ p a m p m the energy conductance after metamorphosis v j and the maximum assimilation rate after metamorphosis p a m j were calculated as v j v b s m and p a m j p a m b s m with v b the energy conductance at birth and p a m b the maximum assimilation rate at birth kooijman 2014 kooijman and lika 2014 all ten parameters as well as the expectations based on the general animal kooijman 2010 table 8 1 were represented as functions of l for all the considered species 3 results 3 1 parameter estimation 3 1 1 parameters of the model the completeness of the models was set at 4 2 following lika et al 2011 according to the dataset used in the parameters estimation table 3 the implementation of the parameter estimation of the std deb model provided a mean relative error mre of 0 30 and symmetric mean square error smse of 0 38 marques et al 2018 the implementation of the parameter estimation of the abj deb model provided a mre of 0 23 and smse of 0 29 in addition to the fact that the abj model provided a better fit to the dataset it appears that the std model largely underestimates the age and length at birth a b and l b the relative errors re are respectively 0 91 and 0 83 as well as the age when then trochophore

variate data the re of the uni variate dataset ranged from 0 06 to 0 41 with the abj deb model and from 0 08 to 0 42 with the std deb model with in both cases the highest values corresponding to the fit to the length weight data collected on individuals of highly variable reserve and reproduction buffer levels and to the oxygen consumption dataset most scattered values figs 4 7 in both cases the oxygen consumption increased with the increase of temperature fig 4 the values of the shape coefficients δ m varied for a priori the same measure of the trunk length between 0 14 and 0 20 with the abj deb model and between 0 09 and 0 13 with the std deb model according to the authors fig 7 which is due to the lack of rigid measurable parts in a marina that could be used as a proxy for length 3 2 reconstruction of environmental conditions with the abj model for a marina from biological data and vice versa 3 2 1 scaled functional response from a field growth dataset the abj model provided a good fit for the field growth data taken from beukema and de vlas 1979 for the two studied sites fig 8 a the values of the scaled functional response f were shown to evolve on both sites during the year with the highest values during spring and late summer periods compared to winter period fig 8a from laboratory growth data overall the abj model provided a good fit for the growth data obtained in the laboratory exp c although growth was slightly underestimated between t 0 and t 35 d and slightly overestimated between t 35 and t 62 d fig 8b the reconstruction of the scaled functional response f provided indications on the fact that the food levels within the sediment between t 35 d and t 62 d might have been really low and did not allow an optimal growth 3 2 2 chronology and growth during the life cycle according to the environmental conditions in situ environmental conditions the seawater temperatures ranged from 5 5 to 20 c at wimereux with the highest temperature between july and september and the lowest temperature between january and february fig 9 a the scaled functional response was supposed to range from 0 3 to 0 95 with higher values in spring and autumn and lower values in summer and winter fig 9b chronology of the first life stages the abj model predicted an age at trochophore larva stage a tr of 10 3 days and an age at birth a b used as an approximation of the age at the first settlement of 15 5 days at wimereux considering the environmental conditions presented in fig 9 table 6 suggesting a first dispersal phase in between these two events of around 5 days the age at the end of metamorphosis a j was predicted to be 208 days a little less than 7 month in local environmental conditions which means around mid april for a spawning period in mid september the age and trunk length at puberty of the lugworms of wimereux a p and tl p were predicted to be respectively 373 2 days and 3 5 cm wet weight and trunk length growth predictions according to the environmental conditions the total wet weight of a marina considering the structure reserve and reproduction buffer compartments predicted by the model at the maximum age a m was around 20 times superior in optimal conditions f 1 and t 20 c around 400 g compared to in situ conditions recorded at wimereux f 0 4 and t 13 c around 20 g fig 10 the total trunk length of a marina predicted by the model was more than twice superior in optimal conditions f 1 and t 20 c around 33 cm than in the environmental conditions recorded at wimereux f 0 4 and t 13 c around 14 cm fig 11 3 3 comparison of the abj deb parameters of a marina with other lophotrochozoan species in annelids and molluscs the maximum assimilation rate p a m increased with the maximum structural length as expected and more markedly after metamorphosis and the associated metabolic acceleration phase fig 12 the values for a marina with the abj model appeared lower than those of most of the other polychaetes and clitellates species before and after metamorphosis except for the values of urechis caupo echiurian species the only other annelid species for which an abj model was applied the value of the maximum assimilation rate after metamorphosis p a m j of a marina with both models was close to the one expected for the generalized animal and followed the tendency found in most of the others mollusc species which was not the case for the other polychaetes species mostly showing higher values the allocation fraction to soma κ was higher for a marina 0 92 than the one expected for the generalized animal 0 8 and did not appear inconsistent with the values of κ calculated in molluscs species fig 12 the energy conductance value v for a marina appeared lower in the abj than in the std model before metamorphosis but the opposite happened after metamorphosis where the abj model s value was higher than the generalized animal but closer to molluscs values the specific somatic maintenance costs values p m of a marina were much lower than those predicted for most of the other species of annelids except for u caupo but were close to the one of the generalized animal and are consistent with the values for the molluscs species fig 12 the value of the costs of structure e g of a marina appeared equal to those of the other annelids and most of the molluscs species fig 12 the value of the maturity maintenance rate coefficient k j of a marina was equal to those of the other annelids and of most of the molluscs species fig 12 the values of the maturity thresholds for birth metamorphosis and puberty e h b e h j and e h p of the abj model for a marina were lower than those of the generalized animal but similar to most of the mollusc species values fig 12 4 discussion in the present study we successfully estimated the parameters of both a std and an abj deb model for the lugworm a marina combining the use of literature experimental and field data we found that the abj model was more appropriate for modelling a marina s energy budget and life cycle and implemented it under field conditions to reconstruct feeding levels as well as a marina s growth and life cycle chronology 4 1 physiological implications of the std and the abj parameter estimation results major differences in the organisms physiology were implied by the parameter results obtained with a faster metabolism for a marina with a std deb model compared to an abj deb model indeed p a m b p a m j p m and v b appeared higher with the std parameter estimation and v j higher with the abj parameter estimation first a higher value of the maximum assimilation rate p a m implies a higher value of the assimilation flux from the same amount of food and a higher value of the energy conductance v implies a larger mobilization flux agüera et al 2015 the reserve capacity e m defined by the ratio e m p a m v montalto et al 2014 was found to be 16 766 j cm 3 with the std parameter estimation compared to 1177 j cm 3 with the abj parameter estimation considering a temperature of 20 c in comparison e m values for accelerating molluscs species were estimated around 4500 j cm 3 and e m values for non accelerating molluscs species were estimated around 11 600 j cm 3 add my pet collection consulted in november 2018 second a higher value of the volume specific maintenance costs p m implies a higher level of energy needed for the same amount of structure acquired the comparison of the parameter estimation of the abj and std models therefore resulted on the one hand with the parameter estimation of the std model in one organism able to store more energy in the reserve compartment but also using more energy for the maintenance of its structure and on the other hand with the parameter estimation of the abj model in one organism able to store less energy in the reserve compartment but using less energy for the maintenance of its structure indeed although the predictions of the std and abj versions of the model were quite similar except for the early life stages predictions they implied really different bioenergetics in two kinds of organisms storing and using energy differently 4 2 implications of using an abj model for a marina in relation with its biology and ecology for a marina the abj model gave better fit results than the std model smaller mre and smse even when only few observations within the dataset accounted for the acceleration period only the zero variate observations a j and l j were added but no uni variate observations made between birth and metamorphosis the presence of a metabolic acceleration between birth and metamorphosis in a marina might be related to its bentho pelagic life cycle indeed accelerating species have longer incubation time before birth than non accelerating species kooijman 2014 kooijman et al 2011 which might be linked to the presence of a larval dispersal phase since a lower metabolism in comparison with a non accelerating species or with juvenile or adult from the same species allows for more dispersal time especially when dispersal rate mainly depends on passive water transport kooijman 2014 this seems in accordance with the presence of a dispersal phase happening before birth for a marina and with the fact that predictions of a tr and a b of the std model presented in this study appeared much smaller than observations compared to predictions made by the abj model in lugworms the gradual change of feeding behaviour between the first feeding at birth the temporary settlement between birth and metamorphosis and the semi permanent settlement after metamorphosis on the foreshores inhabited by adults farke and berghuis 1979a b might be a mechanism of the increase of the metabolic acceleration s m also increasing the resulting specific assimilation rate since p a m j s m p a m b of the individual the increase of the organic matter concentration within the water column during spring spring blooms before the second dispersal phase when metamorphosis is almost completed might also play a role in the increase of the specific assimilation rate increasing the amount of food available for the same feeding effort 4 3 phylogenetic implications of the use of abj deb models for polychaetes the metabolic acceleration rate value for a marina 11 falls in the range of what can be found in mollusc species for more than 95 of the mollusc species 1 s m 27 in the amp database which seems consistent with the fact that polychaetes and molluscs both belong to the lophotrochozoan clade having both a common trochophore larval stage after the embryogenesis however although all annelids are part of the lophotrochozoan clade they do not all share the presence of at least one larval dispersal phase during their life cycle and therefore might not all experience a metabolic acceleration during their life cycle as an example clitellates have a direct development with no larval phase related to their terrestrial habitat and std models might show better fit for these species that may not experience a metabolic acceleration during their life cycle from an evolutionary point of view metabolic acceleration might first have been common to all lophotrochozoans and secondarily lost in clitellate species as suggested by marques et al 2018 for other taxa nevertheless since some species with no larval phase might also experience a metabolic acceleration kooijman 2014 and since metabolic acceleration seem common to a large part of the species belonging to the lophotrochozoan clade kooijman 2014 marques et al 2018 a comparison of the use of both abj and std models for clitellate species should be considered 4 4 energy budget and in situ life cycle predictions the predictions on the chronology of a marina s life cycle stages under the in situ environmental conditions met at wimereux metamorphosis completed at around 7 months in mid april seemed in accordance with observations made by de cubber et al 2018 who spotted the first recruits of the species e g juveniles after metamorphosis in may at the same site this would suggest a second dispersal period of less than one month if lugworms migrate after metamorphosis moreover the age and length at puberty of the lugworms at the wimereux site were predicted with the abj model to be respectively 373 2 days and 3 5 cm which is close to the observations made by de cubber et al 2018 with a length at first spawning after the acquisition of maturity of 3 8 cm and an age of 1 5 2 5 years newell 1948 1949 reported the presence of a marina metatrochophore larvae close to birth and thus close to the first settlement stage with 3 4 setigers and around 0 034 cm of length around 2 3 weeks after the occurrence of the spawning event at whistable uk limit between the english channel and the north sea his observations also seem in accordance with the abj model predictions indeed the age and length at birth predictions at wimereux in october were of 15 5 days and 0 034 cm since temperatures are lower in november in the english channel and even lower in the north sea birth might have been slightly delayed in their study and their observations seem to be in accordance with the abj model implemented in our study observations of post larvae in mucus tubes were commonly made on fucus and pebbles areas until the end of february benham 1893 newell 1948 1949 and up to april in some cases newell 1949 first settlements of juveniles on adult grounds were reported by newell 1948 1949 at the end of april or beginning of may which is in accordance with our model predictions after the age at metamorphosis which is around 5 months old and correspond to a dispersal period after metamorphosis of a maximum of one month the biggest individuals of a marina collected at the studied sites might give indications on the in situ environmental conditions met by the lugworms on these sites indeed at wimereux the heaviest individual collected by the authors between 2015 and 2018 weighted 10 g and the longest one measured 15 2 cm of trunk length data not shown which is in accordance with the length and weight predicted by the abj model for a marina at an age of 5 6 years old age of the last cohort calculated by de cubber et al 2018 for f 0 4 and t 13 c at le touquet eastern english channel de cubber et al 2018 the heaviest individual collected weighted 53 1 g and the longest one measured 20 2 cm of trunk length data no shown and at fort mahon eastern english channel de cubber et al 2018 the heaviest individual collected weighted 26 g and the longest one measured 18 4 cm of trunk length data not shown since no major difference between the seawater temperature at the three different sites exist the main difference was possibly the food availability the comparison of these biometric values with the ones predicted by the abj model around 600 g of maximum wet weight and 35 cm of maximum trunk length for f 1 and t 13 c seems to indicate that f was higher at le touquet and fort mahon compared to wimereux in the different sites of the eastern english channel cited previously de cubber et al 2018 showed that the lugworms recreational harvest in 2017 removed more than 500 000 lugworms and represented a total retail value of around 232 447 euros the need for implementing management measures was also evidenced for at least one beach by these authors knowing the food levels of the different sites might then enable predictions with the abj model on the in situ ages and lengths at puberty which could help managers to implement relevant regulations if needed such as a relevant harvest minimum size limit on the different sites showing highly variable food levels and maximum lengths and weights 4 5 possible future extensions of the model in order to provide the best model possible for a marina further adjustments could be implemented linked to the species life cycle and habitats first defining the temperature tolerance range of the species could improve the abj model by applying better temperature corrections growth experiments from farke and berghuis 1979a b seem to point out a higher boundary of the temperature tolerance range t h around 25 c other studies suggest a lower boundary of the temperature tolerance range t l under 5 c sommer et al 1997 wittmann et al 2008 but no arrhenius temperatures beyond the temperature tolerance t ah and t al range could be calculated yet further experiments on growth or respiration under temperatures beyond the temperature tolerance range could be performed to define t ah and t al and thus improve the temperature correction during their life cycle the different stages of a marina inhabit different marine habitats with different ranges of temperature variation from the metatrochophore to the post larval stage the lugworms inhabit the subtidal area were seawater temperature does not fluctuate that much daily compared to the intertidal areas inhabited by the juveniles and adults where temperature can change dramatically during one day as an example a variation of 15 c was recorded within the sediment at the wimereux site in november 2017 fig 13 in this study the arrhenius temperature was calculated from the oxygen consumption rate of juveniles living on the upper shore we hypothetize that a different arrhenius temperature may exist for the larval and post larval stages living in habitats with a more stable temperature as suggested by kooijman 2010 further experiments could be implemented on larvae in order to record physiological rates and estimate their arrhenius temperature monaco and mcquaid 2018 highlighted the interest of adding to the temperature correction an aerial exposure term m d linked to tidal height and the position of organisms on the shore in foreshore habitats showing wide fluctuations in temperature and desiccation given the intense variations experienced by juvenile and adult lugworms fig 13 it might be interesting to add an aerial exposure term for the species indeed the underestimation of growth by the model compared to our observation of growth of juveniles in the laboratory exp c might be linked to the fact that no tide was simulated and lugworms stayed immersed during all the experiment time without the stress brought by high temperature variations and aerial exposure however it was found that lugworms gradually migrate down the shore while growing de cubber et al 2018 so the aerial exposure correction if implemented should gradually decrease during the life cycle of the organism as well deb models as implemented here enable to reconstruct the growth and the reproduction of a species at the individual level however in order to be used in a population context deb theory can be associated to individual based models ibm in order to explore properties of both individual life history traits and population dynamics bacher and gangnery 2006 martin et al 2012 the association of the abj model developed here and providing predictions on the duration of the larval dispersal phase with biophysical larval dispersal models nicolle et al 2017 could also allow the understanding of the populations connectivity in the area and thus give valuable information for the conservation of the species acknowledgements we would like to thank d menu for his help

24973,arenicola marina is a polychaete lophotrochozoan displaying a complex bentho pelagic life cycle with two larval dispersal phases only partially described up to now a dynamic energy budget deb model was applied to the species in order to reconstruct its life cycle and growth under in situ environmental conditions two types of deb models are usually applied to other lophotrochozoans displaying similar life cycles the standard std model applied to polychaetes 5 entries among the 1524 of the add my pet database on the 18 10 2018 and the abj model which includes an acceleration of metabolism between birth and metamorphosis and which has been applied to most molluscs 77 abj entries out of the 80 mollusc entries enabling better fit predictions for the early life stages the parameter estimation was performed with both models to assess the suitability of an abj model for a marina the zero variate dataset consisted of length and age data at different life cycle stages the lifespan the maximum observed length and the wet weight of an egg the uni variate dataset consisted of two growth experiments from the literature at two food levels and several temperatures laboratory data of oxygen consumption at several temperatures and fecundity for different lengths the predictions of the abj model fitted better to the data smse 0 29 the acceleration coefficient was ca 11 which is similar to mollusc values the field growth curves and the scaled functional responses as a proxy of food levels were suitably reconstructed with the new parameter set the reconstruction of the early life stages chronology according to in situ environmental conditions of a temperate marine ecosystem indicated a first dispersal phase of 5 days followed by a 7 months temporary settlement before a second dispersal phase in spring at the end of metamorphosis we emphasize the need for using abj models for polychaetes in future studies keywords bioenergetics lugworm growth oxygen consumption life history traits dispersal 1 introduction arenicola marina linnaeus 1758 is a marine polychaete lophotrochozoan annelida inhabiting most intertidal soft sediments from the arctic to the mediterranean the species is intensively dug for bait by recreational fishermen blake 1979 de cubber et al 2018 watson et al 2017 and the comparison between harvest efforts and observed populations abundance has evidenced the need for some regulation of this activity in some places de cubber et al 2018 in aquaculture a marina is also reared for bait olive et al 2006 and more recently for its particular haemoglobin that might represent a valuable blood substitute for humans in the future rousselot et al 2006 and which is already used for organs conservation before transplantation however its complex bentho pelagic life cycle with two dispersal phases before recruitment has made the description of the early life stages and their chronology complicated and still little is known about the development of a marina between the trochophore larva stage and the benthic recruitment farke and berghuis 1979a b newell 1948 reise 1985 moreover the literature regarding a marina s life cycle and growth is quite ancient mostly from 1979 and since 1990 it has been found that two cryptic species actually exist and might live in sympatry a marina and a defodiens therefore ancient life history description has to be used with caution cadman and nelson smith 1990 the dynamic energy budget deb theory quantifies the energy allocation to growth and reproduction of an individual during its life cycle according to environmental conditions such as temperature and food availability kooijman 2010 even in species with complex and numerous life stages llandres et al 2015 twelve primary parameters are sufficient for the implementation of a standard std deb model however among the assumptions implied in std deb models some like isomorphism during growth the fact that growth always follows a typical von bertalanffy growth curve or the presence of three life stages embryo juvenile and adult are not found in every species therefore extensions of the std model implying the use of more parameters were created kooijman 2014 accounting for deviations from typical development implied by the std model like foetal development acceleration of metabolism or extra life stages as of october 2018 add my pet amp database estimated deb parameters for 1524 animal species marques et al 2018 among these entries only 11 were annelid species 4 of them being polychaetes species for which std models were applied the closest phylum with a large amount of data is the molluscs phylum over 80 entries also presenting a larval stage indeed annelids and molluscs belong to the lophotrochozoan clade and both after the embryogenesis lead to a trochophore larval stage mostly abj deb models have been applied only for the mollusc phylum which are an extension of std models considering an acceleration of metabolism between birth first feeding and metamorphosis end of the change of shape and are applied to most species with a larval phase kooijman 2014 although polychaete species often present a larval phase during their life cycle until now abj models were not applied to these taxa a std entry for a marina is present in the amp database and enables predictions of the growth and reproduction of the species however more than half of the dataset used for the parameter estimation consists of unpublished data time since birth at puberty and maximum reproduction rate taken from marlin https www marlin ac uk and lifespan and ultimate total length taken from wikipedia https www wikipedia org guessed data wet weight at birth and puberty ultimate wet weight or data related to other species age at birth from a cristata and a brasiliensis amp entry bas kooijman 2015 amp arenicola marina version 12 07 2015 we therefore completed the dataset with literature experimental and field data and implemented a new parameter estimation for the species using both a std and an abj deb models the objectives were 1 to calibrate a deb model for a marina based on a reliable and complete dataset and adapted to its life cycle features and therefore to compare the relevance of the use a std or an abj deb model for this species 2 to make predictions about the chronology of the early life stages of a marina and the growth potential according to the environmental conditions 3 to compare the parameters of the deb models implemented for a marina with the other lophotrochozoan species parameters and discuss the advantages of the use of an abj model for this species 2 material and methods 2 1 the deb theory and its implementation for a marina 2 1 1 the model the deb theory describes the energy flows within an organism between three compartments state variables the reserve e the structure v and the maturity e h or the reproduction buffer offsprings e r according to its life stage in order to describe its energy allocation to growth and reproduction for a given food level and at a reference temperature t ref fig 1 the three differential equations linked to the state

de cubber et al 2018 watson et al 2000 after the external fertilization the embryo develops in the female gallery up to the post embryonic stage the trochophore larva which is able to move vertically in the water column fig 2 farke and berghuis 1979a b at this time the shape is changing from ovoidal oocytes with a shape coefficient δ δ me to cylindrical when the trochophore larva gradually acquires new setiger becoming a metatrochophore larva of shape coefficient δ δ me the metatrochophore larva is released in the water column when it reaches 3 setigers and is transported by currents during several days in lugworms embryos and larvae are lecithotrophic living on maternal reserve and therefore supposed not to be able to feed the maturity threshold e h did not yet reach its value for birth e h e h b where birth is the time when individuals start to feed therefore there is no feeding or assimilation flux during the embryo and larval stage and de dt p c table 1 moreover these young stages do not have enough complexity yet to be able to produce gametes and the reproduction flux goes to maturity table 1 which represents in this case the acquisition of complexity of the individual fig 1 the metatrochophore larva settles and begins eating as post larva when the gut appears functional e h e h b either on mussel beds macroalgae or sheltered soft sediment bottoms fig 2 at this point it lives inside a mucus tube stuck to the bottom and feeds on the particles deposited on the tube and around it as well as on suspended particles farke and berghuis 1979a b newell 1949 reise 1985 reise et al 2001 during this temporary settlement period the post larva continues to gradually acquire new setigers up to the 19 final setigers found in adults the shape coefficient δ keeps on decreasing until it reaches the shape coefficient value of the adults δ m developing a proboscis in the way of the adults farke and berghuis 1979a b newell 1949 these morphological changes are assimilated to metamorphosis up to when the maturity threshold e h reaches its value at metamorphosis e h e h j during this period a metabolic acceleration kooijman 2014 was considered which is supposed to happen in most species that have a larval phase frequently coinciding with morphological metamorphosis marques et al 2018 and resulting in an exponential growth of the organism between the first feeding and the end of metamorphosis from birth e h e h b feeding and assimilation are not null anymore but individuals are not able yet to produce gametes p r 0 when metamorphosis ends a second dispersal phase of unknown period occurs in the water column and the newly juvenile lugworm settles on intertidal areas colonized by adults lugworms where it changes its mode of nutrition becoming psammivorous like the adults beukema and de vlas 1979 fig 2 the shape coefficient value stops changing the growth starts to be isomorphic and follows the von bertalanffy growth curve for a constant scaled functional response kooijman 2010 but it is not yet able to reproduce like the adults since the maturity threshold e h did not reach its value at puberty yet e h e h p finally the adults acquire the ability to reproduce which is when e h e h p and the energy flow formerly allocated to maturity is transferred to a reproduction buffer offsprings that empties in the case of a marina once a year in early autumn during the spawning event 2 2 compilation of data for a marina and parameter estimation 2 2 1 zero variate and uni variate data from the literature zero variate data from the literature an important part of the zero variate dataset found in the literature was composed of data taken from a larval culture performed by farke and berghuis 1979a b before 1990 when the two species a marina and a defodiens were not yet delimited cadman and nelson smith 1993 the lengths at trochophore larva at birth first feeding and at metamorphosis with their associated ages table 5 although the lengths data seem quite accurate plates and pictures the chronology description made by the authors remains vague the precise time line had thus to be estimated from sometimes quite confused date references and we gave a weight of 0 5 to this data in the parameter estimation procedure in the larval culture performed by farke and berghuis 1979a b the temperature varied from 8 to 16 c so a mean temperature of 12 c was used for the data taken from this experiment the second part of the zero variate dataset from the literature was collected after 1990 first the age for the occurrence of the trochophore larva at 10 c was communicated by s gaudron from unpublished in vitro fertilization experiments the maximum observed trunk length good biometric estimate see de cubber et al 2018 was observed by s gaudron on a specimen kept in the animal biology collection of the sorbonne university france finally the age and length at puberty the oocyte diameter and the lifespan were previously acquired by the authors at the same study site de cubber et al 2018 the temperature used for this data was the mean temperature of the seawater over the year 2017 13 c somlit data http somlit db epoc u bordeaux1 fr bottom coastal sampling point at wimereux the age and the trunk length at puberty corresponded to a first mature adult of 2 5 cm and 1 5 years old all the age data estimated from length analysis were given a weight of 0 5 in the parameter estimation procedure considering their potentially low accuracy for all zero variate data the f value was set to 1 considering that only the best individuals were used uni variate data from the literature the uni variate dataset retrieved from the literature consisted in the datasets of two growth experiments one growth experiment in which trunk length was measured at four different temperatures 5 10 15 and 20 c under two different food conditions fed and unfed taken from de wilde and berghuis 1979 8 treatments the corresponding f values were set at f fed 0 8 and f unfed 0 1 in view of growth comparisons made by the authors in the same study one growth experiment in which wet weight was measured at one temperature varying between 16 and 20 c under two different conditions fed and unfed taken from olive et al 2006 2 treatments temperature was set at 19 5 c and the f values were left free for both conditions for these two growth experiments the temperature and feeding conditions met before the start of the experiment were not known so we had to assume the levels of reserve and structure at the beginning of the experiment therefore predictions of growth could only be made considering a physical trunk length tl w 0 at the beginning of the experiment and a physical wet weight w w 0 at the beginning of the experiment equalling to the one of the experiment 2 2 2 laboratory experiments and field data additional reproductive data reproduction rate as a function of trunk length and wet weight of an egg growth data trunk length over time and oxygen consumption data oxygen consumption as a function of wet weight were acquired by the authors in the laboratory and from field observations between 2016 and 2018 in order to complete the dataset collected from the literature study area and sampling strategy lugworms were collected at wimereux n 50 46 14 and e 01 36 38 le touquet n 50 31 07 and e 01 35 42 and fort mahon n 50 20 31 and e 01 34 11 located in the eastern english channel hauts de france france table 2 more details on the sites are given in de cubber et al 2018 for the oxygen consumption experiment exp a the lugworms were collected at wimereux from the high mediolittoral to the high infralittoral part of the foreshore fig 2 in order to collect all the different age groups and sizes de cubber et al 2018 on the sandy beach part using a shovel collection happened three times between may and july 2018 in order to follow the summer increase of the

with a shovel de cubber et al 2018 at the end of may 2018 table 2 see more details in de cubber et al 2018 laboratory measurements after each sampling all lugworms were put in separate containers filled with seawater individuals of a marina were maintained in the laboratory during 24 h at the temperature of the english channel at wimereux at the time of their collection 12 15 and 20 5 c for the oxygen consumption experiment exp a and at 15 c otherwise exp b and c in a cold room to allow gut to be devoided of their content prior to observations watson et al 2000 biometric measurements consisted in total length trunk length more reliable see de cubber et al 2018 de wilde and berghuis 1979 and in wet weight measurements experiment a oxygen consumption the oxygen consumption rates of lugworms were recorded as a proxy of metabolic activity galasso et al 2018 metabolic rates can vary between two fundamental physiological rates one minimal maintenance metabolic rate the standard metabolic rate and one maximum aerobic metabolic rate the active metabolic rate galasso et al 2018 norin and malte 2011 in order to recreate these two situations of activity in the laboratory and avoid any over or underestimation of the metabolic rate the oxygen consumption of lugworms was measured under two different conditions in which their metabolic activity was supposed close to the standard metabolic rate on one hand and close to the active metabolic rate on the other hand in the condition in which lugworms were supposed to experience a standard metabolic rate around 30 of the collected individuals were transferred into eppendorfs or falcon centrifuge tubes 5 ml or 50 ml according to the size of the worms half filled with sand from wimereux burnt at 550 c during 5 h and with twice filtered seawater tfsw 0 45 μm and 0 22 μm enabling the lugworms to burry the sediment was well mixed before the transfer in order to avoid air bubbles inclusions between sediment grains in the condition in which lugworms were supposed to experience an active metabolic rate around 30 of the collected individuals were transferred into centrifuge tubes filled with tfsw only where they were constantly trying to burry no sand blanks were also made for both conditions centrifuge tubes without lugworms lugworms were acclimatized 24 h at the experimental temperature in order to allow them to burrow when possible and relax for each condition centrifuge tubes were oxygenated using an air pump and refilled with oxygenated tfsw when needed at this point lugworms in the active condition experienced regularly extra stress due to water movements the oxygen content was then measured using a microelectrode unisense ox500 coupled to a picoammeter unisense pa 2000 denmark the data acquisition was performed using the software instacal and the tubes were then rapidly hermetically closed with parafilm m for the 50 ml centrifuge tubes measurement was renewed three times every 10 15 min after opening the parafilm m lid for a few seconds and homogenizing the water for the 5 ml tubes only two measurements were made at the beginning of the experiment and after 1 h given the low oxygen consumption observed before every measurement series the whole system was calibrated measurements of 100 and 0 oxygenated tfsw and the salinity of the tfsw used for the experiment was measured using a refractometer the temperature of the cold room was followed throughout the duration of the experiment after the experiment lugworms from the sand condition were sieved out of their tubes and maintained 24 h to allow gut contents to be devoided prior to biometric measurements all lugworms were then measured trunk length and total length and weighed wet weight experiment b reproductive data all oocytes were collected from females that had been previously weighted and measured in a 60 μm sieve rinsed with tfsw and placed in a 5 ml eppendorf tube filled with tfsw table 2 a triplicate of 20 μl of the homogenized solution were then put on a microscope slide and the oocytes were counted under the microscope when fecundity was estimated for each female the supernatant was removed and the eppendorf tubes were weighted with and without oocytes experiment c growth experiment the growth experiment lasted for two months in a controlled room temperature photoperiod at the wimereux marine station university of lille france under a recirculating custom seawater system fig 3 in the custom system one aquarium tray was dedicated to water filtering and two aquaria held the lugworm growing experiment the seawater directly pumped from the sea was kept several days in the filtering aquarium containing fine and coarse filter foam crushed pozzolana and oyster shells and kept in the dark fig 3 10 of the seawater contained in the two growing aquaria was renewed every day or every second day with the water of the filtering aquarium two external filters eheim professional 4 250 and pumps allowed the circulation and additional filtration of the seawater system fig 3a a lightening system consisting in two light ramps alpheus radiometrix 13c1001c mimicking the external light intensity and photoperiod was added to the system fig 3a air pumps air pump 8000 and eheim 400 from europrix ltd not represented in fig 3 linked to home made finely punctured pipes allowed the oxygenation of the system the temperature was kept around 15 c 1 c each of the two growing aquarium trays were holding each twice 3 boxes filled with sediment burnt at 60 c during 24 h and lugworms fig 3b the first 3 boxes closer to the seawater arrival were dedicated to the unfed condition the next 3 to the fed condition a small waterfall between them prevented the seawater and food to circulate in the opposite direction of the main current thus no food could reach the unfed condition the design of the boxes and of the separations prohibited the worms to leave their box and to circulate from one condition to another condition fig 3a and b all lugworms were measured and only individuals ranging from 0 4 cm to 1 6 cm of trunk length were selected twelve batches of 30 individuals were made with the same size trunk length range each batch was placed in a separated box within the experimental set up fig 3b feeding occurred twice at t 0 and t 35 days with yeast wastes obtained from brasserie du pays flamand ltd a local brewery inserted within the sediment with 20 ml syringes between 1 8 and 3 6 1010 cells added per box olive et al 2006 one batch of lugworms of each condition in both aquaria was withdrawn at the beginning of the experiment after 35 days and after 62 days kept 24 h in the cold room and weighted and measured data analyses all data analyses were performed on matlab r2015b for the oxygen consumption experiment exp a for each measurement blanks included the associated percentage of oxygen within the tube was calculated according to eq 2 2 o 2 measured o 2 measured v o 2 min v o 2 max v o 2 min v 100 with o 2 measured v the oxygen measured o 2 min v the oxygen measured for 0 of oxygen and o 2 max v the oxygen measured for 100 of oxygen the oxygen content μ mol l 1 was then calculated according to the temperature t in c salinity s in and the water content of each tube according to aminot and kerouel 2004 see on pp 110 118 the blank effect was deleted and the individual oxygen consumption μmol h 1 was then calculated as the inverse of the slope of the linear regression of the evolution of the oxygen content over time both conditions were analyzed together to consider an average level of activity for the reproduction data acquisition the fecundity f was calculated for each female according to eq 3 with n the mean of the three counts 3 f n 4 10 3 since spawning happens only once a year for a marina the reproduction rate for each female was calculated as the fecundity divided by the number of days in one year and plotted against the female trunk length uni variate data the wet weight of an egg was calculated as the total weight of oocytes divided by fecundity zero variate data 2 2 3 parameters estimation the parameters estimation of the deb models was done using the covariation method described by lika et al 2011 using the dataset shown in table 3 the estimation was completed using the package debtool as described in marques et al 2018 on the software matlab r2015b using both a std deb model and an abj deb model in order to select the best fit model and to compare the parameter obtained with both models the parameter estimation procedures were evaluated by computing the mean relative errors mre varying from 0 when predictions match data exactly to infinity when they do not and the symmetric mean square errors smse varying from 0 when predictions match data exactly to 1 when they do not http www debtheory org 2 3 inferring environmental conditions from biological data and vice versa 2 3 1 functional scaled response associated to growth data the parameters of abj model for a marina best fit model as well as two different growth datasets were used to validate the model and infer the environmental conditions in terms of food levels of these datasets the first growth dataset was taken from beukema and de vlas 1979 it represents seasonal changes in mean individual dry weight 9 year averages in small lugworms from two populations of the wadden sea the second dataset consists of the observations of wet weight and trunk length of the experiment c since the results of the latest experiment seemed to indicate that food was lacking from t 35 days to t 62 days and since no significant difference between the two feeding conditions were observed the abj model applied in this study was used to reconstruct the scaled functional response f as a proxy of food levels during the whole experiment for the two conditions predictions on these different growth experiments were made at one temperature but for feeding conditions varying from f 0 02 to f 1 the best fit predictions were chosen as the ones presenting the smallest sum of squares of the differences between observations and predictions 2 3 2 life cycle chronology under in situ environmental conditions the abj deb model for a marina was used to reconstruct the chronology of the early life stages of the species under the in situ environmental conditions of wimereux eastern english channel hauts de france as well as its growth in wet weight and trunk length and compared them with optimal food and temperature conditions f 1 and t 20 c local environmental conditions the in situ temperature of the year 2017 was taken from somlit as a first approximation the scaled functional response f was guessed from monitoring of the phytoplankton within the eastern english channel lefebvre et al 2011 showing higher abundances in spring and autumn as generally observed in the north atlantic temperate ocean miller and wheeler 2012 fig 11 7 chronology of the early life stages and associated lengths the parameters of the abj model previously estimated were used to predict age and length at trochophore larva stage birth metamorphosis and puberty under the non optimal environmental conditions of wimereux previously defined growth predictions the evolution of the compartments of reserve structure and reproduction buffer from the fertilization to the lifespan a m and further was calculated according to the equations of table 1 for each environmental condition the ages for all the life stages were predicted as previously and a temperature correction was applied when the temperature was different from 20 c the values of e v and e r over time were then converted into wet weight and or physical trunk length with the equations found in table 1 2 4 comparison of the deb parameters of a marina with other lophotrochozoan species the parameters found with the abj deb model for a marina were compared with the ones found with the std model as well as with the parameters of other molluscs and annelid species the parameters collected were taken from the add my pet collection amp marques et al 2018 using the function prtstat of the amptool package used on matlab r2015b all values were given for a reference temperature t ref of 20 c the most complete dataset for molluscs is for the gastropod lymnaea stagnalis completeness 5 the maximum completeness value for annelids in amp is 2 8 and is found in two species of polychaetes and four species of clitellates the least complete dataset for molluscs is for the symbiotic bivalve thyasira cf gouldi completeness 1 5 and the least complete dataset for annelids is for the polychaete capitella teleta completeness 1 5 some of the primary parameters of the two models for a marina were not compared given the lack of data for these parameters e g the searching rate f m the digestion and the reproduction efficiencies κ x and κ r as in kooijman and lika 2014 the acceleration factor s m of a marina was calculated as s m l j l b with l b the structural length at birth and l j the structural length at the end of the metamorphosis and compared with the one of other species for the species showing a metabolic acceleration s m 1 the infinite length l was calculated as l l m s m with l m the maximum structural length l m κ p a m p m the energy conductance after metamorphosis v j and the maximum assimilation rate after metamorphosis p a m j were calculated as v j v b s m and p a m j p a m b s m with v b the energy conductance at birth and p a m b the maximum assimilation rate at birth kooijman 2014 kooijman and lika 2014 all ten parameters as well as the expectations based on the general animal kooijman 2010 table 8 1 were represented as functions of l for all the considered species 3 results 3 1 parameter estimation 3 1 1 parameters of the model the completeness of the models was set at 4 2 following lika et al 2011 according to the dataset used in the parameters estimation table 3 the implementation of the parameter estimation of the std deb model provided a mean relative error mre of 0 30 and symmetric mean square error smse of 0 38 marques et al 2018 the implementation of the parameter estimation of the abj deb model provided a mre of 0 23 and smse of 0 29 in addition to the fact that the abj model provided a better fit to the dataset it appears that the std model largely underestimates the age and length at birth a b and l b the relative errors re are respectively 0 91 and 0 83 as well as the age when then trochophore larva appears a tr re 0 60 for both models the values of the fraction of the metabolized energy allocated to soma κ appeared equal table 4 the specific somatic maintenance rate p m and the maximum assimilation rate at birth p a m b and at metamorphosis p a m j were respectively five twenty and two times higher with the std model than with the abj model however the maturation thresholds for the occurring of the trochophore larva e h tr for birth e h b and for puberty e h p and the energy conductance at metamorphosis v j appeared higher with the abj model that considered a metabolic acceleration rate between birth and metamorphosis s m around 11 table 4 3 1 2 observations vs predictions zero variate data for 9 of the 12 zero variate observations of the estimation procedure with the abj model the predicted values were close to the observed ones re 0 27 table 5 the last three predictions for the age at birth a b the age at puberty a p and the total length at birth l b showed higher relative errors re 0 65 the predictions obtained with the std model estimation procedure were overall less well adjusted to the zero variate observations with 50 of the predictions associated

variate data the re of the uni variate dataset ranged from 0 06 to 0 41 with the abj deb model and from 0 08 to 0 42 with the std deb model with in both cases the highest values corresponding to the fit to the length weight data collected on individuals of highly variable reserve and reproduction buffer levels and to the oxygen consumption dataset most scattered values figs 4 7 in both cases the oxygen consumption increased with the increase of temperature fig 4 the values of the shape coefficients δ m varied for a priori the same measure of the trunk length between 0 14 and 0 20 with the abj deb model and between 0 09 and 0 13 with the std deb model according to the authors fig 7 which is due to the lack of rigid measurable parts in a marina that could be used as a proxy for length 3 2 reconstruction of environmental conditions with the abj model for a marina from biological data and vice versa 3 2 1 scaled functional response from a field growth dataset the abj model provided a good fit for the field growth data taken from beukema and de vlas 1979 for the two studied sites fig 8 a the values of the scaled functional response f were shown to evolve on both sites during the year with the highest values during spring and late summer periods compared to winter period fig 8a from laboratory growth data overall the abj model provided a good fit for the growth data obtained in the laboratory exp c although growth was slightly underestimated between t 0 and t 35 d and slightly overestimated between t 35 and t 62 d fig 8b the reconstruction of the scaled functional response f provided indications on the fact that the food levels within the sediment between t 35 d and t 62 d might have been really low and did not allow an optimal growth 3 2 2 chronology and growth during the life cycle according to the environmental conditions in situ environmental conditions the seawater temperatures ranged from 5 5 to 20 c at wimereux with the highest temperature between july and september and the lowest temperature between january and february fig 9 a the scaled functional response was supposed to range from 0 3 to 0 95 with higher values in spring and autumn and lower values in summer and winter fig 9b chronology of the first life stages the abj model predicted an age at trochophore larva stage a tr of 10 3 days and an age at birth a b used as an approximation of the age at the first settlement of 15 5 days at wimereux considering the environmental conditions presented in fig 9 table 6 suggesting a first dispersal phase in between these two events of around 5 days the age at the end of metamorphosis a j was predicted to be 208 days a little less than 7 month in local environmental conditions which means around mid april for a spawning period in mid september the age and trunk length at puberty of the lugworms of wimereux a p and tl p were predicted to be respectively 373 2 days and 3 5 cm wet weight and trunk length growth predictions according to the environmental conditions the total wet weight of a marina considering the structure reserve and reproduction buffer compartments predicted by the model at the maximum age a m was around 20 times superior in optimal conditions f 1 and t 20 c around 400 g compared to in situ conditions recorded at wimereux f 0 4 and t 13 c around 20 g fig 10 the total trunk length of a marina predicted by the model was more than twice superior in optimal conditions f 1 and t 20 c around 33 cm than in the environmental conditions recorded at wimereux f 0 4 and t 13 c around 14 cm fig 11 3 3 comparison of the abj deb parameters of a marina with other lophotrochozoan species in annelids and molluscs the maximum assimilation rate p a m increased with the maximum structural length as expected and more markedly after metamorphosis and the associated metabolic acceleration phase fig 12 the values for a marina with the abj model appeared lower than those of most of the other polychaetes and clitellates species before and after metamorphosis except for the values of urechis caupo echiurian species the only other annelid species for which an abj model was applied the value of the maximum assimilation rate after metamorphosis p a m j of a marina with both models was close to the one expected for the generalized animal and followed the tendency found in most of the others mollusc species which was not the case for the other polychaetes species mostly showing higher values the allocation fraction to soma κ was higher for a marina 0 92 than the one expected for the generalized animal 0 8 and did not appear inconsistent with the values of κ calculated in molluscs species fig 12 the energy conductance value v for a marina appeared lower in the abj than in the std model before metamorphosis but the opposite happened after metamorphosis where the abj model s value was higher than the generalized animal but closer to molluscs values the specific somatic maintenance costs values p m of a marina were much lower than those predicted for most of the other species of annelids except for u caupo but were close to the one of the generalized animal and are consistent with the values for the molluscs species fig 12 the value of the costs of structure e g of a marina appeared equal to those of the other annelids and most of the molluscs species fig 12 the value of the maturity maintenance rate coefficient k j of a marina was equal to those of the other annelids and of most of the molluscs species fig 12 the values of the maturity thresholds for birth metamorphosis and puberty e h b e h j and e h p of the abj model for a marina were lower than those of the generalized animal but similar to most of the mollusc species values fig 12 4 discussion in the present study we successfully estimated the parameters of both a std and an abj deb model for the lugworm a marina combining the use of literature experimental and field data we found that the abj model was more appropriate for modelling a marina s energy budget and life cycle and implemented it under field conditions to reconstruct feeding levels as well as a marina s growth and life cycle chronology 4 1 physiological implications of the std and the abj parameter estimation results major differences in the organisms physiology were implied by the parameter results obtained with a faster metabolism for a marina with a std deb model compared to an abj deb model indeed p a m b p a m j p m and v b appeared higher with the std parameter estimation and v j higher with the abj parameter estimation first a higher value of the maximum assimilation rate p a m implies a higher value of the assimilation flux from the same amount of food and a higher value of the energy conductance v implies a larger mobilization flux agüera et al 2015 the reserve capacity e m defined by the ratio e m p a m v montalto et al 2014 was found to be 16 766 j cm 3 with the std parameter estimation compared to 1177 j cm 3 with the abj parameter estimation considering a temperature of 20 c in comparison e m values for accelerating molluscs species were estimated around 4500 j cm 3 and e m values for non accelerating molluscs species were estimated around 11 600 j cm 3 add my pet collection consulted in november 2018 second a higher value of the volume specific maintenance costs p m implies a higher level of energy needed for the same amount of structure acquired the comparison of the parameter estimation of the abj and std models therefore resulted on the one hand with the parameter estimation of the std model in one organism able to store more energy in the reserve compartment but also using more energy for the maintenance of its structure and on the other hand with the parameter estimation of the abj model in one organism able to store less energy in the reserve compartment but using less energy for the maintenance of its structure indeed although the predictions of the std and abj versions of the model were quite similar except for the early life stages predictions they implied really different bioenergetics in two kinds of organisms storing and using energy differently 4 2 implications of using an abj model for a marina in relation with its biology and ecology for a marina the abj model gave better fit results than the std model smaller mre and smse even when only few observations within the dataset accounted for the acceleration period only the zero variate observations a j and l j were added but no uni variate observations made between birth and metamorphosis the presence of a metabolic acceleration between birth and metamorphosis in a marina might be related to its bentho pelagic life cycle indeed accelerating species have longer incubation time before birth than non accelerating species kooijman 2014 kooijman et al 2011 which might be linked to the presence of a larval dispersal phase since a lower metabolism in comparison with a non accelerating species or with juvenile or adult from the same species allows for more dispersal time especially when dispersal rate mainly depends on passive water transport kooijman 2014 this seems in accordance with the presence of a dispersal phase happening before birth for a marina and with the fact that predictions of a tr and a b of the std model presented in this study appeared much smaller than observations compared to predictions made by the abj model in lugworms the gradual change of feeding behaviour between the first feeding at birth the temporary settlement between birth and metamorphosis and the semi permanent settlement after metamorphosis on the foreshores inhabited by adults farke and berghuis 1979a b might be a mechanism of the increase of the metabolic acceleration s m also increasing the resulting specific assimilation rate since p a m j s m p a m b of the individual the increase of the organic matter concentration within the water column during spring spring blooms before the second dispersal phase when metamorphosis is almost completed might also play a role in the increase of the specific assimilation rate increasing the amount of food available for the same feeding effort 4 3 phylogenetic implications of the use of abj deb models for polychaetes the metabolic acceleration rate value for a marina 11 falls in the range of what can be found in mollusc species for more than 95 of the mollusc species 1 s m 27 in the amp database which seems consistent with the fact that polychaetes and molluscs both belong to the lophotrochozoan clade having both a common trochophore larval stage after the embryogenesis however although all annelids are part of the lophotrochozoan clade they do not all share the presence of at least one larval dispersal phase during their life cycle and therefore might not all experience a metabolic acceleration during their life cycle as an example clitellates have a direct development with no larval phase related to their terrestrial habitat and std models might show better fit for these species that may not experience a metabolic acceleration during their life cycle from an evolutionary point of view metabolic acceleration might first have been common to all lophotrochozoans and secondarily lost in clitellate species as suggested by marques et al 2018 for other taxa nevertheless since some species with no larval phase might also experience a metabolic acceleration kooijman 2014 and since metabolic acceleration seem common to a large part of the species belonging to the lophotrochozoan clade kooijman 2014 marques et al 2018 a comparison of the use of both abj and std models for clitellate species should be considered 4 4 energy budget and in situ life cycle predictions the predictions on the chronology of a marina s life cycle stages under the in situ environmental conditions met at wimereux metamorphosis completed at around 7 months in mid april seemed in accordance with observations made by de cubber et al 2018 who spotted the first recruits of the species e g juveniles after metamorphosis in may at the same site this would suggest a second dispersal period of less than one month if lugworms migrate after metamorphosis moreover the age and length at puberty of the lugworms at the wimereux site were predicted with the abj model to be respectively 373 2 days and 3 5 cm which is close to the observations made by de cubber et al 2018 with a length at first spawning after the acquisition of maturity of 3 8 cm and an age of 1 5 2 5 years newell 1948 1949 reported the presence of a marina metatrochophore larvae close to birth and thus close to the first settlement stage with 3 4 setigers and around 0 034 cm of length around 2 3 weeks after the occurrence of the spawning event at whistable uk limit between the english channel and the north sea his observations also seem in accordance with the abj model predictions indeed the age and length at birth predictions at wimereux in october were of 15 5 days and 0 034 cm since temperatures are lower in november in the english channel and even lower in the north sea birth might have been slightly delayed in their study and their observations seem to be in accordance with the abj model implemented in our study observations of post larvae in mucus tubes were commonly made on fucus and pebbles areas until the end of february benham 1893 newell 1948 1949 and up to april in some cases newell 1949 first settlements of juveniles on adult grounds were reported by newell 1948 1949 at the end of april or beginning of may which is in accordance with our model predictions after the age at metamorphosis which is around 5 months old and correspond to a dispersal period after metamorphosis of a maximum of one month the biggest individuals of a marina collected at the studied sites might give indications on the in situ environmental conditions met by the lugworms on these sites indeed at wimereux the heaviest individual collected by the authors between 2015 and 2018 weighted 10 g and the longest one measured 15 2 cm of trunk length data not shown which is in accordance with the length and weight predicted by the abj model for a marina at an age of 5 6 years old age of the last cohort calculated by de cubber et al 2018 for f 0 4 and t 13 c at le touquet eastern english channel de cubber et al 2018 the heaviest individual collected weighted 53 1 g and the longest one measured 20 2 cm of trunk length data no shown and at fort mahon eastern english channel de cubber et al 2018 the heaviest individual collected weighted 26 g and the longest one measured 18 4 cm of trunk length data not shown since no major difference between the seawater temperature at the three different sites exist the main difference was possibly the food availability the comparison of these biometric values with the ones predicted by the abj model around 600 g of maximum wet weight and 35 cm of maximum trunk length for f 1 and t 13 c seems to indicate that f was higher at le touquet and fort mahon compared to wimereux in the different sites of the eastern english channel cited previously de cubber et al 2018 showed that the lugworms recreational harvest in 2017 removed more than 500 000 lugworms and represented a total retail value of around 232 447 euros the need for implementing management measures was also evidenced for at least one beach by these authors knowing the food levels of the different sites might then enable predictions with the abj model on the in situ ages and lengths at puberty which could help managers to implement relevant regulations if needed such as a relevant harvest minimum size limit on the different sites showing highly variable food levels and maximum lengths and weights 4 5 possible future extensions of the model in order to provide the best model possible for a marina further adjustments could be implemented linked to the species life cycle and habitats first defining the temperature tolerance range of the species could improve the abj model by applying better temperature corrections growth experiments from farke and berghuis 1979a b seem to point out a higher boundary of the temperature tolerance range t h around 25 c other studies suggest a lower boundary of the temperature tolerance range t l under 5 c sommer et al 1997 wittmann et al 2008 but no arrhenius temperatures beyond the temperature tolerance t ah and t al range could be calculated yet further experiments on growth or respiration under temperatures beyond the temperature tolerance range could be performed to define t ah and t al and thus improve the temperature correction during their life cycle the different stages of a marina inhabit different marine habitats with different ranges of temperature variation from the metatrochophore to the post larval stage the lugworms inhabit the subtidal area were seawater temperature does not fluctuate that much daily compared to the intertidal areas inhabited by the juveniles and adults where temperature can change dramatically during one day as an example a variation of 15 c was recorded within the sediment at the wimereux site in november 2017 fig 13 in this study the arrhenius temperature was calculated from the oxygen consumption rate of juveniles living on the upper shore we hypothetize that a different arrhenius temperature may exist for the larval and post larval stages living in habitats with a more stable temperature as suggested by kooijman 2010 further experiments could be implemented on larvae in order to record physiological rates and estimate their arrhenius temperature monaco and mcquaid 2018 highlighted the interest of adding to the temperature correction an aerial exposure term m d linked to tidal height and the position of organisms on the shore in foreshore habitats showing wide fluctuations in temperature and desiccation given the intense variations experienced by juvenile and adult lugworms fig 13 it might be interesting to add an aerial exposure term for the species indeed the underestimation of growth by the model compared to our observation of growth of juveniles in the laboratory exp c might be linked to the fact that no tide was simulated and lugworms stayed immersed during all the experiment time without the stress brought by high temperature variations and aerial exposure however it was found that lugworms gradually migrate down the shore while growing de cubber et al 2018 so the aerial exposure correction if implemented should gradually decrease during the life cycle of the organism as well deb models as implemented here enable to reconstruct the growth and the reproduction of a species at the individual level however in order to be used in a population context deb theory can be associated to individual based models ibm in order to explore properties of both individual life history traits and population dynamics bacher and gangnery 2006 martin et al

24974,pine plantations very common in the mediterranean basin are recurrently affected by forest pests due to intrinsic characteristics high density low spatial heterogeneity and external factors consistent trend towards a warmer and drier climate instar is an agent based model aiming to simulate the population dynamics of the thaumetopoea pityocampa forest pest the model has been designed using a modular approach several interconnected modules submodels facilitate the incorporation of new knowledge about the pest biology and can serve as template for the design of other similar models the model is spatially and temporally explicit and allows its implementation under different climate and land use scenarios instar is described in detail in this manuscript using the standardized odd overview design concepts and details protocol temperature is known to be one of the main factors modulating the population dynamics of t pityocampa in order to be coherent and structurally realistic instar should faithfully reproduce the effect of this factor on the species phenology this requirement has been assessed here through a consistency test of the submodules responsible for species development this assessment is constituted by a calibration analysis of the pest phenology and a stress test performed by exposing the model to extreme climate inputs as a result of calibration the model successfully reproduces the phenology of the species in the simulated study area moreover the stress test confirmed that the model behaves as expected when exposed to extreme input values the results presented in this manuscript constitute a first internal validation of the development submodels after this instar is ready for a deeper analysis consisting on a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis keywords thaumetopoea pityocampa agent based model abm forest pest population dynamics pattern oriented 1 introduction pine plantations are very common in the mediterranean basin where they were used in the early decades of the 20th century as management tools to halt soil loss in spain alone 2 5 million hectares were planted between 1940 and 1980 ministerio de medio ambiente 2002 currently their intrinsic characteristics mainly low diversity and high stand density together with external factors i e climate change cause pests to be a recurrent problem within these forests forest pests receive great attention due to their relevance in ecosystems functioning and the economic impacts they cause on managed forests see wingfield et al 2015 numerous articles are published every year providing insights on species physiology reporting outbreaks and first records of species and showing up to date occurrences higham et al 2017 valenta et al 2017 zanetti et al 2017 tanase et al 2018 researchers also highlight the potential impacts of forest pests under climate change scenarios which are expected to be more acute in coniferous forests and the boreal biome seidl et al 2017 in this regard current knowledge confirms the lower resistance and thus higher vulnerability of single species forests to disturbances such as forest pests among others fares et al 2015 the lack of integrative and synthetic knowledge makes it difficult to forecast pest behaviour under specific abiotic scenarios and landscape configurations although experiments are possible on a small scale individuals small areas obvious restrictions exist when the goal is to understand the dynamics of large scale systems such as extensive plantations and or long time periods this situation reveals an important drawback when trying to design more effective and feasible management strategies that use up to date knowledge therefore there is a need to generate tools that can help foresters to avoid or minimise pest damage and ensure sustainability among forests masses fares et al 2015 modelling has demonstrated its usefulness when carrying out in silico experiments chowdhury and stauffer 2005 and synthesising information from different scales thus helping with acquiring more comprehensive and holistic knowledge our aim is to improve the general understanding of forest pest dynamics by studying specific cases as suggested by fares et al 2015 thus our approach is to create a model which explicitly simulates the concatenated linkages between the abiotic configuration of the landscape topography climate meteorology etc and the performance of the ecosystem components pine plantations and forest pests in a global change scenario the pine processionary moth thaumetopoea pityocampa is especially suited for modelling purposes for several reasons i the pine processionary moth lifecycle allows for simplification without neglecting crucial processes its characteristic gregarious behaviour allows modelling into groups of individuals that behave as fully functional units which constitutes an advantage in terms of computing power needs nevertheless the lifecycle of this species is influenced by interacting abiotic and biotic factors and therefore modelling such a complex system constitutes an interesting challenge winter temperature and habitat démolin 1969a masutti and battisti 1990 hódar et al 2002 are among the most important abiotic factors influencing these pest dynamics while biotic factors such as parasitism or amount and quality of available pine biomass also play a key role in modulating t pityocampa populations battisti 1988 hódar et al 2002 hódar et al 2004 charbonnier et al 2014 torres muros 2015 ii the pine processionary moth lifecycle is representative of many forest pests long defoliating larval stage followed by pupation and short non feeding moth stage dajoz 2000 netherer and schopf 2010 barbosa et al 2012 thus simulating its population dynamics can serve as inspiration to model the behaviour of other forest pests similar to other species t pityocampa is experiencing an expansion process fostered by the spread of the above mentioned pine plantations in which it feeds as well as climate change hódar and zamora 2004 battisti et al 2005 petrucco toffolo et al 2006 modelling the population dynamics of this species can help in understanding the potential impact of global change on the functioning of pine plantations in the mediterranean area this is of high importance given the extent of such forests and their potential growth decline due to the interaction between defoliation and drought stress linares et al 2014 sangüesa barreda et al 2014 besides modelling the population dynamics of this species will also allow the study of the interaction between pests and land uses therefore helping to improve management strategies in the long term régolini et al 2014 castagneyrol et al 2014b iii the pine processionary moth constitutes a forestry ecological and public health problem nowadays since affected trees reduce their growth and are more sensitive to other pests markalas 1998 kanat et al 2005 arnaldo et al 2010 jacquet et al 2012 it also causes stinging and allergic reactions to humans and animals due to its urticating hairs rebollo et al 2002 vega et al 2003 battisti et al 2017 thus simulating the population dynamics of t pityocampa could help manage its outbreaks to minimise health and ecological impacts some authors have modelled the distribution of t pityocampa by means of equations based models robinet et al 2014 or statistical analysis seixas arnaldo and monteiro torres 2005 régolini et al 2014 most authors interested in this species highlight the importance of climate on the impact of the pest and some have even attempted to model the effects of climate change on it robinet et al 2007 robinet et al 2014 robinet et al 2015 seixas arnaldo et al 2011 however no agent based model abm model is available for t pityocampa in this article a spatial and temporally explicit abm called instar is presented instar has been designed to simulate the population dynamics of t pityocampa this manuscript firstly provides an overview about the ecological background of the target species the structure and functioning of instar are then described in detail according to the odd protocol overview design concepts and details proposed by grimm et al 2010 finally we present a consistency test of the submodules responsible for species development constituted by a calibration analysis of the pest phenology and a stress test exploring the influence of extreme temperatures on the model 2 ecological background of the species t pityocampa is present in the entire mediterranean basin from north africa to the south of europe and from the atlantic coast to the western part of turkey and it is especially present in afforested areas it is a univoltine oligophagous species feeding on pinus sp and more rarely on cedrus sp and planted pseudotsuga sp battisti et al 2015 a complete outline on the biology of thaumetopoea species in general and of t pityocampa in particular can be found in roques 2015 however the detailed features of the t pityocampa cycle widely vary between sites and between years the biological cycle of t pityocampa is shown in fig 1 after mating female moths lay between 150 350 eggs around pine needles or more rarely twigs eggs are exposed to predation and parasitism mainly caused by ooencyrtus pitocampae and baryscapus servadeii parasites are temperature limited and therefore the parasitism rate shows an altitude gradient the higher the altitude the lower the parasitism rate torres muros 2015 hatching occurs in early summer in northern and higher locations and late summer in southern lower ones thus avoiding high temperatures which are lethal for the larvae démolin 1969b seixas arnaldo et al 2011 larvae are mainly characterised by their gregarious behaviour just after hatching larvae build silk nests or colonies as protection against low temperatures and predators since t pityocampa is a poikilothermic species air temperature plays a key role during larval development démolin 1969b huchon and demolin 1970 robinet et al 2007 hoch et al 2009 as well as in later stages moderately high temperatures below 30 c according to démolin 1969b accelerate larval growth while cold temperatures delay development and can cause mortality due to freezing or starvation thus t pityocampa has a higher affinity for trees situated at the edge of the stands or around clear areas since nests there receive more light and therefore are in a more advantageous situation in terms of temperature démolin 1969b moreover larvae colonies can move within the tree to find the most exposed areas of the pines at each moment démolin 1969b hoch et al 2009 pimentel et al 2011 normally larvae feed during the night and digest during the day inside their nests in contrast to other defoliator species the larval phase of t pityocampa takes place during winter therefore increasing winter temperatures due to climate change are expected to favour this species netherer and schopf 2010 battisti et al 2005 larval development requires five larval stages or instars growth and survival of early development stages depend on food quality hódar et al 2002 and higher survival rates are observed for pine trees not affected by defoliation during previous years hódar et al 2004 on the other hand late stages are more limited by the amount of food available démolin 1969b huchon and demolin 1970 hódar et al 2002 robinet et al 2007 hoch et al 2009 full larval development cannot last less than 4 months under optimal conditions for all larval stages it is reported that optimal daily temperature is between 20 25 c and mortality quickly reaches 100 at 32 c démolin 1969b apart from temperature larval survival is also affected by predators barbaro and battisti 2011 and parasites battisti et al 2015 with the incidence of these factors being quite variable among studies when larvae complete their development usually at the end of winter or beginning of spring they constitute the characteristic processions and search for a place to bury fig 1 once the leading larva chooses a suitable spot the whole group buries and pupal development starts pupation success rate depends on shading and parasitism and therefore optimal burial spots are characterised by high radiation and reduced vegetation cover robredo 1963 dulaurent et al 2011 2012 torres muros et al 2017 moths select trees on the edge of the stand when laying their eggs these behaviours generate a characteristic spatial pattern the pest concentrates in low density stands or stand edges and pupae are especially present in clear areas between trees like all other thaumetopoea sp t pityocampa is a univoltine species but pupae can engage in extended diapause in mediterranean environments only 2 5 of pupae show extended diapause i e more than two years torres muros et al 2017 but in other environments the proportion of latent pupal population can be much higher aimi et al 2006 the conditions inducing extended diapause are still uncertain but see salman et al 2019 when pupation process ends moths emerge and live between 1 and 2 days during which time they mate and lay their eggs on a nearby pine zhang and paiva 1998 mating and oviposition in fig 1 3 model description according to gertseva and gertseva 2004 instar can be classified as a homomorphic all components of the model have analogous components in reality but not vice versa time dependent continuous it represents continuous changes of an object over time and deterministic agent based model abm abm has been chosen as the modelling technique since this approach allows an easy integration of multiscale information which is specially abundant in the case of t pityocampa physiological data based on observations of individuals under laboratory conditions hoch et al 2009 berardi et al 2015 influence of environmental factors based on observations of populations and field experiments démolin 1969a samalens and rossi 2011 castagneyrol et al 2014a cayuela et al 2014 linares et al 2014 torres muros et al 2017 and population history based on observations of outbreaks on a regional scale hódar et al 2012 li et al 2015 the following sections describe instar according to the overview design concepts and details odd protocol proposed by grimm et al 2010 which is a very useful tool to characterise abms using a standard structure 3 1 overview 3 1 1 purpose the overarching purpose of instar is to simulate the population dynamics of thaumetopoea pityocampa specifically it simulates the phenology and spatial distribution of the pine processionary moth instar will help us to test whether our current knowledge on the species biology distribution and individuals behaviour explains the population dynamics patterns observed in selected forests thus in the short term it aims to identify caveats and gaps in our knowledge about such dynamics and promote research aiming to fill these gaps the first steps in this process are presented in this study it consists in the construction documentation and initial testing of the model more specifically and following jakeman et al 2006 the context of instar refers to the following topics which help clarify our purpose firstly it addresses questions such as how well can instar simulate the dynamics of the processionary moth forest pest in a spatially and temporally explicit way is it possible to obtain landscape level metrics defoliation rate per year and watershed modelling the behaviour of individual agents is instar able to reproduce natural patterns of the t pityocampa cycle such as density dependent restrictions moreover instar has been designed to satisfy the needs of scientists interested in simulating ecological processes and specifically t pityocampa population dynamics who would find in instar a modular tool to conduct in silico experiments 3 1 2 entities state variables and scales an overview of entities and state variables can be found in table 1 instar contains a simplified version of the biological cycle of t pityocampa represented by three entities egg and larval colonies clusters of pupae and moths the pine trees on which larvae feed are represented by the entity hosts and the environment is constituted by cells each colony represents all surviving individuals from the same egg laying and its stage defines the phase of the lifecycle in which the colony is namely egg larvae 1 l1 representing the first two instars i and ii or larvae 2 l2 representing the last three instars iii iv and v this entity is also defined by the state variables number of individuals i e the number of eggs larvae 1 or larvae 2 contained in the colony days as egg days as l1 and days as l2 days remaining for the stage to be completed and host colonies develop on pine crowns and therefore their location within the environment is described by the host they are linked to except for the host they are linked to all colony variables values change throughout the simulation i e they are dynamic state variables the entity cluster of pupae refers to all individuals from an egg laying that have reached the end of the larval stage and have successfully buried in the soil on a given cell this entity is used to model the development of pupae and is defined by similar state variables as the colonies number of individuals days as pupae and the static variable location finally the entity moth represents an individual moth in the real world it has a static assigned sex and can be mated or not thus in the transformation from cluster of pupae into moths there is an individualisation process which is explained in detail in section 3 3 3 host entity represents trees pinus sp on which the larvae develop hosts are characterised by their static variables location and height as surrogate of tree size which defines its carrying capacity i e how many colonies can feed on it before it gets defoliated moreover they also have the dynamic state variables quantity of available biomass and quality which indicates if the tree was defoliated in the previous season or not t pityocampa is an oligophagous species feeding on different pinus species with variable susceptibility depending on tree species and study site in se spain t pityocampa is found and thrive on p sylvestris p nigra p pinaster and p halepensis as well as some others less frequent species thus we assume that parameters from different host species are straightforward to use on instar and that instar can be applied to any pinus spp affected by t pityocampa nevertheless differences in development according to host species cannot be ignored and surely instar performance can be improved by parameterising the state variables and submodels according to each species see section 3 3 instar works with a 30 m spatial resolution at a temporal resolution of 1 day the world in the model is constituted by cells which represent 30 30 m and have elevation associated as a static variable cells also have dynamic state variables referring to weather conditions which change in every time step 1 day these are the minimum and the maximum temperature moreover cells also have an assigned integrated temperature an internal variable referring to the temperature of a colony which is exposed to the cell air temperature and the number of insolation hours per day according to démolin 1969b this variable is calculated as integrated temperature maximum temperature 1 5 x insolation hours 3 1 3 process overview and scheduling fig 1 depicts a schematic overview of the submodels that take place in each time step as well as the entities which perform them after initialisation see section 3 3 1 every time step consists of environment reading cells minimum and maximum temperature are updated to the current date and integrated temperature is calculated colonies update number of individuals is updated following the colony mortality submodel and stage is updated following the colony development then procession submodel is applied to colonies which have completed their development and will become a cluster of pupae clusters of pupae update number of individuals is updated following the pupae mortality and the length of this phase is adjusted through the pupae development submodel once a cluster completes its development it results in a number of moths moths update moths become mated following the mating submodel and choose a host on which to lay their eggs through the oviposition submodel hosts update the available biomass quantity is updated every day based on growth and larvae consumption through the host development submodel these submodels are explained in detail in section 3 3 3 besides that from the observer perspective in each time step several state variables values are stored for a detailed explanation of how model outputs are structured see details regarding observation in the following section 3 2 design concepts this section explains how some important concepts are implemented in instar these basic concepts describe characteristics of abms that are not common in other modelling approaches describing these concepts in a standard structured format can help transmit the key aspects of the model to others either abm experts or those not familiar with this approach railsback and grimm 2011 the basic principle of instar model is that t pityocampa population dynamics are strongly influenced by the environmental mainly climate conditions and therefore these define the impact of the forest pest the timing of its outbreaks and the areas where it has the highest incidence the spatial distribution of the pest as well as the forest state amount and quality of available biomass emerges from the simulation as a result of an individual s behaviour on the one hand the selection of burial spots and the pines on which moths lay their eggs define the spatial location of the newly created agents and thus their impact on the pines on the other hand timing and scale of the pest outbreaks is regulated through mortality and development literature shows a higher incidence of the pest on areas with low pine density régolini et al 2014 and shifts in phenology due to climate changes hódar and zamora 2004 colonies in stage l2 adapt to increase their success probability by selecting the burial site considering the number of hosts on the cells around them and choosing the one which optimises the probability of survival t pityocampa development is dependent on environmental conditions and adjusts its biological cycle to keep it univoltine démolin 1969b berardi et al 2015 instar implements this by indirect objective seeking constraining the total duration of the biological cycle to one year by shortening and lengthening the colony and cluster of pupae phases depending on the environmental conditions instar entities are able to use information from their surroundings and themselves to define their behaviour i e they sense railsback and grimm 2011 colonies can sense the state variables of their host and the cell where they are located moreover colonies are also able to sense the number of hosts within a certain radius to select a spot where to bury see procession submodel in section 3 3 3 3 similarly to colonies the clusters of pupae can also sense the state variables of the cells where they are since it affects their mortality finally at the end of the cycle female moths can sense if there is a male moth within a certain distance and where the surrounding pines are see mating and oviposition submodels in section 3 3 3 3 no prediction or learning mechanisms are implemented in instar agents interact with each other in an indirect way colonies within the same host compete with each other for their food when the number of colonies on a host equals its carrying capacity the biomass consumption will slowly lead to complete defoliation of the tree and therefore to the death of larvae present on it see colony mortality submodel in section 3 3 3 1 moreover there are intra and intergenerational interactions the intragenerational interaction appears when colonies turn into clusters of pupae and these into moths as development takes place inheriting state variables values the number of individuals of the cluster of pupae is inherited from the number of individuals of the colony it comes from and the number of moths that emerge from the burial site is defined by the number of individuals within the parent cluster of pupae moreover the location of each agent is defined based on the location of its predecessor on the other hand the intergenerational interaction comes from the defoliation of one season defining the quality state of the host in the coming season and thus affecting the probability of survival of the coming generation of larvae to simulate the intrinsic variability of natural processes several stochastic processes are included during instar initialisation assigning quantity to hosts assigning number of individuals to colonies assigning days as egg to colonies and selecting which are the initial infected hosts moreover pseudorandom numbers are also used during the model running to assign moth sex 1 1 ratio decide whether a female moth becomes mated or not once it finds a male moth and choose the hosts where moths lay their eggs following a weighted random selection based on distance to the moth these functions are explained in details in the corresponding submodels descriptions section 3 3 3 the representation of t pityocampa biological cycle in three agent types responds to a necessity to simulate the behaviour and characteristics of each development phase colonies and clusters of pupae are in a way collectives since they represent a group of individuals this assumption does not constitute an oversimplification of the real system considering the characteristic gregarious behaviour of this species where colonies behave as fully functional units démolin 1969b besides defining them as collectives is an advantage since it reduces computing power needs thus allowing the simulation of larger areas to observe the pest dynamics and hosts state instar provides several outputs at system level average hosts quantity percentage of infected pines and number of individuals of t pityocampa at each life stage are stored for each day moreover monthly averages of all these state variables are also stored at cell level this allows the evaluation of the forest pest development over time for a whole landscape unit i e a specific forest a basin etc as well as within the simulated area stand edges distribution and movement of each phase most affected hosts etc 3 3 details abms often require a high number of parameters and detailed information is needed to fully parameterise the model kelly letcher et al 2013 thus as any other abm instar parameterisation requires an exhaustive review of literature as well as testing during last 20 years we produced and recorded data on t pityocampa in sierra nevada and surrounding areas se spain regarding phenology relationship with altitude egg parasitoidism or tree species selection and therefore the model is based on these local data whenever possible when unavailable data were taken from scientific literature elsewhere the parameters used by instar are listed in table 2 and decisions for parameter estimation are fully explained in appendix a in any case instar was built as a customisable model in which parameter values can be changed to fit biological information to local conditions as well as to incorporate new information when it becomes available constituting one of its potential some of instar parameter values are well

matingmax distance flightmax distance tlethal max tlethal min 3 3 1 initialisation instar is initialised by creating cells and hosts and assigning their state variables values for the simulated area elevation host location and height are loaded as input data see section 3 3 2 moth probability of emergence is then calculated for each cell based on number of hosts on it as follows p r o b a b i l i t y o f e m e r g e n c e 0 12 i f h i 3 0 1636 0 0169 h i i f 3 h i 10 0 i f h i 10 where h i is the number of hosts in cell i this function assumes that the number of hosts per cell is a good surrogate of shaded surface which affects soil moisture and temperature these seem to be the main factors explaining the cluster of pupae emergence rate according to torres muros et al 2017 who reported mortality and emergence rates of cluster of pupae based on vegetation cover and soil moisture above 10 hosts per cell full coverage was assumed and therefore cause the probability of emergence to be 0 below 3 hosts per cell no effect on surface coverage was considered and therefore maximum probability of emergence was assigned following data from torres muros et al 2017 a linear relationship was assumed between these two values resulting in the above mentioned function after this quantity and quality values of hosts are assigned the quantity assigned to each host is based on a normal distribution with mean qtmean and standard deviation qtsd therefore allowing the user to setup the initial state of the pine stand quality is defined as defoliated or not defoliated according to a threshold value qlthreshold three extra internal variables are calculated for hosts the carrying capacity cc of each host the number of colonies that a pine can host it is calculated based on observations relating the number of colonies on highly defoliated trees and tree height briefly the number of winter colonies in trees suffering a severe 90 defoliation was related to the height of the tree for 20 pines of a pine plantation near sierra nevada protected area unpublished data from j a hódar see appendix a for details in this way estimate of how many colonies are needed to completely defoliate a tree depending on its size height is obtained cc 11 63 x ln height 4 60 r2 0 65 the daily consumption per colony consumption the relative amount of biomass consumed per day by one colony in l2 stage given the carrying capacity cc of the host on which it is feeding it is calculated by assuming that all colonies consume the same amount of biomass per day regardless of the number of individuals in it it also assumes that colonies feed during the minimum number of days needed for a colony in l2 stage to develop into a cluster of pupae i e 90 days and considering full consumption a defoliation of 90 in agreement with observations used for the carrying capacity calculations which are as follows consumption 90 cc x 90 1 cc and moth suitableness mu of each host which is calculated as mu σ count x coefficient i where i corresponds to the cardinal and intercardinal directions i e north northeast east etc the count is the number of trees in each direction i at a radius of 1 cell 30 m and each coefficient provides a weighting see appendix b for the influence on each direction of the suitableness of a tree for the moth this weighting creates an initial distribution of colonies in which there are more colonies on more exposed trees which is what happens in the real world since burials occur in clear spots and moths choose a host based on the distance to their emergence point afterwards colonies are initialised the number of colonies to be created is defined by the percentage of infected pines which can be set by the user as a model input in this study real data from a defoliation monitoring programme within the andalusia region southern spain are used this programme assigns a defoliation value from 0 no defoliation to 5 complete defoliation to each forest plot at the end of every defoliating season these data are used to define the percentage of infected pines and thus the number of colonies present in the landscape colonies are then distributed among the hosts by weighted random selection based on moth suitableness the higher the moth suitableness the less probability for the host to be infected i e to have colonies on it colonies are initialised as egg stage with days as egg corresponding to a random number between 0 and egg min 3 3 2 input data instar uses a set of input data as follows map of elevation for the simulated area obtained from the andalusian network of environmental information rediam in a raster format and 30 30 m resolution daily maps of meteorological variables maximum and minimum temperature for the simulated area and period these maps are raster files generated by a hydrometeorological model interpolating data from weather stations at 30 30 m resolution herrero et al 2007 see appendix c for more details in this study the meteorological dataset corresponds to years 2008 2013 see section 4 for more details map of the pines present in the simulated forest this map is a vector file derived from airborne laser scanning data which contains the location and height of trees more details about this processing in appendix d all identified trees are considered to be pines i e hosts initial percentage of infested pines in this study this percentage was based on defoliation data from andalusian defoliation monitoring programme this dataset provides an infestation rate based on observed defoliation for each plot within the region on a 0 5 scale the initial percentage of infested pines is calculated based on the defoliation assigned by the monitoring programme to the plot where the simulated area is located this dataset is fully documented by ros candeira et al 2019 3 3 3 submodels instar uses a series of submodels to simulate the development of the pest as well as its interactions with the hosts and the cells fig 1 these submodels make use of best available current knowledge about t pityocampa but have been built in such a way that will allow an easy integration of new information as knowledge on this pest increases as an example if new information on pupae distribution is found the procession submodel could be adjusted to follow such distribution by including a kernel function these submodels can be classified into three types mortality development and movement 3 3 3 1 mortality submodels mortality submodels simulate the death of organisms due to abiotic or biotic conditions since some of instar agents represent groups of organisms some mortality factors apply to the agent as a whole i e they cause the death of a whole colony while others apply to a portion of the individuals that the agent represents i e they cause the reduction in the number of individuals of a colony instar applies mortality submodels to colonies and clusters of pupae while moth mortality is already included in pupae mortality and hosts do not have an associated mortality submodel since t pityocampa rarely causes pine death the submodel colony mortality can reduce the number of individuals of the colonies or kill whole colonies to simulate mortality rates due to different abiotic and biotic factors such mortality rates differ between each stage at the beginning of stage egg when the colony is created a mortality factor due to parasitism is applied mortality is calculated based on torres muros 2015 it considers elevation to be a proxy for egg parasitism and causes the original number of individuals to be reduced as follows number of individualsafter mortality number of individualsoriginal pi where pi eni 1 eni and ni 0 2082 0 0006 elevation where pi is the percentage of individuals which survive at a cell i at stage l1 two mortality factors are applied the first one is related to quality of the host and is applied at the beginning of this stage when eggs become l1 if quality is defoliated number of individuals is reduced by a certain percentage l1mort the second factor is due to lethal temperatures and is applied every day the whole colony dies if maximum temperature is higher than tlethal max or minimum temperature is below tlethal min at stage l2 two mortality factors are also applied every day the first one is related to scarcity of food if quantity of the host is below a certain threshold l2mort threshold number of individuals is reduced by a certain percentage l2mort the second factor is the same as for stage l1 the whole colony dies if maximum temperature is higher than tlethal max or minimum temperature is below tlethal min the submodel pupae mortality affects the variable number of individuals of the cluster of pupae to simulate mortality rates due to shading torres muros et al 2017 which is assumed to be related to the number of hosts on a cell a mortality factor is applied at the beginning of this phase when colonies in stage l2 become a cluster of pupae the state variable probability of emergence defines the percentage of number of individuals which survive and result in the number of moths which are created see pupae development submodel section 3 3 3 2 number of individualsafter mortality number of individualsoriginal probability of emergence no mortality submodel is applied to moth agents since it has been included in the probability of emergence of pupae mortality submodel 3 3 3 2 development submodels development submodels are used to simulate how an organism increases its biomass over time or how it changes to the next stage of its life cycle these submodels are depicted in fig 1 in instar hosts colonies and clusters of pupae have an associated development submodel while a moths development submodel is not required based on the assumption that all moths live one day the submodel hosts development defines how quantity and quality state variables change over time the quantity of a host on a given day is defined as quantity t quantity t 1 consumption growth where consumption daily consumption per colony number of l2 colonies on the host growth npp between april and august and 0 the rest of the year regarding quality this variable is assessed before the growing season starts i e on the 31 st march quality will be defined as defoliated if quantity at that moment is below qlthreshold and not defoliated otherwise the submodel colonies development sets the time that is needed for a colony to change its stage and eventually become a cluster of pupae through procession submodel each colony stage has a counter as state variable days as egg days as l1 and days as l2 respectively which defines the length of each stage in number of days when the counter of each stage reaches 0 the following stage starts from egg to l1 and from l1 to l2 finally colonies in stage l2 will perform the procession submodel when days as l2 become 0 these counters are initially set to the minimum length of each phase based on literature egg min l1 min l2 min but they will be extended under certain conditions if maximum temperature is below tegg devel egg stage will be extended by one day i e instar halts the development of eggs on those days where temperature is lower than the threshold tegg devel if maximum temperature is above tlarvae devel high and the integrated temperature is below tlarvae devel internal l1 stage will be extended by one day moreover if minimum temperature is below tlarvae devel low l1 stage will be further extended by one day same rules apply to l2 stage in other words instar halts larval development when temperatures are not high enough for larvae to digest the biomass they have ingested but in addition also when temperatures a too low for larvae to leave their nests to feed extension in colony stages causes the following pupae phase to decrease in the same length see pupae development submodel section 3 3 3 2 in order to maintain a univoltine cycle as literature refers berardi et al 2015 the submodel pupae development sets the length of the phase cluster of pupae within the lifecycle of the processionary by adjusting the days as pupae state variable similar to colony development submodel days as pupae are decreased by 1 in every time step when it becomes 0 the cluster of pupae disappears and becomes a certain number of moths the number of moths which are then created is defined by number of individuals for the sake of simplicity instar does not consider extended diapause as our study area is located in the mediterranean area where t pityocampa rarely engage in extended diapause see section 2 nevertheless a submodel implementing this phenomenon could be easily integrated 3 3 3 3 movement submodels movement submodels are used to describe processes where an agent selects a place to move to based on information from its surroundings three movement submodels are defined in instar procession which simulates the search for a burial spot performed by colonies in l2 stage mating which simulates the search of a male moth performed by female moths and oviposition which simulates the selection of a host to lay the eggs on i e creation of a new colony and is performed by mated female moths the procession submodel defines the place where colonies at stage l2 and days as l2 equal to 0 become a cluster of pupae agents performing this submodel search among the surrounding cells within processionmax distance and select the ones with the lowest pine density i e number of pines in cell if several cells have the smallest pine density they choose the closest one among them a cluster of pupae is created in that cell and the colony disappears the state variables of the newly created cluster of pupae are inherited from the parent colony number of individuals corresponds to the number of individuals of the parent colony and days as pupae equals pupae max minus the number of days that the parent colony was extended see colony development submodel description the mating submodel defines which moths will become mated and where they will be located after mating female moths become mated with a probability matingprob if there is at least one male moth within matingmax distance when this happens mated moths move halfway towards their partner the submodel oviposition selects the host on which a new colony will be created i e the host to which the new colony will be linked to after mating mated moths choose a host to lay their eggs within flightmax distance weighted random selection is used to define which will be the selected host this selection gives a higher probability of being chosen the closer the host is to the moth if no host is found no colony is created the state variables of the newly created colony are defined as number of individuals corresponds to a random number within a normal distribution with mean csmean and standard deviation cssd stage is egg and days as egg equals egg min the other state variables are set to 0 4 model consistency test instar has been written in netlogo language wilensky 1999 and reviewed in an iterative process by a multidisciplinary team consisting of computer scientists modellers and ecologists an independent implementation of each individual submodel has been used to check that the model agrees with the conceptual model initially proposed by torres muros 2015 or in other words for model verification in the sense of findeisen et al 1978 the last instar stable version can be freely downloaded from github http sl ugr es github instar and run under a netlogo free licence https ccl northwestern edu netlogo besides this a demo execution of instar can be run at https vlab geodab eu a virtual laboratory promoted by ecopotential project https ecopotential project eu 4 1 methodology pattern oriented modelling led instar design and helped to decide which processes should be included in the model as recommended by wiegand et al 2003 the most important pattern regarding pine processionary population dynamics corresponds to phenology which is mainly driven by temperature thus in order to be coherent and structurally realistic instar should faithfully reproduce the effect of this factor on the species phenology the submodels involved in this process are development submodels section 3 3 3 2 and therefore a calibration of the parameters involved in these submodels has been performed besides this a stress test was simulated by defining extreme climate scenarios as input data stress tests often help to identify unexpected behaviours which cannot be detected when the model is run under normal conditions and therefore extreme unrealistic inputs are used in these tests railsback and grimm 2011 these experiments constitute a first internal validation of the development submodels fig 2 since they can help with confirming hypothesis and observing unexpected model behaviours after these tests parameterisation and sensitivity analysis are needed before the model can be fully applied a virtual experimental area was created for this analysis by using a combination of real and built in datasets see appendix e for more details this virtual area is 15 12 cells large covering an area of 450 360 m2 16 2 ha the location is real sierra nevada protected area south eastern spain at an elevation of 1706 34 m a s l and contains 1128 pine trees which have been extracted using an existing lidar dataset see section 3 3 2 finally the climatic data needed to conduct the consistency analysis were generated by wimmed hydrological model see section 3 3 2 and correspond to years 2008 2013 4 1 1 phenology calibration each phase in t pityocampa s life cycle shows a characteristic phenology which shifts each year within certain limits depending on climate conditions thus testing whether instar reproduces a realistic phenology constitute one of the first steps to validate the model in order to test whether the phenology of the model reproduces field observations a calibration of the colonies development submodel was performed the parameters involved in this submodel are the temperature thresholds regulating the length of each phase and the minimum lengths of each stage see table 2 this calibration analysis aims to find the values of the parameters tegg devel tlarvae devel high tlarvae devel low and tlarvae devel internal that best reproduce the species phenology in the study area instar results were calibrated against field observations provided by the sierra nevada global change observatory bollullos and aspizua 2014 the observations consist on a dataset reporting hatching procession and egg laying dates recorded for several plots within the sierra nevada mountain range during years 2009 2010 and 2011 a summary of this dataset can be observed in table 3 calibration was performed following a stepwise approach egg development calibration followed by larvae development calibration in the first step the parameter tegg devel which modulates how long the stage egg takes by adjusting days as egg was calibrated in order to obtain simulated hatching dates within the range of the above mentioned observations for this analysis a systematic execution of the model was performed with values of tegg devel ranging from 15 to 25 c in 1 c steps every simulation was run in triplicate lasted 4 months and was initialised at julian day 210 of the corresponding year 2009 2010 and 2011 for each simulation the hatching date of each colony was recorded and the difference between observed and simulated average hatching date was calculated as a metric of model fit once the parameter tegg devel was calibrated the second step of the calibration took place the parameters tlarvae devel high tlarvae devel low and tlarvae devel internal were calibrated to obtain procession dates within the range of the above mentioned observations these parameters affect how long the stages l1 and l2 take by adjusting days as l1 and days as l2 see section 3 3 3 2 for this analysis a new systematic execution of the model was performed a range of values for each parameter was tested 20 30 c for tlarvae devel high 15 25 c for tlarvae devel internal and 15 to 5 c for tlarvae devel low in 1 c step resulting in 1331 combinations of parameter values simulations were initialised with colonies at stage l1 to avoid noise coming from the previous stage each simulation was started on julian day 226 of the corresponding year and lasted 9 months therefore extending to the beginning of next year thus input datasets correspond to years 2008 2009 2009 2010 and 2010 2011 the initialisation date corresponds to the average hatching date derived from the previous experiment for each combination of parameter values and input dataset five replicates were run finally to avoid noise coming from other submodels mortality submodels based on host quality and quantity were disabled and the procession submodel was unconstrained colonies could bury in all cells around them in this case the procession date of each colony was recorded in each simulation and the difference between observed and simulated average procession date was calculated as a measure of model fit the above described stepwise calibration was based on hatching and procession dates within 1 cycle runs once the involved parameters are calibrated it becomes necessary to test whether the selected parameter values reproduce the phenology pattern over the years to test these criteria instar was run for the period 2008 2011 using the selected values for parameters tegg devel tlarvae devel high tlarvae devel internal and tlarvae devel low 4 1 2 extreme climate stress test by exposing the model to extreme climate we aim to test the model consistency in relation to temperature influence on pest development as mentioned at the beginning of this section extreme unrealistic inputs are used in these tests in order to observe divergent behaviours in the model against normal input data thus three input scenarios were used in this experiment normal corresponding to the daily maps obtained from measured temperatures minus10 and plus10 scenarios minus10 and plus10 were generated by respectively subtracting and adding an offset 10 c to the measured temperatures in order to reach lethal temperatures for the processionary moth and test whether instar simulates development and mortality due to extreme temperatures as expected the offset was applied equally to maximum and minimum temperatures therefore maintaining the thermal range simulations were run in triplicate for the period 2008 2013 considering these scenarios larval development is expected to be accelerated when temperatures are high and delayed when they are low moreover larvae mortality rates are expected to increase even causing pest annihilation due to the higher occurrence of extreme temperatures above or below the species survivability thresholds 4 2 results 4 2 1 phenology calibration results from the egg development calibration can be observed in fig 3 which shows the difference between observed and simulated average hatching date for each year along the tegg devel tested gradient the line indicates the mean of the difference among all three years data from year 2009 show differences of less than 2 days between simulated and observed mean hatching date for tegg devel values 15 22 c data from years 2010 and 2011 show higher differences above 5 days for tegg devel values 15 22 c for tegg devel values 23 25 c the trend changes and all differences range between 3 5 and 7 5 days when the mean difference among all years is analysed small fluctuations are observed the minimum value is found for 4 8 days corresponding to tegg devel equal to 22 c and the maximum value 6 0 days is reached for tegg devel equal to 25 c considering these results the selected value for tegg devel corresponds to 22 c once the egg phase was calibrated larvae development calibration was carried out difference in average procession date between observations and simulations which has been considered as the calibration metric for larvae development phase was calculated for each combination of parameter values and seasons the minimum difference across years corresponds to 2 5 days and is found for tlarvae devel high equal to 27 c tlarvae devel internal equal to 25 c and tlarvae devel low equal to 8 c followed by all other tlarvae devel low tested values except for 5 c data not shown fig 4 shows the mean difference for the three years along the tested values for parameters tlarvae devel high and tlarvae devel intern tlarvae devel low fixed to 8 c a local minimum can also be observed for tlarvae devel high equal to 22 c tlarvae devel intern equal to 23 c this local minimum however is not so clearly observed for data regarding each year separately see fig 11a c in appendix f the influence of parameter tlarvae devel low can be observed in fig 5 differences generally remain below 10 days for all years and parameter values small differences are obtained for year 2008 2009 for most parameter values except for tlarvae devel low equal to 5 c year 2009 2010 shows the highest differences for values below 9 c while year 2010 2011 shows fluctuating differences if the mean across years is considered a consistent increase can be noticed for values 7 c to 5 c as mentioned above the minimum difference is found at 8 c the influence of parameter tlarvae devel low when the local minima of tlarvae devel high equals 22 c tlarvae devel intern equals 23 c can be observed in fig 12 in the appendix f resulting in higher differences for most values and years it should be noted that parameter tlarvae devel low is evaluated only when maximum daily temperature is above tlarvae devel high and or integrated daily temperature is below tlarvae devel intern see section 3 3 3 2 which could explain the seemly erratic behaviour of this parameter once the above described parameters were calibrated results of the simulation regarding species phenology using the selected values for parameters tegg devel tlarvae devel high tlarvae devel internal and tlarvae devel low 22 c 27 c 25 c and 8 c respectively are shown in fig 6 which also shows the observed phenology egg layings fall within the observed ranges for years 2009 and 2011 but tend towards earlier dates for year 2010 in comparison to observations hatchings and processions occur within the observed range for all three years 4 2 2 extreme climate stress test pest dynamics for each scenario are shown in fig 7 as expected high larvae mortality rates resulted in a reduced number of individuals in both minus10 and plus10 scenarios compared to the normal scenario in the minus10 scenario the population was greatly limited fig 7a under the plus10 scenario however larvae mortality due to high temperatures was as high as to cause full annihilation of the pest before the first cycle was completed fig 7b 5 discussion to the best of our knowledge instar is the first abm simulating the population dynamics of the pine processionary moth this is a spatially explicit model which constitutes an advantage in comparison to other published models such as robinet et al 2014 seixas arnaldo and monteiro torres 2005 or régolini et al 2014 the model aims to improve our understanding of the pest s population dynamics and identify gaps in our knowledge the design and implementation of instar constitutes an effort to synthesize the available knowledge about the target species while it allows an easy integration of newly produced knowledge under a structural point of view instar has been built considering all the ontological stages of the target species eggs larvae pupae and moths the concepts of colony and cluster as an agent types are used to represent groups of eggs larvae or pupae while moths are represented as individual agents the model is build following a modular structure with three submodel classes development mortality and movement the classification of submodels into a reduced number of classes helps to overcome some of the most common critics to abms the difficulties of reproducing them standardising their structures and defining guidelines to design calibrate and evaluate them deangelis and grimm 2014 thus the modular structure of instar eases the exchange of information among modellers as well as the comparison between models such a structure improves the understanding of the model and facilitates communication with non modellers moreover it could constitute a framework to build models simulating other forest pests in a wide variety of ecological systems since it summarises the key biological processes that take place in them as an example movement submodels could be adjusted to simulate the dispersal and establishment of mistletoe another common pest in pine plantations by following mellado and zamora 2016 t pityocampa is a poikilotherm species and therefore air temperature plays a key role in its performance moreover the distribution and density of pine plantation stands has been demonstrated to be another important factor explaining the population dynamics of the species dulaurent et al 2011 li et al 2015 torres muros et al 2017 thus instar considers climate and land use as the main forcing variables or drivers in this manuscript the role of temperature in instar has been calibrated and analysed parameters involved in development submodels have been calibrated using phenology observations from sierra nevada spain and the difference between observed and simulated average hatching and procession date as a measure of model fit the egg phase showed small differences maximum 9 days for all tested parameter values and years the parameter value selected corresponds to the one which minimises the difference in observed and simulated average hatching date for all three years tegg devel 22 c larvae phase shows important differences for different parameter values and years this implies that larvae phase is the main responsible for the phenology within instar the parameter set selected for larvae development corresponds to the one which minimises the difference for all years tlarvae devel high 27 c tlarvae devel intern 25 c and tlarvae devel low 8 c this set also resulted in small differences for each year separately and causes the model to successfully reproduce the species phenology through a multiple year simulation besides this instar behaviour when exposed to extreme climate has also been analysed extremely low temperatures minus10 scenario have a severe impact on the number of larvae but not on the eggs this is explained by the fact that the egg mortality implemented in the model is only due to parasitism which is not linked with temperature the model could be improved in this regard by also including egg mortality due to lethal temperature following rocha et al 2017 and the effect of temperature on parasitism rates following tiberi et al 2015 when exposed to extremely high temperatures plus10 scenario the behaviour is quite different this scenario causes a total annihilation of the pest during the first year of the execution in other words an extreme increase in temperature such as the one caused by plus10 scenario seem to cause most cells in the landscape to reach maximum lethal temperatures our simulated area represents a warm region of the distribution area of the pest therefore the population is probably closer to its high temperature threshold than to its lower one resulting in this scenario causing the population collapse which cannot be observed under the minus10 scenario i e a change of the same scale towards low temperatures does not cause as many cells to reach minimum lethal temperatures nevertheless these statements should be taken cautiously the parameter values have been taken from literature they refer to air temperatures and represent the general knowledge of t pityocampa the actual lethal values may differ for different populations and been influenced by other factors e g wind speed shading which can modulate the actual temperature to which larvae are exposed another reason for the difference between scenarios can be that at higher temperatures eggs develop faster and hatching is anticipated causing the larvae to be exposed to the high summer temperatures literature suggests that t pityocampa adapts to areas with warm summers by delaying the egg phase to late summer thus avoiding lethal temperatures chapter 2 in roques 2015 at the moment instar does not possess a mechanism simulating this process since initialisation is fixed at a certain date as it is commonly done in processes which deal with seasonal and annual patterns such as hydrological models this limitation however can be overcome by calibrating the initialisation date for the area to be simulated based on field data to sum up phenology has been calibrated successfully according to the field observations however more knowledge about the drivers modulating the biological cycle of the species would be required for a more realistic modelling this article is focused on the phenological aspects of the processionary moth although this is a very important process in order to correctly simulate the population dynamics of the pest its spatial distribution should be addressed by calibrating and parameterising movement submodels however data on movements by the pine processionary moth are difficult to obtain and literature often refers to non natural conditions such as flight distance measured under laboratory conditions sauvard and yart in battisti et al 2015 or extreme values robredo 1963 moreover assessing the impact of the pest at a landscape scale requires high resolution data such as quantifying per larvae biomass consumption although larvae weight gain has been studied avtzis 1986 no reference for biomass consumption has been found this has avoided a more realistic modelisation of the host pest interaction due to the interest on forest health pests are commonly monitored by assessing their impact as defoliation or other stress signals on the host trumbore et al 2015 in the case of the pine processionary moth the number of colonies is also often monitored and reported instar uses this type of information for the calculation of the trees carrying capacity see section 3 3 1 and appendix a however data at a higher resolution i e number of larvae per colony at different stages is not available and such information would be particularly valuable to improve how the host pest interaction is modelled and to calibrate the mortality submodels in general terms information and field observations about movement and mortality parameters are scarce and therefore an important gap of knowledge exists in this respect instar is focused on the processionary moth and therefore host development is modelled in a very simple way this submodel could be further improved by considering more a complex relationship of pine activity with climate differences among pine species or linkages between primary production and topographic soil features this could be done by coupling instar with independent models such as the ones proposed by faias et al 2012 simulating stand growth and development due to the inherent characteristics of abms there is a high degree of uncertainty in the model and a high number of parameters which will require calibration and parameterisation kelly letcher et al 2013 thus further work should focus on determining the parameters which have the strongest impact on model outputs i e sensitivity analysis and identifying model uncertainty sources once the model is fully calibrated and validated simulations can be considered as in silico performed experiments that are not feasible in the real world instar could then help to forecast the probability of occurrence and intensity of the pest outbreaks on pine plantations under different climate and land use scenarios thus in the long term instar could be useful for the environmental decision makers in charge of managing the large area covered by pine plantations affected by this pest 6 conclusions current available knowledge on t pityocampa has been synthesized and integrated into instar an abm aiming to simulate the population dynamics of this species in this article we present instar model structure according to a standard protocol specifically designed to document abms increasing its usability and reproducibility moreover we have conducted a consistency test which constitutes a first internal validation of the model the experiments presented here assess how the model simulates the development of the pest driven by temperature once the model has been calibrated it successfully reproduces the phenology observed for a given area this means that the submodels responsible for the development within instar are well designed and implemented moreover the model behaves as expected when exposed to extreme input values through a climate stress test extreme high temperatures cause full annihilation of the pest before the first cycle is completed and extreme low temperatures greatly limit the pest population further work should focus on testing and calibration of pest spatial distribution as well as overall sensitivity and uncertainty analysis author contributions maría suárez muñoz leaded the manuscript writing process as

24974,pine plantations very common in the mediterranean basin are recurrently affected by forest pests due to intrinsic characteristics high density low spatial heterogeneity and external factors consistent trend towards a warmer and drier climate instar is an agent based model aiming to simulate the population dynamics of the thaumetopoea pityocampa forest pest the model has been designed using a modular approach several interconnected modules submodels facilitate the incorporation of new knowledge about the pest biology and can serve as template for the design of other similar models the model is spatially and temporally explicit and allows its implementation under different climate and land use scenarios instar is described in detail in this manuscript using the standardized odd overview design concepts and details protocol temperature is known to be one of the main factors modulating the population dynamics of t pityocampa in order to be coherent and structurally realistic instar should faithfully reproduce the effect of this factor on the species phenology this requirement has been assessed here through a consistency test of the submodules responsible for species development this assessment is constituted by a calibration analysis of the pest phenology and a stress test performed by exposing the model to extreme climate inputs as a result of calibration the model successfully reproduces the phenology of the species in the simulated study area moreover the stress test confirmed that the model behaves as expected when exposed to extreme input values the results presented in this manuscript constitute a first internal validation of the development submodels after this instar is ready for a deeper analysis consisting on a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis keywords thaumetopoea pityocampa agent based model abm forest pest population dynamics pattern oriented 1 introduction pine plantations are very common in the mediterranean basin where they were used in the early decades of the 20th century as management tools to halt soil loss in spain alone 2 5 million hectares were planted between 1940 and 1980 ministerio de medio ambiente 2002 currently their intrinsic characteristics mainly low diversity and high stand density together with external factors i e climate change cause pests to be a recurrent problem within these forests forest pests receive great attention due to their relevance in ecosystems functioning and the economic impacts they cause on managed forests see wingfield et al 2015 numerous articles are published every year providing insights on species physiology reporting outbreaks and first records of species and showing up to date occurrences higham et al 2017 valenta et al 2017 zanetti et al 2017 tanase et al 2018 researchers also highlight the potential impacts of forest pests under climate change scenarios which are expected to be more acute in coniferous forests and the boreal biome seidl et al 2017 in this regard current knowledge confirms the lower resistance and thus higher vulnerability of single species forests to disturbances such as forest pests among others fares et al 2015 the lack of integrative and synthetic knowledge makes it difficult to forecast pest behaviour under specific abiotic scenarios and landscape configurations although experiments are possible on a small scale individuals small areas obvious restrictions exist when the goal is to understand the dynamics of large scale systems such as extensive plantations and or long time periods this situation reveals an important drawback when trying to design more effective and feasible management strategies that use up to date knowledge therefore there is a need to generate tools that can help foresters to avoid or minimise pest damage and ensure sustainability among forests masses fares et al 2015 modelling has demonstrated its usefulness when carrying out in silico experiments chowdhury and stauffer 2005 and synthesising information from different scales thus helping with acquiring more comprehensive and holistic knowledge our aim is to improve the general understanding of forest pest dynamics by studying specific cases as suggested by fares et al 2015 thus our approach is to create a model which explicitly simulates the concatenated linkages between the abiotic configuration of the landscape topography climate meteorology etc and the performance of the ecosystem components pine plantations and forest pests in a global change scenario the pine processionary moth thaumetopoea pityocampa is especially suited for modelling purposes for several reasons i the pine processionary moth lifecycle allows for simplification without neglecting crucial processes its characteristic gregarious behaviour allows modelling into groups of individuals that behave as fully functional units which constitutes an advantage in terms of computing power needs nevertheless the lifecycle of this species is influenced by interacting abiotic and biotic factors and therefore modelling such a complex system constitutes an interesting challenge winter temperature and habitat démolin 1969a masutti and battisti 1990 hódar et al 2002 are among the most important abiotic factors influencing these pest dynamics while biotic factors such as parasitism or amount and quality of available pine biomass also play a key role in modulating t pityocampa populations battisti 1988 hódar et al 2002 hódar et al 2004 charbonnier et al 2014 torres muros 2015 ii the pine processionary moth lifecycle is representative of many forest pests long defoliating larval stage followed by pupation and short non feeding moth stage dajoz 2000 netherer and schopf 2010 barbosa et al 2012 thus simulating its population dynamics can serve as inspiration to model the behaviour of other forest pests similar to other species t pityocampa is experiencing an expansion process fostered by the spread of the above mentioned pine plantations in which it feeds as well as climate change hódar and zamora 2004 battisti et al 2005 petrucco toffolo et al 2006 modelling the population dynamics of this species can help in understanding the potential impact of global change on the functioning of pine plantations in the mediterranean area this is of high importance given the extent of such forests and their potential growth decline due to the interaction between defoliation and drought stress linares et al 2014 sangüesa barreda et al 2014 besides modelling the population dynamics of this species will also allow the study of the interaction between pests and land uses therefore helping to improve management strategies in the long term régolini et al 2014 castagneyrol et al 2014b iii the pine processionary moth constitutes a forestry ecological and public health problem nowadays since affected trees reduce their growth and are more sensitive to other pests markalas 1998 kanat et al 2005 arnaldo et al 2010 jacquet et al 2012 it also causes stinging and allergic reactions to humans and animals due to its urticating hairs rebollo et al 2002 vega et al 2003 battisti et al 2017 thus simulating the population dynamics of t pityocampa could help manage its outbreaks to minimise health and ecological impacts some authors have modelled the distribution of t pityocampa by means of equations based models robinet et al 2014 or statistical analysis seixas arnaldo and monteiro torres 2005 régolini et al 2014 most authors interested in this species highlight the importance of climate on the impact of the pest and some have even attempted to model the effects of climate change on it robinet et al 2007 robinet et al 2014 robinet et al 2015 seixas arnaldo et al 2011 however no agent based model abm model is available for t pityocampa in this article a spatial and temporally explicit abm called instar is presented instar has been designed to simulate the population dynamics of t pityocampa this manuscript firstly provides an overview about the ecological background of the target species the structure and functioning of instar are then described in detail according to the odd protocol overview design concepts and details proposed by grimm et al 2010 finally we present a consistency test of the submodules responsible for species development constituted by a calibration analysis of the pest phenology and a stress test exploring the influence of extreme temperatures on the model 2 ecological background of the species t pityocampa is present in the entire mediterranean basin from north africa to the south of europe and from the atlantic coast to the western part of turkey and it is especially present in afforested areas it is a univoltine oligophagous species feeding on pinus sp and more rarely on cedrus sp and planted pseudotsuga sp battisti et al 2015 a complete outline on the biology of thaumetopoea species in general and of t pityocampa in particular can be found in roques 2015 however the detailed features of the t pityocampa cycle widely vary between sites and between years the biological cycle of t pityocampa is shown in fig 1 after mating female moths lay between 150 350 eggs around pine needles or more rarely twigs eggs are exposed to predation and parasitism mainly caused by ooencyrtus pitocampae and baryscapus servadeii parasites are temperature limited and therefore the parasitism rate shows an altitude gradient the higher the altitude the lower the parasitism rate torres muros 2015 hatching occurs in early summer in northern and higher locations and late summer in southern lower ones thus avoiding high temperatures which are lethal for the larvae démolin 1969b seixas arnaldo et al 2011 larvae are mainly characterised by their gregarious behaviour just after hatching larvae build silk nests or colonies as protection against low temperatures and predators since t pityocampa is a poikilothermic species air temperature plays a key role during larval development démolin 1969b huchon and demolin 1970 robinet et al 2007 hoch et al 2009 as well as in later stages moderately high temperatures below 30 c according to démolin 1969b accelerate larval growth while cold temperatures delay development and can cause mortality due to freezing or starvation thus t pityocampa has a higher affinity for trees situated at the edge of the stands or around clear areas since nests there receive more light and therefore are in a more advantageous situation in terms of temperature démolin 1969b moreover larvae colonies can move within the tree to find the most exposed areas of the pines at each moment démolin 1969b hoch et al 2009 pimentel et al 2011 normally larvae feed during the night and digest during the day inside their nests in contrast to other defoliator species the larval phase of t pityocampa takes place during winter therefore increasing winter temperatures due to climate change are expected to favour this species netherer and schopf 2010 battisti et al 2005 larval development requires five larval stages or instars growth and survival of early development stages depend on food quality hódar et al 2002 and higher survival rates are observed for pine trees not affected by defoliation during previous years hódar et al 2004 on the other hand late stages are more limited by the amount of food available démolin 1969b huchon and demolin 1970 hódar et al 2002 robinet et al 2007 hoch et al 2009 full larval development cannot last less than 4 months under optimal conditions for all larval stages it is reported that optimal daily temperature is between 20 25 c and mortality quickly reaches 100 at 32 c démolin 1969b apart from temperature larval survival is also affected by predators barbaro and battisti 2011 and parasites battisti et al 2015 with the incidence of these factors being quite variable among studies when larvae complete their development usually at the end of winter or beginning of spring they constitute the characteristic processions and search for a place to bury fig 1 once the leading larva chooses a suitable spot the whole group buries and pupal development starts pupation success rate depends on shading and parasitism and therefore optimal burial spots are characterised by high radiation and reduced vegetation cover robredo 1963 dulaurent et al 2011 2012 torres muros et al 2017 moths select trees on the edge of the stand when laying their eggs these behaviours generate a characteristic spatial pattern the pest concentrates in low density stands or stand edges and pupae are especially present in clear areas between trees like all other thaumetopoea sp t pityocampa is a univoltine species but pupae can engage in extended diapause in mediterranean environments only 2 5 of pupae show extended diapause i e more than two years torres muros et al 2017 but in other environments the proportion of latent pupal population can be much higher aimi et al 2006 the conditions inducing extended diapause are still uncertain but see salman et al 2019 when pupation process ends moths emerge and live between 1 and 2 days during which time they mate and lay their eggs on a nearby pine zhang and paiva 1998 mating and oviposition in fig 1 3 model description according to gertseva and gertseva 2004 instar can be classified as a homomorphic all components of the model have analogous components in reality but not vice versa time dependent continuous it represents continuous changes of an object over time and deterministic agent based model abm abm has been chosen as the modelling technique since this approach allows an easy integration of multiscale information which is specially abundant in the case of t pityocampa physiological data based on observations of individuals under laboratory conditions hoch et al 2009 berardi et al 2015 influence of environmental factors based on observations of populations and field experiments démolin 1969a samalens and rossi 2011 castagneyrol et al 2014a cayuela et al 2014 linares et al 2014 torres muros et al 2017 and population history based on observations of outbreaks on a regional scale hódar et al 2012 li et al 2015 the following sections describe instar according to the overview design concepts and details odd protocol proposed by grimm et al 2010 which is a very useful tool to characterise abms using a standard structure 3 1 overview 3 1 1 purpose the overarching purpose of instar is to simulate the population dynamics of thaumetopoea pityocampa specifically it simulates the phenology and spatial distribution of the pine processionary moth instar will help us to test whether our current knowledge on the species biology distribution and individuals behaviour explains the population dynamics patterns observed in selected forests thus in the short term it aims to identify caveats and gaps in our knowledge about such dynamics and promote research aiming to fill these gaps the first steps in this process are presented in this study it consists in the construction documentation and initial testing of the model more specifically and following jakeman et al 2006 the context of instar refers to the following topics which help clarify our purpose firstly it addresses questions such as how well can instar simulate the dynamics of the processionary moth forest pest in a spatially and temporally explicit way is it possible to obtain landscape level metrics defoliation rate per year and watershed modelling the behaviour of individual agents is instar able to reproduce natural patterns of the t pityocampa cycle such as density dependent restrictions moreover instar has been designed to satisfy the needs of scientists interested in simulating ecological processes and specifically t pityocampa population dynamics who would find in instar a modular tool to conduct in silico experiments 3 1 2 entities state variables and scales an overview of entities and state variables can be found in table 1 instar contains a simplified version of the biological cycle of t pityocampa represented by three entities egg and larval colonies clusters of pupae and moths the pine trees on which larvae feed are represented by the entity hosts and the environment is constituted by cells each colony represents all surviving individuals from the same egg laying and its stage defines the phase of the lifecycle in which the colony is namely egg larvae 1 l1 representing the first two instars i and ii or larvae 2 l2 representing the last three instars iii iv and v this entity is also defined by the state variables number of individuals i e the number of eggs larvae 1 or larvae 2 contained in the colony days as egg days as l1 and days as l2 days remaining for the stage to be completed and host colonies develop on pine crowns and therefore their location within the environment is described by the host they are linked to except for the host they are linked to all colony variables values change throughout the simulation i e they are dynamic state variables the entity cluster of pupae refers to all individuals from an egg laying that have reached the end of the larval stage and have successfully buried in the soil on a given cell this entity is used to model the development of pupae and is defined by similar state variables as the colonies number of individuals days as pupae and the static variable location finally the entity moth represents an individual moth in the real world it has a static assigned sex and can be mated or not thus in the transformation from cluster of pupae into moths there is an individualisation process which is explained in detail in section 3 3 3 host entity represents trees pinus sp on which the larvae develop hosts are characterised by their static variables location and height as surrogate of tree size which defines its carrying capacity i e how many colonies can feed on it before it gets defoliated moreover they also have the dynamic state variables quantity of available biomass and quality which indicates if the tree was defoliated in the previous season or not t pityocampa is an oligophagous species feeding on different pinus species with variable susceptibility depending on tree species and study site in se spain t pityocampa is found and thrive on p sylvestris p nigra p pinaster and p halepensis as well as some others less frequent species thus we assume that parameters from different host species are straightforward to use on instar and that instar can be applied to any pinus spp affected by t pityocampa nevertheless differences in development according to host species cannot be ignored and surely instar performance can be improved by parameterising the state variables and submodels according to each species see section 3 3 instar works with a 30 m spatial resolution at a temporal resolution of 1 day the world in the model is constituted by cells which represent 30 30 m and have elevation associated as a static variable cells also have dynamic state variables referring to weather conditions which change in every time step 1 day these are the minimum and the maximum temperature moreover cells also have an assigned integrated temperature an internal variable referring to the temperature of a colony which is exposed to the cell air temperature and the number of insolation hours per day according to démolin 1969b this variable is calculated as integrated temperature maximum temperature 1 5 x insolation hours 3 1 3 process overview and scheduling fig 1 depicts a schematic overview of the submodels that take place in each time step as well as the entities which perform them after initialisation see section 3 3 1 every time step consists of environment reading cells minimum and maximum temperature are updated to the current date and integrated temperature is calculated colonies update number of individuals is updated following the colony mortality submodel and stage is updated following the colony development then procession submodel is applied to colonies which have completed their development and will become a cluster of pupae clusters of pupae update number of individuals is updated following the pupae mortality and the length of this phase is adjusted through the pupae development submodel once a cluster completes its development it results in a number of moths moths update moths become mated following the mating submodel and choose a host on which to lay their eggs through the oviposition submodel hosts update the available biomass quantity is updated every day based on growth and larvae consumption through the host development submodel these submodels are explained in detail in section 3 3 3 besides that from the observer perspective in each time step several state variables values are stored for a detailed explanation of how model outputs are structured see details regarding observation in the following section 3 2 design concepts this section explains how some important concepts are implemented in instar these basic concepts describe characteristics of abms that are not common in other modelling approaches describing these concepts in a standard structured format can help transmit the key aspects of the model to others either abm experts or those not familiar with this approach railsback and grimm 2011 the basic principle of instar model is that t pityocampa population dynamics are strongly influenced by the environmental mainly climate conditions and therefore these define the impact of the forest pest the timing of its outbreaks and the areas where it has the highest incidence the spatial distribution of the pest as well as the forest state amount and quality of available biomass emerges from the simulation as a result of an individual s behaviour on the one hand the selection of burial spots and the pines on which moths lay their eggs define the spatial location of the newly created agents and thus their impact on the pines on the other hand timing and scale of the pest outbreaks is regulated through mortality and development literature shows a higher incidence of the pest on areas with low pine density régolini et al 2014 and shifts in phenology due to climate changes hódar and zamora 2004 colonies in stage l2 adapt to increase their success probability by selecting the burial site considering the number of hosts on the cells around them and choosing the one which optimises the probability of survival t pityocampa development is dependent on environmental conditions and adjusts its biological cycle to keep it univoltine démolin 1969b berardi et al 2015 instar implements this by indirect objective seeking constraining the total duration of the biological cycle to one year by shortening and lengthening the colony and cluster of pupae phases depending on the environmental conditions instar entities are able to use information from their surroundings and themselves to define their behaviour i e they sense railsback and grimm 2011 colonies can sense the state variables of their host and the cell where they are located moreover colonies are also able to sense the number of hosts within a certain radius to select a spot where to bury see procession submodel in section 3 3 3 3 similarly to colonies the clusters of pupae can also sense the state variables of the cells where they are since it affects their mortality finally at the end of the cycle female moths can sense if there is a male moth within a certain distance and where the surrounding pines are see mating and oviposition submodels in section 3 3 3 3 no prediction or learning mechanisms are implemented in instar agents interact with each other in an indirect way colonies within the same host compete with each other for their food when the number of colonies on a host equals its carrying capacity the biomass consumption will slowly lead to complete defoliation of the tree and therefore to the death of larvae present on it see colony mortality submodel in section 3 3 3 1 moreover there are intra and intergenerational interactions the intragenerational interaction appears when colonies turn into clusters of pupae and these into moths as development takes place inheriting state variables values the number of individuals of the cluster of pupae is inherited from the number of individuals of the colony it comes from and the number of moths that emerge from the burial site is defined by the number of individuals within the parent cluster of pupae moreover the location of each agent is defined based on the location of its predecessor on the other hand the intergenerational interaction comes from the defoliation of one season defining the quality state of the host in the coming season and thus affecting the probability of survival of the coming generation of larvae to simulate the intrinsic variability of natural processes several stochastic processes are included during instar initialisation assigning quantity to hosts assigning number of individuals to colonies assigning days as egg to colonies and selecting which are the initial infected hosts moreover pseudorandom numbers are also used during the model running to assign moth sex 1 1 ratio decide whether a female moth becomes mated or not once it finds a male moth and choose the hosts where moths lay their eggs following a weighted random selection based on distance to the moth these functions are explained in details in the corresponding submodels descriptions section 3 3 3 the representation of t pityocampa biological cycle in three agent types responds to a necessity to simulate the behaviour and characteristics of each development phase colonies and clusters of pupae are in a way collectives since they represent a group of individuals this assumption does not constitute an oversimplification of the real system considering the characteristic gregarious behaviour of this species where colonies behave as fully functional units démolin 1969b besides defining them as collectives is an advantage since it reduces computing power needs thus allowing the simulation of larger areas to observe the pest dynamics and hosts state instar provides several outputs at system level average hosts quantity percentage of infected pines and number of individuals of t pityocampa at each life stage are stored for each day moreover monthly averages of all these state variables are also stored at cell level this allows the evaluation of the forest pest development over time for a whole landscape unit i e a specific forest a basin etc as well as within the simulated area stand edges distribution and movement of each phase most affected hosts etc 3 3 details abms often require a high number of parameters and detailed information is needed to fully parameterise the model kelly letcher et al 2013 thus as any other abm instar parameterisation requires an exhaustive review of literature as well as testing during last 20 years we produced and recorded data on t pityocampa in sierra nevada and surrounding areas se spain regarding phenology relationship with altitude egg parasitoidism or tree species selection and therefore the model is based on these local data whenever possible when unavailable data were taken from scientific literature elsewhere the parameters used by instar are listed in table 2 and decisions for parameter estimation are fully explained in appendix a in any case instar was built as a customisable model in which parameter values can be changed to fit biological information to local conditions as well as to incorporate new information when it becomes available constituting one of its potential some of instar parameter values are well referenced pest traits csmean cssd processionmax distance matingprob or have been based on best available knowledge considering certain assumptions egg min l1 min l2 min pupae max npp qlthreshold see section 3 3 3 2 and appendix a other parameters require calibration for each study area tegg devel tlarvae devel high tlarvae devel internal tlarvae devel low as presented in this manuscript finally another set of parameters are required for model functioning and can serve in the future for purposes such as scenario setting qtmean qtsd l1mort l2mort l2mort threshold or pest expansion experiments matingmax distance flightmax distance tlethal max tlethal min 3 3 1 initialisation instar is initialised by creating cells and hosts and assigning their state variables values for the simulated area elevation host location and height are loaded as input data see section 3 3 2 moth probability of emergence is then calculated for each cell based on number of hosts on it as follows p r o b a b i l i t y o f e m e r g e n c e 0 12 i f h i 3 0 1636 0 0169 h i i f 3 h i 10 0 i f h i 10 where h i is the number of hosts in cell i this function assumes that the number of hosts per cell is a good surrogate of shaded surface which affects soil moisture and temperature these seem to be the main factors explaining the cluster of pupae emergence rate according to torres muros et al 2017 who reported mortality and emergence rates of cluster of pupae based on vegetation cover and soil moisture above 10 hosts per cell full coverage was assumed and therefore cause the probability of emergence to be 0 below 3 hosts per cell no effect on surface coverage was considered and therefore maximum probability of emergence was assigned following data from torres muros et al 2017 a linear relationship was assumed between these two values resulting in the above mentioned function after this quantity and quality values of hosts are assigned the quantity assigned to each host is based on a normal distribution with mean qtmean and standard deviation qtsd therefore allowing the user to setup the initial state of the pine stand quality is defined as defoliated or not defoliated according to a threshold value qlthreshold three extra internal variables are calculated for hosts the carrying capacity cc of each host the number of colonies that a pine can host it is calculated based on observations relating the number of colonies on highly defoliated trees and tree height briefly the number of winter colonies in trees suffering a severe 90 defoliation was related to the height of the tree for 20 pines of a pine plantation near sierra nevada protected area unpublished data from j a hódar see appendix a for details in this way estimate of how many colonies are needed to completely defoliate a tree depending on its size height is obtained cc 11 63 x ln height 4 60 r2 0 65 the daily consumption per colony consumption the relative amount of biomass consumed per day by one colony in l2 stage given the carrying capacity cc of the host on which it is feeding it is calculated by assuming that all colonies consume the same amount of biomass per day regardless of the number of individuals in it it also assumes that colonies feed during the minimum number of days needed for a colony in l2 stage to develop into a cluster of pupae i e 90 days and considering full consumption a defoliation of 90 in agreement with observations used for the carrying capacity calculations which are as follows consumption 90 cc x 90 1 cc and moth suitableness mu of each host which is calculated as mu σ count x coefficient i where i corresponds to the cardinal and intercardinal directions i e north northeast east etc the count is the number of trees in each direction i at a radius of 1 cell 30 m and each coefficient provides a weighting see appendix b for the influence on each direction of the suitableness of a tree for the moth this weighting creates an initial distribution of colonies in which there are more colonies on more exposed trees which is what happens in the real world since burials occur in clear spots and moths choose a host based on the distance to their emergence point afterwards colonies are initialised the number of colonies to be created is defined by the percentage of infected pines which can be set by the user as a model input in this study real data from a defoliation monitoring programme within the andalusia region southern spain are used this programme assigns a defoliation value from 0 no defoliation to 5 complete defoliation to each forest plot at the end of every defoliating season these data are used to define the percentage of infected pines and thus the number of colonies present in the landscape colonies are then distributed among the hosts by weighted random selection based on moth suitableness the higher the moth suitableness the less probability for the host to be infected i e to have colonies on it colonies are initialised as egg stage with days as egg corresponding to a random number between 0 and egg min 3 3 2 input data instar uses a set of input data as follows map of elevation for the simulated area obtained from the andalusian network of environmental information rediam in a raster format and 30 30 m resolution daily maps of meteorological variables maximum and minimum temperature for the simulated area and period these maps are raster files generated by a hydrometeorological model interpolating data from weather stations at 30 30 m resolution herrero et al 2007 see appendix c for more details in this study the meteorological dataset corresponds to years 2008 2013 see section 4 for more details map of the pines present in the simulated forest this map is a vector file derived from airborne laser scanning data which contains the location and height of trees more details about this processing in appendix d all identified trees are considered to be pines i e hosts initial percentage of infested pines in this study this percentage was based on defoliation data from andalusian defoliation monitoring programme this dataset provides an infestation rate based on observed defoliation for each plot within the region on a 0 5 scale the initial percentage of infested pines is calculated based on the defoliation assigned by the monitoring programme to the plot where the simulated area is located this dataset is fully documented by ros candeira et al 2019 3 3 3 submodels instar uses a series of submodels to simulate the development of the pest as well as its interactions with the hosts and the cells fig 1 these submodels make use of best available current knowledge about t pityocampa but have been built in such a way that will allow an easy integration of new information as knowledge on this pest increases as an example if new information on pupae distribution is found the procession submodel could be adjusted to follow such distribution by including a kernel function these submodels can be classified into three types mortality development and movement 3 3 3 1 mortality submodels mortality submodels simulate the death of organisms due to abiotic or biotic conditions since some of instar agents represent groups of organisms some mortality factors apply to the agent as a whole i e they cause the death of a whole colony while others apply to a portion of the individuals that the agent represents i e they cause the reduction in the number of individuals of a colony instar applies mortality submodels to colonies and clusters of pupae while moth mortality is already included in pupae mortality and hosts do not have an associated mortality submodel since t pityocampa rarely causes pine death the submodel colony mortality can reduce the number of individuals of the colonies or kill whole colonies to simulate mortality rates due to different abiotic and biotic factors such mortality rates differ between each stage at the beginning of stage egg when the colony is created a mortality factor due to parasitism is applied mortality is calculated based on torres muros 2015 it considers elevation to be a proxy for egg parasitism and causes the original number of individuals to be reduced as follows number of individualsafter mortality number of individualsoriginal pi where pi eni 1 eni and ni 0 2082 0 0006 elevation where pi is the percentage of individuals which survive at a cell i at stage l1 two mortality factors are applied the first one is related to quality of the host and is applied at the beginning of this stage when eggs become l1 if quality is defoliated number of individuals is reduced by a certain percentage l1mort the second factor is due to lethal temperatures and is applied every day the whole colony dies if maximum temperature is higher than tlethal max or minimum temperature is below tlethal min at stage l2 two mortality factors are also applied every day the first one is related to scarcity of food if quantity of the host is below a certain threshold l2mort threshold number of individuals is reduced by a certain percentage l2mort the second factor is the same as for stage l1 the whole colony dies if maximum temperature is higher than tlethal max or minimum temperature is below tlethal min the submodel pupae mortality affects the variable number of individuals of the cluster of pupae to simulate mortality rates due to shading torres muros et al 2017 which is assumed to be related to the number of hosts on a cell a mortality factor is applied at the beginning of this phase when colonies in stage l2 become a cluster of pupae the state variable probability of emergence defines the percentage of number of individuals which survive and result in the number of moths which are created see pupae development submodel section 3 3 3 2 number of individualsafter mortality number of individualsoriginal probability of emergence no mortality submodel is applied to moth agents since it has been included in the probability of emergence of pupae mortality submodel 3 3 3 2 development submodels development submodels are used to simulate how an organism increases its biomass over time or how it changes to the next stage of its life cycle these submodels are depicted in fig 1 in instar hosts colonies and clusters of pupae have an associated development submodel while a moths development submodel is not required based on the assumption that all moths live one day the submodel hosts development defines how quantity and quality state variables change over time the quantity of a host on a given day is defined as quantity t quantity t 1 consumption growth where consumption daily consumption per colony number of l2 colonies on the host growth npp between april and august and 0 the rest of the year regarding quality this variable is assessed before the growing season starts i e on the 31 st march quality will be defined as defoliated if quantity at that moment is below qlthreshold and not defoliated otherwise the submodel colonies development sets the time that is needed for a colony to change its stage and eventually become a cluster of pupae through procession submodel each colony stage has a counter as state variable days as egg days as l1 and days as l2 respectively which defines the length of each stage in number of days when the counter of each stage reaches 0 the following stage starts from egg to l1 and from l1 to l2 finally colonies in stage l2 will perform the procession submodel when days as l2 become 0 these counters are initially set to the minimum length of each phase based on literature egg min l1 min l2 min but they will be extended under certain conditions if maximum temperature is below tegg devel egg stage will be extended by one day i e instar halts the development of eggs on those days where temperature is lower than the threshold tegg devel if maximum temperature is above tlarvae devel high and the integrated temperature is below tlarvae devel internal l1 stage will be extended by one day moreover if minimum temperature is below tlarvae devel low l1 stage will be further extended by one day same rules apply to l2 stage in other words instar halts larval development when temperatures are not high enough for larvae to digest the biomass they have ingested but in addition also when temperatures a too low for larvae to leave their nests to feed extension in colony stages causes the following pupae phase to decrease in the same length see pupae development submodel section 3 3 3 2 in order to maintain a univoltine cycle as literature refers berardi et al 2015 the submodel pupae development sets the length of the phase cluster of pupae within the lifecycle of the processionary by adjusting the days as pupae state variable similar to colony development submodel days as pupae are decreased by 1 in every time step when it becomes 0 the cluster of pupae disappears and becomes a certain number of moths the number of moths which are then created is defined by number of individuals for the sake of simplicity instar does not consider extended diapause as our study area is located in the mediterranean area where t pityocampa rarely engage in extended diapause see section 2 nevertheless a submodel implementing this phenomenon could be easily integrated 3 3 3 3 movement submodels movement submodels are used to describe processes where an agent selects a place to move to based on information from its surroundings three movement submodels are defined in instar procession which simulates the search for a burial spot performed by colonies in l2 stage mating which simulates the search of a male moth performed by female moths and oviposition which simulates the selection of a host to lay the eggs on i e creation of a new colony and is performed by mated female moths the procession submodel defines the place where colonies at stage l2 and days as l2 equal to 0 become a cluster of pupae agents performing this submodel search among the surrounding cells within processionmax distance and select the ones with the lowest pine density i e number of pines in cell if several cells have the smallest pine density they choose the closest one among them a cluster of pupae is created in that cell and the colony disappears the state variables of the newly created cluster of pupae are inherited from the parent colony number of individuals corresponds to the number of individuals of the parent colony and days as pupae equals pupae max minus the number of days that the parent colony was extended see colony development submodel description the mating submodel defines which moths will become mated and where they will be located after mating female moths become mated with a probability matingprob if there is at least one male moth within matingmax distance when this happens mated moths move halfway towards their partner the submodel oviposition selects the host on which a new colony will be created i e the host to which the new colony will be linked to after mating mated moths choose a host to lay their eggs within flightmax distance weighted random selection is used to define which will be the selected host this selection gives a higher probability of being chosen the closer the host is to the moth if no host is found no colony is created the state variables of the newly created colony are defined as number of individuals corresponds to a random number within a normal distribution with mean csmean and standard deviation cssd stage is egg and days as egg equals egg min the other state variables are set to 0 4 model consistency test instar has been written in netlogo language wilensky 1999 and reviewed in an iterative process by a multidisciplinary team consisting of computer scientists modellers and ecologists an independent implementation of each individual submodel has been used to check that the model agrees with the conceptual model initially proposed by torres muros 2015 or in other words for model verification in the sense of findeisen et al 1978 the last instar stable version can be freely downloaded from github http sl ugr es github instar and run under a netlogo free licence https ccl northwestern edu netlogo besides this a demo execution of instar can be run at https vlab geodab eu a virtual laboratory promoted by ecopotential project https ecopotential project eu 4 1 methodology pattern oriented modelling led instar design and helped to decide which processes should be included in the model as recommended by wiegand et al 2003 the most important pattern regarding pine processionary population dynamics corresponds to phenology which is mainly driven by temperature thus in order to be coherent and structurally realistic instar should faithfully reproduce the effect of this factor on the species phenology the submodels involved in this process are development submodels section 3 3 3 2 and therefore a calibration of the parameters involved in these submodels has been performed besides this a stress test was simulated by defining extreme climate scenarios as input data stress tests often help to identify unexpected behaviours which cannot be detected when the model is run under normal conditions and therefore extreme unrealistic inputs are used in these tests railsback and grimm 2011 these experiments constitute a first internal validation of the development submodels fig 2 since they can help with confirming hypothesis and observing unexpected model behaviours after these tests parameterisation and sensitivity analysis are needed before the model can be fully applied a virtual experimental area was created for this analysis by using a combination of real and built in datasets see appendix e for more details this virtual area is 15 12 cells large covering an area of 450 360 m2 16 2 ha the location is real sierra nevada protected area south eastern spain at an elevation of 1706 34 m a s l and contains 1128 pine trees which have been extracted using an existing lidar dataset see section 3 3 2 finally the climatic data needed to conduct the consistency analysis were generated by wimmed hydrological model see section 3 3 2 and correspond to years 2008 2013 4 1 1 phenology calibration each phase in t pityocampa s life cycle shows a characteristic phenology which shifts each year within certain limits depending on climate conditions thus testing whether instar reproduces a realistic phenology constitute one of the first steps to validate the model in order to test whether the phenology of the model reproduces field observations a calibration of the colonies development submodel was performed the parameters involved in this submodel are the temperature thresholds regulating the length of each phase and the minimum lengths of each stage see table 2 this calibration analysis aims to find the values of the parameters tegg devel tlarvae devel high tlarvae devel low and tlarvae devel internal that best reproduce the species phenology in the study area instar results were calibrated against field observations provided by the sierra nevada global change observatory bollullos and aspizua 2014 the observations consist on a dataset reporting hatching procession and egg laying dates recorded for several plots within the sierra nevada mountain range during years 2009 2010 and 2011 a summary of this dataset can be observed in table 3 calibration was performed following a stepwise approach egg development calibration followed by larvae development calibration in the first step the parameter tegg devel which modulates how long the stage egg takes by adjusting days as egg was calibrated in order to obtain simulated hatching dates within the range of the above mentioned observations for this analysis a systematic execution of the model was performed with values of tegg devel ranging from 15 to 25 c in 1 c steps every simulation was run in triplicate lasted 4 months and was initialised at julian day 210 of the corresponding year 2009 2010 and 2011 for each simulation the hatching date of each colony was recorded and the difference between observed and simulated average hatching date was calculated as a metric of model fit once the parameter tegg devel was calibrated the second step of the calibration took place the parameters tlarvae devel high tlarvae devel low and tlarvae devel internal were calibrated to obtain procession dates within the range of the above mentioned observations these parameters affect how long the stages l1 and l2 take by adjusting days as l1 and days as l2 see section 3 3 3 2 for this analysis a new systematic execution of the model was performed a range of values for each parameter was tested 20 30 c for tlarvae devel high 15 25 c for tlarvae devel internal and 15 to 5 c for tlarvae devel low in 1 c step resulting in 1331 combinations of parameter values simulations were initialised with colonies at stage l1 to avoid noise coming from the previous stage each simulation was started on julian day 226 of the corresponding year and lasted 9 months therefore extending to the beginning of next year thus input datasets correspond to years 2008 2009 2009 2010 and 2010 2011 the initialisation date corresponds to the average hatching date derived from the previous experiment for each combination of parameter values and input dataset five replicates were run finally to avoid noise coming from other submodels mortality submodels based on host quality and quantity were disabled and the procession submodel was unconstrained colonies could bury in all cells around them in this case the procession date of each colony was recorded in each simulation and the difference between observed and simulated average procession date was calculated as a measure of model fit the above described stepwise calibration was based on hatching and procession dates within 1 cycle runs once the involved parameters are calibrated it becomes necessary to test whether the selected parameter values reproduce the phenology pattern over the years to test these criteria instar was run for the period 2008 2011 using the selected values for parameters tegg devel tlarvae devel high tlarvae devel internal and tlarvae devel low 4 1 2 extreme climate stress test by exposing the model to extreme climate we aim to test the model consistency in relation to temperature influence on pest development as mentioned at the beginning of this section extreme unrealistic inputs are used in these tests in order to observe divergent behaviours in the model against normal input data thus three input scenarios were used in this experiment normal corresponding to the daily maps obtained from measured temperatures minus10 and plus10 scenarios minus10 and plus10 were generated by respectively subtracting and adding an offset 10 c to the measured temperatures in order to reach lethal temperatures for the processionary moth and test whether instar simulates development and mortality due to extreme temperatures as expected the offset was applied equally to maximum and minimum temperatures therefore maintaining the thermal range simulations were run in triplicate for the period 2008 2013 considering these scenarios larval development is expected to be accelerated when temperatures are high and delayed when they are low moreover larvae mortality rates are expected to increase even causing pest annihilation due to the higher occurrence of extreme temperatures above or below the species survivability thresholds 4 2 results 4 2 1 phenology calibration results from the egg development calibration can be observed in fig 3 which shows the difference between observed and simulated average hatching date for each year along the tegg devel tested gradient the line indicates the mean of the difference among all three years data from year 2009 show differences of less than 2 days between simulated and observed mean hatching date for tegg devel values 15 22 c data from years 2010 and 2011 show higher differences above 5 days for tegg devel values 15 22 c for tegg devel values 23 25 c the trend changes and all differences range between 3 5 and 7 5 days when the mean difference among all years is analysed small fluctuations are observed the minimum value is found for 4 8 days corresponding to tegg devel equal to 22 c and the maximum value 6 0 days is reached for tegg devel equal to 25 c considering these results the selected value for tegg devel corresponds to 22 c once the egg phase was calibrated larvae development calibration was carried out difference in average procession date between observations and simulations which has been considered as the calibration metric for larvae development phase was calculated for each combination of parameter values and seasons the minimum difference across years corresponds to 2 5 days and is found for tlarvae devel high equal to 27 c tlarvae devel internal equal to 25 c and tlarvae devel low equal to 8 c followed by all other tlarvae devel low tested values except for 5 c data not shown fig 4 shows the mean difference for the three years along the tested values for parameters tlarvae devel high and tlarvae devel intern tlarvae devel low fixed to 8 c a local minimum can also be observed for tlarvae devel high equal to 22 c tlarvae devel intern equal to 23 c this local minimum however is not so clearly observed for data regarding each year separately see fig 11a c in appendix f the influence of parameter tlarvae devel low can be observed in fig 5 differences generally remain below 10 days for all years and parameter values small differences are obtained for year 2008 2009 for most parameter values except for tlarvae devel low equal to 5 c year 2009 2010 shows the highest differences for values below 9 c while year 2010 2011 shows fluctuating differences if the mean across years is considered a consistent increase can be noticed for values 7 c to 5 c as mentioned above the minimum difference is found at 8 c the influence of parameter tlarvae devel low when the local minima of tlarvae devel high equals 22 c tlarvae devel intern equals 23 c can be observed in fig 12 in the appendix f resulting in higher differences for most values and years it should be noted that parameter tlarvae devel low is evaluated only when maximum daily temperature is above tlarvae devel high and or integrated daily temperature is below tlarvae devel intern see section 3 3 3 2 which could explain the seemly erratic behaviour of this parameter once the above described parameters were calibrated results of the simulation regarding species phenology using the selected values for parameters tegg devel tlarvae devel high tlarvae devel internal and tlarvae devel low 22 c 27 c 25 c and 8 c respectively are shown in fig 6 which also shows the observed phenology egg layings fall within the observed ranges for years 2009 and 2011 but tend towards earlier dates for year 2010 in comparison to observations hatchings and processions occur within the observed range for all three years 4 2 2 extreme climate stress test pest dynamics for each scenario are shown in fig 7 as expected high larvae mortality rates resulted in a reduced number of individuals in both minus10 and plus10 scenarios compared to the normal scenario in the minus10 scenario the population was greatly limited fig 7a under the plus10 scenario however larvae mortality due to high temperatures was as high as to cause full annihilation of the pest before the first cycle was completed fig 7b 5 discussion to the best of our knowledge instar is the first abm simulating the population dynamics of the pine processionary moth this is a spatially explicit model which constitutes an advantage in comparison to other published models such as robinet et al 2014 seixas arnaldo and monteiro torres 2005 or régolini et al 2014 the model aims to improve our understanding of the pest s population dynamics and identify gaps in our knowledge the design and implementation of instar constitutes an effort to synthesize the available knowledge about the target species while it allows an easy integration of newly produced knowledge under a structural point of view instar has been built considering all the ontological stages of the target species eggs larvae pupae and moths the concepts of colony and cluster as an agent types are used to represent groups of eggs larvae or pupae while moths are represented as individual agents the model is build following a modular structure with three submodel classes development mortality and movement the classification of submodels into a reduced number of classes helps to overcome some of the most common critics to abms the difficulties of reproducing them standardising their structures and defining guidelines to design calibrate and evaluate them deangelis and grimm 2014 thus the modular structure of instar eases the exchange of information among modellers as well as the comparison between models such a structure improves the understanding of the model and facilitates communication with non modellers moreover it could constitute a framework to build models simulating other forest pests in a wide variety of ecological systems since it summarises the key biological processes that take place in them as an example movement submodels could be adjusted to simulate the dispersal and establishment of mistletoe another common pest in pine plantations by following mellado and zamora 2016 t pityocampa is a poikilotherm species and therefore air temperature plays a key role in its performance moreover the distribution and density of pine plantation stands has been demonstrated to be another important factor explaining the population dynamics of the species dulaurent et al 2011 li et al 2015 torres muros et al 2017 thus instar considers climate and land use as the main forcing variables or drivers in this manuscript the role of temperature in instar has been calibrated and analysed parameters involved in development submodels have been calibrated using phenology observations from sierra nevada spain and the difference between observed and simulated average hatching and procession date as a measure of model fit the egg phase showed small differences maximum 9 days for all tested parameter values and years the parameter value selected corresponds to the one which minimises the difference in observed and simulated average hatching date for all three years tegg devel 22 c larvae phase shows important differences for different parameter values and years this implies that larvae phase is the main responsible for the phenology within instar the parameter set selected for larvae development corresponds to the one which minimises the difference for all years tlarvae devel high 27 c tlarvae devel intern 25 c and tlarvae devel low 8 c this set also resulted in small differences for each year separately and causes the model to successfully reproduce the species phenology through a multiple year simulation besides this instar behaviour when exposed to extreme climate has also been analysed extremely low temperatures minus10 scenario have a severe impact on the number of larvae but not on the eggs this is explained by the fact that the egg mortality implemented in the model is only due to parasitism which is not linked with temperature the model could be improved in this regard by also including egg mortality due to lethal temperature following rocha et al 2017 and the effect of temperature on parasitism rates following tiberi et al 2015 when exposed to extremely high temperatures plus10 scenario the behaviour is quite different this scenario causes a total annihilation of the pest during the first year of the execution in other words an extreme increase in temperature such as the one caused by plus10 scenario seem to cause most cells in the landscape to reach maximum lethal temperatures our simulated area represents a warm region of the distribution area of the pest therefore the population is probably closer to its high temperature threshold than to its lower one resulting in this scenario causing the population collapse which cannot be observed under the minus10 scenario i e a change of the same scale towards low temperatures does not cause as many cells to reach minimum lethal temperatures nevertheless these statements should be taken cautiously the parameter values have been taken from literature they refer to air temperatures and represent the general knowledge of t pityocampa the actual lethal values may differ for different populations and been influenced by other factors e g wind speed shading which can modulate the actual temperature to which larvae are exposed another reason for the difference between scenarios can be that at higher temperatures eggs develop faster and hatching is anticipated causing the larvae to be exposed to the high summer temperatures literature suggests that t pityocampa adapts to areas with warm summers by delaying the egg phase to late summer thus avoiding lethal temperatures chapter 2 in roques 2015 at the moment instar does not possess a mechanism simulating this process since initialisation is fixed at a certain date as it is commonly done in processes which deal with seasonal and annual patterns such as hydrological models this limitation however can be overcome by calibrating the initialisation date for the area to be simulated based on field data to sum up phenology has been calibrated successfully according to the field observations however more knowledge about the drivers modulating the biological cycle of the species would be required for a more realistic modelling this article is focused on the phenological aspects of the processionary moth although this is a very important process in order to correctly simulate the population dynamics of the pest its spatial distribution should be addressed by calibrating and parameterising movement submodels however data on movements by the pine processionary moth are difficult to obtain and literature often refers to non natural conditions such as flight distance measured under laboratory conditions sauvard and yart in battisti et al 2015 or extreme values robredo 1963 moreover assessing the impact of the pest at a landscape scale requires high resolution data such as quantifying per larvae biomass consumption although larvae weight gain has been studied avtzis 1986 no reference for biomass consumption has been found this has avoided a more realistic modelisation of the host pest interaction due to the interest on forest health pests are commonly monitored by assessing their impact as defoliation or other stress signals on the host trumbore et al 2015 in the case of the pine processionary moth the number of colonies is also often monitored and reported instar uses this type of information for the calculation of the trees carrying capacity see section 3 3 1 and appendix a however data at a higher resolution i e number of larvae per colony at different stages is not available and such information would be particularly valuable to improve how the host pest interaction is modelled and to calibrate the mortality submodels in general terms information and field observations about movement and mortality parameters are scarce and therefore an important gap of knowledge exists in this respect instar is focused on the processionary moth and therefore host development is modelled in a very simple way this submodel could be further improved by considering more a complex relationship of pine activity with climate differences among pine species or linkages between primary production and topographic soil features this could be done by coupling instar with independent models such as the ones proposed by faias et al 2012 simulating stand growth and development due to the inherent characteristics of abms there is a high degree of uncertainty in the model and a high number of parameters which will require calibration and parameterisation kelly letcher et al 2013 thus further work should focus on determining the parameters which have the strongest impact on model outputs i e sensitivity analysis and identifying model uncertainty sources once the model is fully calibrated and validated simulations can be considered as in silico performed experiments that are not feasible in the real world instar could then help to forecast the probability of occurrence and intensity of the pest outbreaks on pine plantations under different climate and land use scenarios thus in the long term instar could be useful for the environmental decision makers in charge of managing the large area covered by pine plantations affected by this pest 6 conclusions current available knowledge on t pityocampa has been synthesized and integrated into instar an abm aiming to simulate the population dynamics of this species in this article we present instar model structure according to a standard protocol specifically designed to document abms increasing its usability and reproducibility moreover we have conducted a consistency test which constitutes a first internal validation of the model the experiments presented here assess how the model simulates the development of the pest driven by temperature once the model has been calibrated it successfully reproduces the phenology observed for a given area this means that the submodels responsible for the development within instar are well designed and implemented moreover the model behaves as expected when exposed to extreme input values through a climate stress test extreme high temperatures cause full annihilation of the pest before the first cycle is completed and extreme low temperatures greatly limit the pest population further work should focus on testing and calibration of pest spatial distribution as well as overall sensitivity and uncertainty analysis author contributions maría suárez muñoz leaded the manuscript writing process as
